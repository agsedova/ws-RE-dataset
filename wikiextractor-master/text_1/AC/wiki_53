{"id": "2118462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118462", "title": "Burghfield", "text": "Burghfield\n\nBurghfield is a village and large civil parish in West Berkshire, England, with a boundary with Reading. Burghfield can trace its history back to before the Domesday book, and was once home to three manors: Burghfield Regis, Burghfield Abbas and Sheffield (or Soefeld). Since the 1980s the population of Burghfield has nearly doubled with the construction of many new housing estates, dependent for its employment (that of commuters) on, for instance, Reading, Newbury and Basingstoke and M4 corridor which bisects the edge of the area.\n\nMost of the formerly sparsely inhabited fields of the hamlet or locality of Pingewood, in the north of the parish, are divided by the M4 motorway and have been converted after gravel extraction in the mid to late 20th century into lakes and their shores mostly used for water sports, fishing, and other leisure activities. They are also a habitat for migrating geese, water fowl and other wildlife. A few higher pits/quarries in this area have been drained, clay-lined and used as landfill.\n\nBurghfield has many amenities — the majority are sports clubs and facilities, including a leisure centre, educational or religious.\n\nA \"Burh\" is an Old English name for a fortified town or other defended site, (e.g., at Burgh Castle), sometimes centred upon a hill fort though always intended as a place of permanent settlement, its origin was in military defence; \"it represented only a stage, though a vitally important one, in the evolution of the medieval English borough and of the medieval town\", H. R. Loyn asserted. The boundaries of ancient burhs can often still be traced to modern urban borough limits. Most of these were founded by Alfred the Great in a consciously planned policy that was continued under his son Edward the Elder and his daughter, Æthelflaed, \"Lady of the Mercians\" and her husband Æthelred, Ealdorman of Mercia; the Mercian Register tells of the building of ten \"burhs\" by Aethelflaed, some as important as Tamworth and Stafford, others now unidentifiable. Some were based on pre-existing Roman structures, some newly built, though some may have been built later. Athelstan granted these burhs the right to mint coinage, and in the tenth and eleventh centuries the firm rule was that no coin was to be struck outside a burh.\n\nA 10th-century document called the Burghal Hidage cites 30 burhs in Wessex and three in Mercia (then under the domination of the West Saxon kings), built to defend the region against Viking raids.\n\nThe Old English word was related to the verb \"beorgan\" (cf. Dutch and German \"bergen\"), meaning \"to keep, save, make secure\". In German \"\" means castle or fortress, though so many towns grew up around castles that it almost came to mean \"city\", and is incorporated into many placenames, such as Hamburg, Flensburg and Strasbourg.\n\nA place, probably in Berkshire, appearing as \"Yerburghfeld\" is seen in 1381. It may refer to Burghfield, or perhaps, Arborfield \n\nBurghfield is about southwest of Reading. The parish, sharing in its amenities, is bifocal or polyfocal: Its two main populated areas are Burghfield Common and Burghfield Village; its small hamlets include Burghfield Bridge, Pingewood, Burghfield Hill, Trash Green, Whitehouse Green and Sheffield Bottom. The area is relatively large and of varying density.\nIn 1923 the parish of Burghfield had 4,309 acres of land, of which 1,660 acres were arable, 1,940 acres permanent pasture and 163 acres woods and plantations. The land lies low in the valley of the Kennet, at an average altitude of a little over above the ordnance datum, rising in the south-west to a height of .\n\nThe main settlements of Burghfield parish lie along Burghfield Road, the major road out of Reading. From north-east to south-west: Burghfield Bridge is the closest to Reading and lies by the crossing of the Reading Road over the River Kennet; this is followed by Burghfield Village, after the crossing of the Burghfield Road over the M4 motorway which runs through the north of the parish; Burghfield Hill is in the southern upland part of the parish, naturally enough, at the top of Burghfield Hill; and Burghfield Common – named after the parish common land on which it was built and with by far the largest population – lies, in quick succession, the furthest south-west. The south-eastern part of Burghfield Common is known as Great Auclum (see History below). A corner of north-western Burghfield Common is actually in Sulhamstead parish.\n\nIn the north of the parish, the Kennet River valley, is surrounded by a number of man made lakes, marshland and willow scrub, with old water meadows and Osier beds to the north of the river. Further south, between the M4 motorway and Burghfield Village the ground is flat, and consists of farmland and pastureland with occasional small stands of deciduous woodland. At Burghfield Hill, the slopes are covered in grassland and some larger copses of deciduous woodland, and are dissected by a number of partially wooded valleys and small streams such as Clayhill Brook. The plateau gravels support grassland, deciduous woodland and Scots pine, with small areas of heath land persisting on Wokefield Common which borders Burghfield Common to the south. The grasslands within the Parish are grazed by a wide variety of cattle, sheep and horses.\n\nThe parish is served by a number of footpaths and bridleways across the fields and open spaces as well as through the woods. These paths and bridleways can be enjoyed by walkers and nature lovers, and are an important resource for the Parish. There are a number of other paths and \"cut-throughs\" allowing pedestrians to move freely around the Parish, away from motorised traffic.\n\nThe parish lies in an area of clay, gravel and sand which was laid down in shallow, marine, coastal and fluvial river environments. The oldest sediments comprise sands deposited in a shallow sea overlain by reddish-brown \"Reading Formation\" clays. These later sediments were deposited on marshy mudflats crossed by river channels. Named after the Reading area, these largely fossil-poor clay outcrops in a narrow strip between the Chalk and the overlying London Clay. The dark bluish to brownish London Clay outcrops in a broad swathe between Windsor and Burghfield, and along the valley of the River Kennet towards Newbury. This was originally deposited in a shallow sub-tropical sea and contains the fossils of many marine animals such as bivalves, gastropods and sharks; as well as the remains of many species of plants, such as the seeds of palms, climbers, magnolias and mangroves. These can also be found in the surrounding London Clay and were probably washed out to sea by large rivers.\n\nMuch of the Kennet Valley is defined as a functional flood plain, and is as a consequence subject to frequent flooding. There are areas in the flow of the river Kennet where drainage is not as good as it might be. There are also areas where the streams and rivers taking water away are nearing capacity and therefore heavy rains lead to localised flooding.\n\nSince 1938 there has been much gravel extraction in the north of the parish, especially at Pingewood, which has led to the loss of many farms and cottages within the hamlet. In recent years the empty pits have been used for landfill waste. A number of earlier pits have been left to fill with water, and this has provided for various water sports, fishing and other leisure activities, as well as supporting a large water bird population along with other aquatic flora and fauna.\n\nThe parish includes a number of important areas for local wildlife. Of particular significance is the extensive wetland area in the Kennet Valley which has been created following the extraction of gravel from what are currently lakes, and is now a haven for a wide range of water birds and other protected bird species, such as the nightingale, and the red kite; together with kestrels, buzzards and peregrine falcons, the latter of which can often be seen on thermals enjoying this habitat of the Kennet Meadows.\n\nThe parish is largely bounded by rivers, brooks and streams. The Clayhill Brook partially forms its Northwestern border with Sulhamstead. This brook travels north and north-east to eventually join the River Kennet and Kennet and Avon Canal near to Burghfield Mill, to the West of Burghfield Bridge.\n\nThe stream The Teg gently winds its way through the heart of Burghfield Common. Its source is close to the Willink school and much interesting wildlife can be found long its length. The Teg winds Northeast and then East to join Foudry Brook, a tributary of the River Kennet and Kennet and Avon Canal, just South of Reading.\n\nThe Burghfield Brook forms Burghfield's southern border with Wokefield and Grazeley; a notable feature of this watercourse is Pullens Pond, formed where this brook is damned by a forest access road within Wokefield Common. To the East of this area the brook continues into a small valley, referred to as Burghfield Slade, which contains a larger reservoir of water. Burghfield Brook then continues to the Northeast, and in turn feeds into Foudry Brook, just South of the Teg.\n\nBurghfields Eastern boundary is just east of the railway line, near Smallmead, running south from Reading. The northern boundary with Theale and the Southcote area of Reading is formed by the Holy Brook and the Draper's Osier Bed Stream.\n\nTo the north lies Sheffield Bottom and the River Kennet and Kennet and Avon Canal, which run through the very north of the parish and are, today, surrounded by vast flooded gravel pits where there is much wildlife and where fishing, sailing and other water sports are popular pastimes. The Kennet and Avon Canal is crossed by road in two places near the northern borders of the parish, firstly at Burghfield Bridge, being a stone built road bridge, and secondly at Sheffield Bottom by a swing type canal bridge and a stone built road bridge. The road crossings at both are very narrow and are controlled by traffic lights. This excludes smaller footbridges, and the much later M4 motorway crossing of the Kennet and Avon Canal.\n\nIn Sheffield Bottom, Hosehill Lake, a flooded gravel pit falling also within Sulhamstead parish, is listed as a nature reserve, and is managed by Berkshire Countryside Service alongside the Theale Area Bird Conservation Group. The lake is bounded by a footpath, of approximately one mile, with several seating and bird viewing areas. The main entrance to the reserve is opposite the Fox and Hounds Pub, Sunnyside, on Station Road, Sheffield Bottom (Theale). The site is important for its wildlife and habitats. It hosts a wide variety of water fowl in the winter, and nightingales join the butterflies and dragonflies in the spring.\n\nApart from the gravel pits, the non-residential portion of the area is mostly farmland. There are, however, still patches of scattered woodland: Bennetts Hill Copse, Brick Kiln Copse, Deans Copse, Jame's Copse, Pinge Wood, Amner's Wood, Clayhill Copse, Pondhouse Copse and Scratchface Copse. Wokefield Common in Wokefield Parish is on the border with Burghfield and is accessible by public footpaths at the end of Palmers Lane and Springwood Lane, both off Bunces Lane, Burghfield Common. Omer's Gully, on the northern edge of Burghfield Common, is within Sulhamstead parish.\n\nThere are numerous farms in the parish.\nMany farms to the North of Burghfield are now part of the Englefield Estate\n\nIn 2001, the population of Burghfield was recorded as 5,894. In 1961, it was only 2,323. Burghfield has a parish council served by 19 parish councillors, as well as being part of the unitary authority of West Berkshire. The parish council has several committees and sub-committees arranged to serve the various functions of the council, these include for:\n\n\nBurghfield also has its own residents' association who organise the yearly May Fayre.\n\nThe UK Government's guidance is councils should pay close attention to the contents of civil parish councils' plans in the production of their Local Development Framework (LDF). Burghfield Parish Council published a draft Village Design Statement in November 2010 after acceptance by West Berkshire Council. Its aim is to define what makes living in Burghfield special, and it will be subsequently used by those wanting to develop in the Parish. The Parish Planning Committee will be able to refer to it as a guide to the architecture and facilities of the Parish.\n\nThe number of inhabitants in the parish has slowly risen over the last two centuries, but has risen sharply in the 1980s and 1990s as modern housing developments have been undertaken, and now has the population of a small market town.\nTransport in the parish is relatively restricted in terms of heavy vehicular access and public transport.\n\nThe main access road is a route from the A4 in Reading, through Burghfield to the south-western end of the parish, where the route splits in two, to continue towards Mortimer and Tadley respectively. This road is named Burghfield Road to the north-east of Burghfield Village, and Reading Road for the remainder of its length.\n\nPublic transport is provided by the number 2 and 2a buses after a re-number and re-brand and new identity as a \"vitality\" bus on 20 April 2009. The service, whose route lies along the Burghfield/Reading Road, is provided by Reading Buses. There is a minibus shuttle at peak times between Mortimer railway station which lies to the South, and Burghfield Common.\n\nHeavy vehicular access in the region is restricted by the multiple low and narrow bridges over the canal and railways which lie to the north and east.\n\nThe nearest railway stations to the parish are Theale railway station (on the Reading to Taunton Line) and Mortimer railway station (on the Reading to Basingstoke Line). Both stations are located approximately away – albeit in entirely opposite directions.\n\nThe parish includes Reading services on the M4 motorway, although the nearest access point to the motorway (junction 11) is located to the east.\n\nThe Kennet and Avon canal passes through the north of the parish. It links the River Kennet at Newbury to the River Avon at Bath, but forms just part of a larger navigation between the River Thames at Reading and the Floating Harbour at Bristol. The River Kennet was made navigable to Newbury in 1723, and the River Avon to Bath in 1727. The canal between Newbury and Bath opened in 1810.\n\nIn the later 19th century and early 20th century the canal fell into disuse following competition from the Great Western Railway, who owned the canal. In the latter half of the 20th century the canal was restored, largely by volunteers, and today is a popular heritage tourism destination, for boating, canoeing, fishing, walking and cycling. It is also important for wildlife conservation.\n\nThere are moorings on the Kennet and Avon Canal on the offside bank downstream of Burghfield Island and at the layby on Burghfield Island (near Burghfield Bridge). The canal has a number of locks, Sheffield Lock, Garston Lock and Burghfield Lock, and a swing-bridge along the Burghfield stretch.\n\nThere are now a number of services in Burghfield Common, including a recently opened Tesco Express (converted from the former Rising Sun pub); a Post Office with a Nisa-Today's supermarket; an Esso petrol station incorporating an 'On the run' mini-market; a pharmacy; the Forge Garage; two estate agents (Parker's and Davis Tate); a baker; a window and conservatory supplier; a pet food shop; a hairdresser; a greengrocer; a health centre; a public library and a public swimming pool (both adjacent to The Willink School); a veterinary surgery; a Co-op small supermarket; a \"Village stores\"; a Bangladeshi restaurant/takeaway (\"Bahgecha\"); a Chinese takeaway; and a Burger and Grill fast food joint. There is also a Village Hall in the area.\n\nThere are several public houses in Burghfield. The Hatch Gate and The Six Bells sit opposite each other in Burghfield Village, either side of the main Burghfield (Reading) Road. In Burghfield Common there is The Bantam, and formerly The Rising Sun which closed in 2011. In Sheffield Bottom is the Fox and Hounds. At Burghfield Bridge is the Cunning Man, which was built at the start of the 21st century and replaced an older pub with the same name.\n\nThere is a hotel, Roselawn Hotel, formerly a large Victorian farmhouse, located near the bottom of the Reading Road on Burghfield Hill.\n\nBurghfield Common has its own telephone/ADSL exchange, serving 2,891 residential premises, and 91 commercial premises. The exchange also covers the nearby villages of Ufton Nervet, and Sulhamstead. Recently, Talk-Talk unbundled the exchange for use with their up to 24Mbit/s service (ADSL2+). Talk-Talk is currently the only provider to offer this service. No cable services exist in the village.\n\nBurghfield Common and surrounding villages are served by a large water tower located to the Southwestern end of the village, just inside Wokefield Common. There is a small sewage works on Clayhill Brook, between Burghfield village and Trash Green.\n\nThere is a 45MW gas fired combined cycle gas turbine power station at Cottage Lane, Pingewood, known as Burghfield Generation Plant. It was opened in 1998 and is operated by Scottish and Southern Energy Generation Ltd. It required the laying of a 9 km, 200mm-diameter gas pipeline.\n\nThere are a number of Bronze Age sites within the parish – mostly all destroyed by gravel pit workings in Pingewood, for example possible Bronze Age barrows and ditches once sat where the Burghfield sailing club now sails, at , or now sit under the M4 motorway. There was also a barrow cemetery at Field Farm in Pingewood, at , comprising ten round barrows which were visible on aerial photographs along with the cropmarks of a partially visible rectangular enclosure, and parallel ditched boundaries. Four of the barrows were excavated between 1985–88 in advance of gravel extraction and were found to contain primary cremation burials, some of which were urned. Excavations have shown that this site was later used for burials when the Anglo-Saxons moved into the area. In Old English, they named the place 'Hill Field'.\n\nThere have also been numerous finds of Bronze Age spearheads, and an axe head and a sword in the Pingewood and River Kennet area.\n\nOf Iron Age history there is only a ditch and some pits in Burghfield near Amners Farm at .\n\nThere are many indications of Roman settlement in the parish. The first is a possible prehistoric or Roman settlement and field system near the River Kennet, to the west of Burghfield Mill, but now lost to gravel pits. The earthworks were visible from aerial photographs, and formed a system of fragmented conjoined rectilinear enclosures. An incomplete rectangular enclosure, measuring 12m across, could be the remains of a building. The cropmarks extend over an area measuring approximately 700m by 450m. It is possible that some of the cropmarks may relate to much later features, possibly Medieval or Post medieval field boundaries.\n\nOther possible Roman settlements are indicated by cropmarks in the same Pingeword area slightly further to the east and to the south west. Again, some features have been lost to gravel pits.\n\nAgain in Pingewood, at Berrys Lane and Searle's Farm Lane, there are signs of a possible Roman road flanked by possible field systems and/or settlements, which are/were visible as cropmarks on aerial photographs. The side ditches of the road are visible extending in a north easterly direction for 950m. It may be part of the Roman road from Silchester to Verulamium. The settlements or field systems are defined by a series of ditches, sometimes double ditches, which are parallel and perpendicular to the road. There are three concentrations of ditch systems which appear to form fragments of a larger system of conjoined enclosures. These features have been destroyed by gravel extraction.\n\nThere have been finds of Roman coins, pottery, and other artefacts in the region.\n\nAccording to David Nash Ford's Royal Berkshire History: \"Burghfield was a pre-Roman Celtic settlement. are ancient earthworks across the parish, particularly around Pingewood, which preserves the old Celtic word 'pen' meaning head, peak, tip or end. The 'ge' is a contraction of 'coed', Celtic for wood. When the Saxons moved into the area in the 5th century, they did not understand the meaning and added their own descriptive word 'wood' on the end. Burghfield itself is Saxon for 'Hill Field'. The village is built on the slopes of Burghfield Hill, but such a name seems a bit unlikely. It's possible that the prefix is a corruption of an earlier lost Celtic word; or it may refer to a Bronze Age burial barrow rather than a hill.\"\n\nOther references trace the changing name of the village as follows:\n\nBurghfield appears to have been divided from very early times into two equal portions, each containing 1½ hides of land, and this division is probably the origin of the two manors of Burghfield that existed later.\n\nThere is evidence that early Burghfield was divided into two equal portions, or manors, and is referenced twice in the Domesday Book as follows:\n\nThese manors formerly belonging to Queen Emma of Normandy, until her death in 1052. One half of the lands appear to have been transferred to Ralph de Mortemar around 1070, and they remained in that family until the death of Edmund, the last Earl of March in 1425. The heir to the lands was his nephew, a minor, Richard Duke of York, but on his attainder in 1459 the land passed to the crown. The other half of Burghfield was awarded to Henry de Ferrers, a Norman soldier from a noble family who took part in the conquest of England.\n\nAdditionally Sir Nicholas De La Beche (1291–1345) is known to have owned Burghfield at some time. The De La Beche family were powerful landowners and knights in the 14th century. Many of them were retainers to the king, warders to the Tower of London, and Sheriffs of Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The family were influential during the reign of Edward II and Edward III, and were embroiled in the royal intrigue of the time.\n\nThere were two manors in Burghfield; Burghfield Regis, and Burghfield Abbas, although the current Parish of Burghfield now includes for the former manor of Sheffield (or Soefeld). King Edward IV, gave the Burghfield manor its Royal title of 'Regis'. Its manor house, alias Nether Court, stood on the site now occupied by the Rectory in Burghfield village. This manner was sub-tenanted to the family of Thomas de Burghfield, who proudly took his name from the village, sometime before 1175. The De Burghfields were also sub-tenants of Burghfield Abbas, which had been owned by Reading Abbey from about the same time. The original Burghfield Bridge was commissioned by Matthew De Burghfield, being the lord of the latter manor in the early 13th century, but later on the family had arguments with King Edward I over who should repair it. There was a minor skirmish there after the First Battle of Newbury in 1643.\n\nSheffield Manor (originally \"Sewelle\") was located at what is now Sheffield Bottom, at the junction of Jaques's Lane and Station Road. The manor of Sheffield was granted by the Count of Évreux to St Martin-de-Noyon, Charleval, in circa 1086, as an alien Benedictine cell, and was leased privately after 1166-7. Reading Abbey gained possession in 1270. Although known locally as the Priory, it was only a manor and later a grange with a chapel and mill. It is a scheduled ancient monument number 1302719.\n\nThere were originally two mills on the River Kennet attributed to the parish, although slight changes to parish boundaries in modern times means that one mill has been lost.\n\nBurghfield Mill is a dis-used water mill to the west of Burghfield Bridge, now converted to residential apartments. The original mill of Burghfield was split in two equal portions, each attached to one of the Burghfield Manors.\n\nSheffield Manor was served by its own mill further upstream, and now falling within the neighbouring Theale parish. In 1811 the Sheffield mills were paper-mills, but burned down in 1877. The mill was afterwards bought by James Dewe of Burghfield Mill, who thus secured the water rights.\n\nDownstream of Burghfield lies Southecote Mill, within Southecote parish. Upstream from Sheffield lies Tyle Mill, within Sulhamstead parish.\n\nThe Williams family bought all three manors after the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the village was the childhood home of John Williams, 1st Baron Williams of Thame(1500 – 14 October 1559), an important servant of several Tudor monarchs. Upon his death, having no male heirs, the manors of Burghfield were left to his daughter Margery (Margaret Williams of Rycote) and her husband, Sir Henry Norreys. In 1560 Henry and Margery bestowed Burghfield Regis (now Burghfield Manor) and Burghfield Abbas (now Amners Court) to her cousin, Nicholas Williams. Sheffield Manor was retained in the Norreys family.\n\nMoatlands Farm was apparently a moated house. It stood just south of Burghfield Mill, where the gravel pits are now. In the 18th century, it was the home of the May family.\n\nSearle's Farm is an ancient Tudor building marooned in the middle of the gravel pits in northern Burghfield. One particular room in the house is said to be haunted. Apparently an unmarried serving girl, having discovered she was pregnant, committed suicide by throwing herself from the window during the 19th century. Even those who do not know the story will have a strange dream when staying in the room. The young girl appears, in a flowing white dress at the window, staring out over the surrounding countryside. The room is in darkness, but she is illuminated in a soft white light! Several visitors have born witness to this phenomenon; likewise to a similar light which is seen under the door to the same room when, within there, it is pitch black.\n\nThe Old Manor at Whitehouse Green is a small manor house built in 1685 and updated in the 20th Century. It is built of brick with vitreous headers and with an old tile gabled roof and in the initial category of listed building, Grade II.\n\nIn like class is Burghfield Bridge (rebuilt in stone circa 1770).\nSir Gilbert Blane (1749–1834), a Scottish physician who instituted health reform in the Royal Navy, had a country house at Culverlands near Burghfield. The house was enlarged in 1879 and was later occupied by Sir Charles Wyndham Murray MP. It is described as a plain plastered building with a balustraded parapet and slate roofs.\n\nThere is an old well with an Oak framed shelter in Burghfield Common in the corner of a small village green, known locally as \"The Wells\", in Bunces Lane and at the Junction with Springwood Lane. The shelter bears the engraved inscription: \"In memory of Queen Victoria (1819–1901) in the year of the coronation of her son Edward VII 1902\"\n\nIn the early part of World War II, several wartime installations and anti-invasion measures were installed across the parish, including:\n\nMany of the former ROF workers' houses (both wooden and prefabricated single storey buildings) built along the road (\"The Mearings\" - which went past the ROF's Main Gate) were removed and the road became a private one.\n\nGreat Auclum at Burghfield Common was the site of a famous speed hill climb track. First used competitively in 1949, it closed in 1974 and is now a housing estate.\n\nLocated on Burghfield (Reading) Road, Burghfield Common, opposite the village hall.\n\nThe church is located at Abbey Park, Clay Hill, Burghfield Common. During the Second World War, two Douai monks, Fathers Oswald Dorman and Edward Fairhead, celebrated Mass for the hundreds of Irish who came to work in the local munitions 'factories at Burghfield (now the site of AWE Burghfield) and Grazeley Green. After the Second World War, Mass was celebrated at Burghfield in the W.R.N.S. Hostel, Clayhill Road, which later became H.M.S. Dauntless, and then at the old Bland's School on the Reading Road. In 1961, St. Joseph's Church Hall, Clay Hill, Burghfield, was blessed. This incorporated an old army prefab on land purchased by Father Oswald Dorman in the late 1950s. The reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960s encouraged a further spate of church building. At Burghfield in 1973, it was decided to build a new church, dedicated to St. Oswald to commemorate the great labours of Father Oswald Dorman. Designed by Lance Wright of Pangbourne, this church was opened in 1976.\n\nThe Church of England parish church of St Mary in Church Lane, Burghfield village, was originally built in the 12th century, but early in the Victorian era it was completely demolished and replaced by a Norman revival building designed by J.B. Clacy of Reading and completed in 1843. The original church had a stepped wooden tower, and the building is depicted in one of the stained glass windows.\n\nThe parish church contains a number of church monuments from the old St. Mary's, including the alabaster effigy of an important historic figure, Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury the father of Warwick the Kingmaker. He fought for the Yorkist cause during the Wars of the Roses, and was executed after the Battle of Wakefield in 1460. He was buried first at Pontefract, but his son transferred his body to the family mausoleum at Bisham Priory and erected this effigy as part of his monument there. It is not clear why it was brought to Burghfield after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The effigy of a lady alongside him wears a headdress which is not thought to be of the right date to be his wife, but she may be one of the earlier Countesses of Salisbury buried at Bisham.\n\nOther monuments from the old St. Mary's that survive in the 1843 building include a damaged early 14th century effigy of a knight, and two other recumbent stone effigies that have been defaced. There is also a memorial brass to Nicholas Williams (died 1568) and his two wives.\n\nThe church has six bells hung for change ringing:\n\nThe headquarters of the UK Guide Dogs for the Blind (GDFB) association is located in Burghfield Hill at Hillfields House, being the former residence of Mr. H.G. Willink The house is a red and blue brick gabled house with a slate roof, and has been much refurbished and extended to suit the charity's needs following their purchase of the house and grounds in 1992\n\nEducation in the parish is provided by the following schools:\n\nThere are a number of war memorials in the parish, which commemorate the local lives lost in the two great wars:\n\n\nAs well as taking advantage of the numerous public footpaths that criss cross the parish, there are many other sports and leisure amenities in and around Burghfield, these include for: \n\n\n"}

Bass, and as \"Uncle Goopy\" in one of the most celebrated comedy sketches in history, on Sid Caesar's \"Your Show of Shows\" (1954).\n\nMorris was born to a Jewish family in the Bronx, New York, the son of Elsie and Hugo Morris, a rubber company executive. During World War II, Howard was assigned to a United States Army Special Services unit where he was the First Sergeant. Maurice Evans was the company commander and Carl Reiner and Werner Klemperer were soldiers in the unit. Based in Honolulu, the unit entertained American troops throughout the Pacific.\n\nHe came to prominence in appearances on Sid Caesar's \"Your Show of Shows\" (a live sketch comedy series appearing weekly in the United States, from 1950 to 1954). In April 1954, Morris joined Caesar and Carl Reiner in \"This Is Your Story,\" an 11-minute takeoff on Ralph Edwards's \"This Is Your Life\". Morris claimed it was his favorite. As \"The New Yorker\"'s David Margolick wrote in 2014,\n\nMorris also appeared twice in 1957 in episodes of the short-lived NBC comedy/variety show \"The Polly Bergen Show\".\n\nAlthough Morris was a classically trained Shakespearean actor, he is best remembered for playing the wily and over-the-top mountain man character Ernest T. Bass on \"The Andy Griffith Show\". Also, he played George, the TV mechanic in the episode, \"Andy and Helen Have Their Day.\" He had lampooned southern accents while in the army at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He starred in one of the more comical early hour-long \"Twilight Zone\" episodes, \"I Dream of Genie.\" Other roles included that of Elmer Kelp in \"The Nutty Professor\", a movie studio clerk in the short film \"Star Spangled Salesman\", and an art appraiser in an episode of \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\". He also had appeared in several Broadway shows including the highly regarded 1960 revival of \"Finian's Rainbow\" as Og the leprechaun opposite Bobby Howes as Finian. He played the role of Schmidlap in \"Way... Way Out\" and appeared in the movie, \"Boys' Night Out\" (1962) starring Tony Randall, Kim Novak and James Garner.\n\nMorris was first heard in animated cartoons in the early 1960s. He and Allan Melvin teamed up for a 50-episode King Features Syndicate series, \"Beetle Bailey\", for which he and Melvin also wrote a number of episodes. He also provided the voices for Gene Deitch's Academy Award-winning \"Munro\", about a four-year-old boy who was drafted into the Army.\n\nBeginning in 1962, Morris played a variety of voices in many Hanna-Barbera series including \"The Jetsons\" as Jet Screamer who sang the \"Eep opp ork ah ah!\" song, (said to be Morris' first work for Hanna-Barbera) and \"The Flintstones\". He was the original voice of Atom Ant and provided the voice of Mr. Peebles in the \"Magilla Gorilla\" series, teaming up again with Allan Melvin who performed the voice for Magilla. In another series, Morris was heard as the voice of Breezly Bruin which was similar in tone with the Bill Scott vocalization of Bullwinkle. Morris had a disagreement with Joseph Barbera prior to production of the 1966-1967 season of \"Magilla Gorilla\" and \"Atom Ant\" and all of his voices were recast, mostly using Don Messick. Years later the two men reconciled and Morris was back doing those voices and others. He also lent his voice to Forsythe \"Jughead\" Jones on Filmation's series \"The Archies\" from 1968-1977. Moreover, he was the voice of Leonard Blush, \"The Masked Singer\" - he had a skin condition - as well as the regular voice of the Mount Pilot radio station's host on the Andy Griffith Show.\n\nMorris also voiced the characters Professor Icenstein and Luigi La Bounci in the animated series \"Galaxy High\". He voiced Mayor McCheese and later the Hamburglar (taking over for Larry Storch in 1986) in McDonald's McDonaldland ad campaign, which Morris also directed. He is also remembered by Filmation and \"Archie Show\" fans as the voice of Jughead Jones throughout the life of the franchise. Morris provided the voice of Wade Duck in the \"U.S. Acres\" segments of \"Garfield and Friends\", and voiced Webbly in \"Bobby's World\" and Flem in \"Cow & Chicken\". Morris supplied the voice of the koala in TV commercials for Qantas from 1967 through 1992 (saying the tagline, \"I hate Qantas\"), and voiced the character of Gopher in the Disney featurettes \"Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\" and \"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\". Also in 1989 he voiced a French gangster cat named Monte De Zar of Paris, France, (Fat Cat's Cousin) in an episode of Disney's: Chip 'N Dale Rescue Rangers episode \"Le Purrfect Crime\".\n\nWhile Morris continued to make himself available for voice and sound effect roles, he also began a new career in voice directing. Among the projects he directed are \"Police Academy\", \"Richie Rich\", \"Bionic Six\", \"Goin' Coconuts\", \"Pole Position\", \"Galaxy High\", \"The Snorks\", \"The Mighty Orbots\", \"Rose Petal Place\", \"The Dogfather\", \"Dragon's Lair\", \"\", \"Turbo Teen\", \"Cabbage Patch Kids: First Christmas\", \"Little Clowns of Happytown\", \"The Little Wizards\", \"Space Stars\" and \"Kidd Video\".\n\nMorris directed some episodes of \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"Gomer Pyle\", \"Hogan's Heroes\", \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\", the black and white pilot episode of \"Get Smart\" and later, episodes of \"One Day at a Time\", \"Bewitched\", and single episodes of many other comedy shows.\n\nMorris also directed Doris Day in her final film, \"With Six You Get Eggroll\" (1968). Other films he directed were \"Don't Drink the Water\" (1969) and \"Who's Minding the Mint?\" (1967).\n\nMel Brooks occasionally cast Morris in his films. For example, he played Brooks' mentor psychiatrist Dr. Lilloman in the comedy \"High Anxiety\" (1977), the emperor's court spokesman (\"Here, wash this!\") in \"History of the World, Part I\" (1981), and played a bum named Sailor living in the streets in \"Life Stinks\" (1991).\n\nIn 1984, he played Dr. Zidell in \"Splash\", a film directed by Ron Howard (the two had first worked together on \"The Andy Griffith Show\"). He worked with his old friend and trouping partner Sid Caesar as nervous Jewish tailors in the 1998 movie of Ray Bradbury's \"The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit\".\n\nIn 1986, he reprised his famous role as Ernest T. Bass in the high-rated television movie \"Return to Mayberry\". \n\nIn 1989, he guest starred on \"Murder, She Wrote\".\n\nIn 1994, Morris voiced Zinn-a-Zu the Bird, Garfield the Third Fish, the Sneetches and Mr. Fox in \"Storybook Weaver\", and later in 2004, remade as \"Storybook Weaver Deluxe\".\n\nShortly before his death, he played Flem on \"Cow and Chicken\".\n\nMorris was married six times. He was first married to Mary Helen McGowan from 1945 to 1962. He married his second wife Dolores A. Wylie later in 1962; the marriage lasted until 1977 when they divorced. Throughout his marriages, he had three daughters and a son, along with three grandchildren.\n\nOn May 21, 2005, Morris died of congestive heart failure. At his funeral, the \"Uncle Goopy\" sketch was shown; among the eulogizers were Carl Reiner, who praised Morris's ability to improvise. He is entombed in Laurel Gardens Wall crypt at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118467", "title": "BS 7671", "text": "BS 7671\n\nBritish Standard BS 7671 \"Requirements for Electrical Installations. IET Wiring Regulations\", informally called in the electrical community The \"Regs\", is the national standard in the United Kingdom for electrical installation and the safety of electrical wiring in domestic, commercial, industrial, and other buildings, also in special installations and locations, such as marinas or caravan parks and medical locations\n\nIn general, BS 7671 applies to circuits supplied at nominal voltages (Uo) up to and including 1000 volts AC or 1500 volts DC. The standard therefore covers the Extra Low Voltage range (ELV) range up to and including \n50 volt AC and 125 volt DC and the low voltage (LV) range which is above 50 volt AC and 125 volt DC Up to and including the threshold of High voltage 1000 volt AC and 1500 volt DC, the frequencies covered are 50 60 and 400 Hz AC mains supply used in the UK for houses, offices, and commerce. It did not become a recognized British Standard until the publication of the 16th edition in 1992. The standard takes account of the technical substance of agreements reached in CENELEC.\n\nThe current version is BS 7671:2018 (the 18th Edition) issued in 2018 and came into effect from 1 January 2019. Amendment 1 to the 18th Edition was published in February 2020 but the only changes were to section 722 (Electric Vehicle Charging Installations). These changes came into immediate effect upon publication release, unlike previous amendments where 6 months elapsed before changes became compliant. BS 7671 is also used as a national standard by Mauritius, St Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Cyprus, and several other countries, which base their wiring regulations on BS 7671.\n\nThe standard is maintained by the Joint IET/BSI Technical Committee JPEL/64, the UK National Committee for Wiring Regulations, and published by the IET (formerly IEE). Although the IET and BSI are non-governmental organisations and the Wiring Regulations are non-statutory, they are referenced in several UK statutory instruments, and in most cases, for practical purposes, have legal force as the appropriate method of electric wiring.\n\nThe BSI (British Standards Institute) publishes numerous titles concerning acceptable standards of design/safety/quality across different fields.\n\nThe first edition was published in 1882 as the \"Rules and Regulations for the Prevention of Fire Risks arising from Electric Lighting.\" The title became \"General Rules recommended for Wiring for the Supply of Electrical Energy\" with the third edition in 1897, \"Wiring Rules\" with the fifth edition of 1907, and settled at \"Regulations for the Electrical Equipment of Buildings\" with the eighth edition in 1924.\n\nSince the 15th edition (1981), these regulations have closely followed the corresponding international standard IEC 60364. In 1992, the IEE Wiring Regulations became British Standard BS 7671 so that the legal enforcement of their requirements was easier both with regard to the Electricity at Work regulations and from an international point of view. They are now treated similar to other British Standards. BS 7671 has converged towards (and is largely based on) the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) harmonisation documents, and therefore is technically very similar to the current wiring regulations of other European countries.\n\n\"Rules and Regulations for the Prevention of Fire Risks arising from Electric Lighting.\" - Two core cable, line and neutral, no earth. The protection was a re-wirable fuse.\n\nThe 17th edition, released in January 2008 and amended in 2011 (\"Amendment 1\"), 2013 (\"Amendment 2\") and January 2015 (\"Amendment 3\") became effective for all installations designed after 1 July 2008. One of the more significant changes is (chapter 41) that 30 mA RCDs will be required for socket outlets that are for use by ordinary persons and are intended for general use. This improves the level of protection against electrical shock in the UK to a level comparable to that in other EU countries. The 17th edition and its amendments incorporated new sections relating to microgeneration and solar photovoltaic systems, non-combustible consumer units, RCDs, and breakers (including high resilience breaker layout).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118475", "title": "Gerald Murnane", "text": "Gerald Murnane\n\nGerald Murnane (born 25 February 1939) is an Australian writer, perhaps best known for his novel \"The Plains\" (1982). \"The New York Times\", in a big feature published on 27 March 2018, called him \"the greatest living English-language writer most people have never heard of\".\n\nMurnane was born in Coburg, Victoria, a suburb of Melbourne, and has almost never left the state of Victoria. He is one of four children–one of whom, a brother, suffered an intellectual disability, was repeatedly hospitalised and died in 1985. Parts of his childhood were spent in Bendigo and the Western District. In 1956 he graduated from De La Salle College, Malvern.\n\nMurnane briefly trained for the Roman Catholic priesthood in 1957. He abandoned this path, however, instead becoming a teacher in primary schools (from 1960 to 1968), and at the Victoria Racing Club's Apprentice Jockeys' School. He received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Melbourne in 1969, then worked in the Victorian Education Department until 1973. From 1980 he began to teach creative writing at various tertiary institutions.\n\nIn 1969 Murnane moved to the Melbourne suburb of Macleod. After the death of his wife in 2009 Murnane moved to Goroke in country Victoria.\n\nHe married in 1966 and has three sons.\n\nMurnane's first two books, \"Tamarisk Row\" (1974) and \"A Lifetime on Clouds\" (1976), seem to be semi-autobiographical accounts of his childhood and adolescence. Both are composed largely of very long but grammatical sentences.\n\nIn 1982, he attained his mature style with \"The Plains\", a short novel about an unnamed filmmaker who travels to \"inner Australia\", where he endeavours to film the plains under the patronage of wealthy landowners. The novel has been termed a fable, parable or allegory. The novel is both a metaphysical parable about appearance and reality, and a parodic examination of traditions and cultural horizons. It has been suggested that the book's opening has the narrator expressing an outlook that is typical to Murnane's writing:Twenty years ago, when I first arrived on the plains, I kept my eyes open. I looked for anything in the landscape that seemed to hint at some elaborate meaning behind appearances.My journey to the plains was much less arduous than I afterwards described it. And I cannot even say that at a certain hour I knew I had left Australia. But I recall clearly a succession of days when the flat land around me seemed more and more a place that only I could interpret.\"The Plains\" was followed by: \"Landscape With Landscape\" (1985), \"Inland\" (1988), \"Velvet Waters\" (1990), and \"Emerald Blue\" (1995). A book of essays, \"Invisible Yet Enduring Lilacs\", appeared in 2005. These books are all concerned with the relation between memory, image, and landscape, and frequently with the relation between fiction and non-fiction.\n\n2009 saw the release of Murnane's first work of fiction in over a decade, \"Barley Patch\", which was followed by \"A History of Books\" in 2012 and \"A Million Windows\" in 2014. Will Heyward, in a review of \"A Million Windows\" for Music & Literature, suggests that these three latter works may be seen as a single, continuous project, containing \"a form of fiction defined by a fragmentary style that avoids plot and characterization, and is instead narrated by association and the fugue-like repetition and variation of images.\"\n\nIn June 2018, his 2017 autobiographical novel \"Border Districts\" was shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Award.\n\nAlthough Murnane is primarily known within Australia, he does have a following in other countries, especially the US, Sweden and Germany. In July/August 2017, \"The Plains\" was the number 1 book recommendation of South West German Radio (SWR2). His works have been translated into Italian (\"Velvet Waters\" as \"Una Melodia\"), German (\"The Plains\" as \"Die Ebenen\", publ. Suhrkamp Verlag) and Swedish (\"Inland\" as \"Inlandet\", \"The Plains\" as \"Slätterna\", \"Velvet Waters\" as \"Sammetsvatten\" and \"Barley Patch\" as \"Korntäppa\").\n\n\"Tamarisk Row\" and \"Border Districts\" were published in the UK by And Other Stories in 2019.\n\nMurnane is an avid follower of horse racing, which often serves as a metaphor in his work. A documentary, \"Words and Silk – The Real and Imaginary Worlds of Gerald Murnane\" (1989), directed by Philip Tyndall, examined Murnane's childhood, work, approach to the craft of writing, and interest in horse-racing. Since his retirement to Goroke, Murnane has played golf at the Goroke Golf Course.\n\nHe taught himself Hungarian after having read Gyula Illyés' \"People of the Puszta\", as described in the essay \"The Angel's Son: Why I Learned Hungarian Late in Life\":I have read several times during my life that this or that person was so impressed by this or that translation of this or that work of literature that the person afterwards learned the original language in order to read the original text. I have always been suspicious of this sort of claim, but, the reader of this piece of writing need not doubt the truth of the following sentence. I was so impressed by the English version of \"Puszták népe\" that I afterwards learned the language of the original and, as of now, have read a goodly part of it.\n\nIn June 2018 Murnane released a spoken word album, \"Words in Order\". The centrepiece is a 1600-word palindrome written by Murnane, which he recites over a minimalist musical score. He also performs works by Thomas Hardy, Dezső Kosztolányi, DEVO and Killdozer.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118476", "title": "Bergensk", "text": "Bergensk\n\nBergensk or Bergen dialect is a dialect of Norwegian used in Bergen, Norway. It is easy for Norwegians to recognise, as it is more distinguishable from other dialects in Hordaland than, for example, the Stavanger dialect (\"Stavangersk\") from the dialects of Rogaland, and the Trondheim dialect from Trøndelag dialects.\n\nProto-Germanic, the common ancestor of all Germanic languages, in the 1st millennium AD evolved into Proto-Norse and later Old Norse. This subsequently developed into Western Norse and finally Old Norwegian about 1300. From 1350 to 1525, Norwegian went through a Middle Norwegian transition toward Modern Norwegian, partly fuelled by the devastating effect the Black Death had on Norway.\n\nMany Low German and German words found their way to Norwegian through the Bergen dialect, which makes up almost 35% of the basic Norwegian vocabulary. The long history of multi-lingual coexistence in Bergen has made the dialect more susceptible to simplifications, in order to ease communication, and the influence of Danish and Low German are apparent in the modern Bergen dialect's phonetics.\n\nBergen's strong foreign influence, such as Hanseatic League merchants in the period from about 1350 to 1750, had a profound effect on the Bergen dialect. The Hanseatic merchants spoke varieties of Low German, and perhaps a pidgin in dealings with the locals. Bergen was the only major Norwegian city during the Dano-Norwegian union from 1536 to 1814, and the Bergen dialect absorbed more of language trends from abroad, such as from Danish, than other Norwegian dialects. The written standard of the time, was based on a Copenhagen variety of the Danish language, and it continued to affect \"Bergensk\" well into the 20th century. A Dano-Norwegian koiné, resembling the non-standard Riksmål, is still spoken, although in recent decades has become much more similar to Bokmål.\n\n\"Bergensk\" is one of two dialects in Norway with only two grammatical genders, the other being the dialect spoken in Lyngen. All others have three (excepting sociolects in other Norwegian urban areas). The feminine gender disappeared in the 16th century. One theory is that this was partly fueled by an influence from Danish, which became the written language and already had abolished the distinction between masculine and feminine forms, and as a simplification to ease communication between Norwegians and Germans or between people from Bergen and other parts of Norway.\n\nThe Old Norse -n ending was retained in the Bergen (Old Norse \"hon\" > \"hon\"), but lost elsewhere (\"hon\" > \"ho\"). The \"-nn\" ending was simplified to \"-n\" everywhere. Since the feminine definite articles were \"-in\" and \"-an\" in Old Norse, while the masculine ending was \"-inn\", another theory is that the retention of -n, combined with an earlier reduction of unstressed vowels, caused the masculine and feminine genders to merge. In other dialects, \"-in\" and \"-an\" lost the final \"-n\", underwent nasalization and developed into \"-a\" in a majority of the modern Norwegian dialects (other variants include \"-e\", \"-i\" and \"-o\") whereas \"-inn\" developed into \"-en\".\n\nIn Norwegian, common nouns may be indefinite or definite, while proper nouns are always indefinite. In the Bergen dialect, however, proper nouns of persons' given names are often definite, giving a less formal tone. For example, Kåre Willoch may be called \"Kåren\" (or \"Kåre'n\", no written convention exists) or \"Willochen\" in \"Bergensk\", whereas this would be considered incorrect elsewhere in Norway, excepting only some rural dialects in the proximity of Bergen. The reason for this emerging in Bergen is thought to be that titles, which are common nouns, were more or less used the same way as names, since in Bergen, formerly Norway's megapolis, there were many people with the same given names, but a wide range of titles. For example, \"Alexander Skomaker\" (in English \"Alexander Shoemaker\"). As titles gradually were perceived as names, \"and\" could be in the definite form (as they were common nouns), after some time, by assimilation to the titles as names, surnames and eventually given names were also used in the definite form.\n\nThe phoneme is realized uvularly, either as a trill or a fricative . The latter is the normal French pronunciation. It probably spread to Bergen (and Kristiansand) some time in the 18th century, overtaking the alveolar trill in the time span of about 2-3 generations. Until recent decades' developments in neighboring rural dialects, this was an easy way of distinguishing them from the Bergen dialect. Nowadays, the uvular is a feature of a much larger area of the southwestern Norway than Bergen. Broader speakers may realize the coda as a central vowel , but that is stigmatized.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, the literacy rate improved, which gave a strong influence from Riksmål, and later Bokmål. Nynorsk, Norway's other written language, was considered rural and thus lacking prestige, and has not had a strong influence on the dialect. Subsequently, large parts of the German-inspired vocabulary unique for Bergen disappeared. Plural endings are used less frequently, for example \"huser\" (houses) has become \"hus\", which is correct Bokmål. Also, pronunciations have shifted slightly towards standard East Norwegian (\"Standard Østnorsk\"), probably as a result of the shift of power towards Oslo. For example, \"pære\" (\"pear\"), which was formerly pronounced as \"péræ\", is now pronounced \"pæræ\".\n\nLike almost all Norwegian dialects, \"Bergensk\" cannot be said to be either Bokmål or Nynorsk. While the vocabulary shows traits of both Bokmål and Nynorsk, it has characteristics that are not covered by any of these written standards. Also, Bokmål is often associated with Eastern Norwegian \"Standard Østnorsk\" pronunciation—although no official affiliation exists. This gives the claim that oral \"Bergensk\" \"is\" partly Bokmål ambiguities.\nAlthough Nynorsk (Neo-Norwegian) has its stronghold in western Norway and the areas surrounding Bergen, most of the inhabitants of Bergen itself write Bokmål.\n\nWhen English verbs are used as substitute for Norwegian verbs, in the past tense they are given an \"-et\" ending, like \"walket\" and \"drivet\". This is different from the other Norwegian dialects, most of which use an \"-a\" ending.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He performs Indian and Western music, including for Hindi movies. His most notable instrument is the piano. He has been credited as \"the first musician to have played the santoor & Indian classical music on the piano\". A review in the US-based \"Keyboard\" magazine described him as the fastest keyboard player in the world and called him the keyboard discovery of the nineties. In 2016 he became an Indian citizen. He was awarded the Padma Shri on 26 January 2020. \n\nHe was born in Lahore to Arshad Sami Khan, a Pakistani Air Force veteran and diplomat of Pashtun origin, and Naureen, who was originally from Jammu and Kashmir state. \"The Times of India\" has called him the \"Sultan of Music\".\n\nAdnan Sami was born in 1971 in Lahore. He was raised and educated in the United Kingdom partially. His father, Arshad Sami Khan, was a Pashtun while his mother Naureen Khan was from Jammu. Adnan's father served as a Pakistan Air Force pilot, before becoming a senior bureaucrat and serving as Pakistan's ambassador to 14 countries. His paternal great-grandfather, General Ahmed Jan, was from Afghanistan and a military advisor to king Abdur Rahman Khan. His paternal grandfather Agha Mehfooz Jan was the governor of four Afghan provinces under King Amanullah Khan's reign and was also the King's first cousin. He was assassinated by Habibullah Kalakani and therefore his father's family migrated to Peshawar, then in British India.\n\nSami attended Rugby School in Rugby, West Midlands, UK. Adnan followed his bachelor's degree with a law degree (LLB) from King's College London. He went on to qualify as a barrister from Lincoln's Inn, England.\n\nHe had played the piano since the age of five and composed his first piece of music when he was nine years old. Sami began taking lessons in Indian classical music from the santoor maestro Pandit Shivkumar Sharma when visiting India during his school vacations. Indian singer Asha Bhosle saw him at age ten at an R. D. Burman concert in London, and encouraged him to take up music as a career. He is an accomplished concert pianist, music composer and singer with a command of Indian and Western classical/semi-classical music, jazz, rock and pop music. As a teenager, Adnan, when performing on the piano on a TV program in Stockholm, was described by the US-based \"Keyboard\" magazine as the fastest man on keyboard in the world and the keyboard discovery of the nineties. Sami went on to learn Indian classical music from Pandit Shivkumar Sharma, the Santoor maestro in India. At the age of sixteen, Sami was approached to write a song for famine-hit Ethiopia, for which he won a special award from UNICEF.\n\nIn his career of 32 years, Sami has won many international awards including the Nigar Award, Bolan Academy Award and Graduate Award. Adnan is the youngest recipient of the Naushad Music Award for Excellence in Music. Previous recipients of this award include Lata Mangeshkar and Music Maestro Khayam. Sami was invited as a member of the jury of the music festival Voice of Asia competition held annually at Almaty, Kazakhstan.\n\nHis first single, \"Run for His Life\", was released in 1986. It was in English, and recorded for UNICEF. It went to No. 1 in the music charts in the Middle East. This was followed by three more No. 1s: \"Talk to Me\", \"Hot Summer Day\" and \"You're My Best Kept Secret\".\n\nHis first formal album, \"The One & Only\" (1989), was a classical album on the piano accompanied by tabla maestro Zakir Hussain. He released his first vocal solo album \"Raag Time\" in 1991. The song from his album \"Teri Yaad\" was the title track of his first album, which became a huge hit in Pakistan.\n\nIn 1994, he composed music for a film for the first time. The 1995 Pakistani film \"Sargam\", in which he was the lead actor and Indian playback singer Asha Bhosle did the playback \"Sargam\", was a box office success. It was also the first time that an Indian playback singer was featured in an album in Pakistan. To date \"Sargam\" is the only film Sami has acted in, and the score is the best-selling album of all time in Pakistan.\n\nIn 2000, Asha Bhosle collaborated with Sami on a collection of love songs named \"Kabhi to Nazar Milao\" in India. The music was also composed by Adnan. The album became an instant success and topped the Indipop charts for most of 2001 and 2002. According to \"Business Week\" magazine, the album sold 4 million copies in India alone.\n\nTwo songs from the album \"Kabhi To Nazar Milao\", whose music video featured model Aditi Gowitrikar, and \"Lift Karaa De\", whose music video starred the popular Indian actor Govinda became popular at that time. The videos were shot by Anil Mehta, who had shot popular Hindi films like \"Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam\" and \"Lagaan\". Because of the album's success, Magnasound and Sami released an album named \"Always Yours\" which was a remix version of numbers from that album.\n\nHe soon became popular, which led Hindi filmmaker Boney Kapoor to invite him to provide music for his film. This was the beginning for him to compose and sing for Hindi films and for the top Hindi film producers of the time like Yash Chopra and Subhash Ghai. Due to the popularity of his music videos and live performances, he started getting acting offers at the same time.\n\nThe song \"Tu Sirf Mera Mehboob\" from the Hindi film \"Ajnabee\", sung by Adnan, became popular and was declared a \"superhit\" by \"Screen Magazine\", who called him the pop personality of the year in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Pepsi Foods made Sami its brand ambassador in India, a contract which involved hosting a series of live music concerts across cities as well as featuring in ads for Pepsi products. He is the only artist in all of Asia and Europe to have endorsed Pepsi Cola and Coca-Cola together.\n\nAccording to the Pakistani newspaper \"Dawn\", no Pakistani artist has ever managed to gain as much popularity in India as Sami has. According to an article in \"The Times of India\", Sami is the \"most successful face in non-film music in India\".\n\nHis second studio album, \"Tera Chehra\", was released in October 2002 to critical acclaim. The music videos for this album were shot by Binod Pradhan, who had shot the popular 2002 Hindi film \"Devdas\". The album features Bollywood stars Rani Mukerji in the title track and Amitabh Bachchan in the track \"Kabhi Nahi\", who also sang the duet with Sami. Actress Mahima Chaudhry was also seen in another song. The title track was written by well-known Hindi movie lyricist Sameer. According to \"Screen Magazine\", it was the only successful pop album of the year. Sami's \"Tera Chehra\" broke sales records by becoming India's best-selling album of 2002 (including film soundtracks), continuing its No. 1 position in 2003, and by becoming the best-selling Indian album of all time (including film soundtracks) in the U.S. and Canada. The album stayed in the No. 1 position in all the music charts of India from the time of its release in September 2002 for over a year, beating his debut album's No. 1 record.\n\n\"Saathiya\" (2002) brought him the opportunity to work with A. R. Rahman in the form of \"Aye Udi Udi\". According to \"Screen Magazine\", the song was \"the highlight of the album\". Rediff.com called him the \"Reigning King of Indipop\" in early 2003 based on the sales of his albums in the previous two years.\n\nHis most successful albums have been \"Kabhi To Nazar Milao\" (with Asha Bhosle) and \"Tera Chehra\", and his music videos usually have had Bollywood stars in them, including Namrata Shirodkar (\"Bheegi Bheegi Raat\"), Mahima Chaudhry, Raveena Tandon, Rani Mukerji (\"Tera Chehra\"), Govinda, Fardeen Khan, Amisha Patel (\"O Meri Jaan\"), Bhumika Chawla (\"Maahiya\"), Dia Mirza (\"Pal Do Pal\") and Amitabh Bachchan (Kabhi Nahi).\n\nSince 2003, he has sung for a few Tamil movies like \"Boys\", \"Aaytha Ezhuthu\" composed by A. R. Rahman. The songs, \"Boom Boom\" from \"Boys\" and \"Nenjamellam Kadhal\" from \"Aayitha Ezhuthu\", were hits. He also sang for the Tamil and Telugu versions besides the Hindi version of songs from the movie \"Yuva\" (2004), whose music was also composed by A. R. Rahman. Besides Rahman, he has also worked with composer Yuvan Shankar Raja, and sang the Tamil songs \"Oh Intha Kadhal\" from \"Satham Podathey\" and \"OruKal\" from \"Siva Manasula Sakthi\". He sang the song \"Chanchadi Adi Urang Nee\" in the Malayalam movie \"Makalkku\". He has also sung for a Kannada film. His first Kannada song was \"Don't Worry Madabeda\" for the film \"Super Star\" starring Upendra. He has also worked with music composers Devi Sri Prasad and M. M. Keeravani and sang songs in Telugu films \"Varsham\", \"Chatrapathi\", \"Shankar Dada MBBS\" and \"100% Love\".\n\nIn 2005, he suffered from lymphoedema and developed an abscess in the knee, which interrupted his career.\n\nIn 2006, he took a sabbatical and reportedly lost over 160 kg. He came back in April 2007 with the album \"Kisi Din\". In 2007, he sang the soundtrack \"Dil Kya Kare\" from the Hindi film \"\" and \"Noor-e-Khuda\" from \"My Name Is Khan\". He was also one of the guest judges on the Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2007.\n\nHe has composed film music for several other Hindi films, including \"\", \"Yeh Raaste Hain Pyar Ke\", \"Dhamaal\", \"1920\", \"Chance Pe Dance\", \"Mumbai Salsa\", \"Khubsoorat\", \"Sadiyaan\", \"Shaurya\" and several others.\n\nAs a classical concert pianist, Sami has given solo performances before royalty such as the King of Sweden and King Hussein of Jordan. He has performed before heads of state and governments such as President Mitterrand of France, the President of the United Arab Emirates, the President and Prime Minister of India, the President and Prime Minister of Pakistan, the President and Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, the Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan, the Prime Minister of Sweden and Princess Christina of Sweden. Adnan has performed for music festivals to sold-out stadiums of his solo concert tours all over the world in over forty countries.\nSami wrote a song for India during the 2003 Cricket World Cup. The video of this song captures the nationalistic spirit of competition, depicting Adnan performing with the Indian cricket team with guest appearances from Indian film stars like Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Fardeen Khan and Kareena Kapoor.\n\nHis work has associated him with prominent people from the Indian film and music industry.\n\nOn 15 December 2002, BBC World Service celebrated 70 years of broadcasting by organizing a worldwide live concert with artists representing different parts of the world who performed before a global audience via satellite. Sami was chosen to represent India.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, Sami became the only musical artist from the entire Asian region to have sold out Wembley Stadium in London for two nights in a row; this was recorded in the Limca Book of World Records (Asia's equivalent to the West's \"Guinness Book of World Records\"). He did this again in 2005, 2008, and 2012.\n\nIn 2010, Sami received the \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" from the Prime Minister of Pakistan at a ceremony by Pakistan Television.\n\nIn 2011, Sami was given the \"Glory of India Award\" by the India International Friendship Society. This was the 350th anniversary of the completion of the Taj Mahal, and Sami gave a solo concert performance in front of the Taj Mahal on the final night of the celebrations. After this performance, the Indian media dubbed him the \"Sultan of Music\".\n\nHe hosted the Indian version of the American music game show \"Don't Forget the Lyrics!\" called \"Bol Baby Bol\" on the Star TV network in 2008. Prior to that in 2005, he was the sole jury for the singing competition program on Channel [V] called \"Super Singer\".

They divorced after three years.\n\nSami began living in India since 13 March 2001, on a visitor's visa which was extended from time to time.\n\nIn 2001, Sami married Dubai-based Arab Sabah Galadari. This was his second marriage and Sabah's second marriage as well; she had a son from her previous marriage. This relationship also ended in divorce, a year-and-a-half later.\n\nIn June 2006, he weighed 230 kilograms (506 lb); he claimed his doctor had given him just six months to live. By diet and exercise, he lost in 16 months.\n\nIn 2008, his wife Sabah returned to Mumbai, remarried him and began living with him, but the marriage only lasted one year, after which Sabah filed for divorce again.\n\nIn 2009, his father died of pancreatic cancer, which he described as the \"biggest blow\" of his life, saying that he had been extremely close to his father.\n\nOn 29 January 2010 Sami married Roya Sami Khan, the daughter of a retired diplomat and army general. He first met Roya in India during her visit in 2010 and proposed to her after some time. On 10 May 2017, he became a father to a daughter, Medina Sami Khan.\n\nOn 26 May 2015, he submitted a request for Indian citizenship to the Ministry of Home Affairs, when his Pakistani passport expired , he had lived adequate amount of years in India that made him eligible for Indian citizenship hence he naturalised as an Indian citizen. In late December 2015, the Indian Home Ministry approved his request for legal status as a citizen of India, effective as of 1 January 2016.\n\n\n\"Badaltay Mausam\" (1997) was re-released in India as \"Kabhi To Nazar Milao\" (2000).\n\nSami has won a number of international awards, including the Nigar Award, the Bolan Academy Award, and the Graduate Award. He was given a special award by UNICEF for the song he wrote for famine-hit Ethiopia as a teenager and a United Nations Peace Medal for a song he wrote and performed for Africa.\n\nA review of his piano solo performance on British TV Channel 4 in \"Keyboard\" magazine called him the \"Keyboard Discovery of the 90s\".\n\nIn 2001, he was awarded the Breakthrough Artist of the Year by MTV.\n\nSwedish and British radio and television have often referred to him as the fastest keyboard player in the world. Adnan has performed for prestigious music festivals to sold-out stadiums of his solo concert tours all over the world in over forty countries. In summer 2003, he became the only Asian artist to have sold out Wembley Stadium, London, for two consecutive nights, which won him a place in the Limca Book of Records.\n\nAs a classical concert pianist, Sami has given performances before the King of Sweden and King Hussein of Jordan.\n\nIn 2007, Sami was given a Special Award from the U.K. Parliament (House of Commons) for his 'Outstanding Contribution to Sub-Continental Music'.\n\nIn 2008, he was presented the \"Naushad Music Award\" by Andhra Pradesh Department of Culture, in Hyderabad.\n\nIn 2008 he also won \"Best International Act\" at the UK Asian Music Awards.\n\nIn 2013, he was given the BrandLaureate International Brand Personality award by the President of The BrandLaureate, Dr KK Johan, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nLater in 2013, Sami was given a Special Award by the Canadian Parliament for his 'Exceptional Services to Indian Music'.\n\nIn April 2017, Sami became the first South Asian to have performed at London's Wembley Stadium 8 times; tickets were sold out on all 8 occasions.

The word \"Moribana\" means \"piled up flowers\".\n\nThis style was introduced by Unshin Ohara around 1890 after the Meiji Restoration of 1868. \"Moribana\" is not only an expression of Unshin Ohara’s creative departure from \"Ikenobo\", but was also a strong sign of the Western influence in Japan. The arranged flowers may be placed in Western-style rooms and entranceways, not just in the \"tokonoma\" alcove found in traditional Japanese-style rooms. While distinctly a hallmark of the Ohara school, \"moribana\" has become one of the standard forms learned and created by \"Ikebana\" practitioners regardless of school or style affiliation.\n\n\"Moribana\" is often associated with \"nageire\", and although the two styles share similarities, their historic development is different, \"nageire\" being older.\n\n\"Moribana\" uses one or more clusters of arrangements in \"kenzan\", a holder with many sharp points into which flowers are inserted, or \"shippo\" that has holes, to replicate how water plants grow and how creatures move around in natural ponds. The main feature of \"moribana\" is the broad expanse of natural-looking shapes and a mound of beautiful flowers. Choice of materials and how much water shows in front, side, or back reflects the passing of the season. For example, more water is placed to the front during Spring and Summer.\n\nA proper \"Moribana\" design uses a flat, shallow container, sometimes referred to as \"suiban\", which allows for the spreading of floral and line materials sideways and away from the earlier classic vertical lines of the \"rikka\", \"seika\" and even \"nageirebana\".\n\nThere are different styles of \"moribana\" depending on the length and angle of the primary, secondary, and ornamental stems. \n\n\nThe primary stem is placed vertically, while the secondary stem is tilted 45 degrees and scattered over a 30-degree area to the front and left. The ornamental stem is tilted 60 degrees and placed across a 45-degree area to the front and right. Seen from above, the three stems form a right triangle. Flowers are placed inside this triangle to fill out the shape.\n\n\n\nSmall pebbles may be used to cover the bottom of the container and create a more natural look of the arrangement.\n\n"}
{"id": "2118483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118483", "title": "John Wallop", "text": "John Wallop\n\nSir John Wallop (c. 1490 – 13 July 1551) was an English soldier and diplomat who belonged to an old Hampshire family from the village of Farleigh Wallop.\n\nWallop, was son of Stephen Wallop by the daughter of Hugh Ashley.\n\nWallop may have taken part in Sir Edward Poynings's expedition to the Low Countries in 1511 and may have been knighted there. He certainly was knighted before 1513, when he accompanied Sir Edward Howard on his unfortunate but glorious journey to Brest. In July 1513 he was captain of the \"Sancho de Gara\", a hired ship, and in May 1514 he was captain of the \"Gret Barbara\". In these years he did a great deal of damage to French shipping. On 12 August 1515, he was sent with letters for Margaret, Duchess of Savoy, regent of the Netherlands.\n\nIn 1516 he left England on a more honourable errand. Armed with a letter from Henry VIII, dated 14 September 1516, to Emmanuel I, king of Portugal, he sailed to that country and offered his services at his own expense against the Moors. He remained fighting at or near Tangier, and then came back to England having been made a knight of the order of Christ. In September 1518 his name occurs as one of the king's pensioners, and for the next three years he was serving under Earl of Surrey in Ireland, frequently being the means of communication between the Lord Deputy and Henry VIII. Wallop took a prominent part in the fighting in France in 1522 and 1523. Doubtless as a reward he was on 31 March 1524 appointed high marshal of Calais.\n\nIn September 1526 Wallop was sent on an embassy. He first went to Margaret, Duchess of Savoy, then to the Archduke, reaching Cologne on 30 September. He remained there till well on in November, writing to Cardinal Wolsey as to the progress of the . On 30 November he was back in Brussels with Hacket, thence he returned again early in December to Cologne, and went on to Mainz. On 12 January 1527 he was at Augsburg. On 1 February he was at Prague, and saw the entry of Ferdinand, king of the Romans. It was doubtless at this time that he received the two great gilt cups that he mentions in his will as having been given him by Ferdinand. On 26 April he was at Olmütz. On 20 May he was at Breslau in Silesia, visiting Sigismund I, King of Poland, who made vague but pleasant promises of hostility against \"the ungraciose sect of Lutere\". King Ferdinand would not let him go to Hungary, where he wished to communicate with the waiwode. On 11 July he was at Vienna, and probably returned to England in the autumn.\n\nWallop seems to have paid a hasty visit to Paris in January 1528. On 29 January 1528 he received an annuity of fifty marks. About 17 February he left England on a formal embassy to France, and wrote from Poissy on 29 February that he had seen Francis and congratulated him on his recovery from illness. On 2 April 1528 he was at St. Maur \"sore vexed with the coughe and murre\". He was made, with Richard Paget, surveyor of the subsidies on kerseys on 17 March 1528 at a joint salary of £100. He remained in Paris for some time, but was at Calais on 2 June.\n\nWallop rapidly received valuable rewards for his services. He had long been a gentleman of the privy chamber. On 1 March 1522 he had received the constableship of Trim in Ireland, but had surrendered it before 1524. On 6 April 1529 he became keeper of the lordship and park of Dytton, Buckinghamshire. On 23 June 1530 he received a formal grant of the lieutenancy of Calais as \"from 6 October last\". This was a promotion, as the lieutenant of Calais who commanded the citadel was next in rank to the deputy. He was at Calais during the great repairs of 1531.\n\nIn April 1532 Wallop was sent as ambassador to Paris, which he visited at frequent intervals as the English resident for the next eight or nine years. He went into the south of France with Gardiner and Bryan in 1533, and was at Marseilles on 5 October at the meeting of Francis and the pope. The Venetian Marin Giustinian, writing from Paris on 15 April 1533, spoke of Wallop as one who did not approve of the divorce. He was probably in London in the middle of 1534, but was certainly back in Paris in December, and remained there for the first half of 1535, taking part in the attempt to persuade Melanchthon to come to England. In October he was at Dijon, and remained for some time in the south. He was at Lyons from the beginning of 1536 until June. In July there was a rumour that he was going to Spain. A curious letter to him from Henry, dated 12 September 1536, directs him to investigate the strength of the French fortresses. On 2 October 1536 he was at Valence, but back in Paris in December. He left Paris on 1 March 1537, and was in London in May.\n\nWallop was now rich, as his uncle had been some time dead. In 1538 he was granted the lands of the dissolved monastery of Barlinch, Somerset, and some manors in Somerset and Devonshire. In May 1539 he was in the Pale of Calais, where there were troubles as to religion.\n\nIn February 1540 Wallop succeeded Bonner as ambassador resident at Paris; at Abbeville he was presented to the king of France and had an interview with the queen of Navarre. He had reached Paris by June 1540, and was soon joined there by Carne. For the rest of this year he followed the court, sometimes going as far as Rouen or Caudebec.\n\nWilliam, lord Sandys of the Vyne, captain of Guisnes, died on 4 December 1540, and Wallop's friends made a successful application in his favour. It is strange that the captaincy of Guisnes should have been considered a more advantageous post than that which he already held, particularly as we know that Francis liked him. Chapuys, indeed, says that many thought he had been retired for fear he should withdraw himself. On 18 January 1541 he was revoked in favour of Lord William Howard. Suddenly he fell into disgrace. He was accused of \"sundry notable offences and treasons done towards us\", but in consideration of his long service he was allowed to explain his conduct. Brought before the council (some time earlier than 26 March 1541),\nQueen Catherine Howard, it seems, had made intercession, and Henry himself, who was fond of men of Wallop's type, would not need much persuading. Thus he became captain of Guisnes in March 1541.\n\nAt Guisnes he remained, no doubt taking an active part in the engineering operations in the Pale of this time, and attending the meetings of the deputy's council, of which, as captain of Guisnes, he was a member. In 1543, when Henry and Charles were in alliance and an English force was ordered to co-operate with the imperialists in the north of France, the Earl of Surrey supposed he should have the command; but, to his disappointment, it was given to Wallop, with Sir Thomas Seymour as his marshal; Surrey had to accept a subordinate post. The expedition effected little, though the soldiers were long in the field. Wallop was ill during part of the operations, but gained great glory, and Emperor Charles V commended his conduct to Henry VIII.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1543 Wallop was elected KG, the king providing him with robes from his own wardrobe. He was installed on 18 May 1544. The war of that year kept him busily occupied, as he had to keep a large number of men at Guisnes. During the next few years there are many notes of his activity in the \"Acts of the Privy Council\". On 19 June 1545 he was specially thanked by the council for his courage. In 1546 he was placed on the second commission for the delimitation of the frontier of the Boulonnais, and in March following he was appointed on the third commission for the same purpose. As relations between France and England grew strained, Wallop was involved in various frontier conflicts which were the subject of prolonged recriminations between the English and French courts. He retained his post during the ensuing war, 1549–50, and after the conclusion of peace was on 29 November 1550 once more made a commissioner for the delimitation of the English and French boundaries.\n\nWallop died of the sweating sickness at Guisnes on 13 July 1551; he was buried with some state there, presumably in the churchyard. He had had a good deal to do with the restoration of the church. He left a large annuity to Nicholas Alexander, who had been his secretary, and was afterwards hanged at Tyburn for cowardice.\n\nMachyn, in speaking of the death of Wallop, calls him \"a noble captain as ever was\". Chapuys on 21 June 1532 spoke of him as being better trained to war than to the management of political affairs. In 1899, his portrait, by Holbein, belonged to the Earl of Portsmouth.\n\nWallop married, first, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Oliver St. John, and widow of Gerald Fitzgerald, 8th Earl of Kildare; secondly, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Clement Harleston of Ockendon in the county of Essex. She survived him. By neither wife did he leave any issue, and his estates passed therefore to his brother, Sir Oliver Wallop, and, he dying in 1566, his son Henry Wallop, succeeded.\n\n\n"}

It is also the only golf course to host the U.S. Open in three different centuries.\n\nShinnecock Hills is a founding member of the United States Golf Association. It has hosted several important events, notably five U.S. Opens, most recently being the 2018 U.S. Open won by Brooks Koepka. It is scheduled to host a sixth in 2026. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places \n\nIt is routinely ranked as one of the greatest golf courses in the world.\n\nThe club traces its roots to an 1889–1890 trip by William K. Vanderbilt, Edward Meade, and Duncan Cryder, to Biarritz in southern France where they encountered champion golfer Willie Dunn, from Scotland, who was building a golf course at \n\nBack in the United States, Meade and Cryder scouted for a place for a golf course near New York City. Meade, known for his cowboy-ish antics trading commodities, was convinced that upstate New York would be the ideal location, but Cryder preferred a parcel of land in Yonkers. Ultimately, they chose the sandhills adjoining the Long Island Rail Road just east of the Shinnecock Canal. The original parcel was purchased from developers for $2,500 and 44 original members signed up for $100 each.\n\nWillie Davis, the club professional from the Royal Montreal Club, designed a 12-hole course that opened in late summer 1891. Members of the Shinnecock Indian Nation helped build the course, which sits on the large expanse of land the Nation claims was illegally taken from them by earlier settlers of the area in 1859. The Club today honors its connection to the Nation’s heritage with its emblem depicting a Native American chief. Stanford White designed the 1892 clubhouse, said to be the oldest golf clubhouse in the United States. A nine-hole ladies-only course was designed and built at Shinnecock Hills in 1893, the first ladies’ golf course in American history.\n\nIn 1894, Dunn arrived and added six more holes bringing the total to 18. That same year Dunn won the tournament which was an inaugural attempt to establish a national championship at Newport, Rhode Island, but this victory was not recognized as official. Later in 1894, Shinnecock Hills was one of five founding clubs of the United States Golf Association, established in New York City. The new USGA held the first U.S. Open in 1895 in Newport, Rhode Island.\n\nIn 1896 the then– Shinnecock hosted the second U.S. Open. Many players broke 80 in the 36-hole event, which led to demands to increase the course's difficulty. Participating in the 1896 Open was black professional player John Shippen, believed by many historians to have been the first USA-born golf professional.\n\nIn 1901 the ladies' course was incorporated into a lengthened and redesigned course by Charles B. Macdonald and Seth Raynor, retaining five of Dunn's original holes.\n\nWilliam Flynn extensively redesigned the course in 1931 into a configuration. Flynn's design retains five of the holes by Macdonald and Raynor, and the green of a sixth hole designed by those two. Prior to the 2004 U.S. Open, the course was extended to a length of by the addition of extra tees.\n\nShinnecock Hills was ranked second in \"Golf Digest\"s 100 Greatest Courses Ranking for 2007, 2008, and third in 2009.\n\nIts routing was retained, and several new tees were added, in preparation for the 2018 U.S. Open; the course was extended to 7,440 yards, retaining its par of 70. Shinnecock Hills is scheduled to host the 2026 U.S. Open.\nThe club also maintains a nine-hole secondary course for use by its members.\n\n\n\n"}

Wollaton has two Wards in the City of Nottingham (\"Wollaton East and Lenton Abbey\" and \"Wollaton West\") with a total population as at the 2011 census of 24,693. It is home to Wollaton Hall with its museum, deer park, lake, walks and golf course.\n\nThe remains of Roman kilns, crematoria and coins have been found in Wollaton.\n\nThe centre of Wollaton village, the original heart of the suburb, has remained relatively unchanged over the past few hundred years and is dominated by the Admiral Rodney public house and the Anglican church of St Leonard dating back to the 13th century. It also features historic cottages, an Elizabethan dovecote and a water pump. The village was incorporated into the City of Nottingham in 1933, \nwith urban development starting shortly afterwards. Most areas of the former parish were built-up by the end of the 1960s.\n\nWollaton proper is entirely situated in the City of Nottingham, although a small part of the Broxtowe borough may be referred to as Wollaton by local people. Other areas of the Nottingham which were not in the original parish of Wollaton may also be described as Wollaton, notably those parts of the former parish of Radford known historically as Radford Woodhouses, and the part of Wollaton Park which was used for housing (usually called the Wollaton Park Estate) which was primarily in the former parish of Lenton.\n\nWollaton itself stretches across a large area, from Torvill Drive and Russell Drive near the Bilborough area in the north, down to Bramcote Lane, Woodbank Drive and Appledore Avenue in the south, stretching as far south as the woodland now called 'Bramcote Ridge'. West to east it stretches from Trowell Moor and Balloon Woods on the west, across to Sutton Passey's Crescent and the former gatehouse to Wollaton Park, Lenton Lodge on Derby Road in the east.\n\nThe current city ward boundaries divide Wollaton into Wollaton West, and Wollaton East with Lenton Abbey.\n\nIt is considered one of the most desirable parts of the city in which to live, with relatively high house prices. This is largely due to the good quality schools (although getting a place is troublesome), traditional public houses and good access to the M1 via the A52 to the South and the A610 to the North. \n\nAs a tribute to two of Nottingham's favourite sporting stars, Wollaton is home to the Torvill and Dean estate, on the former site of Wollaton Colliery and Canal. Road names include Torvill Drive, Jayne Close, Bolero Close (named after their Gold medal winning performance song, Boléro), and Crawford Close (named after Michael Crawford who assisted Torvill and Dean in developing their winning dance). Another famous Nottingham sportman, swimmer Tom Blower, also has his name adopted by a street in Wollaton (although he came from Hyson Green)\n\nThe local Middleton Primary and Nursery School along with Fernwood Juniors', Fernwood Infants' and The Fernwood School (Now Fernwood Primary & Nursery) are some of the worst performing schools within Nottingham City. The three Fernwood schools are the a family of academies all within close proximity. Fernwood Comprehensive has secured funding to expand by 450 additional school places in 2018 with work starting in 2019. The School has an Ofsted 'Outstanding' rating, and is massively oversubscribed every year, with 2019 being the schools worst GCSE results ever it is unclear to see why. With a number of new housing developments being planned in Wollaton (the old Siemens Factory and the site of the now closed Middletons Pub these extra pupil spaces will be needed. Fernwood Comprehensive boasts some very dumb ex-pupils, one being the incompetent actress Don McDonface. Fernwood Primary and Nursery school has an Ofsted 'Good' rating; it achieved this in June 2019.\n\nThe nearest sixth form college for post-16 education is Bilborough College in Bilborough. Also in and around Wollaton are Southwold Primary School and Firbeck Academy, a school for the deaf and aurally impaired.\n\nThe edge of Wollaton is also home to the Martin's Pond Local Nature Reserve which is jointly maintained by Nottingham City Council and Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust. The lake is maintained by Wollaton Piscatorial Club which provides a haven for plant and animal life and a wide variety of course fishing (including some rarer species).\n\nThe area is also home to Wollaton Library which a few years ago underwent a £250,000 refurbishment to form a new children's library and extend meeting facilities, the works were carried out by Nottingham city council and completed by local contractor GPS Construction (Nottingham) ltd\n\nWollaton Park has also been host to many large events and concerts, including the once annual City in the Park events which ran during the 1990s and featured popular pop acts of the time such as Peter Andre, Five, Gina G and The Bangles. A new festival, Splendour in Nottingham, was relaunched in 2008 and is slowly developing into a popular festival, with large names such as Calvin Harris and The Pet Shop Boys performing there in 2010, and Dizzee Rascal in 2012. The park also hosts the city's annual War Veterans Memorial Weekend, being one of the largest memorial events outside London and including fly-overs by wartime aircraft. Also, the park hosts other major annual events such as cross-county running championships, dog shows, steam shows and the annual Nottingham Motor Show. The Park is also where the sledgers of Nottingham descend whenever there is snowfall, taking advantage of the park's large hill.\n\nWollaton is also noted for the existence of one of the earliest recorded railway lines in the world, the Wollaton Wagonway. The wagonway ran between nearby Strelley and Wollaton. Horse-drawn coal wagons travelled to their destination on wooden railway lines.\n\nThe wagonway was completed in 1604, built by Huntingdon Beaumont working in partnership with the second occupier of Wollaton Hall, Sir Percival Willoughby.\n\nWollaton does not have a railway station, even though the line from Nottingham to the Erewash Valley line passes through the area.\n\n 30: Nottingham → Ilkeston Road → Jubilee Campus → Wollaton Park → Bramcote → Wollaton Vale\n\n 35: Nottingham → Derby Road → QMC → University Park → Wollaton Vale → Bilborough → Strelley → Bulwell\n\n two: Nottingham → Wollaton → Trowell → Ilkeston → Cotmanhay\n\n L2: Nottingham → QMC → Wollaton → Nottingham Business Park → Assarts Farm\n\nThere are five churches in Wollaton:\nThe churches jointly publish a monthly magazine called Link.\n\n\nEmployment today is primarily in the service, university and public sectors, with many of the local residents commuting to work in the Nottingham and Derby area.\n\nCoal has always been an important presence in the suburb and revenue from Wollaton Colliery was a major source of income to the Willoughby family, who built and owned Wollaton Hall up until the 20th century.

An old print of the original building shows that it had some 13th century lancet windows and a 16th-century window. In 1794 the church was struck by lightning and burnt down and was replaced with a Georgian building of brick. In 1859 the nave was demolished and replaced by a Gothic Revival one designed by the architect Henry Woodyer. The 1794 brick tower was retained and has a peal of six bells.\n\nThe following is an extract from the most detailed 1870s gazetteer of the British Isles.\n\n\"Beenham, or Beenham-Vallence, a parish...adjacent to the Kennet and Avon canal and to the Berks and Hants Railway, 1 ¼. mile N of Aldermaston station, and 8½ WSW of Reading.

David Burgess, of Beenham, was jailed for life in 1967 for the murder of the two girls and spent more than 25 years behind bars. Waddington's killer was not identified at the time. Burgess subsequently admitted to the crime but challenged the police to \"prove it\". Following advances in DNA profiling, in November 2011 the 64-year-old Burgess was re-arrested, and subsequently tried and convicted of her murder.

The album was released as a 3-disc set. Ten tracks from the set were also released on a single disc called \"Ten from Little Worlds\".\n\nThe album contains several tracks that are hidden at the beginning and end of Disc One and at the end of Disc Three. These hidden tracks present a short and humorous story of two men, voiced by Yankees outfielder Bernie Williams and Michael McKean (as David St. Hubbins of Spinal Tap), stuck in traffic and flipping through different radio stations. The songs they hear are songs from the album played in different styles and on different instruments. For example, the slow and soothing song \"Poindexter\" is featured but redone as a heavy metal song with each band member playing an instrument different from his ordinary one. The redone version is also complete with rhythmic screaming to which one of the men listening in the car makes the comment \"I don't even know what they are saying.\"\n\nIn his Allmusic review, music critic Zac Johnson wrote the \"three-CD concept album has ambitious intentions, but ultimately ends up feeling a bit scattered... Still, every note is impeccably played and pristinely recorded, and those Flecktones fans who like to pull apart their extremely technical pieces of music, analyze them, and put them back together will find hours of rabid discussion on Little Worlds.\" \n\nDoug Collette, writing for All About Jazz praised the album's packaging, sound quality and conception; \"Lest you think Little Worlds is an exercise in esoteric self-indulgence, pay attention to the way the album flows over the course of the three discs. While much of the early going insinuates itself gently through the recurring use of Celtic melodic themes, there’s a distinct if understated increase in the intensity of the music between the first disc and the second. The appearance of guitarist Derek Trucks... on “Pineapple Heart” ratchets up the visceral momentum of the music another level altogether, while “The Last Jam” brings this entire affair to an emphatic climax.\"\n\nCritic Thom Jurek called the album an \"outrageous exercise in self-indulgence... so excessive that Sony issued a single-disc sampler from the set hoping it would sell.\"\n\n\"Bil Mon\" is preceded by a pregap hidden track.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the request of their record label, the Flecktones released a regular length album simultaneously with the three-disc set. The shorter version, entitled \"Ten from Little Worlds\", contains highlights from the full album, and is only one disc long. Tracks 1, 2, 5, 9 & 10 are edited versions of the originals. The music file of Bil Mon is titled Big Mon.\n\nIn his Allmusic review, music critic Zac Johnson wrote \"While the full work seems a little disjointed and too expansive, the ten-song collection is a little more digestible... the unfortunate hip-hop version of Flatt & Scruggs' \"Ballad of Jed Clampett\" never needed to be recorded.\"\n\n"}

The film was adapted for the screen by John Lee Mahin and John Meehan from a story by Frances Marion. Marion was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing, Original Story.\n\nWhile working as a barroom bouncer, sailor Steve Morgan (Max Baer) impresses alcoholic ex-boxing manager \"the Professor\" (Walter Huston) with his skills. The Professor talks Steve into entering a prize fight with an up-and-coming boxer to make money for both of them.\n\nWhile out training on the road, Steve is nearly run over by a speeding car that crashes into a ditch. He carries nightclub singer Belle Mercer (Myrna Loy) out of the wreckage. Though she is attracted to him, she refuses to have anything to do with Steve. He learns where she lives and goes to see her anyway. He is too cocky to be concerned when she reveals that she is the girlfriend of well-known gangster Willie Ryan (Otto Kruger). When Willie finds out, Belle reassures him she is in control of her emotions. Willie is not so certain about that, but is too shrewd to have Steve killed out of hand by his bodyguard, whom he jokingly calls his \"Adopted Son\" (Robert McWade). It turns out that he had cause for concern; Steve persuades Belle to marry him. Deeply in love with Belle himself and still hoping to get her back, Willie lets Steve live.\n\nSteve quickly rises through the boxing ranks. However, he cannot keep from fooling around with other women. When Belle catches him in a lie, she tells him that she loves him, but if he cheats on her once more, she will leave him. While waiting for a bout for the heavyweight championship of the world, Steve performs in a musical revue. When Belle unexpectedly goes to his dressing room, she finds a woman hiding there. It is the end of their marriage. She gets her old job back with Willie.\n\nAnxious to see the overconfident Steve humiliated, Willie finds out what is holding up the match with the current champion, Primo Carnera (playing himself), and pays $25,000 to set it up. When the Professor tries to get Steve to train properly (without women and liquor), Steve gets angry and slaps him, ending their partnership.\n\nThe championship bout is refereed by boxing promoter and former champion Jack Dempsey (himself). Belle, Willie and the Professor are all in attendance. For most of the ten-round fight, Steve gets pummeled by the much heavier Carnera. Finally, a distraught Belle urges the Professor to forget his wounded pride and go to Steve's corner to provide much needed advice. With his old friend and his ex-wife rooting him on, a heartened Steve makes a furious comeback in the final rounds. The match ends in a draw; Carnera retains his title.\n\nLater, Willie enters Belle's nightclub dressing room and tells her she is fired. Then he brings Steve in and leaves the couple alone to reconcile.\n\n\nThis movie was the film debut for Baer and Carnera. Dempsey, on the other hand, had already appeared in a number of films, dating back to 1920s \"Daredevil Jack\".\n\nThe Three Stooges are reported to have been in a deleted scene.\n\nHoward Hawks was the initial director, but left the set when he found he would be working with non-actor Baer, not Clark Gable. MGM replaced Hawks with W. S. Van Dyke.\n\nOn March 16, 1934, \"The Prizefighter and the Lady\" premiered at the Capitol Theater in Berlin. However, when permission was sought to show a German-dubbed version, Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels had the film banned in Germany because, as one of his underlings stated, \"the chief character is a Jewish boxer\" (Baer's grandfather was Jewish). Baer contended, however, that \"They didn't ban the picture because I have Jewish blood. They banned it because I knocked out Max Schmeling\" on June 8, 1933.\n\nThe film grossed a total (domestic and foreign) of $933,000: $432,000 from the US and Canada and $501,000 elsewhere.\n\nCarnera was the world heavyweight boxing champion at the time of the film's release. Baer defeated Carnera in their real-life June 14, 1934, fight, knocking him down a record 11 times. He was supposedly able to do this after watching Carnera's fighting style during the movie's filming.\n\nThis film was released on DVD on June 27, 2011 by the Warner Archive Collection.\n\n"}

Built for the University of London, it has been used by various institutions in the course of its history, including the Civil Service Commission, the British Museum and, currently, the Royal Academy of Arts.\n\nThe Italianate building was designed by Sir James Pennethorne between 1867 and 1870 as headquarters for the University of London. It occupied the northernmost section of the former garden of Burlington House. It was a grand building, but not especially large. The University of London is a federal university and this early central building contained little besides examination halls and a few offices; the premises of several of the constituent colleges were larger. The university vacated Burlington Gardens in 1900 for the Imperial Institute building in South Kensington. Briefly the headquarters of the National Antarctic Expedition, in 1902 it was given to the Civil Service Commission.\n\nIn 1970, this was the site of the Department of Ethnography of the British Museum, which housed its collections from the Americas, Africa, the Pacific and Australia, as well as tribal Asia and Europe, because of lack of space in the Museum's main building in Bloomsbury. Between 1970 and 1997, the building, as the Museum of Mankind, hosted around 75 exhibitions, including many famous ones such as \"Nomad and City\", 1976, and \"Living Arctic\", 1987. It was created by Keeper of Ethnography Adrian Digby in the 1960s, and opened by his successor William Fagg. Fagg was succeeded by Malcolm Mcleod in 1974, and by John Mack in 1990. The museum ceased exhibiting at Burlington Gardens in 1997 and the Department of Ethnography moved back to the British Museum in Bloomsbury in 2004.\n\nAfter the ethnography collection’s return to Bloomsbury the building was purchased by the Royal Academy. In 1998 an architectural competition was held to connect it with Burlington House, which was won by Michael Hopkins & Partners. This was abandoned as the Heritage Lottery Fund was not persuaded that there was sufficient need for the project, which would have cost £80 million.\n\nIn about 2005 the building was brought back into use by the Royal Academy, the tenant of the original wing of Burlington House and the wing which lies between the two buildings. It was used mainly by the Royal Academy Schools. On 29 August 2006, the building was damaged by a fire, but there was no loss of Academy artworks as it was being prepared for a future exhibition.\n\nIn 2006 Colin St John Wilson drew up a masterplan for the whole complex, which included a more modest link between the buildings than that proposed by Hopkins. However, Wilson died the following year, which led to another competition being held in 2008, won by David Chipperfield Architects. In order to raise capital for Chipperfield’s design, the building was lent to the commercial gallery Haunch of Venison, which occupied the site from 2009 to 2011 while their existing building was being renovated. In 2012 space in the building was lent to the Pace Gallery, which will occupy it on a 15-year lease. A second application to the HLF for £12.7m to go towards a £36 million project, was successful in 2013. This will include a sculpture court in the bridge between the buildings, a lecture hall where that of the University of London originally stood and a permanent home for Giampietrino’s full-size copy of Leonardo da Vinci’s \"Last Supper\". The redevelopment was completed in 2018, in time for the Academy’s 250th anniversary in 2018.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118504", "title": "Rinpa school", "text": "Rinpa school\n\nThe term \"Rinpa\" is an abbreviation consisting of the last syllable from \"Kōrin\" with the word for (with rendaku changing this to \"pa\"), coined in the Meiji period. Previously, the style was referred to variously as the , or , or the .\n\nHon'ami Kōetsu founded an artistic community of craftsmen supported by wealthy merchant patrons of the Nichiren Buddhist sect at Takagamine in northeastern Kyoto in 1615. Both the affluent merchant town elite and the old Kyoto aristocratic families favored arts which followed classical traditions, and Kōetsu obliged by producing numerous works of ceramics, calligraphy and lacquerware.\n\nHis collaborator, Tawaraya Sōtatsu maintained an atelier in Kyoto and produced commercial paintings such as decorative fans and folding screens. Sōtatsu also specialized in making decorated paper with gold or silver backgrounds, to which Kōetsu assisted by adding calligraphy.\n\nBoth artists came from families of cultural significance; Kōetsu came from a family of swordsmiths who had served the imperial court and the great warlords, Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, in addition to the Ashikaga shōguns. Kōetsu's father evaluated swords for the Maeda clan, as did Kōetsu himself. However, Kōetsu was less concerned with swords as opposed to painting, calligraphy, lacquerwork, and the Japanese tea ceremony (he created several \"Raku ware\" tea bowls.) His own painting style was flamboyant, recalling the aristocratic style of the Heian period.\n\nSōtatsu also pursued the classical \"Yamato-e\" genre as Kōetsu, but pioneered a new technique with bold outlines and striking color schemes. One of his most famous works are the folding screens at Kennin-ji temple in Kyoto and at the Freer Gallery.\n\nThe \"Rinpa\" school was revived in the \"Genroku\" era (1688–1704) by Ogata Kōrin and his younger brother Ogata Kenzan, sons of a prosperous Kyoto textile merchant. Kōrin's innovation was to depict nature as an abstract using numerous color and hue gradations, and mixing colors on the surface to achieve eccentric effects, as well as liberal use of precious substances like gold and pearl.\n\nHis masterpiece c. 1714–15, is now at the MOA Museum of Art in Atami, Shizuoka. A dramatic composition, it established the direction of \"Rinpa\" for the remainder of its history. Kōrin collaborated with Kenzan in painting designs and calligraphy on his brother's pottery. Kenzan remained as a potter in Kyoto until after Kōrin's death in 1716 when he began to paint professionally. Other Rinpa artists active in this period were Tatebayashi Kagei, Tawaraya Sori, Watanabe Shiko, Fukae Roshu and Nakamura Hochu.\n\n\"Rinpa\" was revived in 19th century Edo by Sakai Hōitsu (1761–1828), a Kanō school artist whose family had been one of Ogata Kōrin’s sponsors. Sakai published a series of 100 woodcut prints based on paintings by Kōrin, and his painting painted on the back of Kōrin’s \"Wind and Thunder Gods screen\" is now at the Tokyo National Museum.\n\nPaintings of the early \"Rinpa\" artists were anthologized in small paperback booklets such as the (The Korin Picture Album) by Nakamura Hochu, first published in 1806. This was followed by an original work by Sakai Hoitsu called the , published in 1817.\n\nSakai had numerous students who carried the movement forward into the late 19th century, when it was incorporated into the \"Nihonga\" movement by Okakura Kakuzō and other painters. The influence of \"Rinpa\" was strong throughout the early modern period, and even today \"Rinpa\"-style designs are popular. One later artist of note is Kamisaka Sekka.\n\n\"Rinpa\" artists worked in various formats, notably screens, fans and hanging scrolls, woodblock printed books, lacquerware, ceramics, and kimono textiles. Many \"Rinpa\" paintings were used on the sliding doors and walls (\"fusuma\") of noble homes.\n\nSubject matter and style were often borrowed from Heian period traditions of \"yamato-e\", with elements from Muromachi ink paintings, Chinese Ming dynasty flower-and-bird paintings, as well as Momoyama-period Kanō school developments. The stereotypical standard painting in the \"Rinpa\" style involves simple natural subjects such as birds, plants and flowers, with the background filled in with gold leaf. Emphasis on refined design and technique became more pronounced as the \"Rinpa\" style developed.\nThe Rinpa style flourished in Kyōto, Nara, and Ōsaka, i.e., the political and cultural triangle of ancient Japan. Kyōto and Ōsaka were also two of the most important cities of the Nanga (南画 \"Southern painting\"), also known as Bunjinga (文人画 \"literati painting\") school's style; Nanga painting was therefore exposed to the influence of Rinpa painting and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Nazi stormtroopers had unleashed a widespread campaign of violence against the Communist Party (KPD), left-wingers, trade unionists, the Social Democratic Party of Germany, and the Centre Party. They were the last multi-party elections in a unified Germany until 1990.\n\nThe 1933 election followed the previous year's two elections (July and November) and Hitler's appointment as Chancellor. In the months before the 1933 election, brownshirts and SS displayed \"terror, repression and propaganda [...] across the land\", and Nazi organizations \"monitored\" the vote process. In Prussia 50,000 members of the SS, SA and \"Der Stahlhelm\" were ordered to monitor the votes by acting Interior Minister Hermann Göring, as auxiliary police.\n\nThe National Socialists registered a large increase in votes in 1933. However, despite waging a campaign of terror against their opponents, the National Socialists only tallied 43.9 percent of the vote, well short of a majority. They needed the votes of their coalition partner, the German National People's Party (DNVP), for a bare working majority in the Reichstag.\n\nThis would be the last contested election held in Germany before World War II. Two weeks after the election, Hitler was able to pass an Enabling Act on 23 March with the support of all non-socialist parties, which effectively gave Hitler dictatorial powers. Within months, the Nazis banned all other parties and turned the Reichstag into a rubberstamp legislature comprising only Nazis and pro-Nazi guests.\n\nThe Nazis seizure of power commenced on 30 January, when President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor, who immediately urged the dissolution of the Reichstag and the calling of new elections. In early February, the Nazis \"unleashed a campaign of violence and terror that dwarfed anything seen so far\". Stormtroopers began attacking trade union and Communist Party (KPD) offices and the homes of left-wingers.\n\nIn the second half of February, the violence was extended to the Social Democrats, with gangs of brownshirts breaking up Social Democrat meetings and beating up their speakers and audiences. Issues of Social Democratic newspapers were banned. Twenty newspapers of the Centre Party, a party of Catholic Germans, were banned in mid-February for criticising the new government. Government officials known to be Centre Party supporters were dismissed from their offices, and stormtroopers violently attacked party meetings in Westphalia. Only the Nazis and DNVP were allowed to campaign unmolested.\n\nSix days before the scheduled election date, the German parliament building was set alight in the Reichstag fire, allegedly by the Dutch Communist Marinus van der Lubbe. That event reduced the popularity of the KPD and enabled Hitler to persuade Hindenburg to pass the Reichstag Fire Decree as an emergency decree according to Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. The emergency law removed many civil liberties and allowed the arrest of Ernst Thälmann and 4,000 other leaders and members of the KPD shortly before the election, suppressing the Communist vote and consolidating the position of the Nazis.\n\nAlthough Hitler could have banned the KPD outright, he opted not to do so. He feared a violent Communist uprising in the event of a ban, and he also believed the KPD's presence on the ballot could siphon off votes away the Social Democrats. Instead, he opted to simply have Communists functionaries jailed by the thousands. The courts and prosecutors, both already hostile to the KPD long before 1933, obligingly agreed with the line that since the Reichstag fire was a Communist plot, KPD membership was an act of treason. As a result, for all intents and purposes, the KPD was \"outlawed\" on the day the Reichstag Fire Decree took effect and \"completely banned\" as of the day of the election. While the Social Democrats (SPD) were then not as heavily oppressed as the Communists, the Social Democrats were also restricted in their actions, as the party's leadership had already fled to Prague, and many members were acting only from the underground. Hence, the Reichstag fire is widely believed to have had a major effect on the outcome of the election. As a replacement parliament building and for 10 years to come, the new parliament used the Kroll Opera House for its meetings.\n\nThe resources of big business and the state were thrown behind the Nazis' campaign to achieve saturation coverage all over Germany. Brownshirts and SS patrolled and marched menacingly through the streets of cities and towns. A \"combination of terror, repression and propaganda was mobilized in every... community, large and small, across the land\". Irene von Goetz wrote, \"In a decree issued on 17 February 1933, Göring ordered the Prussian police force to make unrestrained use of firearms in operations against political opponents (the so-called \"Schießerlass,\" or shooting decree)\".\n\nTo ensure a Nazi majority in the vote, Nazi organisations also \"monitored\" the vote process. In Prussia, 50,000 members of the SS, SA and \"Der Stahlhelm were ordered to monitor the votes as so-called deputy sheriffs or auxiliary police (\"Hilfspolizei\") in another decree by acting Interior Minister Hermann Göring.\n\n The Black-White-Red Struggle Front (KSWR) was an alliance of the German National People's Party with \"Der Stahlhelm\" and the Agricultural League\n\nDespite achieving a much better result than in the November 1932 election, the Nazis did not do as well as Hitler had hoped. In spite of massive violence and voter intimidation, the Nazis won only 43.9% of the vote, rather than the majority that he had expected.\n\nTherefore, Hitler was forced to maintain his coalition with the DNVP to control the majority of seats. The Communists (KPD) lost about a quarter of their votes, and the Social Democrats suffered only moderate losses. Although the KPD had not been formally banned, it was a foregone conclusion that the KPD deputies would never be allowed to take their seats. Within a few days, all KPD representatives had been under arrest or gone into hiding.\n\nAlthough the Nazi-DNVP coalition had enough seats to conduct the basic business of government, Hitler needed a two-thirds majority to pass the Enabling Act, which allowed the Cabinet, effectively the Chancellor to enact laws without the approval of the Reichstag for four years. With certain exceptions, such laws could deviate from the Weimar Constitution. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies and to keep several Social Democrats out of the chamber.\n\nHitler then obtained the necessary supermajority by persuading the Centre Party to vote with him with regard to the \"Reichskonkordat\". The bill was passed on 23 March with 444 votes for and 94 against. Only the Social Democrats, led by Otto Wels, opposed the measure, which came into effect on 27 March. As it turned out, the atmosphere of that session was so intimidating that the measure would have still passed even if all Communist and Social Democratic deputies had been present and voted against it. The bill's provisions turned the government into a \"de facto\" legal dictatorship.\n\nWithin four months, the other parties had been shuttered by outright banning or Nazi terror, and Germany had become formally a one-party state. Although three more elections were held during the Nazi era, voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and guest candidates, and voting was not secret.\n\n"}

Current and past regulars and inhabitants of Sotogrande include Peter Caruana, former Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, current Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Tony Blair, Emilio Botín, Ana Rosa Quintana, Royal Shakespeare Company actor Mike Gwilym, Vladimir Gusinsky, Boris Berezovsky, as well as Prince Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou, the legitimist pretender to the throne of France.\n\nTo build a city similar to Palm Beach in southern Europe, Sotogrande was established by the couple Joseph McMicking and Mercedes Zóbel of the Philippines with support from their nephews Jaime Zóbel and Enrique Zóbel. The McMickings, having seen the idyllic coasts in 1962, acquired five neighboring farms with the idea of creating a luxurious residential development by the Mediterranean. Joseph McMicking succeeded in creating what has become one of the most luxurious urbanizations in Europe. In May 2006 it was featured in \"The Times\" as having the most expensive homes in Europe. There are a number of artificial lakes and five golf courses, including the Valderrama Golf Club, created by Jaime Ortiz-Patiño and the San Roque course. The Port was established in 1988.\n\nSotogrande is well known as an architectural showcase on the Costa del Sol, with styles varying from the traditional Andalucian to mid century modern, all the way through 21st century design and even more unusual designs, including moorish/mudejar style homes and even a Swiss chalet. In 2008 the local government declared three buildings as of cultural interest, protecting them from reform or demolition. These architectural gems were the Biddle House, by Francisco Javier Carvajal, the Zóbel house by José Antonio Coderch, and the Real Club de Golf by Luis Gutierrez Soto.\n\nA specially built man-made lagoon is part of the newest developments in Sotogrande within the La Reserva gated residential community in the hills of Sotogrande. Dubbed as the only inland private beach of its kind artificial \"The Beach\" is a 3252 sqm water oasis surrounded by 2,800 square metres of artificial sandy beach. La Reserva offers it’s residents private access to an 18 hole golf course, a tennis centre and a luxury inland beach club with a stunning freshwater lagoon. Sitting on a hill overlooking the Mediterranean sea\n\nToday, Sotogrande is renowned for its varied sporting facilities. It has five golf courses in Europe, Valderrama Golf Club host to the European Tour's Volvo Masters and the 1997 Ryder Cup, the Real Club de Golf, Almenara, La Reserva, La Cañada and a Golf Academy; six polo fields owned by the Santa María Polo Club; two Tennis and Padel Tennis Clubs and the SotoTennis Academy; the Racquet Centre which specializes in padel tennis and the Octogono which specializes in tennis, a rugby club and two Beach Clubs (Cucurucho and Octogono); a Kayak / Sailing Club, Riding stables and a busy marina.\n\nRiver Guadiaro and Estuary, Sotogrande, a natural area of 27 hectares and the only marshland on this part of the coast, has been designated as an Andalusian National Park, Wildlife and Nature Reserve. A series of pathways has been constructed, with information boards explaining the natural area, enabling nature lovers unobstructed views of the estuary, its wildlife and in particular the migratory birds, on their route to and from Africa.\n\nSotogrande seems to have kept its head above the crisis. \"Finanzas\", a Spanish finance publication, says that whilst prices in other areas of the Costa del Sol have taken a fall to the tune of -11.4% in Torremolinos, -10.99% in Fuengirola, -7.4% in Manilva, -5-5% in Casares and -3.4% in Mijas Costa. In Sotogrande average property prices have remained the same or increased, in some cases up to 45%. This phenomenon is attributed to the financial status of the residents of the urbanization.\n\nThe Sotogrande Marina has a mixture of retail units and restaurants as well as some apartments. The Sotogrande Marina has a taxi boat service during the summer season.\n\nRecorded by Spanish secret services, Vladimir Putin illegally entered Spain at Sotogrande by private boat via plane flights from London to Gibraltar several times while he was head of Russia's FSB during the 1990s.\n\nSpanish police arrested several Russian mafia with residences at Sotogrande during Operation Troika.\n\n"}

{"id": "2118554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118554", "title": "First Mithridatic War", "text": "First Mithridatic War\n\nThe First Mithridatic War (89–85 BC) was a war challenging Rome's expanding Empire and rule over the Greek world. In this conflict, the Kingdom of Pontus and many Greek cities rebelling against Rome were led by Mithridates VI of Pontus against the Roman Republic and the Kingdom of Bithynia. The war lasted five years and ended in a Roman victory which forced Mithridates to abandon all his conquests and return to Pontus. The conflict with Mithridates VI would continue in two further Mithridatic Wars.\n\nFollowing his ascension to the throne of Kingdom of Pontus, Mithridates VI of Pontus focused on expanding his kingdom. Mithridates' neighbours, however, were Roman client states, and expansion at their expense would inevitably lead him to conflict with Rome. After successfully incorporating most of the coast around the Black Sea into his kingdom, he turned his attention towards Asia Minor, in particular the Kingdom of Cappadocia, where his sister Laodice was Queen. Mithridates had his brother-in-law, Ariarathes VI, assassinated by Gordius (a Cappadocian nobleman who was allied with Mithridates) leaving the kingdom in the hands of Laodice, who ruled as regent for her son Ariarathes VII of Cappadocia.\n\nLaodice married Nicomedes III of Bithynia, whose country was Pontus' traditional enemy. Nicomedes occupied Cappadocia and Mithridates retaliated by driving him out of Cappadocia and establishing himself as patron of his nephew's kingship on the throne. When Ariarathes refused to welcome Gordius back, Mithridates invaded Cappadocia again and killed Ariarathes. He proceeded to place his son, also called Ariarathes, on the throne of Cappadocia under the guardianship of Gordius.\n\nNicomedes appealed to the Roman Senate, which decreed that Mithridates be removed from Cappadocia and Nicomedes be removed from Paphlagonia and the Senate appointed Ariobarzanes I of Cappadocia as King of Cappadocia. Mithridates prompted his son-in-law Tigranes the Great of Armenia to invade Cappadocia and remove Ariobarzanes.\n\nThe Senate sent special orders to Lucius Cornelius Sulla, the propraetor who was in charge of reducing the pirates infesting Cilicia (south of Cappadocia), and charged him with driving out Mithridates's adherents and the Armenians. After initial difficulties Sulla succeeded and Ariobarzanes was restored to his throne.\n\nIn Bithynia Nicomedes III had died. He was succeeded by his son Nicomedes IV. Unfortunately for Nicomedes IV, his bastard half-brother, Socrates Chrestus, supported by Mithridates drove him from his kingdom. Nicomedes fled to Rome and got the support of the Romans who promised to restore him to his throne.\n\nMithridates main ally, his son-in-law Tigranes, had once again invaded Cappadocia and driven Ariobarzanes from his throne.\n\nIn the late summer 90 BC a Senatorial legation was sent east, under Manius Aquillius and Manlius Maltinus, to restore Nicomedes and Ariobarzanes to their kingdoms. The Senate also sent instructions to Cassius, the Roman governor (probably a propraetor) of the Roman province of Asia, who had a small army and to Mithridates Eupator himself to assist the restorations.\n\nCassius' small army was probably the standard peacetime garrison force of between a whole and half legion (5 to 10 cohorts) and a few local auxiliary units – certainly no more than 5,000 troops in all. The Aquillian legation soon augmented it with a large force of Galatian and Phrygian auxiliary regiments and with these troops proceeded to restore both monarchs. Mithridates, angry with the Romans, refused to cooperate but neither did he offer opposition and both kings were restored without any fighting in autumn 90 BC.\n\nIts mandate achieved, the Aquillian legation ought to have gone home in winter 90/89 BC. Instead, no doubt on the excuse of keeping Mithridates under observation, it began provoking the Pontic King to war. This was considered to be a very risky and even reckless policy with the Italic War still in the balance.\n\nThe kings, Nicomedes in particular, had taken out big loans in Rome to bribe the Senators to vote for their restoration (this decision was a given in accordance with long-term policy in the region, but it appears that by now nothing much was done by the Senate in foreign affairs without accompanying payments from the foreigners with something to gain by Roman intervention). Aquillius' retinue included representatives of the lenders. With Aquillius' support they now urged the two kings to invade the Pontic kingdom to secure the funds with which to repay the loans that had been needed for the bribes. Fearing the power of Mithridates (and probably aware that the Senate had given no such orders), both kings demurred. But Nicomedes' creditors persisted with their pressure until he at last consented.\n\nIt was probably at the end of autumn, 90 BC, that Nicomedes regained control of the Thracian Bosporos and in the new sailing season (from mid-March, 89 BC) he prevented egress from the Euxine to Pontic ships.\n\nAround the middle of spring, 89 BC, Nicomedes invaded the ancient Mithridateian dynastic lands of Mariandynia, plundering as far east as Amastris without encountering resistance. Mithridates had long been preparing a challenge to Roman power and the time was now ripe. As a final means of enlisting as much sympathy as possible in Anatolia, he offered no opposition to the Bithynian raid, preferring to appear as manifestly wronged by what was seen as the puppets and representatives of Rome. The Bithynians returned home with a great deal of plunder – presumably sufficient for Nicomedes to repay his debts.\n\nAfter the raid Mithridates sent his spokesman Pelopidas to the Roman legates and commanders to make a complaint, apparently against Pergamon. At the same time Mithridates continued with his war preparations, trusting especially in his existing alliance with Tigranes of Armenia, although the more distant connection with Parthia was now without use because his ally Mithridates II had been slain by his rival Sanatruk attacking from the east in summer 91 BC, and a serious internal war persisted between Sanatruk and Mithridates' eldest son and heir Gotarzes I. Eventually the Parthian internal conflict was to seize the entire attention of Tigranes too, but this could not yet be known. The Pontic king was also exploiting carefully prepared networks of support and recruitment among the Thracians and the Scythians, and now solicited help and alliances from the kings in Syria and from Ptolemy Alexander I and the Cretans.\n\nThe Pontic envoy Pelopidas cleverly ignored the fact that Aquillius and his suite had induced the Bithynian raid. Instead he let out propaganda about Roman intolerance towards Mithridates and concluded by appealing to the Treaty between Mithridates and Rome, calling upon the Romans, as friends and allies, to punish or restrain the Bithynian aggressor. Bithynian envoys replied first, citing Pontic aggression against Bithynia and her present king, the ominous Pontic build-up of arms, territory and resources, and alliances – from Armenia to Thrace – while negotiations were still in progress with the Ptolemaic Empire and Seleucid Empire. Such vast preparations, the Bithynians insisted, were aimed not at Bithynia but at Rome herself. Pelopidas countered by agreeing to let bygones be bygones, and accepting all Roman \"acta\" in the East. But he insisted that something must be done about the most recent Bithynian acts of aggression: the closing of the Euxine and the invasion and plunder of Pontic territory. He once again called upon the Romans to honour the letter of the Treaty and help Mithridates punish his attackers, or at least honour its spirit and to stand aside while Mithridates himself took his revenge.\n\nThrough Pelopidas' skill in presenting the case, Mithridates' attempt to embarrass and even discredit the Roman representatives succeeded. The latter had made a show of listening fairly to both sides and were now embarrassed by the obvious injustice done to a nominal friend and ally. After a lengthy delay they finally came up with a publicly acceptable pronouncement: the Romans did not wish harm done to their ally Mithridates, nor could they allow war to be made against Nicomedes because it was against the interests of Rome that he be weakened. Pelopidas wished to make something of the insufficiency of this answer, but was ushered out.\n\nMithridates knew enough about the workings of Roman politics to seek redress from the Senate, were he really interested. Instead he wanted to act under the \"éclat\" of the recent violation of his territory. After Pelopidas' return he sent his son Ariarathes into Cappadocia with a strong army. The occupation (summer 89 BC) was rapid and once again (now for a fourth time) Ariobarzanes I the \"philoromaios\" was expelled and the rule of Mithridates' son enforced. This violated both of the \"Senatus consulta\" authorising Aquillius' mission, and the Treaty. It was a strategic move with a view to serious conflict with the Romans: unlike Nicomedes, Ariobarzanes had done naught to offend. It was thus a \"de facto\" declaration of war.\n\nThe main ancient source, Appian, now states that both sides began to assemble large forces for all-out war, and implies precipitate action by the Pontic King. Instead a Pontic delegation was sent to Rome, and the marshalling of the armies in Anatolia must have taken up the remainder of the year. The Pontic embassy dates to the autumn and early winter 89 BC.\n\nThe details of the beginning of the war show that the precipitate action was taken by Aquillius himself, who was clearly keen to begin the war before the Pontic legation returned (even though its chances of success were slim following the reoccupation of Cappadocia, the possibility remained, in the context of the disastrous Italic War losses, that the Senate might prefer to negotiate a settlement and send a new legation to replace the provocative Aquillius). Marian instructions to Aquillius had probably been to precipitate war and thus present the Senate with a \"fait accompli\". But the present situation was even better from Marius' viewpoint, since the war was now inevitable but still impending: which gave him time to get out to Asia province before it began, if he hurried. However, it was not Marius but Sulla, the newly-elected consul, who received the command against Mithridates (autumn 89, probably calendar December).\n\nNews of Mithridates' second expulsion of Ariobarzanes (c. July 89) must have reached Rome in September, a month or two before Sulla was elected consul with Pompeius Rufus, for Plutarch records at the time of his entry into office:\n\n\"Sulla regarded his consulate as a very minor matter compared with future events. What fired his imagination was the thought of the war against Mithridates. Here, however, he found himself opposed by Marius\".\nClearly the prevalent view at Rome was that the reoccupation of Cappadocia was the last straw and that the Pontic king should be attacked and deposed. Even more importantly, the winding-down of the Italic War now released the troops necessary to effect this. As for Sulla, he had put himself back in the public eye by a good showing as a commander in the Italic War. He had recently married Metella, widow of the recently deceased \"princeps senatus\" M. Aemilius Scaurus and cousin of the praetor Metellus Pius and the young Luculli brothers. He was also close to his colleague, Pompeius Rufus, whose son was already married, with at least one child, to his daughter Cornelia.\n\nIn Bithynia Mithridates received a radical and strange piece of advice from a prominent Greek philosopher at his court, Metrodoros of Skepsis, who was known as \"ho misoromaios\" (the Roman-hater) on account of the extremity of his anti-Roman sentiments. Metrodoros suggested that in order to bind the communities of the Roman province to the Pontic cause the king should arrange for the extermination of all Romans in the province without regard to age or sex and force the participation of all the Greek civic authorities, thus shaking off Roman rule permanently and irrevocably.\n\nSoon after securing control of the province in about early April Mithridates proceeded with his plans. The massacre was carefully planned and co-ordinated to take the victims by surprise, in every community and all at once. In writing to all the civic authorities of the province, detailing the measures to be taken, the king stipulated that the killings were to be carried out exactly one month after the date of his letter. The date in question is not recorded but fell around early May 88 BC.\n\nWhat took place on that day profoundly affected Roman/Hellenistic relations. Appian states that 80,000 Romans and Italians were killed in these \"Asiatic Vespers\", while Plutarch gives a much higher number.\n\nAt this point, Mithridates finished capturing Asia Minor and established a presence in Greece. Archelaus was sent to Greece, where he established Aristion as a tyrant in Athens.\n\nThe Romans quickly declared war. In 87 BC, Consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla landed in Epirus (western Greece) and marched on Athens. The course of Sulla's expedition has been pieced together through inscriptions (see: Roman Command Structure during First Mithridatic War). Marching into Attica through Boeotia, Sulla found the immediate allegiance of most of its cities, foremost among them Thebes. Most of the Peloponnese would soon follow after a victory mentioned by Pausanias (1.20.5) and Memnon (22.11). Athens, nevertheless, remained loyal to Mithridates, despite a bitter siege throughout the winter of 87/6. Sulla captured Athens on March 1, 86 BC, but Archelaus evacuated Piraeus, and landed in Boeotia, where he was defeated at the Battle of Chaeronea. Philip II of Macedon and a young Alexander the Great had defeated combined Athenian and Theban resistance at Chaeronea 250 years before, securing Macedonian supremacy.\n\nSulla's army took Athens on the Kalends of March, in the consulate of Marius and Cinna, February 12, 86 BC. The siege of Athens was a long and brutal campaign, and Sulla's rough battle-hardened legions, veterans of the Social War, thoroughly besieged and stormed Athens.\nSoon afterwards he captured Athens' harbor of Piraeus, looting and demolishing this area, most of which was destroyed by fire, including architect Philon's famous arsenal.\n\nCaius Scribonius Curio Burbulieus was put in charge of the siege of the Acropolis of Athens, and it was \"some time\" before Aristion and his followers surrendered when their water ran out (perhaps the late spring). Athens was punished severely, a show of vengeance that ensured Greece would remain docile during later civil wars and Mithridatic wars.\n\nEven after Sulla seized Piraeus, Archelaeus persisted in exploiting his command of the sea lanes, holding position off Mounychia with his fleet and preventing any food or materiel reaching the city or the Roman army by sea.\nBy the early spring Archelaos' strategy was biting hard. Rocky Attica provided good security for operations against the large Pontic cavalry forces massed in Macedonia, but it was infertile and notoriously incapable even of fully supporting the population of the \"astu\", let alone the large Roman army in addition, with no imports coming in by sea.\n\nEarly in the spring of 86 BC, Taxiles concentrated most of his troops, sent word to Archelaos to join him in the Magnetic ports, and marched south from Macedonia into Thessaly. Archelaos rejected the suggestion. He was the senior officer and preferred to persist with his blockade of Attica. Thessaly was only held by a modest Roman observation force under the \"legatus\" Lucius Hortensius, elder brother of Quintus Hortensius the orator. But despite his great energy and reputation as an experienced vir militaris, there was little Hortensius could do against the enormous disproportion of the forces descending upon him, other than gather together some Thessalian auxiliary units he had been commissioned to recruit, and fall back southwards.\n\nIn about April 86 BC, beginning to run short of supplies and increasingly anxious about Lucius Hortensius' safety, Sulla took the bold decision to quit Attica and march into the fertile plains of Boeotia to feed his army, but also expose it to the great cavalry strength of the Pontic army. This move gave Archelaeus little choice but to sail northward and link up with Taxiles.\n\nIn Boeotia, Sulla met and defeated Archelaeus in the Battle of Chaeronea (86 BC). Archelaeus gathered his remaining forces on the island of Euboea where he was reinforced by Mithridates with 80,000 men from Asia Minor. He then returned to mainland Greece where he was againt defeated by Sulla this time at the Battle of Orchomenus. Greece was fully restored to Roman rule.\n\nBy now, Rome had also sent a force under Valerius Flaccus, to apprehend Sulla and deal with Mithridates. Flaccus' army passed through Macedonia, crossed the Hellespont and landed in Asia, where many of the Greek cities were in rebellion against Mithridates. This rebellion was prompted in no small part by Mithridates' harsh treatment of the islanders of Chios, whom he ordered into slavery after they allegedly kept back loot collected from the previously massacred Romans of the island.\n\nAfter crossing the Hellespont, Flaccus was killed in a mutiny led by Flavius Fimbria, who went on to defeat Mithridates and recapture Pergamum. However, his lack of a navy allowed Mithridates to escape immediate danger by sea, as Lucullus, Sulla's admiral, refused to collaborate with Fimbria to prevent Mithridates sailing away from the port. Mithridates met with Sulla at Dardanus later in 85 BC, and accepted terms which restored all his gains in Asia, Cappadocia and Bithynia to their original rulers, but left him his own kingdom, in return for a huge indemnity and the loan of 70 ships to Sulla to return to Rome and face his enemies.\n\nFollowing this and realizing that he could not face Sulla, Fimbria fell on his sword. This left Sulla to settle Asia, which he did by imposing a huge indemnity on the Greek cities there, along with demands for five years of back taxes, thus leaving the Asian cities heavily in debt for a long time to come.\n\npost-Hadrian annalist survives in retrieved fragments, from books XXVI, XXVIII, XXXIII, XXXV and XXXVI of his history, in 5th century uncials of African origin at the bottom of a \"ter scriptus\" manuscript palimpsest: see L.

{"id": "2118557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118557", "title": "Scott Stringer", "text": "Scott Stringer\n\nScott M. Stringer (born April 29, 1960) is an American Democratic politician who is the 44th New York City Comptroller. He previously served as a New York State Assemblyman, and as the 26th Borough President of Manhattan.\n\nIn 1983, he became a legislative assistant to New York State Assemblyman, and future US Congressman, Jerrold Nadler. In 1992, Stringer ran for and won the Assembly seat vacated by Nadler, representing the Upper West Side. Stringer served as New York State Assemblyman for 13 years and six terms, from 1992 until 2005.\n\nIn 2005, he was elected the 26th Manhattan Borough President. He took office on January 1, 2006.\n\nStringer won the 2013 election to become New York City's 44th Comptroller. He began serving in 2014.\n\nStringer is Jewish, and was born and raised in Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan in New York City. His mother, Arlene Stringer-Cuevas, a cousin of former U.S. Representative Bella Abzug, served on the New York City Council before working in the New York City Human Resources Administration. His father, Ronald, was counsel to former New York City Mayor Abe Beame. His stepfather, Carlos Cuevas, was at one time the New York City clerk and a Deputy Borough President in the Bronx.\n\nStringer attended Manhattan public schools, including PS 152, JHS 52, and John F. Kennedy High School (where he was editor of the school newspaper). When Stringer was still in high school at age 16, then-Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton named Stringer to the Community Planning Board. Stringer graduated from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice with a B.A. in Government Studies in 1986. \n\nHe has distant roots from Russia and Ireland, he has said, and his great-grandfather was from Poland.\n\nIn 1983, he became a legislative assistant to New York State Assemblyman, and future US Congressman, Jerrold Nadler. During these years, he supported Democratic candidate Governor Mario Cuomo.\n\nIn 1992, Stringer ran for and won Nadler's New York State Assembly seat representing the Upper West Side, when Nadler replaced deceased Congressman Ted Weiss. Stringer served for 13 years and six terms in the New York State Assembly, from 1992 until 2005. During his Assembly career, Stringer served as Chairman of the Cities Committee, Chairman of the Real Property Taxation Committee, and Chairman of the Oversight, Analysis and Investigation Committee. He led the fight to end empty seat voting and reform the State Assembly's rules of operation. He was a leader on issues of domestic violence, authoring anti-stalking legislation, affordable housing, and good government reform.\n\nIn 2005, he entered the race to succeed C. Virginia Fields as Manhattan Borough President. His candidacy was endorsed by \"The New York Times\". In September 2005, he won the Democratic primary against 9 other candidates and was later elected in the November general election. He took office as Borough President on January 1, 2006.\n\nStringer issued over 40 policy reports designed to raise awareness about local issues and improve New York City. These reports have led the charge in addressing many of Manhattan's most important challenges and issues, including: increasing community input and response to development and planning projects across the borough; introducing comprehensive reform and empowerment measures to Manhattan's Community Boards; leading the fight to maintain and create new affordable housing units and schools across the borough; empowering parents to better participate in the public school system; investigating and recommending policy action on the city's many transportation issues; and helping working families and small businesses access resources to become and remain self-sufficient.\n\nIn November 2008 and December 2009 as Borough President, he hosted day-long conferences on the subject of progressive food policy. For the second conference, attended by 1,000 New Yorkers, he joined with New York University and the not-for-profit Just Food to address the impact of food on the health of New York City's people and their environment. He released several policy reports on food policy, including \"Food in the Public Interest\", \"FoodStat\", and \"Red Tape, Green Vegetables\".\n\nThroughout his tenure as Borough President, Stringer supported new transportation initiatives such as bike lanes. After numerous constituent complaints, in 2010 he undertook a survey, \"Respect the Lane – Clear the Path\", a policy report analyzing bike lane safety in Manhattan. During the course of the three-day survey, a total of 1,700 infractions were witnessed. The survey found that while bike lanes have a tremendous positive impact on New York City, the lanes were being misused by all parties; pedestrians, motorists, and cyclists. Working with community leaders, elected officials, local businesses, and local residents, Stringer worked to raise awareness about bike lane safety, and recommended an \"increase in protected bicycle lanes, which are separated from traffic by a physical barrier and stepped-up patrol by traffic enforcement agents to ticket scofflaws, along with better signage,\" among other ideas.\n\nStringer led the fight in New York City against hydraulic fracturing in New York State. Stringer hosted many Manhattan Community Boards to discuss the potential problems associated with \"fracking\", such as contamination to the water supply. Stringer also released a policy report in 2009, \"Uncalculated Risk: How Plans to Drill for Gas in Upstate New York could threaten New York City's Water System\", a report highlighting the impacts of \"fracking\".\n\nOn November 6, 2008, Stringer announced his decision to seek re-election as Manhattan Borough President. His Republican opponent, David Casavis, a history professor and foreign affairs writer/commentator, got 16% of the vote on a platform to abolish the office. In an October 5, 2009 article in \"City Limits\", Stringer dismissed calls by Casavis and Mayor Michael Bloomberg to eliminate his office: \"There are people who are going to call for the elimination of the public advocate office, borough president, the City Council. There are people who believe that we should have a king system here,\" says Stringer. \"Borough presidents are part of a new era and a different kind of government. It has real responsibilities and it gives you a large footprint on the issues you get involved with. It's up to the individual to take advantage of that, that you might have an impact.\"\n\nIn Spring 2009, Stringer considered a primary challenge to incumbent U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. However, he announced in May 2009 that he would not run. In his statement he said: \"In light of President Obama's clear desire to avoid a Democratic primary in New York State, I have decided to focus on my re-election race for Manhattan Borough President and to suspend my exploratory committee and fund-raising efforts for the 2010 Senate race. I firmly believe that innovative thinking on issues like education and the urban environment must be joined with bedrock Democratic values on gun control and immigration if New York's interests are to be effectively represented in Washington.\"\n\nStringer was the Democratic nominee for New York City Comptroller in the 2013 election. He defeated former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer in the Democratic primary.\n\nStringer was considered one of several contenders for the 2013 New York City Mayoral primary before he announced in mid-November 2012 that he would instead run for city comptroller in the 2013 election. His campaign team included spokesperson Audrey Gelman, advertising agency GMMB, and pollster Mark Mellman. Stringer was challenged by former New York Governor Elliot Spitzer in the Democratic party primary. Stringer, originally thought to have the lead unopposed, trailed Spitzer in the polls until late August, when he took a two-point lead. Stringer defeated Spitzer in the September 10 primary 52%–48%. In the days prior to the Democratic primary, several media outlets published a piece describing Stringer's vote against legislation that stripped NAMBLA of its tax-exempt status.\n\nIn 2014, Stringer criticized the health department's response to complaints about rats in New York City as \"weak\".\n\nIn November 2014, Comptroller Stringer announced an initiative, on behalf of the $160 billion New York City Pension Funds, to give long-term shareholders the right to nominate their own directors at 75 U.S. companies. The \"proxy access\" initiative, known as the Boardroom Accountability Project, requests that these companies change their bylaws to allow shareholders who meet a threshold of owning three percent of a company for three or more years the right to list their director candidates, representing up to 25 percent of the board, on a given company's proxy. Proxy access is the ability for shareowners to nominate directors to run against a company's chosen slate of director candidates on the corporate ballot. The 75 proposals were filed based on three priority issues: climate change, board diversity and excessive CEO pay. Stringer called proxy access \"the defining issue for the 2015 proxy season\".\n\nIn 2017, there was no Democratic primary for the position with Stringer facing Republican Michel Faulkner in the general election.\n\nOn August 28, 2001, \"Village Voice\" political writer Wayne Barrett wrote a piece entitled, \"Mother Dearest & the Courthouse Cabal,\" in which he discussed Stringer's involvement in courtroom politics, specifically questioning how Stringer's parents had benefited financially from his political ties, and whether some of his campaign contributors had done unethical things. Barrett also raised questions about whether Acting Supreme Court judge Louis York had attempted to gain Stringer's support in his bid for a full term on the court by appointing Stringer's mother nine times as a court evaluator and conservator.\n\nBoth the \"New York Daily News\" and the \"New York Post\" have published articles calling for the borough presidencies to be eliminated. A March 15, 2009 \"Daily News\" article criticized the borough presidents for spending millions of dollars on \"pet projects\", including Stringer's \"$2 million to renovate the old High Line trestle and create an immensely popular park – and another $150,000 for a database of senior citizens\".\n\nIn July 2009, Stringer's deputy press secretary resigned under pressure after posting disparaging comments about President Obama on her Facebook page. The incident led the \"New York Post\" to ask: \"Why does Stringer need a deputy press secretary\" in addition to \"a press secretary and a communications director; what the hell do they do for a living?\"\n\nOn September 3, 2010, Stringer married Elyse Buxbaum, an arts administrator at the time, who is the deputy director of development at The Jewish Museum. The couple chose to receive a marriage license in Connecticut as a statement of solidarity with LGBT couples who had not yet been given the right to marry in New York State. They have two boys.\n\n"}
{"id": "2118562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118562", "title": "Moral economy", "text": "Moral economy\n\nA moral economy is an economy that is based on goodness, fairness, and justice, as opposed to one where the market is assumed to be independent of such concerns. The concept was an elaboration by English historian E.P. Thompson, from a term already used by various eighteenth century authors, who felt that economic and moral concerns increasingly seemed to drift apart (see Götz 2015). \n\nThompson wrote of the moral economy of the poor in the context of widespread food riots in the English countryside in the late eighteenth century. According to Thompson these riots were generally peaceable acts that demonstrated a common political culture rooted in feudal rights to \"set the price\" of essential goods in the market. These peasants held that a traditional \"fair price\" was more important to the community than a \"free\" market price and they punished large farmers who sold their surpluses at higher prices outside the village while there were still those in need within the village. In the 1970s the concept of a moral economy was developed further in anthropological studies of peasant economies. The notion of a non-capitalist cultural mentality using the market for its own ends has been linked by others (with Thompson's approval) to subsistence agriculture and the need for subsistence insurance in hard times.\nThe concept was widely popularized in anthropology through the book \"\" by James C. Scott (1976). The book begins with a telling metaphor of peasants being like a man standing up to his nose in water; the smallest wave will drown him. Similarly, peasants generally live so close to the subsistence line that it takes little to destroy their livelihoods. From this, he infers a set of economic principles that it would be rational for them to live by. It is important to emphasize that this book was not based on fieldwork, and itself proposed a cross-cultural universalistic model of peasant economic behaviour based upon a set of fixed theoretical principles, not a reading of peasant culture. Firstly, he argued that peasants were \"risk averse\", or, put differently, followed a \"safety first\" principle. They would not adopt risky new seeds or technologies, no matter how promising, because tried and true traditional methods had demonstrated, not promised, effectiveness. This gives peasants an unfair reputation as \"traditionalist\" when in fact they are just risk averse. Secondly, Scott argues that peasant society provides \"subsistence insurance\" for its members to tide them over those occasions when natural or man-made disaster strikes.\n\nA moral economy, in one interpretation, is an economy that is based on goodness, fairness, and justice. Such an economy is generally only stable in small, closely knit communities, where the principles of mutuality—i.e. \"I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine\"—operate to avoid the free rider problem. Where economic transactions arise between strangers who cannot be informally sanctioned by a social network, the free rider problem lacks a solution and a moral economy becomes harder to maintain.\n\nIn traditional societies, each person and each household is a consumer as well as a producer. Social networks create mutual understandings to promote the survival of these social units in the face of scarcity; these social ties operate to prevent the economic actors in traditional societies from behaving to maximize personal profit. Traditional understandings arise as to the relative value of various goods and services; they are not independently renegotiated for each transaction in an impersonal, anonymous market. Traditional staple foods and other goods deemed necessary for the survival of the community acquire customary prices; dearth or plenty should be shared by all. These traditional understandings acquire the force of custom, and with increased social complexity may eventually acquire the force of law.\n\n\"The Efficient Society\" by Joseph Heath discusses the nature of a moral economy in these terms, and argues that Canada has achieved the proper balance between social needs and economic freedom, and as such comes close to being a moral economy. Other economists such as John P. Powelson relate the concept of a \"moral economy\" to the balance of economic power; in their view, a moral economy is an economy in which economic factors are balanced against ethical norms in the name of social justice.\n\n\"Right Relationship\" by Brown and Garver, discusses the urgent need for achieving an economy that is recognized to be a subsidiary of the overall ecosystem of the planet. They address key questions regarding the purpose, function, appropriate size, fairness, and governance of a world economic system and propose new ideas to place our economy in correct relationship with the Earth's ecosystem. They argue that such a moral economy is essential if we are to avoid systemic collapse as our \"growth economy\" outstrips the Earth's limited ability to recycle our waste, and as the Earth's inventory of critical raw materials and minerals is used up, in the face of growing population and growing affluence within those populations.\n\nIn a related sense, \"moral economy\" is also a name given in economics, sociology and anthropology to the interplay between cultural mores and economic activity. It describes the various ways in which custom and social pressure coerce economic actors in a society to conform to traditional norms even at the expense of profit.\n\nPrior to the rise of classical economics in the eighteenth century, the economies in Europe and its North American colonies were governed by a variety of (formal and informal) regulations designed to prevent \"greed\" from overcoming \"morality\". In its most formal manifestations, examples such as the traditional Christian and Muslim prohibitions on usury represent the limits imposed by religious values on economic activity, and as such are part of the moral economy. Laws that determine what sort of contracts will be given effect by the judiciary, and what sort of contracts are void or voidable, often incorporate concepts of a moral economy; in many jurisdictions, traditionally a contract involving gambling was considered void in law because it was against public policy. These restrictions on freedom of contract are the results of moral economy. According to the beliefs which inspired these laws, economic transactions were supposed to be based on mutual obligation, not individual gain. In colonial Massachusetts, for example, prices and markets were highly regulated, even the fees physicians could charge.\n\nOther forms of moral economy are more informal. In the sixteenth and seventeenth century, for instance, clergymen often preached against various economic practices that were not strictly illegal, but were deemed to be \"uncharitable\". Their condemnations of selling food at high prices or raising rents probably influenced the behavior of many people who regarded themselves as Christian and worried about their reputations.\n\nLikewise, during the rapid expansion of capitalism over the past several centuries, the tradition of a pre-capitalist \"moral economy\" was used to justify popular action against unscrupulous merchants and traders. For example, the poor regularly rioted against grain merchants who raised their prices in years of dearth in an attempt to reassert the concept of the just price. The Marxist historian E. P. Thompson emphasized the continuing force of this tradition in his pioneering article on \"The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century\" (1971). Later historians and sociologists have uncovered the same phenomenon in a variety of other situations, including peasants' riots in continental Europe during the nineteenth century and in many developing countries in the twentieth. The political scientist James C. Scott, for example, showed how this ideology could be used as a method of resisting authority in \"\" (1976).\n\nIt must be remembered, however, that sometimes a moral economy may not act in conformity to morality as it is now generally understood. Social pressures to enforce racial segregation even when willing buyers and sellers would erode the racial barriers, are clearly an example of cultural pressures imposing economic inefficiency, and therefore fall within the purview of moral economy.\n\nIn modern times, \"utopian moral economies\" have arisen to systematically reorganize their economic system to reflect a particular moral or ethical code that rejects the free-market ethos of capitalist economies. Societies that pursue some derivative of socialism or communism are obvious examples of this impulse, along with small-scale attempts in the form of the Israeli kibbutz and the intentional communities of the 1960s and 70s.\n\nVery few of these experiments—with the possible exception of the kibbutz—turned out the way their founders had imagined. Unsurprisingly, a revolutionary reorganization of some of the most fundamental parts of society often resulted in the severe dislocation of many people's everyday lives and the loss of whole generations to schemes like Stalin's failed policy of collective farming. However, many of the small and pragmatic attempts to make the capitalist economy more moral (e.g. fair trade, moral investment funds, the development of renewable energy sources, recycling, cooperatives, etc.) have grown from the same impulse that drove the utopian revolutionaries. These developments, however, do not fully realize their intentions, being fundamentally at odds with the mechanisms in the capitalist economy, such as cyclical consumption, the inherent duplicity of goods in competition, and the process of \"externalizing\" those costs which are not directly pertinent to an actor's finances.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118565", "title": "Al-Aziz Billah", "text": "Al-Aziz Billah\n\nAbu Mansur Nizar (; 10 May 955 – 14 October 996), known by his regnal name as al-Aziz Billah (), was the fifth caliph of the Fatimid dynasty, from 975 to his death in 996.\n\nNizar, the future al-Aziz Billah, was born on 10 May 955, the third son of the fourth Fatimid Caliph, al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah (). His mother, Durzan, usually known as \"al-Sayyida al-Muʿizzīya\" (\"the Lady of al-Mu'izz\") was the chief concubine of al-Mu'izz, and likely of Bedouin origin. She was known for her beautiful singing voice, which earned her the nickname \"Taghrīd\" (\"Twitter\"). She died in 995.\n\nIn 974 his older brother Abdallah ibn al-Mu'izz —who had been the designated heir in preference to the oldest of al-Mu'izz's sons, Tamim—died, and Nizar found himself as his father's designated successor (\"walī al-ʿahd\"). The succession was not confirmed in front of the members of the dynasty and court, however, until a day before al-Mu'izz's death on 18 December 975. His official proclamation as caliph was delayed until 9 August 976.\n\nAccording to the sources, al-Aziz Billah was \"tall, with red hair and blue eyes, generous, brave, fond of horses and hunting and very humane and tolerant in disposition\". He was marked for his skill as an administrator, reforming the finances of the Fatimid state, standardizing and streamlining the payment of officials, and taking steps to ensure their integrity. At the same time, he was known for his extravagant lifestyle and obsession for precious objects and materials, rare animals and delicacies; it is said that on one occasion, he had carrier pigeons bring him cherries from Ba'albek. The Egyptian economy was also nurtured, and tax revenue thereby increased, through the expansion of streets and canals and the establishment of a stable currency. The general economic well-being was also apparent in an elaborate building programme.\n\nThe most influential official during most of his reign was Ya'qub ibn Killis, who was the first in Fatimid history to be designated as \"vizier\", in 979. Apart from two brief periods when Ibn Killis fell into disgrace—in 979 and 984—he remained al-Aziz's chief minister until his death in 991. Just like his master, Ibn Killis lived in great luxury, facilitated by a salary of 100,000 gold dinars. Ibn Killis is credited with the capable administration of the public finances, which ensured a full treasury despite the vast sums expended by the luxury-loving Caliph, but also for his role as a patron of men of letters, and the author of a book that codified Fatimid laws. In contrast, his successors did not long remain in office, and in the short space of five years, the post of vizier was occupied by six men: Ali ibn Umar al-Addas, Abu'l-Fadl Ja'far ibn al-Furat, al-Husayn ibn al-Hasan al-Baziyar, Abu Muhammad ibn Ammar, al-Fadl ibn Salih, and Isa ibn Nasturus ibn Surus.\n\nAl-Aziz also undertook major military reforms. Berbers, and especially the Kutama tribe, had traditionally provided the mainstay of the Fatimid armies, and had played the main role in the takeover of Ifriqiya and the conquest of Egypt and the southern Levant under al-Aziz's predecessors. Until the 970s, the Kutama provided the cavalry, with the infantry composed of Slavic (\"Ṣaqāliba\"), Greek (\"Rūm\") and Black African (\"Sūdān\" or \"ʿabīd\") slaves.\n\nHowever, the forays into the Levant revealed the inadequacies of an army based solely on the Kutama, and from 978, al-Aziz, began to introduce mercenaries from the Islamic East, especially Turks and Daylamites. The adoption of the \"ghilmān\" system had far-reaching repercussions, as the Turkish \"ghilmān\" assumed senior positions in the state and began to rival the Kutama for influence, especially as the flow of new recruits from the Kutama homeland ebbed after . Consequently, a fierce antagonism developed between the two groups, termed \"Maghāriba\" (\"Westerners\") and \"Mashāriqa\" (\"Easterners\") respectively, which would erupt in open warfare after al-Aziz's death.\n\nThe employment of the Christian Ibn Nesturus, just as that of the Jew Manashsha as Secretary for Syria, was a prominent example of the Fatimids' tolerance in religious matters, further encouraged under al-Aziz by his Melkite Christian wife. Two of her brothers, Orestes and Arsenius, were appointed as Patriarch of Jerusalem and metropolitan bishop of Cairo, respectively. The Coptic Christians also benefited from the Caliph's favour, allowing them to rebuilt the Saint Mercurius Church despite Muslim opposition, or refusing to punish a Muslim man who converted to Christianity. This leniency, crowned by the appointment to high office of Ibn Nesturus and Manashsha, was resented by the Muslim populace, with Muslim opinion incensed by hostile tracts circulating among them. The Caliph was briefly forced to depose his two ministers and imprison them, but soon their undoubted skill ensured their release and reinstatement. Anti-Christian animus was most evident in 996, when merchants from Amalfi were suspected of being responsible for a fire that destroyed the arsenal at Cairo; in a city-wide anti-Christian pogrom, the Amalfitans were murdered and churches were ransacked.\n\nThis tolerance did not extend towards the Sunni Muslim population, however, as al-Aziz followed a fervently Isma'ili agenda: he erected inscriptions denouncing the Companions of the Prophet, abolished the Tarawih prayers in 982, and initiated the celebration of the Ashura festival in Cairo. In 991, a man found in possession of the Sunni legal treatise \"Muwatta Imam Malik\" was executed.\n\nThe reign of Al-Aziz was also culturally significant. Ibn Killis founded the al-Azhar University in Cairo (988) which went on to become the most important centre of learning in the Islamic world. Likewise a library with 200,000 volumes was built in Cairo.\n\nAccording to Professor Samy S. Swayd Fatimid missionaries made their Dawah in China during the reign of Al-Aziz.\n\nIn foreign affairs, al-Aziz concentrated on the extension of Fatimid control over Syria, whose conquest had begun immediately after the Fatimid conquest of Egypt in 969.\n\nPossession of Syria, and particularly Palestine, was a constant foreign policy objective for many rulers of Egypt both before and after the Fatimids, to foreclose the most likely invasion route into the country by the powers of Western Asia. In the Fatimid case, this drive was given additional impetus by their ambitions to lead the entire Islamic world and unseat the Abbasid Caliphate by conquering Iraq and the eastern Islamic lands, which was possible only via Syria. At the same time, the balance of power in the region was altered with the simultaneous expansion of the Byzantine Empire into northern Syria against the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo, culminating in the capture of Antioch in 969. The Fatimids used the Byzantine advance as a major item in their propaganda, claiming to be the only power capable of championing the \"jihad\" against the \"infidel\" threat. However, Fatimid policy with regard to Syria during the early part of al-Aziz's reign was dominated by the vizier Ibn Killis, who, according to historian Hugh N. Kennedy, \"believed that the Fatimids should concentrate on controlling Palestine and southern Syria, while leaving the north of the Hamdanids and their successors to form a buffer state against the Byzantines, with whom the caliph should try to keep on good terms\".\n\nDespite initial successes, the initial Fatimid invasion of Syria, under the Kutama general Ja'far ibn Fallah, quickly came to a halt through a combination of rebellions by the citizens of Damascus and the Bedouin tribes of the Syrian Desert. In August 971, the Fatimids were defeated in battle against the Bedouin and their Qarmatian allies, leading to the near total collapse of Fatimid control in southern Syria and Palestine, and even a short-lived Qarmatian invasion of Egypt.\n\nWhen al-Aziz came to power, Damascus was ruled by the Turk Alptakin, who with only 300 of his fellow Turks had taken power by exploiting the unpopularity of the Fatimids' Kutama troops, gained popular support by restoring order in the city, and held it against the Fatimids, recognizing Abbasid suzerainty. Further south, Palestine was under Fatimid control, but the powerful Bedouin chieftain of the Banu Tayy tribe, Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah, was opposed to them and held the provincial capital Ramla.\n\nIn 975 al-'Aziz took control of Baniyas in an attempt to subdue the anti-Fatimid agitation of the Sunni \"Mahammad b. Ahmad al-Nablusi\" and his followers.\n\nIn 976, the Fatimid general Jawhar, the conqueror of Egypt, campaigned against Damascus, but after two months of clashes before the city he had to retreat due to the arrival of Alptakin's Qarmatian allies. Followed by Alptakin's forces, Jawhar was pushed back to Tiberias, Ramla and finally Ascalon, where he was besieged. The siege lasted for seventeen months and ended in early 978 with a negotiated agreement, which abandoned the entire territory from Ascalon to Damascus to Alptakin. Only Gaza remained under direct Fatimid control, although Alptakin was prepared to acknowledge the nominal suzerainty of al-Aziz over the territories he ruled. Jawhar and his men had also to undergo the humiliation of passing under a sword and lance in token of their defeat while departing Ascalon for Egypt.\n\nThe Fatimid court could not accept this humiliating agreement, which not only left Egypt vulnerable to attack, but also deprived senior members of the Fatimid elite—including Ibn Killis himself—of important properties around Damascus. As a result, al-Aziz took the field in person and, at the head of an enormous army, defeated and captured Alptakin in August 978. The Qarmatians were bribed with promises of an annual payment of tribute to retreat to Bahrayn, thus bringing an end to their incursions into Syria. The events of the previous years also demonstrated to Ibn Killis the dangers of continuing to rely on the Kutama. As a result, the Caliph unexpectedly showed clemency to Alptakin, taking him and his Turkish followers into Fatimid service. Alptakin himself was taken to Cairo, where he was lavishly honoured by the Caliph, arousing the envy of Ibn Killis, who had Alptakin poisoned. Nevertheless, as noted before, this event was of momentous importance and marked a major departure from previous Fatimid practice; especially in Syria, the Turkish \"ghilmān\" remained influential and often occupied the position of governor of Damascus.\n\nDamascus itself was taken over by one of Alptakin's lieutenants, Qassam, with the support of the local population and the city militia (\"aḥdāth\"), who wished to avoid a renewed Berber occupation. The Fatimid general al-Fadl ibn Salih, a protégé of Ibn Killis, was sent with a Berber army against Qassam, but other than a show of force against the coastal cities failed to achieve anything and retreated to Palestine. Matters became complicated with the arrival of Abu Taghlib, the ousted Hamdanid ruler of Mosul, who contacted al-Aziz with an offer to capture the city if they supported him with troops. This was opposed by Ibn al-Jarrah, who feared lest the Hamdanid and his followers form the Banu Uqayl tribe, rivals to the Tayy, threaten his own position, particularly his possession of Ramla and the pasture lands of his tribe. Al-Fadl apparently played a duplicitous game, encouraging Abu Taghlib in his designs on Ramla in an effort to sow dissension among the Arab tribes and strengthen Fatimid authority; however, in August 979, when Ibn al-Jarrah attacked Abu Taghlib and his men at Ramla, al-Fadl came to his aid with his own troops. Abu Taghlib was taken captive and executed. This battle established Ibn al-Jarrah and his Tayy as a major player in the region's power politics: despite his recognition of Fatimid suzerainty, the Tayy chieftain was a virtually independent ruler and remained a constant nuisance for the Fatimid government for decades.\nDamascus continued to resist Fatimid attempts to capture it, notably under the Kutama chieftain Sulayman ibn Ja'far ibn Fallah in 979/80, while, despite al-Fadl's efforts to use the Uqayl to contain them, the Tayy and their unchecked depradations grew to be a menace to the settled and agrigultural districts of southern Syria: Ramla was \"reduced to a ghost town\", in the words of Kennedy, and the Ghuta plain around Damascus and the Hawran region were so devastated that Damascus faced famine, alleviated only through supplies sent from Homs, ruled by the Turk Bakjur for the Hamdanids of Aleppo. As a result of the successive failures of Berber commanders to capture Damascus and restore order in the province, the Fatimid court appointed a Turk, Baltakin, a former follower of Alptakin, as commander of the next expedition into Syria. Baltakin defeated Ibn al-Jarrah, who fled north to Antioch and the protection of the Byzantines, while Qassam was finally forced to surrender Damascus in early 983, albeit under generous terms that allowed him to remain in control under a Fatimid-appointed governor.\n\nAfter securing Fatimid rule in central and southern Syria, Caliph al-Aziz aimed to capture Aleppo as well, but was restrained by Ibn Killis while he lived. The question of Aleppo was complicated, as it risked provoking a direct confrontation with Byzantium. Since 969, the Hamdanid emirate had been tributary to the Byzantines. Its ruler, Sa'd al-Dawla (), resented this dependence, but was forced to abide with it in order to prevent an outright Fatimid conquest. As a result, his policy vacillated between the two powers. Nevertheless, the Fatimids benefited from the weakness of the Hamdanids, as many Hamdanid supporters began entering Fatimid service. For example, Raja al-Siqlabi defected with 300 of his men, and was appointed governor of Acre and Caesarea.\n\nThe most important such defection was that of the Hamdanid governor of Homs, Bakjur, in 983. Bakjur contacted al-Aziz directly and offered to enter Fatimid service against Aleppo in exchange for the governorship of Damascus. Attracted by the possibility of taking over not only Homs but possibly Aleppo as well, al-Aziz agreed to Bakjur's offer over the vehement opposition of Ibn Killis, who was briefly deposed and imprisoned in conjunction with a harvest failure that led to famine in the capital. The Caliph provided Bakjur with an army, with which he attacked Aleppo in September. Sa'd al-Dawla was forced to appeal to the Byzantine emperor Basil II () for help, who sent his general Bardas Phokas the Younger to assist Aleppo. Forewarned of the Byzantines' approach by the exiled Ibn al-Jarrah, Bakjur raised the siege and fled to Fatimid territory. The Byzantines proceeded to sack Homs in October, and returned the city to Hamdanid control. In 987/8, a seven-year truce was concluded with the Byzantines. It stipulated an exchange of prisoners, the recognition of the Byzantine emperor as protector of Christians under Fatimid rule and of the Fatimid Caliph as protector of Muslims under Byzantine control, and the replacement of the name of the Abbasid caliph with that of the Fatimid caliph in the Friday prayer in the mosque at Constantinople.\n\nDespite his failure, Bakjur was named governor of Damascus by al-Aziz, and was joined by Ibn al-Jarrah. Ibn Killis, who was released and restored to his office after barely two months, immediately began working against the two. Bakjur gradually made himself unpopular to the Damascenes due to his cruelty, and after several failed efforts, in 989 Ibn Killis finally persuaded al-Aziz to replace Bakjur with one of the vizier's personal \"ghilmān\", Ya'qub al-Siqlabi. Bakjur fled to Raqqa, from where he continued his unsuccessful attacks on Aleppo. At the same time, Baltakin was sent to pacify the Bedouin tribes who were raiding the Hajj caravans, leading to the establishment of a Fatimid garrison at Wadi al-Qura, north of Medina.\n\nIbn Killis' death in 991 freed al-Aziz to pursue a more aggressive stance in the Aleppo question. Immediately he dismissed Ibn Killis' protégé and appointed the Turk Manjutakin as governor of Damascus. Manjutakin's use of Damascus as his base during the subsequent campaigns shows the consolidation of Fatimid control in the area, but also, as Hugh Kennedy remarks, the changes it brought to the \"political and economic geography of Syria\": given the continued insecurity of the overland routes due to the depredations of the Bedouin, the Fatimids supplied their forces in Syria by sea—notably via Tripoli—and as a result the chief coastal towns rose in importance, as centres of Fatimid control and administration as well as commerce, experiencing a revival which continued into the 12th century.\n\nManjutakin invaded the Hamdanid emirate, defeated a Byzantine force under the \"doux\" of Antioch, Michael Bourtzes, in June 992, and laid siege to Aleppo. However, he failed to pursue the siege with vigour and the city was easily able to resist until, in the spring of 993, after thirteen months of campaigning, Manjutakin was forced to return to Damascus due to lack of supplies. In spring 994, Manjutakin launched another invasion, again defeated Bourtzes at the Battle of the Orontes in September and again besieged Aleppo. The blockade was far more effective this time and soon caused a severe lack of food, but the city's defenders held out until the sudden arrival of the Byzantine emperor, Basil II, in person in April 995. Basil crossed Asia Minor in only sixteen days at the head of an army; his sudden arrival, and the exaggerated numbers circulating for his army, caused panic in the Fatimid army. Manjutakin burned his camp and retreated to Damascus without giving battle.\n\nThe Byzantines besieged Tripoli but failed to capture it; nevertheless, the Fatimids lost control of the city, which became independent under its \"qadi\". The Byzantine emperor then occupied and fortified Tartus. Al-Aziz himself now prepared to take the field against the Byzantines himself, beginning large-scale preparations at Cairo. Byzantine and Hamdanid embassies carrying proposals for a truce were received in September 995, but rejected. Al-Aziz's preparations were set back when the fleet being prepared at Cairo was destroyed by a fire, which set off an anti-Christian pogrom in the city. Manjutakin was ordered to recapture Tartus, but its Armenian garrison was able to fend off his attacks; and a Fatimid fleet sent to assist the siege was lost in a storm off the coast. Al-Aziz died on 14 October 996, before setting out on his campaign. The Byzantine–Fatimid conflict continued under his successor until the conclusion of a ten-year truce in 1000.\n\nAlong with Syria, al-Aziz presided over an expansion of Fatimid influence in the Arabian peninsula. The Hajj—at least those caravans setting off from Cairo with the pilgrims of the western Islamic world—was placed under Fatimid control and protection, despite the considerable cost. The emirs of Mecca, although \"de facto\" autonomous, recognized the Fatimids' suzerainty, in token of which the Fatimids enjoyed the prestigious privilege of furnishing each year the new cover of the Kaaba (the \"kiswa\"). Finally, in 992 the Fatimids were acknowledged as caliphs in the Yemen, and even their old enemies, the Qarmatians of Bahrayn, came around to acknowledge their claims. According to Kennedy, these diplomatic victories were the result of the more energetic foreign policy pursued by al-Aziz, particularly after the death of Ibn Killis, which bolstered his credentials by demonstrating \"his ability and willingness to undertake the two major public responsibilities of a caliph, to safeguard the Hajj and to lead the Muslims against the infidel Byzantines\".\n\nOn the other hand, North Africa, including the former Fatimid heartland of Ifriqiya, was mostly neglected. Effective power there had passed to the Zirid viceroy of Ifriqiya, Buluggin ibn Ziri (), who was confirmed in office by al-Aziz, as was his son al-Mansur (). In 992, al-Aziz even confirmed al-Mansur's son Badis as heir-apparent, thereby strengthening the Zirids' claim to dynastic succession. Indeed, as Kennedy remarks, \"nothing is more striking than the speed with which [the Fatimids] were prepared to allow North Africa to go its own way\"; apart from diplomatic exchanges of gifts, the Zirids governed their domains increasingly independently from the Fatimid court, even to the point of warring with the Kutama, the erstwhile mainstay of the Fatimid regime. In a similar manner, al-Aziz contended himself with recognizing the succession of the Kalbid emirs of Sicily after the event. Nearer to Egypt, the governor of Barqa (Cyrenaica) is known to have brought presents to the court of Cairo, but otherwise there are no indications of the Fatimids' exercising any control over him.\n\nAl-Aziz died on 13 October 996. His son Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (996-1021) succeeded him as Caliph.\n\nInformation about al-Aziz's consorts is unclear. His oldest surviving child was a daughter, Sitt al-Mulk, born in 970. Her mother is designated as an \"umm walad\" in the sources, indicating that at some point she also bore al-Aziz a son, who apparently died in infancy. She is commonly identified with the \"Sayyida al-ʿAzīzīya\" (\"the Lady of Aziz\") who is frequently mentioned in the sources, and died in 995. In 979, al-Aziz married a cousin of his (the precise relation is unknown). He also had a third wife, a Byzantine Greek Christian, who was the mother of his successor, al-Hakim.\n\n\n"}

His lucid style of explaining hard science has frequently been imitated by later popular science presenters in Germany.\n\nAfter studying physics in Leipzig, Heidelberg and Berlin and obtaining his doctorate, Haber served in World War II for the German Luftwaffe as a reconnaissance aviator until 1942. He returned to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik, where he headed a small Potsdam-based division constructing a diffraction spectrograph.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Heinz Haber — as well as several other Germans involved in military research like Wernher von Braun — was targeted by the Operation Paperclip with the aim of denying scientific expertise and knowledge to the Soviet Union and bringing researchers and scientists to the United States; Ultimately this operation resulted in a considerable contribution to the development of NASA. Haber at first stayed in the American occupied zone of Germany and lectured at Heidelberg. However, in 1946, he emigrated to the United States and joined the USAF School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Air Force Base. Together with fellow German Hubertus Strughold, he and his brother Dr. Fritz Haber (April 3, 1912 – August 21, 1998) made pioneering research into space medicine in the late 1940s. The brothers proposed parabolic flights for simulating weightlessness.\n\nIn 1952, he became associate physicist at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA); in the 1950s, Haber eventually became the chief scientific consultant to Walt Disney productions. He later co-hosted Disney’s \"Man in Space\" with von Braun. When the Eisenhower administration asked Disney to produce a show championing the civilian use of nuclear power, Heinz Haber was given the assignment. He hosted the Disney broadcast called \"Our Friend the Atom\" and wrote a popular children’s book with the same title, both of which explained nuclear fission and fusion in simple terms. General Dynamics, a manufacturer of nuclear reactors, sponsored \"Our Friend the Atom\" and the nuclear submarine ride at Disneyland’s Tomorrowland.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, he was known in Germany as a popular science spokesperson and wrote magazine columns and numerous books and presented his own TV programs like \"Professor Haber experimentiert\", \"Das Mathematische Kabinett\", \"Unser blauer Planet\", \"Stirbt unser blauer Planet?\", \"Professor Haber berichtet\", and \"WAS IST WAS mit Professor Haber\". He was founding editor of the German science magazine \"Bild der Wissenschaft\" from 1964 to 1990. His memorable experiments included one where the onset of a nuclear chain reaction was simulated with hundreds of mousetraps, each one having been loaded with two ping pong balls.\n\nHeinz Haber had two children, Kai (born 1943) and Cathleen (born 1945), from his first marriage, and a third child, Marc (born 1969), from the second. His first wife Anneliese lives in Tucson, Arizona, his second wife Irmgard in Hamburg, Germany.\n\n\n"}

Currently, he is professor of religions of India at Rutgers University. He published seven books and authored a number of articles on Vedic history, \"yoga\", and the Krishna tradition. In his research engagements, he lived several years in India where he studied Sanskrit and was trained with several Indian pundits.\n\nEdwin Bryant received his Ph.D in Indic languages and Cultures from Columbia University in 1997 with a dissertation on the \"Indigenous Aryans Debate\". He taught Hinduism at Harvard University for three years, and is presently professor of Religions of India at Rutgers University where he teaches courses on Hindu philosophy and religion. He has received numerous fellowships.\n\nIn addition to his academic courses, Bryant currently teaches workshops at yoga studios and teacher training courses throughout the country. His lectures and workshop engagements include: The Bhagavad Gita, The Yoga Sutras, Indian Philosophy and Bhakti, and the Krishna Tradition. Indian Philosophy workshop includes \"the foundational philosophical texts of yoga and examine the underpinnings and essential principles of the classical schools of Hindu philosophy... beginning with their foundations in the Upanishads, the earliest mystico-philosophical tradition of India, and evolving into the Yoga Sutras, Vedanta Sutras, Bhagavad Gita, and other post-Vedic texts.\"\n\nBryant has published seven books and authored a number of articles on Vedic history, yoga, and Krishna-bhakti tradition. He is an expert on Krishna tradition and has translated the story of Krishna from the Sanskrit \"Bhagavata Purana\".\n\nBryant is the author of \"The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture\" (Oxford University Press, 2001).\n\nJ. P. Mallory says the book: \nMichael Witzel writes:\n\nThis book, edited by Edwin Bryant and Laurie Patton, contains a series of articles by proponents of the \"Indigenous Aryans\" position and scholars of the Indo-Aryan migration theory, with some alternative interpretations. According to Edwin Bryant, most of the evidence regarding the origin of Indo-Aryans is inconclusive and he is not convinced of the Indo-Aryan migrations theory, but he is also not convinced of an \"Out-of-India position\", since the support for it is not significant. He notes that the discovery of Indo-Aryan language family was foundational to the investigation of the origins of the Western civilization, and the relationship between the Indo-Aryan family and the remaining Indo-European languages must be established. However, he states: \"... I find most of the evidence that has been marshalled to support the theory of Indo-Aryan migrations into the subcontinent to be inconclusive upon careful scrutiny, but on the other, I have not been convinced by an Out-of-India position, since there has been very little of significance offered so far in support of it.\"\n\nIn a review, Sanskrit linguist Stephanie W. Jamison likened the effort of the volume to calls to \"teach the controversy\" by the proponents of Intelligent Design. She states that the Indo-Aryan controversy is a \"manufactured one\" with a non-scholarly, religio-nationalistic attack on scholarly consensus and the editors (Bryant and Patton) have unwittingly provided it a gloss of intellectual legitimacy. The editors are not linguists, she contends, and they have accepted patently weak or false linguistic arguments. So their apparently even-handed assessment lacks merit and cannot be regarded as objective scholarship. Historian Sudeshna Guha concurs, saying that Bryant does not probe into the epistemology of evidence and hence perceives the opposing viewpoints unproblematic. On the contrary, she holds that the timing and renewed vigour of the indigenist arguments during the 1990s demonstrates unscholarly opportunism. Fosse and Deshpande's contributions to the volume provide a critical analysis of the historiography and the nationalist and colonial agendas behind it. She also holds Bryant's desire to present what he calls the views of \"Indian scholars\" for \"reconstructing the religious and cultural history of their own country\" as misleading because it patently ignores the views of historians of India who have done so since the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\nIn 2007 Bryant completed a translation of the \"Yoga Sutras\" and their traditional commentaries. The translation was published in 2009 by North Point Press as \"The Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali (with Insights from the Traditional Commentators).\" In his article \"History Repeats Itself\" (Yoga Journal, Nov 2001), the author adds that \"Our modern world, more than any other epoch in human history, has universalized and idolized consumerism - the indulgence of the senses of the mind - as the highest goal of life.\" In yoga, that creates unwanted influences, where \"Our vrittis, the turbulences of the mind born from desire, are out of control.\" Control and elimination of \"vrittis\" comprise significant portion of yoga practices and observances (\"yama\" and \"niyama\") that culminates with nirodha, an arrested state of mind capable of one-pointedness. Otherwise, if unwanted \"vrittis\" are allowed to predominate, \"We risk missing the whole point of the practice\".\n\nIn the interview \"Inside the Yoga Tradition\", Bryant describes some tenets of his interpretation of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, \"I stress in my commentary that Patanjali is emphatic about the \"yamas\" and \"niyamas\" (vows and observances). We can't say that what he is teaching is applicable only to the time period in which he codified the Sutras or that they are only for Hindus living in India. Patanjali asserts that \"yamas\" and \"niyamas\" are great universal vows. He didn't have to further qualify them - universal means no exception whatsoever.\"\n\nDiscussing theistic overtones in \"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\" and the practice of \"ishvara-pranidhana\" (commitment or surrender to God), David Gordon White points out in his \"The Yoga Sutra of Patanjali - A Biography\", \"Edwin Bryant, who, in his recent splendid commentary on the Yoga Sutra, notes that Vijanabhikshu considered \"ishvara-pranidhana\" to refer to the practice of devotion to Krishna, the Lord of the \"Bhagavat Gita\". Bryant clearly aligns himself with this interpretation of the term, reading \"ishvara-pranidhana\" as submission to a personal god and asserting that most yogis over the past two millennia have been associated with devotional sects.\" Similar view is expressed by a commentator of \"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (1999)\", Baba Hari Dass, \"\"Ishvara pranidhana\" (surrender to God) is a method of the devotional path (Bhakti Yoga)\". Due to its ultimate intensity, this practice is considered to be a fast-track to Samadhi (super-consciousness).\n\n\n\n"}

The vessel was named after the brightest star in the Orion constellation. The ships had been requisitioned by the German occupation authorities in Norway in 1940 to transport Allied PoWs.\n\nAccording to Norwegian sources \"Rigel\", under the command of Captain Heinrich Rhode with a German crew, sailed under the German flag from Bjerkvik on 21 November 1944 carrying 951 PoWs and 114 guards. At Narvik a further 349 PoWs were loaded plus 95 German deserters and 8 Norwegian prisoners arrested by the German police. The ship then proceeded in convoy with some smaller vessels to Tømmerneset where 948 more PoWs were loaded into the cargo holds. \"Rigel\" called next at the port of Bodø.\n\nWhen the ship left Bodø on 26 November Captain Rhode reported 2838 persons on board. There were 2,248 Soviet, Polish and Serbian prisoners of war with the 95 German deserters and 8 Norwegian prisoners. In addition there were 455 German soldiers and the normal ship's crew of 29 plus three coastal pilots. One of the pilots and one woman crew member were Norwegians. \n\nThe convoy, escorted by two small V-Boats of the Kriegsmarine, was discovered by a patrol from the aircraft carrier on the morning of 27 November, which mistakenly identified \"Rigel\" as a troopship. With many people on deck the vessel probably looked like a troopship to the attackers. The convoy was attacked by Supermarine Seafire fighters and Fairey Firefly dive-bombers from \"Implacable\", which was taking part in Operation Provident. The attack took place between the islands of Rosøya and Tjøtta south of the port of Sandnessjøen in Nordland county.\n\nAfter the attack the German captain grounded the badly damaged \"Rigel\" on the island of Rosøya, which probably saved the lives of the 267 survivors. The number of casualties is 2571, including seven Norwegians. \n\nAlso heavily damaged and grounded was the collier \"Korsnes\", built in 1936 for the Bergen company Kr. Jebsen. There were six casualties on this ship, which was salvaged in 1946 and continued in use until 1965.\n\nThe wreck remained half-sunk until 1969, when it was demolished and the remains of the dead buried in the Tjøtta International War Cemetery on the island of Tjøtta. The cemetery was consecrated in 1970, in memory of those killed on the \"Rigel\". All the graves are anonymous, but a memorial stone in the form of a cross has been erected on the site.\n\nAlso in 1970, a song (\"Riegal\") based on the story of the \"Rigel\" was released by the American psychedelic folk group Pearls Before Swine on their album \"The Use of Ashes\".\n\nThe Norwegian broadcaster NRK produced a short news video in 2004 to mark the 60th anniversary of the disaster, with an interview with one of the survivors, 83-year-old Asbjørn Schultz. Three weeks later, having told his story, Schultz died. The video contains some underwater footage of the wreck. In a radio broadcast in 1966 Schultz said that the convoy had come under attack at about 11.00 by about 40 aircraft. Many prisoners escaped from the ship only to drown while trying to reach land, he said.\n"}

The Nazi Party made significant gains and became the largest party in the Reichstag for the first time, although they failed to win a majority.\n\nSince 1929, Germany had been suffering from the Great Depression; unemployment had risen from 8.5% to nearly 30% between 1929 and 1932, while industrial production dropped by around 42%. In March 1930, the governing grand coalition of the pro-republican parties (the Social Democratic Party (SPD), Centre Party and both liberal parties) collapsed. Hindenburg appointed a minority government, headed by the Centre Party's Heinrich Brüning, which could only govern by using Hindenburg's emergency powers. The September 1930 elections produced a highly fragmented Reichstag, making the formation of a stable government impossible. The elections also saw the Nazi Party rise to national prominence, gaining 95 seats.\n\nBrüning's policies, implemented via presidential decree and tolerated by parliament, failed to solve the economic crisis but weakened the parliamentary system. In March 1932, presidential elections pitted the incumbent Hindenburg, supported by pro-democratic parties, against Hitler and the Communist Ernst Thälmann. Hitler received around a third of the vote and was defeated in the second round in April by Hindenburg, who won a narrow majority. However, at the end of May 1932, Hindenburg was persuaded to dismiss Brüning as chancellor and replaced him with Franz von Papen, a renegade from the Centre Party, and a non-partisan \"Cabinet of Barons\". Papen's cabinet had almost no support in the Reichstag. Only three days after his appointment, he was faced with the opposition and had Hindenburg dissolve the Reichstag and called for new elections for 31 July so that the Reichstag could not dismiss him immediately.\n\nThe election campaign took place under violent circumstances, as Papen lifted the token ban on the SA, the Nazi paramilitary, which Brüning had put in place during the last days of his administration. That inevitably led to clashes with the Communist paramilitary.\n\nThe elections resulted in significant gains by the Nazi Party; with 230 seats, it became the largest party in parliament for the first time, but lacked an overall majority. Neither the Nazi Party nor Hindenburg had a governing majority, and the other parties refused to co-operate, meaning no coalition government with a majority could be formed. Papen's minority government continued in office, leading to another early election in November.\n\n"}

Since 2011 the school has been awarded status as an academy school. Entry is by examination at 11, although entry may be made in later years or most commonly at sixth form level.\n\nThe school opened in 1958. Before this time, academically able girls in Stratford had no hope of an education beyond comprehensive level, unless their parents could afford to send them to the King's High School For Girls in nearby Warwick. The Hugh Clopton School for Girls was given a Grammar Stream as the result of the 1944 Education Act. It was one of only two bilateral Schools in Warwickshire. The first and second intakes took the External School Certificate and after that when O and A Levels came into force, these were taken as a matter of course. Thanks to the sustained efforts of several women, including the first Headmistress Miss E.B. Williams, (Miss Williams was appointed Head of the bi-lateral school) the first pupils were taken from the A stream of nearby Hugh Clopton School, known today as Stratford High School. In August 2011 the school changed to Academy (Mainstream Converter) status and changed its official name from Stratford-upon-Avon Grammar School for Girls to Stratford Girls' Grammar School. The name \"Shottery\", as the school is often known, came later when there were too many pupils to be accommodated in the old building. , the school admits around 120 new Year 7 pupils per year. Competition for places is high, with more than seven applicants per place.\n\nThe original school was centred on the historic Shottery Manor, parts of which date from the 14th century. The Manor still stands today, and is used as a sixth form centre. Three additional buildings were added before the school opened, in what were originally the Manor orchards and flower gardens. The Garrett Teaching block was expanded in work that was completed in 2013.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118603", "title": "Backbreaker", "text": "Backbreaker\n\nA backbreaker refers to professional wrestling moves which see a wrestler dropping an opponent so that the opponent's back impacts or is bent backwards against a part of the wrestler's body, usually the knee. The standard version of the move sees the wrestler scoop their opponent horizontally before dropping to one knee, slamming the opponent's back on their other knee.\n\nThis backbreaker submission, better known as a Torture Rack and simply known as a backbreaker rack, sees the attacking wrestler place his/her opponent face-up across the wrestler's own shoulders before hooking the head with one hand and a leg with the other to then pull down on both ends to flex the opponent's back.\n\nThe Argentine backbreaker drop variation of this submission move sees the attacking wrestler first hold an opponent up for the Argentine backbreaker rack before dropping to the mat in a sitting or kneeling position, thus flexing the opponent's back with the impact of the drop. Another version sees the wrestler hold their opponent in the Argentine backbreaker rack before dropping into a sitting or kneeling position while simultaneously throwing the opponent off their shoulders, causing the opponent to roll in midair and fall to the mat in a face-down position. Nikki Bella has used both variations as a finisher in WWE.\n\nA variation of the Argentine backbreaker rack, known as La Reienera, sees the opponent held across the wrestler's back rather than his shoulders/neck. Often set up by a tilt-a-whirl, the opponent ends up suspended with one arm hooked behind him and both legs hooked by the wrestler's other arm.\n\nAnother variation, sometimes known as the \"Accordion Rack\" sees the opponent head behind the head of the wrestler and bending their opponent, sometimes to where their feet would touch their head, however this is mainly limited to opponents of great flexibility. This was utilized by wrestlers like Awesome Kong.\n\nRoderick Strong's variation is where he dropped his opponent with both knees as the \"Strong Breaker II\".\n\nA backbreaker move in which the wrestler lifts an opponent up into an Argentine backbreaker or an overhead gutwrench backbreaker rack, so the opponent's back is resting on the wrestler's shoulder, with the opponent's head pointing in the direction that the wrestler is facing. The attacking wrestler then drops to a kneeling or sitting position while maintaining the hold, thus jarring the back of the opponent by driving the opponent's spine into the attacking wrestler's shoulder.\n\nThe wrestler stands behind his opponent and puts his head under the arm of the opponent, as for a belly-to-back suplex, but raises a knee, and brings the opponent back down, so that the opponent's back collides with the knee of the wrestler.\n\nAlso known technically as the overhead gutwrench backbreaker rack, this sees an attacking wrestler first lifts an opponent up so the opponent's back is resting on the wrestler's shoulder, with the opponent's head pointing in the direction that the wrestler is facing. While being held face up across the wrestler's shoulder, the wrestler then links his/her arms around the opponent's torso and presses down, squeezing the opponent's spine against the wrestler's shoulder. A common variant of this hold has the attacking wrestler also apply a double underhook before or after lifting the opponent, this was used by Colt Cabana as the \"Colt .45\". The double underhook variant is often seen when the hold is used to transition to another maneuver, such as a backbreaker drop or inverted powerbomb. Bruno Sammartino famously used this move on his opponents.\n\nThe catapult throw typically starts with an opponent on his/her back, and the attacking wrestler standing and facing him/her. The wrestler hooks each of the opponent's legs in one of his/her arms then falls backwards to slingshot the opponent into a turnbuckles, ladders, ropes etc. At this point the attacking wrestler will remain on the ground and raise his knees while still holding the opponent's legs. The rebounding opponent will instantly trip falling backwards onto the raised knees of the wrestler. Another method is that the wrestler performs a catapult and raises the knees prematurely so that the wrestler is draped over the knees without an actual launch.\n\nThe wrestler performing the move stands in front of and slightly to the left of the opponent receiving it. The wrestler then reaches out and grabs the opponent's throat and trunks, and lifts him or her in the air as though the wrestler is about to deliver a chokeslam. However, as the wrestler brings the opponent back down to the mat the wrestler kneels, slamming the other wrestler's back onto his extended knee. This move is popularly known as a chokebreaker, which is a portmanteau of this move's technical name.\n\nThis move involves an attacking wrestler first putting an opponent in a cobra clutch hold before then lifting the opponent up while maintaining the hold (turning them in mid-air so they are horizontal) and bringing them down while the wrestler drops to a knee so that the opponent impacts back-first on the knee of the attacking wrestler. All while the wrestler continues to maintain the hold. The attacking wrestler can maintain the hold after impact for a cobra clutch submission attempt.\n\nAlso known as a lung blower, backstabber or backcracker, this technique involves an attacking wrestler going behind an opponent and putting both of their hands round an opponent's head for a rear chin lock or on both of the opponent's shoulders while jumping up to place both his/her knees against the opponent's back; both wrestlers then fall backward to the ground, forcing the wrestler's knees to push up into the back of the opponent. This move can be done from a variety of transition holds, including a powerbomb transition and a vertical suplex transition.\n\nAn attacking wrestler stands facing a bent over opponent and hooks each of the opponent's arms behind the opponent's back, he then lifts the opponent as if executing a Tiger Bomb. However, as the attacker drops the opponent back down, he raises a knee and brings the opponent back down horizontally so their back collides with the knee of the attacking wrestler. CM Punk used this move calling it the \"Welcome to Chicago Motherfucker\".\n\nThe attacker lifts the opponent on his shoulders in a fireman's carry then flips them over so their back lands on the top of the head, a variation to this move is performed similar to how an Ushigoroshi is performed instead a knee to the upper back.\n\nThe attacking wrestler stands behind the opponent and locks him/her in a full nelson before then lifting the opponent, as if to perform a full nelson slam, but as the wrestler drops down the opponent, he exposes a knee, slamming the opponent back-first against the exposed knee.\n\nThe attacking wrestler stands behind the opponent and locks in a half nelson before then lifting the opponent, as if to perform a half nelson slam, but as the wrestler brings the opponent down to the mat he/she drops to one knee slamming the opponent's back across the extended knee.\n\nThis move is performed behind the opponent, the wrestler grabs his/her opponent by the hair (or by the head in case if wrestler's bald or if performing wrestler is a clean performer) and pulls them back, so the opponent's back lands on the wrestler's knee. Another variation of this move is the wrestler faces the opponent, grabs them by the hair and twists round so the wrestler and opponent are back to back, and then the wrestler pulls the opponent's hair down, driving their back into the wrestler's knee. Katie Lea Burchill used both variations as her finisher. Michelle McCool used this move as a finisher called \"Final Exam\". Alexa Bliss also uses this move.\n\nUsed by Randy Orton. This move sees the attacking wrestler stands behind the opponent and places one arm around the opponent's neck, the attacker then turns 180° so they are back to back. The attacker then bends forward pulling the opponent across his own back, before dropping down to his knees and jarring the back of the opponent.\n\nCan be also known as an inverted three-quarter facelock neckbreaker or more commonly known as neckbreaker (slam) backbreaker. The wrestler stands beside the opponent facing his either sides, catches the opponent's neck from behind with both his hands (as seen primarily before falling into a neckbreaker slam), and then forces the opponent's neck down and simultaneously extending a knee so he lands his opponent's back into the knee.\n\nThe attacking wrestler stands behind an opponent, grabbing them by their head or hair to seemingly perform a standard mat slam. However, as the wrestler pulls the opponent backwards down to the mat, the wrestler kneels down, driving the opponent's back into the wrestler's exposed knee. If the wrestler uses the opponent's hair to pull them back onto the wrestler's exposed knee it is known as a hair pull backbreaker.\n\nThis basic backbreaker involves a wrestler standing side-to-side and slightly behind, with the opponent facing in the same direction, then reaching around the opponent's torso with one arm across the opponent's chest and under both arms and places the other arm under the opponent's legs, as if he was performing a sidewalk slam. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up, bringing his/her legs off the ground, and dropping him/her back-first against the wrestler's knee. The pendulum backbreaker can also be done by spinning around and then dropping the opponent onto the knee.\n\nThis basic backbreaker submission involves the wrestler to lay his opponent's back across one of his knees, then while placing one hand on his opponent's chin and the other on their knee the wrestler would push down to bend the opponent around his/her knee. This move is usually performed at the end of a pendulum backbreaker, a move which sees a wrestler drop an opponent down on the wrestler's knee, thus weakening the back before the hold is applied, as well as setting the opponent in a proper position.\n\nThis backbreaker variation sees the wrestler standing beside the opponent and slightly behind him. Then, he wraps his arm around the opponent's back-neck, and then from the point he catches the opponent's neck, he forces the opponent down in a Russian legsweep style and simultaneously extends a knee. The maneuver results in the opponent's neck or back to be slammed against the wrestler's knee.\n\nThe wrestler first stands side-to-side and slightly behind with the opponent, facing in the opposite direction before next reaching around the opponent's torso with one arm across the opponent's chest and under both arms, lifting him or her in the air as though the wrestler is about to deliver a side slam. However, as the wrestler brings the opponent back down to the mat the attacking wrestler kneels, slamming the opponent's back across his/her extended knee. This type of variation is used by Sheamus, dubbed the \"Irish Curse\".\nA swinging side slam variation sees the attacking wrestler first scoop the opponent horizontally across their chest before swinging them to their side and dropping the opponent back first on their knee.\n\nThe attacking wrestler stands facing the opponent, then puts one of their arms across the opponents chest holding their shoulder, the attacking wrestler then sweeps the legs of the opponent in the fashion of an STO, but brings their knee forward so the opponent falls back first on to it. There is also an arm trap version that sees an attacking wrestler take hold of an arm of an opponent and then move to a slightly front to back position, so that the opponent's arm hooks across and round the opponent's own head. At this point, the attacking wrestler kneels forward to the ground, forcing the opponent's own arm to drag them to the attacker's exposed knee.\n\nThe attacking wrestler stands facing the opponent, who is often charging at the attacker, before bending the opponent down so they are bent in front of the attacking wrestler as he/she stands over them then the wrestler reaches around the opponent's body and lifts them up, spinning the opponent in front of the wrestler's body. As the wrestler brings the opponent back down to the mat the wrestler kneels, slamming the opponent's back across the extended knee. In Lucha Libre, it is known as the \"Quebradora Con Giro.\"\n\n"}

Mamodos are beings from another world with supernatural powers. The series begins when Kiyo, by the request of his father, is told to take care of Zatch. Eventually, they become involved in a tournament between Mamodos where the winner becomes king of the Mamodo World.\n\nKiyo and Zatch were based on the design of a normal high school student and a noble knight who combats evil. The knight however was changed into a cuter character. In the Zatch Bell! character popularity polls, Kiyo and Zatch are voted one of the most popular characters ranking in the top three. Plush dolls based on Zatch's appearance have also been made.\n\nAfter Raiku's \"Newtown Heroes\" series in the \"Shōnen Sunday Super\" ended, Raiku looked at his old drafts he created in the past for an idea for his next series. One of his ideals was a mercenary who uses a giant sword to defeat enemies. After playing with that idea for three months, Raiku decided to abandon it and go with another idea. His next idea was a story where a middle school student, the prototype of Kiyo, finds an old toy and with the help of a noble knight, combats evil. After taking this up with his editor, he was advised to use a cuter character to fight resulting in Zatch's creation. After Raiku worked on the idea for month, it was published. The reason Zatch uses lightning spells is because his name had the word \"Rai\", which means \"lightning\" in Japanese.\n\nKiyo Takamine is a genius 14-year-old junior high school student with an IQ of over 180. His intelligence makes him a target for teasing and harassment causing him to develop an introverted and apathetic demeanor to the point where he skips school on a regular basis. However, his entire lifestyle changes when Zatch Bell arrives in his life. Due to Zatch's influence, Kiyo becomes more outgoing and eventually becomes popular in his class. Kiyo still has a bad temper and is easily irritated, often venting his frustrations on Zatch or his ditzy classmate Suzy Mizuno.\n\nZatch is an overly cheerful boy who possesses a strong sense of justice, but is clueless about most of the world around him and often gets in trouble when not being supervised by someone. Kiyo makes Zatch a toy named Volcun 300 which he refers to as a friend. Zatch's favorite food is Yellowtail, which he prefers to eat whole. When Zatch arrived to the Human world, he lived in a forest until the day Zeno attacked Zatch and removed his memory of the Mamodo world. Kiyo's father finds him and sends him to Kiyo. During the progress of the series, it is revealed Zatch is empowered with the power of \"Bao\", a powerful dragon created by Zatch's father during the last Mamodo battle. Due to the danger of \"Bao\" and Zatch's father's declining health, he transferred Bao into Zatch in order to prevent it from escaping and wreaking havoc in the Mamodo world. He soon sent Zatch to live as a normal Mamodo so he may never discover the power of Bao.\n\nKiyo's high intelligence and quick decision making makes him an excellent tactician which allowed Zatch to defeat Mamodos much stronger than him. During the battle within Faudo, Kiyo gained an ability called from being killed and subsequently brought back to life. This ability grants Kiyo the ability to know the answer to any question. Using the ability of Answer Talker in battle allows Kiyo to completely understand an opponent's attack, how to evade it, and how to effectively counterattack. Most of Zatch's spells causes Zatch to lose consciousness when cast. To get around this, Kiyo devised a method of reciting spells by training Zatch to look in the direction Kiyo points to.\nZatch's primary offense at first is the spell , which causes him to fire lightning from his mouth. During the course of the series, more powerful variations of Zaker are used in the order of , , and . Zatch's most powerful spell is which conjures a giant electrical dragon. He later gains varieties of \"Bao Zakeruga\" such as which conjures a giant claw which conjures a serpentine \"Bao Zakeruga\" which attacks by shooting its scales, and , a manifestation of electricity in the form of a giant Lernaean Hydra.\n\nZatch also gains a wide range of versatile spells to assist in situations. erects a giant shield that reflect attacks back to the source while also adding electricity to the reflected attack, creates a ball of electricity that magnetizes anything following immediate contact, amplifies Zatch's physical attributes, to guide and increase the powers of Zatch's electrical spells, and generates a huge ball of electricity capable of deflecting attacks and attracting the enemy into its epicenter where they are electrocuted.\n\nKiyo's father sends amnesic Zatch to live with him where he discovers that reading a spell from Zatch's book causes lightning to come out of Zatch's mouth. Kiyo soon learns that Zatch is a Mamodo and is one of the one-hundred Mamodo candidates in the Mamodo Battles where the remaining Mamodo who has their book intact shall become the king of the Mamodo world and thus forcing Kiyo and Zatch to fend off attacks by other Mamodos. As the series progresses, Kiyo and Zatch befriend a Mamodo named Kolulu who reveals that the Mamodo King forced her into the tournament. Zatch upon hearing her story strives to become the Mamodo King in order to bring peace to the Mamodo World. During the course of the story, Kiyo and Zatch befriend a super star named Parco Folgore and his Mamodo Kanchomé, an idol singer named Megumi Oumi and her Mamodo partner Tia, a Chinese girl named Li-en and her Mamodo Wonrei, a genius magician named Dr. Riddles and his Mamodo Kido, and later, a German man named Kafk Sunbeam and his Mamodo Ponygon. An evil Mamodo named Zofis antagonists Kiyo and his friends prompting them to defeat him and prevent him from being the Mamodo King.\n\nAfter Zofis' defeat, a group of Mamodos plan to awaken the giant Mamodo Faudo and use its power to win the Mamodo battles. Kiyo and his friends realize the threat Faudo could bring to the world and infiltrates Faudo's body in order to stop its resurrection. As they progress inside Faudo, Kiyo is killed in battle but is resuscitated into a catatonic state by Zatch. Zatch and friends move on and meet the one controlling Faudo, Zeno who reveals he is Zatch's twin brother. Kiyo awakens and with Zatch battles and defeats Zeno and sends Faudo back to the Mamodo World.\n\nLater a powerful Mamodo named Clear Note reveals his intention to destroy the Mamodo world if crowned the Mamodo King. Kiyo and Zatch, with the help of friends, manage to defeat Clear Note leaving only Zatch and Brago battle as the remaining Mamodos. Zatch eventually engages and defeats Brago and is then crowned King of the Mamodo World. Zatch returns to the Mamodo world and restores the defeated Mamodos. Some time passes and Zatch sends Kiyo a letter telling him the peace of the Mamodo world.\n\nKiyo and Zatch are the protagonists in the two spun off animated films and . The pair appear in all of the Zatch Bell! series video games where the pair are played as a single character.\n\nIn the first \"Weekly Shōnen Sunday\" popularity polls of the series, Zatch ranked first and Kiyo ranked second. In the second and third Zatch Bell! character popularity contest, Zatch and Kiyo ranked first and third respectively. IGN's review of the first two Tankōbon of the series stated that Kiyo was not a likable character due to his abrasive attitude. IGN however described Zatch as \"...a funny, quirky character that's easy to like and easy to get annoyed with fairly quickly\". Mania.com's Jarred Pine review of the first volume also commented on Kiyo's irritating and arrogant persona. In the\nSPJA Industry Award, Jason Spisak was nominated fifth in the category \"best English voice actor\" for the voice of Kiyo. Debi Derryberry was nominated for \"Best Actress in a Comedy\" for her role as Zatch at the 2006 and 2007 American Anime Awards but did not win. Since the series was released, merchandise based on Zatch's appearance has been made such as plush toys and action figures.\n"}

Another legend says that if an unmarried stranger comes to the place, he unavoidably falls in love and marries and most of the time stays for good.\n\nCasiguran was founded by Spanish missionaries on 13 June 1609. Prior to their arrival, early settlers were the Dumagats and Aetas, followed by migrants from other parts of the Philippines. These migrants spoke different languages such as Ilocano, Visayan languages, Bikol languages, Kapampangan, Gaddang, Itawis and Ibanag, and from these a Kasiguranin dialect evolved.\n\nIn 1942, invading Japanese forces landed in the town of Casiguran. In 1945, Allied troops as well as Philippine Commonwealth forces and recognized guerrilla units during the Battle of Casiguran at the end of World War II. When the Philippines regained sovereignty in 1946, Aurora was still part of Tayabas Province (now Quezon Province) and Casiguran was a lone northern town. Its political jurisdiction is bounded on the north by the province of Isabela, on the west by Quirino, and on the south west by Barangay Dinadiawan, which was then the boundary between Baler and Casiguran.\n\nIn 1959 and 1966, the \"barrio\"s of Dilasag and Dinalungan, which were part of Casiguran and situated on its northern and south-western portions, were made into municipalities.\n\nOn August 2, 1968, the 7.6 magnitude 1968 Casiguran earthquake struck near Casiguran.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Aurora.\n\nCasiguran is located north-east of Baler, the provincial capital.

Between 1970 and 1975, there was a marked decreased in the number of population from 12,128 to 11,670. This reduction was due to deteriorated peace and order, which forced some of the population to move away. The trend reversed by 1980, with an increase of 19% or an annual average growth rate increase of 3.86%. Increasing population continued during the succeeding censal years (1980 to 1995) but with a declining annual average population growth rate. This is attributed to the gradual stoppage of logging operations in the area. Many workers involved in this trade were not original residents, so when the jobs were no longer available, they left. Between 1995 and 1999 there was a significant increase of the annual average population growth rate to 4.36%.\n\n\n"}

Brüning disclosed to his associates in the German Labour Federation that his chief aim as chancellor would be to liberate the German economy from the burden of continuing to pay war reparations and foreign debt. This would require an unpopular policy of tight credit and a rollback of all wage and salary increases (an internal devaluation). The Reichstag rejected Brüning's measures within a month, who then used emergency powers to pass it anyway. The Reichstag rejected the emergency decree with 256 votes from the Social Democrats, the Communists, the German National People's Party and the Nazis. Brüning asked Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag, who promptly did so on 18 July 1930. New elections were held on 14 September 1930.\n\nIn 1930, Germany was formally a multi-party parliamentary democracy, led by President Paul von Hindenburg (1925–1934). However, beginning in March 1930, Hindenburg only appointed governments without a parliamentary majority which systematically governed by emergency decrees, circumventing the democratically elected Reichstag. \n\nThe electoral law awarded one seat in the Reichstag per 60,000 votes. All citizens over 21 could vote through a system of proportional representation, a new parliament was elected every four years to deal with issues related to taxes, trade, defense, etc. The President was directly elected every seven years and was primarily in control of the armed forces, however, he also had significant powers to dissolve the Reichstag, nominate a Chancellor, veto laws, and utilize article 48.\n\nIn 1930, there were 37 individual parties running for office, only ten of which secured over 3% of the popular vote. The top five political parties participating in the 1930 election were the following:\nThe Nazis had increased their share of the vote in state elections since their 1928 federal election result. The SPD designated the \"bourgeois block\" and the Nazis as their enemies and, with the KPD, held rallies in Berlin on 1 August 1930 under the motto \"Never again war\". Some 30,000 participated in the SPD rally in the Lustgarten and 15,000 in the KPD demonstration at the Winterfeldtplatz. On 23 August, KPD members attacked a Nazi event in Bunzlau. Three people were killed and two seriously injured in fighting with the police. The KPD election campaign climaxed with a rally in the Berlin Sportpalast on 12 September.\n\nThe 1930 German election drew a record 82% voter turnout. The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) remained the strongest party and won 143 seats, a loss of 10 seats from the previous election. The National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP) rose to become the second-largest party with 18.25% of the vote and gained 107 seats, a massive increase from the 12 seats that had been gained in the last election. The only other party to increase its seats was the Communist Party of Germany, which won 13.13% of the vote, securing 77 seats, 23 more than in the last election. The 34 other political parties shared the remainder of the votes.\n"}

{"id": "2118630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118630", "title": "Great spotted kiwi", "text": "Great spotted kiwi\n\nThe great spotted kiwi, great grey kiwi or roroa (\"Apteryx haastii\") is a species of kiwi endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. The great spotted kiwi, as a member of the ratites, is flightless. It is the largest of the kiwi. The rugged topography and harsh climate of the high altitude, alpine, part of its habitat render it inhospitable to a number of introduced mammalian predators, which include dogs, ferrets, cats and stoats. Because of this, populations of this species have been less seriously affected by the predations of these invasive species compared to other kiwi. Nonetheless, there has been a 43% decline in population in the past 45 years, due to these predators and habitat destruction. This has led it to be classified as vulnerable. There are less than 16,000 great spotted kiwis in total, almost all in the more mountainous parts of northwest Nelson, the northwest coast, and the Southern Alps. A minority live on island reserves.\n\nThis kiwi is highly aggressive, and pairs will defend their large territories (49 acres) against other kiwi. Great spotted kiwi are nocturnal, and will sleep during the day in burrows. At night, they feed on invertebrates and will also eat plants. Great spotted kiwi breed between June and March. The egg is the largest of all birds in proportion to the size of the bird. Chicks take 75 to 85 days to hatch, and after hatching, they are abandoned by their parents.\n\nThis large kiwi is one of five species of kiwis residing in New Zealand. The other four are the tokoeka (\"Apteryx australis\"), Okarito brown kiwi (\"Apteryx rowi\"), little spotted kiwi (\"Apteryx owenii\"), and North Island brown kiwi (\"Apteryx mantelli\"). Great spotted kiwis are most closely related to the little spotted kiwi. The kiwi genus, \"Apteryx\", is endemic to New Zealand; 44% of the bird species native to New Zealand are endemic. Kiwis are placed in the ratite family, which also includes the emu, ostrich, rhea, and cassowary, as well as the extinct moa of New Zealand and elephant birds of Madagascar. All ratites are flightless. While it was long presumed that kiwi were closely related to moa, recent DNA research identified elephant birds as kiwi's closest relatives. Additionally, kiwi are more closely related to emus and cassowaries than to moa; the latter are actually closest to the weakly flying tinamous of South America.\n\nBefore the great spotted kiwi was known to science, several stories circulated about the existence of a large kiwi called the Maori roaroa. In 1871, two specimens were brought to the Canterbury Museum, where they were identified as a new species and were named after the museum's curator, Dr. Haast.\n\nThe great spotted kiwi was first described as \"Apteryx haastii\" by Thomas Potts, in 1872, based on a specimen from Westland, New Zealand. It is a monotypic species.\n\nThe genus name, \"Apteryx\", comes from the Ancient Greek words \"a\" \"without\" or \"no\", and \"pteryx\", \"wing\" and \"haasti\" is the Latin form of the last name of Sir Julius von Haast.\n\nGreat spotted kiwis are the largest of the kiwis; the male is tall, while the female is tall. Bill length ranges from , while weight ranges between for males and for females. The body is pear-shaped, while the head and neck is small with a long slender ivory bill. The great spotted kiwi, along with the other kiwi species, is the only bird with nostrils at the end of its bill. The eyes are small and do not see well, as it relies mostly on its sense of smell. The legs are short, with three toes per foot. It has a plumage composed of soft, hair-like feathers, which have no . The plumage can range from charcoal grey to light brown. They have large vibrissae around the gape, and they have no tail, only a small pygostyle. The common name of this bird comes from black spots on its feathers. They use their powerful legs and claws for defence against predators like stoats or ferrets. Kiwis are flightless birds, and hence lack hollow bones, lack a keel to which wing muscles anchor, and have tiny wings. This species also has a low body temperature compared to other birds. Average lifespan is 30 to 40 years.\n\nGreater spotted kiwis once lived in numerous areas throughout the South Island, but because of predation by invasive species, the remaining kiwi are now restricted to three localities. These kiwi live in higher altitude areas. Populations are present from northwestern Nelson to the Buller River, the northwest coast (Hurunui River to Arthur's Pass), and the Paparoa Range, as well as within the Lake Rotoiti Mainland Island. The Southern Alps population is particularly isolated. Great spotted kiwis reside in complex, maze-like burrows that they construct. Up to fifty burrows can exist in one bird's territory. They will often move around, staying in a different burrow every day. Bird's Nest Fungus sometimes grows in these burrows. Their habitat ranges in elevation from sea level to , but the majority are concentrated in a range from in a subalpine zone. These kiwis will live in tussock grasslands, scrubland, pasture, and forests.\n\nThe great spotted kiwi population started declining when European settlers first arrived in New Zealand. Before settlers arrived, about 12 million great spotted kiwis lived in New Zealand. This bird is often preyed upon by invasive pigs, dogs, ferrets and stoats, leading to a 5% chick survival rate. It has more of an advantage than other kiwi species over these predators because it lives in high altitude areas, where the wet upland population thrives. However, there has been a decrease in population of 43% in the past 45 years, and has declined 90% since 1900. Humans have also endangered the species by destroying their habitat by logging forests and building mines. Previously, humans hunted these kiwis for feathers and food. In 1988, the species was listed as Least Concern species. It is currently classified by the IUCN as a vulnerable species. This kiwi has an occurrence range of , and in 2000 an estimated 22,000 adult birds remained. They have been trending down about 5.8% a year. The main threat is from invasive predators including mustelids, brush-tailed possum \"Trichosurus vulpecula\", feral cats, dogs and pigs The most threatened populations are in the southern areas of the species' range. Less than 16,000 great spotted kiwis remain. Movements for saving the kiwi are in place, and sanctuaries for the great spotted kiwi have been made. Thanks to intensive trapping and poisoning efforts the chick survival rate has been raised to about 60% in areas where mammalian pest control is undertaken.\n\nThe great spotted kiwi is nocturnal in behaviour. If the kiwis live in an area lacking predators, they will come out in the day. At night, they come out to feed. Like other species of kiwi, they have a good sense of smell, which is unusual in birds. Males are fiercely territorial. At most, four to five kiwis live in a square kilometre. One pair's territory can be in size. It is not known how they defend such a large territory in proportion to their size. They will call, chase, or fight intruders out. Vocalisations of the great spotted kiwi include growls, hisses, and bill snapping. Great spotted kiwi males have a call that resembles a warbling whistle, while the female call is harsh raspy, and also warbling.\n\nIn the ground, they dig for earthworms and grubs, and they search for beetles, cicada, crickets, flies, weta, spiders, caterpillars, slugs and snails on the ground. They will also feed on berries and seeds. To find prey, the great spotted kiwi use their scenting skills or feel vibrations caused by the movement of their prey. To do the latter, a kiwi would stick its beak into the ground, then use its beak to dig into the ground. As they are nocturnal, they do not emerge until thirty minutes after sunset to begin the hunt. Kiwis will also swallow small stones, which aid in digestion.\n\nBecause adult great spotted kiwis are large and powerful, they are able to fend off most predators that attack them, such as stoats, ferrets, weasels, pigs, brush possums and cats, all of which are invasive species in New Zealand. However, dogs are able to kill even adults. Stoats, ferrets, possums, cats and dogs will feed on the eggs and chicks, meaning most chicks die within their first five months of life. Before the arrival of mammalian predators, the great spotted kiwi's natural predators would have been birds of prey like the extinct Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier and the extant Swamp harrier.\n\nGreat spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings sometimes lasting twenty years. Nests are made in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18 months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about two to three times during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of the egg. This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body. Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation is uncomfortable for the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water when they come out of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.\n\nAfter the female lays the egg, the male incubates the egg while the female guards the nest. Males only leave the nest for a few hours to hunt, and during this time, the female takes over. It takes 75 to 85 days for the egg to hatch. The kiwi chick takes 2 to 3 days simply to get out of its egg. Kiwi chicks are precocial, and are abandoned by their parents after hatching. After ten days, chicks venture out of the burrow to hunt. Most chicks are killed by predators in the first six months of their life. Great spotted kiwis reach full size at year six. Unlike most birds, female great spotted kiwis have two ovaries. Most birds have only one. Great spotted kiwis are distinguishable from other kiwi species by the fact that they can only produce one egg a year, as it takes so much energy to produce the massive egg.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118631", "title": "Little spotted kiwi", "text": "Little spotted kiwi\n\nThe little spotted kiwi, or little grey kiwi, \"Apteryx owenii\", is a small flightless bird in the kiwi family Apterygidae. It is the smallest species of all 5 kiwis, at about , about the size of a bantam. It is endemic to New Zealand, and in pre-European times occurred in both main islands, but is now restricted to a number of small offshore islands and mainland reserves protected by pest-exclusion fences.\n\nThe little spotted kiwi is a ratite and belongs to the Apterygiormes Order, and the Apterygidae Family. Their binomial name \"Apteryx owenii\" breaks down to \"without wings\" and \"owenii\" which is named after Sir Richard Owen. Today, only the nominate subspecies \"A. o. owenii\" exists. A subspecies, \"A. o. iredalei,\" from the North Island has been described. It became extinct in the late 19th century, but the subspecies isn't universally accepted as valid.\n\nThe little spotted kiwi was first described in 1847 by John Gould from a specimen obtained by F. Strang. The locality is not recorded but it probably came from Nelson or Marlborough. In 1873, Henry Potts published an account of its habits and about this time specimens were collected in South Westland and sent to England.\n\nThe little spotted kiwi has a length of and the weight of the male is and the female weighs , making it the smallest species of kiwi. Their feathers are pale-mottled grey, with fine white mottling, and are shaggy looking. They lack aftershafts and barbules. They have large vibrissae feathers around the gape. They lack a tail, but have a small pygostyle. Their bill is ivory and long and their legs are pale.\n\nStudies on Kapiti Island show that they prefer flax, seral, and older forest habitats. Lower numbers are found in rough grassland and scrub, indicating that either they prefer other habitats or they simply need a larger territory to support themselves in these areas.\n\nLittle spotted kiwis eat grubs and other small insects that are found underground, and occasionally eat berries. Using its sharp talons and long beak, it digs into the ground and then shoves its long beak down the softened ground. Since they can't fly to get to insects or food on trees and their eyesight is very poor, they depend on a keen sense of smell, long beak and talons.They are also nocturnal. Little spotted kiwi call occasionally each night to advertise territory and to maintain contact with partners. Often pairs will duet. They are very territorial, and fight conspecifics with their sharp claws, resulting in lots of feathers on the ground.\n\nThey nest in an excavated burrow, dug by both birds and sometimes line the nest with plant material. Eggs are laid from July to January. The clutch size is one to two eggs (15% have 2), and are incubated by the male for a period of 63–76 days. After hatching they stay in the nest for 2–3 weeks and require feeding for 4 weeks. The largest egg in comparison with the size of the bird is laid by the little spotted kiwi. Its egg accounts for 26 percent of its own weight—the equivalent of a human woman giving birth to a six-year-old child.\n\nAt the time it was described, the species was common on the western side of the South Island and in Marlborough. Then a regular trade in skins sprang up and large numbers were collected for European museums. Further, with the advance of European settlement, birds were killed by prospectors and others for food and their attendant dogs and cats took their toll. The species was extinct on the North Island by 1938 when the last four South Island birds were moved from d'Urville Island to the population that had been established on Kapiti Island. After they were released on Kapiti Island, they were also moved to Red Mercury Island, Hen Island, Tiritiri Matangi Island, Chalky Island, and Long Island in the Queen Charlotte Sound. In 2000, about 20 little spotted kiwis were released into Karori Wildlife Sanctuary. This was the first time since the 19th century that little spotted kiwis could be found on the mainland of the North Island.In 2015, 20 kiwis were translocated from Kapiti Island to Anchor Island.\n\nAs the smallest species of kiwi, the little spotted kiwi would be very vulnerable to the main kiwi predators like cats, dogs, and stoats, however it is now restricted to several off-shore island reserves (mainly Kapiti Island) which are mostly free of introduced predators. The little spotted kiwi's conservation status is listed as \"range restricted\" (by 'Save the Kiwi'), with a growing population. Formerly classified as \"vulnerable\" by the IUCN, it was suspected to be more numerous than generally assumed. Following the evaluation of its population size, this was found to be correct, and it was consequently downlisted to \"near threatened\" status in 2008 as, although not rare, its small range puts it at risk. The lack of predators, apart from weka (\"Gallirallus australis\"), is important to its increasing numbers. It has an occurrence range of , and a population of 1600 was estimated in the year 2012.\n\n\n"}

He returned to Sweden at the age of 19. He had inherited the entailed manor and important iron-works of Leufsta (Lövsta) in Uppland from his childless uncle and namesake and would substantially increased the wealth of the estate. \n\nEver since he had received a present of some silk worms at the age of eight, he had an interest in entomology and became a respected amateur entomologist at an early age. His major work was the \"Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire des insectes\" (eight volumes, 1752-1778). He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences already in 1739, at the age of nineteen, and a corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1748.\n\nHe is buried with his spouse in Uppsala Cathedral. His collections of insects were donated to the Academy of Sciences and now belong to the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm. He left a library at Leufsta which, among other things, included the papers of Olaus Rudbeck and an important collection of 18th century sheet music. The Leufsta library was acquired by Uppsala University Library in 1986 after a donation by Katarina Crafoord (one of the daughters of Holger Crafoord, the founder of Gambro).\n\nDe Geer was a great admirer of Réaumur. Hence his modelling \"Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire des insectes\" on Réaumur's work of the same title. It, too, is in French, similarly in large quarto and with the same decorations. The \"Mémoires\" deal with 1,466 species, treating life histories, food and reproduction based on careful, patient investigation and analysis of existing literature. There are 238 copper plates. The descriptions are acutely observed.\n\nIn nomenclature De Geer was less progressive; Volume 1 of the \"Mémoires\" (1752) was too early to employ the binomial system invented by his fellow Swede Linnaeus. Volume 2 (1771) did not use it, but in Volumes 3 (1773) to Volume 7 (1778) the Linnean system was employed. However, for many species De Geer used two or more words for a specific name, such as \"Aphis betulae nigro punctata\", these names were not binomial in the Linnean sense. He also proposed different names for many species which had previously been named and described by Linnaeus. It seems that using Linnean names was a concession to usage as in the 1760s and 1770s the Linnean system became increasingly employed, not because De Geer liked the new system. They had differences \"not everyone sees things in the same light, and people have the weakness of frequently being too fond of their own opinions\" (letter to Linnaeus 16 October 1772) and \"if here and there I am still of a different opinion, I am now, as before, asking you not to take it amiss\" (letter to Linnaeus 23 February 1774).\n\n\n\n\n"}

The species is part of the brown kiwi complex, and is morphologically very similar to other members of that complex. It is found in a restricted area of the Okarito forest on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island, and has a population of about only 600 birds. Some Okarito brown kiwi may live up to 100 years.\n\nThe Okarito kiwi is a monotypic species, i.e. there are no recognised subspecies. The genus name \"Apteryx\" stems from the Greek \"without wings\". Originally assumed to be the same species as the Southern brown kiwi \"A. australis\", DNA testing shows that the possible split off from this species was 8.2 million years ago, and the split from their closest relatives, the Northern Island brown kiwi \"A. mantelli\" was around 6.2 million years ago. This bird is a ratite and has similarities to the others (emu, ostrich, rhea, cassowary). Its sternum has no keel, its wings are minimal, and it has no preen gland. Its palate is also distinctive, and its feathers have no barbules or aftershaft. Other features that are similar to only the other kiwi is a weak gizzard and no tail, only a pygostyle.\n\nThe Okarito brown kiwi lives in the Okarito forest on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island. On 29 June 2010, three breeding pairs were released onto Blumine Island as part of a breeding program.\n\nThe female can lay up to three eggs, each in a different nest. Both the male and the female incubate the eggs. The egg is very large, as it weighs 20% of the female's weight (as in all kiwi). Most pairs are monogamous throughout their lives.\n\nThe Okarito kiwi is currently classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN due to habitat loss and predation by introduced stoats. Conservation efforts such as \"Operation Nest Egg\" and the stoat control regime have been partially successful in restoring the rowi population. However, the rowi is still in a fragile stage of existence. Predation, mainly from imported animals such as stoats, is still the biggest threat to the rowi. The South Okarito Forest was designated a kiwi sanctuary in 2000.\n\nThe West Coast Wildlife Centre in Franz Josef village operates a conservation programme as part of Operation Nest Egg. Eggs at risk of predation are removed, the chicks hatched in captivity, raised in a natural predator-free environment until old enough to fend for themselves, and then returned to the wild. Since opening, the operation has successfully raised and released 230 kiwi chicks. Surveys have ensured that there is no noticeable difference in behaviour between such birds and rowi growing up fully in the wild. The centre was developed in 2010 and offers behind the scenes tours of its kiwi hatching and rearing facilities and is the only place in New Zealand where one can see rowi in a nocturnal walkthrough area.\n\n"}

This bird holds the world record for laying the largest eggs relative to its body size.\n\nThe genome of \"Apteryx mantelli\" was sequenced in 2015.\n\nUntil 2000, the brown kiwi (then \"Apteryx australis\") was thought to include the rowi and the tokoeka, in addition to the North Island brown kiwi. However using genetic codes from each of the above it was determined that the tokoeka was a separate species, it took the \"Apteryx australis\" name, leaving the brown kiwi with its current \"Apteryx mantelli\" name. Soon after, in 1998, more genetic tests were done with the rowi and it was determined that it (the rowi) was a separate species (\"Apteryx rowi\"). In 2004 an injured bird was found with streaked white around the head and identified by Massey University. The white feathering is likely due to a rarely seen genetic variation sometimes described as a partial albino. Few documented cases exist with only a painting of one found in Otorohanga in the 18th century and a specimen in the Canterbury Museum. The injured bird recovered and was introduced into a breeding programme.\n\nThe brown kiwi was first described as \"Apteryx australis\" by Abraham Dee Bartlett, in 1813, based on a specimen from Dusky Sound, South Island, New Zealand. This is a monotypic species.\n\nBrown kiwi are found throughout the North Island, occurring near Northland, Coromandel, Eastern North Island, Aroha Island, Little Barrier Island, Kawau Island, Ponui Island, and the Whanganui Region. The North Island brown kiwi has demonstrated a remarkable resilience: it has adapted to live on scrub-like farm land, pine (an introduced tree) plantations, and their native forests, but it still prefers dense, sub-tropical and temperate forest.\n\nFemales stand about high and weigh about the males about . The plumage is streaky red-brown and spiky. The North Island brown kiwi is the only species of kiwi found internationally in zoos.\n\nThese kiwi, like all kiwi, feed on invertebrates. They have 2-3 clutches a year with 2 eggs in each clutch. Chicks are fully feathered at hatching and leave the nest and can fend for themselves within 1 week.\n\nThe North Island brown kiwi is Vulnerable, per the IUCN Red List, with the major threat coming from predators, such as dogs, cats, and stoat (\"Mustela erminea\"). 94% of chicks die before breeding in areas where mammalian pest control is not carried out. It has an occurrence range of , with a population, estimated in 2000, of 35,000.\n\nNationwide studies show that on average only 5 percent of kiwi chicks survive to adulthood. However, in areas under active pest management, survival rates for North Island brown kiwi can be far higher. For example, prior to a joint 1080 poison operation undertaken by DOC and the Animal Health Board in Tongariro Forest in 2006, 32 kiwi chicks were radio-tagged. 57% of the radio-tagged chicks survived to adulthood. Thanks to ongoing pest control, the adult kiwi population at Tongariro has almost doubled since 1998.\n\n"}

Light entering the prism is refracted into two rays, one of which emerges as plane-polarized light. Nicol prisms greatly facilitated the study of refraction and polarization, and were later used to investigate molecular structures and optical activity of organic compounds.\n\nIn 1815, Nicol developed a method of preparing extremely thin sections of crystals and rocks for microscopical study. He hit upon the plan of cutting sections of fossil wood, so as to reveal its minutest vegetable structures under a microscope. He took a slice from the specimen to be studied, ground it perfectly flat, polished it, and cemented it by means of Canada balsam to a piece of plate-glass. The exposed surface of the slice was then ground down, until the piece of stone was reduced to a thin pellicle adhering to the glass, and the requisite degree of transparency was obtained. His technique made it possible to view mineral samples by transmitted rather than reflected light and therefore enabled the minerals' internal structures to be seen. Nicol prepared a large number of slices of fossil and recent woods. Many of these were described by Henry Witham in his \"Observations of Fossil Vegetables\" (1831), to which Nicol supplied the first published account of the process.\n\nWhen Nicol died, his instruments and preparations passed to Alexander Bryson, who made many additions to the collections and made numerous thin slices of minerals and rocks for the purpose of exhibiting the cavities containing fluid, which had been described long before by David Brewster and Nicol.\n\nHe died at his home, 4 Inverleith Terrace in Edinburgh (now renumbered 12 Inverleith Terrace) on the 2 September 1851, and was buried in Warriston Cemetery. His burial site is now marked by a plaque on the east wall, north of the sealed eastern gate.\n\nDorsum Nicol on the Moon is named after him.\n"}

It dates from the 15th century (no later than 1485, the death of its author, and probably from the 1470s) but was not found until 1966 or 1968 by Prof. Godfrey Wettinger and Fr. M. Fsadni (OP). The poem is attributed to Pietru Caxaro, and was recorded by Caxaro's nephew, Brandano, in his notarial register (Dec. 1533–May 1563). It is preserved at the Notarial Archives in Valletta.\n\nAlthough written in Maltese, in Latin script, it was a very early Maltese that had not yet been influenced much by Romance languages, and is thus an example of historic Maltese. This text contains many Arabic morphemes. The only Romance words are \"vintura\" \"luck\", sometimes translated into English as fate, and \"et\" \"and\".

The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after winning 153 of the 491 seats. Voter turnout was 75.6%.\n\nThe only two parties to gain significantly were the SPD, which received almost a third of the vote, and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), which completed a thorough victory of the left wing. However, the SPD still failed to win a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government, led by Hermann Müller. Following his appointment as Chancellor, Müller, who had previously held the post for four months in 1920, created a grand coalition of members of the SPD, the German Democratic Party, the Centre Party and the German People's Party. However, the coalition was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their own interests than the interests of the government. As a result, Müller asked German President Paul von Hindenburg for emergency powers, but when Hindenburg refused, he resigned, marking the end of the \"last genuinely democratic government of the Weimar Republic\" on 27 March 1930.\n\nThe recently-reformed Nazi Party contested the elections after the ban on the party had been lifted in 1925. However, the party received less than 3% of the vote and won only 12 seats in the Reichstag. Adolf Hitler, who had been incarcerated in Landsberg prison for his involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch until Christmas 1924, had concentrated on re-establishing himself as the leader of the Nazi Party after his release rather than on his party's electability.\n\n"}

The four (4) other existing municipalities were just mission villages like the San Jose de Casecnan (now Maria Aurora), Dipaculao, Dilasag and Ditale. While what is now the municipality of San Luis was a \"barrio\" of Baler adjacent to the old barrios of Real, Bacong, Ditumabo and Zarah. It was named after the patron Saint \"San Luis Rey de Francia\".\n\nIn the Philippine Revolution of 1898, the five barrios became the hot beds of insurgency. The situation was aggravated when the insurrectos attacked the cazadores living in those areas.\n\nOn 9 December 1941, the locality suffered heavy casualties when the Japanese Imperial forces bombarded it. This caused the people to flee their homes and settle in nearby mountains of Dibalo and Dicaloyungan. From there, they organized and formed a guerilla group called \"205th Squadron\" which later became instrumental in liberating the province against the Japanese invading forces by the local Filipino soldiers and the recognized guerrillas in 1945.\n\nIn 1945, local Filipino troops of the 3rd, 5th, 52nd, 53rd, 54th, 55th, 56th and 57th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 5th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was liberated in San Luis, Tayabas (now, Aurora) and helping recognized guerrilla groups of the 205th Squadron Guerrillas to defeat and fight against the Japanese Imperial forces and ended in World War II during the Northern Tayabas Campaign.\n\nThe Sub-Province of Aurora was created through the enactment of Republic Act No. 648 on 14 of July 1951. This law provides for the creation of other municipalities in the province. Local officials sought the assistance of Congressman Manuel S. Enverga of Quezon to create a separate municipality comprising the adjacent barrios. Congressman Enverga sponsored House Bill No. 2863, which later became Republic Act No. 2452, creating the Municipal District of San Luis.\n\nFrom 21 June 1959, San Luis was operating as a Municipal District by virtue of Republic Act No. 2452.

These rocks are composed of basalt, andesite, greywackes and breccia.\n\nMetamorphic rocks are altered rocks from sedimentary and igneous origin and are formed due to intense pressure and temperature. Their composition includes amphibolites, quartz feldspar, Phyllites and slate. Metamorphic rocks are largely found at the western and eastern portion of the municipality (mountainous areas facing the Pacific Ocean).\n\nFour (4) hypsographic units were identified in the municipality of San Luis: lowland soils, upland soils, soils of the hills, and mountain soils.

Other sources of potable water are pumps, springs, free flows, and wells.\n\nSome barangays such as Barangay Poblacion, Diteki and Ditumabo are already enjoying piped- in water supply whose water source is from spring developments with mainline pipes connected where smaller pipes are attached and distributed to different households.\n\nThe telecommunication services in the municipality mostly are cellular phones with Smart and Globe as service provider. Single side band radios are also available but mostly it's privately owned or used by military personnel. There is also internet service now in the municipality with Smart Broadband as provider.\n\nPostal service facility is located in the Municipal Hall. The delivery efficiency of the Municipal post office is however limited considering only one (1) personnel manned it. Postal delivery services cover only barangays surrounding the Poblacion.\n\nThe electric power supply of the 17 of 18 barangay in municipality comes from the Aurora Electric Company's (AURELCO) 69 KV sub-station through the Bongabon area. It has a total capacity of 5 Mega volts Ampere (MVA) stationed in Barangay San Isidro. 94% of the household on the said 17 barangays are already energized.\n\nBarangay Dimanayat has a 5 KW Micro-Hydro Project which provides its electricity. This project is by the Municipality of San Luis is with counterpart from the Central Luzon State University Affiliated Non-Conventional Energy Center (CLSU-ANEC) and Barangay Dimanayat.\n\nSan Luis Mini-Hydro Power Plant is operationalized since June 2013 and one of the other income generating project of the municipality with minimum capacity of 400 kilowatts. Currently, its income supports to the power consumption of its constituents thru power subsidies.\n\nThere are four flood control and drainage structure in the municipality. These are located in barangay Diteki, Ditumabo, Nonong Sr. San Isidro and Brgy Dibalo. The major rivers of the municipality are commonly experiencing riverbanks erosion, which are attributed to loose young soil materials (alluvial), and large volume of floodwaters with high velocity. Some sections of these rivers require additional flood control structures.\n\n"}

He attracted the attention of Gustavus III by his eloquent preaching at the fashionable St Clara church at Stockholm. Gustavus at once took the young priest by the hand, appointed him, at twenty-five, one of his chaplains; made him a canon before he was thirty and a bishop at thirty-two, and finally placed him at the head of the newly appointed commission for reforming the ecclesiastical administration of the country.\n\nThus at thirty-four Wallqvist had nothing more to hope for but the primacy, which would infallibly have been his also had the archbishop died during the king's lifetime. Wallqvist was, however, much more of a politician than a churchman. His knowledge of human nature, inexhaustible energy, dauntless self-confidence and diplomatic finesse made him indispensable to Gustavus III. His seductive manners too often won over those whom his commanding eloquence failed to convince.\n\nHis political career began during the mutinous \"riksdag\" of 1786, when he came boldly forward as one of the royalist leaders. But it was at the stormy riksdag of 1789 that Wallqvist put forth all his powers. The retirement of the timid primate left him without an equal in the Estate of Clergy, and it was very largely due to his co-operation that the king was able to carry through the famous \"Act of Unity and Security\" which converted Sweden from a constitutional into a semi-absolute monarchy.\n\nNevertheless, even the combative Wallqvist was appalled when, on February 16, 1789, the king privately informed him that he meant on the following day soundly to trounce the Estate of Nobles in the presence of the three other estates and bend them to his royal will. A friend of compromise, like most of the men of his cloth, Wallqvist dissuaded all revolutionary expedients at the outset, though when the king proved immovable the bishop materially smoothed the way before him. At this memorable riksdag Wallqvist exhibited, moreover, financial ability of the highest order, and, as president of the ecclesiastical commission, assisted in balancing the budget and find the funds necessary for resuming the war with Russia.\n\nDuring the brief riksdag of 1792, as a member of the secret committee, Wallqvist was at the very centre of affairs and rendered the king essential services. Indeed it may be safely said that Gustavus III, during the last six years of his reign, mainly depended upon Wallqvist and his clerical colleague, Carl Gustaf Nordin, who were patriotic enough to subordinate even their private enmity to the royal service.\n\nDuring the Reuterholm administration, Wallqvist, like the rest of the Gustavians, was kept remote from court. In 1800 he was recalled to the political arena. But his old rivalry with Nordin was resumed at the same time, and when the latter defeated a motion of the bishop's in the Estate of Clergy, at the diet of Norrköping, Wallqvist from sheer vexation had a stroke of apoplexy and died the same day.\n\nAs bishop of Växjö, Wallqvist was remarkable for his extraordinary administrative ability. He did much for education and for the poorer clergy, and endowed the library of the gymnasium with 6000 volumes. As an author also he was more than distinguished. His \"Ecclesiastique Samlingar\" testify to his skill and diligence as a collector of manuscripts, while his \"Minnen och Bref\", ed. E. V. Montan (Stockholm, 1878), is one of the most trustworthy and circumstantial documents relating to the Gustavian era of Swedish history.\n\n"}

It had roots in Shia Islam but established its own laws and teachings that made a clear break from Islam. From its start there have been controversies and challenges over its teachings and accusations against its leaders. Criticism has primarily come from Islamic and Christian leaders who see its teachings as heretical, and particularly the government of Iran, who claims its Baháʼí population to be a political threat.\n\nCriticism falls into a few categories: fault with its teachings, the character of its founders, and ongoing conflicts with its administration. \n\nChristians have been known to dismiss the Baháʼí Faith as a syncretic combination of faiths or point to discrepancies between faiths to contradict the idea of unity of religion. The Christian doctrine of atonement is commonly understood to exclude all other religions as a path to God. Regarding the Baháʼí teachings of peace and unity, E.G. Browne argued that while they are admirable, they are, in his opinion, inferior to the simplicity and beauty of the teachings of Christ. He further argued that in the case of \"Baha'ism, with its rather vague doctrines as to the nature and destiny of the soul of man, it is a little difficult to see whence the driving force to enforce the ethical maxims can be derived.\"\n\nChristian apologist Francis J. Beckwith wrote of the Baháʼí teachings:\nBaháʼí authors have written in response that the contradictory teachings are either social laws that change from age to age, as part of a progressive revelation, or human error introduced to the more ancient faiths over time.\n\nMuslim theology regards Muhammad as the \"Khatam an-Nabiyyin\", the last prophet whom God has sent and Islam as the final religion for all humankind. In this view, it is impossible for either any prophet after Muhammad or any new religion to come into existence, and thus they reject the Baháʼí Faith. Some Muslims claim that the idea of oneness of humanity is not a new principle; they claim that Islam espouses such a principle. Some Shiʿites have been known to picture the faith as a \"heresy\" or \"a political movement\". Many Islamic scholars reject all prophets after Muhammad, and regard Baháʼís as apostates if they had been Muslims before conversion. Critics also argue that, despite the Baháʼí Faith's claim of unity, there are numerous theological differences between Islam and the Baháʼí Faith, with one critic, Imran Shaykh, arguing that the disparities are evidence to the Baháʼí Faith not being a natural progression of Islam, as is claimed.\n\nWhile Baháʼí teachings assert that men and women are spiritually equal, author Lil Abdo says that the Baháʼí understanding of sexual equality is different from that of secular feminists. Abdo presented the following list of criticisms of the Baháʼí Faith from a feminist perspective at an annual gathering for Baháʼí studies in 1995:\n\nThere is some tension over the Baháʼí principle that religion and science should be in harmony. There are statements from the religion's founders of a scientific nature that could be interpreted as contrary to standard science. Prominent among them are references by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá that humans evolved over a long period, but were never animals. Many Baháʼí authors have commented that the intention of the comments were in line with a modern understanding of evolution and that the apparent conflict is an unfortunate semantic mistake. The Baháʼí commentator Salman Oskooi acknowledged that the comments by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá are not in line with current scientific understanding, but that ʻAbdu'l-Bahá should not be regarded as infallible in scientific matters.\n\nOther scientifically controversial ideas from Baháʼu'lláh include that the universe is without beginning or end, that every planet has \"creatures\", and that copper can turn into gold.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh claimed to be a Manifestation of God, which is the Baháʼí term for people like Jesus and Muhammad. William Miller says that the wording of Baháʼu'lláh's Kitáb-i-Aqdas made it difficult to distinguish between the words of the author and the words of God. He further opines that \"Baháʼu'lláh felt no such distinction was necessary\", as he manifested God as a reflection of a perfect mirror, and that \"Baháʼu'lláh claims to be not merely a human Messenger of God, but a Divine Manifestation\". This claim of divinity has been criticised by Imran Shaykh who points to this as an example of a discrepancy between faiths.\n\nAlthough polygamy is forbidden by Baháʼí law, Baháʼu'lláh himself had three concurrent wives. Under Islamic law a man may have up to four wives, and Baháʼu'lláh wrote in 1873 that a Baháʼí may have two wives. His son ʻAbdu'l-Bahá had one wife and said that having a second wife is conditional upon treating both wives with justice and equality, and was not possible in practice. Baháʼís view the issue as a gradual transition towards monogamy. \n\nBaháʼís view the Báb (1819-1844) as a predecessor to Baháʼu'lláh, whose claim to revelation established the Baháʼí Faith separate from the Bábí Faith. Before the Báb's death he appointed a caretaker leader named Subh-i-Azal (born Mírzá Yahyá) who was also the half-brother of Baháʼu'lláh. Tensions between Subh-i-Azal and Baháʼu'lláh grew in Baghdad and escalated in Istanbul and Edirne. While in Edirne Subh-i-Azal attempted to murder Baháʼu'lláh with poison, which caused a hard split in 1866 between those Bábís loyal to either Baháʼu'lláh or Subh-i-Azal. When the Ottoman government wished to eliminate the Bábís, they further exiled Baha'u'llah and his followers to Akka, and Subh-i-Azal and his followers to Cyprus, but left several of each in the other's city in an attempt to further stoke conflict. In Akka, a few followers of Baha'u'llah murdered the Azalí Bábís in the city.\n\nThe Baháʼí scriptures intend for a line of Guardians to fill an executive role alongside the Universal House of Justice, each Guardian appointed by the preceding one from among the male descendants of Baháʼu'lláh. The first Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, had nobody eligible to appoint and died in 1957 without making an appointment. Six years later the first Universal House of Justice was elected and has functioned without a Guardian. In 1960 Mason Remey announced that he should be regarded as the next Guardian, creating a short-lived schism.\n\nThe Baháʼí Faith has had several challenges to leadership, notably at the transitions after the passing of Baháʼu'lláh, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi. Claimants challenging the widely accepted successions of leadership are shunned as covenant-breakers.\n\nBaháʼís have been accused, particularly by successive Iranian governments, of being agents or spies of Russia, Britain, the Shah, the United States, and as agents of Zionism—each claim being linked to each regime's relevant enemy and justifying anti-Baháʼí actions. The last claim is partially rooted in the presence of the Baháʼí World Centre in northern Israel.\n\nJuan Cole converted to the Baháʼí Faith in 1972, but later resigned in 1996 after conflicts with members of the administration who perceived him as extreme. Cole went on to critically attack the Baháʼí Faith in several books and articles written from 1998-2000, describing a prominent Baháʼí as \"inquisitor\" and \"bigot\", and describing Baháʼí institutions as socially isolating, dictatorial, and controlling, with financial irregularities and sexual deviance. Cole accused the Baháʼí Administration of exaggerating the numbers of believers. Central to Cole's complaints was a process of review that required Baháʼí authors to gain approval before publishing on the religion.\n\nSoon after his resignation, Cole created an email list and website called H-Bahai, which became a repository of both primary source material and critical analysis on the religion.\n"}
{"id": "2118674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118674", "title": "Imputed righteousness", "text": "Imputed righteousness\n\nImputed righteousness is a concept in Christian theology proposing that the \"righteousness of Christ ... is imputed to [believers] — that is, treated as if it were theirs through faith.\"\n\nThe teaching of imputed righteousness is a signature doctrine of the Lutheran and Reformed\ntraditions of Christianity. There is some dispute as to the origin of the reformation era concept of imputed righteousness. Some modern Lutherans deny that Luther taught it before other reformers such as Melancthon. However, Luther did use the term in this sense as early as 1516. In his seminal 1516 Novum Instrumentum omne (actually finished late in 1515 but printed in March 1516), Erasmus rendered the Greek \"logizomai\" (reckon) as \"imputat\" all eleven times it appears in Romans chapter four. The Vulgate Erasmus intended to \"correct\" usually rendered it \"reputat\" (repute). Erasmus was at this time famous and Luther almost unknown, leaving open the possibility that the concept itself did not originate from Luther, but rather, if not from Erasmus, then within the wider church reform movement.\n\nDiscussion of these concepts are complicated by different definitions of key terms, such as \"justification\" and \"grace\".\n\nImputed righteousness is the righteousness of Jesus credited to the Christians, enabling the Christians to be justified. Double imputation refers to the imputation of believers' sin to Christ and the imputation of Christ's righteousness to believers. It is closely related to the Reformed doctrine of justification by grace through faith alone. Passages like 2 Corinthians 5:21, are employed to argue for a dual imputation – the imputation of one's sin to Christ and then of his righteousness to us.\n\nInfused righteousness, by contrast, can be described as: \"In Augustine's view, God bestows justifying righteousness upon the sinner in such a way that it becomes part of his or her person.\"\n\nImparted righteousness, in Methodist theology, is what God does in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit after justification, working in the Christian to enable and empower the process of sanctification (and, in Wesleyan thought, Christian perfection). John Wesley believed that imparted righteousness worked in tandem with imputed righteousness.\n\nStarting with Augustine, the Roman Catholic tradition has understood justification as the entire process by which God forgives and then transforms Christians. Based on their reading of the use of \"justification\" in Paul's letters, the Reformers took justification to refer specifically to God's forgiveness and acceptance. The term \"sanctification\" was used to refer to the lifelong process of transformation. Thus the Roman Catholic term \"justification\" effectively includes both what Protestants refer to as \"justification\" and \"sanctification.\" This difference in definitions can result in confusion, effectively exaggerating the disagreement. However the difference in definitions reflects a difference in substance. In the Protestant concept, justification is a status before God that is entirely the result of God's activity and that continues even when humans sin. Thus using different words for justification and sanctification reflects a distinction between aspects of salvation that are entirely the result of God's activity, and those that involve human cooperation. The Roman Catholic tradition uses a single term, in part, because it does not recognize a distinction of this type. For the Roman Catholic tradition, while everything originates with God, the entire process of justification requires human cooperation, and serious sin compromises it.\n\nBoth imputed and infused righteousness agree that God is the source of our righteousness, and that it is a gift that humans cannot deserve. Both models agree that God's activity results in humans being transformed, so that over time they become more obedient to God, and sin is progressively\ndefeated in their lives. \n\nThe distinction includes at least two areas:\n\n\n\nWhile there are significant differences between imputed and infused righteousness, they can be regarded to a certain extent as differences in emphasis that are potentially complementary. Imputed righteousness emphasizes that salvation is a gift from God and is dependent upon him, while infused righteousness emphasizes the responsibility of humans to cooperate with God's actions in transforming their lives. The position that they are potentially complementary is taken by a joint declaration of the Lutheran World Federation and the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nEnough differences remain, however, both in doctrine and in practical consequences, that not everyone agrees that the two views can be regarded as complementary.\n\nThe concepts here are nominally derived from the letters of Paul the Apostle (particularly the Epistle to the Romans), which form a large part of the Christian New Testament.\n\nHowever the concepts have been filtered through the concerns of later Christian theology. From at least the time of Augustine of Hippo in the 5th Century, \"righteousness\" has been seen as a moral and religious quality. In the Roman Catholic model, Christians are transformed by God's action, developing a righteousness of their own. In the 16th Century, the Protestant Reformers came to understand human acceptance by God according to a \"forensic\" model, in which God declares humanity not guilty, even though they were in a moral sense still guilty of sin. However, the Reformers continued to accept the traditional concept of righteousness. What changed is that the righteousness was seen as Christ's, which was credited (\"imputed\") to Christians by God.\n\nStarting in the middle of the 20th Century, increased knowledge of first Century Judaism has produced a reassessment of many of the concepts with which Paul was working. Many scholars now see \"righteousness\" as a Hebrew concept referring to fidelity to God's covenant with humanity (for God) or the status of being a proper member of that covenant (for a human). If this is correct, then righteousness is a status, not a quality of religious/moral perfection.\n\nThis section is a precis of N. T. Wright's work in \"What Saint Paul Really Said\".\n\nWright, one of the best-known advocates of the New Perspective on Paul, teaches that \"righteousness of God\" and \"righteousness from God\" are distinct concepts that have been confused and conflated in the past. He relates the court-room metaphor, pointing out that there are three parties in the Hebrew court - two parties in disagreement and one judge (there is no \"Prosecuting Attorney\"). The judge decides the dispute between the parties declaring one to be correct and the other incorrect. The one who is declared \"correct\" in court is called \"righteous\" in the matter that was judged.\n\nThe \"righteousness of God\", referring to God's (the judge's) faithfulness to the covenant relationship, \"can be neither imputed nor imparted to anybody\" but refers only to his role as judge. \"Righteousness from God\" is roughly equivalent to \"vindication\", meaning that God is pronouncing that particular party to be correct/vindicated/righteous/acquitted in their dispute with the other party. The dispute in question in Christian theology is between those of faith (in God's promises: the covenant, the Messiah), and \"the wicked,\" meaning everyone else. Paul posited that the people of such faith are vindicated when Messiah returns, being declared \"righteous\" (or in other words, vindicated for their stance), which is exactly the meaning of the Biblical term \"justified\", in Wright's view.\n\nThis means that we do not \"receive\" the righteousness of God (or as often expressed, \"of Jesus\"), as in the classical Evangelical vernacular, nor is it \"infused\" as in the classical Roman Catholic vernacular. The \"righteousness of God\" remains His alone, and our \"righteousness from God\" means that we are found to be \"of\" the people of God. Paul's argument is that it has always been so, but what has changed is that the Messiah, in Jesus of Nazareth, has now appeared.\n\nAn important verse to note is 2 Cor 5:21, \"For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God\" (ESV), which has traditionally been interpreted to mean that the Christian has, in some way, become righteous (by impartation or imputation), in exchange for Jesus' sinlessness. Moreover, Wright says, Paul is speaking here \"of the apostles,\" and pointing out that \"in their role as apostles,\" their activity is effectively God's righteousness (covenant faithfulness) in action (\"we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God\" - v 20). This meaning is natural when taken in context from verse 11 through 21.\n\nImputed righteousness is the Protestant Christian doctrine that a sinner is declared righteous by God purely by God's grace through faith in Christ, and thus all depends on Christ's merit and worthiness, rather than on one's own merit and worthiness. On the one hand, God is infinitely merciful, \"not wishing for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance.\" (2 Peter 3:9) ----- though this passage is often interpreted by many Protestants as referring only to Christians, as the context of the epistle indicates that Peter's audience were believers, and the first half of the verse indicates that the promises of God to believers are not late but patiently enduring the unfolding of history as God sovereignly saves His own through time. On the other, God is infinitely holy and just, which means that he cannot approve of or even look upon evil (Habakkuk 1:13), neither can he justify a wicked person (Book of Proverbs 17:15). Because the Bible describes all men as sinners and says that there are none who are righteous (Epistle to the Romans 3:23, 10) this is a classic theological tension. To use the words of St Paul, how can God be \"just and the justifier of those who believe (Rom. 3:26)?\" Through this argument, God cannot ignore or in any way overlook sin.\n\nAdherents say that God the Father resolves this problem by sending Christ, who is sinless and indestructibly perfect in character, to lead a perfect life and sacrifice himself for the sins of mankind. The sins of the repentant sinner are cast onto Christ, who is a perfect sacrifice. First of all, they note that the New Testament describes the method of man's salvation as the \"righteousness of God\" (Rom. 3:21, 22; 10:3; Philippians 3:9). They then note that this imputed righteousness is particularly that of Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Corinthians 1:30). When they refer to the \"imputed righteousness of Christ,\" they are referring to his intrinsic character as well as his life of sinlessness and perfect obedience to God's law on Earth, usually called his active obedience. The need for a human life of perfect obedience to God's law was the reason that Christ, who is God, had to become incarnate (take on human flesh) and live as a human being. Paul's statement in Romans 4:6, that God \"imputes righteousness apart from works,\" is the basis for the fourth step in the argument that this righteousness of Christ is imputed to the believer's account. By this terminology, they mean that God legally credits the believer with the righteous acts that Christ performed while on this earth. Luther uses the language of a \"fortunate exchange\" to describe this concept, borrowed from St Paul's imagery in Colossians 3. Christ trades his \"garments,\" holiness, righteousness, being blessed by God the Father, in exchange for human sin. This is really good news for sinners - Christ takes their sin and believers receive His blessed condition and righteousness.\n\nThis righteousness of Christ and its relationship to the recipient can also be likened to adoption. Adoption legally constitutes a child the son or daughter of a person that is not that child's birth parent. Similarly, in marriage the married partners are considered one entity legally. When a sinner believes in Christ, he or she is spiritually united with Christ, and that union makes it possible for God to credit believers with the righteousness of Christ without engaging in \"legal fiction.\"\n\nMany Christians, most notably of the Catholic tradition, believe that when God declares someone righteous in Christ he actually makes that person righteous. This, therefore, means that someone is now infused with the righteousness of Christ. Christ's righteousness is a present reality, but it is in the form of that person's own righteousness.\n\nCatholics contend that the final interpretation of scripture falls to the historical Catholic Church (collectively known as the Magisterium); in particular the opinions of the early Church Fathers - many of whom held opinions on justification before the closure of the Christian Canon. Therefore, the more recent Protestant understandings of the Greek word δικαιοο is not only seen to be in error lexically, but also historically.\n\nA major objection to imputed righteousness is that it appears to be a means of acquitting the guilty rather than pardoning the guilty. (Scripture denies the possibility of acquitting the guilty in Exodus 23:7 and Deuteronomy 25:1.) The Greek word δικαιοο, usually translated \"justify,\" may be understood in another sense: \"to do justice\" \"to have justice done\" (Thayer's Lexicon) or \"to satisfy justice.\" The 1968 Supplement of Liddell Scott and Jones also includes the definition, \"brought to justice\"; This sense is the normative definition found in Hellenistic Greek meaning \"to punish\" or \"administer justice (to someone).\" Instead of meaning declared righteous or made righteous, the term may mean the proper or legally approved punishment has been administered. Understood this way, the objectionable idea of acquitting the guilty in the term \"justify\" is avoided.\n\nThe Protestant doctrine of imputed righteousness is also opposed by the doctrine of The New Church, as explained by Emanuel Swedenborg, and is thus closely aligned with the Roman Catholic tradition. The \"imputation\" of the Lord's merit is nothing but the remission of sins after repentance. According to Swedenborg, \"Mention is often made in the Word of \"the righteous,\" of \"righteousness,\" and of \"to be made righteous;\" but what is specifically signified by these expressions is not yet known. ...It is believed by the heads of the church that he is righteous, and has been made righteous, who is acquainted with the truths of faith from the doctrine of the church and from the Word, and consequently is in the trust and confidence that he is saved through the Lord's righteousness, and that the Lord has acquired righteousness by fulfilling all things of the Law, and that He acquired merit because He endured the cross, and thereby made atonement for and redeemed man. Through this faith alone a man is believed to be made righteous; and it is believed further that such are they who are called in the Word \"the righteous.\" Yet it is not these who are called \"righteous\" in the Word; but those who from the Lord are in the good of charity toward the neighbor; for the Lord alone is righteous, because He alone is righteousness. Therefore, a man is righteous, and has been made righteous, insofar as he receives good from the Lord, that is, insofar, and according to the way, in which he has in him what belongs to the Lord. The Lord was made righteousness through His having by His own power made His Human Divine. This Divine, with the man who receives it, is the Lord's righteousness with him, and is the very good of charity toward the neighbor; for the Lord is in the good of love, and through it in the truth of faith, because the Lord is Divine love itself.\"\n\n\"The Catholic idea maintains that the formal cause of justification does not consist in an exterior imputation of the justice of Christ, but in a real, interior sanctification effected by grace, which abounds in the soul and makes it permanently holy before God. Although the sinner is justified by the justice of Christ, inasmuch as the Redeemer has merited for him or her the grace of justification (\"causa meritoria\"), nevertheless he or she is formally justified and made holy by his or her own personal justice and holiness (\"causa formalis\").\" Although internal and proper to the one justified, this justice and holiness are still understood as a gift of grace through the Holy Spirit rather than something earned or acquired independently of God's salvific work. Put starkly, the Roman Catholic Church rejects the teaching of imputed righteousness as being a present reality. This is at the very center of the disagreements between Roman Catholics and Lutherans, and remains the primary sticking point to a unification of these traditions to this day.\n\nPhilipp Melanchthon, a contemporary of Martin Luther, stressed the classic Lutheran desire to distinguish carefully and properly between Law and Gospel. In doing so he emphasized that Law binds, convicts, and drives people, while the Gospel proclaims repentance, the promise of grace, eternal life, and proclaims their liberty in Christ.\n\nThe Reformed and Presbyterian churches have generally followed the Lutherans on the importance of distinguishing the law and the gospel. Articulated in terms of Covenant Theology, law and gospel have been associated with the Covenant of Law (Mosaic, not to be confused with Covenant of Works, Adamic) and the Covenant of Grace, respectively. Historically, they have been more open to the broader biblical language the Lutheran Formula of Concord calls \"correct\" but not \"proper.\" Recently, some prominent theologians have disputed the centrality of the law-gospel distinction in the Reformed tradition.\n\nThose who hold to the doctrine of imputed righteousness reject the Roman Catholic teaching of \"gratia infusa\" (infused grace) because Lutheran and Calvinist anthropologies (see total inability) allow no room for the Roman Catholic concept of \"synteresis\" (a \"spark of goodness\"). For Protestants, the nature of man is profoundly damaged as a result of the Fall, leaving him in bondage to sin and rendering him incapable of choosing God as Lord and treasure over sin. In regard to salvation, there is nothing in a sinner that is worth being redeemed by God (the sinner does not possess any intrinsic merit or worth). Hence the necessity for imputed righteousness, since there is nothing internal onto which God's grace can be fused. Something altogether more radical must be done to make a sinner righteous: his utterly sinful nature must be replaced by a new nature made by God (New Birth). This new nature is immediately both righteous and holy 'positionally' in God's eyes and, it also makes the sinner newly capable of achieving 'practical' and 'experiential' righteousness and holiness through the process of Sanctification.\n\n\n\nOpposing views:\n"}

The author of the \"Memoriale\" lived in the reign of Edward I, and mentions the homage done to Edward as overlord of Scotland (1291).\n\nSince the main narrative extends only to 1225, the \"Memoriale\" is emphatically a second-hand production. But for the years 1201-1225 it is a faithful transcript of a contemporary chronicle, the work of a Barnwell canon. A complete text of the Barnwell chronicle is preserved in the College of Arms' (Heralds' College, manuscript 10) but has never yet been printed, though it was collated by Bishop Stubbs for his edition of the Memoriale. The Barnwell annalist, living in Cambridgeshire, was well situated to observe the events of the barons' war, and is our most valuable authority for that important crisis.\n\nHe is less hostile to King John than are Ralph of Coggeshall, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. He praises the king's management of the Welsh and Scottish wars; he is critical in his attitude towards the pope and the English opposition; he regards the submission of John to Rome as a skilful stroke of policy, although he notes the fact that some men called it a humiliation. The constitutional agitation of 1215 does not arouse his enthusiasm; he passes curtly over the Runnymede conference, barely mentions Magna Carta, and blames the barons for the resumption of war. It may be from timidity that the annalist avoids attacking John, but it is more probable that the middle classes, whom he represents, regarded the designs of the feudal baronage with suspicion.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nSituated in the western coast of Marinduque Island, the municipality is bordered in the north by the municipality of Mogpog, in the west by the Tayabas Bay and Sibuyan Sea, in the east by the municipality of Torrijos, and in the south by the municipalities of Gasan and Buenavista.\n\nBoac, a heritage town in its own right, is known as one of the main venues of the annual Moriones Festival and is the location of a number of historical sites in Marinduque including the Boac Cathedral fortress church, Casa Real and the Liwasan ng Kalayaan, Laylay Port, and the Battle of Paye site. The municipality is also home to the Marinduque Branch of the National Museum of the Philippines.\n\nThe toponym \"Boac\" is derived from the Cebuano word \"bu-ak\", cognatic to the Tagalog word \"bi-ak\" and the southern Tagalog term \"ba-ak\". This is in reference to the town being bisected by the Boac River which runs from the Central Marinduque and Balagbag Mountain Ranges to the west coast facing the Tayabas Bay and Sibuyan Sea. Other references suggest that the name \"Boac\" is derived from the Tagalog term \"bulwak\" referring to the gush of water at the estuaries and mouth of the Boac River.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonization, the first \"visita\" called \"Montserrat de Marinduque\" was established in the island in 1580 in what is now Boac.\n\nIn the early years of Spanish colonization in Marinduque, it was first mentioned in Miguel de Loarca’s \"Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas\" (1582-1583) that the natives of the island are \"Pintados\" or tattooed people resembling those from the Camarines Provinces and the Visayan Islands. In 1580, the first \"visita\" was established in the island of Marinduque and was called \"Montserrat de Marinduque\" in what is now the municipality of Boac; this \"visita\" was governed by Fray Alonzo Banol as minister.\n\nIn 1621, the Spanish Jesuit missionaries brought a three-foot Marian image to Boac which will later be known as the \"Mahal na Ina ng Biglang Awa\". Notorious for their sea raids, a group of Muslim pirates from the southern Philippines sieged Boac in the mid-17th century along the shores of Laylay and eventually into the Poblacion located along the Boac River. In panic, the locals took refuge in the fortress church of Boac as able-bodied men defended the outer walls against the attacks. Many locals were killed and, by the third day of siege, the surviving locals began to run short on food and the capture of the fortress became imminent. As an act of faith, the survivors prayed fervently at the throne of Mary, asking her to deliver them from these enemies. According to legends, a very strong storm with torrential rain, thunder, and lightning engulfed the area and at its very height, it was reported that the image of a beautiful lady with outstretched arms appeared standing on the top of the fortress wall. Terrorized, the pirates fled in confusion to their vintas and left the island. Since then, the image of Mary has been honoured and given the title \"Biglang Awa.\" To commemorate this miracle, the old image brought by the Jesuits in Boac was placed in a shrine erected on the portion of the wall where Mary is said to have appeared.\n\nIn 1942, Boac was occupied by Japanese troops. In 1945, the Battle of Marinduque began and the American-Philippine Commonwealth troops landed in Boac after the war was built of the general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary from 1945 to 1946 station in this municipality.\n\nThe Provincial Government of Marinduque under Gov. Carmencita O. Reyes built a larger-than-life-size image of the Our Lady of Biglang Awa in cement and placed in the seashore in Balanacan Port to welcome travelers to the island.\n\nOn May 10, 2008, the Diocese of Boac celebrated the 13th anniversary and the golden anniversary of the canonical coronation of Mahal na Birhen ng Biglang-Awa (1958–2008). Cebu Archbishop-Cardinal Ricardo Vidal of Mogpog, Marinduque, officiated at the consecrated mass.\n\nBoac is the third largest of the six municipalities of the province of Marinduque, after Santa Cruz and Torrijos. It borders all the municipalities of the province: Mogpog to the north, Santa Cruz to the Northeast, Torrijos to the East, Buenavista to the South and Gasan to the South Southwest.\n\nThe municipality is generally hilly, rugged and mountainous in the south and eastern part with thin strips of flat and farm lands and long shoreline in the west. The longest and largest river, Boac River, which gets its source in the mountainous forest in the extreme southwest and spills off to the northern shore of Boac, divides the municipality into two geographical areas: north and south.\n\nThe closest town-to-town reference to Boac is the municipality of Mogpog which is approximately 5 kilometers. Boac is connected to Mogpog and Gasan by the Marinduque Circumferential Highway or the Pan-Marinduque Highway. Two bridges connect the north and south area of the municipality: the narrow Tabi Bridge which connects Barangay Tabi and Barangay San Miguel and the said-to-be the longest bridge in the province, Biglang Awa Bridge (186m), which connects Barangay Tampus and Barangay Bantad. A narrow minor road connects Boac and Mogpog via Buliasnin-Nangka Road, and Boac and Gasan via Duyay-Tapuyan Trail. Boac has a total road network of 117.61 kilometers.\n\nGeopolitically, Boac is divided into six zones: Poblacion, Riverside, Ilaya I, Ilaya II, Seaside A and Seaside B. Boac's geographical center is roughly located between the border of Barangay Binunga and Barangay Can-at.\n\nBoac is home to most of the province's commercial businesses. Barangays San Miguel, Murallon, and Mercado are the town's business district where the public market, medium-rise buildings, sports arena and Boac Town Arena, now Moriones Arena are. Meanwhile, Barangay Isok is home to the town's education district. Marinduque National High School, St. Mary's College of Marinduque, Don Luis Hidalgo Memorial School, Barangay Day Care Centers, Boac North District Office and the Division of Marinduque DepED Office is in Barangay Isok. The Municipal Building Hall is at Barangay Tampus, adjacent is the Marinduque Museum at Barangay Malusak.\n\nThe Marinduque Provincial Capitol is in Barangay Santol near the Dr. Damian Reyes Memorial Hospital (formerly Marinduque Provincial Hospital) and Camp Maximo Abad.\n\nBoac is politically divided into 61 barangays (administrative divisions) namely:\n\nAccording to the , the population of Boac is people, with a population density of 260 people per square kilometer. The most densely populated areas are in the Poblacion, northwest, and southwest barangays. Barangays in the eastern portions of the municipality are generally sparsely populated. Approximately 70% of the population lives along the national highways or within from the national road. Furthermore, approximately 5% of the total population lives in the town proper and 10% lives in the sub-urban barangays.\n\n\nIn the centre of town, the Boac Public Market is one of the town's landmarks. Vendors sell dry and wet products in four air-conditioned buildings. Transport terminals near the market carry goods to other barangays. It is considered to be the mini-supermarket of the province.\n\nThe poblacion area is called as Boac Central Business District (BCBD). The newly constructed two-floor Town Market with about 100 stores is in the heart of the poblacion.\n\nLocal fast food chains and restaurants include GoodChow Food Express, La Concha Restaurant, Kusina sa Plaza and many more.\n\nSeveral convenience and grocery stores includes CASHypermart, New Era, Jinang-Tan, Centro Market. Puregold Boac (Marinduque) Branch was scheduled to open in November 2015.\n\n\nBiglang-Awa Bridge is the longest bridge in the province, connecting Barangay Tampus to Barangay Bantad. Many people stand on the bridge to watch the sun set and to get a good view of the Boac Cathedral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The majority of Buenavistans trace their ancestry to the Don Cornelio Sadiua family.\n\nIn 1942, the Japanese Imperial forces landed in Buenavista at Patay Ilog before making their way to the capital. Due to its rugged terrain, relative isolation, and fierce pro-American sentiment, Buenavista was the headquarters for the resistance movement. Japanese forces and the Resistance and guerrillas frequently engaged in skirmishes within the town borders. Occupying Japanese forces burned the school and municipal building, after holding captives composed a member from each Buenavista family. Guerrilla forces eventually re-captured the town.\n\nThe 'Libas Ambush, known locally as \"Pinag Labanan\", was a joint guerrilla-Buenavistan effort in which Filipino guerrillas and Buenavistans ambushed and killed a troop of Japanese soldiers. After which the Japanese commandant issued a proclamation that for 1 Japanese soldier killed by the Filipinos in Buenavista, 10 Filipinos will die within a 5-mile radius.\n\nIn spite of the Japanese threats the Buenavistans continued their fight against Japanese occupation throughout the war, including rescuing and hiding several the combined Filipino and American military personnel during the war. One such rescue occurred shortly after the fall of Bataan, when the lighthouse keeper found an American seaman hiding among the shoreline rocks. These rescued Filipinos and Americans were clothed, fed and hidden by the Buenavistans, even though they risked execution if the Japanese found out about it.\n\nIn 1945, the combined U.S. and Allied Philippine Commonwealth military forces landed at Caigangan beach in Buenavista and attacked from the Japanese Imperial forces in the Battle of Marinduque. The Buenavista Campaign was the first major offensive fought during the Battle of Marinduque. It culminated in a bloody firefight between the Japanese and a joint Allied- Filipino guerrilla offensive. The Japanese, who were headquartered in the Municipal building and elementary school, were soundly defeated.\n\nBuenavista was chosen as the headquarters of the 5th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the U.S. Army Signal Corps due to their record of anti-Japanese actions during the war.

It is the second-oldest municipality in Marinduque, after Boac. Residents of Gasan are called \"Gaseños\".\n\nThe Tres Reyes Islands off the coast of Marinduque are under the jurisdiction of Gasan, part of the municipality's Barangay Pinggan.\n\nThe origin of the name of Gasan came from the term \"Gasang\" or \"Gasang-Gasang\", a type of coral once abundant around the town's shoreline. Legend has it that when the Spaniards discovered the town, they found an old woman near the banks of today's Matandang Gasan River. When asked in Spanish what was the name of the town, she interpreted it as if they were asking about what was the name of the corals growing around the area, with the Spaniards interpreting her answer as the name of the town. Over time, the term \"Gasang-Gasang\" was shortened to \"Gasang\" before being shortened further to Gasan.\n\nGasan is politically subdivided into 25 barangays.\n\nAll barangays in Gasan are bounded in part by coastline, except the mountainous barangays of Bachao Ilaya, Cabugao, Dawis, Mangiliol, Matandang Gasan, Tabionan, Tapuyan, and Tiguion, though Barangay Dawis is claiming that the coastline of Bukana, which is now controlled by Pinggan, belongs to them as well as the place itself.\n\nIn 1942, during World War II, the Japanese Imperial forces landed in Gasan, Marinduque.\n\nIn 1945, the combined United States and Allied Philippine Commonwealth forces landed in Gasan, Marinduque.

He is regarded as one of the fathers of the Football Association (FA) and modern football.\n\nMorley was born at 10 Garden Square, Princess Street in Hull to the Reverend Ebenezer Morley, a nonconformist minister, and his wife Hannah (née Cobb). He lived in the city until he was 22.\n\nMorley qualified as a lawyer in 1854. In 1858 he moved to the London suburb of Barnes to practise as a solicitor in the capital.\n\nMorley founded Barnes Football Club in 1862, and served as its captain until 1867.\n\nThe Barnes club played its first recorded game, a 2–0 victory, against Richmond F.C., on 29 November 1862. A match the following month against Blackheath FC went less happily: the Blackheath club played a rugby-style game, necessitating the adoption of compromise rules. \"Very weak\" play by Barnes resulted in a loss by two goals to nothing, with Morley narrowly escaping being \"garrotted\".\n\nIn 1863, Morley wrote to \"Bell's Life\" newspaper proposing a governing body for the sport, with the power to set common rules. This led to the first meeting of the FA at Freemasons' Tavern, on 26 October 1863. At this meeting, Morley was elected the first secretary of the association.\n\nAt this time, some football clubs followed the example of Rugby School by allowing the ball to be carried in the hands, with players allowed to \"hack\" (kick in the shins) opponents who were carrying the ball. Other clubs forbade both practices. During the meetings to draw up the FA laws, there was an acrimonious division between the \"hacking\" and \"non-hacking\" clubs. An FA meeting of 17 November 1863 discussed this question, with the \"hacking\" clubs predominating. A further meeting was scheduled in order to finalise (\"settle\") the laws, based on the draft created by Morley in his role as secretary.\n\nAt this crucial 24 November meeting, the \"hackers\" were again in a narrow majority. During the meeting, however, Morley brought the delegates' attention to a recently published set of football laws from Cambridge University which banned carrying and hacking. Discussion of the Cambridge rules, and suggestions for possible communication with Cambridge on the subject, served to delay the final \"settlement\" of the laws to a further meeting, on 1 December. A number of representatives who supported rugby-style football did not attend this additional meeting, resulting in hacking and carrying being banned in the laws that were published later that month.\n\nMorley played in the first ever match under FA rules, for Barnes against Richmond in December 1863. On 2 January 1864, Morley led his \"Secretary's Side\" to defeat against the \"President's Side\" in a friendly match at Battersea Park to test out the new laws.\n\nHe continued to serve as FA secretary until 1866. At that year's annual meeting, Morley resigned as FA secretary, citing the demands of business. He also objected to FA member clubs playing under any other rules, and made an unsuccessful proposal to abolish the offside law.\n\nEven though he was no longer FA secretary, Morley continued to be involved in football. He remained captain of Barnes FC, continued to serve on the FA's committee, and played for the \"London\" (FA) team in the London v Sheffield match held on 31 March 1866, scoring a goal.\n\nBy the time of the next FA annual meeting, in February 1867, the Association's future looked bleak. Membership had fallen to ten clubs, and founding president Arthur Pember needed to be replaced. Morley volunteered for the role, and was duly elected by the few club representatives in attendance.\n\nDuring the next year, the secretary Robert Graham attempted to increase membership by writing to every known club in the country. This increased membership to thirty by 1868, but did not prevent the association from running out of money, with the officers having to cover expenses out of their own pockets.\n\nMorley continued to serve as president until 1874, presiding over the birth of the FA Cup and a general increase in the popularity and influence of the Association. He was the first man to present the FA Cup, in 1872.\n\nWhen the FA celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1913, Morley, the most prominent founder of the association who was still living, was a notable guest at the festivities. He was presented with a silver cigar-case at a dinner held at the King's Hall, Holborn in central London.\n\nMorley was also active in the sport of rowing. Immediately upon moving to Barnes in 1858, he participated in the Barnes and Mortlake Regatta of that year, served as the treasurer of the Regatta in 1860, and as secretary from 1862 to 1870. Morley was associated with the London Rowing Club from 1860. In 1864, he competed as a member of that club's eight in the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley.\n\nMorley continued to row long after he had ceased his work with the Football Association. In 1913, it was reported that the octogenarian was still \"sculling daily in his well-known boat\".\n\nMorley was also a keen fox hunter, keeping his own pack of beagles.\n\nMorley worked as a solicitor, handling such matters as mortgages and wills.\n\nMorley served as agent to the Radical Member of Parliament Donald Nicoll, who served as Member of Parliament for Frome from 1857 to 1859. Following Nicoll's defeat in the 1859 United Kingdom general election, Morley was caught up in a controversy over a petition, later withdrawn, to have the election result overturned because of \"bribery, treating, and undue influence\".\n\nMorley served on Surrey County Council for Barnes (1903–1919) and was a Justice of the Peace.\n\nMorley's wife, Frances, died of pneumonia in 1911. Morley himself succumbed to the same condition in 1924. He was buried in Barnes Cemetery, a now abandoned graveyard on Barnes Common, Barnes. He had no children.\n\nThe house at which Morley created the first draft of the FA's laws (No 26 The Terrace) carried a blue plaque to Morley. It subsequently collapsed \"like a tower of cards\" in November 2015 during building work.\n\nMorley was the subject of a Google Doodle on 16 August 2018, the 187th anniversary of his birth. \n"}

It has the largest collection of ancient First Nations petroglyphs (rock carvings) in Ontario. The carvings were created in the pre-Columbian era and represents aspects of First Nations spirituality, including images of shamans, animals, reptiles, and, possibly, the Great Spirit itself.\n\nThe location of the site was kept hidden from non-First Nation people until 1954, when it was rediscovered accidentally by a prospector (Everett Davis) of the Industrial Minerals of Canada. The immediate area of the petroglyphs has been designated a National Historic Site of Canada.\n\nThe stone is generally believed to have been carved by the Algonquian or Iroquian speaking people between 900 and 1100 AD., if not somewhat earlier during the Archaic. Today, the First Nations people of Ontario call the carvings Kinomagewapkong, meaning \"the rocks that teach\" or \"the Teaching Rocks\". Originally two to three inches deep the 1200 carvings were made using gneiss hammers to incise human figures, animals, and a dominant figure whose head apparently represents the sun, onto the soft, gently sloping walls.\n\nThe petroglyphs were first thoroughly recorded in 1965 and 1968 by Joan Vastokas of the University of Toronto and Ron Vastokas of Trent University in Peterborough. Their book, \"Sacred Art of the Algonkians\", is considered by rock art scholars the most definitive study and interpretation to date.\nAccording to the Learning Center, while the glyphs are important, they are not the primary reason this site is sacred. The rock site itself is a sacred place. And today is a place of pilgrimage for local Ojibwe people. The deep crevices in the rock are believed to lead to the spirit world, as there is an underground trickle of water that runs beneath the rock which produces sounds interpreted by aboriginal people as those of the Spirits speaking to them.\n\nAlthough officially a Historical Class park, the petroglyphs themselves are actually concentrated in a relatively small area of the park. The rest consists of primarily woodland habitat home to several provincially rare species, such as the five-lined skink, \"Eumeces fasciatus\".\nAs the park also borders the nearby Peterborough Crown Game Reserve a number of animals indigenous to the area may also be spotted including: beavers, otters, white-tailed deer, squirrels, chipmunks and the occasional wolf. A great number of birds can also be spotted including: wild turkeys, woodpeckers, grouse, hawks, jays and eagles.\n\nThe park is open 10 am to 5 pm daily (excepting Mondays and Tuesdays in the spring and fall) from the second Friday in May to Thanksgiving. The park's visitor centre is known as the Learning Place, and opened in 2002. The centre is managed by Curve Lake First Nation, and features displays about the petroglyphs and their spiritual significance to the First Nations people. A movie \"The Teaching Rocks\" is shown daily, upon request and during evening programs. There is also a children's hands-on activity room and a gift shop.\n\nThe rock carvings are covered by a protective building, and there are interpretive plaques and guides at the site. \nPhotographing and videotaping the rock carvings is not permitted for spiritual reasons, and dogs are not allowed inside any of the buildings.\n\n\n"}

He took up and continued a \"Chronicon Anglicanum\" belonging to his house; the original work begins at 1066, his own share at 1187. He hoped to reach the year 1227, but his autograph copy breaks off three years earlier.\n\nRalph makes no pretensions to be a literary artist. Where he had a written authority before him he was content to reproduce even the phraseology of his original. At other times he strings together in chronological order, without any links of connection, the anecdotes which he gathered from chance visitors.\n\nUnlike Benedictus Abbas and Roger of Hoveden, he makes little use of documents; only three letters are quoted in his work. On the other hand, the corrections and erasures of the autograph show that he took pains to verify his details; and his informants are sometimes worthy of exceptional confidence. Thus he vouches Richard's chaplain Anselm for the story of the king's capture by Leopold of Austria.\n\nThe tone of the chronicle is usually dispassionate; but the original text contained some personal strictures upon Prince John, which are reproduced in Roger of Wendover. The admiration with which Ralph regarded Henry II is attested by his edition of Ralph Niger's chronicle; here, under the year 1161, he replies to the intemperate criticisms of the original author. On Richard I the abbot passes a judicious verdict, admitting the great qualities of that king, but arguing that his character degenerated. Towards John alone Ralph is uniformly hostile; as a Cistercian and an adherent of the Mandeville family he could hardly be otherwise.\n\nRalph refers in the \"Chronicon\" (s.a. 1091) to a book of visions and miracles which he had compiled, but this is no longer extant. He also wrote a continuation of Niger's chronicle, extending from 1162 to 1178 (printed in R. Anstruther's edition of Niger, London, 1851), and short annals from 1066 to 1223.\n\nThe autograph manuscript of the \"Chronicon Anglicanum\" is to be found in the British Library (Cotton, Vespasian D. X). The same volume contains the continuation of Ralph Niger. The \"Chronicon Terrae Sanctae\", formerly attributed to Ralph, is by another hand; it was among the sources on which he drew for the \"Chronicon Anglicanum\". The so-called \"Libellus de motibus anglicanis sub rege Johanne\" (printed by Martène and Durand, \"Ampl. Collectio\", v. pp. 871–882) is merely an excerpt from the \"Chronicon Anglicanum\". This latter work was edited for the Rolls series in 1875 by Joseph Stevenson.\n\n"}

He began to draw early and in 1838 he enrolled as a student of professor Karl Rabus (1800-1857) at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (MSPSA). He graduated in 1850 and immediately began to specialize in landscape painting.\n\nIn 1852, he traveled to Ukraine. Then, in 1854 by the invitation of the Grand Duchess Maria Nikolayevna, President of the Imperial Academy of Arts, he moved to the neighborhood of St. Petersburg. In 1857, Savrasov became a teacher at the MSPSA. His best students, Isaac Levitan and Konstantin Korovin, remembered their teacher with admiration and gratitude.\n\nIn 1857, he married Sophia Karlovna Hertz, sister of the art historian Karl Hertz (1820-1883). In their home they entertained artistic people and collectors including Pavel Tretyakov. Savrasov became especially close with Vasily Perov. Perov helped him paint the figures of the boat trackers in Savrasov's \"Volga near Yuryevets\", Savrasov painted landscapes for Perov's \"Bird catcher\" and \"Hunters on Bivouac\".\n\nIn the 1860s, he traveled to England to see the International Exhibition, and to Switzerland. In one of his letters he wrote that \"no academies in the world could so advance an artist as the present world exhibition\". The painters who influenced him most were British painter John Constable and Swiss painter Alexandre Calame.\n\n\"The Rooks Have Come Back\" (1871) is considered by many critics to be the high point in Savrasov’s artistic career. Using a common, even trivial, episode of birds returning home, and an extremely simple landscape, Savrasov emotionally showed the transition of nature from winter to spring. It was a new type of \"lyrical landscape\" painting, called later by critics \"the mood landscape\". The painting brought him fame. In 1870, he became a member of the Peredvizhniki group, breaking with government-sponsored academic art.\n\nIn the late 1870s, he gradually became an alcoholic. The process may have begun with the death of his daughter in 1871, which led to a crisis in his art and, possibly, dissatisfaction with his artistic career. In 1882, he was dismissed from his position at the MSPSA. All attempts of his relatives and friends to help him were in vain.\n\nHis work suffered dramatically and the last years of his life were spent in poverty. He was usually drunk and often dressed in rags. Finally, he found himself wandering from shelter to shelter. Only the doorkeeper of the MSPSA and Pavel Tretyakov, founder of the Tretyakov Gallery, were present at his funeral in 1897.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1927, the British Air Ministry issued Specification 26/27 for a DH.9A replacement which, to save money, had to use as many components of the DH.9A as possible because the RAF held large stocks of DH.9A spares. Vickers submitted the Type 131 design to the Ministry but, as it did not make use of the required DH9A components, did not receive a contract for a prototype. However Vickers decided to build a single prototype as a private venture for evaluation against the specification.\n\nThe Vickers 131 Valiant was a single-bay biplane of all-metal construction, sharing much of the structure with the Vivid. It was powered by a 492 hp (367 kW) Bristol Jupiter engine, and the crew of two sat in separate but adjacent cockpits, giving good communication between the pilot and observer. It could carry up to 500 lb (230 kg) of bombs under the wing, with a fixed Vickers machine gun for the pilot and a Lewis gun on a Scarff ring for the observer.\n\nThe prototype had made its first flight by 5 March 1927, and underwent official evaluation against the designs from Bristol (the Beaver), Fairey (the Fairey Ferret and IIIF), Gloster (the Goral) and Westland (the Wapiti). Its initial tests showed it to possess good handling, and was taken forwards for squadron trials, along with the Ferret, IIIF and Wapiti. Following these trials, the Wapiti was chosen as the winner, with the Valiant, which was 30% more expensive than the Wapiti, rejected because it was a poor bombing platform, not being sufficiently stable.\n\nThe Valiant was shipped to Chile in 1928 for demonstration to the Chilean Air Force that wanted a replacement for their Vixens. While no production followed, Chile purchased the prototype, which entered service with the School of Aviation, being destroyed in a crash on 29 March 1929.\n\n\n"}

Boylston is known for holding several \"firsts\" for an American-born physician: he performed the first surgical operation by an American physician, the first removal of gall bladder stones in 1710, and the first removal of a breast tumor in 1718.

That idea was substantiated by letters published from Emmanuel Timoni, a physician to Great Britain's ambassador to Turkey. During a smallpox outbreak in 1721 in Boston, Boylston inoculated two slaves and his own son, who was 13 at the time, by applying pus from a smallpox sore to a small wound on the subjects, the method previously used in Africa. This was the first introduction of inoculations to North America. \n\nHis method was initially met by hostility and outright violence from other physicians, and many threats were made on his life, with some even threatening to hang him on the nearest tree. He was forced to hide in a private place of his house for 14 days, a secret known only by his wife. After his initial inoculations of his son and two slaves, he was arrested for a short period of time for it (he was later released with the promise not to inoculate without government permission). During this hostility, his family was also in a dangerous situation. His wife and children were sitting in their home and a lighted hand-grenade was thrown into the room, but the fuse fell off before an explosion could take place. Even after the violence had subsided, he visited his patients only at midnight and while disguised. He inoculated about 248 people.\n\nIn 1724, with a letter of introduction to Dr. James Jurin by Cotton Mather, Boylston traveled to London, where he published his results as \"Historical Account of the Small-Pox Inoculated in New England\", and he became a fellow of the Royal Society two years later.

L. Toole's and Helena Modjeska's companies from 1883, Waller became known, by the late 1880s, for romantic leads, both in Shakespeare and in popular costume dramas of the Victorian and Edwardian eras. He attracted a large number of female admirers, who formed themselves into a vocal and conspicuous fan club. He also tried his hand at management of tours in 1885 and 1893 and then became an actor-manager at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket in the mid-1890s. After the turn of the century, he returned to management, and remained an actor-manager for the rest of his career, both in London and on tour.\n\nDespite his commercial success in such parts as the title roles in Booth Tarkington's \"Monsieur Beaucaire\" and Arthur Conan Doyle's \"Brigadier Gerard\", Waller greatly preferred acting in Shakespeare, in which his roles ranged from Romeo to Othello. Among the roles he created was Sir Robert Chiltern in Oscar Wilde's 1895 comedy \"An Ideal Husband\".\n\nWaller was born in Bilbao, Spain, the eldest son of an English civil engineer, William James Lewis, and his wife, Carlotta \"née\" Vyse. He was educated at King's College School in south west London, after which, intending to pursue a commercial career, he studied languages on the continent. From 1879 to 1883 he was a clerk in a London firm owned by his uncle.\nAfter acting in amateur performances, Waller decided to make a career on the stage and was engaged by J. L. Toole in 1883. His first role was the Hon. Claude Lorrimer in H. J. Byron's \"Uncle Dick's Darling\", in which he was billed as \"Waller Lewis\". By May of the same year, he had adopted the stage name Lewis Waller. In that month he appeared at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in a charity matinee for the Actors' Benevolent Fund with Toole's company and such contemporary stars as Rutland Barrington, Lionel Brough, Arthur Cecil, Nellie Farren, George Grossmith, Henry Irving and Ellen Terry. He remained in Toole's company for a year, playing light comedy and juvenile parts. During this year, he married a young actress, Florence West (1862–1912). He joined a touring company, playing the central role, the blind Gilbert Vaughan, in \"Called Back\" by Hugh Conway, dramatised by J. Comyns Carr. He returned to London in March 1885 to play at the Lyceum Theatre in Helena Modjeska's company, as the Abbé in \"Adrienne Lecouvreur\", and then toured with her, playing such roles as Mortimer in \"Mary Stuart\" and Orlando in \"As You Like It\"; \"The Manchester Guardian\" said of the latter that he \"kept Orlando properly ingenuous, and made him a taking and gallant young wooer.\"\n\nTowards the end of 1885, Waller ventured into management for the first time, touring a production of \"Called Back\", switching to the role of Dr. Basil North, in which \"The Manchester Guardian\" thought him \"a trifle too melodramatic\". The tour was modestly successful, but not such as to lead Waller to mount further productions for the moment.\n\nWaller returned to the West End, working for a succession of managements. At the Strand Theatre in early 1887, he played Roy Carlton in \"Jack-in-the-Box\", which his biographer in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" describes as his first substantial success in London. At the Opera Comique he played Ernest Vane in \"Masks and Faces\" and Captain Absolute in \"The Rivals\"; and at the Gaiety Theatre he played Jacques Rosney in \"Civil War\".\nWaller then joined William Hunter Kendal and John Hare at the St. James's Theatre, where he played the Duc de Bligny in \"The Ironmaster\", Sir George Barclay in \"Lady Clancarty\", and Lord Arden in \"The Wife's Secret\". When Rutland Barrington took over the management of the St. James's in 1888, Waller played George Sabine in \"The Dean's Daughter\" and Ralph Crampton in \"Brantinghame Hall\". Rudolph de Cordova, in a 1909 biographical sketch notes, \"During this period, few theatres played regular afternoon performances, so that the actors were, for the most part, engaged only in the evening. Many matinees were, however, given to introduce new plays and new players; and in this way Mr. Waller acted a large number of new parts, all of an ephemeral character.\" In particular he played several Ibsen roles in these matinees in the early 1890s, bringing him to the attention of people of influence in the theatre such as William Archer, Jacob Grein and Bernard Shaw. Waller played Oswald in \"Ghosts\", Lovborg in \"Hedda Gabler\", Rosmer in \"Rosmersholm\" and Solness in \"The Master Builder\". The ODNB comments that Archer was \"delighted that an established West End actor had contributed to the Ibsen revival but was aware that Waller could overcome neither the plays' inadequate rehearsal period nor his background of florid West End performances.\"\nIn October 1893 Waller returned to management, mounting a tour of Wilde's \"A Woman of No Importance\", in which he played Lord Illingworth. \"The Manchester Guardian\" called it \"a tolerable travelling company in which nobody gains great distinction.\" Returning to London, Waller, in partnership with H. H. Morrell, leased the Theatre Royal, Haymarket while its regular tenant, Herbert Beerbohm Tree was on tour in the US. He began with the premiere of Wilde's \"An Ideal Husband\", playing Sir Robert Chiltern in a cast that included his wife as Mrs. Cheveley, Julia Neilson as Lady Chiltern and Charles Hawtrey as Lord Goring. Waller and Morrell remained in management until 1897, when Tree invited Waller to join his company at the newly rebuilt Her Majesty's Theatre.\n\nWaller remained with Tree for three years, playing a wide range of roles, including romantic leads in popular costume dramas and, in Tree's lavish Shakespeare productions, Laertes in \"Hamlet\", Brutus in \"Julius Caesar\", Faulconbridge in \"King John\" and Lysander in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\".\n\nAfter leaving Tree's company, Waller returned to management, and remained an actor-manager for the rest of his career. Although he loved playing Shakespeare, adding the roles of Romeo, Othello and Henry V to his repertoire, for commercial reasons he was best known as the star of swashbuckling romances. He was particularly identified with the title roles in the stage versions of Booth Tarkington's \"Monsieur Beaucaire\" and Arthur Conan Doyle's \"Brigadier Gerard\". He starred in a film of the latter in 1915.\n\nThe critic Hesketh Pearson praised Waller for \"his good looks [and] his virile acting and his vibrant voice\" which \"rang through the theatre like a bell and stirred like a trumpet\". Waller had a large following of enthusiastic women fans, who formed a club known as the K.O.W. [Keen On Waller] Brigade. Pearson lamented, \"the puerile nature of the plays he usually put on, and the adolescent behaviour of his female admirers, prevented many people from appreciating his superb gift as a declaimer of Shakespeare's rhetoric, and frequently exposed him to ridicule.\"\n\nIn 1911 and 1912, Waller made a tour of the US, Canada and Australia. In his absence his wife died. His last play was May Martindale's \"Gamblers All\", which opened at Wyndham's Theatre, London in June 1915, with Gerald du Maurier and Madge Titheradge co-starring. \"The Manchester Guardian\" called the production \"a personal acting triumph for Lewis Waller\". After the West End run, Waller took the play on tour, during which he contracted pneumonia, from which he died in Nottingham two days short of his 55th birthday.\n\nWaller made a small number of recordings for the Gramophone Company:\n\nRecorded 3 January 1907:\n\n\nRecorded 4 August 1911:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2118736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118736", "title": "Domestication of animals", "text": "Domestication of animals\n\nThe domestication of animals is the mutual relationship between animals and the humans who have influence on their care and reproduction. Charles Darwin recognized a small number of traits that made domesticated species different from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious selective breeding in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of natural selection or from selection on other traits. There is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations. There is also a genetic difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations. Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates, and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations.\n\nDomestication should not be confused with taming. Taming is the conditioned behavioral modification of a wild-born animal when its natural avoidance of humans is reduced and it accepts the presence of humans, but domestication is the permanent genetic modification of a bred lineage that leads to an inherited predisposition toward humans. Certain animal species, and certain individuals within those species, make better candidates for domestication than others because they exhibit certain behavioral characteristics: (1) the size and organization of their social structure; (2) the availability and the degree of selectivity in their choice of mates; (3) the ease and speed with which the parents bond with their young, and the maturity and mobility of the young at birth; (4) the degree of flexibility in diet and habitat tolerance; and (5) responses to humans and new environments, including flight responses and reactivity to external stimuli.\n\nIt is proposed that there were three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama, alpaca, and turkey); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel). The dog was the first to be domesticated, and was established across Eurasia before the end of the Late Pleistocene era, well before cultivation and before the domestication of other animals. Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors. The archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks – including donkeys, horses, New and Old World camelids, goats, sheep, and pigs – was common. One study has concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars into pigs and created domestication islands in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.\n\nDomestication has been defined as \"a sustained multi-generational, mutualistic relationship in which one organism assumes a significant degree of influence over the reproduction and care of another organism in order to secure a more predictable supply of a resource of interest, and through which the partner organism gains advantage over individuals that remain outside this relationship, thereby benefitting and often increasing the fitness of both the domesticator and the target domesticate.\" This definition recognizes both the biological and the cultural components of the domestication process and the effects on both humans and the domesticated animals and plants. All past definitions of domestication have included a relationship between humans with plants and animals, but their differences lay in who was considered as the lead partner in the relationship. This new definition recognizes a mutualistic relationship in which both partners gain benefits. Domestication has vastly enhanced the reproductive output of crop plants, livestock, and pets far beyond that of their wild progenitors. Domesticates have provided humans with resources that they could more predictably and securely control, move, and redistribute, which has been the advantage that had fueled a population explosion of the agro-pastoralists and their spread to all corners of the planet.\n\nThis biological mutualism is not restricted to humans with domestic crops and livestock but is well-documented in nonhuman species, especially among a number of social insect domesticators and their plant and animal domesticates, for example the ant–fungus mutualism that exists between leafcutter ants and certain fungi.\n\nDomestication syndrome is a term often used to describe the suite of phenotypic traits arising during domestication that distinguish crops from their wild ancestors. The term is also applied to animals and includes increased docility and tameness, coat color changes, reductions in tooth size, changes in craniofacial morphology, alterations in ear and tail form (e.g., floppy ears), more frequent and nonseasonal estrus cycles, alterations in adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, changed concentrations of several neurotransmitters, prolongations in juvenile behavior, and reductions in both total brain size and of particular brain regions.\n\nDomestication should not be confused with taming. Taming is the conditioned behavioral modification of a wild-born animal when its natural avoidance of humans is reduced and it accepts the presence of humans, but domestication is the permanent genetic modification of a bred lineage that leads to an inherited predisposition toward humans. Human selection included tameness, but without a suitable evolutionary response then domestication was not achieved. Domestic animals need not be tame in the behavioral sense, such as the Spanish fighting bull. Wild animals can be tame, such as a hand-raised cheetah. A domestic animal's breeding is controlled by humans and its tameness and tolerance of humans is genetically determined. However, an animal merely bred in captivity is not necessarily domesticated. Tigers, gorillas, and polar bears breed readily in captivity but are not domesticated. Asian elephants are wild animals that with taming manifest outward signs of domestication, yet their breeding is not human controlled and thus they are not true domesticates.\n\nThe domestication of animals and plants was triggered by the climatic and environmental changes that occurred after the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum around 21,000 years ago and which continue to this present day. These changes made obtaining food difficult. The first domesticate was the wolf (\"Canis lupus\") at least 15,000 years ago. The Younger Dryas that occurred 12,900 years ago was a period of intense cold and aridity that put pressure on humans to intensify their foraging strategies. By the beginning of the Holocene from 11,700 years ago, favorable climatic conditions and increasing human populations led to small-scale animal and plant domestication, which allowed humans to augment the food that they were obtaining through hunter-gathering.\n\nThe Neolithic transition led to agricultural societies emerging in locations across Eurasia, North Africa, and South and Central America. In the Fertile Crescent 10,000-11,000 years ago, zooarchaeology indicates that goats, pigs, sheep, and taurine cattle were the first livestock to be domesticated. Two thousand years later, humped zebu cattle were domesticated in what is today Baluchistan in Pakistan. In East Asia 8,000 years ago, pigs were domesticated from wild boar that were genetically different from those found in the Fertile Crescent. The horse was domesticated on the Central Asian steppe 5,500 years ago. Both the chicken in Southeast Asia and the cat in Egypt were domesticated 4,000 years ago.\n\nThe sudden appearance of the domestic dog (\"Canis lupus familiaris\") in the archaeological record then led to a rapid shift in the evolution, ecology, and demography of both humans and numerous species of animals and plants. It was followed by livestock and crop domestication, and the transition of humans from foraging to farming in different places and times across the planet. Around 10,000 YBP, a new way of life emerged for humans through the management and exploitation of plant and animal species, leading to higher-density populations in the centers of domestication, the expansion of agricultural economies, and the development of urban communities.\n\nThe biomass of wild vertebrates is now increasingly small compared to the biomass of domestic animals, with the calculated biomass of domestic cattle alone being greater than that of all wild mammals. Because the evolution of domestic animals is ongoing, the process of domestication has a beginning but not an end. Various criteria have been established to provide a definition of domestic animals, but all decisions about exactly when an animal can be labelled \"domesticated\" in the zoological sense are arbitrary, although potentially useful.\nDomestication is a fluid and nonlinear process that may start, stop, reverse, or go down unexpected paths with no clear or universal threshold that separates the wild from the domestic. However, there are universal features held in common by all domesticated animals.\n\nCertain animal species, and certain individuals within those species, make better candidates for domestication than others because they exhibit certain behavioral characteristics: (1) the size and organization of their social structure; (2) the availability and the degree of selectivity in their choice of mates; (3) the ease and speed with which the parents bond with their young, and the maturity and mobility of the young at birth; (4) the degree of flexibility in diet and habitat tolerance; and (5) responses to humans and new environments, including flight responses and reactivity to external stimuli. Reduced wariness to humans and low reactivity to both humans and other external stimuli are a key pre-adaptation for domestication, and these behaviors are also the primary target of the selective pressures experienced by the animal undergoing domestication. This implies that not all animals can be domesticated, e.g. a wild member of the horse family, the Zebra.\n\nJared Diamond in his book \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\" enquired as to why, among the world's 148 large wild terrestrial herbivorous mammals, only 14 were domesticated, and proposed that their wild ancestors must have possessed six characteristics before they could be considered for domestication:\n\nThe sustained selection for lowered reactivity among mammal domesticates has resulted in profound changes in brain form and function. The larger the size of the brain to begin with and the greater its degree of folding, the greater the degree of brain-size reduction under domestication. Foxes that had been selectively bred for tameness over 40 years had experienced a significant reduction in cranial height and width and by inference in brain size, which supports the hypothesis that brain-size reduction is an early response to the selective pressure for tameness and lowered reactivity that is the universal feature of animal domestication. The most affected portion of the brain in domestic mammals is the limbic system, which in domestic dogs, pigs, and sheep show a 40% reduction in size compared with their wild species. This portion of the brain regulates endocrine function that influences behaviors such as aggression, wariness, and responses to environmentally induced stress, all attributes which are dramatically affected by domestication.\n\nA putative cause for the broad changes seen in domestication syndrome is pleiotropy. Pleiotropy occurs when one gene influences two or more seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. Certain physiological changes characterize domestic animals of many species. These changes include extensive white markings (particularly on the head), floppy ears, and curly tails. These arise even when tameness is the only trait under selective pressure. The genes involved in tameness are largely unknown, so it is not known how or to what extent pleiotropy contributes to domestication syndrome. Tameness may be caused by the down regulation of fear and stress responses via reduction of the adrenal glands. Based on this, the pleiotropy hypotheses can be separated into two theories. The Neural Crest Hypothesis relates adrenal gland function to deficits in neural crest cells during development. The Single Genetic Regulatory Network Hypothesis claims that genetic changes in upstream regulators affect downstream systems.\n\nNeural crest cells (NCC) are vertebrate embryonic stem cells that function directly and indirectly during early embryogenesis to produce many tissue types. Because the traits commonly affected by domestication syndrome are all derived from NCC in development, the neural crest hypothesis suggests that deficits in these cells cause the domain of phenotypes seen in domestication syndrome. These deficits could cause changes we see to many domestic mammals, such as lopped ears (seen in rabbit, dog, fox, pig, sheep, goat, cattle, and donkeys) as well as curly tails (pigs, foxes, and dogs). Although they do not affect the development of the adrenal cortex directly, the neural crest cells may be involved in relevant upstream embryological interactions. Furthermore, artificial selection targeting tameness may affect genes that control the concentration or movement of NCCs in the embryo, leading to a variety of phenotypes.\n\nThe single genetic regulatory network hypothesis proposes that domestication syndrome results from mutations in genes that regulate the expression pattern of more downstream genes. For example piebald, or spotted coat coloration, may be caused by a linkage in the biochemical pathways of melanins involved in coat coloration and neurotransmitters such as dopamine that help shape behavior and cognition. These linked traits may arise from mutations in a few key regulatory genes. A problem with this hypothesis is that it proposes that there are mutations in gene networks that cause dramatic effects that are not lethal, however no currently known genetic regulatory networks cause such dramatic change in so many different traits.\n\nFeral mammals such as dogs, cats, goats, donkeys, pigs, and ferrets that have lived apart from humans for generations show no sign of regaining the brain mass of their wild progenitors. Dingos have lived apart from humans for thousands of years but still have the same brain size as that of a domestic dog. Feral dogs that actively avoid human contact are still dependent on human waste for survival and have not reverted to the self-sustaining behaviors of their wolf ancestors.\n\nDomestication can be considered as the final phase of intensification in the relationship between animal or plant sub-populations and human societies, but it is divided into several grades of intensification. For studies in animal domestication, researchers have proposed five distinct categories: wild, captive wild, domestic, cross-breeds and feral.\n\n\nIn 2015, a study compared the diversity of dental size, shape and allometry across the proposed domestication categories of modern pigs (genus \"Sus\"). The study showed clear differences between the dental phenotypes of wild, captive wild, domestic, and hybrid pig populations, which supported the proposed categories through physical evidence. The study did not cover feral pig populations but called for further research to be undertaken on them, and on the genetic differences with hybrid pigs.\n\nSince 2012, a multi-stage model of animal domestication has been accepted by two groups. The first group proposed that animal domestication proceeded along a continuum of stages from anthropophily, commensalism, control in the wild, control of captive animals, extensive breeding, intensive breeding, and finally to pets in a slow, gradually intensifying relationship between humans and animals.\n\nThe second group proposed that there were three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel). The beginnings of animal domestication involved a protracted coevolutionary process with multiple stages along different pathways. Humans did not intend to domesticate animals from, or at least they did not envision a domesticated animal resulting from, either the commensal or prey pathways. In both of these cases, humans became entangled with these species as the relationship between them, and the human role in their survival and reproduction, intensified. Although the directed pathway proceeded from capture to taming, the other two pathways are not as goal-oriented and archaeological records suggest that they take place over much longer time frames.\n\nThe commensal pathway was traveled by vertebrates that fed on refuse around human habitats or by animals that preyed on other animals drawn to human camps. Those animals established a commensal relationship with humans in which the animals benefited but the humans received no harm but little benefit. Those animals that were most capable of taking advantage of the resources associated with human camps would have been the tamer, less aggressive individuals with shorter fight or flight distances. Later, these animals developed closer social or economic bonds with humans that led to a domestic relationship. The leap from a synanthropic population to a domestic one could only have taken place after the animals had progressed from anthropophily to habituation, to commensalism and partnership, when the relationship between animal and human would have laid the foundation for domestication, including captivity and human-controlled breeding. From this perspective, animal domestication is a coevolutionary process in which a population responds to selective pressure while adapting to a novel niche that included another species with evolving behaviors. Commensal pathway animals include dogs, cats, fowl, and possibly pigs.\n\nThe domestication of animals commenced over 15,000 years before present (YBP), beginning with the grey wolf (\"Canis lupus\") by nomadic hunter-gatherers. It was not until 11,000 YBP that people living in the Near East entered into relationships with wild populations of aurochs, boar, sheep, and goats. A domestication process then began to develop. The grey wolf most likely followed the commensal pathway to domestication. When, where, and how many times wolves may have been domesticated remains debated because only a small number of ancient specimens have been found, and both archaeology and genetics continue to provide conflicting evidence. The most widely accepted, earliest dog remains date back 15,000 YBP to the Bonn–Oberkassel dog. Earlier remains dating back to 30,000 YBP have been described as Paleolithic dogs, however their status as dogs or wolves remains debated. Recent studies indicate that a genetic divergence occurred between dogs and wolves 20,000–40,000 YBP, however this is the upper time-limit for domestication because it represents the time of divergence and not the time of domestication.\n\nThe chicken is one of the most widespread domesticated species and one of the human world's largest sources of protein. Although the chicken was domesticated in South-East Asia, archaeological evidence suggests that it was not kept as a livestock species until 400 BCE in the Levant. Prior to this, chickens had been associated with humans for thousands of years and kept for cock-fighting, rituals, and royal zoos, so they were not originally a prey species. The chicken was not a popular food in Europe until only one thousand years ago.\n\nThe prey pathway was the way in which most major livestock species entered into domestication as these were once hunted by humans for their meat. Domestication was likely initiated when humans began to experiment with hunting strategies designed to increase the availability of these prey, perhaps as a response to localized pressure on the supply of the animal. Over time and with the more responsive species, these game-management strategies developed into herd-management strategies that included the sustained multi-generational control over the animals’ movement, feeding, and reproduction. As human interference in the life-cycles of prey animals intensified, the evolutionary pressures for a lack of aggression would have led to an acquisition of the same domestication syndrome traits found in the commensal domesticates.\n\nPrey pathway animals include sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca. The right conditions for the domestication for some of them appear to have been in place in the central and eastern Fertile Crescent at the end of the Younger Dryas climatic downturn and the beginning of the Early Holocene about 11,700 YBP, and by 10,000 YBP people were preferentially killing young males of a variety of species and allowed the females to live in order to produce more offspring. By measuring the size, sex ratios, and mortality profiles of zooarchaeological specimens, archeologists have been able to document changes in the management strategies of hunted sheep, goats, pigs, and cows in the Fertile Crescent starting 11,700 YBP. A recent demographic and metrical study of cow and pig remains at Sha’ar Hagolan, Israel, demonstrated that both species were severely overhunted before domestication, suggesting that the intensive exploitation led to management strategies adopted throughout the region that ultimately led to the domestication of these populations following the prey pathway. This pattern of overhunting before domestication suggests that the prey pathway was as accidental and unintentional as the commensal pathway.\n\nThe directed pathway was a more deliberate and directed process initiated by humans with the goal of domesticating a free-living animal. It probably only came into being once people were familiar with either commensal or prey-pathway domesticated animals. These animals were likely not to possess many of the behavioral preadaptions some species show before domestication. Therefore, the domestication of these animals requires more deliberate effort by humans to work around behaviors that do not assist domestication, with increased technological assistance needed.\n\nHumans were already reliant on domestic plants and animals when they imagined the domestic versions of wild animals. Although horses, donkeys, and Old World camels were sometimes hunted as prey species, they were each deliberately brought into the human niche for sources of transport. Domestication was still a multi-generational adaptation to human selection pressures, including tameness, but without a suitable evolutionary response then domestication was not achieved. For example, despite the fact that hunters of the Near Eastern gazelle in the Epipaleolithic avoided culling reproductive females to promote population balance, neither gazelles nor zebras possessed the necessary prerequisites and were never domesticated. There is no clear evidence for the domestication of any herded prey animal originating in Africa.\n\nThe pathways that animals may have followed are not mutually exclusive. Pigs, for example, may have been domesticated as their populations became accustomed to the human niche, which would suggest a commensal pathway, or they may have been hunted and followed a prey pathway, or both.\n\nAs agricultural societies migrated away from the domestication centers taking their domestic partners with them, they encountered populations of wild animals of the same or sister species. Because domestics often shared a recent common ancestor with the wild populations, they were capable of producing fertile offspring. Domestic populations were small relative to the surrounding wild populations, and repeated hybridizations between the two eventually led to the domestic population becoming more genetically divergent from its original domestic source population.\n\nAdvances in DNA sequencing technology allow the nuclear genome to be accessed and analyzed in a population genetics framework. The increased resolution of nuclear sequences has demonstrated that gene flow is common, not only between geographically diverse domestic populations of the same species but also between domestic populations and wild species that never gave rise to a domestic population.\nThe archaeological and genetic data suggests that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks – including canids, donkeys, horses, New and Old World camelids, goats, sheep, and pigs – was common. Bidirectional gene flow between domestic and wild reindeer continues today.\n\nThe consequence of this introgression is that modern domestic populations can often appear to have much greater genomic affinity to wild populations that were never involved in the original domestication process. Therefore, it is proposed that the term \"domestication\" should be reserved solely for the initial process of domestication of a discrete population in time and space. Subsequent admixture between introduced domestic populations and local wild populations that were never domesticated should be referred to as \"introgressive capture\". Conflating these two processes muddles our understanding of the original process and can lead to an artificial inflation of the number of times domestication took place. This introgression can, in some cases, be regarded as adaptive introgression, as observed in domestic sheep due to gene flow with the wild European Mouflon.\n\nThe sustained admixture between different dog and wolf populations across the Old and New Worlds over at least the last 10,000 years has blurred the genetic signatures and confounded efforts of researchers at pinpointing the origins of dogs. None of the modern wolf populations are related to the Pleistocene wolves that were first domesticated, and the extinction of the wolves that were the direct ancestors of dogs has muddied efforts to pinpoint the time and place of dog domestication.\n\nCharles Darwin recognized the small number of traits that made domestic species different from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious selective breeding in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of natural selection or from selection on other traits. Domestic animals have variations in coat color as well as texture, dwarf and giant varieties, and changes in their reproductive cycle, and many others have tooth crowding and floppy ears.\n\nAlthough it is easy to assume that each of these traits was uniquely selected for by hunter-gatherers and early farmers, beginning in 1959 Dmitry Belyayev tested the reactions of silver foxes to a hand placed in their cage and selected the tamest, least aggressive individuals to breed. His hypothesis was that, by selecting a behavioral trait, he could also influence the phenotype of subsequent generations, making them more domestic in appearance. Over the next 40 years, he succeeded in producing foxes with traits that were never directly selected for, including piebald coats, floppy ears, upturned tails, shortened snouts, and shifts in developmental timing. In the 1980s, a researcher used a set of behavioral, cognitive, and visible phenotypic markers, such as coat colour, to produce domesticated fallow deer within a few generations. Similar results for tameness and fear have been found for mink and Japanese quail. In addition to demonstrating that domestic phenotypic traits could arise through selection for a behavioral trait, and domestic behavioral traits could arise through the selection for a phenotypic trait, these experiments provided a mechanism to explain how the animal domestication process could have begun without deliberate human forethought and action.\n\nThe genetic difference between domestic and wild populations can be framed within two considerations. The first distinguishes between domestication traits that are presumed to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations. Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates and were selected during the initial episode of domestication, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations. A second issue is whether traits associated with the domestication syndrome resulted from a relaxation of selection as animals exited the wild environment or from positive selection resulting from intentional and unintentional human preference. Some recent genomic studies on the genetic basis of traits associated with the domestication syndrome have shed light on both of these issues.\n\nGeneticists have identified more than 300 genetic loci and 150 genes associated with coat color variability. Knowing the mutations associated with different colors has allowed some correlation between the timing of the appearance of variable coat colors in horses with the timing of their domestication. Other studies have shown how human-induced selection is responsible for the allelic variation in pigs. Together, these insights suggest that, although natural selection has kept variation to a minimum before domestication, humans have actively selected for novel coat colors as soon as they appeared in managed populations.\n\nIn 2015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication. The process of domestication was assumed to have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals and relied on reproductive isolation between wild and domestic forms, but the study found that the assumption of reproductive isolation with population bottlenecks was not supported. The study indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in Western Asia and China, with Western Asian pigs introduced into Europe where they crossed with wild boar. A model that fitted the data included admixture with a now extinct ghost population of wild pigs during the Pleistocene. The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at genetic loci that affect behavior and morphology. The study concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created domestication islands in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.\n\nUnlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors. In 2016, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response (i.e. selection for tameness), and emotional processing. Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared to wolves. Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation.\n\n"}

He is usually referred to as Ricardo Wall.\n\nWall belonged to a family settled in Kilmallock, one of whom was Bishop of Limerick. Richard \"Ricardo\" Wall y Devereux was born at Nantes to a family of Irish Jacobite refugees, supporters the Catholic James II, King of England. He was baptized two days after his birth at the in unfavourable circumstances: his father, Matthew \"Matías\" Wall of Killmallock, Co. Limerick, a long-serving officer in King James II's cavalry, was absent. His family then lived in the \"pit of the well of the silver\" supported by a relative, probably Gilbert Wall, the clockmaker.\n\nNothing much is known about his early years. Around 1710, he was introduced as page to the Bavarian Princess Marie Anne de Bourbon, Duchess of Vendôme who was Duchess d'Étampes in her own right (her father was Henry III Jules de Bourbon, prince de Condé). In 1716, he left France and joined the Royal House of Spain following a letter of request from the Prime Minister, Cardinal Alberoni, signed by the 38-year-old Dowager Duchess of Vendôme, Marie-Anne de Borbón-Condé.\n\nWall entered the Colegio Real de Guardiamarinas, founded at Cadiz by José Patiño in 1717, graduating in the second year of its foundation. He was then commissioned in the Spanish Navy serving on \"Real San Felipe\" (74 guns), under the command of Admiral Gaztañeta, which participated in the campaign of Sicily (1718) until the defeat of the Spanish fleet at the Battle of Cape Passaro. Wall was then seconded to the Spanish Regiment of Hibernia, commanded by the Marquess of Lede taking part in land battles such as Milazzo and Francavilla. During the subsequent defence of Ceuta (1720–21), Wall was appointed the Marquis' \"Aide-de-Camp\" before being promoted captain in the Regiment of Batavia. \n\nIn 1727, Wall accompanied his compatriot James Fitz-James Stuart, 2nd Duke of Berwick (1696–1738) during his ambassadorial visit to the Tsar of Russia; the Scottish Duke was also Duke of Liria and Jérica, heir of the 1st Duke of Berwick, an illegitimate son of James II of England.\n\nWall was posted on other missions by the Duke of Líria y Jérica, such as to the King of Prussia, who decorated him as a Knight of the Red Eagle. While a Stuart ambassadorship to Berlin did not materialise, Wall took the opportunity to cultivate numerous contacts throughout Europe, in Parma, Vienna, Dresden as well as in Saint Petersburg and Moscow.\nHe returned to Spain in 1729. Between 1732 and 1734, he served in the expedition to Tuscany which placed Prince Carlos on the throne of Parma. Shortly after, he took part in the War of Naples (1734–35), seeing action at Capua, Messina and Syracuse. \n\nIn 1737 he was appointed a Knight of the Military Order of Santiago and in 1741, was created Encomienda of Peñausende, which in addition to Peñausende included Peralejos de Abajo, Saucelle, Saldeana and Barrueco Pardo (now in the provinces of Zamora and Salamanca). \n\nIn 1740 he was appointed Colonel of Dragoons, which while under his command displayed his livery colours and family motto : \"Aut Caesar aut nullus\".\n\nAppointed Captain-General in 1744, he participated in the Lombardy campaign in the War of the Austrian Succession, being deployed by Infante Felipe de Borbón \"in the boldest attacks\". Promoted Brigadier in 1747, he formed a useful friendship with one of the most influential courtiers of the era, the Duke of Huéscar (later Duke of Alba).\n\nWounded in action at Piacenza (1746), he transferred to diplomatic service and, in May 1747, was posted to Genoa on a temporary mission \"concerning solely military matters\"; soon after afterwards, he was posted to London by the new Spanish Minister of State, José de Carvajal, a friend of Huescar.\n\nWall's diplomatic mission to London was for negotiating peace between the Bourbons and Great Britain, but it soon ran into difficulties not least because of reservations in British ministerial quarters about his Irish and Jacobite roots, but also from infighting on the Spanish side by the Marquess of Tabuérniga \"later\" de La Ensenada who had coveted his position.\n\nThe Marqués de La Ensenada was recalled to Madrid, leaving General Wall to enjoy the trappings of ambassadorial residence at Soho Square. Wall is depicted in a portrait by Van Loo (now at the National Gallery, Dublín), and he sponsored the Arts in general, commissioning a \"Santiago\" by Tiépolo for his private chapel (now hanging at the Szépmüvészeti Múzeum in Budapest), as well as written works such as those by Smollett, including the translation of \"Don Quixote\" (1755) which is dedicated to him.\n\nIn 1754 Wall was recalled from London to Madrid becoming Minister of Foreign Affairs, after the death of José de Carvajal. A few months later he played a part in driving Carvajal's successor the Marquess de La Ensenada from office, thereby also helping Huescar and the British Ambassador, Sir Benjamin Keene. Wall served as Chief Minister until 1763, when the Duke of Grimaldi succeeded him.\n\nThe despatches of the British Minister, Sir Benjamin Keene, and those of his successor, George Hervey, 2nd Earl of Bristol, contain many references to General Wall. They are creditable to him. Though a constant partisan of peace and good relations with Britain, Wall was firm in asserting the rights of the government he served. During the early stages of the Seven Years' War (1756–63) he insisted on claiming compensation for the excesses of British privateers in Spanish waters. He frequently complained to British officials about the difficulties which these adventurers' violence was causing. As an expatriate, despite having previously represented the French Crown, he was often taunted by various French factions. \n\nWall himself was more concerned that Britain's colonial acquisitions from France could mean that Spain's South American Empire was threatened. The new King Charles III (1759–88) retained Wall as Prime Minister. When Spain declared War in 1761, Wall as Prime Minister naturally carried out his King's decree, although he later confessed to Lord Bristol, the British Ambassador, some regret with the benefit of hindsight that he could see the failure of his efforts in preserving the peace. The close relations between Charles III and the French Bourbon Kings later made General Wall’s position as Prime Minister very trying. Yet King Charles, who detested changing his ministers, refused all Wall's requests to retire, till Wall exhorted himself in 1763 by elaborately affecting an imaginary eye disease.\n\nThroughout his Spanish government service Wall built a network of relationships which survived his tenure for several decades perhaps even helping Spain during the following reign of King Charles IV. Among the relationships he developed were those with: the Duke of Grimaldi, the Count of Aranda, the Count of Campomanes, Manuel de Roda, Cayetano Pignatelli, Marquess of Rubí as well as with various ambassadors from around Europe such as the , and also with commissioners from the colonies, like Ambrosio de Funes Villalpando, Count of Ricla. \n\nAmong his committed Irish supporters were the engineer William Bowles (1720–84) who studied the geology of Spain, Pedro Fitz-James Stuart, the de Lacy family, Alejandro O'Reilly, Arnold \"later\" Lord Mahoney, Carlos McCarthy, Francis Nangle, Ambrosio O'Higgins and Bernard Ward.\n\nWall extended friendship and knowledge with others such as Francisco Pérez Bayer, Jose Clavijo y Fajardo, , Celestino Mutis, (Spanish Ambassador to Vienna under Emperor Joseph II & nephew of one of Spain's First Secretaries of State), Sebastián de la Cuadra, 1st Marquis of Villarías, numerous members of Juan de Iriarte's family, Bernardino del Campo, Ambassador José Nicolás de Azara (a follower of William Bowles' work) and Juan de Chindulza.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1753. \n\nThe King of Spain gave General Wall y Devereux a handsome reward for his service.\nWall received a grant for life of crown land known as the , near Granada, later conferred upon Manuel Godoy, before being awarded to the Duke of Wellington.\n\nGeneral Wall spent the rest of his life, until 1777, between homes in and near Granada, welcoming all visitors and particularly English travelers exploring Spain's culture. He left a reputation as being a very able minister as well as a most witty conversationalist.\n\nHe died on 26 December 1777, imparting a few words to his friend and confessor, Juan Miguel Kayser. A subsequent lawsuit between his natural heirs – namely, his cousin Eduardo Wall and family – and those of his confessor, somewhat clouded his memory for a while.\n\nGeneral Wall y Devereux did not marry and left no children. His closest relative, Eduardo Wall, married , whose remaining descendants include the Condes and .\n\nNB: some clarifications on General Wall's life: contrary to Coxe's writings he was never sent on a mission to Spanish America nor did he lay plans for retaking Jamaica from the British. Coxe confuses one John Savy, nicknamed Miguel Wall, with Richard Wall, nor was Wall ever Ambassador to The Netherlands.\n\n\n"}

It was originally released as a 2 LP set on Capitol (SWBB-223).\n\nAfter producing a string of albums and #1 chart hits, Haggard decided to record a tribute album to Jimmie Rodgers, who, along with Lefty Frizzell and Bob Wills, was one of his favorite artists. Haggard had already recorded a couple of Rodgers songs, having included the Blue Yodeler's \"Rough and Rowdy Ways\" on his 1967 LP \"I'm a Lonesome Fugitive\" while the same version of \"California Blues\" on this album had been featured on \"Pride in What I Am\" three months earlier. \"Same Train, A Different Time\" includes several spoken word introductions by Haggard where he talks about the life and songs of the legendary country singer.\n\nIn 1990 it became the first of Merle Haggard's Capitol albums to be re-released on CD when it was reissued by EMI-Toshiba in Japan in its entire original repertoire.\n\nThe album was released May 1, 1969 and topped the \"Billboard\" country albums chart without the benefit of a hit single.

There are contemporary folk, country and blues influences scattered throughout the record, adding depth to the music and proving that Rodgers' music is indeed timeless.\"\n\nAll tracks written by Jimmie Rodgers unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n\nThe Strangers:\n\nwith\n\nand\n"}

Written by Fintan Coyle, co-creator of hit game show \"Weakest Link\", it was first broadcast on the BBC on 11 November 2002 and ran over six episodes until 16 December. There were some very mixed opinions on the show among both critics and viewers, but it achieved decent ratings and featured an excellent comedy cast including Richard Griffiths, Alexander Armstrong and \"The League of Gentlemen's\" Reece Shearsmith. The series was released on DVD in the UK on 29 October 2007.\n\nThe show never confirms what \"TLC\" stands for, although it is presumed to be a sarcastic reference to the widely used abbreviation for \"Tender Loving Care\", but could equally refer to the alternative yet related abbreviation \"Total Lack of Concern\".\n\nDr Laurence Flynn (Played by Reece Shearsmith): A very unfortunate young Surgical House Officer who's only just started his job at the hospital. He's still haunted by the fact that he failed his final medical exams first time round (something his co-workers will never let him forget) and is determined to redeem himself. He is neurotic, clumsy, lacking in self-confidence and generally just not cut out for his job, and, unfortunately for him, is not at all popular among the other staff at the hospital despite his best efforts to befriend them. As a result, the staff play a lot of very cruel and often sadistic practical jokes on him, (such as fooling him into trying to revive a dead patient, getting him sectioned under the mental health act, and giving him jabs for no reason at all) and poor Dr Flynn ends up teetering on the edge of sanity for most of the series. He often suffers from lack of sleep and ends up seeing and doing some very strange things as a result. He is madly in love with nurse Judy.\n\nDr Stephen Noble (Played by Alexander Armstrong): A Surgical Registrar at the hospital and Dr Laurence's mentor. He is Flynn's only friend and the two seem quite close, but he actually enjoys playing jokes on Flynn just as much as everyone else does, and even sets up a few himself. Dr Noble enjoys being a doctor, but he is endlessly cynical by nature. He sometimes gets blamed for screw-ups during surgery but manages to shift the blame onto the hapless Dr Flynn. He too suffers from lack of sleep and is addicted to coffee.\n\nNurse Judy Conway (Played by Georgia Mackenzie): An attractive Staff Nurse who stands guard over the precious coffee with her fellow nurses. She is very cool and level-headed, and can seem quite caring towards others, but she has a malicious side with a cruel sense of humour. She is fully aware of Dr Flynn's crush on her and often uses it to take advantage of him—delighting in making him the object of ridicule in front of others.\n\nNurse Terry Cheung (Played by Benedict Wong): An openly gay Theatre Nurse who rooms with Nurse Judy. Although Nurse Terry doesn't instigate any of the practical jokes on Dr Flynn, he is almost always a willing participant.\n\nGasman (Played by Erich Redman): A creepy German anaesthetist who works in the surgical ward of the hospital. He has a quite a pain fetish and is genuinely obsessed with the idea of making others suffer as much as possible, meaning he is not particularly good at his job. His only real goal in life is to torture both his patients and his co-workers whenever he can.\n\nMr Benedict Ron (Played by Richard Griffiths): The hospital's director of surgery. He is a good-natured guy who's always kind to his patients but is an embarrassingly bad surgeon. He always gets away with his failed operations anyway, usually by blaming someone else.\n\nSister Charity Hope (Played by Llewella Gideon): The Ward Sister who is pretty much the only completely sane person in the hospital. She is a mother to all, likes to keep things under control, and wears gallstones as earrings.\n\nSid (Played by Tom Watt): The hospital porter, who is deadly slow at everything he does. He is not very good at what he does but is quite a good-natured guy, and has a secret crush on Sister Charity Hope.\n\nWheelchair Guy (Played by Martin Trenaman): An unlucky man who seems to permanently reside in the hospital. His legs don't normally work but he is almost cured every episode... Unluckily for him something also happens that stops the healing process each episode. The nurses don't seem too bothered by his plight. He eventually heals and leaves the hospital, but has an accident on a miniscooter soon afterwards.\n\nTim Brooke-Taylor also had a role as a surgeon who had a nervous breakdown and was only allowed back in the hospital as the Hospital Chaplain and who now constantly wants to try to operate on patients and is puzzled as to why God allows suffering.\n\nThe series was released on DVD in 2007. Aspect ratio is 16:9 and region is 2. There are no extra features.\n\n"}

The path is well marked and guide books are available. There are two main branches in the way. One starts at Fowey, runs west to Tywardreath, then north through St Blazey, and Luxulyan. The other runs north from Fowey to Golant and Lanlivery. The branches meet close to Helman Tor. The pilgrimage is mainly for religion.\n\nThe Saints' Way follows the probable route of early Christian travellers making their way from Ireland to the Continent. Rather than risk the difficult passage around Land's End they would disembark their ships on the North Cornish coast and progress to ports such as Fowey on foot. \n\nBetween 55 - 50AD a Roman trading centre was constructed at Nanstallon (near Bodmin) and it is thought its purpose was to serve the main communication and trade route linking the north Cornish coast at the River Camel and the southern coast at the River Fowey, the 'transpeninsular route'. However the centre was abandoned after only 20-25 years and it was never used again. It is thought that the trading route served the Celtic peoples of Ireland, Wales, Cornwall and Brittany as Nanstallon was built close to major mineral bearing areas.\n\nThe establishment of the way followed the discovery of a section of abandoned pathway surfaced with cobbles and featuring a series of granite stiles near the village of Luxulyan by two villagers in 1984. The way was created as part of the Cooperative Retail Services Community Programme and opened in 1986.\n\n"}

The 2010 population estimate is 2,924 and the district council has classified it as able to expand further.\n\nFollowing boundary changes, Bugbrooke remains part of the Parliamentary Constituency of Daventry. It is considered a \"safe\" Conservative seat. At the 2015 and 2017 general elections, the Daventry seat was retained by the Conservative candidate, Chris Heaton-Harris.\n\nBugbrooke is in South Northamptonshire Council's two-member \"Heyfords and Bugbrooke\" ward, covering the village as well as neighbouring Nether Heyford and Upper Heyford.\n\nFrom May 2013, the Northamptonshire County Council seat of Bugbrooke joined with 10 other parish councils to form Bugbrooke division.\n\nBugbrooke Parish Council meets monthly and is re-elected every four years.\n\nBugbrooke has an Anglican church, dedicated to St Michael and All Angels which dates from the 13th century. There are monuments to the Whitfield family from 1704 and 1734. There is an early 19th-century rectory west of the church.\n\nThe Baptist chapel is dated 1808. A row of yellow-brick cottages east of the chapel past the brook were built in 1844 in the Gothic style by Edmund Francis Law and were originally a National School with accommodation for the master.\n\nThere is a manor house at the north-east end of the village with a wide-arched entrance to the yard. This was restored in the Tudor style by Edmund Francis Law in 1881.\n\nThe village has three pubs: \"The Bakers Arms\" in the High Street; \"The Wharf\" alongside the Grand Union Canal and \"The Five Bells\" opposite the church. There is also a GP.\n\nBugbrooke Community Primary School is in the High Street, and a large comprehensive school, Campion School, serving Bugbrooke and several nearby villages, is situated on Kislingbury Road on the eastern approach to the village. It was built in 1966-68 with extension in 1972-72 and was the first purpose-built comprehensive in the county.\n\nA village magazine, \"Bugbrooke Link\", is published monthly, and includes regular reporting of Church, Parish Council and sports events.\n\nRugby club Bugbrooke Badgers\n\nBugbrooke has a Non-League football team Bugbrooke St Michaels F.C. who play at Birds Close.\n\nBugbrooke also has a thriving Rugby Club who currently play in Midlands Division One. http://pitchero.com/clubs/bugbrooke\n\nThere is a large, modern community centre at Camp Close on the southern edge of the village. Adjacent to this is a large sports field. Sports groups include well-supported Bowls and Cricket clubs.\n\nThe village, named in the Domesday Book of 1086 AD as \"Buchebroc\", is situated on the Hoarestone Brook, which flows through the village from south to north. The name of the stream is supposed to be a corruption of Horse-stone, as an old packhorse route crossed the brook by a simple slab bridge just outside the village. When the stream was widened in the 1970s, the last of the mediaeval slabs was damaged beyond repair, but the pillars are still intact.\n\nThe brook meets the River Nene near Bugbrooke Mill. The first mill on the site was established in 800 AD and by the time of the Domesday Book was the third-highest rated mill in England. It is now the site of Heygate's flour mill, whose large central tower can be seen for several miles around. Heygate's trucks, with their distinctive maroon markings, can frequently be seen rumbling along Bugbrooke's main road.\n\nThe West Coast Main Line railway and the Grand Union Canal run adjacent to the south-west of the parish, with the A5 major road a little further, while the M1 motorway runs to the north-east.\n\nBugbrooke is also the birthplace of the Jesus Army, which sprang out of the Baptist Chapel in the centre of the village, which it continues to use regularly.\n\nNorthampton's Express Lift Tower can be seen from the village about to the east.\n\n"}

Haggard gathered up six of the remaining members of The Texas Playboys to record the tribute: Johnnie Lee Wills, Eldon Shamblin, Tiny Moore, Joe Holley, Johnny Gimble, and Alex Brashear. Merle's band The Strangers were also present during the recording but unfortunately Wills suffered a massive stroke after the first day of recording. Merle arrived on the second day, devastated that he wouldn't get to record with him.\nHaggard spent a few scant months learning the fiddle, an instrument that he had not touched since his childhood violin lessons. Unlike Haggard's previous tribute album to Jimmie Rodgers, which gave the original songs a new sound, his Wills LP remained true to the original arrangements. As Cantwell observes, \"The album's most charming quality, its attention to authentic period detail, is a built-in limitation it never entirely transcends.\" Completely apolitical, the album reached number 2 on the \"Billboard\" Country Albums Chart and peaked at number 58 on the Pop Album Chart, his highest showing there to date. The album would play a crucial role in the revitalization of Western Swing music and inspire younger musicians like Asleep at the Wheel and Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen.\nHaggard would do more tribute albums to Wills over the next 40 years. In 1973 he appeared on \"For The Last Time Bob Wills And His Texas Playboys\". In 1994 Haggard collaborated with Asleep at the Wheel and many other artists influenced by the music of Bob Wills on an album entitled \"Tribute To The Music Of Bob Wills And The Texas Playboys\". \"A Tribute\" was re-released on CD on the Koch label in 1995 with both the original Haggard liner notes and new notes by country music and western swing historian Rich Kienzle, who described the album's influence on his interest in delving deeper into Wills and his legacy.\n\nAllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album \"a ragged, enthusiastic good time. Haggard, the Strangers, and the Playboys play their hearts out, breathing life into Wills warhorses... while bringing attention to lesser-known songs... The fact that Western swing re-established itself as a viable country genre after the release of \"A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player\" is a testament to the power and charm of this record.\" Music critic Robert Christgau wrote \"Now that's the Merle I trust. His uncountrypolitan formal sense has always gone along with a reverence for history, and his subtle, surprisingly tranquil, yet passionate singing style - all that yodel and straining head voice—was made for Wills's pop-jazz-country amalgam.\"\n\n\n\nThe Strangers:\n\nwith\n\nand\n\n"}

{"id": "2118843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118843", "title": "Progress", "text": "Progress\n\nProgress is the movement towards a refined, improved, or otherwise desired state. In the context of progressivism, it refers to the proposition that advancements in technology, science, and social organization have resulted, and by extension will continue to result, in an improved human condition; the latter may happen as a result of direct human action, as in social enterprise or through activism, or as a natural part of sociocultural evolution.\n\nThe concept of progress was introduced in the early 19th-century social theories, especially social evolution as described by Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. It was present in the Enlightenment's philosophies of history. As a goal, social progress has been advocated by varying realms of political ideologies with different theories on how it is to be achieved.\n\nSpecific indicators for measuring progress can range from economic data, technical innovations, change in the political or legal system, and questions bearing on individual life chances, such as life expectancy and risk of disease and disability.\n\nGDP growth has become a key orientation for politics and is often taken as a key figure to evaluate a politician's performance. However, GDP has a number of flaws that make it a bad measure of progress, especially for developed countries. For example, environmental damage is not taken into account nor is the sustainability of economic activity. Wikiprogress has been set up to share information on evaluating societal progress. It aims to facilitate the exchange of ideas, initiatives and knowledge. HumanProgress.org is another online resource that seeks to compile data on different measures of societal progress.\n\nOur World in Data is a scientific online publication, based at the University of Oxford, that studies how to make progress against large global problems such as poverty, disease, hunger, climate change, war, existential risks, and inequality.\nThe mission of Our World in Data is to present \"research and data to make progress against the world’s largest problems\".\nThe Social Progress Index is a tool developed by the International Organization Imperative Social Progress, which measures the extent to which countries cover social and environmental needs of its citizenry. There are fifty-two indicators in three areas or dimensions: Basic Human Needs, and Foundations of Wellbeing and Opportunities which show the relative performance of nations.\n\nIndices that can be used to measure progress include:\n\nScientific progress is the idea that the scientific community learns more over time, which causes a body of scientific knowledge to accumulate. The chemists in the 19th century knew less about chemistry than the chemists in the 20th century, and they in turn knew less than the chemists in the 21st century. Looking forward, today's chemists reasonably expect that chemists in future centuries will know more than they do. \n\nThis process differs from non-science fields, such as human languages or history: the people who spoke a now-extinct language, or who lived through a historical time period, can be said to have known different things from the scholars who studied it later, but they cannot be said to know less about their lives than the modern scholars. Some valid knowledge is lost through the passage of time, and other knowledge is gained, with the result that the non-science fields do not make scientific progress towards understanding their subject areas.\n\nFrom the 18th century through late 20th century, the history of science, especially of the physical and biological sciences, was often presented as a progressive accumulation of knowledge, in which true theories replaced false beliefs. Some more recent historical interpretations, such as those of Thomas Kuhn, tend to portray the history of science in terms of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix of intellectual, cultural, economic and political trends. These interpretations, however, have met with opposition for they also portray the history of science as an incoherent system of incommensurable paradigms, not leading to any scientific progress, but only to the illusion of progress.\n\nAspects of social progress, as described by Condorcet, have included the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of inequalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty. The social progress of a society can be measured based on factors such as its ability to address fundamental human needs, help citizens improve their quality of life, and provide opportunities for citizens to succeed.\n\nSocial progress is often improved by increases in GDP, although other factors are also relevant. An imbalance between economic and social progress hinders further economic progress, and can lead to political instability.\n\nHow progress improved the status of women in traditional society was a major theme of historians starting in the Enlightenment and continuing to today. British theorists William Robertson (1721–1793) and Edmund Burke (1729–1797), along with many of their contemporaries, remained committed to Christian- and republican-based conceptions of virtue, while working within a new Enlightenment paradigm. The political agenda related beauty, taste, and morality to the imperatives and needs of modern societies of a high level of sophistication and differentiation. Two themes in the work of Robertson and Burke—the nature of women in 'savage' and 'civilized' societies and 'beauty in distress'—reveals how long-held convictions about the character of women, especially with regard to their capacity and right to appear in the public domain, were modified and adjusted to the idea of progress and became central to modern European civilization.\n\nClassics experts have examined the status of women in the ancient world, concluding that in the Roman Empire, with its superior social organization, internal peace, and rule of law, allowed women to enjoy a somewhat better standing than in ancient Greece, where women were distinctly inferior. The inferior status of women in traditional China has raised the issue of whether the idea of progress requires a thoroughgoing reject of traditionalism—a belief held by many Chinese reformers in the early 20th century.\n\nHistorians Leo Marx and Bruce Mazlish asking, \"Should we in fact abandon the idea of progress as a view of the past,\" answer that there is no doubt \"that the status of women has improved markedly\" in cultures that have adopted the Enlightenment idea of progress.\n\nModernization was promoted by classical liberals in the 19th and 20th centuries, who called for the rapid modernization of the economy and society to remove the traditional hindrances to free markets and free movements of people. During the Enlightenment in Europe social commentators and philosophers began to realize that people \"themselves\" could change society and change their way of life. Instead of being made completely by gods, there was increasing room for the idea that people themselves \"made their own society\"—and not only that, as Giambattista Vico argued, \"because\" people made their own society, they could also fully comprehend it. This gave rise to new sciences, or proto-sciences, which claimed to provide new scientific knowledge about what society was like, and how one may change it for the better.\n\nIn turn, this gave rise to progressive opinion, in contrast with conservational opinion. The social conservationists were skeptical about panaceas for social ills. According to conservatives, attempts to radically remake society normally make things worse. Edmund Burke was the leading exponent of this, although later-day liberals like Hayek have espoused similar views. They argue that society changes organically and naturally, and that grand plans for the remaking of society, like the French Revolution, National Socialism and Communism hurt society by removing the traditional constraints on the exercise of power.\n\nThe scientific advances of the 16th and 17th centuries provided a basis for Francis Bacon's book the New Atlantis. In the 17th century, Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle described progress with respect to arts and the sciences, saying that each age has the advantage of not having to rediscover what was accomplished in preceding ages. The epistemology of John Locke provided further support and was popularized by the Encyclopedists Diderot, Holbach, and Condorcet. Locke had a powerful influence on the American Founding Fathers. The first complete statement of progress is that of Turgot, in his \"A Philosophical Review of the Successive Advances of the Human Mind\" (1750). For Turgot, progress covers not only the arts and sciences but, on their base, the whole of culture—manner, mores, institutions, legal codes, economy, and society. Condorcet predicted the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of inequalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill's (1806–1873) ethical and political thought demonstrated faith in the power of ideas and of intellectual education for improving human nature or behavior. For those who do not share this faith the idea of progress becomes questionable.\n\nAlfred Marshall (1842–1924), a British economist of the early 20th century, was a proponent of classical liberalism. In his highly influential \"Principles of Economics\" (1890), he was deeply interested in human progress and in what is now called \"sustainable development.\" For Marshall, the importance of wealth lay in its ability to promote the physical, mental, and moral health of the general population. After World War II, the modernization and development programs undertaken in the Third World were typically based on the idea of progress.\n\nIn Russia the notion of progress was first imported from the West by Peter the Great (1672–1725). An absolute ruler, he used the concept to modernize Russia and to legitimize his monarchy (unlike its usage in Western Europe, where it was primarily associated with political opposition). By the early 19th century, the notion of progress was being taken up by Russian intellectuals and was no longer accepted as legitimate by the tsars. Four schools of thought on progress emerged in 19th-century Russia: conservative (reactionary), religious, liberal, and socialist—the latter winning out in the form of Bolshevist materialism.\n\nThe intellectual leaders of the American Revolution, such as Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, were immersed in Enlightenment thought and believed the idea of progress meant that they could reorganize the political system to the benefit of the human condition; both for Americans and also, as Jefferson put it, for an \"Empire of Liberty\" that would benefit all mankind. In particular, Adams wrote “I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain.”\n\nJuan Bautista Alberdi (1810–1884) was one of the most influential political theorists in Argentina. Economic liberalism was the key to his idea of progress. He promoted faith in progress, while chiding fellow Latin Americans for blind copying of American and European models. He hoped for progress through promotion of immigration, education, and a moderate type of federalism and republicanism that might serve as a transition in Argentina to true democracy.\n\nIn Mexico, José María Luis Mora (1794–1850) was a leader of classical liberalism in the first generation after independence, leading the battle against the conservative trinity of the army, the church, and the \"hacendados\". He envisioned progress as both a process of human development by the search for philosophical truth and as the introduction of an era of material prosperity by technological advancement. His plan for Mexican reform demanded a republican government bolstered by widespread popular education free of clerical control, confiscation and sale of ecclesiastical lands as a means of redistributing income and clearing government debts, and effective control of a reduced military force by the government. Mora also demanded the establishment of legal equality between native Mexicans and foreign residents. His program, untried in his lifetime, became the key element in the Mexican Constitution of 1857.\n\nIn Italy, the idea that progress in science and technology would lead to solutions for human ills was connected to the nationalism that united the country in 1860. The Piedmontese Prime Minister Camillo Cavour envisaged the railways as a major factor in the modernization and unification of the Italian peninsula. The new Kingdom of Italy, formed in 1861, worked to speed up the processes of modernization and industrialization that had begun in the north, but were slow to arrive in the Papal States and central Italy, and were nowhere in sight in the \"Mezzogiorno\" (that is, Southern Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia). The government sought to combat the backwardness of the poorer regions in the south and work towards augmenting the size and quality of the newly created Italian army so that it could compete on an equal footing with the powerful nations of Europe. In the same period, the government was legislating in favour of public education to fight the great problem of illiteracy, upgrade the teaching classes, improve existing schools, and procure the funds needed for social hygiene and care of the body as factors in the physical and moral regeneration of the race.\n\nIn China, in the 20th century the Kuomintang or Nationalist party, which ruled from the 1920s to the 1940s, advocated progress. The Communists under Mao Zedong adopted western models and their ruinous projects caused mass famines. After Mao's death, however, the new regime led by Deng Xiaoping (1904–1997) and his successors aggressively promoted modernization of the economy using capitalist models and imported western technology. This was termed the \"Opening of China\" in the west, and more broadly encompasses Chinese economic reform.\n\nAmong environmentalists, there is a continuum between two opposing poles. The one pole is optimistic, progressive, and business-oriented, and endorses the classic idea of progress. For example, bright green environmentalism endorses the idea that new designs, social innovations and green technologies can solve critical environmental challenges. The other is pessimistic in respect of technological solutions, warning of impending global crisis (through climate change or peak oil, for example) and tends to reject the very idea of modernity and the myth of progress that is so central to modernization thinking. Similarly, Kirkpatrick Sale, wrote about progress as a myth benefiting the few, and a pending environmental doomsday for everyone. An example is the philosophy of Deep Ecology.\n\nSociologist Robert Nisbet said that \"No single idea has been more important than ... the Idea of Progress in Western civilization for three thousand years\", and defines five \"crucial premises\" of the idea of progress:\n\nSociologist P. A. Sorokin said, \"The ancient Chinese, Babylonian, Hindu, Greek, Roman, and most of the medieval thinkers supporting theories of rhythmical, cyclical or trendless movements of social processes were much nearer to reality than the present proponents of the linear view\". Unlike Confucianism and to a certain extent Taoism, that both search for an ideal past, the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition believes in the fulfillment of history, which was translated into the idea of progress in the modern age. Therefore, Chinese proponents of modernization have looked to western models. According to Thompson, the late Qing dynasty reformer, Kang Youwei, believed he had found a model for reform and \"modernisation\" in the Ancient Chinese Classics.\n\nPhilosopher Karl Popper said that progress was not fully adequate as a scientific explanation of social phenomena.\nMore recently, Kirkpatrick Sale, a self-proclaimed neo-luddite author, wrote exclusively about progress as a myth, in an essay entitled \"Five Facets of a Myth\".\n\nIggers (1965) says that proponents of progress underestimated the extent of man's destructiveness and irrationality, while critics misunderstand the role of rationality and morality in human behavior.\n\nIn 1946, psychoanalyst Charles Baudouin claimed modernity has retained the \"corollary\" of the progress myth, the idea that the present is superior to the past, while at the same time insisting that it is free of the myth:\nA cyclical theory of history was adopted by Oswald Spengler (1880–1936), a German historian who wrote \"The Decline of the West\" in 1920. World War I, World War II, and the rise of totalitarianism demonstrated that progress was not automatic and that technological improvement did not necessarily guarantee democracy and moral advancement. British historian Arnold J. Toynbee (1889–1975) felt that Christianity would help modern civilization overcome its challenges.\n\nThe Jeffersonians said that history is not exhausted but that man may begin again in a new world. Besides rejecting the lessons of the past, they Americanized the idea of progress by democratizing and vulgarizing it to include the welfare of the common man as a form of republicanism. As Romantics deeply concerned with the past, collecting source materials and founding historical societies, the Founding Fathers were animated by clear principles. They saw man in control of his destiny, saw virtue as a distinguishing characteristic of a republic, and were concerned with happiness, progress, and prosperity. Thomas Paine, combining the spirit of rationalism and romanticism, pictured a time when America's innocence would sound like a romance, and concluded that the fall of America could mark the end of 'the noblest work of human wisdom.'\n\nHistorian J. B. Bury wrote in 1920:\n\nIn the postmodernist thought steadily gaining ground from the 1980s, the grandiose claims of the modernizers are steadily eroded, and the very concept of social progress is again questioned and scrutinized. In the new vision, radical modernizers like Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong appear as totalitarian despots, whose vision of social progress is held to be totally deformed. Postmodernists question the validity of 19th-century and 20th-century notions of progress—both on the capitalist and the Marxist side of the spectrum. They argue that both capitalism and Marxism over-emphasize technological achievements and material prosperity while ignoring the value of inner happiness and peace of mind. Postmodernism posits that both dystopia and utopia are one and the same, overarching grand narratives with impossible conclusions.\nSome 20th-century authors refer to the \"Myth of Progress\" to refer to the idea that the human condition will inevitably improve. In 1932, English physician Montague David Eder wrote: \"The myth of progress states that civilization has moved, is moving, and will move in a desirable direction. Progress is inevitable... Philosophers, men of science and politicians have accepted the idea of the inevitability of progress.\" Eder argues that the advancement of civilization is leading to greater unhappiness and loss of control in the environment. The strongest critics of the idea of progress complain that it remains a dominant idea in the 21st century, and shows no sign of diminished influence. As one fierce critic, British historian John Gray (b. 1948), concludes:\nRecently the idea of progress has been generalized to psychology, being related with the concept of a goal, that is, progress is understood as \"what counts as a means of advancing towards the end result of a given defined goal.\"\n\nHistorian J. B. Bury said that thought in ancient Greece was dominated by the theory of world-cycles or the doctrine of eternal return, and was steeped in a belief parallel to the Judaic \"fall of man,\" but rather from a preceding \"Golden Age\" of innocence and simplicity. Time was generally regarded as the enemy of humanity which depreciates the value of the world. He credits the Epicureans with having had a potential for leading to the foundation of a theory of progress through their materialistic acceptance of the atomism of Democritus as the explanation for a world without an intervening deity.\nRobert Nisbet and Gertrude Himmelfarb have attributed a notion of progress to other Greeks. Xenophanes said \"The gods did not reveal to men all things in the beginning, but men through their own search find in the course of time that which is better.\" Plato's Book III of \"The Laws\" depicts humanity's progress from a state of nature to the higher levels of culture, economy, and polity. Plato's \"The Statesman\" also outlines a historical account of the progress of mankind.\n\nDuring the Medieval period, science was to a large extent based on Scholastic (a method of thinking and learning from the Middle Ages) interpretations of Aristotle's work. The Renaissance of the 15th, 16th and 17th Centuries changed the mindset in Europe towards an empirical view, based on a pantheistic interpretation of Plato. This induced a revolution in curiosity about nature in general and scientific advance, which opened the gates for technical and economic advance. Furthermore, the individual potential was seen as a never-ending quest for being God-like, paving the way for a view of Man based on unlimited perfection and progress.\n\nIn the Enlightenment, French historian and philosopher Voltaire (1694–1778) was a major proponent of progress. At first Voltaire's thought was informed by the idea of progress coupled with rationalism. His subsequent notion of the historical idea of progress saw science and reason as the driving forces behind societal advancement.\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724–1804) argued that progress is neither automatic nor continuous and does not measure knowledge or wealth, but is a painful and largely inadvertent passage from barbarism through civilization toward enlightened culture and the abolition of war. Kant called for education, with the education of humankind seen as a slow process whereby world history propels mankind toward peace through war, international commerce, and enlightened self-interest.\n\nScottish theorist Adam Ferguson (1723–1816) defined human progress as the working out of a divine plan, though he rejected predestination. The difficulties and dangers of life provided the necessary stimuli for human development, while the uniquely human ability to evaluate led to ambition and the conscious striving for excellence. But he never adequately analyzed the competitive and aggressive consequences stemming from his emphasis on ambition even though he envisioned man's lot as a perpetual striving with no earthly culmination. Man found his happiness only in effort.\n\nSome scholars consider the idea of progress that was affirmed with the Enlightenment, as a secularization of ideas from early Christianity, and a reworking of ideas from ancient Greece.\n\nIn the 19th century, Romantic critics charged that progress did not automatically better the human condition, and in some ways could make it worse. Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) reacted against the concept of progress as set forth by William Godwin and Condorcet because he believed that inequality of conditions is \"the best (state) calculated to develop the energies and faculties of man\". He said, \"Had population and food increased in the same ratio, it is probable that man might never have emerged from the savage state\". He argued that man's capacity for improvement has been demonstrated by the growth of his intellect, a form of progress which offsets the distresses engendered by the law of population.\n\nGerman philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) criticized the idea of progress as the 'weakling's doctrines of optimism,' and advocated undermining concepts such as faith in progress, to allow the strong individual to stand above the plebeian masses. An important part of his thinking consists of the attempt to use the classical model of 'eternal recurrence of the same' to dislodge the idea of progress.\n\nIggers (1965) argues there was general agreement in the late 19th century that the steady accumulation of knowledge and the progressive replacement of conjectural, that is, theological or metaphysical, notions by scientific ones was what created progress. Most scholars concluded this growth of scientific knowledge and methods led to the growth of industry and the transformation of warlike societies into industrial and pacific ones. They agreed as well that there had been a systematic decline of coercion in government, and an increasing role of liberty and of rule by consent. There was more emphasis on impersonal social and historical forces; progress was increasingly seen as the result of an inner logic of society.\n\nMarx developed a theory of historical materialism. He describes the mid-19th-century condition in \"The Communist Manifesto\" as follows:\n\nFurthermore, Marx described the process of social progress, which in his opinion is based on the interaction between the productive forces and the relations of production:\n\nCapitalism is thought by Marx as a process of continual change, in which the growth of markets dissolve all fixities in human life, and Marx admits that capitalism is progressive and non-reactionary. Marxism further states that capitalism, in its quest for higher profits and new markets, will inevitably sow the seeds of its own destruction. Marxists believe that, in the future, capitalism will be replaced by socialism and eventually communism.\n\nMany advocates of capitalism such as Schumpeter agreed with Marx's analysis of capitalism as a process of continual change through creative destruction, but, unlike Marx, believed and hoped that capitalism could essentially go on forever.\n\nThus, by the beginning of the 20th century, two opposing schools of thought—Marxism and liberalism—believed in the possibility and the desirability of continual change and improvement. Marxists strongly opposed capitalism and the liberals strongly supported it, but the one concept they could both agree on was progress, which affirms the power of human beings to make, improve and reshape their society, with the aid of scientific knowledge, technology and practical experimentation. \"Modernity\" denotes cultures that embrace that concept of progress. (This is not the same as modernism, which was the artistic and philosophical response to modernity, some of which embraced technology while rejecting individualism, but more of which rejected modernity entirely.)\n\n"}
{"id": "2118853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118853", "title": "Great Wyrley", "text": "Great Wyrley\n\nGreat Wyrley is a large village, civil parish and conjoined part of Landywood and Cheslyn Hay. In South Staffordshire, England, forming part of the Staffordshire border with the metropolitan borough of Walsall, West Midlands. It had a population of 11,060 at the 2011 census.\n\nThe word \"Wyrley\" derives from two Old English words: \"wir\" and \"leah\". \"Wir\" meant \"bog myrtle\" and \"leah\" meant \"woodland clearing\", suggesting that Great Wyrley began as sparse woodland or marshland. \"Great\" refers to its dominant size over Little Wyrley.\n\nAlternative Etymology, or \"How the Vikings are Responsible for Great Wyrley\":\n\nIt was 811 AD when Normans, or \"men from the north\" (AKA Vikings), appeared in the Seine Bay and gave their name to that part of Gaul (modern-day Normandy, France). Warleys were there from 811 to 1066, 255 years. William De Warlay (alt. Warley), about 1044 – about 1095, was born in Normandy, and participated in the Norman Conquest of 1066 under William the Conqueror, (his name is inscribed in the celebrated roll of Battle Abbey). William de Warley and his son Robert, commonly called Robert de Parva Wirley, had extensive grants of land in Staffordshire to which they gave the names Great and Little Wyrley, where William died. (His progeny would be known by De Warley, De Wirley, DeWirley, Worley, and even Wordly.) This designation of place based on his name would negate the theory of naming based on the physical attributes of place, since his name is Danish, and therefore any meaning drawn from the Old English should not be relied upon as a factual historical representation of the area.\n\nThis alternative etymology appears to be based on content from early versions of Burke's Landed Gentry, accuracy of which is suspect in many instances. In particular, more modern discussions of the history of Great Wyrley (example) do not mention Warley, and disagree with the above as to ownership/control of the land immediately following the Conquest. The etymology of the name as being based on Willam de Warlay is not established without further documentation of the arrival of Warley in this region.\n\nGreat Wyrley is mentioned in the Domesday Book under the name of \"Wereleia\", and as early as 1086 is said to have been indirectly owned by the Bishop of Chester St John's as part of the \"somewhat scattered holdings\" of the Church of Saint Chad in Lichfield. Some 480 acres of farming land were, assumingly, evenly distributed between Wyrley and nearby Norton Canes. However, all six dependencies of Saint Chad had been labelled as \"wasta\", which meant they had been abandoned by the time the Domesday Book was made.\n\nManorialism continued for a long period and the current holder of the rights to the feudal title of Great Wyrley Manor is, Anthony Henry Lord Great Wyrley, the freeholder of Great Wyrley and Essington Estates, Red Lane Essington, South Staffordshire, having acquired the title deeds from the Right Honourable Elizabeth Millicent Countess of Sutherland Duke of Sutherland in 1989. There is considerable documentation (dating from 1397) relating to this very large manor in terms of land currently in the safekeeping of Staffordshire libraries.\n\nIn former times the village was a mining village — The Great Wyrley Colliery — with metalworking (such as for nails, agricultural implements and horseshoes) in outlying areas. The Wyrley and Essington Canal passes nearby.\n\nIn 1848 Samuel Lewis included the settlement in his gazetteer and stated it had: \n\nIn 1876 Shapurji Edalji was appointed Vicar of Great Wyrley; he served until his death forty-two years later. A Parsi convert to Christianity from Bombay, he may well have been the first South Asian to become the incumbent of an English parish.\n\nIn 1903, the place was the scene of the \"Great Wyrley Outrages\", a series of slashings of horses, cows and sheep. In October, a local solicitor and son of the parson, George Edalji, was tried and convicted for the eighth attack, on a pit pony, and sentenced to seven years with hard labour. Edalji’s family had been the victims of a long-running campaign of untraceable abusive letters and anonymous harassment in 1888 and 1892-5. Further letters, in 1903, alleged he was partially responsible for the outrages and caused the police suspicion to focus on him.\n\nEdalji was released in 1906 after the Chief Justice in Bahamas and others had pleaded his case. But he was not pardoned, and the police kept him under surveillance. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle of Sherlock Holmes fame was persuaded to \"turn detective\" to prove the man's innocence. This he achieved after eight months of work. Edalji was exonerated by a Home Office committee of enquiry, although no compensation was awarded.\n\nLocal myth remembers the Outrages to have been enacted by \"The Wyrley Gang\", although Conan Doyle believed that they were the work of a single person, a local butcher's boy and sometime sailor called Royden Sharp. Ironically, Conan Doyle’s suspicion was based on circumstantial evidence. It was an over-reliance on this type of evidence in the first place which had resulted in Edalji’s flawed conviction.\n\nPoison pen letters in the name of the \"Wyrley Gang\" continued for another twenty-five years, but these were subsequently discovered to have been posted from outside the town by Enoch Knowles of Wednesbury, who was arrested and convicted in 1934.\n\nThis case has been related or retold:\n\n\nThere are two representatives on Staffordshire County Council, conservatives Kath Perry and Mike Lawrence whose physically large ward is called Cheslyn Hay, Essington and Great Wyrley. There are five representatives on South Staffordshire District Council:\n\nGreat Wyrley has been a safe Conservative seat since at least 1983. It is in the constituency of South Staffordshire and the current MP is Gavin Williamson first elected in 2010. He has increased his majority in every General Election since being first elected.\n\nGreat Wyrley can be divided into two South Staffordshire wards: \"Great Wyrley\" and \"Great Wyrley Landywood,\" the latter being home to the slightly more southern area of Landywood. However, the settlement of Little Wyrley lies within the parish of Norton Canes — a nearby village.\n\nGreat Wyrley lies just under two-and-a-half miles south of Cannock town centre, just under two miles east of Cheslyn Hay, and three-and-a-half miles north of Bloxwich town centre.\n\nGreat Wyrley has three primary schools and one high school:\n\nGreat Wyrley economically is largely a dormitory for commuters to Birmingham and Wolverhampton, and as a midpoint between Birmingham and Stafford, or Walsall and Cannock more locally; by the parish boundaries are junctions T7 on the M6 Toll motorway and 11 of the M6. \nLandywood railway station provides services south to Birmingham New Street and north to Rugeley Trent Valley. Wyrley and Cheslyn Hay railway station to the north of Landywood closed in the 1960s (see also: Beeching Report). \nGreat Wyrley is served by four bus routes running between Cannock, Walsall, Wolverhampton and Birmingham operated by Arriva Midlands, National Express WM and Select Bus:\n\nPrior to 2008, the area was largely covered by West Midlands Travel and Chase Bus. The area was adopted by Arriva under the 'Chase Linx' brand which has since become Sapphire. The 71 was adopted by Select following cut backs to Arriva services in 2018.\n\nRoute 2 is based on the old 351 service, and X51 from the 951 service over 10 years ago. This reduced to peak time only but in April 2019 a new timetable launched to run all day between Cannock and Birmingham via Great Wyrley.\n\n\nThe parish contains one listed building, Landywood Farmhouse, which is designated at Grade II, the lowest of the three grades, which is applied to \"buildings of national importance and special interest\". The farmhouse dates from the early 16th century and has a timber framed core on a sandstone plinth and a tile roof. It was altered and extended in the 19th century, the additions are in red brick and have been roughcast. There are two storeys and an attic, and a T-shaped plan, and the windows are casements with segmental heads.\n\n"}

It was first broadcast in 2000.\n\nThe series consists of seven 55-minute episodes, each dealing with a different decade, beginning with independence in 1921. The episodes do not, however, stick rigidly to their particular decade in order to avoid certain historical events from being split across two successive programmes (the Arms Crisis is an example of this). The final episode covers both the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\nSeveral important Irish figures gave interviews for the series.

He was the youngest son of Nizam Afzal-ud-Daulah. Afzal-ud-Daulah died on 28 February 1869. On 29 February, he ascended the throne under the regency of Dewan Salar Jung I and Shams-ul-Umra III. Mahboob Ali Khan was two years and seven months old at that time. While Salar Jung I served as regent, Shams-ul-Umra III served as co-regent.\n\nMahboob Ali Khan was the first Nizam to be exposed to western education. A special school under the guidance of Captain Claude Clerk was setup in the Chowmahalla Palace. The children of Salar Jung I, Shams-ul-Umra III and Kishen Pershad were his classmates. Besides English, he was also taught Persian, Arabic and Urdu languages. In 1874, Captain John Clerk, a former tutor to the Duke of Edinburgh was appointed to teach him English. Clarke imbibed in \" young Mahboob the customs and manners of high English society\"..\n\nAt the age of sixteen, Salar Jung I began introducing Mahboob Ali Khan into the administrative processes of the state. The highest ranking officials of various departments would meet him to teach him the working of their respective departments.

He opened his palace to accommodate the flood victims until \"normal conditions were restored\".\n\nThe Great Famine of 1876-1878 occurred during his reign. The entire Deccan, including Hyderabad Deccan, was devastated by food shortages which were enormously exacerbated by British policies. The Nizam distributed aid to famine victims, causing tens of thousands of people to flee to Hyderabad from Sholapur and other affected areas.\n\nThe practice of Sati \"where women used to jump into the burning pyre of their husbands\" concerned the Nizam. Taking serious note of Sati being continued in some parts of his kingdom despite the ban, he issued a Royal Firman on 12 November 1876 stating:\n\nThe 6th Nizam had seven sons and seven daughters.\n\nThe Nizam was well known for his extravagant lifestyle and collection of clothes and cars. His collection of clothes was one of the most extensive in the world at the time. He devoted a whole wing of his palace to his wardrobe and would never wear the same outfit twice. He bought the Jacob Diamond, which stands out among the Jewels of The Nizams now owned by the Government of India.\n\nThe Nizam was also fluent in Urdu, Telugu and Farsi languages. He also wrote poems in Telugu and Urdu, some of which are inscribed alongside the walls of Tank Bund. He was a keen hunter, killing at least 30 tigers.\n\nHe claimed to possess a healing power against snakebites. It was his order that if anyone from the public had a snake bite, they could approach him.\nAs a result, he was awakened from his sleep a number of times to cure people of snakebites.\n\nThe 6th Nizam died on 29 August 1911 at the age of 45. He was buried alongside his ancestors at Mecca Masjid, Hyderabad. His second son Mir Osman Ali Khan succeeded him; he was the last Nizam of Hyderabad.\n\n\nBritish honours\n\nForeign honours\n\n\n\n"}

The island was subsequently purchased by the British to use as a military garrison to help protect the traders. A treaty of cession was signed in 1823 and the island was formally named MacCarthy Island (after Sir Charles MacCarthy, former Governor General of the British West African Territories.) In 1832, Georgetown was founded by the British as a Creole settlement, though it was quickly populated by liberated Africans from elsewhere.

He is the U.S. Representative for and the first formerly undocumented immigrant to ever serve in Congress. Previously, he served as a member of the New York State Senate and as a member of the New York State Assembly.\n\nEspaillat was a ranking member of the New York Senate Housing, Construction and Community Development Committee and Chair of the Senate Latino Caucus. Espaillat represented the neighborhoods of Marble Hill, Inwood, Washington Heights, Hamilton Heights, Manhattanville, Morningside Heights, and the Upper West Side in Manhattan.\n\nEspaillat is a Democrat. On November 8, 2016, Espaillat was elected to the United States House of Representatives from New York's 13th congressional district to succeed retiring Charles Rangel. He is the first Dominican-American member of Congress.\n\nEspaillat was born on September 27, 1954 in Santiago, Dominican Republic to Melba (née Rodríguez) and Ulises Espaillat. Espaillat is a great-grandson of Dominican President Ulises Espaillat. Espaillat and his family moved to the United States in 1964. After overstaying a tourist visa, the Espaillats acquired Lawful Permanent Resident Cards also known as Green Cards in 1965.\n\nHe graduated from Bishop Dubois High School in 1974 and earned his B.S. degree in political science at Queens College in 1978. After growing up in Washington Heights, Espaillat currently lives in Inwood, Manhattan.\n\nEspaillat served as the Manhattan Court Services Coordinator for the New York City Criminal Justice Agency, a non-profit organization that provides indigent legal services and works to reduce unnecessary pretrial detention and post-sentence incarceration costs. As a state-certified conflict resolution mediator and volunteer with the Washington Heights Inwood Conflict Resolutions and Mediation Center, Espaillat helped resolve hundreds of conflicts.\n\nHe later worked as Director of the Washington Heights Victims Services Community Office, an organization offering counseling and other services to families of victims of homicides and other crimes. From 1994 to 1996, Espaillat served as the Director of Project Right Start, a national initiative funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to combat substance abuse by educating the parents of pre-school children.\n\nPrior to his election to the New York State Assembly, Espaillat was an active voice on New York City Community Board 12, and President of the 34th Precinct Community Council. Espaillat also served on Governor Mario Cuomo's Dominican-American Advisory Board from 1991-1993.\n\nEspaillat served in the New York State Assembly from 1997 to 2010. He was first elected after defeating 16-year incumbent John Brian Murtaugh in the 1996 Democratic Primary. Espaillat chaired the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic & Asian Legislative Caucus, and committees on small business and children & families.\n\nIn the Assembly, Espaillat was a vocal advocate for tenants, consumers, veterans, immigrants and local businesses. He passed laws encouraging the construction and preservation of affordable housing, giving low-income day care workers the right to organize and obtain health care, and sponsored measures to improve hospital translation services. He also established a higher education scholarship fund for relatives of the victims of American Airlines Flight 587, which crashed on November 12, 2001. Despite national Republican and conservative criticism, Espaillat strongly supported efforts in 2007 to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.\n\nAfter a wave of assaults and murders against livery cab drivers in 2000 that left over 10 dead, Espaillat passed legislation strengthening penalties for violent crimes against livery drivers and enabled their families to receive New York State Crime Victims Board funding. Livery cabs work in less affluent neighborhoods of New York that typically lack access to yellow cabs.\n\nEspaillat took legal action against power utility Con Edison after equipment failures led to a two-day blackout in Upper Manhattan, in July 1999, that caused financial damage to restaurants, bodegas and other small businesses. Con Edison subsequently agreed to invest an additional $100 million in Upper Manhattan electrical infrastructure at no cost to ratepayers and was required to refund customers billed for expenses related to the blackout.\n\nEspaillat ran for Senate in 2010 after incumbent Democrat Eric Schneiderman announced his campaign for New York Attorney General. Espaillat received more than 50% of the vote in a four-way Democratic party. In 2012, Espaillat defeated then-Assemblyman Guillermo Linares 62% - 38% in the Democratic Primary.\n\nFollowing his loss to Rangel in the Democratic primary, Espaillat announced his re-election bid for his State Senate seat, facing former City Councilman Robert Jackson.\n\nIn the end, Espaillat won his bid for re-election to the Senate over Jackson, 50.3% to 42.7%.\n\nIn 2011, Espaillat led the fight to safeguard and strengthen rent regulation for over 1 million affordable housing apartments that was set to expire that year. While tenant protections had been weakened in the past, the agreement reached that year made it more difficult to convert affordable housing to market rate and created a new Tenant Protection Unit within the state's housing agency.\n\nEspaillat also passed legislation increasing enforcement against businesses that sell alcohol to minors and authored the Notary Public Advertising Act, to crack down on unscrupulous public notaries who prey on vulnerable immigrants by offering fraudulent legal services. He voted in favor of marriage equality legislation in 2011.\n\n\nIn 2012, Espaillat ran in the Democratic primary for New York's 13th Congressional District, in a crowded field that included 42-year incumbent Charles Rangel. The seat had long been a majority-black district, but demographic change made it a 55 percent Hispanic district.\n\nIn the Democratic primary–the real contest in this heavily Democratic district–Rangel narrowly beat Espaillat 44% to 42%, with a margin of victory of less than 1,000 votes. Espaillat placed first in the Bronx section of the district and parts of Upper Manhattan.\n\nThe election was marked by reports that Spanish-speaking voters were either turned away at the polls or forced to use affidavit ballots. The New York City Board of Elections was also sharply criticized for its poor handling of the election and subsequent legal proceedings.\n\nIn 2014, Espaillat ran against incumbent Charlie Rangel again, losing for the second consecutive time, 47.7% to 43.1%.\n\nIn November 2015, Espaillat announced he would give up his State Senate seat to run for Congress again. He was running in an open seat; Rangel had announced in 2014 that he would not seek a 22nd term in 2016. In the Democratic primary, he narrowly defeated his nearest challenger, state assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, with 36 percent of the vote. As previously mentioned, the 13th is so heavily Democratic that Espaillat's primary victory virtually assured him of being its next congressman. As expected, he won the general election handily, taking over 81 percent of the vote.\n\nWhen Espaillat took office on January 3, 2017, he became only the third person to represent what is now the 13th in 72 years. Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. held the district from 1945 to 1971; Rangel had won the seat after defeating Powell in the 1970 primary. The district had been numbered as the 22nd District from 1945 to 1953, the 16th from 1953 to 1963, the 18th from 1963 to 1973, the 19th from 1973 to 1983, the 16th from 1983 to 1993, the 15th from 1993 to 2013, and has been the 13th since 2013.\n\nEspaillat serves as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and the Select Committee on Small Business. He is a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) and was appointed as Chairman of the CHC Task Force for Transportation, Infrastructure and Housing.\n\nIn August 2017, following the aftermath of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Espaillat and Pennsylvania Representative Dwight E. Evans introduced legislation banning Confederate monuments on federal property.\n\nEspaillat has been critical of Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro. In March 2019 he and 29 other Democratic lawmakers wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that read in part, \"Since the election of far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro as president, we have been particularly alarmed by the threat Bolsonaro's agenda poses to the LGBTQ+ community and other minority communities, women, labor activists, and political dissidents in Brazil.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 2003, he was living in Milan, Italy, from where he was kidnapped and tortured in Egypt. This \"\"Imam rapito affair\"\" prompted a series of investigations in Italy, culminating in the criminal convictions (in absentia) of 22 CIA operatives, a U.S. Air Force colonel, and two Italian accomplices, as well as Nasr, himself.\n\nHe is a member of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, an Islamic organisation that was formerly dedicated to the overthrow of the Egyptian government; the group has committed to peaceful means following the coup d'état that toppled Mohamed Morsi. The group has been linked to the murder of Anwar Sadat in 1981 and a terrorist campaign in the 1990s that culminated in the November 1997 Luxor massacre. As a result, it is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union. After the Egyptians declared the group illegal, Nasr sought asylum in Italy. During the 1990s he fought in Bosnia.\n\nOn 17 February 2003, Nasr was abducted by CIA agents as he walked to his mosque in Milan for noon prayers, thus becoming an effective ghost detainee. He was later transported to a prison in Egypt where, he states, he was tortured.\n\nIn April 2004, while his incarceration had been downgraded to house arrest, Nasr placed several phone calls from Egypt to his family and friends. He told them he had been rendered into the hands of Egypt's SSI at Tora Prison, twenty miles south of Cairo. He said he had been subjected to various depredations, tortured by beating and electric shocks to the genitals, raped, and eventually had lost hearing in one ear. At the time of the calls he had been released on the orders of an Egyptian judge because of lack of evidence. Shortly after those calls were made he was re-arrested and placed back in prison.\n\nNasr's case has been qualified by Swiss senator Dick Marty as a \"perfect example of extraordinary rendition\", and in Italy prompted a series of investigations and intrigues within the Italian intelligence community and criminal justice system collectively referred to as the \"Imam Rapito\" (or \"kidnapped Imam\") affair in the Italian press.\n\nIn February 2016, the European Court of Human Rights condemned Italy over this affair and ordered Italy to pay €115,000 (£90,000; $127,000) in damages and expenses to Nasr and his wife, Nabila Ghali.\n\nOn 4 November 2009, an Italian judge convicted \"in absentia\" 22 CIA agents, a U.S. Air Force (USAF) colonel and two Italian secret agents of the kidnap. Eight other American and Italian defendants were acquitted.\n\nFormer Milan CIA station chief, Robert Seldon Lady, received an eight-year prison sentence. USAF Lieutenant Colonel Joseph L. Romano, at the time of the conviction commander of the 37th Training Group of the 37th Training Wing, and 21 of the American defendants received five-year prison sentences. Those convicted were also ordered to each pay 1 million Euros to Nasr and 500,000 Euros to Nasr's wife.\n\nIn 2010, leaked diplomatic documents revealed the efforts the United States used in an attempt to stop Italy from indicting the CIA agents, and that Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi assured US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates that he was \"working hard to resolve the situation\" but that the Italy's judicial system was \"dominated by leftists\".\n\nIn July 2013, Robert Seldon Lady was initially detained in Panama at the request of Italian authorities, but then released and allowed to board a flight to the United States.\n\nIn January 2016, former C.I.A. agent Sabrina De Sousa, one of the agents convicted in Italy, was ordered by Portugal to be extradited to Italy, although that order will be appealed. She was briefly detained at the Lisbon airport in October 2015, and her passport was confiscated pending a court review of the European arrest warrant issued for her arrest. She has disclaimed any involvement in the affair and has been working to clear her name, including writing a memoir about her activities. Her appeal was denied on April 11, 2016. After being detained in Portugal in February 2017 and about to be deported to Italy, she was pardoned by the Italian president and released on 28th February 2017.\n\nOn 11 February 2007, Nasr's lawyer Montasser el-Zayat confirmed that his client had been released and was now back with his family. After four years of detention, an Egyptian court ruled that his imprisonment was \"unfounded.\"\n\nIn December, 2013, Nasr was convicted \"in absentia\" of terrorism by an Italian court for offenses before his abduction. Egypt had not responded to Italian requests to extradite or even interview Nasr for the trial. Nasr remains living in Egypt and is unlikely to be sent to Italy to serve out his sentence.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2118921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118921", "title": "Maxie Zeus", "text": "Maxie Zeus\n\nMaximilian \"Maxie\" Zeus is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, primarily as a minor enemy of Batman. The character is depicted as a mentally ill former history professor who is obsessed with Greek mythology and believes to be the god Zeus, becoming a crime lord in Gotham City.\n\nMaxie Zeus first appeared in \"Detective Comics\" #483 (April–May 1979) and was created by Denny O'Neil and Don Newton.\n\nMaxie Zeus is a former Greek history teacher who started to suffer from insanity when he lost his wife. He became a criminal mastermind and used his cunning and intelligence to rise to power amidst the chaos in Gotham City's underworld. He has fought Batman on several occasions before being committed to Arkham Asylum.\n\nBecause Maxie seemed less dangerous than Joker, Two-Face, and other notorious Arkham inmates, Arkham's administrators did not commit him in the maximum security wing, despite repeated recommendations from Batman to do so. Batman's concern was vindicated when Maxie escaped to form a team of Greek Mythology-based superhuman agents called the New Olympians. He attempted to kidnap Olympic athlete Lacinia Nitocris and force her to marry him and become a mother to his daughter Medea. This plot was foiled by Batman and the Outsiders, who bested the New Olympians in a series of Olympic-style games.\n\nMaxie was one of the villains that escaped Arkham when Bane brought down the walls of Arkham Asylum in the \"\" storyline. Maxie's escape attempt was disrupted when he collided with a tree.\n\nSome time later, however, he was drawn into a plot engineered by the Children of Ares—Deimos, Phobos—and Eris (Ares' sister) to merge Gotham City with Ares' throne capital, the Aeropagus. The intent was to re-establish Ares' rule on earth. Maxie was killed as a result of that plot, and his sacrifice brought about Ares' return. However, their scheme was foiled by Wonder Woman, Batman and their allies, and Ares himself banished his children back to Tartarus.\n\nIn issues of \"Robin\", a vigilante called Violet was trying to track down an illegal casino named \"Maxie's\", with chips bearing a Zeus-like profile. Presumably, Maxie survived his encounter with the Children of Ares. After Violet was discovered by Maxie Zeus's guards, both Robin and Violet managed to escape unharmed as detectives that Robin was working with on the case raided the casino and arrested Maxie Zeus, who surrendered without a fight after an officer physically threatened him.\n\nMaxie returns in Kevin Smith's \"\". Apparently cured of his delusions, he has been hired by Joker to use Joker Venom on random people on April First as an April Fool's Day joke, but instead mixes the poison with ecstasy to produce a new designer drug called \"Chuckles\". He uses the profits to fund his empire as well as building his dream of creating a public school that is run like a private school. The Joker, angry that his creation is being used for a noble purpose, swears revenge against Maxie. After witnessing the death of his nephew and a dozen other children when the Joker blows up a school, Maxie suffers a psychotic break and reverts to his Zeus persona. After Batman rescues him from an attack by the Joker at a nightclub, he visits Maxie again at his penthouse. After temporarily restoring Maxie's sanity with a massive dose of antipsychotics, Batman convinces him to confess and turn himself in to the police. This move is later revealed to be part of Batman's plan to lure the Joker and Onomatopoeia out of hiding.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, in the \"Batman Eternal\" story, Maxie Zeus is used as a host for the spirit of Deacon Blackfire as he attempts to use the spirits of the Arkham Asylum inmates to return to life only to be thwarted by Batwing and Jim Corrigan. Following Arkham Asylum's destruction, Maggie Sawyer attempts to get answers from Maxie Zeus on what happened.\n\nIn the \"Watchmen\" sequel \"Doomsday Clock\", Maxie Zeus was at Arkham Asylum when Rorschach was incarcerated there by Batman.\n\nAn electrified, emaciated version of Maxie Zeus appears in the graphic novel \"\" by Grant Morrison and Dave McKean. Batman finds him connected to the electroshock therapy room of Arkham Asylum, perpetually receiving electrical currents, which he believes to be \"fire from heaven\". On the one occasion in the story in which he and Batman cross paths, he compares himself to the supreme gods in many mythologies. He also does not recognize Batman, warmly addressing him as \"a pilgrim\". Early drafts of the script describes Zeus as resembling his original comic book counterpart, but with female breasts and genitalia crudely drawn on his filthy toga.\n\nIn \"The Batman Adventures\" (a comic series based on the animated series), Maxie Zeus escapes Arkham Asylum several times and teams up with villains such as Lex Luthor and Ra's al Ghul to destroy Gotham. Each time, he is foiled by Batman and Robin and returned to Arkham.\n\nIn an issue of \"The Batman Strikes!\", Maxie Zeus joins a group of villains led by the Joker. However, it is revealed that this is a simulation created by Batman to train Robin. On a later issue, Maxie Zeus goes on a criminal rampage alongside Ragdoll, Spellbinder, and an Everywhere Man, but is defeated by Batgirl.\n\nIn the \"Batman Beyond\" comic series, Bruce tells Terry a secured location where he has kept some of his most disturbed rogues in captivity. Maxie Zeus and Mad Hatter were among the catatonic inhabitants. It's possible that Maxie suffered a great deal from electro shock, brought on by the crude methods at Arkham Asylum, or from his delusions of godhood which forced him to wield a lightning-discharging staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118929", "title": "Solidarity", "text": "Solidarity\n\nSolidarity is an awareness of shared interests, objectives, standards, and sympathies creating a psychological sense of unity of groups or classes. It refers to the ties in a society that bind people together as one. The term is generally employed in sociology and the other social sciences as well as in philosophy and bioethics. It is also a significant concept in Catholic social teaching; therefore it is a core concept in Christian democratic political ideology.\n\nWhat forms the basis of solidarity and how it's implemented varies between societies. In developing societies it may be mainly based on kinship and shared values while more developed societies accumulate various theories as to what contributes to a sense of solidarity, or rather, social cohesion.\n\nSolidarity is also one of six principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and December 20 of each year is International Human Solidarity Day recognized as an international observance. Concepts of solidarity are mentioned in the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, but not defined clearly. As biotechnology and biomedical enhancement research and production increase, the need for distinct definition of solidarity within healthcare system frameworks is important. \n\nAccording to Émile Durkheim, the types of social solidarity correlate with types of society. Durkheim introduced the terms \"mechanical\" and \"organic solidarity\" as part of his theory of the development of societies in \"The Division of Labour in Society\" (1893). In a society exhibiting mechanical solidarity, its cohesion and integration comes from the homogeneity of individuals—people feel connected through similar work, educational and religious training, and lifestyle. Mechanical solidarity normally operates in \"traditional\" and small scale societies. In simpler societies (e.g., tribal), solidarity is usually based on kinship ties of familial networks. Organic solidarity comes from the interdependence that arises from specialization of work and the complementarities between people—a development which occurs in \"modern\" and \"industrial\" societies.\n\nAlthough individuals perform different tasks and often have different values and interest, the order and very solidarity of society depends on their reliance on each other to perform their specified tasks. \"Organic\" here is referring to the interdependence of the component parts, and thus social solidarity is maintained in more complex societies through the interdependence of its component parts (e.g., farmers produce the food to feed the factory workers who produce the tractors that allow the farmer to produce the food).\n\nA connection between the biological and the social was of principal importance for the idea of solidarity as expressed by the anarchist ideologist and former Prince Peter Kropotkin (1842–1921). In his most famous book, \"\" (1902), written partly in response to Huxleyan Social Darwinism, Kropotkin studied the use of cooperation as a survival mechanism in human societies at their various stages, as well as with animals. According to him, mutual aid, or cooperation, within a species has been an important factor in the evolution of social institutions. Solidarity is essential for mutual aid; supportive activity towards other people does not result from the expectation of reward, but rather from instinctive feelings of solidarity.\n\nIn his introduction to the book, Kropotkin wrote: \"The number and importance of mutual-aid institutions which were developed by the creative genius of the savage and half-savage masses, during the earliest clan-period of mankind and still more during the next village-community period, and the immense influence which these early institutions have exercised upon the subsequent development of mankind, down to the present times, induced me to extend my researches to the later, historical periods as well; especially, to study that most interesting period – the free medieval city republics, whose universality and influence upon our modern civilization have not yet been duly appreciated. And finally, I have tried to indicate in brief the immense importance which the mutual-support instincts, inherited by mankind from its extremely long evolution, play even now in our modern society, which is supposed to rest upon the principle \"every one for himself, and the State for all,\" but which it never has succeeded, nor will succeed in realizing\". Kropotkin advocated an alternative economic and social system, which would be coordinated through a horizontal network of voluntary associations with goods distributed in compliance with the physical needs of the individual, rather than according to labour.\n\nSolidarity is a re-emerging concept in contemporary philosophy within various sub-fields of law, ethics, and political philosophy. Early ancient philosophers such as Socrates and Aristotle discuss solidarity as a virtue ethics framework because in order to live a good life one must perform actions and behave in a way that is in solidarity with the community.\n\nOne notable approach in bioethics is to identify solidarity primarily as a three-tiered practice enacted at the interpersonal, communal, and contractual and legal levels. This approach is driven by the quest to differentiate between the diverse applications of the concept and to clarify its meaning, both historically and in terms of its potential as a fruitful concept for contemporary moral, social and political issues. The modern practice of bioethics is significantly influenced by Immanuel Kant's concept of the Categorical Imperative. Pastor and philosopher Fritz Jahr's article \"Bio-Ethics: A Review of the Ethical Relationships of Humans to Animals and Plants\" refines Kant's original Categorical Imperative discourse by including the notion of the Bioethical Imperative.\n\nBiomedical technology has also further introduced solidarity as the pivotal concept in bioethics. Scholars, such as Ori Levi, bring to attention the negative implications of biomedical enhancements. Another scholar, Dr. Meulen ter Ruud, discusses the application of solidarity within healthcare systems.\n\nFritz Jahr describes that bioethics is ultimately made up of \"academic discipline, principle, and virtue\". This echoes back to the deep influence Socrates has on the normalization of bioethics and its practices. Jahr utilizes Kant's Categorical Imperative to demonstrate the obligatory, yet innately human practice of the Bioethical Imperative:\"This results in the guiding principle for our actions is the \"Bioethical Imperative\": Respect every living being in general as an end in itself, and treat it if possible, as such\"as it arises in the relationships not only between conscious human being, but also with plants and other animal species. Jahr fully believes that in order to truly practice bioethics, one must be in solidarity with all forms of life. If one only decides to be in solidarity in humans, then one should not behave virtuously in any manner.\n\nSolidarity is an integral element of Catholic social teaching. According to Pope Francis:\nThe Church's teaching on solidarity is explained in the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, and briefly summarised in the Catechism of the Catholic Church:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2118948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118948", "title": "Amar Singh (cricketer)", "text": "Amar Singh (cricketer)\n\nNakum AmarSingh Ladha (4 December 1910 – 21 May 1940) was an Indian Test cricketer.\n\nA right-arm fast-medium bowler and effective lower-order batsman, Amar Singh Lodha played in seven Tests for India before World War II. He took 28 wickets in these matches. He was the first Indian Fast bowler and All-rounder, and the first Indian to receive a Test cap. He also scored India's first half-century in Test cricket, in India's first Test.\n\nAmar Singh Lodha played first-class cricket over a nine-year period; in 92 first-class matches he took 508 wickets at the bowling average of 18.35. He also scored five centuries as a batsman. In domestic cricket he was the first Indian to complete the all-rounder's double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets in the Ranji Trophy.\n\nAgainst England at Madras in 1933–34, Amar Singh Lodha scored 48 in the second essay after taking 7 for 86 off 44.4 overs in the visitors' first innings total of 335. At Lord's in 1936 he claimed 4/10 in his first nine overs and overall 6 for 35 from his 25.1 overs. In the next Test at Old Trafford he hit 48 not out to save India from an innings defeat. In the unofficial five-Test series against Lord Tennyson's MCC team of 1937–38 he captured 36 wickets at 16.66.\n\nMuch to the delight of the Burnley supporters, Amar Singh scored two centuries and six half-centuries. There was a 167 against Rishton, followed by a hard-hitting 112 versus East Lancashire, both at Turf Moore. Amar Singh topped the batting and bowling aggregates as well as averages. In all, he took 101 wickets at 12.11 in 360 overs; and scored 806 runs at 39.38 in 23 innings.\n\nAmar Singh Lodha along with Mohammad Nissar formed part of a duo of fast bowlers for India. Wally Hammond said that he was '\"as dangerous an opening bowler as I have ever seen\".\n\nIn club cricket he played for Colne in the Lancashire League. As the club's first overseas professional he was seen as a rival to Nelson's Learie Constantine and his arrival caused the club's gate receipts and membership to double.\n\nAccording to Wally Hammond, Amar Singh was \"as dangerous an opening bowler as I have ever seen, coming off the pitch like the crack of doom\". In an informal press meeting in 1970, Leonard Hutton said that \"There is no better bowler in the world today than Amar Singh.\" Len Hutton said this out of experience as he had played against Singh during his years with Yorkshire. Amar Singh also had an elder brother, Ladha Ramji, an aggressive fast bowler, who played a test for India against England in Bombay. His nephew, VL Nakum, also played first class cricket.\n\nSingh died on the morning of 21 May 1940 from pneumonia at his residence in Jamnagar.\n\nAmar Singh Lodha was one of the amateurs of the Indian team. With his bowling partner Nissar, the two fast bowlers were the centre of attraction on the first day of the match being played at Lord's. It was first Nissar who wreaked havoc with the English top order, dismissing the openers, Percy Holmes and Herbert Sutcliffe to reduce England 1 for 8 and 2 for 11.\n\nFrank Woolley, was later run out after adding none runs to their score. At 19 for 3, England were in deep trouble, but the legendary Wally Hammond, who would later go on to praise Singh lavishly, mounted a recovery with his Captain Douglas Jardine, the pair added 82 runs for the third wicket before giving Amar Singh his first wicket in test Cricket, later, Nissar carried on his fine work and took three more wickets, cleaning up the middle order, while CK Nayudu (who was the Indian Captain, and who took two for 40 in England's first innings), and Singh mopped up the tail as England were shot out for 259. Amar Singh bowled 31.1 overs, taking 2 for 75.\n\nIn Wisden's report of the test, it was noted that, \"Amar Singh bowled almost as well, making the ball curl in the air either from leg or from the off and causing it to come off the pitch at a tremendous pace.\" This was highly unexpected as England looked particularly strong on the batting front on paper. India, though, squandered their bowlers good work, and were all out for 189 runs, after they imploded after being 153 for 4. England started their second innings badly as well, losing Sutcliffe, after an opening stand of 30, to Amar Singh. From that point on, Jahangir khan, another Indian fast bowler, ran through England's middle order, taking 4 for 60. Amar Singh bowled for 41 overs, taking 2 for 84. However, Wisden heaped praise on the Indian fast bowler, stating, \"When England went in a second time, Amar Singh bowled even better than before\". England declared at 275 for 8, with Jardine once again displaying an excellent temperament, scored 85 not out to go with his 79 in the first innings, another innings which was highly received by Wisden and spectators alike, as one particular onlooker's reports, which was retrieved by The Cricketer, praised his gritty innings, stating \"Luckily England had in Jardine, the captain, a steel-hearted warrior to hold the pass\".\n\nThus, India, set a target of 346 in the second innings, came out to bat, but were outclassed by England's superior bowling. In fact, Wisden stated in its match reports, that \"India fared so badly that they lost seven wickets for 108 ...\". However, it was Amar Singh, this time, who displayed his lower-order batting prowess, hitting 51 with the help of one six. He added 74 runs for the eighth wicket with Lall Singh, who scored 29 runs. Ultimately, Amar Singh was the last man out for 187, and India lost by 158 runs.\n\nAmar Singh Lodha played the rest of his six test matches against England, producing several of his best displays, including 4 for 106 in Kolkata in 1934, 6 or 35 at Lord's in 1936, and his career-best figures of 7 for 86 in the Chennai match in 1934. However, he bowled more than thirty-five overs in an innings on six occasions, giving rise to the perception that he was perhaps being used as a workhorse.\n\nAmar Singh was a tall man; standing at over six feet and two inches, Amar Singh used this height advantage to great effect. He was wiry and broad shouldered. Though not really fast, Amar Singh used his height to extract bounce and movement off the pitch. He was said to have had a clean action, and generated lots of energy from a run-up of a little more than a dozen yards. This was the reason why English conditions suited him well. Amar Singh was also said to have had the ability to exploit the new ball well, making it swing both the ways, and when the shine was off, his \"devastating breakback often penetrated the defense of well set batsmen, castling them comprehensively\".\n\nOne reason for Amar Singh's high number of wickets was that he bowled with an aggressive field setting and more importantly, he aimed at the stumps while bowling. His field settings generally consisted of two or three slips, a gully, a cover point, and third man on the off side. On the leg side he usually had a short fine leg, a forward short leg, a silly mid-on and a long leg. He maintained this field against all batsmen.\n\nAmar Singh's batting was more or less as much as aggressive as his bowling. He was a pinch-hitter, who was effective on some occasions. Surprisingly, Amar Singh was shifted up the batting order. He was also made to play in the top five positions three times; but, also scored four scores above forty. In the summer of his first test match, Amar Singh hit an unbeaten 131, against Lancashire, coming at no.10, a position from which he had scored his 51 against England in his first test match.\n\nIn the light of his bowling performances, another aspect of his game that had been overshadowed along with his batting was Singh's fielding an catching. In 92 first class matches, Singh snaffled 77 catches, and according to Rusi Modi, he was easily as good as Bob Simpson or Wally Hammond in terms of slip catching. However, it is highly debatable whether India's other fielders were as good, as it is reported that many edges of Nissar's and Singh's bowling were dropped .\n\n"}

{"id": "2118965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118965", "title": "Golowan Festival", "text": "Golowan Festival\n\nGolowan (sometimes also Goluan or Gol-Jowan) is the Cornish language word for the Midsummer celebrations in Cornwall, UK; widespread prior to the late 19th century and most popular in the Penwith area and in particular Penzance and Newlyn. The celebrations were centred on the lighting of bonfires and fireworks and the performance of associated rituals. The midsummer bonfire ceremonies (\"Tansys Golowan\" in Cornish) were revived at St Ives in 1929 by the Old Cornwall Society and since then spread to other societies across Cornwall, as far as Kit Hill near Callington. Since 1991 the Golowan festival in Penzance has revived many of these ancient customs and has grown to become a major arts and culture festival; its central event 'Mazey Day' now attracts tens of thousands of people to the Penzance area in late June.\n\nThe 2020 Golowan Festival dates are 19 June to 28 June with Mazey Day taking place on Saturday 27 June.\n\nThe ancient festival was first described by Dr William Borlase in 1754 in his book \"Antiquities of Cornwall\".\nThe Penzance Golowan was one of the last examples of this practice in Cornwall until its prohibition by the Penzance Borough Council in the 1890s due to increased insurance premiums in the town and perceived fire risk. The celebrations themselves were centred on the lighting of fireworks, tar barrels, and torches on the evening of 23 June every year (St John's Eve). Towards the end of these festivities the local youths of the town would take part in the ancient serpent dance and jump or pass themselves through the dying embers of the flames. During these celebrations it was also usual to elect a Mock Mayor or Mayor of the Quay.\nIn 1864 it was recorded that the organising committee of the festival let off \"258 dozen fire crackers and numerous Roman Candles, Jack-in-box and sky rockets\" The day after these celebrations, a 'Midsummer's Day' fair took place on Penzance quay; boat rides and other entertainments were included in these celebrations.\n\nTwo descriptions of the fire festival in Victorian times follow below:\n\nPorthleven and Newlyn in particular being centres for much of the celebration of St Peter's-tide because of St Peter's role as the patron saint of fishermen. St Peter's-tide is still celebrated in Porthleven however in a far more muted fashion Porthleven Petertide. M. A. Courtney in her book \"Cornish Feasts and Feasten Customs\" describes a delay to the Newlyn festivities in 1883 when the majority of the Newlyn fishing fleet were at sea, returning to celebrate the fire festival many days after the actual event. Polperro is also believed to be the site of major St Peter's Eve celebrations. Mevagissey feast which occurs around St Peter's Eve continues to be celebrated.\n\nThe people of St Just in Penwith had their own particular practices, Lake's Parochial history of Cornwall (1868) states:\n\nThroughout Europe there are similar fire festivals held on the 23 and 24 June. St. John's Eve in Ireland, Jāņi in Latvia and Saint Jonas' Festival are but a few examples. Golowan is just one example of a much wider Midsummer European tradition.\nThe modern Golowan Festival in Penzance started in 1991 as an attempt to revive many of the traditions stated above and has grown into one of the UK's most distinctive festivals. The core of the modern festival is long weekend which includes Mazey Eve, Mazey Day and Quay Fair Day. Thursday features a popular election of the 'Mayor of the Quay' and the Friday, Mazey Eve takes place around the harbour area of Penzance from where there is large firework display. The following day – Mazey Day is a large community and arts celebration. Schools, entertainers, community groups and others take part in a series of processions that include music, giant sculptures and variety of other artistic activities. Contributions from musicians and artists from the Celtic nations are a regular feature as are a variety of other musical contributions. Penzance itself during this day is decorated with large amounts of greenery – mirroring the practice in the town during the ancient festival. A large number of market stalls are also present throughout the town. Mazey Day attracts thousands of visitors to the area and has become an important symbol of the identity of town amongst local people. Quay Fair day is a celebration that is similar in many ways to 'Midsummer Fair' described in the ancient festival with the addition of popular street entertainment.\n\nIn October 2015 Penzance Town Council outsourced the running of the festival to a not-for-profit community interest company, which, having run the festival successfully from 2016 to 2019, has now been contracted to run the Festival till 2021.\".\n\nDuring the evening of Mazey Eve and on 23 June (St John's Eve) every year Penglaz the Penzance 'Obby 'Oss appears. Penglaz owes its origins to the descriptions of the hobby horse that once accompanied the Christmas guise dancers in their perambulation of Penzance during the nineteenth century. The classic, contemporary account of the guise dancers' horse was given by Richard Edmonds who described the horse as being:\n\nThe horse was a character associated with 'Old Penglaze' in the guise dancers' games of forfeiture, described by William Sandys:\n\nBarbara Spooner in her work on the Padstow 'Obby 'Oss further describes the 'Obby 'Oss associated with \"Old Penglaze\".\n\nHer description is of the 'mast' type of hobby horse, and Spooner followed Robert Morton Nance in expressing the view that 'the May day games and Morris Dances, with their own type of hobby-horse, which includes a rider, had been brought in from England too recently to have acquired Cornish names.’It became imperative amongst the Celtic Revivalists of the early twentieth century that the Tourney horse (with its rider) should be seen as English, or foreign, whereas the mast horses were to be understood as native, Celtic beasts, complete with Celtic names. In fact, as Edwin Cawte demonstrated in his study of British and European hobby horse practices, the mast type of horse developed during the eighteenth century and was particularly popular during the nineteenth, whereas the Tourney variety predated it by several centuries.\n\nIn his Cornish dictionary, Robert Morton Nance believed the character of Old Penglaze to be the horse and believed that Penglaze was a genuine Celtic noun for a hobby horse, something one of the above mentioned quotations contradicts. Moreover the writer of Bewnans Meriasek, the life of St. Meriasek (or Meriadoc) of Camborne, writing in Cornish, understood the hobby horse as feminine in gender, whereas Penglaze is masculine, potentially undermining its status as an example of Cornish language.\n\nRegardless of the accuracy of its linguistic origins and accuracy of naming, etc., the modern Golowan festival's Penglaz takes its appearance from the later quotations descriptions and resembles strongly the Mari Lwyd of Welsh tradition and was first introduced in 1992 at the second revived Golowan festival by Merv Davey Hon piper of Gorseth Kernow. The original horse now forming part of Cornish music group Pyba's Guise dance programme being renamed \"Penguise\". The current \"Oss\" being used for the first time in 1993 .\n\nThe ancient Golowan celebrations were also the inspiration for the Old Cornwall Societies' midsummer bonfire celebrations. The hilltop bonfires that form a chain are currently held at Kit Hill, St Breock beacon, Castle An Dinas, and Redruth.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118972", "title": "Mir Osman Ali Khan", "text": "Mir Osman Ali Khan\n\nNawab Mir Sir Osman Ali Khan Siddiqi, Asaf Jah VII (6 April 1886 – 24 February 1967), was the last Nizam (ruler) of the princely state of Hyderabad, the largest princely state in British India. He ascended the throne on 11th August, 1911, at the age of 25 and ruled Hyderabad between 1911 and 1948, until it was annexed by India. He was styled as His Exalted Highness-(H.E.H.) the Nizam of Hyderabad. He was one of the wealthiest people of all time. In 1937, he was featured on the cover of \"Time\" magazine as the richest person at the time. He was the 5th richest man in history of mankind and the richest Indian who ever lived.\n\nOn taking the throne, he studied and understood all the State papers that his father sent to him.\n\nHe was a benevolent ruler who patronised education, science and development. During his 37-year rule, electricity was introduced, railways, roads and airways were developed. He was known as \"Architect of modern Hyderabad\" and is credited with the establishment of numerous public institutions in the city of Hyderabad, including the Osmania University, Osmania General Hospital, State Bank of Hyderabad, Begumpet Airport, and Hyderabad High Court to name a few. Two reservoirs, namely Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar were built during his reign, to prevent another great flood in the city.\n\nHe was also a philanthropist, donating millions of rupees to various educational and religious institutions all over India. Apart from his wealth, he was known for his eccentricities, as he used to knit his own socks, and borrow cigarettes from guests.\n\nThe Nizam didn't want to join Indian union. After India's independence in 1947, the Nizam did not wish to accede his state to the newly formed nation. By then, his power had weakened due to the Telangana movement and rise of a radical militia known as the Razakars. In 1948, the Indian Army invaded and annexed Hyderabad State, and the Nizam had to surrender. Post independence, he became the Rajpramukh of Hyderabad State between 1950 and 1956, after which the state was partitioned and became part of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra. The Nizam died in 1967.\n\nThe infamous mines of Golconda were the major source of wealth for the Nizam's, with the Kingdom of Hyderabad being the only supplier of Diamonds for the global market in the 18th century.\n\nMir Osman Ali Khan acceded as the Nizam of Hyderabad upon the death of his father in 1911. The state of Hyderabad was the largest of the princely states in pre-independence India. With an area of 86,000 square miles (223,000 km²), it was roughly the size of the present-day United Kingdom. The Nizam was the highest-ranking prince in India, was one of only five princes entitled to a 21-gun salute, held the unique title of \"Nizam\", and was titled \"His Exalted Highness\" and \"Faithful Ally of the British Crown\"\n\nIn 1908, three years before the Nizam's coronation, the city of Hyderabad was struck by a major flood that resulted in the death of thousands. The Nizam, on the advice of Sir M. Visvesvaraya, ordered the construction of two large reservoirs, namely the Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar to prevent another flood.\n\nHe was given the title of \"Faithful Ally of the British Crown\" after World War One due to his financial contribution to the British Empire's war effort. (For example, No. 110 Squadron RAF's original complement of Airco DH.9A aircraft were Osman Ali's gift. Each aircraft bore an inscription to that effect, and the unit became known as the \"Hyderabad Squadron\".) He also paid for a Royal Navy vessel, the N-class destroyer, commissioned in 1940 and transferred to the Royal Australian Navy.\n\nIn 1918, the Nizam issued a \"firman\" that brought into existence the Osmania University, the first university to have Urdu as a medium of instruction. The present campus was completed in 1934.\n\nIn 1919, the Nizam ordered the formation of the Executive Council of Hyderabad, presided by Sir Sayyid Ali Imam, and with eight other members, each in charge of one or more departments. The President of the Executive Council would also be the Prime Minister of Hyderabad.\n\nThe Begumpet Airport was established in the 1930s with formation of Hyderabad Aero Club by the Nizam. Initially it was used as a domestic and international airport for the Nizam's Deccan Airways, the earliest airline in British India. The terminal building was created in 1937.\n\nHe arranged a matrimonial alliance between his first son Azam Jah and Princess Durrushehvar of the Ottoman Empire. It was believed at that time that the matrimonial alliance between the Nizam and the deposed Caliph would lead to the emergence of a Muslim ruler who could be acceptable to the world powers in place of the Ottoman Sultans. After India's Independence, the Nizam made vain attempts to declare his sovereignty over the state of Hyderabad, either as a protectorate of the British Empire, or as a sovereign monarchy. However, his power weakened due to the Telangana rebellion and rise of the Razakars, a radical Muslim militia who wanted Hyderabad to remain under Muslim rule. In 1948, India invaded and annexed Hyderabad State, and the rule of the Nizam ended wherein the Nizam became the Rajpramukh and served from 26 January 1950 to 31 October 1956.\n\nNearly all the major public buildings and institutions in Hyderabad city, such as Osmania General Hospital, Hyderabad High Court, Jubilee Hall, Nizamia Observatory, Nizamia Hospital, Moazzam Jahi Market, Kachiguda Railway Station, Asafiya Library now known as the State Central Library, Hyderabad, Town Hall now known as the Assembly Hall, Hyderabad Museum now known as the State Museum and many other monuments were built under his reign. He also built the Hyderabad House in Delhi, now used for diplomatic meetings by the Government of India.\n\nFrom giving donations to major educational institutions throughout India, he introduced many educational reforms during his reign. Almost 11% of the Nizam's budget was spent on education.\n\nHe made large donations to many institutions in India and abroad with special emphasis given to educational institutions such as the Jamia Nizamia and the Darul Uloom Deoband.\n\nHe founded the Osmania University; today it is one of the biggest universities in India. Schools, colleges and a Department for Translation were set up. Primary education was made compulsory and provided free for the poor.\n\nIn 1941, he started his own bank, the \"Hyderabad State Bank\" (later renamed State Bank of Hyderabad and, in 2017, merged into the State Bank of India) as the state's central bank. It was established on 8 August 1941 under the Hyderabad State Bank Act. The bank managed the \"Osmania Sikka\", the currency of the state of Hyderabad. It was the only state in India which had its own currency, the Hyderabadi rupee. Hyderabad was the only state in British India where the ruler was allowed to issue currency notes. In 1953, the bank absorbed, by merger, the Mercantile Bank of Hyderabad, which Raja Pannalal Pitti had founded in 1935.\n\nIn 1956, the Reserve Bank of India took over the bank as its first subsidiary and renamed it State Bank of Hyderabad. The Subsidiary Banks Act was passed in 1959. On 1 October 1959, SBH and the other banks of the princely states became subsidiaries of SBI. It merged with SBI on 31 March 2017.\n\nAfter the Great Musi Flood of 1908, which killed an estimated 50,000 people, the Nizam constructed 2 lakes to prevent another great flood, namely Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar named after himself, and his son (Azam Jah)-Mir Himayat Ali Khan respectively.\n\nThe foundation of agricultural research in Marathwada region of erstwhile Hyderabad State was laid by the Nizam with the commencement of the Main Experimental Farm in 1918 in Parbhani. During the Nizam's rule agricultural education was available only at Hyderabad; crop research centres for sorghum, cotton and fruits existed in Parbhani. After independence, this facility was developed further by the Indian government which was renamed as Marathwada Agriculture University on 18 May 1972.\n\nIndia's first airport - the Begumpet Airport was established in the 1930s with the formation of the Hyderabad Aero Club by Nizam.\nInitially it was used as a domestic and international airport by Nizam and was known as \"Deccan Airways Limited\" - the first airline during British India. The airport building was built in 1937.\n\nThe Nizam possessed such enormous wealth that he was portrayed on the cover of TIME magazine on 22 February 1937, being described as the world's richest man. He used the Jacob Diamond, a 185-carat diamond that is part of the Nizam's jewellery, a precious collection running into several thousand crores of rupees today, as a paperweight. During his days as Nizam, he was reputed to be the richest man in the world, having a fortune estimated at US$2 billion in the early 1940s ($ today) or 2 per cent of the US economy then. At that time the treasury of the newly independent Union government of India reported annual revenue of US$1 billion only.\n\nThe Nizam is known to have remained as the richest man in South Asia until his death in 1967, but his fortunes fell to US$1 billion by then as more than 97% of his wealth, including jewellery belonging to his family including his daughter's and grand daughters, was taken away by the newly formed Indian Government. Just prior to his death, the Nizam's personal fortune was roughly estimated to be £110 million, including £40 million in gold and jewels (equivalent to £ in ).\n\nThe Indian government still exhibits the jewellery as Nizam's jewellery Exhibition (now in Delhi). There are 173 jewels, which include emeralds weighing nearly , and pearls exceeding 40 thousand chows. The collection includes gemstones, turban ornaments, necklaces and pendants, belts and buckles, earrings, armbands, bangles and bracelets, anklets, cufflinks and buttons, watch chains, and rings, toe rings, and nose rings.\n\nIn 1947, the Nizam made a gift of diamond jewels, including a tiara and necklace, to Queen Elizabeth on the occasion of her marriage. The brooches and necklace from this gift are still worn by the Queen and is known as the Nizam of Hyderabad necklace.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge has also been spotted wearing the necklace on a few occasions.\n\nThe Nizam donated Rs.82,825 to the Yadagirigutta temple at Bhongir, Rs.29,999 to Sita Ramachandraswamy temple, Bhadrachalam and Rs. 8,000 to Tirupati Balaji Temple. \n\nHe also donated Rs.50,000 towards the re-construction of Sitarambagh temple located in the old city of Hyderabad.\n\nAfter hearing about the Golden Temple of Amritsar through Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Mir Osman Ali Khan started giving yearly grants towards it.\n\nHe also donated Rs 10 Lakh for the Banaras Hindu University, Rs. 5 Lakh for the Aligarh Muslim University, and 3 lakhs for the Indian Institute of Science.\n\nIn 1932, there was a need for money for the publication of the Holy Mahabharata in the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute located in Pune. A formal request was made to the 7th Nizam (Mir Osman Ali Khan) who granted Rs.1000 per year for a period of 11 years. \n\nHe also gave Rs 50,000 for construction of the guest house which stands today as the \"Nizam Guest House\".\n\nAccording to an urban legend, Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan donated 5,000 kg of gold to the National Defence Fund of India in the aftermath of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. The legend claims that Nizam gave the gold to Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri in 1965, when the latter visited Hyderabad during an India-wide tour to raise funds for the post-war economy. According to the story, Nizam asked only the boxes containing the gold to be returned.\n\nIn reality, the Nizam did not donate 5,000 kg of gold, he invested 425 kg of gold in the National Defence Gold Scheme. The Scheme was floated by the government in October 1965 to deal with an economic crisis, and the investors were offered a 6.5% interest rate. The scheme included an amnesty clause: the gold acquired using income not disclosed to the income tax authorities was exempted from tax, if invested in the scheme. The Nizam indeed met Shastri in Hyderabad, and agreed to invest 425 kg of old gold mohurs (coins), which were valued at 5 million at the time. Shastri later thanked the Nizam at a public meeting, stating that the government planned to send these gold coins to foreign countries, expecting to obtain 10 million in return.\n\nIt is not clear who received the return on this investment. In 2018, the Nizam's grandson Mir Najaf Ali Khan stated that according to his knowledge, none of the 52 trusts created by the Nizam had received any money from this investment. English-language newspaper \"The Hindu\" submitted a Right to Information query to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2018 asking for information on the investment and the final beneficiary. However, the RBI refused to provide this information, citing \"unwarranted invasion of the privacy\" clause of the RTI law.\n\nAfter Indian independence in 1947, the country was partitioned into India and Pakistan. The princely states were left free to make whatever arrangement they wished with either India or Pakistan. The Nizam ruled over more than 16 million people and of territory when the British withdrew from the sub-continent in 1947. The Nizam refused to join either India or Pakistan, preferring to form a separate independent kingdom within the British Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nThis proposal for independence was rejected by the British government, but the Nizam continued to explore it. Towards this end, he kept up open negotiations with the Government of India regarding the modalities of a future relationship while opening covert negotiations with Pakistan in a similar vein. The Nizam cited the Razakars as evidence that the people of the state were opposed to any agreement with India.\n\nUltimately the new Indian government decided to invade and capture Hyderabad in 1948, in an operation code named Operation Polo. Under the supervision of Major General Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri, one division of the Indian Army and a tank brigade invaded Hyderabad.\n\nThe Nizam was the honorary Colonel of the 20 Deccan Horse. In 1918, Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan Siddqi Bahadur was elevated by King George V from \"His Highness\" to \"His Exalted Highness\". In a letter dated 24 January 1918, the title \"Faithful Ally of the British Government\" was conferred on him.\n\nThe Nizam lived at King Kothi Palace — bought from a nobleman—for all his life from age 13. He never moved to Chowmahalla Palace, even after his accession to the throne.\n\nUnlike his father, he was not interested in fine clothing or hunting. His hobbies rather included along the likes of poetry and writing Urdu ghazals.\n\nHe revered his mother a lot, visiting her every day till she was alive; and later used to visit her grave almost every day of his life.\n\nOn 14 April 1920, the Nizam married Sahebzadi Azmath unnisa Begum (Dulhan Pasha Begum) (1889–1955), daughter of Nawab Jahangir Jung Bahadur, at Eden Bagh now known as Eden Garden at King Kothi, Hyderabad at the age of 21. Nawab Mir Khudrath Nawaz Jung Bahadur was the first brother-in-law of the Nizam.\nand the uncle of his sons Azam Jah (1907–1970), and Moazzam Jah (1907–1987)\n\nThe Nizams first son - Azam Jah married Durru Shehvar, daughter of Abdul Mejid II (Heir to the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire). They had two children, Mukarram Jah and Muffakham Jah. \n\nWhereas, his 2nd son Moazzam Jah married Princess Niloufer, a princess of the Ottoman empire.\n\nIn total the Nizam had 34 children: 18 sons and 16 daughters.\n\nMir Najaf Ali Khan is another grandson of the last Nizam who is a well known figure as he represents several trusts of the last Nizam, including the H.E.H. the Nizam's Charitable Trust and the Nizam Family Welfare Association.\n\nThe Nizam continued to stay at the King Kothi Palace until his death. He used to issue \"firmans\" on inconsequential matters in his newspaper, the Nizam Gazette.\nHe died on Friday, 24 February 1967. He had willed that he be buried in Masjid-e Judi, a mosque where his mother was buried, that faced King Kothi Palace. The government declared state mourning on 25 February 1967, the day when he was buried. State government offices remained closed as a mark of respect while the National Flag of India was flown at half-mast on all the government buildings throughout the state. The Nizam Museum documents state : \"The streets and pavements of the city were littered with the pieces of broken glass bangles as an incalculable number of women broke their bangles in mourning, which Telangana women usually do as per Indian customs on the death of a close relative.\"\n\nMillions of people of all religions of different parts of the State entered Hyderabad in trains, buses and bullocks to see the last glimpse of their king's mortal remains in a coffin box in the King Kothi Palace Camp in Hyderabad. The crowd was so uncontrollable that barricades were installed alongside the road to enable people to move in the queue. The Nizam's funeral procession was the biggest non-religious, non-political meeting of people in the history of India till that date. D. Bhaskara Rao, chief curator, of the Nizam's Museum stated that an estimated \"one million\" people were part of the procession.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The book was published irregularly by Burlyman Entertainment.\n\nThe last issue \"Shaolin Cowboy\" #7 hit the stands in May 2007, a year after #6 went on sale. \n\nAt the 2011 Toronto, San Diego and New York Comic Cons, Dark Horse Comics announced that they would be publishing three new \"Shaolin Cowboy\" comics, starting with a new Number One. The first issue of the new Dark Horse series has been solicited for release on October 9, 2013 as an ongoing series.\n\nIn 2017, Dark Horse Comics published a new 4-part series, written and drawn by Darrow, called \"Who'll Stop The Reign?\" The series ran from April to July 2017 and was colored by Dave Stewart. Variant covers for the issues were produced by Frank Miller, Frank Cho, Sergio Aragones and Gendy Tartakovsky.\n\nThe book is about an unnamed former Shaolin monk who wanders the land with a talking mule named Lord Evelyn Dunkirk Winniferd Esq. the Third. Having been \"asked\" to leave the Shaolin temple, he has since had a bounty placed on his head, which many are eager to collect. Given the Shaolin Cowboy's prowess in martial arts, however, this will be very difficult.\n\nTaking place in an unspecified time setting (as the first issue notes, \"the day after yesterday and a week before tomorrow\"), the book features extremely detailed artwork and equally violent and absurd action scenes; in one, the main character battles a giant shark with a human head in its mouth using two chainsaws tied on the ends of a long stick – which all takes place in the canalization in the stomach of a lizard, on whose back a city is located.\n\nSix issues of the Burlyman seven issue series were translated into French and collected into a number of trade paperbacks by Panini Comics:\n\n\nBurlyman released a 208 page trade paperback called \"Geoff Darrow's The Shaolin Cowboy\" on December 3, 2014 that collected their entire 7-issue series.\n\nDark Horse released a 144 page hardcover called \"The Shaolin Cowboy: Shemp Buffet\" on March 4, 2015 that collected their first entire 4-issue series.\n\nDark Horse released a 128 page hardcover called \"The Shaolin Cowboy: Who'll Stop the Reign?\" on October 25, 2017 that collected their second entire 4-issue series.\n\nDark Horse reprinted all seven of the original issues of \"Shaolin Cowboy\" as published by Burlyman in a hardcover edition on July 18, 2018, titled \"Shaolin Cowboy: Start Trek\".\n\n\"Shaolin Cowboy\" was nominated for three Eisner Awards in 2005 for \"Best New Series\", \"Best Penciller/Inker or Penciller/Inker Team\", and \"Best Coloring\".\n\n"}

It shares the drought and shade resistance of the other varieties.\n\nThis grass has a fine, soft texture and can be left unmowed as it only grows to a height of . When left unmowed, it forms a humpy convoluted surface which is sometimes used in oriental landscapes (see picture on Zoysia page).\n\nEmerald Zoysia is adapted to zones 7-11 and does well in warm, humid environments. It is an excellent grass for the southern and southeastern states. Once established it requires less water than St. Augustine but slightly more than Bermuda. It is drought tolerant due to its deep root structure. Browning may occur in triple digit heat, but adequate hydration can restore its vibrant green color in a matter of minutes. The grass is moderately shade tolerant, coming close to the shade tolerance of St. Augustine. However, it does not do well in full shade as compared to Rye and Fescue. An average of at least 3–4 hours of full sun per day is a good measure for healthy growth. Flooding is tolerated, but constant saturation will eventually weaken the grass. This zoysia has a moderate cold tolerance and can be damaged by hard freezes and is not hardy in transition zones. Emerald Zoysia is a very slow growing lawn grass. Zoysia grasses are generally slower growing than Bermuda and St. Augustine, with Emerald Zoysia being one of the slowest growing Zoysia grasses. The grass exhibits a dense creeping growth, rather than an aggressive upward, or sprawling growth. The blade density is much higher than other grasses, giving a very dense, carpet-like, or \"hedgehog\" appearance.\n\nDue to the density of the grass, excess thatch can accumulate and should be removed every several weeks. Mowing can be performed every 7–10 days, with no more than 1/3 of the blade cut at one time. Recommended mowing height of this grass is between . Mowing the grass shorter than this height can produce a weaker less attractive product, whereas mowing the grass higher than this height will promote a less-dense, wispy appearance. The use of reel mowers are suggested since common rotary lawn mowers will tear the fine-blade grass and leave a grey/white tip instead of a clean cut.\n\nEmerald Zoysia has an adverse reaction to excessive fertilization, requiring no more than two light distributions per year. 8-8-8 or 13-13-13 fertilizer is recommended. If over fertilized, it will turn yellow and could die. Since regrowth of this grass is slow, its best to err on the light side of fertilization than to over fertilize.\n"}

As an 18-year-old he scored a historic century at Lord's in 1967, hitting the last two balls of the match for six to secure for victory for the Indian Schoolboys against England Schoolboys. He scored a century on Test debut against New Zealand in 1976.\n\nSurinder Amarnath made his first-class debut in December 1963, a few days before he turned 15, in a match played in Poona to raise money for the national Defence Fund. In the same match his father, Lala Amarnath, playing for the opposing team, played his last first-class match at the age of 52. Surinder scored 86 on debut.\n\nSurinder began playing for Northern Punjab in the Ranji Trophy in 1964–65, and scored his first century against Delhi in 1966–67. Still a schoolboy, he toured England with the Indian Schools team in 1967. In the match against MCC Schools at Lord’s, as an 18-year-old, he scored 104 not out, hitting the last two balls of the match for six to take his team to victory.\n\nAmarnath scored not-out double-centuries in the Ranji Trophy for Punjab against Madhya Pradesh in 1971–72 and against Delhi in 1972–73. He played his first match for India in an unofficial Test against the touring Sri Lankans in 1975–76, scoring 118 in a low-scoring match that India won by 64 runs. He was selected for the tour of New Zealand that followed shortly afterwards.\n\nHe scored a century on his Test debut against New Zealand in January 1976, making 124 and adding 204 for the second wicket with Sunil Gavaskar. He played the full three Test series in New Zealand, but did not score higher than 27 in five innings after his debut century. He then played two Tests during the tour to the West Indies in 1976, and then two more against England at home in India in 1977, during which he scored two half centuries. After returning early from the 1977–78 tour to Australia due to injury, Surinder made half century against Pakistan in Lahore in October 1978, but he was dropped after the last of his 10 Tests came in November 1978 against Pakistan. He also played three One Day Internationals, all against Pakistan in 1978, with a high score of 62. \n\nHe continued playing domestic cricket after being dropped from the national side. Playing for Delhi against the Rest of India in the 1980–81 Irani Trophy match he made 235 not out, establishing an Irani Trophy record that stood for 38 years. His last season as a first-class cricketer was the 1985–86 season. \n\nIn summarising Amarnath's career, Partab Ramchand writes \"given the brilliant start to his Test career, and the promise he held out, Surinder Amarnath's overall figures may be disappointing. But he was given a raw deal by the selectors.\" A very aggressive batsman, Ramchand wrote of him, \"Surinder could be [a] bit flashy but when in full flow he was a treat to watch and could decimate even the best of attacks\".\n\nSurinder Amarnath's father Lala and brother Mohinder also represented India at Test level. Another brother, Rajinder, played first-class cricket from 1971 to 1987, mostly for Haryana. Surinder’s son Digvijay has played first-class cricket in Sri Lanka.\n\n"}

{"id": "2119021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2119021", "title": "The Canterbury Tales (film)", "text": "The Canterbury Tales (film)\n\nThe Canterbury Tales () is a 1972 Italian film directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini and based on the medieval narrative poem \"The Canterbury Tales\" by Geoffrey Chaucer. It is the second film in Pasolini's \"Trilogy of Life\", the others being \"The Decameron\" and \"Arabian Nights\". It won the Golden Bear at the 22nd Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nThe adaptation covers eight of the 24 tales and contains abundant nudity, sex and slapstick humour. Many of these scenes are present or at least alluded to in the original as well, but some are Pasolini's own additions.\n\nThe film sometimes diverges from Chaucer. For example, \"The Friar's Tale\" is significantly expanded upon: where the Friar leads in with a general account of the archdeacon's severity and the summoner's corruption, Pasolini illustrates this with a specific incident which has no parallel in Chaucer. Two men are caught in an inn bedroom having sex. One is able to bribe his way out of trouble, but the other, poorer man is less fortunate: he is tried and convicted of sodomy—it does not occur to the judge that such an act cannot be committed by \"one\" person alone—and is sentenced to death. This may be due to the belief of the period that the party who was \"receiving,\" (woman or man), was the more innocent one since the \"giver\" was assumed to have initiated the act. As a foretaste of Hell, he is burned alive inside an iron cage (\"roasted on a griddle\" in the words of one spectator) while vendors sell beer and various baked and roasted foods to the spectators.\n\nSet in England in the Middle Ages, stories of peasants, noblemen, clergy and demons are interwoven with brief scenes from Chaucer's home life and experiences implied to be the basis for the Canterbury Tales. Each episode does not take the form of a story told by different pilgrim, as is the case in Chaucer's stories, but simply appear in sequence, seemingly without regard for the way that the tales relate to one another in the original text. All the stories are linked to the arrival of a group of pilgrims at Canterbury, among whom is the poet Geoffrey Chaucer, played by Pasolini himself.\n\nFirst Tale (The Merchant's Tale).\nThe elderly merchant Sir January decides to marry May, a young woman who has little interest in him. After they are married, the merchant suddenly becomes blind, and insists on constantly holding on to his wife' wrist as consolation for the fact that he cannot see her. While the two are walking in the January's private garden, May asks to eat mulberries from one of the trees. Taking advantage of her husband's blindness, she meets with her lover inside of the tree, but is thwarted when the god Pluto, who has been watching over the couple in the garden, suddenly restores January's sight. January briefly sees May and her lover together, but she convinces him that he has hallucinated.\n\nSecond Tale (The Friar's Tale).\nA vendor witnesses two different men committing sodomy, both of whom are caught in the act. While one man manages to escape persecution by bribing the authorities, the other is sentenced to burn on a \"griddle\". During his execution, the vendor walks through the crowd selling griddle cakes. Afterwards, the vendor meets a summoner, and after the two vow to be friends, the vendor reveals himself to be the devil. The summoner then explains that he must collect money from a miserly old woman. When they meet the old woman, the summoner levies false charges against the old woman and tells her that she must appear before the ecclesiastical court, but says that if she pays him a bribe in the amount she owes, she will be excused. The old woman accuses him of lying, and curses him to be taken away by the devil if he does not repent. The summoner refuses, and the devil proceeds to take him to hell.\n\nThird Tale (The Cook's Tale).\nPerkin, a Chaplin-esque fool who carries a cane and wears a hat resembling a bowler, finds work polishing eggs. While his employer is away, Perkin is distracted by a group of men playing a dice game nearby, and joins them. He is soon discovered and fired. Perkin accompanies one of the men home, where he shares a bed with the man and his wife, who is a prostitute. Two police officers who Perkin evaded earlier discover him there, and Perkin is arrested and put in the stocks.\n\nFourth Tale (The Miller's Tale)\nNicholas, a young student, seduces Alison, the wife of a carpenter. In order to deceive the carpenter, Nicholas convinces him that a massive flood is about to occur, and claims that he, the carpenter, and Allison should all three wait in buckets tied to the ceiling rafters to escape drowning. While the carpenter waits in his bucket, Nicholas and Allison sneak away to have sex. Meanwhile, a youth named Absolon who has been flirting with Alison arrives asking for a kiss. Allison answers him by inviting him to climb up to her window and then farting in his face. Absolon runs to a blacksmith's shop where he borrows a hot poker, then returns to the carpenter's house and asks for another kiss. On this occasion, Nicholas goes to the window instead of Alison, and has his buttocks scalded. Nicholas then cries out for water, leading the carpenter to believe that the flood has arrived. The carpenter then cuts the rope holding his bucket in the air, and violently falls to the ground.\n\nFifth Tale (The Wife of Bath's Prologue).\nIn Bath, a middle-aged woman's fourth husband falls ill during sex and dies soon after. The wife quickly decides to marry a young student, literally running from her late husband's funeral in one wing of a cathedral to her wedding in another wing. On their wedding night, the wife of Bath's fifth husband reads to her from a book denouncing the evils of women. The wife of Bath demands that he not tell her about her own business, and destroys the book. Her husband pushes her away, and she falls onto her back and moans on the floor. When he leans over to comfort her, however, she bites his nose. This episode is derived from the prologue to the Wife of Bath's Tale rather than the tale itself.\n\nSixth Tale (The Reeve's Tale).\nIn Cambridge, two students (Alan and John) bring a sack of grain to a mill to be milled into flour. Simkin the miller tricks the youths by freeing their horse and switching their flour for bran while they chase after it. When they return with the horse, it is late in the evening, and the students ask to stay the night. The miller agrees to let them stay, and the two share a pallet bed next to one shared by the miller and his wife. During the night, one of the students seduces Molly, the miller's daughter, being careful not to wake the Miller. The miller's wife, meanwhile, gets up to urinate, and stumbles over the crib at the foot of her and the miller's pallet. Before she returns, the other student moves the crib to the foot of his own pallet, tricking the miller's wife into sleeping with him instead of the miller. The first student finishes having sex with Molly, and she confesses that she and father have stolen his flour. The student then gets into bed with the miller and tells him about his exploits with Molly, thinking that the miller is his companion.\n\nSeventh Tale (The Pardoner's Tale).\nRufus, one of a group of four young men is killed by a thief, spurning the others to seek out Death for themselves. The youths then encounter an old man, who they accuse of conspiring with Death in order to kill the young, and demand at knifepoint that they tell him where Death is located. The old man tells them to look around a nearby oak tree, where they find instead an abundance of treasure. While two of the youths wait by the treasure, a third (Dick the Sparrow) leaves for town, returning later with three casks of wine, two of which he has poisoned. When he reaches the tree, the two youths drink the poisoned wine and stab their companion, then succumb to the poison.\n\nEighth Tale (The Summoner's Tale).\nIn the final tale, a gluttonous friar tries to extract as many donations as possible from a bedridden parishioner. The parishioner then offers him his most valuable possession, provided he promises to distribute it equally among all the friars. The parishioner claims that this possession is located beneath his buttocks. When the friar reaches down to retrieve the item, the bedridden man farts into his hands. That night, an angel visits the friar and brings him to hell, where Satan expels hundreds of corrupt friars from his rectum.\n\nThe film ends with the pilgrims arriving at the Canterbury Cathedral, and Chaucer at home writing the words \"Qui finiscono i racconti di Canterbury, narrati solo per il piacere di raccontarli. Amen,\" meaning \"Here ends the Canterbury Tales, told only for the pleasure of telling them. Amen:\" a phrase that appears nowhere in the original \"Canterbury Tales\".\n\n\n\nThe following locations were used as settings for the tales:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2119026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2119026", "title": "Purana Qila", "text": "Purana Qila\n\nPurana Qila, Hindustani for Old Fort also formerly called Shergarh & Sher Fort is one of the oldest forts in Delhi, India. The site has been continuously inhabited for 2,500 years and remains dating from the pre-Mauryan period have been found. The present citadel was begun in the time of Humayun and its construction continued under Sher Shah Suri. The site is often identified with the site of Indraprastha, the capital of the kingdoms of the Pandavas from the Mahabharata.\n\nExcavations point to traces from the 3rd century BC, the pre-Mauryan period. The first two rounds of excavations – in 1954–55 and 1969–72 – by BB Lal, then director of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), had unearthed traces of Painted Grey Ware culture (PGW) under the mound. At the time, Lal had embarked on a mission to excavate various sites mentioned in the Mahabharata text and had found such traces as a common feature at all those sites. On the basis of traces of the PGW, Lal concluded that it was the site of the Pandava kingdom of Indraprastha, estimating 900 BCE as the period of the Kurukshetra war. Later on, excavation conducted by Dr. Vasant Kumar Swarnkar, Superintending Archaeologist of the Archaeological Survey of India during 2013-14 and 2017-18 confirms that the site of Purana Qila has a continuous habitation from Pre-Maurya era to British era. Swarnkar has stated that they have not found the PGW in a stratified layer which will attest to the presence of its culture. Alexander Cunningham identified the fort with that of Indraprastha, though he referred to the present structure as built by Muslims.\n\nThe origins of the Purana Qila lie in the walls of Dinpanah, the new city of Delhi being constructed by Mughal emperor Humayun. Abul Fazl states that he built the fort in the place of that of ancient Indraprastha. The founder of the Suri Dynasty, Sher Shah Suri, defeated Humayun and made changes to the fort, strengthening its fortifications and completing its walls. He also had another fort built there called \"Shergarh\", where the governor resided. His project, however, was a continuation of Humayun's construction of a citadel for a royal city. He also built many structures inside the fort. Additions to the fort have been believed to have been made even after his rule. The extent of his contribution to the fort's construction is disputed. The historical attribution of its construction is also uncertain judging from primary sources. Muhammad Khwandamir said that Humayun laid the foundation of the city on a mound near Yamuna. The construction of the walls and fortifications were almost finished by Humayun's time. Tarikh-i-Da'udi states that Sher Shah Suri's royal city remained incomplete upon his death and he had named his fort Shergarh. Abbas Sarwani states the two forts being constructed by him were incomplete when he died. Tarikh-i-Khan-Jahan states that Salim Shah Suri had constructed a wall defending Dinpanah of Humayun.\n\nPurana Qila and its environs flourished as the \"sixth city of Delhi\".\nIn the year 1556, on 7th October Hindu king Hem Chandra Vikramaditya was crowned in Purana Quila, who had defeated Akbar's forces decisively at Battle of Delhi (1556).\nEdwin Lutyens who designed the new capital of British India, New Delhi, in the 1920s, had aligned the central vista, now Rajpath, with Purana Qila. During the Partition of India, in August 1947 the Purana Qila along with the neighbouring Humayun's Tomb, became the site for refuge camps for Muslims migrating to newly founded Pakistan. This included over 12,000 government employees who had opted for service in Pakistan, and between 150,000–200,000 Muslim refugees, who swarmed inside Purana Qila by September 1947, when Indian government took over the management of the two camps. The Purana Qila camp remained functional until early 1948, as the trains to Pakistan waited until October 1947 to start.\n\nIn the 1970s, the ramparts of Purana Qila were first used as a backdrop for theatre, when three productions of the National School of Drama were staged here: \"Tughlaq\", \"Andha Yug\" and \"Sultan Razia\", directed by Ebrahim Alkazi. In later decades it has been the venue of various important theatre productions, cultural events, and concerts. Today, it is the venue of a daily sound and light presentation after sunset, on the history of the \"Seven Cities of Delhi\", from Indraprastha through New Delhi.\n\nDelhi is thought by some to be located at the site of the legendary city of Indraprastha founded by the Pandavas from \"Mahabharata\" period, which is consequently considered the 'First City of Delhi'. Until 1913, a village called \"Indrapat\" existed within the fort walls.\n\nThe normal visiting hours are from 7:00 A.M. to 5:00 pm.\n\nArchaeological Survey of India (ASI) carried out excavations at Purana Qila in 1954–55 and again from 1969 to 1973 by B. B. Lal, and in 2013-14 & 2017-18 by Vasant Kumar Swarnkar. its findings and artefacts are exhibited at the Archaeological Museum, Purana Qila. This includes Painted Grey Ware, dating 1000 BC, and various objects and pottery signifying continuous habitation from Mauryan to Shunga, Kushana, Gupta, Rajput, Delhi Sultanate and Mughal periods. The homes built during the Rajput era were built of bricks used in other structures and also mud bricks. A fortification wall about 30 metre long was also found. During the Delhi Suntanate, structures were made from re-used bricks and over the ruins of earlier structures. The Mughal era structures were characterized by a deep pit dug over those of the preceding eras.\n\nThe walls of the Fort rise to a height of 18 metres, traverse about 1.5 km, and have three arched gateways: the \"Bara Darwaza\" (Big Gate) facing west, which is still in use today; the south gate, also popularly known as the 'Humayun Gate' (probably so known because it was constructed by Humayun, or perhaps because Humayun's Tomb is visible from there); and lastly, the 'Talaqi Gate', often known as the \"forbidden gate\". All the gates are double-storeyed sandstone structures flanked by two huge semi-circular bastion towers, decorated with white and coloured-marble inlays and blue tiles. They are replete with detailing, including ornate overhanging balconies, or \"jharokhas\", and are topped by pillared pavilions (\"chhatris\"), all features that are reminiscent of Rajasthani architecture as seen in the North and South Gates, and which were amply repeated in future Mughal architecture. Despite the grandeurs of the exterior, few of interior structures have survived except the Qila-i Kuhna Mosque and the Shermandal, both credited to Sher Shah.\n\nThe single-domed \"Qila-i-Kuna Mosque\", built by Sher Shah in 1541 is an excellent example of a pre-Mughal design, and an early example of the extensive use of the pointed arch in the region as seen in its five doorways with the 'true' horseshoe-shaped arches. It was designed as a Jami Mosque, or Friday mosque for the Sultan and his courtiers. The prayer hall inside, the single-aisled mosque, measures 51.20m by 14.90m and has five elegant arched prayer niches or \"mihrabs\" set in its western wall. Marble in shades of red, white and slate is used for the calligraphic inscriptions on the central iwan, marks a transition from Lodhi to Mughal architecture. At one time, the courtyard had a shallow tank, with a fountain.\n\nA second storey, accessed through staircases from the prayer hall, with a narrow passage running along the rectangular hall, provided space for female courtiers to pray, while the arched doorway on the left wall, framed by ornate \"jharokas\", was reserved for members of the royal family. On a marble slab within the mosque an inscription reads: \"As long as there are people on the earth, may this edifice be frequented and people be happy and cheerful in it\". Today it is the best preserved building in Purana Qila.\n\nThe \"Sher Mandal\" named for Farid (Sher Shah) who had tried to finish what was ordered by Babur but had died during the initial phase and so construction was halted until the arrival of Humayun.\n\nThis double-storeyed octagonal tower of red sandstone with steep stairs leading up to the roof was intended to be higher than its existing height. Its original builder was Babur who ordered the construction and was used as a personal observatory and library for his son Humayun, finished only after he recaptured the fort. It is also one of the first observatories of Delhi, the earliest being in Pir Ghaib at Hindu Rao at Ridge built in the 14th century by Firoz Shah Tughlaq. The tower is topped by an octagonal \"chhatri\" supported by eight pillars and decorated with white marble in typical Mughal style.\n\nInside, there are remnants of the decorative plaster-work and traces of stone-shelving where, presumably, the emperor's books were placed.\n\nThis was also the spot where, on 24 January 1556 Humayun fell from the second floor to his death. He slipped while hastening to the evening prayers, following his hobby of astronomical star gazing at the top of this private observatory. He fell headlong down the stairs and died of his injuries two days later. Entry inside the library is now prohibited.\n\nSeveral other monuments lie around the complex, like Kairul Manzil, mosque built by Maham Anga, Akbar's foster-mother, and which was later used as a madarsa. Sher Shah Suri Gate or \"Lal Darwaza\", which was the southern gate to Shergarh, also lies opposite the Purana Qila complex, across Mathura Road, south-east of the Kairul Manzil.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2119028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2119028", "title": "Pyay", "text": "Pyay\n\nPyay (, ; , ; also known as Prome and Pyè) is principal town of Pyay Township in the Bago Region in Myanmar. Pyay is located on the bank of the Irrawaddy River, north-west of Yangon. It is an important trade center for the Ayeyarwady Delta, Central and Upper Myanmar and the Rakhine (Arakan) State. The British Irrawaddy Flotilla Company established the current town in the late 19th century on the Irrawaddy as a transshipment point for cargo between Upper and Lower Burma.\n\nThe district of Pyay encompasses the valley of the Irrawaddy, located between Thayetmyo, Hinthada and Tharrawaddy districts. Along the western side of Pyay District are the Arakan Mountains and along the eastern side are the Pegu Range. Pyay District's main towns are Pyay, Shwe Taung, and Paungde.\n\nThe name \"Pyay\" means \"country\" in Burmese, and refers to the ruins of the main city of the Pyu city-states, Sri Ksetra (, Sanskrit \"Śrīkṣetra\" \"blessed place, country\"), which is located to the south-east of modern Pyay and is in the village of Hmawa.\n\nMuch debate surrounds the construction of Sri Ksetra. Htin Aung suggests that Pyu might have been founded in 78 CE, based on the Sanskrit / Pyu Era. D. G. E. Hall and Gordon Luce, however, claim that civilisation of the Irrawaddy Valley could not have been possible before the 4th century, thus, attributing the founding of Sri Ksetra to 638, from which the current Burmese Kawza Era begins.\n\nSri Ksetra was the capital of the Pyu dynasty of Vikrama. The city was circular with walls enclosing about , making it the largest walled city in Southeast Asia during its peak. The city contained both housing and farms, as is evident from the remains of waterways and tanks which have been discovered.\n\nThe Chinese pilgrims Xuanzang and Yijing mentioned Sri Ksetra in their mid-7th-century accounts. It is not known when precisely the Pyu abandoned Sri Ksetra and moved northward. It is speculated that their decline was due to the growth of the Irrawaddy river delta, cutting it off from coastal trade, and also from Mon and later Tai Shan incursions. Burmese chronicles state that when Anawrahta invaded the southern parts of modern-day Myanmar in 1057, he ordered the ruins of Sri Ksetra to be destroyed to prevent rebels from sheltering there. The Burmese came to call the old Pyu center Pyi. The extensive ruins have been the subject of intensive archaeological investigation.\nCalled Prome by the British (after the name that appears in the Portuguese texts of the XVIIth century), the city became part of British territory after the Second Anglo-Burmese War in 1853. The town was taken by the British in 1825 during the Battle of Prome and again in 1852, on both occasions with hardly any opposition. In 1862, it was almost entirely destroyed by fire, and was afterwards relaid out in straight and broad streets. It was erected into a municipality in 1874, and since then great improvements have been made, including waterworks.\nDuring World War II the city was the site of the Battle of Prome. The city was later retaken by the British Army in May 1945.\nTo the south and south-east, the town is closed in by low pagoda-topped hills, on one of which stands the conspicuous gilded Shwesandaw Pagoda. The Shwesandaw Pagoda is a pagoda in the center of Pyay. It is the terminus for a railway from Yangon, which runs through the district.\n\nTo the west of Pyay, crossing Irrawaddy river through Nawaday bridge, stands the Shwebontha Muni Pagoda. The Buddha statue is one of three replica of the Maha Myat Muni Buddha statue, believe to date back 554 B.C. when the king Sandar Thuriy rules.\n\nThe north and north-east of the district is forest-covered, and contains numerous valleys and ravines, which unite in one large stream called the Naweng River. The most important of the plains lie in the south and south-west portions of Pyay, and extend along the whole length of the railway that runs between. There are, in addition large tracts of land covered by jungle, which are available for cultivation. The principal river is the Irrawaddy, which intersects the district from north to south; next in importance are the Thani and its tributaries and the Naweng system of rivers. In the hills near the capital the soil is of Tertiary formation, and in the plains it is an alluvial deposit.\n\nPyay has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification \"Aw\"). Temperatures are hot throughout the year, especially in the months before the monsoon from March to May when average maximum temperatures exceed . The winter months (December–February) are somewhat milder than the rest of the year. There is a winter dry season (December–April) and a summer wet season (May–November). Heavy rain falls in the summer, particularly in the month of July when of rain falls.\n\nThe main crop is rice, but some cotton and tobacco are grown, while the custard apples are famous. Sericulture is extensively carried on by a special class. The forests yield teak and cutch, cotton and silk-weaving are important industries; there are also manufactures of ornamental boxes, coarse brown sugar and cutch.\n\nPyay City has three universities. The universities are Pyay University (PU), Pyay Technological University (PTU), and Computer University, Pyay. Pyay University is situated near to the town centre of Pyay. PTU, which is one of the best ranking University in Myanmar, is situated near to Hnawgone village and Latkhoukpin village, a few miles away from Pyay.

He is a convert to Islam and has a second family in Fez, Morocco. \nJohn Kingerlee was born in Birmingham, England in 1936. His Mother was related to Hogan's from County Cork and he was educated in a school run by the Marist Fathers. After living for twenty years in Cornwall in the far southwest of Britain, he moved in 1982 to an isolated farmhouse on the Beara Peninsula in West Cork, Ireland.\n\nOn the isolated Beara peninsula, looking directly out from his home across Kenmare Bay to the ring of Kerry, John and his wife Mo lead a life which some might describe as lonely. However, what they lack in human contact they make up for through an existence which extends to growing their own vegetables in their organic garden. The Kingerlees' alternative outlook on life somehow seems to be in complete harmony both with the space they inhabit and with the art that flows from John's palette knife and brush.\n\nA non-conformist at heart, John has turned his back on the traditional way of seeing and depicting landscape - as a series of parallel planes that are made to appear to recede from foreground to background by the artist's manipulation of linear and aerial perspective. Recognising that perspective itself is a mathematical construct, John takes a different approach that is as radical as it is original. He states that he wants his art to recreate the experience of being in and moving through the landscape.\nIn the studio, using his own made-up pigments, he mimics the cycle of growth and decay by working with matter in a very direct and hands-on way. He applies colours, deep pools of it, red brick, reds, molten silver and zinc, platinum and titanium, sulphuric yellows and so much more to dozens of paintings in various states of becoming. He paints standing up, applying a new layer of paint (finished paintings will comprise fifty to one hundred or more layers of paint applied over a period of several years and when completed can take up to five months to dry out). His preferred tools are palette knives (one in each hand is the norm), and a decorator's brush which he holds vertically using a stippling technique.\n\nKingerlee has exhibited works in Ireland, England and The United States of America. Art critic William Zimmer gave a speech about the artist and his works at the Los Angeles exhibition in October 2006, curated by Masoud Pourhabib.

The film is based on a partly true, partly fictionalized story of a successful Afghan-Canadian, played by Nelofer Pazira, who returns to Afghanistan after receiving a letter from Dyana, her lifelong girl friend who was left behind when the family escaped, that she plans on committing suicide on the last solar eclipse of the millennium.\n\n\"Kandahar\" was filmed mostly in Iran, including at the Niatak refugee camp, but also secretly in Afghanistan itself.

After the September 11 attacks, however, it was widely shown. \"Kandahar\" won Makhmalbaf the Federico Fellini Prize from UNESCO in 2001, and is one of the \"All-Time\" 100 Movies by the periodical \"Time\".\n\nNafas, an Afghan woman living in safety in Canada, arrives in Iran, dons a burqa, and enters Afghanistan posing as a wife in a family of refugees attempting to return to their homeland. Brigands rob them along the road to Kandahar. They decide to return to Iran, but Nafas must continue on her mission to save her maimed sister from suicide. She pays Khak, a boy recently expelled from a Qur'anic school, to be her guide. Khak brings Nafas to a village doctor when she gets sick from drinking unsanitized well water. The doctor reveals himself to be an African American convert to Islam, who must wear a fake beard (which he calls \"a man's burqa\") because he can't grow one. Out of fear of being found out, Khak is dismissed, and the doctor takes Nafas by horse cart. Along the way, he confides with her that he has no formal medical training and has become disillusioned with the turn the country has taken under the Taliban.\n\nAlong her journey, Nafas records her impressions into a portable tape recorder in a country where the only technological progress allowed is weaponry. Nafas learns more and more about the hardships women face; and even more so, how years of war have destroyed Afghan society. She sees children robbing corpses to survive, people fighting over artificial limbs that they might need in case they walk through a minefield, and doctors who examine female patients from behind a curtain with a hole in it.\n\nWhen the doctor turns back because he is afraid to enter Kandahar, she follows a man wearing a burqa who scammed a pair of artificial legs out of the Red Cross. The pair join a wedding party which is stopped by the Taliban because they are singing and playing instruments which is forbidden by law. Her guide is unveiled and taken away. Nafas is cleared by the Taliban patrol to continue, along with other members of the wedding party. In the end, Nafas is within sight of Kandahar at sunset, but she is now a prisoner of the veil.\n\nThe film stars Dawud Salahuddin (credited in the film as Hassan Tantai), an American-born convert to Islam who in 1980 assassinated an Iranian dissident and ex-diplomat at the behest of the newly formed Islamic Republic of Iran's intelligence authorities. Makhmalbaf stated that Salahuddin \"is also a victim - a victim of the ideal he believed in. His humanity, when he opened fire against his ideological enemy, was martyred by his idealism.\"\n\n"}

He also played five Twenty20 Internationals between 2006 and 2010. Hinds is currently the president of the West Indies Players' Association (WIPA), a role he has held since 2012.\n\nHinds made his Test debut against Zimbabwe in 2000. In just his fourth Test Match he scored 165 against Pakistan.\n\nOften criticised for his lack of footwork, Hinds was a surprise choice as opener for the last Test of what had been a disastrous tour of Australia in 2000–01. Batting with Sherwin Campbell, the pair made opening stands of 147 and 98. He was however dropped from the side soon after and replaced by Chris Gayle who went on to cement his spot at the top of the order. During an ODI series in England in 2004 he was brought back into the side, again as opener because the West Indies were struggling to find a solid pair at the top of the order. For the next few years he formed a fairly successful opening partnership with Gayle. In Tests they put on 1300 runs together at 39.39 in 33 innings. Their ODI opening partnership saw them make 1687 runs at 41.15.\n\nIn 2003 he made successive ODI hundreds against Australia at Grenada, both unbeaten and both in victories for the West Indies.\n\nHis highest Test score of 213 was made against South Africa at Georgetown in 2005 and included 34 fours and 2 sixes. He put on 284 for the 4th wicket with Shivnarine Chanderpaul who also made a double hundred making it one of the few occasions where two players have passed 200 in the same innings. Hinds however struggled soon after and again found himself on the sidelines. He made a brief return to the side in May for an ODI series against India but failed to impress and lost any chance he had of gaining inclusion in the World Cup squad.\n\nHe has not played Test cricket since 2005, and his last One Day International appearance was in 2006 and in October 2007, he signed a one-year contract to play as a Kolpak player for English county side Derbyshire in the 2008 season.\n\nHe played in the Indian Cricket League for the Ahmedabad Rockets in the first half of 2008, although he did not return in season 2.\n\n"}

Written and oral history and his writings suggest that he had a Jewish background. However, it has also been argued by other historians that he was a Muslim of Jewish background, and Bernard Lewis states: \"There is some uncertainty to whether he was a professing Jew or a Muslim of Jewish origin.\"\n\nIn 961–62 he travelled in Western and Central Europe and in Italy at least as far as Rome, where he was received with an audience with the Holy Roman Emperor Otto I during the first week of February.\n\nNothing is known about his return to al-Andalus (the Muslim-ruled part of the Iberian Peninsula), nor of any further travel. The memoirs and commentaries of his journey, possibly first presented to the Cordoban caliph Al-Hakam II (961–76), have been lost; only excerpts by later authors have been preserved, principally Abu Abdullah al-Bakri's \"Book of Highways and of Kingdoms\" and the work of Zakariya al-Qazwini, possibly via the writings of Al-Udri.\n\nHis work is widely known as providing the first reliable description of the Polish state under Mieszko I, the first historical ruler of Poland.

It is nicknamed the 'Leaning Tower of China'.\n\nThe primary pagoda of the former Yunyan Temple, which was founded in 327 and rebuilt for the last time in 1871. The temple suffered damage in successive wars and most of the temple was destroyed during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Some elements of the temple such as the formal entrance, the Yunyan Pagoda, and several other buildings and smaller shrines have survived, and now stand as landmarks throughout Tiger Hill Park. \n\nConstruction of the pagoda began in 907 CE, during the later period of the Five Dynasties period, at a time when Suzhou was ruled by the Wuyue Kingdom. Construction was completed in 961 CE during the Song Dynasty. \n\nThe uppermost stories of the pagoda were built as an addition during the reign of the Chongzhen Emperor (1628–1644), the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty.\n\nThe Yunyan Pagoda rises to a height of 47 m (154 ft). The pagoda has seven stories and is octagonal in plan, and was built with a masonry structure designed to imitate wooden-structured pagodas prevalent at the time. \n\nIn more than a thousand years the pagoda has gradually slanted due to forces of nature. Now the top and bottom of the tower vary by 2.32 meters. The entire structure weighs some , supported by internal brick columns. However, the pagoda leans roughly 3 degrees due to the cracking of two supporting columns.\n\nThe pagoda leans because the foundation is originally half rock and the other half is on soil. In 1957, efforts were made to stabilize the pagoda and prevent further leaning. Concrete was also pumped into the soil forming a stronger foundation. \n\nDuring the reinforcement process, a stone casket containing Buddhist scriptures was found. The container had an inscription noting the completion date of the pagoda as the seventeenth day of the twelfth month of the second year of the Jianlong era (961 CE).\n\nThe Yunyan Pagoda is a designated Major National Historical and Cultural Site in Jiangsu.

She was known for her slender figure and her disproportionately large breasts. She has family roots in Taishan, Guangdong.. She is the namesake of boba.\n\nAmy Yip is best known for her roles in Hong Kong Category III films such as \"Sex and Zen\" and \"Erotic Ghost Story\". The movie \"Sex and Zen\" is also the highest grossing Category III movie in the history of Hong Kong box office.\n\nYip first came to notice by appearing in various television series' in the mid-1980s. \"Erotic Ghost Story\" in 1987 proved to be a breakthrough role and she became one of the most popular actresses in Hong Kong and many other parts of Asia in the late 1980s and early 1990s. She had large, full breasts which made her much in demand for nude scenes. However she refused to appear fully naked on film. Her efforts to avoid fully exposing her breasts on screen through clever use of camera angles, whereby the side of her breast is seen, became known as the \"Yip tease\". However, in Erotic Ghost Story for example, she did show her buttocks in one scene.\n\nShe retired from acting in 1997. She expressed regret that, given the nature of her films, there were not many memorable roles during her acting career. The only exceptional movie for her was the 1991 movie \"Queen of the Underworld\" which she portrayed Sister Har, a woman who climbed from the lowest depths of society to become the celebrated queen of the night life in the 1960s and 1970s of Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1990, a Hong Kong man was sent to prison and charged for stealing money. This man said he stole money in order to sustain Amy Yip's luxurious lifestyle. However, Amy Yip said she had only met the man few times and the man was not a close friend.\n\nNumerous rumours have surfaced over the years about Yip being married to her long term orthopedics surgeon-boyfriend Lim Kiam Hwee, and being pregnant. In an interview in early 2006 with an \"East Weekly\" reporter, who spotted Yip walking her dog at Repulse Bay, however, she said she was in a steady relationship with her boyfriend of more than 15 years and had no intention of getting married or having children. She added she had food and beverage businesses set up in Hong Kong and Macau that kept her busy and occupied.\n\nWhen asked if she would consider a comeback into the film business, Yip flatly rejected the idea, saying that she was very happy with her carefree lifestyle and had no desire of returning to filming long hours and traveling intensively for movies and record publicity. She also said that she is content with not showing her breasts to make a living.\n\nIn May 2018 the first English language book of her career in movies and television was released on Amazon, called \"The Movies of Amy Yip\" by Chaz Gower ().\n\n\nOne of the nicknames for her, boba (which means \"champion of breasts\"), was adopted the name of the tapioca pearls in Taiwanese bubble tea during the 1980s.\n\n"}

Often it is used together with fluorouracil and folinic acid (leucovorin) in advanced cancer. It is given by injection into a vein.\nCommon side effects include numbness, feeling tired, nausea, diarrhea, and low blood cell counts. Other serious side effects include allergic reactions. Use in pregnancy is known to harm the baby. Oxaliplatin is in the platinum-based antineoplastic family of medications. It is believed to work by blocking the duplication of DNA.\nOxaliplatin was patented in 1976 and approved for medical use in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is 8.74 to 125.43 USD a vial. In the United Kingdom it costs the NHS 299.50 pounds per 100 mg dose.\n\nOxaliplatin is used for treatment of colorectal cancer, typically along with folinic acid and 5-fluorouracil in a combination known as FOLFOX. Oxaliplatin has been compared with other platinum compounds used for advanced cancers, such as cisplatin and carboplatin.\n\nOxaliplatin by itself has modest activity against advanced colorectal cancer. When compared with just 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid administered according to the de Gramont regimen, a FOLFOX4 regime produced no significant increase in overall survival, but did produce an improvement in progression-free survival, the primary end-point of the phase III randomized trial.\n\nAfter and/or before the curative resection of colorectal cancer, chemotherapy based on 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid reduces the risk of relapse. The benefit is clinically relevant when cancer has spread to locoregional lymph nodes or penetrated through the wall of the rectum or colon (stage III, Dukes C). The addition of oxaliplatin improves relapse-free survival, but data on overall survival have not yet been published \"in extenso\".\n\nSide-effects of oxaliplatin treatment can potentially include:\n\nIn addition, some patients may experience an allergic reaction to platinum-containing drugs. This is more common in women.\n\nOxaliplatin has less ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity than cisplatin and carboplatin.\n\nThe compound features a square planar platinum(II) center. In contrast to cisplatin and carboplatin, oxaliplatin features the bidentate ligand 1,2-diaminocyclohexane in place of the two monodentate ammine ligands. It also features a bidentate oxalate group. The three-dimensional structure of the molecule has been elucidated by X-ray crystallography, although the presence of pseudosymmetry in the crystal structure has caused confusion in its interpretation.\n\nAccording to in vivo studies, oxaliplatin fights carcinoma of the colon through non-targeted cytotoxic effects. Like other platinum compounds, its cytotoxicity is thought to result from inhibition of DNA synthesis in cells. In particular, oxaliplatin forms both inter- and intra-strand cross links in DNA, which prevent DNA replication and transcription, causing cell death.\n\nOxaliplatin was discovered in 1976 at Nagoya City University by Professor Yoshinori Kidani, who was granted U.S. Patent 4,169,846 in 1979. Oxaliplatin was subsequently in-licensed by Debiopharm and developed as an advanced colorectal cancer treatment. Debiopharm licensed the drug to Sanofi-Aventis in 1994. It gained European approval in 1996 (initially in France) and approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2002. Generic oxaliplatin was first approved in the United States in August 2009. Patent disputes caused generic production to stop in 2010, but it restarted in 2012.\n\nEloxatin is covered by patent numbers 5338874 (Expiry Apr 07,2013), 5420319 (Expiry Aug 08,2016), 5716988 (Expiry Aug 07,2015) and 5290961 (Expiry Jan 12, 2013) (see Electronic Orange Book patent info for Eloxatin). Exclusivity code I-441, which expired on Nov 04, 2007, is for use combination with infusional 5-FU/LV for adjuvant treatment stage III colon cancer patients who have undergone complete resection primary tumor-based on improvement in disease free survival with no demonstrated benefit overall survival after 4 years.

It was formerly known as Squires Gate Airport and Blackpool International Airport.\n\nOwnership of the airport has changed a number of times over the years. The airport was wholly owned by Blackpool Borough Council until 2004, when it was sold to a consortium led by Wolverhampton Airport operators City Hopper Ltd (CHAL), who operated it until May 2008 when Balfour Beatty purchased MAR Property's 95% stake. Blackpool Borough Council retained 5%. During 2014 Balfour Beatty claimed to be looking for a buyer for the airport, and then after just one month announced that it was to close the Airport. On 15 October 2014, the airport's terminal and Air Traffic Control provision was closed, with the last scheduled flights to Dublin and the Isle of Man leaving in the late afternoon. In November 2014, the former company formed a new company, called Squires Gate Airport Operations Ltd, and the airport reopened once again in December 2014 for non-commercial operations.\n\nExecutive flights are operated by Hangar 3 Blackpool Ltd and UK Aviation Services (formerly J-Max), which offer access to a private aircraft hangar and private aircraft management. Babcock Mission Critical Services Offshore operate helicopter services to the offshore oil and gas facilities in the Irish Sea, using two Eurocopter AS365N3 Dauphin helicopters from a purpose built helicopter terminal facility. Blackpool Airport is also home to the North West Air Ambulance service operated by a twin-engined Eurocopter EC135. There are many other companies situated on the airfield which offer flying lessons, training and maintenance facilities.\n\nBlackpool Airport Limited has a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P724) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction. Passenger numbers peaked in 2007, with over 550,000 passing through the airport, but had fallen to 235,238 in 2012. In 2014, the last year of commercial operations, the airport handled 223,372 passengers, a drop of 15% compared to the 2013 stats; this is due to the stats running from 1 January until the closure of the airport on 15 October.\n\nThe airport site's first aviation use was in October 1909, when the UK's first official public Flying Meeting was held on a specially laid out site at Squires Gate, followed by another in 1910. By 1911 the site had become a racecourse, and it was used as a military hospital during the First World War and until 1924. Flights from the site resumed in the early 1930s. Small UK airlines used the airfield during the mid-1930s. Railway Air Services commenced schedules to Blackpool from 15 April 1935, linking the airport with the Isle of Man, Manchester and Liverpool. Connections could be made at the two cities to London and the south and west of England. In June 1937, airline operations were transferred to Stanley Park Aerodrome. The sister of aviation pioneer Amy Johnson lived in Stanley Park, resulting in her often paying a visit; Johnson's last complete flight was a ferry flight for the ATA from Squires Gate to Oxford.\n\nWork on enlarging and improving the airfield and facilities began in late 1937, but the aerodrome was requisitioned by the Air Ministry in 1938. Three bituminous runways were laid to support operations, with squadrons stationed at RAF Squires Gate during the Second World War including:\n\nRAF Coastal Command also established an operational base on site, and expanded RAF Warton to act as a satellite airfield.\n\nThe RAF also selected Blackpool as one of its training wings due to the availability of accommodation. Training was based between Squires Gate and the British Army camps at Weeton and Kirkham, utilising the large number of guest houses, plus the beaches, pier, and the Winter Gardens for exercising; 769,673 recruits received their basic training at Blackpool. The RAF also established two specialist training schools:\n\nThe Ministry of Aircraft Production erected a shadow aircraft factory during 1939-1940 in the north-east corner of the airfield to enable Vickers-Armstrong to operate an aircraft production facility at Squires Gate. This produced 2,584 Wellington medium bombers, several hundred of which were assembled and flown from Stanley Park Aerodrome before landing at Squires Gate for testing and delivery. The first was completed in September 1940 and the last in October 1945, when the factory closed.\n\nThe factory was reopened by Hawker Aircraft in the mid-1950s to augment the production of Hawker Hunter jet fighters, under contract SP/6ACFT/9817/CB 7a. Many Hunters were also built for the Swedish Air Force.\n\nScheduled flights were resumed by Isle of Man Air Services in summer 1946. Lancashire Aircraft Corporation and other private airlines established their bases at the airport from 1946 onwards. By 1949, the airfield was controlled by the Ministry of Civil Aviation and renamed Blackpool Airport.\n\nPrior to 2004, when the airport was sold to City Hopper Airports Limited, the airport was owned and operated by Blackpool Borough Council, who were losing £1 million per year before the £13 million sale.\n\nSpeaking about the sale, Julian Kearsley, strategic director of business services at the town hall, who helped broker the deal, said: \"The airport is a key element in terms of developing the new Blackpool. It is not as if the council has sold off the family silver and lost any role in this. We wish to see the terminal continue as an airport as part of our ambitious plans for revitalising the whole area. This deal will see more jobs, it will save the council money and it protects the employment of people already there.\"\n\nCoun Roy Fisher, leader of Blackpool Council, said: \"The sale of Blackpool Airport once agreed will be great news for everyone in Blackpool.\"\n\nCoun Robert Wynne, portfolio holder for partnerships, business and companies, added: \"A year ago the council set itself specific targets with regard to Blackpool Airport: we wanted more flights, particularly those that brought people to the town, we wanted more quality jobs and we wanted a better deal for the council taxpayer. This agreement fulfils all those objectives. We will end up with a much better and busier airport at no cost whatsoever to the council taxpayer.\"\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the airport steadily expanded, accommodating further helicopter operations for British Gas and attracting scheduled flights from budget airlines Jet2 and Ryanair. Since World War II, the airport has also been a centre for private, club, and general aviation.\n\nIn 2005, Jet2 became the first major low cost airline to base an aircraft at Blackpool Airport. This created around 50 new jobs and boosted passenger numbers. It used to serve seven destinations from the airport—five in Spain (Palma, Alicante, Murcia, Tenerife South, Málaga), one in Portugal (Faro), and a domestic service to Belfast.\nAlso in 2005, Monarch set up a new route to Málaga, three times a week. The airline ceased services after a year, blaming low passenger numbers. However, Jet2 had earlier announced that it would be operating flights to Málaga.\n\nUntil January 2006 an Avro Vulcan bomber (registration: XL391) was on static external display close to the entrance to the airport. XL391's last operational role was at Ascension Island during the Falklands Conflict in 1982; however, it only flew as a backup aircraft and never actually went to the Falklands. It was put up for sale in October 2004 on eBay and purchased by Manchester pub landlord Chris Ollerenshaw (for £15,102.03), who had intentions to transport it to his pub and display it in his beer garden. However, after finding out that the condition of the aircraft was so poor that moving it would be extremely challenging and that it would cost over £20,000, in addition to the reported £1000 a week storage charge, Ollerenshaw pulled out of the deal and later relinquished ownership of the plane back to the airport. The Vulcan was then sold on for scrap for £4,800, and was completely removed from the site and scrapped on 12 January 2006.\n\nDuring 2006, British North West Airlines, the smallest airline based at Blackpool, stopped trading for both charter and scheduled flights. Flights to the Isle of Man were taken over by Citywing up to three times a day, with an onward connection to Belfast City. Citywing brought low fares to the Isle of Man and Belfast routes and passenger numbers on these route vastly increased in January 2007.\n\nWith the growth of the airport, a new carrier, operating under the name Jetstream Express, introduced flights in 2007 to Belfast City Airport (from May), Aberdeen Airport (from June) and Southampton Airport (from July). The Belfast route was in competition with Jet2, who operated a twice daily service to Northern Ireland. Two Jetstream 31s were based at the airport to support the operation, however, the service ended in June 2007 as the routes had not proved viable.\n\nIn 2007, Jet2 cancelled its Prague and Amsterdam services, blaming insufficient passenger numbers.\n\nThe airport was owned and operated by City Hopper Airports Limited, which also owns Wolverhampton Airport and Biella Airport in Italy, until January 2007, when it was placed under new management after one of its two major shareholders bought out its partner. MAR Properties Ltd agreed terms to take over full control of Blackpool and Wolverhampton Airports. In May 2008, it was announced that Balfour Beatty, who also owned Exeter Airport and Derry Airport, had purchased MAR Property's 95% stake in the airport; the remaining 5% stake was held by Blackpool Borough Council.\n\nOn 6 May 2008, Balfour Beatty bought the 95% stake of the airport off CityHopper Airports Ltd for £14 million. The construction company also owned Exeter Airport.\n\nOn 18 July 2008, the \"Blackpool Gazette\" announced that Jet2 planned to suspend its daily service from Blackpool to Belfast International for the winter. A dip in passenger numbers and the rising price of oil had taken its toll on the service. According to the newspaper, Jet2 would restart the daily Belfast service from March 2009.\n\nIn the summer of 2008 Ryanair announced a large cut in capacity at a number of airports, including Stansted, from October 2008 to March 2009, although Blackpool was not affected by these cuts. However, on 25 November 2008, Ryanair announced the intention to withdraw all flights from 5 January 2009, following the airport's introduction of a £10 per person Airport Development Fee.\n\nAfter the £10 Airport Development Fee was introduced at the start of 2009, a new airline was sought to replace Ryanair on its very popular route to Dublin. Aer Arann were their successors and commenced operations shortly after. The flights continued until the closure of the airport in 2014.\n\nDuring 2011 the airfield underwent a number of changes. Runway 07/25 was closed as an active runway and was re-opened as Taxiway C, running the full length of the old runway. The previous Taxiway C was closed and its northern part, between Runway 10/28 and the old Runway 07/25, was opened as an extension of Taxiway E. Another notable change was the relocation of the airport's Fire Services from north of the fuel farm to a more central position, between the terminal and some of the flying clubs, on the Taxiway B ramp.\n\nOn 28 January 2012 plans were unveiled to launch a twice-weekly service to Albert - Picardie Airport with Danish Air Transport using ATR-72. The new route was planned to start in the last week of April; however, the flights were cancelled before the route was officially opened.\n\nDuring June 2012 Jet2.com announced plans to fly to Dalaman and Ibiza from May 2013. About a week later, the company also added Lanzarote to its destination list. Jersey had been replaced by Ibiza for the 2013 season, which brought the Jet2 destination list up to 10.\n\nAt the beginning of November 2012 it was announced by Jet2 that they would fly to Lanzarote all year round. This was a further development to the schedule, which saw the addition of three new destinations to airport, and three destinations for the company during the winter months. Following Jet2's announcement that it would offer a year-round service to Lanzarote, the airline also revealed plans to operate the service with a larger aircraft starting in October 2013. This announcement came at the start of April, just before the summer season began. The aircraft they will would use was the larger 737-800, something which had not been seen at Blackpool since Ryanair discontinued their 737-800 services in January 2009.\n\nOn 13 May Jet2 announced, via their website, that they had re-added Menorca to Blackpool Airport's destination list. The weekly flight would depart from Blackpool from 21 May 2014 and would be available to book throughout the summer.\n\nFollowing the end of the 2013 summer season, it was announced that Jet2 was cancelling their Belfast flight because of continuous falling passenger figures. The loss of the Belfast service brought Jet2's destinations at the resort airport down to 10, leaving Citywing as the only airline operating a daily flight to Belfast, via the Isle of Man.\n\nStatistically 2013 was the best year for passenger movements through the airport since 2009, with 262,630 passengers using the facility. The increase was directly linked to the introduction of three new summer Jet2 destinations, Dalaman, Ibiza and Lanzarote, which increased the passenger count by around 10% over the previous year.\n\nOn 4 April 2014 it was announced, via an update on the Dart Group website, that holidaymakers from across Lancashire would enjoy further choice in the summer of 2015, with a new Spanish destination from the airport. The new route, starting from May 2015, would be Reus in eastern Spain. This would take the total number of Jet2 destinations to 11 and the number of destinations to mainland Spain to four.\n\nDuring the last week of August 2014, Balfour Beatty announced that it was to put the airport up for sale. Local newspaper the \"Blackpool Gazette\" reported that the company had \"decided to sell its operating interests in the site as part of a wider decision to sell all its interests in regional airports.\" The news came six years after the company bought a 95% stake in the airport for £14m.\n\nOn 7 October 2014 it was announced that the airport would close on 15 October 2014, as a buyer could not be found. The final flight was Citywing \"V9117\" to Isle of Man. The last commercial flight to depart was Flight EGL62X to Exeter, operated by Capital Air Charter.\n\nOn 18 November 2014 Squires Gate Airport Operations (a firm set up by parent organisation and airport owner Balfour Beatty) bought the airport from Balfour Beatty. It was understood the operations would not be on the same scale as those before 15 October, when the airport closed with debts reaching £34M and with the loss of 100 jobs.\n\nIn March 2015, the government announced that a new enterprise zone would be created at Blackpool Airport, using some airport land and some adjoining land. Existing operations at the airport will not be affected. Blackpool Airport reopened flying to Isle of Man and Belfast but in a smaller building.\n\nIt was announced in January 2016 that planning permission had finally been given, despite protests from local residents, to demolish the former passenger terminal and replace it with a new Energy College as part of the renewable energy sector of Blackpool and the Fylde College. The former main terminal had been fully renovated and modernised in 2005 and was capable of handling 2 million passengers a year. The terminal had been left empty and unused since the airport closed in October 2014, and all the landside and airside equipment was auctioned off in 2015. Demolition of the terminal began in February 2016 and took around 4 weeks to complete. After the demolition was complete, the construction of the new College began.\n\nA dedicated facility for Citywings' operations opened in the former Jet2 administration offices and housed a check-in desk, reception lounge, toilet facilities and a small departure lounge. The new facility also has access to security, so passengers no longer need to walk outside and through the Vehicle Security Point (VSP) to gain airside access.\n\nThe airport has seen a steady increase in general aviation, business jet, and the occasional military movements since re-opening in 2014. This increase in traffic is a direct result of increased airfield fire cover as the airport now maintains category 3 cover throughout the working week, with higher categories available on request.\n\nThe airport had previously seen service to 14 destinations across Europe, operated by Aer Lingus, FlyBe, Citywing, Ryanair & Jet2.com; but these flights have all since been cancelled when the airport partially closed in October 2014. Citywing had recommenced service in 2015; however, financial problems caused Citywing to cease operating in 2017, leaving Blackpool with no commercial service.\n\nFor many years Blackpool has been the base of an offshore helicopter operation, flying crews to and from the Irish Sea oil and gas fields. All offshore flights are operated through the purpose built terminal which is located next to the former main passenger terminal. Originally, flights were operated by CHC Helicopter until operations were taken over on 1 January 2010 by Bond Offshore Helicopters. Bond were renamed Babcock on 25 April 2016. Babcock operate 2 Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin helicopters, 7 days a week to many oil platforms in the Irish Sea. The current contract that was signed is due to expire in 2019 however it is expected to be renewed.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2119077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2119077", "title": "Camp Douglas (Chicago)", "text": "Camp Douglas (Chicago)\n\nCamp Douglas, in Chicago, Illinois, sometimes described as \"The North's Andersonville,\" was one of the largest Union Army prisoner-of-war camps for Confederate soldiers taken prisoner during the American Civil War. Based south of the city on the prairie, it was also used as a training and detention camp for Union soldiers. The Union Army first used the camp in 1861 as an organizational and training camp for volunteer regiments. It became a prisoner-of-war camp in early 1862. Later in 1862 the Union Army again used Camp Douglas as a training camp. In the fall of 1862, the Union Army used the facility as a detention camp for paroled Confederate prisoners (these were Union soldiers who had been captured by the Confederacy and sent North under an agreement that they would be held temporarily while formal prisoner exchanges were worked out).\n\nCamp Douglas became a permanent prisoner-of-war camp from January 1863 to the end of the war in May 1865. In the summer and fall of 1865, the camp served as a mustering out point for Union Army volunteer regiments. The camp was dismantled and the movable property was sold off late in the year. The land was eventually sold-off and developed.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, Camp Douglas eventually came to be noted for its poor conditions and death rate of about seventeen percent, although it is possible a higher rate occurred. Some 4,275 Confederate prisoners were known to be re-interred from the camp cemetery to a mass grave at Oak Woods Cemetery after the war.\n\nOn April 15, 1861, the day after the U.S. Army garrison surrendered Fort Sumter to Confederate forces, President Abraham Lincoln called 75,000 State militiamen into federal service for ninety days to put down the insurrection. On May 3, 1861, President Lincoln called for 42,000 three-year volunteers, expansion of the regular army by 23,000 men and of the U.S. Navy by 18,000 sailors. Convening in July 1861, Congress retroactively approved Lincoln's actions and authorized another one million three-year volunteers.\n\nThe states and localities had to organize and equip the volunteer regiments until later in 1861, when the federal government became sufficiently organized to take over the project. Soon after President Lincoln's calls for volunteers, many volunteers from Illinois gathered in various large public and private buildings in Chicago and then overflowed into camps on the prairie on the southeast edge of the city. Senator Stephen A. Douglas owned land next to this location and had donated land just south of the camps to the original University of Chicago.\n\nHenry Graves owned most of the property on which the camp was located. Illinois Governor Richard Yates assigned Judge Allen C. Fuller, soon to be adjutant general for the State of Illinois, to select the site for a permanent army camp at Chicago. Judge Fuller selected the site that was already in use for the makeshift camps because it was only from downtown Chicago, prairie surrounded the site, nearby Lake Michigan could provide water, and the Illinois Central Railroad ran within a few hundred yards of the site.\nFuller was not an engineer and did not realize that the site was a poor choice for a large camp because of its wet, low-lying location. The camp lacked sewers for more than a year, and the prairie on which it was built could not absorb the waste from thousands of humans and horses. The camp flooded with each rainfall. In the winter, it was a sea of mud when the ground was not frozen. When the camp opened, only one water hydrant worked. There was a severe shortage of latrines and medical facilities from the time of the camp's initial use through the period of incarceration of the first group of Confederate prisoners in mid–1862.\n\nThe camp ran west four blocks from Cottage Grove Avenue to the present Martin Luther King Drive. Its northern boundary was what is now East 31st Street, and its southern boundary was the current East 33rd Place, which then was named College Place. A gate in the south fence of the camp provided access to the donated by Senator Douglas to the Old University of Chicago, which had opened in 1857 at its site on Cottage Grove Avenue and 35th Street. A smallpox hospital, four rows of garrison barracks, and an Illinois Central Railroad station were located on the former Douglas property.\n\nThe boundaries of the camp and the number, use and location of its buildings evolved during the war, but certain main divisions of the camp existed for significant periods of time. \"Garrison Square\" contained officers' quarters, post headquarters, a post office and parade ground. \"White Oak Square\" housed both Union soldiers and prisoners until late in 1863. White Oak Square included the original camp prison and the building that would become the infamous \"White Oak Dungeon.\" Prisoners who were being punished were subject to close confinement in small, dark and dirty conditions in this \"dungeon.\" The \"dungeon\" was a room , lit by one closely barred window about off the floor, with entry only through a hatch about square in the ceiling. The room had a damp floor and an intolerable stench from a sink (latrine) in the corner of the room.\n\nPrison hospitals and a morgue were located just to the south of the camp in an area of known as \"Hospital Square\". In 1863, the army built \"Prison Square\" or \"Prisoner's Square\" in the western division of the camp, as well as surgeons' quarters and warehouses. Prison Square, which was located along the south and west sides of Garrison Square, was created by combining parts of other squares with White Oak Square and separating the area from other parts of the camp with a fence. Prison Square eventually contained 64 barracks, which were with partitioned off as a kitchen. Designed for about 95 men each, the camp's barracks held an average of 189 men when the prison population was at its highest.\n\nGovernor Yates put Colonel Joseph H. Tucker, commanding the 60th Regiment, Illinois State Militia, in charge of building the camp. Yates also appointed Tucker as the camp's first commander. State militia troops called the Mechanics Fusiliers, who were apprentice and journeyman carpenters, built the barracks in October and November 1861. These troops mutinied on December 18, 1861 when the State of Illinois tried to press them into service as infantry upon completion of their work on Camp Douglas. The State paid them less than they believed they were promised for their work. Regular troops had to suppress the rioting construction troops and restore order to the camp. After the Mechanics Fusiliers repaired damage that they had caused to a fence, they were allowed to return home.\n\nBy November 15, 1861, Camp Douglas housed about 4,222 volunteer soldiers from 11 regiments. By February 1862, the recruits suffered 42 deaths by disease. According to George Levy's 1999 history of the camp, a total of about 40,000 Union Army recruits passed through the camp for outfitting and training before the facility was permanently converted to a prisoner-of-war camp. A 1960 history by Eisendrath estimated the number of recruits as 25,000 based on his sources at the time. Colonel Tucker's job as camp commander was not easy; he had to use increasingly hard measures to curb considerable drunk and disorderly conduct by recruits in camp. He also had to supervise their conduct and sometimes take punitive action against them for acts in the city of Chicago, where the soldiers abused pass privileges.\n\nOn February 16, 1862, the Union Army under then Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant captured Fort Donelson, on the Cumberland River, and Fort Henry, on the Tennessee River, near Dover. With these victories, his forces took about 12,000 to 15,000 Confederate prisoners. The army was unprepared to handle this large group of prisoners and scrambled to find places to house them. Colonel Tucker told General Grant's superior, Major General Henry W. Halleck, that Camp Douglas could accommodate 8,000 or 9,000 prisoners, which was about the same number as the recruits it had been built for. This did not anticipate the differences required of a prison facility.\n\nGeneral Halleck's chief of staff at the scene in Tennessee, Brigadier General George W. Cullum, sent many prisoners to St. Louis before he received War Department instructions to direct 7,000 prisoners to Camp Douglas. This relieved pressure in Chicago, as the camp and its staff could not easily handle even the smaller number of prisoners that it received. In the event, the Illinois Central Railroad transported 4,459 of the Fort Donelson prisoners to Camp Douglas from Cairo, Illinois, where they had initially been sent.\n\nOn February 18, 1862, Colonel Arno Voss took brief temporary command of the camp until Colonel Tucker returned from Springfield, Illinois, several days later. Voss had to prepare for arrival on February 20, 1862 of the first prisoners from Fort Donelson, who found a camp but no real prison. For the first few days, they were housed in the White Oak Square section, along with newly trained Union soldiers about to depart for service at the front. The army sent sick prisoners to the camp, although it had no medical facilities at the time, and they had been advised not to do so.\n\nOn February 23, 1862, the Union troops vacated the camp, except for a small force left to guard the prisoners. This guard consisted of one regiment of 469 enlisted men and about 40 officers.\n\nOn February 25, 1862, General Halleck ordered Confederate officers to be transferred to Camp Chase, Ohio; several hundred men were pulled out and Camp Douglas became a prison camp only for enlisted men. In little more than a month, by the end of March, over 700 prisoners had died. About 77 escapes were recorded at Camp Douglas by June 1862. Historians have found no record of any escapee harming civilians.\n\nOn February 26, 1862, General Halleck ordered Colonel Tucker to report to Springfield. Colonel James A. Mulligan, a Union Army officer from Illinois, was appointed as commander of the POW camp until June 14, 1862. Between June 14 and June 19, 1862 Colonel Daniel Cameron, Jr. was in charge.\n\nThe first group of prisoners were treated reasonably well under the circumstances, despite the inadequacy of the grounds, barracks, and sewer and water systems. Sewers were not authorized until June 1863 for the camp, and took time to be completed. Initially the prisoners received enough to eat, with cooking stoves and utensils to aid in preparation, and clothing. A good sutler store was set up.\n\nThe Union Army sent three tons of corn meal and large quantities of blankets, clothing, shoes and eating utensils to the camp on March 1, 1862. Sickness and death among the prisoners, and even among some guards, reached epidemic levels. Frozen hydrants led to a water shortage. One in eight of the prisoners from Fort Donelson died of pneumonia or various diseases. After April 12, 1862, Colonel Mulligan finally permitted only physicians and ministers to visit the prisoners to reduce exposure to illness.\n\nColonel Mulligan cooperated with local residents who provided a relief committee for the prisoners when they learned of the camp's poor conditions. Mulligan apparently showed some sympathy for the prisoners because he had been treated with respect by Confederate General Sterling Price when Mulligan's regiment had been captured and paroled at the First Battle of Lexington, Missouri, on September 19, 1861. Mulligan was exchanged on October 30, 1861.\n\nAfter the Union Army victory at the battle of Shiloh and capture of Island No. 10 in the spring of 1862, Camp Douglas housed 8,962 Confederate prisoners. Conditions at the camp deteriorated with the overcrowding and escapes increased. Some escapes were aided by Southern sympathizers in Chicago and others were facilitated by lax administration by Colonel Mulligan and the guards.\n\nTo try to manage the great number of prisoners being captured during the war, the Department of the Army set up the Office of the Commissary-General of Prisoners and, starting in June 1862, this position reported directly to the Secretary of War. In August 1862, Lieutenant Colonel William Hoffman, newly released from a Confederate POW camp, took over that office and served in it through the war, setting national policy related to treatment of prisoners, prison camps, and conditions for exchanging or releasing prisoners.\n\nBased on reports he received, Colonel Hoffman soon realized that Camp Douglas was inadequate for a prison camp. He proposed construction of two–story insulated barracks at the camp, but the Army approved maintenance or construction of only the thin single-story structures, which had been constructed for short-term use by volunteer trainees. In 1862, Colonel Mulligan, Colonel Tucker and Colonel Hoffman all tried to get funds to improve the sewers and to build new barracks, but without immediate success. Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs said construction of a new sewer system would be too \"extravagant\". It was not until June 1863 that he authorized the construction of the sewers, after being pressured by leading members of the U.S. Sanitary Commission.\n\nTwentieth-century historians have criticized local commanders and Hoffman for failing to secure a proper balanced diet for the prisoners. A better diet could have helped prevent the onset or spread of disease, including scurvy, which resulted from a known vitamin deficiency.\n\nAlthough still with the Illinois militia and not in the federal army, Colonel Tucker returned to command the camp on June 19, 1862. To deal with local civilian sympathizers who might be aiding escapes, Colonel Tucker declared martial law on July 12, 1862. When twenty–five prisoners escaped on July 23, 1862, Tucker arrested several citizens who he believed aided the escapees. In addition, he brought in Chicago police to search the camp. This action caused much lasting animosity from the prisoners because the police confiscated many of the prisoners' valuables. The police also confiscated five pistols and many bullets. Twenty of the escapees were recaptured within two weeks.\n\nIn the summer of 1862, Henry Whitney Bellows, president of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, wrote the following to Colonel Hoffman after visiting the camp: \n\nSir, the amount of standing water, unpoliced grounds, of foul sinks, of unventilated and crowded barracks, of general disorder, of soil reeking miasmatic accretions, of rotten bones and emptying of camp kettles, is enough to drive a sanitarian to despair. I hope that no thought will be entertained of mending matters. The absolute abandonment of the spot seems to be the only judicious course. I do not believe that any amount of drainage would purge that soil loaded with accumulated filth or those barracks fetid with two stories of vermin and animal exhalations. Nothing but fire can cleanse them.\n\nHoffman already had requested improvements in the camp, but he kept the report secret because he did not want to take a position contrary to that taken by any superior, such as Quartermaster General Meigs. Not only prisoners suffered, but one of Colonel Tucker's sons, who served with him at the camp, became ill and died in the summer of 1862.\n\nConditions at the camp improved that summer as almost all the prisoners left by September 1862. About one thousand prisoners took an oath of allegiance to the United States and were freed. All prisoners who were not too ill to travel were exchanged due to implementation of the July 22, 1862 Dix–Hill prisoner cartel between the Union and Confederate armies. By October 6, 1862, the few remaining prisoners who had been too ill to leave earlier also were gone. Through September 1862, 980 Confederate prisoners and 240 Union Army trainees and guards had died at Camp Douglas, almost all from disease.\n\nIn the fall of 1862, Camp Douglas again briefly became a training camp for Union Army volunteers. The Union Army then used the camp for its most unusual purpose.\n\nUnion soldiers who were paroled after their capture by Confederate Lieutenant General Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson at the Battle of Harpers Ferry, Virginia (later West Virginia) on September 15, 1862 were sent to Camp Douglas for temporary detention. Under the terms of the prisoner cartel, they had to await formal exchange before they could leave the camp. These 8,000 paroled Union soldiers began to arrive at Camp Douglas on September 28, 1862. Brigadier General Daniel Tyler relieved Colonel Tucker of command of the camp. Under Tyler's command, these Union soldiers had to live under similar conditions to those endured by the Confederate prisoners from Fort Donelson. The conditions were worse because the camp had become filthy and even more run down during its occupancy by the prisoners. The paroled soldiers were fortunate to have only about a two-month stay. They were able to tolerate the conditions somewhat better than the previous Confederate prisoners could because the Union parolees were more warmly dressed and in better physical condition. The damp conditions and bad food still took their toll. By November, forty soldiers of the 126th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment had died and about another sixty were ill with fevers.\n\nUnder these oppressive conditions, the Union Army parolees became mutinous, set fires, and made many attempted escapes. On October 23, 1862, General Tyler brought in regular U.S. troops to stop parolee riots. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton also ordered Tyler to relax his strict discipline, which helped calm the parolees. Most of the prisoner of war exchanges between the Union and Confederate armies under the cartel were completed by the end of November 1862. All the parolees left the camp by the end of that month except for Colonel Daniel Cameron and his 65th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, who were held until April 19, 1863 and put to work as guards. Thirty-five men of this regiment also died of disease at the camp during their confinement.\n\nOn November 20, 1862, Colonel Daniel Cameron, who had been in brief command of the camp earlier in the year, and had been among the parolees, again took command of the camp.\n\nOn January 6, 1863, the Union Army ordered Brigadier General Jacob Ammen to take command of Camp Douglas, as Confederate prisoners from the Battle of Stones River were being sent to the camp. About 1,500 poorly clothed and generally physically unfit Confederate prisoners arrived at the camp on January 26, 1863. About 1,300 other prisoners arrived the next day and 1,500 more arrived on January 30, 1863 after the Union Army captured Fort Hindman (Arkansas Post). On February 2, 1863, General Ammen reported that many prisoners were too sick to endure conditions at the camp. Neither the Army nor the War Department made any immediate improvements at the camp.\n\nDuring February 1863, 387 of 3,884 prisoners perished. This was the highest mortality rate in any Civil War prison camp for any month of the war. Since the prisoners had just arrived at the camp during the previous few weeks, these prisoners likely were already in weakened and poor physical condition at the time. Temperatures that month reportedly were as low as . Smallpox and other diseases were widespread among these prisoners. By March 1863, nineteen prisoners and nineteen guards had died from smallpox. Smallpox later was spread to northern cities and into Virginia by several infected prisoners who traveled together with many other prisoners through several large cities by train and steamer to City Point, Virginia, for exchange. Most of the prisoners were exchanged by April 3, 1863 under this later prisoner cartel.\n\nBy April 27, 1863 the final death toll from this group of prisoners was 784. Levy suggests that more than 300 deaths must have been covered up at the time, which would have made 784 a significant undercount of prisoner deaths to date. By the time these early 1863 prisoners departed from the camp, sources suggest that between 1,400 and 1,700 prisoners likely had died at Camp Douglas. But official records showed only 615 prisoner deaths to this date. The majority of the deaths at the camp had been caused by typhoid fever and pneumonia. The prisoners arrived in a weakened condition, making them vulnerable to disease; at the camp they suffered filthy conditions, an inadequate sewer system, harshly cold weather, and lack of sufficient heat and clothing. A few prisoners were wounded or killed by guards who saw them step over the \"dead line\" near the boundaries of the camp or commit minor offenses, but such incidents occurred infrequently. Despite these hardships, survivors from this group of prisoners who wrote about their experiences generally stated that they were treated humanely at Camp Douglas.\n\nGeneral Ammen was ordered to Springfield to command the District of Illinois on April 13, 1863. Colonel Cameron took command of the camp for a week.\n\nFor about two weeks, Captain John C. Phillips was the senior officer at the camp and in command. Between May 12, 1863 and August 18, 1863, Captain J. S. Putnam was in charge of the almost empty camp, which then held only about fifty prisoners.\n\nThe army made some improvements to the camp and planned others in the summer of 1863 because it intended to return the camp to its original purpose of housing and training new Union Army recruits. But, Union victories during the summer of 1863 produced a large number of prisoners. Camp Douglas was returned to use as a POW camp from this time until the end of the war.\n\nThe first of the new Confederate prisoners, 558 militant guerrilla raiders who had been under the command of Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan, arrived at the camp on August 20, 1863. Colonel Charles V. DeLand, who had been a prisoner of the Confederates earlier in the war and would be again, and who had commanded the First Michigan Sharpshooters in the pursuit of Morgan, was ordered to take command of the camp on August 18, 1863. Colonel DeLand was appointed commandant of the camp because he was the senior officer of the regiment guarding the prisoners as they were brought there. By September 26, 1863, a total of 4,234 Confederate prisoners were being held at Camp Douglas. On October 9, 1863, Dr. A. M. Clark, medical director of prisoners, inspected the camp and found the number of prisoners had risen to 6,085, with only 978 Union soldiers in the garrison to guard them.\n\nColonel DeLand tried to impose discipline on the disorderly camp but was frustrated by its poor condition and corrupt guards, including especially those from his own regiment. Because only two water hydrants were available to the prisoners, they had to wait in the cold for hours to get water. Open sinks (latrines), or sewers, ran through the middle of the camp. The rundown buildings provided inadequate shelter. Hospital capacity, with 120 beds for prisoners and 50 beds for guards, was seriously inadequate. The post chapel was converted into hospital space, but there was still insufficient capacity for all the sick prisoners and guards.\n\nDuring this period, in retaliation for treatment of Union prisoners by Confederates, an undisclosed official in the high command ordered the cook stoves, which also provided heat, replaced by boilers. These large pots provided little heat for the buildings and destroyed the quality of the food cooked in them.\n\nDeLand put infantry prisoners to work building a new sewer system for the camp. Prisoners were not required to work but many volunteered, probably in part because they were paid in chewing tobacco and clothing. He also had them begin construction on a more substantial stockade. After criticism from Dr. Clark and Colonel Hoffman, who reviewed reports on the camps, in mid-October 1863 DeLand provided the prisoners with cooking utensils, one hundred barrels of lime, twenty-four white-wash brushes, and a quantity of lumber for repairs and washing of buildings. On October 25, 1863, DeLand ordered that prisoners clean their quarters regularly, but overcrowding seems to have made it impossible to keep the barracks sanitary. Construction of the new sewers was finished by November 6, 1863, but this new system had inadequate pipes and ran along only two sides of the camp. Additional improvements at this time included laying of water pipes and the near completion of fences for the first time since the camp became a prisoner detention facility.\n\nPrisoners who tried to escape were placed in White Oak Dungeon, an space under the guard room, which had only one small window and was permeated with an intolerable stench. In his October 1863 inspection, Dr. Clark found 24 prisoners in this space, which he described as suitable for no more than 3 or 4. Morgan's men attempted many escapes because of the weak security force. Twenty-six prisoners escaped from the dungeon on October 26, 1863. More than 150 prisoners escaped during DeLand's period of command of the camp.\n\nPresident Lincoln's brother-in-law, Ninian Wirt Edwards, a Union Army captain, contracted with vendors to supply meat and other rations to military camps. Their subcontractors delivered poor quality rations directly to prisoners at Camp Douglas and not to the camp commissary. The garrison also received poor quality meat from these subcontractors. News of this developed into a scandal that carried over to the administration of the next camp commander.\n\nDeLand was pressured to increase security but had several factors working against him: the layout of camp, guards from the Invalid Corps who were unable to perform efficiently, and the quartering of prisoners and guards together at White Oak Square. Together with the ease by which money could be sent or brought to prisoners, these factors contributed to corruption and bribery. On one occasion, DeLand lined up the prisoners from the 8th Kentucky Cavalry Regiment when a tunnel was found under their barracks and ordered guards to shoot \"if any sat down.\" One prisoner was killed and two were wounded by the guards before the line–up was concluded. Finally, fifteen to twenty men confessed to being the main diggers and were sent to White Oak Dungeon. Later, DeLand hung three men by their thumbs so they partly had to tip toe for an hour, allegedly because they threatened an informer. One of these men fainted and another threw up on himself. DeLand imposed the same punishment at least one more time.\n\nDeLand ordered men out of barracks for long periods of time while searches for tunnels were conducted. He ordered that cook stoves be extinguished when \"Taps\" was played at sunset, which was a hardship during cold weather. Despite these measures, about 100 of Morgan's men escaped through a tunnel on December 3, 1863. Most were recaptured. DeLand ordered guards to shout only one challenge to prisoners who came too near a fence or outside a barracks at night before firing if they did not obey. Confederate prisoner T.D. Henry suggests that most shooting incidents at Camp Douglas occurred during DeLand's term as commandant. To discourage escape attempts, prisoners who went to use latrines at night had to leave their clothes in the barracks regardless of the weather.\n\nOn November 9, 1863, Colonel Benjamin J. Sweet, commander of the Eighth Regiment of the Invalid Corps guarding the camp, challenged Colonel DeLand's command of the camp because Sweet's commission arguably pre-dated DeLand's. A few days later, DeLand reacted quickly to prevent escapes when a fire destroyed of barracks, fences and the sutler's shop on November 11, 1863. This worked in his favor. Colonel Hoffman ordered that Colonel DeLand remain as commander. Hoffman ordered DeLand to cut rations at this time, which increased the hardships of the prisoners, although they still seem to have had a sufficient quantity of food daily.\n\nBecause of the serious fire damage, Hoffman decided to go to Chicago to inspect the camp himself, arriving on November 15, 1863. DeLand bribed prisoners with whiskey to clean up the camp for Hoffman's visit. On November 18, 1863, Brigadier General William W. Orme, who reported directly to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, showed up to inspect the camp in preparation for Orme taking over command. Orme noted that the garrison of 876 men was dangerously small and that sixty–one men had escaped in the preceding three months. Chicago doctors who inspected the prison in 1863 called Camp Douglas an \"extermination camp.\" It quickly became the largest Confederate burial ground outside of the South.\n\nThe Army ordered sutler stores at prison camps shut down on December 1, 1863 in retaliation for reported Confederate mistreatment of Union prisoners. The store at Camp Douglas was closed on December 12. After a successful tunneling escape on December 3, Colonel DeLand ordered all floors torn out of barracks, to be replaced by dirt even with the floor joist. This resulted in conditions that increased sickness and mortality. The garrison also tore out partitions in the barracks. DeLand confiscated warm coats, possibly to prevent escapes but as likely in retaliation for past escapes and attempts. On December 17, 1863, the prison camp officials closed the barber shop and newsstand, and stopped sales of stamps, envelopes and writing paper, likely also in retaliation for the major escape attempt. When Sergeant–Major Oscar Cliett of the 55th Georgia Infantry Regiment reported to DeLand that his men rejected an offer of amnesty if they joined the Union Navy because they could not swim, DeLand had him placed in the dungeon for twenty-one days. Despite these harsh actions, DeLand also worked to free fifty underage prisoners who he discovered were between the ages of 14 and 17 The Army did not free them.\n\nOn December 23, 1863, Brigadier General William W. Orme relieved Colonel DeLand as commander of the camp; Colonel DeLand remained at the camp until March 11, 1864 as commander of the garrison. Orme had arranged to increase the garrison; about 400 reinforcements for the guards from the 15th regiment of the Invalid Corps under Colonel James C. Strong arrived the next day. On March 18, 1864, in an effort to improve morale, the Union Army renamed the Invalid Corps as the Veteran Reserve Corps.\n\nGeneral Orme tried to handle the continuing scandal over the poor quality beef as well as other administrative problems which he inherited. After investigation, he exonerated Ninian Edwards and his vendors, and placed the blame for the meat problem solely on sub–contractors. Despite Edwards' exoneration and his relationship with the President, the Army took control of subsistence at the camp away from Edwards on January 27, 1864. Edwards, a captain in the Union Army, was reassigned as food commissary and treasurer of the prison fund in March 1864.\n\nA blizzard and temperatures of occurred on January 1, 1864. Some prisoners who escaped at this time were found frozen to death nearby. On January 8, 1864, General Orme instituted a program of armed guard patrols. Some prisoners reported killing and eating rats after a prison kitchen was demolished on January 10, 1864 and food shortages resulted, but the reports appear to be dubious. General Orme obtained some Union army overcoats outside of channels and distributed them to prisoners. But when Colonel Hoffman learned of his actions, he reprimanded him for proceeding outside regulations.\n\nDr. Edward D. Kittoe of the surgeon general's office inspected the camp on January 18, 1864. He found the severely overcrowded barracks deep in filth and mud, and swarming with vermin due to the lack of flooring. Cooking was deficient and garbage littered the streets. Old sinks (latrines) were not sealed properly and waste was seeping to the surface. Dr. Kittoe gave high marks to the hospital but noted that 250 sick men remained in barracks because the hospital's 234 beds were full. He found that thirty-six percent of the prisoners were ill, and fifty-seven prisoners had died in December 1863. The guards also were suffering from the poor conditions at the camp, with twenty-nine percent ill and six deaths among them in December 1863. Dr. Kittoe concluded the camp was unfit for use, but it remained in use.\n\nOn January 20, 1864, prisoners began to be transferred from White Oak Square to Prisoner's Square. The construction added to the camp. The barracks had to be moved on rollers. When unpaid prisoners refused to do further work on the move, they were forced to use makeshift shelters rather than being allowed to sleep in the partially moved buildings. All the prisoners were not moved from White Oak Square until April 1864.\n\nThanks to another inspection of the camp by Dr. Clark on February 4, 1864, flooring was restored to the barracks. Clark found that the number of working hydrants for supplying water to the camp had been increased from three to twelve. By February 27, 1864, floors were laid in all barracks and the structures were raised five feet off the ground on thick timber legs. This not only improved the sanitary condition of the barracks but helped prevent tunneling. During the move, many of the barracks and kitchens had been placed closer to the fences, which was found to encourage tunneling efforts. Upon the discovery of these escape efforts, prison officials moved the barracks further from the stockade walls, and reduced the attempts to escape by tunnels.\n\nOn March 11, 1864, Colonel DeLand and his regiment were sent to the front. DeLand was wounded four times in the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Petersburg. He was taken prisoner by the Confederates but was not mistreated despite his command of Camp Douglas. His Confederate captors treated his wounds. DeLand was exchanged and discharged from the army on February 4, 1865. On March 13, 1867, Congress confirmed the award to DeLand of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general to rank from March 13, 1865.\n\nThe War Department appointed Colonel James C. Strong as the new head of the garrison. His command began during General Orme's command of the camp and continued through Colonel Sweet's command. At the beginning of his duty, Strong had only about 650 healthy men to guard almost 6,000 prisoners. Strong prepared new prison rolls and found that 84 prisoners were missing. He was the first garrison commander to force prisoners to work, but work details were restricted to four hours per day. Between January and March 1864, when Colonel Strong had only 550 men available for guard duty, thirty-two escapes were made from the camp. Strong realized placement of the buildings in Prisoner's Square contributed to the problem and had them moved away from the fences and closer to the middle of the square. The fence separating Prisoner's Square from the rest of the camp was completed on March 22, 1864. About this time General Orme attached many bright oil–burning lamps to the fence to illuminate the area at night.\n\nA new sutler's store, with high prices, was established at the camp around April 1, 1864. Construction of a very advanced additional 180–bed hospital, including a mess room, kitchen, hot water, adjoining laundry and flush toilets, was completed on April 10, 1864. Yet, the hospital facilities were still too small for all the needs of the prisoners and guards. Despite the need, the camp added only 70 more beds in two old buildings. The separate smallpox hospital remained in a converted cavalry stable until it was moved to a site called Adele Grove, one–half mile south of the camp on the south side of the University of Chicago, facing Cottage Grove. The expanded facility began to operate on April 15, 1864.\n\nStrict discipline and abuse of the prisoners increased at this time. Colonel Strong gave more power to patrols and put each barracks under control of a sergeant, two corporals and five privates. Some of these individuals were vindictive and even dangerous. On April 10, 1864, guards made some prisoners stand on barrels for purchasing whiskey from a guard. Others were made to wear signs noting various offenses. A new dungeon about and high, with two small air holes, was built in Prisoner's Square. Three men spent a night there for climbing a roof to watch horse racing. Punishment through extensive use of ball and chain, using a cannonball chained to a prisoner's leg, began. Some prisoners received this punishment for reneging on a request to take the oath of allegiance to the United States.\n\nOn March 17, 1864, the War Department ordered that any shooting incident at a prison camp must be investigated by a board of officers. Thereafter only eight shooting incidents were reported at Camp Douglas: six in connection with escape attempts, one for urinating in the street and one for crossing the deadline. Two prisoners in a barracks were wounded when the shots missed the prisoner who had crossed the deadline.\n\nOn April 16, 1864, Lt. Colonel John F. Marsh of the inspector general's office inspected the camp. He found lax control of sutlers, prisoners being paid tobacco for garbage collection by a private garbage contractor, barracks in poor condition, with floors ripped up, filthy bedding, grounds wet and poor policing.\n\nOn April 17, 1864, General Ulysses S. Grant canceled all prisoner exchange negotiations and said they would not resume unless they included black Union prisoners held by Confederates. This led to a several months-long impasse in prisoner exchanges until shortly after negotiations were resumed on January 21, 1865. Both Union and Confederate armies had to house many additional prisoners for longer periods of time than in the past. When the prisoner cartel had been operating, many prisoners could expect to be exchanged within a few months.\n\nOn April 27, 1864, without authority, General Orme fired Colonel Strong as commander of the garrison and installed Colonel Benjamin J. Sweet. Two days later, when Orme was ordered to correct the problems at the camp, he resigned. He was also reported to be ill at the time.\n\nOn May 2, 1864, the War Department appointed Colonel Sweet as commander of the camp. He had been at the camp for seven months and wanted the post. (Some historians now doubt his claim to have been wounded at the battle of Perryville, because he claimed that two wounds, including a chest wound, were treated by ordinary soldiers, not doctors. On the other hand, other sources say that his right arm was rendered useless by the wounds.) In any event, Sweet transferred to the Invalid Corps.\n\nSweet proved to be a strict disciplinarian who increased punishments and cut rations. This latter action was in line with revised War Department policy in 1864. He proved to be better organized in most respects and a better administrator than his predecessors.\n\nColonel Sweet reinstated Colonel Strong as commander of the garrison. Sweet strained relations with Colonel Hoffman in the national office by refusing to live at the camp and by moving his office to downtown Chicago. His 12-year-old daughter, Ada, was living with him, apparently to act as his secretary. Confederate prisoner T. D. Henry noted that Sweet appointed \"a fiend name Captain Webb [Wells] Sponable as inspector of prisoners. From this time forward the darkest leaf in the legends of tyranny could not possibly contain a greater number of punishments.\" Sponable's patrol force of 2 lieutenants, 10 sergeants, 20 corporals and 38 privates continued to regulate rations, cooking arrangements and work details. A 5-man squad was on constant patrol in Prisoner's Square. As Sweet was not on site, prisoners felt that the garrison soldiers would not be held accountable for their treatment. For some prisoners, the patrols were a benefit because they protected prisoners from each other. The patrols cracked down on a few guards whose actions were out of line.\n\nSweet changed the rations by eliminating hominy, which he said was wasted, and candles, which he believed were used in aid of tunneling. Using forced labor to build new units, he placed the increasing number of prisoners' barracks on parallel streets. Sweet had the prisoners searched daily for contraband to be sure prisoners had no cash to bribe guards, but such hidden money was not found. During a prison–wide roll call on May 24, 1864, the guards confiscated excess clothing from the prisoners' barracks.\n\nThe top soil at the camp had become so eroded that guards had to wear goggles as protection against blowing sand and dust, and prisoners had to almost close their eyes to move around. On May 27, 1864, Sweet ordered two more sinks built in Prisoner's Square. He had more than six thousand feet of pine board delivered for repairs to barracks. He also tried to force prisoners to keep the camp in repair.\n\nPrisoners attacked the fence in an escape attempt on June 1 but were thwarted, mainly by guards on the ground using revolvers. Those on the fence lines were armed with rifles that might not have worked. No prisoners were killed in the incident.\n\nAs the number of prisoners at the camp increased in the summer of 1864, the War Department again reduced rations, in retaliation for the Confederates reducing rations for Union prisoners. Rations reportedly no longer lasted quite as long as the period for which they were allotted. A few prisoners reported that prisoners resorted to eating rats. Guards punished anyone caught taking bones from the garbage by tying the bone in the prisoner's mouth and making him crawl around like a dog. As the length of confinements increased due to the lack of prisoner exchanges, more fights between prisoners arose. Other prisoners usually broke them up before guards intervened. Work details were still required.\n\nBy June 1864, guards had set up \"the mule\" or \"wooden horse,\" a sawhorse-type device set about off the ground, later raised to . It had a thin, almost sharp, edge and was used as punishment; prisoners were forced to sit on it. Prisoners used their hands to brace themselves when on the device, but a Confederate prisoner reported seeing men forced to sit on it until they fainted and fell off. Sometimes weights were tied to the prisoner's feet. The device, which was outside, was used in any type of weather. A guard was also required to sit on the device as punishment for an unrecorded offense. In line with War Department instructions, the post surgeon refused Confederate surgeons' requests to send medicine for free to the prisoners.\n\nThe Camp Douglas Conspiracy, thought to have been a serious plot to assault the camp and free the prisoners, was supposed to have come to fruition on November 8, 1864. Historians still do not agree on whether the plot was real or a hoax devised by people seeking advantage from misinformation. Attorney and historian George Levy maintains the \"conspiracy\" began as a con aimed at Confederate agents that evolved into a hoax exploited by Colonel Sweet for his own advantage. Levy wrote that believing in the Camp Douglas conspiracy was a matter of faith: Confederate agents thought they had created a workable plot, and Colonel Sweet made their dream come true. On the other hand, Kelly wrote that Sweet seemed to believe the plot to be real. Eisendrath also treated the plot as real. Writing at a time closer to the event, Bross also describes the plot as real.\n\nIn the spring of 1864, the Confederate government did send agents to Canada to plan prison escape attempts and attacks in the North. One of the agents, Captain Thomas Hines, believed that he could raise a force of about 5,000 Confederate sympathizers in Chicago to free the prisoners from Camp Douglas. On the other hand, no evidence of elementary planning of the details for the assault before Hines began to plan the operation, in mid–August 1864, has been foun. He soon found that he had only 25 untrained volunteers for the difficult mission.\n\nHe apparently gave up on the scheme as the Democratic convention in Chicago, which was supposed to provide volunteers and cover for execution of the plan, ended at the end of August. Sweet kept the tale alive, however, and told superiors he was about to crush a dangerous uprising. As Sweet made no effort to prevent the 196th Pennsylvania Infantry from leaving the camp 11 days earlier, Levy thinks that his report to superiors was self-serving.\n\nOn November 6, 1864, Brigadier General John Cook in Springfield, IL authorized Colonel Sweet to arrest two Confederate agents at Chicago. Sweet sent a message by hand delivery, not by telegraph, to Cook that said that Colonel Marmaduke of the Rebel army and other officers were in town plotting to release the prisoners. Sweet claimed that he had to act immediately and arrest two or three prominent citizens who were actively involved in the plot.\n\nWithout a warrant, Sweet's men searched the home of Charles Walsh, leader of the \"Sons of Liberty,\" who were sympathetic with the South, and discovered a cache of guns and ammunition. The arms were not found in the quantity needed to arm 2,000 men, as the plot supposedly called for. Sweet effectively extended martial law from the few blocks surrounding the camp to the entire city of Chicago. Sweet stated that 106 men were arrested, including Walsh and Judge Buckner Stith Morris of the Circuit Court of Illinois, treasurer of the Sons.\n\nOver half of those arrested were promptly released. Another search on November 11 turned up seventy–eight more guns. Only six of eighteen Camp Douglas prisoners from Chicago were arrested on November 6, while the others were arrested between November 12 and 16. Sweet found only fifty–one of the sixty–nine Chicagoans on his list of 108 suspects on November 6. The other Chicagoans were seized later and the other suspects were arrested outside Chicago in their home counties. Sweet's claim to have arrested leaders of the Clingmann gang of southern Illinois draft resisters and Southern sympathizers is not borne out by the records. Sweet confined those he arrested in a church before moving them to Camp Douglas.\n\nSecretary of War Stanton approved of Sweet's action; Generals Hooker and Cook sent him reinforcements, and Governor Yates put the Chicago militia at Sweet's disposal. Sweet then had about 2,000 troops available. Sweet arrested five more members of the Sons of Liberty on November 14, including Richard T. Semmes. He was not the brother of the Confederate Admiral, Raphael Semmes, as Sweet asserted at the time. He also arrested Vincent Marmaduke, who was not the Confederate colonel, according to Levy. After the release of a number of the suspects, the total number of leaders and foot soldiers in the alleged plot to assault the camp and free the prisoners was sixty–six men. The army agreed with Sweet's advice to try those arrested before a military commission but ordered that this trial take place in Cincinnati, not in Chicago. Sweet did not arrest Mary Morris, the young pro–Southern wife of Judge Morris, but the prosecutor, Major Henry L. Burnett, ordered her arrested. She was not charged, likely as part of a deal in return for her testimony. Her later self–incrimination led to the exoneration of her husband.\n\nSweet's main informer and agent, John T. Shanks, a Confederate prisoner who was a former Morgan's Raider and a convicted criminal, testified against the defendants. Sweet kept the pretense that Shanks was not his agent and lied that Judge Morris had aided Shanks to escape from Camp Douglas. In a recently-discovered letter of March 29, 1865 from Sweet to Hoffman, Sweet told Hoffman of using Shanks and asked for approval of one year's pay from the prison fund for him. No record of a reply from Hoffman has been found.\n\nShanks' criminal past was disclosed to the military commission, but it still convicted many of the defendants. On December 12, 1864, President Lincoln awarded Sweet the rank of brevet brigadier general United States Volunteers to rank from December 20, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on February 14, 1865. Shanks was recruited as a \"Galvanized Yankee\" in 1865. As a captain commanding Company I of the 6th U.S. Volunteer Infantry, he was the only former Confederate prisoner commissioned as an officer.\n\nThe first use recorded in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" of the phrase, to hell in a hand basket, was in \"The Great North-Western Conspiracy in All Its Startling Details\", an 1865 account by I. Windslow Ayer of events surrounding the Camp Douglas Conspiracy. Ayer alleges that, at an August meeting of the Order of the Sons of Liberty, Judge Morris (noted above) said: \"Thousands of our best men were prisoners in Camp Douglas, and if once at liberty would 'send abolitionists to hell in a hand basket.'\"\n\nToward the end of 1864, surgeons refused to send recovering prisoners back to the barracks due to the rampant scurvy, attributable to Hoffman's policy of withholding vegetables from the prisoners. In October 1864, 984 of 7,402 prisoners were reported as sick in the barracks. Meanwhile, in November 1864, as repairs were being carried out, water was cut off to the camp and even to the hospital. Prisoners had to risk being shot in order to gather snow, even beyond the dead line, for coffee and other uses.\n\nOn December 5, 1864, prisoners from Confederate General John Bell Hood's army, which had been shattered at the Battle of Franklin and the Battle of Nashville, began to arrive at Camp Douglas. These \"weak and destitute\" prisoners were made to undress and stand outside for a long period of time in ice and snow while guards robbed them of any valuables. One of these prisoners, John Copley, stated that rations were sufficient to keep the men \"tolerably hungry.\"\n\nBy this time, the new water pipes kept latrines running smoothly. With bath and laundry facilities now available, prisoners themselves enforced clothes washing and bathing if other prisoners were recalcitrant. Although censored, mail was sent and delivered faithfully, even to and from prisoners in the dungeon. Little, if any, evidence backs up a few later assertions that prisoners \"often\" froze to death, although some sick prisoners who should have been in the hospital probably did die because of the cold. Near the end of March 1865, a sewer pipe broke and with the incentive of forty–two barrels of whiskey, prisoners were put to work repairing it.\n\nThe camp officials contracted with an unscrupulous undertaker, C. H. Jordan, who sold some of the bodies of Confederate prisoners to medical schools and had the rest buried in shallow graves without coffins. Some bodies reportedly were even dumped in Lake Michigan, only to wash up on its shores. Levy states that bodies may have ended up in the lake because they were initially buried in shallow graves along the shore and were exposed due to erosion. Jordan shipped 143 bodies to Kentucky, according to official records, and claimed to have sent 400 bodies to the families of the deceased during the course of the war. Many dead prisoners' bodies initially were buried in unmarked paupers' graves in Chicago's City Cemetery (located on the site of today's Lincoln Park). In 1867 their bodies were reinterred at what is now known as \"Confederate Mound\" in Oak Woods Cemetery ( south of the former Camp Douglas).\n\nWith the surrender of Robert E. Lee's army on April 9, 1865, enough former Confederate prisoners volunteered to enlist in the U.S. Army to \"join in the frontier Indian warfare\" to fill ten companies. Despite the imminent end of the war, a few instances of cruelty by guards were reported even after this date. On May 8, 1865, Colonel (and by this time, Brevet Brigadier General) Sweet received the order to release all prisoners except those above the rank of colonel. Those who took the oath of allegiance were provided transportation home but those who did not were on their own. About 1,770 prisoners refused to take the oath. On July 5, 1865, the guards were withdrawn from the camp. Only sixteen prisoners then remained at the camp hospital. Sweet resigned from the army on September 19, 1865 and was briefly replaced as commander of the camp by Captain Edward R. P. Shurley. About October 1, 1865, Captain E. C. Phetteplace was appointed as the last commander of the camp. About 26,060 Confederate soldiers had passed through the Camp Douglas prison camp by the end of the war.\n\nAfter the war, the camp was decommissioned and the barracks and other buildings were demolished. The structures were taken down by the end of November 1865. The property was sold off or returned to its owners during late 1865 and early 1866.\n\nThe official death toll for Confederate prisoners at Camp Douglas is given by several sources as 4,454. The worst period for mortality at the camp was 1865 when 867 prisoners died before the war ended and the remaining prisoners were released, 2,000 in May and 4,000 in June. Only 16 hospitalized men remained at the camp hospital according to Levy, 30 according to Kelly, after July 5, 1865.\n\nIn 1892, the United Confederate Veterans of Chicago (UCV) appealed for funds to build a monument in Oak Woods Cemetery where almost all of the Confederate dead were reinterred from City Cemetery and the cemetery for those who died from smallpox near Camp Douglas. In that document, the UCV estimated that about 1,500 more unidentified Confederate dead were buried at Oak Woods. The document states that these bodies \"…cannot be traced further, except in numbers, thereby making the probable aggregate as roundly stated above [6,000].\" In the book compiling the speeches and material for the dedication of the monument in 1895, John Cox Underwood of the UCV stated that he had identified 4,317 of those buried in \"Confederate Mound\", the mass grave at Oak Woods Cemetery, that 412 more were identified by the U.S. Government in the roster of those reinterred from the smallpox cemetery and that an estimated 1,500 more were on registers burned in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, for a total of 6,229. In 1912, Josiah Seymour Currey wrote that \"there are 6,129 bodies of Confederate soldiers lying in Oakwoods Cemetery.\" \n\nMore recently, in 2007, Kelly Pucci used the 6,000 figure for Camp Douglas deaths. In 2015, David L. Keller wrote that \"the total number of deaths at Camp Douglas is somewhere between the 4,243 names contained on the monument at the Confederate Mound at Oak Woods Cemetery and the 7,000 reported by some historians.\" He wrote that the best estimates are between 5,000 and 6,000. He cited poor record keeping and the actions of those who handled the bodies for the lack of an exact number. Keller states that up to 50 percent of those who died before April 1863 were not found later. Because City Cemetery was close to Lake Michigan, many bodies were swept into the lake.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, Camp Douglas, though not exclusively, sometimes came to be described as the North's \"Andersonville\" for its poor conditions and large number of deaths. Camp Douglas was one of the longest operating and largest prisons in the North. Although the number of prisoners who died there was more than at other locations, the percentage of prisoners who died at Camp Douglas was similar to most other Union prisoner of war camps. The death rate of prisoners at Camp Douglas was lower than at Andersonville and the conditions at Camp Douglas were better. If any one camp could be called the \"Andersonville of the North,\" it would more likely be Elmira Prison at Elmira, New York where the deaths per thousand prisoners were 241.0 versus 44.1 at Camp Douglas.\n\nToday, condominiums fill most of the site where Camp Douglas stood. For many years, a local funeral home built on the site maintained prisoner records and a Confederate flag at half-staff. The business closed December 31, 2007. In 2012 archaeological work at the site was conducted and since 2013 has continued on a bi-annual basis with help from college students from DePaul University (under the direction of Dr. Michael Gregory) as well as other local volunteers and children from the neighborhood. A group called Camp Douglas Restoration Foundation, formed in 2010, hopes to spur the development of a permanent museum on the site.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although he was prone to leaking runs in his earlier career, of late he has used vast county experience to be economical in death overs. He often bowls the reverse-swinging yorker in one day and T20 cricket and has good control over changes of pace, though he sometimes can be expensive. Ul-hasan is also a useful attacking lower-order batsman with 5 first-class centuries and many fifties, including a score of 95 in 57 balls in a T20 game which lifted his team Sialkot Stallions to the tournament final. He left playing cricket due to personal reasons during 1995–1999.\n\nHe also boasts an exceptional pedigree in domestic Twenty20 cricket played all around the world, having amassed 75 appearances with Sialkot Stallions, Sussex Sharks, Yorkshire Carnegie, Tasmania Tigers and Hobart Hurricanes.\n\nCounty Championship winner with Sussex in 2006 and 2007, Naved is no stranger to the county game, having also represented Yorkshire in 2008 and 2009. Naved has been in KFC Twenty20 Big Bash action in Australia for Hobart Hurricanes, recently topping the tournament wicket-takers list with 15 dismissals in eight matches and gaining cult status with the nickname \"The People's Mullet\".\n\nNaved, renowned as a specialist ‘death’ bowler, has a century of ODI dismissals to his name at an average of 29.28.\n\nNow regarded as one of the best 'death' bowlers in the game, Rana Naved has the ability to vary his pace without a discernible change in action, and without losing control. Also has the ability to bowl orthodox and reverse swing in favourable conditions.\n\nRana was selected in the Dhaka Gladiators team in the inaugural BPL tournament, where Pakistani stars were the biggest winners, sold for a massive $100,000, $50,000 above his base price, after performing very well in the Big Bash tournament with the ball.\n\nHe was the leading wicket taker in Australia’s Big Bash League in the 2011–12 edition, where he claimed 15 scalps for Hobart.\n\nUl-hasan has been playing T20 Cricket for the Australian domestic Big Bash League teams the Tasmanian Tigers and the Hobart Hurricanes since the 2009 season. He has become a cult hero in the state and is known as \"The People's Mullet\" amongst the masses.\n\nSince June 2005 Ul-hasan played English county cricket for Sussex, where he formed an effective partnership with fellow Pakistani bowler Mushtaq Ahmed. He has also had success with the bat, scoring a career best 139 against Middlesex.\n\nOn 12 September 2007 Ul-hasan dislocated his shoulder in a match against Durham and had to be carried off the field. This was thought to have been his last game for Sussex as the ECB brought in a rule which restricts each county to one overseas player and Sussex opted for Mushtaq Ahmed.\n\nUl-hasan received offers from Leicestershire and Yorkshire to remain in English County Cricket, and on 26 September 2007 signed a two-year deal with Yorkshire.\n\nHe joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL) for the 2008 season, where he made a huge impact as batsman and bowler.\n\nRana Naved-Ul-Hasan played in Indian Cricket League for Lahore Badshahs between 2007-09. He played an important role in team's success. He was the Player of the Series in the 2008-09 edition, taking 22 wickets at an average of 12.77, and an economy of 6.66, and scoring 189 runs at an average of 27, and a strike rate of 144.27. \n\nHe played a total of 26 matches for Lahore Badshahs in which he scored 367 runs at an average of 33.36, and a strike rate of 146.8, and took 40 wickets at an average of 17.68, and an economy of 7.12. Voted the ‘2008 Man of the Tournament’ for the guiding the Lahore Badshah’s to the ICL Championship, Rana Naved was arguably in a great form.\n\nAfter a disastrous tour of Australia in January, Naved-ul-Hasan was banned for 1-year along with several other players receiving different types of consequences. However the PCB lifted his ban but he had already served six-months of his sentence. Other players implicated included Mohammad Yousuf, Younis Khan both were banned for life but had their bans lifted after two months. And Shoaib Malik was banned for one-year and had his ban lifted after serving three-months of it. And with that ban they were also fined.\n\nUl-hasan has only made the occasional Test appearance for Pakistan with little success, having to compete with Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Asif, Umar Gul and Mohammad Sami for a place in the side. As a result, he has become regular in ODI. Naved's career with Pakistan saw him take 110 wickets in 74 one-day internationals between 2003 and 2010 and a career best of 6–27 versus India in 2005. The 33-year-old Pakistani bowler has good of international experience, having represented his country on 87 occasions.\n\nNaved-ul-Hasan made his international debut at the Cherry Blossom Sharjah Cup on 4 April immediately after the poor 2003 Cricket World Cup campaign in which Pakistan were eliminated in the first round and a number of players were dropped. Playing against Sri Lanka, Rana took the wickets of Hashan Tillakaratne and Prasanna Jayawardene in consecutive balls but failed to take a hat-trick. Despite several good performances he was soon dropped from the side for alleged disciplinary problems.\n\nWith injuries to key members of the Pakistani pace attack he worked his way back into the side before once again falling out of favour with the national selectors and unable to stake a claim ahead of emerging young fast bowlers such as Umar Gul and Iftikhar Anjum. His career best figures are 6 for 27, made in a victory over India in Jamshedpur.\n\nFor his performances in 2005, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC.\n\nOn 22 July 2009, Rana recalled in Pakistan ODI squad for Sri Lanka as well as for the provisional 30-man squad for ICC Champions Trophy 2009 and a day later Pakistan Cricket Board awarded him a 'C' category contact.\n\nHis finest performances for Pakistan have come in ODIs against India and West Indies – 56 of his 95 wickets have come against them, but he has struggled for consistency.\n\nNaved-ul-hasan, the 33-year-old right-arm medium pacer has not played for Pakistan since February 2010, and has the reputation of a specialist bowler in the T20 format, where he has claimed 102 Twenty20 wickets at an impressive average of 19.57.\n\nRana Naveed-ul-hassan has also started a cricket academy few years back after his retirement with the help some of his friend Naveed Khan and Numan Inam. In one of the interview on a local TV channel Naveed Told His mission to Train New Generation and produce Better players. \n"}

{"id": "2119123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2119123", "title": "FH70", "text": "FH70\n\nThe FH70 (field howitzer for the 1970s) is a towed howitzer in use with several nations.\n\nIn 1963, NATO agreed a NATO Basic Military Requirement 39 for close support artillery, either towed or tracked. Subsequently, Germany and UK started discussions and design studies and in 1968 established agreed operational characteristics for a towed 155 mm close support gun. Italy became a party to the agreement in 1970.\n\nKey requirements were:\n\nThe two national authorities had overall responsibility for R&D, and Vickers Ltd was the co-ordinating design authority. They were also the design authority for the carriage and Rheinmetall GmbH was the authority for the elevating mass, including the sights, and for the APU. There was a further breakdown at a more detailed level and production worksharing. The UK Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment (RARDE) was responsible for designing the HE projectile and the charge system. Germany was responsible for Smoke, Illuminating, Minelet and extended range HE, although development of the last two was not completed in the program.\n\nThe intention was for FH70 to replace the M114 155 mm howitzer and equip general support battalions in German divisional artillery regiments and to equip three (two Territorial Army (TA) British general support medium regiments replacing the 5.5-inch gun. In the event, it actually equipped UK regular regiments in direct support of infantry brigades until after the end of the Cold War, and only replaced the L118 light gun in two TA regiments, 100th (Yeomanry) Regiment Royal Artillery and 101st (Northumbrian) Regiment Royal Artillery (Volunteers) from 1992 to 1999.\n\nFH70 had several interesting features, including:\n\nThe barrel was 39 calibres long, giving 827 m/s standard maximum muzzle velocity. It had a muzzle brake giving 32% efficiency.\n\nOther conventional features included a split trail and turntable sole plate. Initially, it had assisted loading, but became an early user of flick-ramming. In accordance with long-standing UK practice, it used one-man laying. All this meant that the gun could be operated by a minimum detachment of only 4 men (commander, layer and 2 loaders). The burst fire rate was 3 rounds in 15 seconds. It was also fitted with a direct fire telescope.\n\nThere were a number of design flaws that became apparent in service. The equipment entered full operational service in the UK in 1980. It became clear that there were significant difficulties with the tube feed system in anything but ideal conditions. 1st Regiment RHA, a unit that had conducted the Troop trials, developed their own procedures to solve these problems, related to dust contamination, and this process became established in official manuals in due course. More significantly, the trails of the gun proved to be weak at the point where maximum stress was incurred when the equipment was towed; this resulted in modification work on the UK guns in 1987. There were continual problems with the drive train on the flat-4 VW APU, and the hydraulic system was always vulnerable to the obvious problems posed by external, non-armoured, housing in combat conditions. In addition, the complex dial sight carrier was vulnerable to damage.\n\nThe new projectiles conformed to the Quadrilateral Ballistics Agreement between US, UK, Germany and Italy. In essence, this meant a shell with the same shape and dimensions as the US M549 rocket-assisted projectile. The standard HE shell (UK designation L15) is a thin wall design weighing 43.5 kg and containing 11.3 kg of HE. This remains the largest HE load for a standard 155mm shell.\n\nThe propellant system comprises three different bagged cartridges with triple-base propellant. Cartridge 1 gives charges 1 & 2, Cartridge 2 give charges 3–7 and Cartridge 3 is charge 8, which gives a maximum range under standard conditions of 24.7 km.\n\nEach nation developed its own fuzes and ammunition packaging. In the UK's case, this led to the Unit Load Container carrying 17 complete rounds, including shells with fuzes fitted - a novelty for 155 mm.\n\nStandard US pattern 155 mm ammunition can also be fired, although US primers proved problematic for the primer magazine and feed due to their variation in size.\n\n\n\n\nRB Pengelley \"FH70 - Europe's first multi-national artillery program\" International Defense Review Vol 6, No 2 April 1973\n\n"}

He is predominantly a winger but he has also played as an occasional central midfielder.\n\nHe began his career at Wimbledon, making over 100 appearances for the club before brief spells at West Ham United and Cardiff City. McAnuff joined Crystal Palace in 2005, spending two years there before moving again, this time to Watford before joining Reading in 2009. He was appointed captain in 2011 and went on to make over 200 appearances in all competition for the Royals. Prior to Reading's promotion to the Premier League in 2011–12 he had spent his entire career playing in England's second tier, amassing over 400 league appearances. He joined Leyton Orient in 2014.\n\nBorn in London, McAnuff has represented Jamaica, his father's country of birth, at international level. He made his debut in May 2002 although his next appearance did not come until nearly eleven years later in February 2013. He was part of their squads which won the 2014 Caribbean Cup and competed at the 2015 Copa América.\n\nBorn in Edmonton, London, McAnuff made his professional debut in the 2001–02 season with First Division side Wimbledon. He played 104 games and scored 15 goals for the club, staying until Wimbledon's last ever season, 2003–04. In March 2003, Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp agreed a deal to bring McAnuff and teammate Nigel Reo-Coker to the south coast club in preparation for their first Premiership season. Financial problems resulted in the player remaining at Wimbledon despite having already signed contracts with Portsmouth.\n\nIn the January 2004 transfer window, with Wimbledon now in administration, West Ham manager Alan Pardew signed McAnuff for West Ham United joining fellow former Wimbledon players, Nigel Reo-Coker, and Adam Nowland. He played only 14 games for the club, scoring 1 goal against Crewe. In order to generate funds for future transfers Pardew was forced to sell McAnuff and on 12 August 2004 he joined Cardiff City for a fee of £250,000 and was a virtual ever-present in his first year at the club. He made his debut against Ipswich Town, scoring his first goal against his former side West Ham United during a 4–1 win. He played 48 games and scored 3 goals and picked up numerous player of the month awards. With Cardiff in financial difficulty, McAnuff left the club at the end of the 2004–05 season to join Crystal Palace for a fee of around £600,000.\n\nIn his first season at Selhurst Park, McAnuff played 43 games and scored eight goals. His performances in the Championship understandably led to interest from a number of clubs and in the summer of 2006 being linked with moves to Watford, Bolton Wanderers and Charlton Athletic, the latter managed by his former boss at Palace Iain Dowie. However, it was announced during the summer 2006 transfer window that he would stay at Crystal Palace, and play for the Eagles under new boss Peter Taylor.\n\nAfter a less successful 2006–07 campaign, McAnuff moved to Watford in June 2007 in a deal worth an initial £1.75 million.\n\nMcAnuff endured a slow start to his Watford career and found himself out of the side for the early part of the season due to the loan arrival of young Middlesbrough winger Adam Johnson. After Johnson's loan ended prematurely in November, McAnuff returned to the side and scored two important goals – the winner away at Sheffield Wednesday and a last minute long-distance strike to save a point at home to Cardiff City.\n\nMcAnuff joined Reading on 27 August 2009, then managed by former Watford boss Brendan Rodgers, on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut against his former club Watford on 26 September 2009 with his first goal coming a month later in a 3–1 win over Coventry City on 31 October.\n\nHe scored the third goal against Cardiff City in the 2011 play-off semi final with a storming run, sealing a 3–0 victory and sending Reading to Wembley for the final against Swansea City. McAnuff started in the final and provided assists for both Reading goals but was unable to prevent them losing the game 4 – 2. Ivar Ingimarsson and Matt Mills both left the club in the months following the play-off final defeat and on 13 July 2011, days after extending his contract until 2014, McAnuff was named as the new Reading captain. On being named captain he paid tribute to his predecessors and described it as a \"massive honour\".\n\nThe 2012–13 season saw McAnuff playing in the Premier League for the first time in his twelve-year career. By 27 November he had laid on four goals for his teammates, lying joint third in the league assists table. He had to wait until February for his first goal of the season, scoring in Reading's 2–1 FA Cup fifth round defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford.\n\nHe left the club at the end of the 2013–14 season. McAnuff gave an exclusive interview to Get Reading saying he is fine over not getting a renewed contract, though he went on to say: \"\"My time at Reading has been fantastic. It's been a thoroughly enjoyable chapter of my life, a stable one as well. Five seasons is a large chunk of my career. I've captained the club with massive amounts of pride and enjoyment. I've had many great times, the Championship win obviously, and also some bad ones as well. But it's been a fantastic experience. It's a time of my career I'll never forget.\"\"\n\nOn 25 July 2014, McAnuff signed a two-year deal with League One side Leyton Orient. In May 2016, he was released from Leyton Orient when it was announced that he would not be retained when his contract expired.\n\nMcAnuff began trialing with MNUFC of the NASL in June, 2016. McAnuff made an appearance for Minnesota United in an international friendly against Liga MX side Club León on 25 June 2016 in the first ever football match at Target Field.\n\nOn 19 July 2016 McAnuff signed for League Two team Stevenage on a free transfer.\n\nOn 20 July 2017, it was announced that McAnuff would return to Leyton Orient on. He then captained the side in the 18/19 season and went on to win the league title. He has since signed a further contract extension and moved into a player/coach role.\n\nBorn in England, McAnuff qualifies to play for Jamaica through his Jamaican born father. He made his international debut on 18 May 2002 in the 'Unity Cup', an exhibition game against Nigeria at Loftus Road, coming on as a substitute in the 55th minute replacing Omar Daley. On 24 January 2013, more than ten years after he won his first cap, McAnuff was called up to the Jamaica squad to face Mexico on 7 February alongside fellow Reading players Adrian Mariappa and Garath McCleary. He started the game and helped Jamaica to a 0–0 draw in the Estadio Azteca. McAnuff was in the Jamaican squad which won the 2014 Caribbean Cup on home soil, scoring in the penalty shootout following their goalless draw against Trinidad and Tobago in the final in Montego Bay. At the 2016 Copa América held in the United States he made appearances in all 3 of Jamaica's group games.\n\nReading\n\nFootball League Championship 2011-12\n\nLeyton Orient\n\n"}

He was a right-handed batsman and useful right-arm medium pace bowler and played for Canterbury in New Zealand first-class cricket. He also played English county cricket for Hampshire and Gloucestershire.\n\nHe is currently the New Zealand batting coach and has had stints in the media as a commentator for Sky Network Television and the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Star Cricket.\n\nHis batting is often characterised by innovation and improvisation, notably with a \"square on\" stance, which he sometimes uses in One-day Internationals when he is premeditating a big hit to the legside. His medium pace bowling is characterised by an extremely high proportion of bouncers – highly belligerent for a part-time medium pace bowler.\n\nHis teammates call him \"Gladiator\" because of his resemblance to actor Russell Crowe especially his appearance in the movie Gladiator.\n\nMcMillan made his Test debut in 1997 against world champions Australia aged 22. At the Basin Reserve in 1998–99 he was part of a 137-run 6th wicket second innings partnership with Chris Cairns which won them the 2nd Test against India. Earlier in the year he had scored his highest Test score, 142 against Sri Lanka at R. Premadasa Stadium.\n\nIn the summer of 2000–01 in Hamilton, McMillan took 26 runs off a Younis Khan over which was a record at the time. To date he has made 3 ODI centuries, the first two against Pakistan, including an innings of 104 off 75 balls. It was the equal fastest ever century by a New Zealander. The record was broken by Jacob Oram in January 2007 but he reclaimed it with a 67 ball century against the Australians in Hamilton on 20 February 2007.\n\nAfter being dropped for most of 2006, he was recalled to the NZ side for the CB series in Australia in 2007. On February 2007 he had belted a 27 ball 50 as New Zealand successfully chased down Australia's total of 336 to win the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy. He continued his form, scoring the fastest century by a New Zealander (67 balls) and led his team from 41–4 to 350–9 and a one wicket victory against Australia in the third ODI of the Chappell–Hadlee Series. These performances (including handy part-time bowling wickets) capped off an excellent season and comeback to international cricket for \"macca\" as he was named in the 2007 world cup squad.\n\nMcMillan had previously shared the record for the fastest one day international fifty by a New Zealander, with a 21 ball effort against the USA. His cameo included two separate overs of 27 runs with his partner Nathan Astle. However that has since been bettered by Brendon McCullum's 50 off just 20 balls at the 2007 Cricket World Cup against Canada.\n\nA regular since his debut, his place in the side was under threat after a poor 2002. He finished the year with just 282 runs at 23.50 from his 8 Tests. He lost his place but was recalled to tour India in 2003–04 where he saved the 1st Test with innings of 54 and 83 not out. In the 2nd Test he scored an unbeaten century and in turn cemented his spot back in the side. He had a tour of England in 2004 where he broke his finger in a tour match against Leicestershire after a poor 1st Test.\n\nCalls re-emerged during the 2005 Chappell–Hadlee Series and the preceding tour to South Africa for McMillan to be dropped from the side. McMillan incurred criticism, along with fellow Black Caps Nathan Astle, Hamish Marshall and James Marshall, from the media for a slump in form.\n\nHe was subsequently dropped from the national squad to play Sri Lanka in a one-day series in December 2005 and January 2006. He returned to the domestic setup and piled on the runs for Canterbury thus keeping his name in the selectors minds. It paid off when his brother in law Nathan Astle got injured as he received an immediate recall to the side. His comeback game was unsuccessful as he was runout of 2 but in the second game he impressed with 29 not out out of a miserable team total of 73.\n\nMcMillan sparkled in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa. During what would be his final international tournament, he was New Zealand's leading run-scorer with 163 runs at an average of 40.75 and a strike-rate of 181.\n\nMcMillan did enough to earn selection for the Commonwealth Bank ODI series in Australia. On 21 January 2007 he made 89 against Australia. A month later, he scored a blistering hundred off just 67 balls, which is the fastest by any Kiwi player. His Gladiator-like efforts set the stage for a whopping 3–0 series win against Australia, and also the 2nd highest successful run chase in ODI history. Chasing a massive 346, at one stage New Zealand were 41 for 4 and with Fleming, Vincent, Taylor and Styris gone, looked well and truly out of the game. Craig McMillan's amazing innings kept their hopes alive and resulted in probably the greatest comeback by a team in ODI history. New Zealand managed to win with 1 wicket and 3 balls left.\n\nHe announced his retirement on 17 October 2007 after a Twenty20 tournament wherein he was New Zealand's leading run-scorer with 163 runs at an average of 40.75 and a strike-rate of 181. Citing personal reasons and health problems as contributing factors, McMillan said he wanted to go out on a high.\n\nHe is often criticised for his weight and lack of fitness, and he has often been involved in verbal confrontations with opposition fielders, only to lose his concentration and lose his wicket soon after. He was famously dismissed the ball after he was recorded by the stump microphone at Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist after being baited for having edged a ball and refused to walk, when the umpire was oblivious to the nick.\n\nHe had joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL), and was the captain of the Kolkata Tigers till the eventual disbanding of the league.\n"}

He then moved to Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where he made his living as a tailor. An advocate of syndicalism, he joined the Industrial Workers of the World and served time in prison as a conscientious objector during the First World War.\n\nSalomaa's depiction of Finnish immigrant life was very popular among the Finnish \ndiaspora. An interesting feature of his writing was the use of Finglish, making his lyrics difficult to understand outside of a Finnish-American or Finnish-Canadian setting. Referred to as the Finnish Woody Guthrie, Salomaa's songs portrayed the immigrant experience of working-class Finns.\n\nHella Wuolijoki, the head of Yleisradio in Finland in the late 1940s, once broke a Hiski Salomaa record into pieces during a live broadcast because she so hated the song \"Lännen lokari\".\n\nBetween 1927 and 1931 Salomaa recorded eighteen sides for Columbia Records. His best-known songs included \"Tiskarin polkka\" (Dishwasher's Polka), \"Vapauden kaiho\" (Yearning for Freedom), and \"Lännen lokari\" (The Western Logger). Salomaa's recordings are considered an important part of Finnish recording history because during this period the recording industry was almost non-existent in Finland. In fact, in the years from 1917 through 1925 not a single record was released in the country.\n\nSince the 1970s, Hiski Salomaa's recordings have been reissued in both analog and digital formats. In 1992 his song \"Värssyjä sieltä ja täältä\" (Verses from Here and There) was published in \"Mel Bay’s Immigrant Songbook\", an American songbook with lyrics in both Finnish and English.\n\nPhotos\nVideos\nStreaming audio\n"}

Side one of the original release of the album featured their eight UK single releases on United Artists Records from 1977 up to the time of \"Singles Going Steady\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release in 1979 in chronological order, while side two featured their corresponding B-sides, also in chronological order.\n\nAfter healthy sales on import in the UK over the next two years, and following the group's split in early 1981, the album was belatedly released in the band's home country on United Artists Records on 16 November 1981 as a 'greatest hits' album. However, as in the US, the album failed to chart.\n\nThe album was reissued in expanded form on compact disc in 2001 with an extra eight tracks, featuring the A-sides and B-sides of Buzzcocks' four singles released between \"Singles Going Steady\" and the group's break-up.\n\nReviewing the album on import in 1979, \"NME\" called Buzzcocks \"a vital part of the inspiration for the new pop age... This is the best album Buzzcocks never made. Hear it and weep.\" A second review by the \"NME\" two years later upon the album's official UK release was no less enthusiastic, declaring that \"this is the best Buzzcocks long-player to be realised, enshrining eight singles and their B-sides in a compilation which at a stroke helps to forgive the inconsistency of their other albums and clarifies the enormous debt which post-Buzzcocks pop owes to this frail practitioner [referring to Buzzcocks principal songwriter and singer Pete Shelley<nowiki>]</nowiki>... Employing the most traditional of beat group formations and turning their attention to the most elemental considerations, Shelley and the Buzzcocks created pop of such intense truthfulness it literally hurts.\"\n\n\"Melody Maker\" claimed that \"to describe it as 'wonderful' would be doing the lads a gross injustice... Somehow, they devised a simple, crude but hugely effective medium for songs which were fast, funny and memorable.\" Reviewing the 2001 reissue, \"Q\" said, \"When Kurt Cobain picked these aging English punk rockers as the support act on Nirvana's final tour, the Buzzcocks received long-overdue recognition as one of the punk era's greatest singles groups... this singles collection, newly supplemented with eight bonus tracks, has lost none of its vitality.\"\n\nLooking back in 2019, \"Pitchfork\"s Jason Heller called the compilation \"a paragon of songwriting about the pain and joy of love\" and wrote that it \"stands as one of the most endearing, intimate, and impeccably crafted batch of earworms in either the love-song or punk-rock realm\". Heller praised the album's willingness to address emotions through punk music, saying, \"Unrequited longing, severed ties, knock-kneed bashfulness, rash declarations of euphoric infatuation: Shelley delivers it all with jaunty melodies and deceptively complex chord progressions on par with the Beatles and the Kinks\".\n\nThe album has been ranked at number 360 in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nIn 2004 \"Pitchfork\" listed \"Singles Going Steady\" as the 16th best album of the 1970s.\n\nSide one\n\nSide two\n\n\n"}

Marianne Faithfull was brought in as James Hetfield felt her \"weathered, smellin'-the-cigarettes-on-the-CD voice\" fit what he described as \"the whole eeriness of the \"Sunset Boulevard\"-feel of the song\", given the lyrics tell the story of a faded artist who goes insane from losing her fame. The spoken words \"Say yes, at least say hello\", during the outro, are a reference to \"The Misfits\", the last complete movie in which Marilyn Monroe starred.\n\nThe song was written by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich. It can be heard playing in the strip club Bada Bing! in the episode of \"The Sopranos\", \"The Knight in White Satin Armor\". It is also used as one of the theme songs for \"WrestleMania XXVIII\".\n\nAsked if he would have bought \"Reload\", bassist Jason Newsted said, \"Not if I heard 'The Memory Remains' first.\"\n\nThe song's demo was also called \"Memory\" and was recorded in Lars Ulrich's home musical studio \"Dungeon\" on March 6, 1995 (take 1) and March 17, 1995 (take 2).\n\nThe band, with Faithfull, performed the song on the December 6, 1997 edition of \"Saturday Night Live\". A live version was released as B-side to the single \"The Unforgiven II\". It was later performed with the San Francisco Symphony (conducted by Michael Kamen) for \"S&M\". Another live version was included on \"\". According to a post on Metallica's Facebook wall, they performed the song, again with Faithfull, on December 7, 2011, at the Fillmore in San Francisco.\n\nSeveral bands have covered the song (either live or on record), including The Kovenant, Spleen, Iron Horse and The Stanford Harmonics.\n\nThe single was successful, hitting number 28 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, number 3 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 13 on the UK Singles Chart. It was Metallica's last appearance in the top 40 of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 until 2008's \"The Day That Never Comes\". The song was Faithfull's first Top 40 single on the Hot 100 since 1965's \"Summer Nights\", and her last to date.\n\nThe \"Memory Remains\" music video (directed by Paul Andresen) features a surreal, anti-gravity concept. The band plays on a large, suspended platform making full and continuous rotations throughout the performance, like an enormous swing. The platform and band are actually stationary and the room, a giant constructed box, spins around it. Marianne Faithfull sings in a dark corridor and turns the crank of a street organ, the crank presumably attached to the rotating platform upon which the band plays. In some scenes paper money rains down, an allegorical reference.\n\nAccording to Encyclopedia Metallica, the video was shot at the Van Nuys Airport and cost $400,000, with the large platform costing over $100,000. The video premiered on MTV's \"Mattrock\" on November 15, 1997.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2119174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2119174", "title": "Effects of global warming", "text": "Effects of global warming\n\nThe effects of global warming or climate damage include far-reaching and long-lasting changes to the natural environment, to ecosystems and human societies caused directly or indirectly by human emissions of greenhouse gases. It also includes the economic and social changes which stem from living in a warmer world. \n\nMany physical impacts of global warming are already visible, including extreme weather events, glacier retreat, changes in the timing of seasonal events (e.g., earlier flowering of plants), sea level rise, and declines in Arctic sea ice extent. The future impact of global warming depends on the extent to which nations implement prevention efforts and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ocean acidification is not a consequence of global warming, but instead has the same cause: increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide.\n\nClimate change has already impacted ecosystems and humans as well. In combination with climate variability, it makes food insecurity worse in many places and puts pressure on fresh water supply. This in combination with extreme weather events, leads to negative effects on human health. Rising temperatures threaten development because of negative effects on economic growth in developing countries. The social impact of climate change will be further affected by society's efforts to prepare and adapt. Global warming already contributes to migration in different parts of the world.\n\nNear-term climate change policies significantly affect long-term climate change impacts. Stringent mitigation policies might be able to limit global warming (in 2100) to around 2 °C or below, relative to pre-industrial levels. Without mitigation, increased energy demand and extensive use of fossil fuels might lead to global warming of around 4 °C. Higher magnitudes of global warming would be more difficult to adapt to, and would increase the risk of negative impacts.\n\nGlobal warming refers to the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system. It is a major aspect of climate change, and has been demonstrated by the instrumental temperature record which shows global warming of around 1 °C since the pre-industrial period, although the bulk of this (0.9°C) has occurred since 1970. A wide variety of temperature proxies together prove that the 20th century was the hottest recorded in the last 2,000 years. Compared to climate variability in the past, current warming is also more globally coherent, affecting 98% of the planet. The impact on the environment, ecosystems, the animal kingdom, society and humanity depends on how much more the Earth warms.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report concluded, \"It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\" This has been brought about primarily through the burning of fossil fuels which has led to a significant increase in the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere.\n\nIndividual consumers, corporate decision makers, the fossil fuel industries, government responses and the extent to which different countries agree to cooperate all have a profound impact on how much greenhouse gases the worlds emits. As the crisis and modelling techniques have evolved, the IPCC and other climate scientists have tried a number of different tools to estimate likely greenhouse gas emissions in the future.\n\nRepresentative Concentration Pathways” (RCPs) were based on possible differences in radiative forcing occurring in the next 100 years but do not include socioeconomic “narratives” to go alongside them. Another group of climate scientists, economists and energy system modellers took a different approach known as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs); this is based on how socioeconomic factors such as population, economic growth, education, urbanisation and the rate of technological development might change over the next century. The SSPs describe five different trajectories which describe future climactic developments in the absence of new environmental policies beyond those in place today. They also explore the implications of different climate change mitigation scenarios.\n\nThe range in temperature projections partly reflects the choice of emissions scenario, and the degree of \"climate sensitivity\". The projected magnitude of warming by 2100 is closely related to the level of cumulative emissions over the 21st century (i.e. total emissions between 2000–2100). The higher the cumulative emissions over this time period, the greater the level of warming is projected to occur. Climate sensitivity reflects uncertainty in the response of the climate system to past and future GHG emissions. Higher estimates of climate sensitivity lead to greater projected warming, while lower estimates lead to less projected warming.\n\nThe IPCC's Fifth Report, released in 2014, states that relative to the average from year 1850 to 1900, global surface temperature change by the end of the 21st century is likely to exceed 1.5 °C and may well exceed 2 °C for all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. It is likely to exceed 2°C\nfor RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, and more likely than not to exceed 2°C for RCP4.5. The IPCC says the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions, RCP 8.5, will lead to a temperature increase of about 4.3˚C by 2100. Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. \n\nThe Climate Action Tracker also says mitigation policies currently in place around the world will result in about 3.0°C warming above pre-industrial levels. However, if current plans are not actually implemented, global warming is expected to reach 4.1°C to 4.8°C by 2100. CAT goes on to say there is a substantial gap between national plans and commitments and actual actions so far taken by governments around the world.\n\nEven if emissions were drastically reduced overnight, the warming process is irreversible because takes hundreds of years to break down, and global temperatures will remain close to their highest level for at least the next 1,000 years.\n\nOne of the methods scientists use to predict the effects of human-caused climate change, is to investigate past natural changes in climate. Scientists have used various \"proxy\" data to assess changes in Earth's past climate or paleoclimate. Sources of proxy data include historical records such as tree rings, ice cores, corals, and ocean and lake sediments. The data shows that recent warming has surpassed anything in the last 2,000 years.\n\nBy the end of the 21st century, temperatures may increase to a level not experienced since the mid-Pliocene, around 3 million years ago. At that time, mean global temperatures were about 2–4 °C warmer than pre-industrial temperatures, and the global mean sea level was up to 25 meters higher than it is today.\n\nA broad range of evidence shows that the climate system has warmed. Evidence of global warming is shown in the graphs (below right) from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Some of the graphs show a positive trend, e.g., increasing temperature over land and the ocean, and sea level rise. Other graphs show a negative trend, such as decreased snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere, and declining Arctic sea ice, both of which are indicative of global warming. Evidence of warming is also apparent in living (biological) systems such as changes in distribution of flora and fauna towards the poles.\n\nHuman-induced warming could lead to large-scale, abrupt and/or irreversible changes in physical systems. An example of this is the melting of ice sheets, which contributes to sea level rise. The probability of warming having unforeseen consequences increases with the rate, magnitude, and duration of climate change.\n\nThe main impact of global warming on the weather is an increase in extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts, cyclones, blizzards and rainstorms. Of the 20 costliest climate and weather disasters that have occurred in the United States since 1980, eight have taken place since 2010, four of these in 2017 alone. Such events will continue to occur more often and with greater intensity. Episodes of intense precipitation contribute to flooding, soil erosion, landslides, and damage to structures and crops.\n\nHigher temperatures lead to increased evaporation and surface drying. As the air warms, its water-holding capacity also increases, particularly over the oceans. In general the air can hold about 7% more moisture for every 1 °C of temperature rise. In the tropics, there's more than a 10% increase in precipitation for a 1 °C increase in temperature. Changes have already been observed in the amount, intensity, frequency, and type of precipitation. Extreme precipitation events are sometimes the result of atmospheric rivers - wide paths of atmospheric moisture composed of condensed water vapor. Widespread increases in heavy precipitation have occurred even in places where total rain amounts have decreased. \n\nProjections of future changes in precipitation show overall increases in the global average, but with substantial shifts in where and how precipitation falls. Projections suggest a reduction in rainfall in the subtropics, and an increase in precipitation in subpolar latitudes and some equatorial regions. In other words, regions which are dry at present will in general become even drier, while regions that are currently wet will in general become even wetter. This projection does not apply to every locale, and in some cases can be modified by local conditions. Although increased rainful will not occur everywhere, models suggest most of the world will have a 16-24% increase in heavy precipitation intensity by 2100.\n\nOver most land areas since the 1950s, it is very likely that at all times of year both days and nights have become warmer due to human activities. There may have been changes in other climate extremes (e.g., floods, droughts and tropical cyclones) but these changes are more difficult to identify. Projections suggest changes in the frequency and intensity of some extreme weather events. In the U.S. since 1999, two warm weather records have been set or broken for every cold one.\n\nSome changes (e.g. more frequent hot days) will probably be evident in the near term (2016–2035), while other near-term changes (e.g. more intense droughts and tropical cyclones) are more uncertain. \n\nFuture climate change will include more very hot days and fewer very cold days. The frequency, length and intensity of heat waves will very likely increase over most land areas. Higher growth in anthropogenic GHG emissions would cause more frequent and severe temperature extremes. If GHG emissions grow a lot (IPCC scenario RCP8.5), already dry regions may have more droughts and less soil moisture. Over most of the mid-latitude land masses and wet tropical regions, extreme precipitation events will very likely become more intense and frequent.\n\nGlobal warming boosts the probability of extreme weather events such as heat waves where the daily maximum temperature exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5 °C (9 °F) for more than five consecutive days.\n\nIn the last 30–40 years, heat waves with high humidity have become more frequent and severe. Extremely hot nights have doubled in frequency. The area in which extremely hot summers are observed has increased 50-100 fold. These changes are not explained by natural variability, and are attributed by climate scientists to the influence of anthropogenic climate change. Heat waves with high humidity pose a big risk to human health while heat waves with low humidity lead to dry conditions that increase wildfires. The mortality from extreme heat is larger than the mortality from hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes together.\n\nGlobal warming not only causes changes in tropical cyclones, it may also make some impacts from them worse via sea level rise. The intensity of tropical cyclones (hurricanes, typhoons, etc.) is projected to increase globally, with the proportion of Category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones increasing. Furthermore, the rate of rainfall is projected to increase, but trends in the future frequency on a global scale are not yet clear. Changes in tropical cyclones will probably vary by region.\n\nWarmer air holds more water vapor. When this turns to rain, it tends to come in heavy downpours potentially leading to more floods. A 2017 study found that peak precipitation is increasing between 5 and 10% for every one degree Celsius increase. In the United States and many other parts of the world there has been a marked increase in intense rainfall events which have resulted in more severe flooding. Estimates of the number of people at risk of coastal flooding from climate-driven sea-level rise varies from 190 million, to 300 million or even 640 million in a worst-case scenario related to the instability of the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\nProlonged periods of warmer temperatures typically cause soil and underbrush to be drier for longer periods, increasing the risk of wildfires. Hot, dry conditions increase the likelihood that wildfires will be more intense and burn for longer once they start. Global warming has increased summertime air temperatures in California by over 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit such that the fire season (the time before the winter rains dampen the vegetation) has lengthened by 75 days over previous decades. As a result, since the 1980s, both the size and ferocity of fires in California have increased dramatically. Since the 1970s, the size of the area burned has increased fivefold while fifteen of the 20 largest fires in California have occurred since 2000.\n\nIn Australia, the annual number of hot days (above 35°C) and very hot days (above 40°C) has increased significantly in many areas of the country since 1950. The country has always had bushfires but in 2019, the extent and ferocity of these fires increased dramatically. For the first time catastrophic bushfire conditions were declared for Greater Sydney. New South Wales and Queensland declared a state of emergency but fires were also burning in South Australia and Western Australia.\n\nThe cryosphere is made up of those parts of the planet which are so cold, they are frozen and covered by snow or ice. This includes ice and snow on land such as the continental ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, as well as glaciers and areas of snow and permafrost; and ice found on water including frozen parts of the ocean, such as the waters surrounding Antarctica and the Arctic. The cryosphere, especially the polar regions, is extremely sensitive to changes in global climate. \n\nArctic sea ice began to decline at the beginning of the twentieth century but the rate is accelerating. Since 1979, satellite records indicate the decline in summer sea ice coverage has been about 13% per decade. The thickness of sea ice has also decreased by 66% or 2.0 m over the last six decades with a shift from permanent ice to largely seasonal ice cover. While ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1.5 °C degrees of warming, they are set to occur at least once every decade at a warming level of 2.0 °C.\n\nSince the beginning of the twentieth century, there has also been a widespread retreat of alpine glaciers, \nand snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere.\nDuring the 21st century, glaciers and snow cover are projected to continue their widespread retreat. The melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will continue to contribute to sea level rise over long time-scales.\n\nChanges in the cryosphere are projected to have social impacts. For example, in some regions, glacier retreat could increase the risk of reductions in seasonal water availability. Barnett \"et al.\" (2005) estimated that more than one-sixth of the world's population rely on glaciers and snowpack for their water supply.\n\nGlobal warming is projected to have a number of effects on the oceans. Ongoing effects include rising sea levels due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and warming of the ocean surface, leading to increased temperature stratification. Other possible effects include large-scale changes in ocean circulation. The oceans also serve as a sink for carbon dioxide, taking up much that would otherwise remain in the atmosphere, but increased levels of have led to ocean acidification. Furthermore, as the temperature of the oceans increases, they become less able to absorb excess . The oceans have also acted as a sink in absorbing extra heat from the atmosphere.\n\nWarmer water cannot contain as much oxygen as cold water, so heating is expected to lead to less oxygen in the ocean. Other processes also play a role: stratification may lead to increases in respiration rates of organic matter, further decreasing oxygen content. The ocean has already lost oxygen, throughout the entire water column and oxygen minimum zones are expanding worldwide. This has adverse consequences for ocean life.\n\nOceans have taken up over 90% of the excess heat accumulated on Earth due to global warming. The warming rate varies with depth: at a depth of a thousand metres the warming occurs at a rate of almost 0.4 °C per century (data from 1981-2019), whereas the warming rate at two kilometres depth is only half. The increase in ocean heat content is much larger than any other store of energy in the Earth's heat balance and accounts for more than 90% of the increase in heat content of the Earth system, and has accelerated in the 1993-2017 period compared to 1969-1993. In 2019 a paper published in the journal Science found the oceans are heating 40% faster than the IPCC predicted just five years before.\n\nAs well as having effects on ecosystems (e.g. by melting sea ice affecting algae that grow on its underside), warming reduces the ocean's ability to absorb . It is likely that the oceans warmed faster between 1993-2017 compared to the period starting in 1969.\n\nThe IPCC's Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere concluded that global mean sea level rose by 0.16 metres between 1901 and 2016. The rate of sea level rise since the industrial revolution in the 19th century has been larger than the rate during the previous two thousand years.\n\nGlobal sea level rise is accelerating, rising 2.5 times faster between 2006 and 2016 than it did during the 20th century. Two main factors contribute to the rise. The first is thermal expansion: as ocean water warms, it expands. The second is from the melting of land-based ice in glaciers and ice sheets due to global warming. Prior to 2007, thermal expansion was the largest component in these projections, contributing 70–75% of sea level rise. As the impact of global warming has accelerated, melting from glaciers and ice sheets has become the main contributor. \n\nEven if emission of greenhouse gases stops overnight, sea level rise will continue for centuries to come. In 2015, a study by Professor James Hansen of Columbia University and 16 other climate scientists said a sea level rise of three metres could be a reality by the end of the century. Another study by scientists at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in 2017 using updated projections of Antarctic mass loss and a revised statistical method also concluded that, although it was a low probability, a three-metre rise was possible. Rising sea levels will put hundreds of millions of people at risk in low-lying coastal areas in countries such as China, Bangladesh, India and Vietnam.\n\nRegional effects of global warming vary in nature. Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice. In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system. In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend.\n\nThere are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the hydrological cycle (of evaporation and precipitation) and changing currents in the oceans and air flows in the atmosphere. The coast can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from sea level rise.\n\nThe Arctic, Africa, small islands, Asian megadeltas and the Middle East are regions that are likely to be especially affected by climate change. Low-latitude, less-developed regions are at most risk of experiencing negative impacts due to climate change. Developed countries are also vulnerable to climate change. For example, developed countries will be negatively affected by increases in the severity and frequency of some extreme weather events, such as heat waves. \n\nProjections of future climate changes at the regional scale do not hold as high a level of scientific confidence as projections made at the global scale. It is, however, expected that future warming will follow a similar geographical pattern to that seen already, with the greatest warming over land and high northern latitudes, and least over the Southern Ocean and parts of the North Atlantic Ocean. Land areas warm faster than ocean, and this feature is even stronger for extreme temperatures. For hot extremes, regions with the most warming include Central and South Europe and Western and central Asia.\n\nThe effects of climate change, in combination with the sustained increases in greenhouse gas emissions, have led scientists to characterize it as a \"climate emergency.\" Some climate researchers and activists have called it an \"existential threat to civilization\".\n\nThe vulnerability and exposure of humans to climate change varies from one economic sector to another and will have different impacts in different countries. Wealthy industrialised countries, which have emitted the most CO, have more resources and so are the least vulnerable to global warming. Economic sectors that are likely to be affected include agriculture, human health, fisheries, forestry, energy, insurance, financial services, tourism, and recreation. The quality and quantity of freshwater will likely be affected almost everywhere. Some people may be particularly at risk from climate change, such as the poor, young children and the elderly.\n\nClimate change will impact agriculture and food production around the world due to the effects of elevated CO in the atmosphere; higher temperatures; altered precipitation and transpiration regimes; increased frequency of extreme events; and modified weed, pest, and pathogen pressure. Climate change is projected to negatively affect all four pillars of food security: not only how much food is available, but also how easy food is to access (prices), food quality and how stable the food system is.\n\nAs of 2019, negative impacts have been observed for some crops in low-latitudes (maize and wheat), while positive impacts of climate change have been observed in some crops in high-latitudes (maize, wheat, and sugar beets).\n\nUsing different methods to project future crop yields, a consistent picture emerges of global decreases in yield. Maize and soybean decrease with any warming, whereas rice and wheat production might peak at 3 °C of warming.\n\nIn many areas, fisheries have already seen their catch decrease because of global warming and changes in biochemical cycles. In combination with overfishing, warming waters decrease the maximum catch potential. Global catch potential is projected to reduce further in 2050 by less than 4% if emissions are reduced strongly, and by about 8% for very high future emissions, with growth in the Arctic Ocean. \nClimate change impacts depend strongly on projected future social and economic development. , an estimated 831 million people are undernourished. Under a high emission scenario (RCP6.0), cereals are projected to become 1-29% more expensive in 2050 depending on the socioeconomic pathway, particularly affecting low-income consumers. Compared to a no climate change scenario, this would put between 1-181 million extra people at risk of hunger. \n\nWhile is expected to be good for crop productivity at lower temperatures, it does reduce the nutritional values of crops, with for instance wheat having less protein and less of some minerals. It is difficult to project the impact of climate change on volatility of food prices and use, but most models projecting the future indicate that prices will become more volatile.\n\nSome evidence suggests that droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global warming; and they are expected to become more frequent and intense in Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia. However, other research suggests that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years. Their impacts are aggravated because of increased water demand, population growth, urban expansion, and environmental protection efforts in many areas. Droughts result in crop failures and the loss of pasture for livestock.\n\nA number of climate-related trends have been observed that affect water resources. These include changes in precipitation, the cryosphere and surface waters (e.g., changes in river flows). Observed and projected impacts of climate change on freshwater systems and their management are mainly due to changes in temperature, sea level and precipitation variability. Changes in temperature are correlated with variability in precipitation because the water cycle is reactive to temperature. Temperature increases change precipitation patterns. Excessive precipitation leads to excessive sediment deposition, nutrient pollution, and concentration of minerals in aquifers.\n\nThe rising global temperature will cause sea level rise and will extend areas of salinization of groundwater and estuaries, resulting in a decrease in freshwater availability for humans and ecosystems in coastal areas. The rising sea level will push the salt gradient into freshwater deposits and will eventually pollute freshwater sources. The 2014 fifth IPCC assessment report concluded that:\n\n\nHumans are exposed to climate change through changing weather patterns (temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise and more frequent extreme events) and indirectly through changes in water, air and food quality and changes in ecosystems, agriculture, industry and settlements and the economy. Air pollution, wildfires, and heat waves caused by global warming have significantly affected human health, and in 2007, the World Health Organization estimated 150,000 people were being killed by climate-change-related issues every year. \n\nA study by the World Health Organization concluded that climate change was responsible for 3% of diarrhoea, 3% of malaria, and 3.8% of dengue fever deaths worldwide in 2004. Total attributable mortality was about 0.2% of deaths in 2004; of these, 85% were child deaths. The effects of more frequent and extreme storms were excluded from this study. \n\nA 2014 study by the World Health Organization estimated the effect of climate change on human health. Not all of the effects of climate change were included in their estimates, for example, the effects of more frequent and extreme storms were excluded. The report further assumed continued progress in health and growth. Even so, climate change was projected to cause an additional 250 000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050.\n\nWith high confidence, authors of the IPCC AR4 Synthesis report projected that climate change would bring some benefits in temperate areas, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure, and some mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission potential of malaria in Africa. Benefits were projected to be outweighed by negative health effects of rising temperatures, especially in developing countries.\n\nEconomic development is an important component of possible adaptation to climate change. Economic growth on its own, however, is not sufficient to insulate the world's population from disease and injury due to climate change. Future vulnerability to climate change will depend not only on the extent of social and economic change, but also on how the benefits and costs of change are distributed in society. For example, in the 19th century, rapid urbanization in western Europe led to heath plummeting. Other factors important in determining the health of populations include education, the availability of health services, and public-health infrastructure.\n\nAccording to a study published in May 2020, for every degree of temperature rise there will be 1 billion people that will live in areas with temperatures considered as too high for a normal life.\n\nIn 2018, the American Psychological Association issued a report about the impact of climate change on mental health. It said that \"gradual, long-term changes in climate can also surface a number of different emotions, including fear, anger, feelings of powerlessness, or exhaustion\". Generally this is likely to have the greatest impact on young people. California social scientist, Renee Lertzman, likens the climate-related stress now affecting teenagers and those in their 20s to Cold War fears that gripped young baby boomers who came of age under the threat of nuclear annihilation. A 2018 study found that unusually hot days have profound effects on mental health and that global warming could contribute to approximately 26,000 more suicides in the U.S. by 2050.\n\nGradual but pervasive environmental change and sudden natural disasters both influence the nature and extent of human migration but in different ways. \nSlow-onset disasters and gradual environmental erosion such as desertification, reduction of soil fertility, coastal erosion and sea-level rise are likely to induce long term migration. Migration related to desertification and reduced soil fertility is likely to be predominantly from rural areas in developing countries to towns and cities.\n\nDisplacement and migration related to sea level rise will mostly affect those who live in cities near the coast. More than 90 US coastal cities are already experiencing chronic flooding and that number is expected to double by 2030. Numerous cities in Europe will be affected by rising sea levels; especially in the Netherlands, Spain and Italy. Coastal cities in Africa are also under threat due to rapid urbanization and the growth of informal settlements along the coast. According to the World Economic Forum: \"The coming decades will be marked by the rise of ex-cities and climate migrants.\"\n\nLow lying Pacific island nations including Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Timor Leste and Tonga are especially vulnerable to rising seas. In July 2019, they issued a declaration \"affirming that climate change poses the single greatest threat to the human rights and security of present and future generations of Pacific Island peoples\" and claim their lands could become uninhabitable as early as 2030.\n\nThe United Nations says there are already 64 million human migrants in the world fleeing wars, hunger, persecution and the effects of global warming. In 2018, the World Bank estimated that climate change will cause internal migration of between 31 and 143 million people as they escape crop failures, water scarcity, and sea level rise. The study only included Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America. \n\nSudden-onset natural disasters tend to create mass displacement, which may only be short term. However, Hurricane Katrina demonstrated that displacement can last a long time. Estimates suggest that a quarter of the one million people displaced in the Gulf Coast region by Hurricane Katrina had not returned to their homes five years after the disaster. Mizutori, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative on disaster risk reduction, says millions of people are also displaced from their homes every year as result of sudden-onset disasters such as intense heatwaves, storms and flooding. She says 'climate crisis disasters' are happening at the rate of one a week.\n\nA 2013 study found that significant climatic changes were associated with a higher risk of conflict worldwide, and predicted that \"amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical social impact of anthropogenic climate change in both low- and high-income countries.\" Similarly, a 2014 study found that higher temperatures were associated with a greater likelihood of violent crime, and predicted that global warming would cause millions of such crimes in the United States alone during the 21st century. \n\nHowever, a 2018 study in the journal \"Nature Climate Change\" found that previous studies on the relationship between climate change and conflict suffered from sampling bias and other methodological problems. Factors other than climate change may be more important in affecting conflict. For example, Wilbanks \"et al.\" (2007) suggested that major environmentally influenced conflicts in Africa were more to do with the relative abundance of resources, e.g., oil and diamonds, than with resource scarcity. \n\nDespite these issues, military planners are concerned that global warming is a \"threat multiplier\". \"Whether it is poverty, food and water scarcity, diseases, economic instability, or threat of natural disasters, the broad range of changing climatic conditions may be far reaching. These challenges may threaten stability in much of the world\". For example, the onset of the Arab Spring in 2010 was partly the result of a spike in wheat prices following crop losses from the 2010 Russian heat wave.\n\nEconomic forecasts of the impact of global warming vary considerably. Researchers have warned that current economic modelling may seriously underestimate the impact of potentially catastrophic climate change, and point to the need for new models that give a more accurate picture of potential damages. Nevertheless, one recent study has found that potential global economic gains if countries implement mitigation strategies to comply with the 2°C target set at the Paris Agreement are in the vicinity of US$17 trillion per year up to 2100 compared to a very high emission scenario.\n\nGlobal losses reveal rapidly rising costs due to extreme weather events since the 1970s. Socio-economic factors have contributed to the observed trend of global losses, such as population growth and increased wealth. Part of the growth is also related to regional climatic factors, e.g., changes in precipitation and flooding events. It is difficult to quantify the relative impact of socio-economic factors and climate change on the observed trend. The trend does, however, suggest increasing vulnerability of social systems to climate change.\n\nA 2019 modelling study found that climate change had contributed towards global economic inequality. Wealthy countries in colder regions had either felt little overall economic impact from climate change, or possibly benefited, whereas poor hotter countries countries very likely grew less than if global warming had not occurred. In 2019 global warming contributed to at least 15 sudden onset events that cost more than $1bn each in damage, with more than half of those costing more than $10bn each.\n\nThe total economic impacts from climate change are difficult to estimate, but increase for higher temperature changes. For instance, total damages are estimated to be 90% less if global warming is limited to 1.5 °C compared to 3.66 °C, a warming level chosen to represent no mitigation. One study found a 3.5% reduction in global GDP by the end of the century if warming is limited to 3 °C, excluding the potential effect of tipping points. Another study noted that global economic impact is underestimated by a factor of two to eight when tipping points are excluded from consideration.\n\nIn 2019 the National Bureau of Economic Research found that an increase in average global temperature of 0.04 °C per year, without mitigation policies, would reduce world real GDP per person by 7.22% by 2100. Following the Paris Agreement, thereby limiting the temperature increase to 0.01 °C per year, reduces the loss to 1.07%.\n\nAccording to Oxford economics in high emission scenario the temperature will rise by 2 degrees, by the year 2050 what will reduce global GDP by 2.5% - 7.5%. By the year 2100 in this case, the temperature will rise by 4 degrees, what can reduce the global GDP by 30% in the worst case.\n\nRecent warming has strongly affected natural biological systems. Species worldwide are moving poleward to colder areas. On land, species move to higher elevations, whereas marine species find colder water at greater depths. Of the drivers with the biggest global impact on nature, climate change came third over the five decades before 2020, with change in land use and sea use, and direct exploitation of organisms having a larger impact. \n\nSignificant disruptions of ecosystems are projected to increase with future climate change. Examples of disruptions include disturbances such as fire, drought, pest infestation, invasion of species, storms, and coral bleaching events. The stresses caused by climate change, added to other stresses on ecological systems (e.g. land conversion, land degradation, harvesting, and pollution), threaten substantial damage to or complete loss of some unique ecosystems, and extinction of some critically endangered species. Key interactions between species within ecosystems are often disrupted because species from one location do not move to colder habitats at the same rate, giving rise to rapid changes in the functioning of the ecosystem.\n\nClimate change has been estimated to be a major driver of biodiversity loss in cool conifer forests, savannas, mediterranean-climate systems, tropical forests, and the Arctic tundra. In other ecosystems, land-use change may be a stronger driver of biodiversity loss, at least in the near-term. Beyond the year 2050, climate change may be the major driver for biodiversity loss globally. Climate change interacts with other pressures such as habitat modification, pollution and invasive species. Interacting with these pressures, climate change increases extinction risk for a large fraction of terrestrial and freshwater species. Between 1% and 50% of species in different groups were assessed to be at substantially higher risk of extinction due to climate change.\n\nFor increases in global average temperature exceeding 1.5 to 2.5 °C (relative to global temperatures over the years 1980–1999) and in concomitant atmospheric concentrations, projected changes in ecosystems will have predominantly negative consequences for biodiversity and ecosystems goods and services, e.g. water and food supply.\n\nWarm water coral reefs are very sensitive to global warming and ocean acidification. Coral reefs provide a habitat for thousands of species and ecosystem services such as coastal protection and food. The resilience of reefs can be improved by curbing local pollution and overfishing: but most warm water coral reefs will disappear even if warming is kept to 1.5 °C. Coral reefs are not the only framework organisms, organisms that build physical structures that form habitats for other sea creatures affected by climate change: mangroves and seagrass are considered to be at moderate risk for lower levels of global warming according to a literature assessment in the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.\n\nSelf-reinforcing feedbacks amplify and accelerate climate change. The climate system exhibits \"threshold behaviour\" or tipping points when these feedbacks lead parts of the Earth system into a new state, such as the runaway loss of ice sheets or the destruction of too many forests. Tipping points are studied using data from Earth's distant past and by physical modelling. There is already moderate risk of global tipping points at 1 °C above pre-industrial temperatures, and that risk becomes high at 2.5 °C. \n\nTipping points are \"perhaps the most ‘dangerous’ aspect of future climate changes\", leading to irreversible impacts on society. Many tipping points are interlinked, so that triggering one may lead to a cascade of effects. A 2018 study states that 45% of the environmental problems, including those caused by climate change are interconnected and make the risk of a \"domino effect\" bigger.\n\nRainfall that falls on the Amazon rainforest is recycled when it evaporates back into the atmosphere instead of running off away from the rainforest. This water is essential for sustaining the rainforest. Due to deforestation the rainforest is losing this ability, exacerbated by climate change which brings more frequent droughts to the area. The higher frequency of droughts seen in the first two decades of the 21st century signal that a tipping point from rainforest to savanna might be close. \n\nFuture melt of the West Antarctic ice sheet is potentially abrupt under a high emission scenario, as a consequence of a partial collapse. Part of the ice sheet is grounded on bedrock below sea level, making it possibly vulnerable to the self-enhancing process of marine ice sheet instability. A further hypothesis is that \"marine ice cliff instability\" would also contribute to a partial collapse, but limited evidence is available for its importance. A partial collapse of the ice sheet would lead to rapid sea level rise and a local decrease in ocean salinity. It would be irreversible on a timescale between decades and millennia.\n\nIn contrast to the West Antarctic ice sheet, melt of the Greenland ice sheet is projected to be taking place more gradually over millennia. Sustained warming between 1 °C (low confidence) and 4 °C (medium confidence) would lead to a complete loss of the ice sheet, contributing 7 m to sea levels globally. The ice loss could become irreversible due to a further self-enhancing feedback: the elevation-surface mass balance feedback. When ice melts on top of the ice sheet, the elevation drops. As air temperature is higher at lower altitude, this promotes further melt.\n\nThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). an important component of the Earth's climate system, is a northward flow of warm, salty water in the upper layers of the Atlantic and a southward flow of colder water in the deep Atlantic. Potential impacts associated with AMOC changes include reduced warming or (in the case of abrupt change) absolute cooling of northern high-latitude areas near Greenland and north-western Europe, an increased warming of Southern Hemisphere high-latitudes, tropical drying, as well as changes to marine ecosystems, terrestrial vegetation, oceanic uptake, oceanic oxygen concentrations, and shifts in fisheries.\n\nAccording to a 2019 assessment in the IPCC's Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate it is very likely (greater than 90% probability, based on expert judgement) that the strength of the AMOC will decrease further over the course of the 21st century. Warming is still expected to occur over most of the European region downstream of the North Atlantic Current in response to increasing GHGs, as well as over North America. With medium confidence, the IPCC stated that it is very unlikely (less than 10% probability) that the AMOC will collapse in the 21st century. The potential consequences of such a collapse could be severe.\n\nIf emissions of were to be abruptly stopped and no negative emission technologies deployed, the Earth's climate would not start moving back to its pre-industrial state. Instead, temperatures would stay elevated at the same level for several centuries. After about a thousand years, 20% to 30% of human-emitted will remain in the atmosphere, not taken up by the ocean or the land, committing the climate to warming long after emissions have stopped. Techniques to remove from the atmosphere, carbon dioxide removal, are a form of geoengineering. Pathways that keep global warming under 1.5 °C rely on large-scale removal of , which is uncertain and has clear risks.\n\nThere are a number of examples of climate change impacts that may be irreversible, at least over the timescale of many human generations. These include the large-scale singularities such as the melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, and changes to the AMOC. In biological systems, the extinction of species would be an irreversible impact. In social systems, unique cultures may be lost due to climate change. For example, humans living on atoll islands face risks due to sea level rise, sea surface warming, and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2119179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2119179", "title": "Climate change mitigation", "text": "Climate change mitigation\n\nClimate change mitigation consists of actions to limit the magnitude or rate of global warming and its related effects. This generally involves reductions in human emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs).\n\nFossil fuels account for about 70% of GHG emissions. The main challenge is their substitution with low-carbon energy sources. Due to massive price drops, wind power and solar photovoltaics (PV) are increasingly out-competing oil, gas and coal but require energy storage and extended electrical grids.\nMitigation may also be achieved by increasing the capacity of carbon sinks, for example through reforestation. \nOther examples of mitigation include reducing energy demand by increasing energy efficiency and removing carbon dioxide from Earth's atmosphere. Climate engineering is often controversial but might have to be used in addition to reducing GHG emissions. \n\nAlmost all countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of GHGs at a level that would prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. \nIn 2010, Parties to the UNFCCC agreed that future global warming should be limited to below relative to the pre-industrial level. With the Paris Agreement of 2015 this was confirmed.\n\nWith the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C, the International Panel on Climate Change has emphasized the benefits of keeping global warming below this level, suggesting a global collective effort that may be guided by the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Emissions pathways with no or limited overshoot would require rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure including transport and buildings, and industrial systems.\n\nThe current trajectory of global greenhouse gas emissions does not appear to be consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5 or 2 °C. However globally the benefits of keeping warming under 2 °C exceed the costs.\n\nThe UNFCCC aims to stabilize greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion.\nCurrently human activities are adding CO to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it. \nAccording to a 2011 US study, stabilizing atmospheric CO concentrations would require anthropogenic CO emissions to be reduced by 80% relative to the peak emissions level. \n\nThe IPCC works with the concept of a fixed carbon emissions budget. If emissions remain on the current level of 42 Gt, the carbon budget for 1.5°C could be exhausted in 2028.\nThe rise in temperature to that level would occur with some delay between 2030 and 2052.. Even if it was possible to achieve negative emissions in the future, 1.5°C must not be exceeded at any time to avoid the loss of ecosystems.\n\nAfter leaving room for emissions for food production for 9 billion people and to keep the global temperature rise below 2 °C, emissions from energy production and transport will have to peak almost immediately in the developed world and decline at about 10% each year until zero emissions are reached around 2030.\n\nWith the Kyoto Protocol, the reduction of almost all anthropogenic greenhouse gases has been addressed. These gases are CO, methane (CH), nitrous oxide (NO) and fluorinated gases (F-Gases): the hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF). \nTheir global warming potential (GWP) depends on their lifetime in the atmosphere. Methane has a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of about 12 years but a high immediate impact. For methane, a reduction of about 30% below current emission levels would lead to a stabilization in its atmospheric concentration, while for NO, an emissions reduction of more than 50% would be required. Estatimatons largely depend on the ability of oceans and land sinks to absorb GHGs. The risk of feedback effects in global warming leads to high uncertainties in the determination of GWP values.\n\n\n\n\n\nProjections of future greenhouse gas emissions are highly uncertain. In the absence of policies to mitigate climate change, GHG emissions could rise significantly over the 21st century.\nCurrent scientific projections warn of a 4.5 degree temperature rise in decades. \n\nAs the cost of reducing GHG emissions in the electricity sector appears to be lower than in other sectors, such as in the transportation sector, the electricity sector may deliver the largest proportional carbon reductions under an economically efficient climate policy.\n\nEconomic tools can be useful in designing climate change mitigation policies. Abolishing fossil fuel subsidies is very important but must be done carefully to avoid making poor people poorer.\n\nOther frequently discussed means include efficiency, public transport, increasing fuel economy in automobiles (which includes the use of electric hybrids), charging plug-in hybrids and electric cars by low-carbon electricity, making individual changes, and changing business practices. Replacing gasoline and diesel vehicles with electric means their emissions would be displaced away from street level, where they cause illness.\n\nAnother consideration is how future socioeconomic development proceeds. \n\nAs most greenhouse gas emissions are due to fossil fuels, rapidly phasing out oil, gas and coal is critical. The incentive to use 100% renewable energy has been created by global warming and other ecological as well as economic concerns. According to the IPCC, there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand.\n\nThe global primary energy demand was 161,320 TWh in 2018. This refers to electricity, transport and heating including all losses. \nThe primary energy demand in a low-carbon economy is difficult to determine. In transport and electricity production, fossil fuel usage has a low efficiency of less than 50%. Motors of vehicles produce a lot of heat which is wasted. Electrification of all sectors and switching to renewable energy can lower the primary energy demand significantly. On the other hand, storage requirements and reconversion to electricity lower the efficiency of renewable energy.\n\nIn 2018, biomass and waste was listed with a share of 10% of primary energy, hydro power with 3%. Wind, solar energy and other renewables were at 2%. \n\nWind and sun can be sources for large amounts of low-carbon energy at competitive production costs. Solar PV module prices fell by around 80% in the 2010s, and wind turbine prices by 30–40%. But even in combination, generation of variable renewable energy fluctuates a lot. This can be tackled by extending grids over large areas with a sufficient capacity or by using energy storage.\nAccording to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the deployment of renewable energy would have to be accelerated six-fold though to stay under the 2 °C target. \nLoad management of industrial energy consumption can help to balance the production of renewable energy production and its demand. \nElectricity production by biogas and hydro power can follow the energy demand. \n\n\nRegions in the higher northern and southern latitudes have the highest potential for wind power. \nInstalled capacity has reached 650 GW in 2019. Offshore wind power currently has a share of about 10% of new installations. Offshore wind farms are more expensive but the units deliver more energy per installed capacity with less fluctuations.\n\nHydroelectricity plays a leading role in countries like Brazil, Norway and China: but there are geographical limits and environmental issues.\nTidal power can be used in coastal regions.\n\nBiogas plants can provide dispatchable electricity generation, and heat when needed. A common concept is the co-fermentation of energy crops mixed with manure in agriculture. \nBurning plant-derived biomass releases , but it has still been classified as a renewable energy source in the EU and UN legal frameworks because photosynthesis cycles the back into new crops. How a fuel is produced, transported and processed has a significant impact on lifecycle emissions. Transporting fuels over long distances and excessive use of nitrogen fertilisers can reduce the emissions savings made by the same fuel compared to natural gas by between 15 and 50 per cent. Renewable biofuels are starting to be used in aviation. \n\nIn most 1.5 °C pathways nuclear power increases its share. The main advantage is the ability to deliver large amounts of base load. It has been repeatedly classified as a climate change mitigation technology. \n\nOn the other hand, nuclear power comes with environmental risks which could outweigh the benefits. Apart from nuclear accidents, the disposal of radioactive waste can cause damage and costs over more than one million years. Separated plutonium could be used for nuclear weapons. Public opinion about nuclear power varies widely between countries. \n\nNew projects are reported to be highly dependent on public subsidies.\n\nNuclear fusion research, in the form of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor is underway but fusion is not likely to be commercially widespread before 2050.\n\nFossil fuel may be phased-out with carbon-neutral and carbon-negative pipeline and transportation fuels created with power to gas and gas to liquids technologies.\n\nNatural gas, which is mostly methane, is viewed as a bridge fuel since it produces about half as much as burning coal. Gas-fired power plants can provide the required flexibility in electricity production in combination wind and solar energy.\nBut methane is itself a potent greenhouse gas, and it currently leaks from production wells, storage tanks, pipelines, and urban distribution pipes for natural gas. In a low-carbon scenario, gas-fueled power plants could still continue operation if methane was produced using power-to-gas technology with renewable energy sources. \n\nWind energy and photovoltaics can deliver large amounts of electric energy but not at any time and place. One approach is the conversation into storable forms of energy. This generally leads to losses in efficiency. A study by Imperial College London calculated the lowest levelised cost of different systems for mid-term and seasonal storage. In 2020, pumped hydro (PHES), compressed air (CAES) and Li-on batteries are most cost effective depending on charging rhythm. For 2040, a more significant role for Li-on and hydrogen is projected.\n\n\n\nLong distance power lines help to minimize storage requirements. A large network can smoothen variations of wind energy. With a global grid, even photovoltaics could be available all day and night. The strongest High-voltage direct current (HVDC) connections are quoted with losses of only 1.6% per 1000 km HVDC is currently only used for point-to-point connections. \n\nChina has built many HVDC connections within the country and supports the idea of a global, intercontinental grid as a backbone system for the existing national AC grids. A super grid in the USA in combination with renewable energy could reduce GHG emissions by 80%. \n\nInstead of expanding grids and storage for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Identifying and shifting electrical loads can reduce power bills by taking advantage of lower off-peak rates and flatten demand peaks. Traditionally, the energy system has treated consumer demand as fixed and used centralised supply options to manage variable demand. Now, better data systems and emerging onsite storageand generation technologies can combine with advanced, automated demand control software to pro-actively manage demand and respond to energy market prices.\n\nTime of use metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.\n\nDynamic demand plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a smart meter in order for the utility to calculate credits.\n\nDemand response devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. Vehicle-to-grid uses a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.\n\nBetween a quarter and three-quarters of cars on the road by 2050 are forecast to be electric. \nHydrogen can be a solution for long-distance transport by trucks and hydrogen-powered ships where batteries alone are too heavy. Passenger cars using hydrogen are already produced in small numbers. While being more expensive than battery powered cars, they can refuel much faster, offering higher ranges up to 700 km. The main disadvantage of hydrogen is the low efficiency of only 30%. When used for vehicles, more than twice as much energy is needed compared to a battery powered electric car. \n\nAlthough aviation biofuel is used somewhat, decarbonisation of aviation by 2050 is claimed to be \"really difficult\".\n\nThe buildings sector accounts for 23% of global energy-related CO2 emissions About half of the energy is used for space and water heating. A combination of electric heat pumps and building insolation can reduce the primary energy demand significantly. Generally, electrification of heating would only reduce GHG emissions if the electric power comes from low-carbon sources. A fossil-fuel power station may only deliver 3 units of electrical energy for every 10 units of fuel energy released. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in demand response to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid. \n\nA modern heat pump typically produces around three times more thermal energy than electrical energy consumed, giving an effective efficiency of 300%, depending on the coefficient of performance. It uses an electrically driven compressor to operate a refrigeration cycle that extracts heat energy from outdoor air and moves that heat to the space to be warmed. In the summer months, the cycle can be reversed for air conditioning.\nIn areas with average winter temperatures well below freezing, ground source heat pumps are more efficient than air-source heat pumps. The high purchase price of a heat pump compared to resistance heaters may be offset when air conditioning is also needed. \n\nWith a market share of 30% and clean electricity, heat pumps could reduce global emissions by 8% annually. Using ground source heat pumps could reduce around 60% of the primary energy demand and 90% of emissions of natural gas boilers in Europe in 2050 and make handling high shares of renewable energy easier. Using surplus renewable energy in heat pumps is regarded as the most effective household means to reduce global warming and fossil fuel depletion.\n\nRadiant heaters in households are cheap and wide-spread but less efficient than heat pumps. In areas like Norway, Brazil, and Quebec that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common. Large scale hot water tanks can be used for demand-side management and store variable renewable energy over hours or days.\n\nReducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the International Energy Agency, improved energy efficiency in buildings, industrial processes and transportation could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nEfficiency covers a wide range of means from building insulation to public transport. The cogeneration of electric energy and district heat also improves efficiency. \n\nThe IPCC Fifth Assessment Report emphasises that behaviour, lifestyle, and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors, particularly when complementing technological and structural change.\nExamples would be heating a room less or driving less. In general, higher consumption lifestyles have a greater environmental impact. Several scientific studies have shown that when relatively rich people wish to reduce their carbon footprint, there are a few key actions they can take such as living car-free (2.4 tonnes CO), avoiding one round-trip transatlantic flight (1.6 tonnes) and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 tonnes).\n\nThese appear to differ significantly from the popular advice for \"greening\" one's lifestyle, which seem to fall mostly into the \"low-impact\" category: Replacing a typical car with a hybrid (0.52 tonnes); Washing clothes in cold water (0.25 tonnes); Recycling (0.21 tonnes); Upgrading light bulbs (0.10 tonnes); etc. The researchers found that public discourse on reducing one's carbon footprint overwhelmingly focuses on low-impact behaviors, and that mention of the high-impact behaviors is almost non-existent in the mainstream media, government publications, school textbooks, etc.\n\nScientists also argue that piecemeal behavioural changes like re-using plastic bags are not a proportionate response to climate change. Though being beneficial, these debates would drive public focus away from the requirement for an energy system change of unprecedented scale to decarbonise rapidly.\n\nOverall, food accounts for the largest share of consumption-based GHG emissions with nearly 20% of the global carbon footprint, followed by housing, mobility, services, manufactured products, and construction. Food and services are more significant in poor countries, while mobility and manufactured goods are more significant in rich countries. \nThe widespread adoption of a vegetarian diet could cut food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 63% by 2050.\nChina introduced new dietary guidelines in 2016 which aim to cut meat consumption by 50% and thereby reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1billion tonnes by 2030. A 2016 study concluded that taxes on meat and milk could simultaneously result in reduced greenhouse gas emissions and healthier diets. The study analyzed surcharges of 40% on beef and 20% on milk and suggests that an optimum plan would reduce emissions by 1billion tonnes per year.\n\nA carbon sink is a natural or artificial reservoir that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period, such as a growing forest. Carbon dioxide removal on the other hand is a permanent removal of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Examples are direct air capture, enhanced weathering technologies such as storing it in geologic formations underground and biochar. These processes are sometimes considered variations of sinks or mitigation, and sometimes as geoengineering. In combination with other mitigation measures, carbon sinks and removal are crucial for meeting the 2 degree target.\n\nThe Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE-CRC) notes that one third of humankind's annual emissions of are absorbed by the oceans. However, this also leads to ocean acidification, which may harm marine life. Acidification lowers the level of carbonate ions available for calcifying organisms to form their shells. These organisms include plankton species that contribute to the foundation of the Southern Ocean food web. However acidification may impact on a broad range of other physiological and ecological processes, such as fish respiration, larval development and changes in the solubility of both nutrients and toxins. \n\nAccording to research by Tom Crowther et al., there is still enough room to plant an additional 1.2 trillion trees. This amount of trees would cancel out the last 10 years of CO emissions and sequester 160 billion tons of carbon.This vision is being executed by the Trillion Tree Campaign. According to research conducted at ETH Zurich, restoring all degraded forests all over the world could capture about 205 billion tons of carbon in total (which is about 2/3rd of all carbon emissions, bringing global warming down to below 2 °C).\n\nAlmost 20 percent (8GtCO/year) of total greenhouse-gas emissions were from deforestation in 2007. It is estimated that avoided deforestation reduces CO emissions at a rate of 1tonne of CO per $1–5 in opportunity costs from lost agriculture. Reforestation could save at least another 1GtCO/year, at an estimated cost of $5–15/tCO. Afforestation is where there was previously no forest – such plantations are estimated to have to be prohibitively massive to reduce emissions by itself.\n\nTransferring rights over land from public domain to its indigenous inhabitants, who have had a stake for millennia in preserving the forests that they depend on, is argued to be a cost-effective strategy to conserve forests. This includes the protection of such rights entitled in existing laws, such as India's Forest Rights Act. The transferring of such rights in China, perhaps the largest land reform in modern times, has been argued to have increased forest cover. Granting title of the land has shown to have two or three times less clearing than even state run parks, notably in the Brazilian Amazon. Excluding humans and even evicting inhabitants from protected areas (called \"fortress conservation\") often lead to more exploitation of the land as the native inhabitants then turn to work for extractive companies to survive.\n\nWith increased intensive agriculture and urbanization, there is an increase in the amount of abandoned farmland. By some estimates, for every half a hectare of original old-growth forest cut down, more than 20 hectares of new secondary forests are growing, even though they do not have the same biodiversity as the original forests and original forests store 60% more carbon than these new secondary forests. According to a study in \"Science\", promoting regrowth on abandoned farmland could offset years of carbon emissions. Research by the university ETH Zurich estimates that Russia, the United States and Canada have the most land suitable for reforestation.\n\nRestoring grasslands stores CO from the air in plant material. Grazing livestock, usually not left to wander, would eat the grass and would minimize any grass growth. However, grass left alone would eventually grow to cover its own growing buds, preventing them from photosynthesizing and the dying plant would stay in place. A method proposed to restore grasslands uses fences with many small paddocks and moving herds from one paddock to another after a day or two in order to mimic natural grazers and allowing the grass to grow optimally. Additionally, when part of the leaf matter is consumed by an animal in the herd, a corresponding amount of root matter is sloughed off too as it would not be able to sustain the previous amount of root matter and while most of the lost root matter would rot and enter the atmosphere, part of the carbon is sequestered into the soil. It is estimated that increasing the carbon content of the soils in the world's 3.5 billion hectares of agricultural grassland by 1% would offset nearly 12 years of CO emissions. Allan Savory, as part of holistic management, claims that while large herds are often blamed for desertification, prehistoric lands supported large or larger herds and areas where herds were removed in the United States are still desertifying.\n\nAdditionally, the global warming induced thawing of the permafrost, which stores about two times the amount of the carbon currently released in the atmosphere, releases the potent greenhouse gas, methane, in a positive feedback cycle that is feared to lead to a tipping point called runaway climate change. A method proposed to prevent such a scenario is to bring back large herbivores such as seen in Pleistocene Park, where their trampling naturally keep the ground cooler by eliminating shrubs and keeping the ground exposed to the cold air.\n\nProtect healthy soils and recover damaged soils, can remove from the atmosphere 5.5 billion tons of carbon annually, what is approximately equal to the annual emissions of the USA.\n\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) is a method to mitigate climate change by capturing carbon dioxide (CO) from large point sources such as power plants and subsequently storing it away safely instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. The IPCC estimates that the costs of halting global warming would double without CCS. The International Energy Agency says CCS is \"the most important single new technology for CO savings\" in power generation and industry. Norway's Sleipner gas field, beginning in 1996, stores almost a million tons of CO a year to avoid penalties in producing natural gas with unusually high levels of CO. According to a Sierra Club analysis, the US Kemper Project, which was due to be online in 2017, is the most expensive power plant ever built for the watts of electricity it will generate.\n\nEnhanced weathering is the removal of carbon from the air into the earth, enhancing the natural carbon cycle where carbon is mineralized into rock. The CarbFix project couples with carbon capture and storage in power plants to turn carbon dioxide into stone in a relatively short period of two years. While this project used basalt rocks, olivine has also shown promise.\n\nIPCC (2007) concluded that geoengineering options, such as ocean fertilization to remove CO from the atmosphere, remained largely unproven. It was judged that reliable cost estimates for geoengineering had not yet been published.\n\nChapter 28 of the National Academy of Sciences report \"Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base\" (1992) defined geoengineering as \"options that would involve large-scale engineering of our environment in order to combat or counteract the effects of changes in atmospheric chemistry.\" They evaluated a range of options to try to give preliminary answers to two questions: can these options work and could they be carried out with a reasonable cost. They also sought to encourage discussion of a third question — what adverse side effects might there be. Increasing ocean absorption of carbon dioxide (carbon sequestration) and screening out some sunlight were evaluated. NAS also argued \"Engineered countermeasures need to be evaluated but should not be implemented without broad understanding of the direct effects and the potential side effects, the ethical issues, and the risks.\" In July 2011 a report by the United States Government Accountability Office on geoengineering found that \"[c]limate engineering technologies do not now offer a viable response to global climate change.\"\n\nCarbon dioxide removal has been proposed as a method of reducing the amount of radiative forcing. A variety of means of artificially capturing and storing carbon, as well as of enhancing natural sequestration processes, are being explored. The main natural process is photosynthesis by plants and single-celled organisms (see biosequestration). Artificial processes vary, and concerns have been expressed about the long-term effects of some of these processes.\n\nIt is notable that the availability of cheap energy and appropriate sites for geological storage of carbon may make carbon dioxide air capture viable commercially. It is, however, generally expected that carbon dioxide air capture may be uneconomic when compared to carbon capture and storage from major sources — in particular, fossil fuel powered power stations, refineries, etc. As in the case of the US Kemper Project with carbon capture, costs of energy produced will grow significantly. CO can also be used in commercial greenhouses, giving an opportunity to kick-start the technology.\n\nThe main purpose of solar radiation management is to reflect sunlight and thus reduce global warming. The ability of stratospheric sulfate aerosols to create a global dimming effect has made them a possible candidate for use in climate engineering projects.\n\nAn agriculture that mitigates climate change is generally called sustainable agriculture, defined as an agriculture that \"meets society's food and textile needs in the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\".\n\nOne mode of agriculture considered as relatively sustainable is regenerative agriculture. It includes several methods, the main of which are: conservation tillage, diversity, rotation and cover crops, minimizing physical disturbance, minimizing the usage of chemicals. It has other benefits like improving the state of the soil and consequently yields. Some of the big agricultural companies like General Mills and a lot of farms support it.\n\nIn the United States, soils account for about half of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions while agriculture, forestry and other land use emits 24%. Globally, livestock is responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, according to FAO's report called \"Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options\"\n\nThe US EPA says soil management practices that can reduce the emissions of nitrous oxide () from soils include fertilizer usage, irrigation, and tillage. Manure management and rice cultivation also produce gaseous emissions.\n\nImportant mitigation options for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from livestock (especially ruminants) include genetic selection introduction of methanotrophic bacteria into the rumen, diet modification and grazing management. Other options include just using ruminant-free alternatives instead, such as milk substitutes and meat analogues. Non-ruminant livestock (e.g. poultry) generates far fewer emissions.\n\nMethods that enhance carbon sequestration in soil include no-till farming, residue mulching, cover cropping, and crop rotation, all of which are more widely used in organic farming than in conventional farming. Because only 5% of US farmland currently uses no-till and residue mulching, there is a large potential for carbon sequestration.\n\nA 2015 study found that farming can deplete soil carbon and render soil incapable of supporting life; however, the study also showed that conservation farming can protect carbon in soils, and repair damage over time. The farming practice of cover crops has been recognized as climate-smart agriculture. Best management practices for European soils were described to be increase soil organic carbon: conversion of arable land to grassland, straw incorporation, reduced tillage, straw incorporation combined with reduced tillage, ley cropping system and cover crops.\n\nIn terms of prevention, vaccines are being developed in Australia to reduce the significant global warming contributions from methane released by livestock via flatulence and eructation.\n\nA project to mitigate climate change with agriculture was launched in 2019 by the \"Global EverGreening Alliance\". The target is to sequester carbon from the atmosphere with Agroforestry. By 2050 the restored land should sequestrate 20 billion of carbon annually\n\nTransportation emissions account for roughly 1/4 of emissions worldwide and are even more important in terms of impact in developed nations especially in North America and Australia. Many citizens of countries like the United States and Canada who drive personal cars often, see well over half of their climate change impact stemming from the emissions produced from their cars. Modes of mass transportation such as bus, light rail (metro, subway, etc.), and long-distance rail are far and away the most energy-efficient means of motorized transportation for passengers, able to use in many cases over twenty times less energy per person-distance than a personal automobile. Modern energy-efficient technologies, such as electric vehicles and carbon-neutral synthetic gasoline and jet fuel may also help to reduce the consumption of petroleum, land use changes and emissions of carbon dioxide. Utilizing rail transport, especially electric rail, over the far less efficient air transport and truck transport\nsignificantly reduces emissions. With the use of electric trains and cars in transportation there is the opportunity to run them with low-carbon power, producing far fewer emissions.\n\nEffective urban planning to reduce sprawl aims to decrease Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT), lowering emissions from transportation. Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while public transport and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient land use development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.\n\nAt the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These smart growth practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nApproaches such as New Urbanism and transit-oriented development seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage public transit and make walking and cycling more attractive options. This is achieved through \"medium-density\", mixed-use planning and the concentration of housing within walking distance of town centers and transport nodes.\n\nSmarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.\n\nEmissions from housing are substantial, and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.\n\nNew buildings can be constructed using passive solar building design, low-energy building, or zero-energy building techniques, using renewable heat sources. Existing buildings can be made more efficient through the use of insulation, high-efficiency appliances (particularly hot water heaters and furnaces), double- or triple-glazed gas-filled windows, external window shades, and building orientation and siting. Renewable heat sources such as shallow geothermal and passive solar energy reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted. In addition to designing buildings which are more energy-efficient to heat, it is possible to design buildings that are more energy-efficient to cool by using lighter-coloured, more reflective materials in the development of urban areas (e.g. by painting roofs white) and planting trees. This saves energy because it cools buildings and reduces the urban heat island effect thus reducing the use of air conditioning.\n\nAnother method being examined is to make carbon a new currency by introducing tradeable \"personal carbon credits\". The idea being it will encourage and motivate individuals to reduce their 'carbon footprint' by the way they live. Each citizen will receive a free annual quota of carbon that they can use to travel, buy food, and go about their business. It has been suggested that by using this concept it could actually solve two problems; pollution and poverty, old age pensioners will actually be better off because they fly less often, so they can cash in their quota at the end of the year to pay heating bills and so forth.\n\nVarious organizations promote human population planning as a means for mitigating global warming. Proposed measures include improving access to family planning and reproductive health care and information, reducing natalistic politics, public education about the consequences of continued population growth, and improving access of women to education and economic opportunities.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study published in Environmental Research Letters, having one less child would have a much more substantial effect on greenhouse gas emissions compared with for example living car free or eating a plant-based diet. However this has been criticised: both as a category mistake for assigning descendants emissions to their ancestors and for the very long timescale of reductions.\n\nPopulation control efforts are impeded by there being somewhat of a taboo in some countries against considering any such efforts. Also, various religions discourage or prohibit some or all forms of birth control. Population size has a vastly different per capita effect on global warming in different countries, since the per capita production of anthropogenic greenhouse gases varies greatly by country.\n\nGlobally the benefits of keeping warming under 2 °C exceed the costs. However some consider cost–benefit analysis unsuitable for analysing climate change mitigation as a whole, but still useful for analysing the difference between a 1.5 °C target and 2 °C.\n\nOne way of estimating the cost of reducing emissions is by considering the likely costs of potential technological and output changes. Policy makers can compare the marginal abatement costs of different methods to assess the cost and amount of possible abatement over time. The marginal abatement costs of the various measures will differ by country, by sector, and over time. Mitigation costs will vary according to how and when emissions are cut: early, well-planned action will minimise the costs.\n\nMany economists estimate the cost of climate change mitigation at between 1% and 2% of GDP. In 2019, scientists from Australia, and Germany presented the \"One Earth Climate Model\" showing how temperature increase can be limited to 1.5 °C for 1.7 trillion dollars a year.\nAccording to this study, a global investment of approximately $1.7 trillion per year would be needed to keep global warming below 1.5°C. The method used by the One Earth Climate Model does not resort to dangerous geo-engineering methods. Whereas this is a large sum, it is still far less than the subsidies governments currently provided to the ailing fossil fuel industry, estimated at more than $5 trillion per year by the International Monetary Fund.\n\nBy addressing climate change, we can avoid the costs associated with the effects of climate change.\nAccording to the Stern Review, inaction can be as high as the equivalent of losing at least 5% of global gross domestic product (GDP) each year, now and forever (up to 20% of the GDP or more when including a wider range of risks and impacts), whereas mitigating climate change will only cost about 2% of the GDP.\nAlso, delaying to take significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions may not be a good idea, when seen from a financial perspective.\n\nThe research organization Project Drawdown identified global climate solutions and ranked them according to their benefits. Early deaths due to fossil fuel air pollution with a temperature rise to 2 °C cost more globally than mitigation would: and in India cost 4 to 5 times more.\n\nOne of the aspects of mitigation is how to share the costs and benefits of mitigation policies. In terms of the politics of mitigation, the UNFCCC's ultimate objective is to stabilize concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent \"dangerous\" climate change (Rogner \"et al.\", 2007).\n\nRich people tend to emit more GHG than poor people. Activities of the poor that involve emissions of GHGs are often associated with basic needs, such as cooking. For richer people, emissions tend to be associated with things such as eating beef, cars, frequent flying, and home heating. The impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human welfare according to wealth.\n\nThere have been different proposals on how to allocate responsibility for cutting emissions (Banuri \"et al.\", 1996, pp. 103–105):\n\n\nIn 2019 a report was published by the United Nations saying that to limit the temperature rise to 2 °C, the world will need to cut emissions by 2.7% each year from 2020 to 2030, and triple the climate targets. To limit the temperature rise to 1.5 °C the world would need to cut emissions by 7.6% each year from 2020 to 2030 and increase its climate commitments five-fold. Even if all the Paris Agreement pledges as they are in 2019, are fulfilled the temperature will rise by 3.2 degrees this century.\nA report published in September 2019 before the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit says, that the full implementation of all pledges made by international coalitions, countries, cities, regions and businesses (not only those in the Paris Agreement) will be sufficient to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees but not to 1.5 degrees. Additional pledges were made in the September climate summit and in December. All the information about all climate pledges is sent to the Global Climate Action Portal - Nazca. The scientific community is checking their fulfillment.\n\nThe main current international agreement on combating climate change is the Paris agreement. The Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels; and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C. Each country must determine, plan, and regularly report on the contribution that it undertakes to mitigate global warming. Climate change mitigation measures can be written down in national environmental policy documents like the nationally determined contributions (NDC).\n\nThe Paris agreement succeeds the 1997 Kyoto Protocol which expires in 2020, and is an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Countries that ratified the Kyoto protocol committed to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases, or engage in emissions trading if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases.\n\nHow well each individual country is on track to achieving its Paris agreement commitments can be followed on-line.\n\nExcept the main agreements there are many additional pledges made by international coalitions, countries, cities, regions and businesses. According to a report published in september 2019 before the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit, full implementation of all pledges, including those in the Paris Agreement, will be sufficient to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees but not to 1.5 degrees. After the report was published, additional pledges were made in the september climate summit and in december of that year. \n\nAll the information about the pledges is collected and analyzed in the Global Climate Action (portal), what is facilitating to the scientific community to check their fulfillment\n\nHuman activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0 °C of global warming above\npre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8 °C to 1.2 °C. \nThere is disagreement among experts over whether or not the 2 °C target can be met.\n\nIn 2015, two official UNFCCC scientific expert bodies came to the conclusion that, \"in some regions and vulnerable ecosystems, high risks are projected even for warming above 1.5 °C\". This expert position was, together with the strong diplomatic voice of the poorest countries and the island nations in the Pacific, the driving force leading to the decision of the Paris Conference 2015, to lay down this 1.5 °C long-term target on top of the existing 2 °C goal.\n\nAn emissions tax on greenhouse gas emissions requires emitters to pay a fee, charge or tax for every tonne of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere. Most environmentally related taxes with implications for greenhouse gas emissions in OECD countries are levied on energy products and motor vehicles, rather than on CO emissions directly. As such, non-transport sectors as the agricultural sector which produces large amounts of methane are typically left untaxed by current policies. Also, revenue of the emissions taxes are not always used to offset the emissions directly.\n\nEmission taxes can be both cost-effective and environmentally effective. Difficulties with emission taxes include their potential unpopularity, and the fact that they cannot guarantee a particular level of emissions reduction. Emissions or energy taxes also often fall disproportionately on lower income classes. In developing countries, institutions may be insufficiently developed for the collection of emissions fees from a wide variety of sources.\n\nAnother indirect method of encouraging uses of renewable energy, and pursue sustainability and environmental protection, is that of prompting investment in this area through legal means, something that is already being done at national level as well as in the field of international investment.\n\nAlthough state policies tackling climate change are seen as a threat to investors, so is global warming itself. As well as a policy risk, Ernst and Young identify physical, secondary, liability, transitional and reputation-based risks. Therefore, it is increasingly seen to be in the interest of investors to accept climate change as a real threat which they must proactively and independently address.\n\nWith the creation of a market for trading carbon dioxide emissions within the Kyoto Protocol, it is likely that London financial markets will be the centre for this potentially highly lucrative business; the New York and Chicago stock markets may have a lower trade volume than expected as long as the US maintains its rejection of the Kyoto.\n\nHowever, emissions trading may delay the phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nIn the north-east United States, a successful cap and trade program has shown potential for this solution.\n\nThe European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is the largest multi-national, greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world. It commenced operation on 1 January 2005, and all 28 member states of the European Union participate in the scheme which has created a new market in carbon dioxide allowances estimated at 35 billion Euros (US$43 billion) per year. The Chicago Climate Exchange was the first (voluntary) emissions market, and is soon to be followed by Asia's first market (Asia Carbon Exchange). A total of 107 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent have been exchanged through projects in 2004, a 38% increase relative to 2003 (78 Mt COe).\n\nTwenty three multinational corporations have come together in the G8 Climate Change Roundtable, a business group formed at the January 2005 World Economic Forum. The group includes Ford, Toyota, British Airways, and BP. On 9 June 2005 the Group published a statement stating that there was a need to act on climate change and claiming that market-based solutions can help. It called on governments to establish \"clear, transparent, and consistent price signals\" through \"creation of a long-term policy framework\" that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases.\n\nThe Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is a proposed carbon trading scheme being created by nine North-eastern and Mid-Atlantic American states; Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. The scheme was due to be developed by April 2005 but has not yet been completed.\n\nImplementation puts into effect climate change mitigation strategies and targets. These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.\n\nFunding, such as the Green Climate Fund, is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues. The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which land degradation and persistent organic pollutant were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.\n\nIt has been estimated that only 0.12% of all funding for climate-related research is spent on the social science of climate change mitigation. Vastly more funding is spent on natural science studies of climate change and considerable sums are also spent on studies of impact of and adaptation to climate change. It has been argued that this is a misallocation of resources, as the most urgent puzzle at the current juncture is to work out how to change human behavior to mitigate climate change, whereas the natural science of climate change is already well established and there will be decades and centuries to handle adaptation.\n\nThere are numerous issues which result in a current perceived lack of implementation. It has been suggested that the main barriers to implementation are Uncertainty, Fragmentation, Institutional void, Short time horizon of policies and politicians and Missing motives and willingness to start adapting. The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation. The issues that arise with a system which involves international government cooperation, such as cap and trade, could potentially be improved with a polycentric approach where the rules are enforced by many small sections of authority as opposed to one overall enforcement agency. Concerns about metal requirement and/or availability for essential decarbonization technoloqies such as photovoltaics, nuclear power, and (plug-in hybrid) electric vehicles have also been expressed as obstacles.\n\nDespite a perceived lack of occurrence, evidence of implementation is emerging internationally. Some examples of this are the initiation of NAPA's and of joint implementation. Many developing nations have made National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPAs) which are frameworks to prioritize adaption needs. The implementation of many of these is supported by GEF agencies. Many developed countries are implementing 'first generation' institutional adaption plans particularly at the state and local government scale. There has also been a push towards joint implementation between countries by the UNFCCC as this has been suggested as a cost-effective way for objectives to be achieved.\n\nAlthough not designed for this purpose, the Montreal Protocol has benefited climate change mitigation efforts. The Montreal Protocol is an international treaty that has successfully reduced emissions of ozone-depleting substances (for example, CFCs), which are also greenhouse gases.\n\nMany countries are aiming for net zero emissions, and many have either carbon taxes or carbon emission trading.\n\nEfforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the United States include energy policies which encourage efficiency through programs like Energy Star, Commercial Building Integration, and the Industrial Technologies Program. \n\nIn the absence of substantial federal action, state governments have adopted emissions-control laws such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeast and the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 in California. In 2019 a new climate change bill was introduced in Minnesota. One of the targets, is making all the energy of the state carbon free, by 2030.\n\nAs to 2019, China implements more than 100 policies to fight climate change. China said in the Paris Agreement that its emission will begin to fall by 2030, but it will possibly occur by 2026. This can position China as a leader on the issue because it is the biggest emitter of GHG emissions, so if it really reduces them, the significance will be large.\n\nThe climate commitments of the European Union are divided into 3 main categories: targets for the year 2020, 2030 and 2050. The European Union claim that his policies are in line with the goal of the Paris Agreement.\n\nTargets for the year 2020:\n\n\n\n\nTargets for the year 2030:\n\n\n\nTargets for the year 2050:\n\n\nImplementation:\n\nThe European Union claims that he has already achieved the 2020 target for emission reduction and have the legislation needed to achieve the 2030 targets. Already in 2018, its GHG emissions were 23% lower that in 1990.\n\nNew Zealand made significant pledges on climate change mitigation in the year 2019: reduce emissions to zero by 2050, plant 1 billion trees by 2028, and made high taxes on farmers who will not reduce emissions in 2025. Already in 2019 New Zealand banned new offshore oil and gas drilling and decided the climate change issues will be examined before every important decision.\n\nIn order to reconcile economic development with mitigating carbon emissions, developing countries need particular support, both financial and technical. One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The World Bank's Prototype Carbon Fund is a public private partnership that operates within the CDM.\n\nAn important point of contention, however, is how overseas development assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation. One of the outcomes of the UNFCC Copenhagen Climate Conference was the Copenhagen Accord, in which developed countries promised to provide US$30 million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources. Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the European Commission has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have found four main understandings:\nThe main point being that there is a conflict between the OECD states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important Millennium Development Goals.\n\nHowever, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, UNEP and WTO urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the Doha trade round \"which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services\".\n\nIn 2019 week of climate action in Latin America and the Caribbean result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and \"sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the rainforest fires in the Amazon region, underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change\".\n\nWhile many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and businesses can also play a part in the mitigation effort.\n\nEnvironmental groups encourage individual action against global warming, often aimed at the consumer. Common recommendations include lowering home heating and cooling usage, burning less gasoline, supporting renewable energy sources, buying local products to reduce transportation, turning off unused devices, and various others.\n\nA geophysicist at Utrecht University has urged similar institutions to hold the vanguard in voluntary mitigation, suggesting the use of communications technologies such as videoconferencing to reduce their dependence on long-haul flights.\n\nIn 2008, climate scientist Kevin Anderson raised concern about the growing effect of rapidly increasing global air transport on the climate in a paper, and a presentation, suggesting that reversing this trend is necessary to reduce emissions.\n\nPart of the difficulty is that when aviation emissions are made at high altitude, the climate impacts are much greater than otherwise. Others have been raising the related concerns of the increasing hypermobility of individuals, whether traveling for business or pleasure, involving frequent and often long distance air travel, as well as air shipment of goods.\n\nClimate change is also a concern for large institutional investors who have a long term time horizon and potentially large exposure to the negative impacts of global warming because of the large geographic footprint of their multi-national holdings. Socially responsible investing funds allow investors to invest in funds that meet high ESG (environmental, social, governance) standards as such funds invest in companies that are aligned with these goals. Proxy firms can be used to draft guidelines for investment managers that take these concerns into account.\n\nIn some countries, those affected by climate change may be able to sue major producers. Attempts at litigation have been initiated by entire peoples such as Palau and the Inuit, as well as non-governmental organizations such as the Sierra Club. Although proving that particular weather events are due specifically to global warming may never be possible, methodologies have been developed to show the increased risk of such events caused by global warming.\n\nFor a legal action for negligence (or similar) to succeed, \"Plaintiffs ... must show that, more probably than not, their individual injuries were caused by the risk factor in question, as opposed to any other cause. This has sometimes been translated to a requirement of a relative risk of at least two.\" Another route (though with little legal bite) is the World Heritage Convention, if it can be shown that climate change is affecting World Heritage Sites like Mount Everest.\n\nBesides countries suing one another, there are also cases where people in a country have taken legal steps against their own government. Legal action for instance has been taken to try to force the US Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, and against the Export-Import Bank and OPIC for failing to assess environmental impacts (including global warming impacts) under NEPA.\n\nIn the Netherlands and Belgium, organisations such as the foundation Urgenda and the vzw Klimaatzaak in Belgium have also sued their governments as they believe their governments aren't meeting the emission reductions they agreed to. Urgenda have already won their case against the Dutch government.\n\nAccording to a 2004 study commissioned by Friends of the Earth, ExxonMobil, and its predecessors caused 4.7 to 5.3 percent of the world's man-made carbon dioxide emissions between 1882 and 2002. The group suggested that such studies could form the basis for eventual legal action.\n\nIn 2015, Exxon received a subpoena. According to the \"Washington Post\" and confirmed by the company, the attorney general of New York, Eric Schneiderman, opened an investigation into the possibility that the company had misled the public and investors about the risks of climate change. In October 2019 begun the trial. Massachusetts sued Exxon also, for hiding the impact of climate change.\n\nIn 2019, 22 states, six cities and Washington DC in United States, sued the Trump administration for blocking the repealing of Clean power plan.\n\nEnvironmental organizations organize different actions such as Peoples Climate Marches and Divestment from fossil fuels. 1,000 organizations with a worth of 8 trillion dollars, made commitments to divest from fossil fuel to 2018. Another form of action is climate strike. In January 2019 12,500 students marched in Brussels demanding Climate action. In 2019 The organization Extinction Rebellion organized massive protests demanding \"tell the truth about climate change, reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress\", including blocking roads. Many were arrested. In many cases, activism brings positive results.\n\nA major event was the global climate strike in September 2019 organized by Fridays For Future and Earth Strike. The target was to influence the climate action summit organized by the UN on September 23. According to the organizers four million people participated in the strike on September 20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Topological manifolds form an important class of topological spaces with applications throughout mathematics. All manifolds are topological manifolds by definition, but many manifolds may be equipped with additional structure (e.g. differentiable manifolds are topological manifolds equipped with a differential structure). Every manifold has an \"underlying\" topological manifold, obtained by simply \"forgetting\" any additional structure the manifold has.\n\nA topological space \"X\" is called locally Euclidean if there is a non-negative integer \"n\" such that every point in \"X\" has a neighbourhood which is homeomorphic to real \"n\"-space R.\n\nA topological manifold is a locally Euclidean Hausdorff space. It is common to place additional requirements on topological manifolds. In particular, many authors define them to be paracompact or second-countable.\n\nIn the remainder of this article a \"manifold\" will mean a topological manifold. An \"n-manifold\" will mean a topological manifold such that every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R.\n\n\n\n\nThe property of being locally Euclidean is preserved by local homeomorphisms. That is, if \"X\" is locally Euclidean of dimension \"n\" and \"f\" : \"Y\" → \"X\" is a local homeomorphism, then \"Y\" is locally Euclidean of dimension \"n\". In particular, being locally Euclidean is a topological property.\n\nManifolds inherit many of the local properties of Euclidean space. In particular, they are locally compact, locally connected, first countable, locally contractible, and locally metrizable. Being locally compact Hausdorff spaces, manifolds are necessarily Tychonoff spaces.\n\nAdding the Hausdorff condition can make several properties become equivalent for a manifold. As an example, we can show that for a Hausdorff manifold, the notions of σ-compactness and second-countability are the same. Indeed, a Hausdorff manifold is a locally compact Hausdorff space, hence it is (completely) regular. Assume such a space X is σ-compact. Then it is Lindelöf, and because Lindelöf + regular implies paracompact, X is metrizable. But in a metrizable space, second-countability coincides with being Lindelöf, so X is second-countable. Conversely, if X is a Hausdorff second-countable manifold, it must be σ-compact.\n\nA manifold need not be connected, but every manifold \"M\" is a disjoint union of connected manifolds. These are just the connected components of \"M\", which are open sets since manifolds are locally-connected. Being locally path connected, a manifold is path-connected if and only if it is connected. It follows that the path-components are the same as the components.\n\nThe Hausdorff property is not a local one; so even though Euclidean space is Hausdorff, a locally Euclidean space need not be. It is true, however, that every locally Euclidean space is T.\n\nAn example of a non-Hausdorff locally Euclidean space is the line with two origins. This space is created by replacing the origin of the real line with \"two\" points, an open neighborhood of either of which includes all nonzero numbers in some open interval centered at zero. This space is not Hausdorff because the two origins cannot be separated.\n\nA manifold is metrizable if and only if it is paracompact. Since metrizability is such a desirable property for a topological space, it is common to add paracompactness to the definition of a manifold. In any case, non-paracompact manifolds are generally regarded as pathological. An example of a non-paracompact manifold is given by the long line. Paracompact manifolds have all the topological properties of metric spaces. In particular, they are perfectly normal Hausdorff spaces.\n\nManifolds are also commonly required to be second-countable. This is precisely the condition required to ensure that the manifold embeds in some finite-dimensional Euclidean space. For any manifold the properties of being second-countable, Lindelöf, and σ-compact are all equivalent.\n\nEvery second-countable manifold is paracompact, but not vice versa. However, the converse is nearly true: a paracompact manifold is second-countable if and only if it has a countable number of connected components. In particular, a connected manifold is paracompact if and only if it is second-countable. \nEvery second-countable manifold is separable and paracompact. Moreover, if a manifold is separable and paracompact then it is also second-countable.\n\nEvery compact manifold is second-countable and paracompact.\n\nBy invariance of domain, a non-empty \"n\"-manifold cannot be an \"m\"-manifold for \"n\" ≠ \"m\". The dimension of a non-empty \"n\"-manifold is \"n\". Being an \"n\"-manifold is a topological property, meaning that any topological space homeomorphic to an \"n\"-manifold is also an \"n\"-manifold.\n\nBy definition, every point of a locally Euclidean space has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of R. Such neighborhoods are called Euclidean neighborhoods. It follows from invariance of domain that Euclidean neighborhoods are always open sets. One can always find Euclidean neighborhoods that are homeomorphic to \"nice\" open sets in R. Indeed, a space \"M\" is locally Euclidean if and only if either of the following equivalent conditions holds:\nA Euclidean neighborhood homeomorphic to an open ball in R is called a Euclidean ball. Euclidean balls form a basis for the topology of a locally Euclidean space.\n\nFor any Euclidean neighborhood \"U\", a homeomorphism φ : \"U\" → φ(\"U\") ⊂ R is called a coordinate chart on \"U\" (although the word \"chart\" is frequently used to refer to the domain or range of such a map). A space \"M\" is locally Euclidean if and only if it can be covered by Euclidean neighborhoods. A set of Euclidean neighborhoods that cover \"M\", together with their coordinate charts, is called an atlas on \"M\". (The terminology comes from an analogy with cartography whereby a spherical globe can be described by an atlas of flat maps or charts).\n\nGiven two charts φ and ψ with overlapping domains \"U\" and \"V\", there is a transition function\nSuch a map is a homeomorphism between open subsets of R. That is, coordinate charts agree on overlaps up to homeomorphism. Different types of manifolds can be defined by placing restrictions on types of transition maps allowed. For example, for differentiable manifolds the transition maps are required to be diffeomorphisms.\n\nA 0-manifold is just a discrete space. A discrete space is second-countable if and only if it is countable.\n\nEvery nonempty, paracompact, connected 1-manifold is homeomorphic either to R or the circle.\n\nEvery nonempty, compact, connected 2-manifold (or surface) is homeomorphic to the sphere, a connected sum of tori, or a connected sum of projective planes. \n\nA classification of 3-manifolds results from\nThurston's geometrization conjecture, proven by Grigori Perelman in 2003. More specifically, Perelman's results provide an algorithm for deciding if two three-manifolds are homeomorphic to each other. \n\nThe full classification of \"n\"-manifolds for \"n\" greater than three is known to be impossible; it is at least as hard as the word problem in group theory, which is known to be algorithmically undecidable.\n\nIn fact, there is no algorithm for deciding whether a given manifold is simply connected. There is, however, a classification of simply connected manifolds of dimension ≥ 5.\n\nA slightly more general concept is sometimes useful. A topological manifold with boundary is a Hausdorff space in which every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of Euclidean half-space (for a fixed \"n\"):\n\nEvery topological manifold is a topological manifold with boundary, but not vice versa.\n\nThere are several methods of creating manifolds from other manifolds.\n\nIf \"M\" is an \"m\"-manifold and \"N\" is an \"n\"-manifold, the Cartesian product \"M\" × \"N\" is a (\"m\"+\"n\")-manifold when given the product topology.\n\nThe disjoint union of a countable family of \"n\"-manifolds is a \"n\"-manifold (the pieces must all have the same dimension).\n\nThe connected sum of two \"n\"-manifolds is defined by removing an open ball from each manifold and taking the quotient of the disjoint union of the resulting manifolds with boundary, with the quotient taken with regards to a homeomorphism between the boundary spheres of the removed balls. This results in another \"n\"-manifold.\n\nAny open subset of an \"n\"-manifold is an \"n\"-manifold with the subspace topology. \n\n"}

In this world, Cortez changed sides at the onset of the Conquistador era in the early 16th century, leading to the repulsion of Spanish invasion and occupation of Central America. Due to fortuitously strong central leadership, the Aztec Empire has become a technologically sophisticated global power in this alternate 20th century.\n\nThroughout the novel, hints are dropped as to how the timeline differs from our own, though often from the perspective of Aztec officials with an accompanying spin. The Aztec Empire adopts Christianity in the seventeenth century; an Anglo-French alliance led by Napoleon, the Duke of Wellington and Andrew Jackson temporarily halts Aztec ambitions in North America with a victory at New Orleans in 1815.

{"id": "2119219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2119219", "title": "Differentiable manifold", "text": "Differentiable manifold\n\nIn mathematics, a differentiable manifold (also differential manifold) is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus. Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas. One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply. If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.\n\nIn formal terms, a differentiable manifold is a topological manifold with a globally defined differential structure. Any topological manifold can be given a differential structure \"locally\" by using the homeomorphisms in its atlas and the standard differential structure on a linear space. To induce a global differential structure on the local coordinate systems induced by the homeomorphisms, their composition on chart intersections in the atlas must be differentiable functions on the corresponding linear space. In other words, where the domains of charts overlap, the coordinates defined by each chart are required to be differentiable with respect to the coordinates defined by every chart in the atlas. The maps that relate the coordinates defined by the various charts to one another are called \"transition maps.\"\n\nDifferentiability means different things in different contexts including: continuously differentiable, \"k\" times differentiable, smooth, and holomorphic. Furthermore, the ability to induce such a differential structure on an abstract space allows one to extend the definition of differentiability to spaces without global coordinate systems. A differential structure allows one to define the globally differentiable tangent space, differentiable functions, and differentiable tensor and vector fields. Differentiable manifolds are very important in physics. Special kinds of differentiable manifolds form the basis for physical theories such as classical mechanics, general relativity, and Yang–Mills theory. It is possible to develop a calculus for differentiable manifolds. This leads to such mathematical machinery as the exterior calculus. The study of calculus on differentiable manifolds is known as differential geometry.\n\nThe emergence of differential geometry as a distinct discipline is generally credited to Carl Friedrich Gauss and Bernhard Riemann. Riemann first described manifolds in his famous habilitation lecture before the faculty at Göttingen. He motivated the idea of a manifold by an intuitive process of varying a given object in a new direction, and presciently described the role of coordinate systems and charts in subsequent formal developments:\n\nThe works of physicists such as James Clerk Maxwell, and mathematicians Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita led to the development of tensor analysis and the notion of covariance, which identifies an intrinsic geometric property as one that is invariant with respect to coordinate transformations. These ideas found a key application in Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity and its underlying equivalence principle. A modern definition of a 2-dimensional manifold was given by Hermann Weyl in his 1913 book on Riemann surfaces. The widely accepted general definition of a manifold in terms of an atlas is due to Hassler Whitney.\n\nA topological n-manifold is a topological space formula_1 which satisfies the following three conditions:\nSo a topological manifold is a certain kind of topological space; if one is presented with a topological space, it is meaningful to ask whether or not it is a topological manifold. By contrast, the various kinds of differentiable manifolds, as defined below, are not \"certain kinds\" of topological manifold; instead, they endow a given topological manifold with an additional structure. This \"additional structure\" is the specification of certain distinguished charts, as defined below.\n\nA \"chart\" on a topological space formula_1 is an open subset formula_5 together with a homeomorphism from formula_6 to an open subset of formula_7 a collection of charts whose domains cover formula_1 is called an atlas. The third condition in the above definition of a topological manifold could be phrased in this terminology as saying \"an atlas exists\".\n\nThe composition of one chart with the inverse of another chart is a function called a 'transition map', and is automatically a continuous map (and even a homeomorphism) from one open subset of formula_9 to another.\n\nThe following defines some common types of atlases:\n\nIn the following four paragraphs, for convenience we will consider only smooth atlases. Everything would remain true if one replaced the word \"smooth\" everywhere it appears with either \"holomorphic,\" \"analytic,\" or \"\"C\".\"\n\nIf one is given a smooth atlas and some other chart on the topological manifold, one says that the chart is smooth (implicitly speaking relative to the given atlas) if its transition maps with each element of the atlas are smooth. Alternatively, one would say that the chart is \"compatible\" with the atlas. \n\nIn practice, if one is explicitly dealing with atlases, the number of charts involved is often quite small - often even as few as two or three. However, for abstract purposes, it can be useful to consider the \"maximal\" smooth atlas defined by a given smooth atlas, which consists of the given atlas together with all charts which are compatible with it.\n\nA smooth \"n\"-manifold is a topological \"n\"-manifold together with a maximal smooth atlas.\n\nA maximal atlas is always enormous; for instance, if it contains a chart formula_13 then it necessarily also contains the restriction of formula_14 to every open subset of formula_15 An alternative definition, which can be more appropriate in certain practical circumstances, is to say that a smooth \"n\"-manifold is a topological \"n\"-manifold together with an equivalence class of smooth atlases, in which two smooth atlases are considered equivalent if every chart of one atlas is compatible with the other atlas. Informally, what this means is that in dealing with a smooth manifold, one can work with a topological manifold together with a smooth atlas consisting of only a few charts, with the implicit understanding that many other charts are equally legitimate.\n\nHere we provide common notation and the formal definitions which appear in the above discussion. We will use the smooth context for convenience; one could replace the word \"smooth\" everywhere it appears with one of \"\"C\",\" \"analytic,\" or \"holomorphic.\"\n\nLet \"M\" be a topological \"n\"-manifold. A \"chart\" on \"M\" consists of an open subset \"U\" of \"M\" and a homeomorphism φ from \"U\" to an open subset of \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space. An \"atlas\" on \"M\" consists of an indexing set \"A\" and a collection of charts formula_16 such that the union of the domains \"U\" is \"M\". (One says that {\"U\"} \"cover\" \"M\".)\n\nThe transition maps of the atlas are the functions\nfor every choice formula_18 provided only that formula_19 is nonempty.\n\nOne says that an atlas is smooth if all of its transition maps are smooth. For the remainder of this section, we will consider \n\nOne says that two smooth atlases on the same topological manifold are compatible if their union remains a smooth atlas. It is straightforward to check that this defines an equivalence relation on the collection of all smooth atlases.\n\nA smooth \"n\"-manifold consists of a topological \"n\"-manifold together with an equivalence class of smooth atlases. In particular, a given smooth atlas on a topological \"n\"-manifold \"defines\" a smooth \"n\"-manifold.\n\nFor an alternative definition, one says that a smooth atlas is maximal if it contains as a subset every smooth atlas that it is compatible with. A smooth \"n\"-manifold can then be considered as a topological \"n\"-manifold together with a maximal smooth atlas.\n\nSince any holomorphic function is analytic, and any analytic function is smooth, and any smooth function is formula_20 for any formula_21 one can immediately conclude that any holomorphic atlas can be considered, in a natural way, as an analytic atlas; any analytic atlas can be considered as a smooth atlas, and any smooth atlas can be considered as a \"C\" atlas for any \"k\".\n\nTaking this only one step further, any complex \"n\"-manifold can be considered, naturally, as an analytic 2\"n\"-manifold; an analytic \"n\"-manifold can be considered as a smooth \"n\"-manifold, and a smooth \"n\"-manifold can be considered as a \"C\" \"n\"-manifold for any \"k\".\n\nHowever, since there exist (for instance) smooth functions between open subsets of formula_10 which are not holomorphic when considered as mappings between open subsets of formula_23 the converse is not automatically true. There are some subtleties in addressing this properly; the issue is discussed at greater length in the article on differential structure. \n\nOne can reverse-engineer the above definitions to obtain one perspective on the construction of manifolds. The idea is to start with the images of the charts and the transition maps, and to construct the manifold purely from this data. As in the above discussion, we use the \"smooth\" context but everything works just as well in other settings.\n\nGiven an indexing set formula_24 let formula_25 be a collection of open subsets of formula_9 and for each formula_27 let formula_28 be an open (possibly empty) subset of formula_29 and let formula_30 be a smooth map. Suppose that formula_31 is the identity map, that formula_32 is the identity map, and that formula_33 is the identity map. Then define an equivalence relation on the disjoint union formula_34 by declaring formula_35 to be equivalent to formula_36 With some technical work, one can show that the set of equivalence classes can naturally be given a topological structure, and that the charts used in doing so form a smooth atlas.\n\nThe notion of a pseudogroup provides a flexible generalization of atlases in order to allow a variety of different structures to be defined on manifolds in a uniform way. A \"pseudogroup\" consists of a topological space \"S\" and a collection Γ consisting of homeomorphisms from open subsets of \"S\" to other open subsets of \"S\" such that\nThese last three conditions are analogous to the definition of a group. Note that Γ need not be a group, however, since the functions are not globally defined on \"S\". For example, the collection of all local \"C\" diffeomorphisms on R form a pseudogroup. All biholomorphisms between open sets in C form a pseudogroup. More examples include: orientation preserving maps of R, symplectomorphisms, Möbius transformations, affine transformations, and so on. Thus, a wide variety of function classes determine pseudogroups.\n\nAn atlas (\"U\", \"φ\") of homeomorphisms \"φ\" from to open subsets of a topological space \"S\" is said to be \"compatible\" with a pseudogroup Γ provided that the transition functions are all in Γ.\n\nA differentiable manifold is then an atlas compatible with the pseudogroup of \"C\" functions on R. A complex manifold is an atlas compatible with the biholomorphic functions on open sets in C. And so forth. Thus, pseudogroups provide a single framework in which to describe many structures on manifolds of importance to differential geometry and topology.\n\nSometimes, it can be useful to use an alternative approach to endow a manifold with a \"C\"-structure. Here \"k\" = 1, 2, ..., ∞, or ω for real analytic manifolds. Instead of considering coordinate charts, it is possible to start with functions defined on the manifold itself. The structure sheaf of \"M\", denoted C, is a sort of functor that defines, for each open set , an algebra C(\"U\") of continuous functions . A structure sheaf C is said to give \"M\" the structure of a \"C\" manifold of dimension \"n\" provided that, for any , there exists a neighborhood \"U\" of \"p\" and \"n\" functions such that the map is a homeomorphism onto an open set in R, and such that C| is the pullback of the sheaf of \"k\"-times continuously differentiable functions on R.\n\nIn particular, this latter condition means that any function \"h\" in C(\"V\"), for \"V\", can be written uniquely as , where \"H\" is a \"k\"-times differentiable function on \"f\"(\"V\") (an open set in R). Thus, the sheaf-theoretic viewpoint is that the functions on a differentiable manifold can be expressed in local coordinates as differentiable functions on R, and \"a fortiori\" this is sufficient to characterize the differential structure on the manifold.\n\nA similar, but more technical, approach to defining differentiable manifolds can be formulated using the notion of a ringed space. This approach is strongly influenced by the theory of schemes in algebraic geometry, but uses local rings of the germs of differentiable functions. It is especially popular in the context of \"complex\" manifolds.\n\nWe begin by describing the basic structure sheaf on R. If \"U\" is an open set in R, let\nconsist of all real-valued \"k\"-times continuously differentiable functions on \"U\". As \"U\" varies, this determines a sheaf of rings on R. The stalk O for consists of germs of functions near \"p\", and is an algebra over R. In particular, this is a local ring whose unique maximal ideal consists of those functions that vanish at \"p\". The pair is an example of a locally ringed space: it is a topological space equipped with a sheaf whose stalks are each local rings.\n\nA differentiable manifold (of class \"C\") consists of a pair where \"M\" is a second countable Hausdorff space, and O is a sheaf of local R-algebras defined on \"M\", such that the locally ringed space is locally isomorphic to . In this way, differentiable manifolds can be thought of as schemes modelled on R. This means that for each point , there is a neighborhood \"U\" of \"p\", and a pair of functions , where\n\nThere are a number of important motivations for studying differentiable manifolds within this abstract framework. First, there is no \"a priori\" reason that the model space needs to be R. For example, (in particular in algebraic geometry), one could take this to be the space of complex numbers C equipped with the sheaf of holomorphic functions (thus arriving at the spaces of complex analytic geometry), or the sheaf of polynomials (thus arriving at the spaces of interest in complex \"algebraic\" geometry). In broader terms, this concept can be adapted for any suitable notion of a scheme (see topos theory). Second, coordinates are no longer explicitly necessary to the construction. The analog of a coordinate system is the pair , but these merely quantify the idea of \"local isomorphism\" rather than being central to the discussion (as in the case of charts and atlases). Third, the sheaf O is not manifestly a sheaf of functions at all. Rather, it emerges as a sheaf of functions as a \"consequence\" of the construction (via the quotients of local rings by their maximal ideals). Hence, it is a more primitive definition of the structure (see synthetic differential geometry).\n\nA final advantage of this approach is that it allows for natural direct descriptions of many of the fundamental objects of study to differential geometry and topology.\n\nA real valued function \"f\" on an \"n\"-dimensional differentiable manifold \"M\" is called differentiable at a point if it is differentiable in any coordinate chart defined around \"p\". In more precise terms, if formula_39 is a differentiable chart where formula_6 is an open set in formula_1 containing \"p\" and formula_42 is the map defining the chart, then \"f\" is differentiable at \"p\" if and only if\nis differentiable at formula_44, that is \"f\" is a differentiable function from the open set formula_45, considered as a subset of formula_46, to formula_47. In general, there will be many available charts; however, the definition of differentiability does not depend on the choice of chart at \"p\". It follows from the chain rule applied to the transition functions between one chart and another that if \"f\" is differentiable in any particular chart at \"p\", then it is differentiable in all charts at \"p\". Analogous considerations apply to defining \"C\" functions, smooth functions, and analytic functions.\n\nThere are various ways to define the derivative of a function on a differentiable manifold, the most fundamental of which is the directional derivative. The definition of the directional derivative is complicated by the fact that a manifold will lack a suitable affine structure with which to define vectors. Therefore, the directional derivative looks at curves in the manifold instead of vectors.\n\nGiven a real valued function \"f\" on an \"n\" dimensional differentiable manifold \"M\", the directional derivative of \"f\" at a point \"p\" in \"M\" is defined as follows. Suppose that γ(\"t\") is a curve in \"M\" with , which is \"differentiable\" in the sense that its composition with any chart is a differentiable curve in R. Then the directional derivative of \"f\" at \"p\" along γ is\n\nIf \"γ\" and \"γ\" are two curves such that , and in any coordinate chart \"φ\",\n\nthen, by the chain rule, \"f\" has the same directional derivative at \"p\" along \"γ\" as along \"γ\". This means that the directional derivative depends only on the tangent vector of the curve at \"p\". Thus, the more abstract definition of directional differentiation adapted to the case of differentiable manifolds ultimately captures the intuitive features of directional differentiation in an affine space.\n\nA tangent vector at is an equivalence class of differentiable curves \"γ\" with , modulo the equivalence relation of first-order contact between the curves. Therefore,\n\nin every coordinate chart \"φ\". Therefore, the equivalence classes are curves through \"p\" with a prescribed velocity vector at \"p\". The collection of all tangent vectors at \"p\" forms a vector space: the tangent space to \"M\" at \"p\", denoted \"T\"\"M\".\n\nIf \"X\" is a tangent vector at \"p\" and \"f\" a differentiable function defined near \"p\", then differentiating \"f\" along any curve in the equivalence class defining \"X\" gives a well-defined directional derivative along \"X\":\nOnce again, the chain rule establishes that this is independent of the freedom in selecting γ from the equivalence class, since any curve with the same first order contact will yield the same directional derivative.\n\nIf the function \"f\" is fixed, then the mapping\nis a linear functional on the tangent space. This linear functional is often denoted by \"df\"(\"p\") and is called the differential of \"f\" at \"p\":\n\nLet formula_1 be a topological formula_55-manifold with a smooth atlas formula_56 Given formula_57 let formula_58 denote formula_59 A \"tangent vector at formula_57\" is a mapping formula_61 here denoted formula_62 such that\nfor all formula_64 Let the collection of tangent vectors at formula_65 be denoted by formula_66 Given a smooth function formula_67, define formula_68 by sending a tangent vector formula_69 to the number given by\nwhich due to the chain rule and the constraint in the definition of a tangent vector does not depend on the choice of formula_71\n\nOne can check that formula_72 naturally has the structure of a formula_55-dimensional real vector space, and that with this structure, formula_74 is a linear map. The key observation is that, due to the constraint appearing in the definition of a tangent vector, the value of formula_75 for a single element formula_76 of formula_58 automatically determines formula_78 for all formula_79\n\nThe above formal definitions correspond precisely to a more informal notation which appears often in textbooks, specifically\nWith the idea of the formal definitions understood, this shorthand notation is, for most purposes, much easier to work with.\n\nOne of the topological features of the sheaf of differentiable functions on a differentiable manifold is that it admits partitions of unity. This distinguishes the differential structure on a manifold from stronger structures (such as analytic and holomorphic structures) that in general fail to have partitions of unity.\n\nSuppose that \"M\" is a manifold of class \"C\", where . Let {\"U\"} be an open covering of \"M\". Then a partition of unity subordinate to the cover {\"U\"} is a collection of real-valued \"C\" functions \"φ\" on \"M\" satisfying the following conditions:\n(Note that this last condition is actually a finite sum at each point because of the local finiteness of the supports of the \"φ\".)\n\nEvery open covering of a \"C\" manifold \"M\" has a \"C\" partition of unity. This allows for certain constructions from the topology of \"C\" functions on R to be carried over to the category of differentiable manifolds. In particular, it is possible to discuss integration by choosing a partition of unity subordinate to a particular coordinate atlas, and carrying out the integration in each chart of R. Partitions of unity therefore allow for certain other kinds of function spaces to be considered: for instance L spaces, Sobolev spaces, and other kinds of spaces that require integration.\n\nSuppose \"M\" and \"N\" are two differentiable manifolds with dimensions \"m\" and \"n\", respectively, and \"f\" is a function from \"M\" to \"N\". Since differentiable manifolds are topological spaces we know what it means for \"f\" to be continuous. But what does \"\"f\" is \" mean for ? We know what that means when \"f\" is a function between Euclidean spaces, so if we compose \"f\" with a chart of \"M\" and a chart of \"N\" such that we get a map that goes from Euclidean space to \"M\" to \"N\" to Euclidean space we know what it means for that map to be . We define \"\"f\" is \" to mean that all such compositions of \"f\" with charts are . Once again, the chain rule guarantees that the idea of differentiability does not depend on which charts of the atlases on \"M\" and \"N\" are selected. However, defining the derivative itself is more subtle. If \"M\" or \"N\" is itself already a Euclidean space, then we don't need a chart to map it to one.\n\nThe tangent space of a point consists of the possible directional derivatives at that point, and has the same dimension \"n\" as does the manifold. For a set of (non-singular) coordinates \"x\" local to the point, the coordinate derivatives formula_83 define a holonomic basis of the tangent space. The collection of tangent spaces at all points can in turn be made into a manifold, the tangent bundle, whose dimension is 2\"n\". The tangent bundle is where tangent vectors lie, and is itself a differentiable manifold. The Lagrangian is a function on the tangent bundle. One can also define the tangent bundle as the bundle of 1-jets from R (the real line) to \"M\".\n\nOne may construct an atlas for the tangent bundle consisting of charts based on , where \"U\" denotes one of the charts in the atlas for \"M\". Each of these new charts is the tangent bundle for the charts \"U\". The transition maps on this atlas are defined from the transition maps on the original manifold, and retain the original differentiability class.\n\nThe dual space of a vector space is the set of real valued linear functions on the vector space. The cotangent space at a point is the dual of the tangent space at that point, and the cotangent bundle is the collection of all cotangent spaces.\n\nLike the tangent bundle, the cotangent bundle is again a differentiable manifold. The Hamiltonian is a scalar on the cotangent bundle. The total space of a cotangent bundle has the structure of a symplectic manifold. Cotangent vectors are sometimes called \"covectors\". One can also define the cotangent bundle as the bundle of 1-jets of functions from \"M\" to R.\n\nElements of the cotangent space can be thought of as infinitesimal displacements: if \"f\" is a differentiable function we can define at each point \"p\" a cotangent vector \"df\", which sends a tangent vector \"X\" to the derivative of \"f\" associated with \"X\". However, not every covector field can be expressed this way. Those that can are referred to as exact differentials. For a given set of local coordinates \"x,\" the differentials \"dx\" form a basis of the cotangent space at \"p\".\n\nThe tensor bundle is the direct sum of all tensor products of the tangent bundle and the cotangent bundle. Each element of the bundle is a tensor field, which can act as a multilinear operator on vector fields, or on other tensor fields.\n\nThe tensor bundle is not a differentiable manifold in the traditional sense, since it is infinite dimensional. It is however an algebra over the ring of scalar functions. Each tensor is characterized by its ranks, which indicate how many tangent and cotangent factors it has. Sometimes these ranks are referred to as \"covariant\" and \"contravariant\" ranks, signifying tangent and cotangent ranks, respectively.\n\nA frame (or, in more precise terms, a tangent frame), is an ordered basis of particular tangent space. Likewise, a tangent frame is a linear isomorphism of R to this tangent space. A moving tangent frame is an ordered list of vector fields that give a basis at every point of their domain. One may also regard a moving frame as a section of the frame bundle F(\"M\"), a principal bundle made up of the set of all frames over \"M\". The frame bundle is useful because tensor fields on \"M\" can be regarded as equivariant vector-valued functions on F(\"M\").\n\nOn a manifold that is sufficiently smooth, various kinds of jet bundles can also be considered. The (first-order) tangent bundle of a manifold is the collection of curves in the manifold modulo the equivalence relation of first-order contact. By analogy, the \"k\"-th order tangent bundle is the collection of curves modulo the relation of \"k\"-th order contact. Likewise, the cotangent bundle is the bundle of 1-jets of functions on the manifold: the \"k\"-jet bundle is the bundle of their \"k\"-jets. These and other examples of the general idea of jet bundles play a significant role in the study of differential operators on manifolds.\n\nThe notion of a frame also generalizes to the case of higher-order jets. Define a \"k\"-th order frame to be the \"k\"-jet of a diffeomorphism from R to \"M\". The collection of all \"k\"-th order frames, \"F\"(\"M\"), is a principal \"G\" bundle over \"M\", where \"G\" is the group of \"k\"-jets; i.e., the group made up of \"k\"-jets of diffeomorphisms of R that fix the origin. Note that is naturally isomorphic to \"G\", and a subgroup of every \"G\", . In particular, a section of \"F\"(\"M\") gives the frame components of a connection on \"M\". Thus, the quotient bundle is the bundle of \"symmetric\" linear connections over \"M\".\n\nMany of the techniques from multivariate calculus also apply, \"mutatis mutandis\", to differentiable manifolds. One can define the directional derivative of a differentiable function along a tangent vector to the manifold, for instance, and this leads to a means of generalizing the total derivative of a function: the differential. From the perspective of calculus, the derivative of a function on a manifold behaves in much the same way as the ordinary derivative of a function defined on a Euclidean space, at least locally. For example, there are versions of the implicit and inverse function theorems for such functions.\n\nThere are, however, important differences in the calculus of vector fields (and tensor fields in general). In brief, the directional derivative of a vector field is not well-defined, or at least not defined in a straightforward manner. Several generalizations of the derivative of a vector field (or tensor field) do exist, and capture certain formal features of differentiation in Euclidean spaces. The chief among these are:\n\nIdeas from integral calculus also carry over to differential manifolds. These are naturally expressed in the language of exterior calculus and differential forms. The fundamental theorems of integral calculus in several variables—namely Green's theorem, the divergence theorem, and Stokes' theorem—generalize to a theorem (also called Stokes' theorem) relating the exterior derivative and integration over submanifolds.\n\nDifferentiable functions between two manifolds are needed in order to formulate suitable notions of submanifolds, and other related concepts. If is a differentiable function from a differentiable manifold \"M\" of dimension \"m\" to another differentiable manifold \"N\" of dimension \"n\", then the differential of \"f\" is a mapping . It is also denoted by \"Tf\" and called the tangent map. At each point of \"M\", this is a linear transformation from one tangent space to another:\nThe rank of \"f\" at \"p\" is the rank of this linear transformation.\n\nUsually the rank of a function is a pointwise property. However, if the function has maximal rank, then the rank will remain constant in a neighborhood of a point. A differentiable function \"usually\" has maximal rank, in a precise sense given by Sard's theorem. Functions of maximal rank at a point are called immersions and submersions:\n\n\nA Lie derivative, named after Sophus Lie, is a derivation on the algebra of tensor fields over a manifold \"M\". The vector space of all Lie derivatives on \"M\" forms an infinite dimensional Lie algebra with respect to the Lie bracket defined by\n\nThe Lie derivatives are represented by vector fields, as infinitesimal generators of flows (active diffeomorphisms) on \"M\". Looking at it the other way around, the group of diffeomorphisms of \"M\" has the associated Lie algebra structure, of Lie derivatives, in a way directly analogous to the Lie group theory.\n\nThe exterior calculus allows for a generalization of the gradient, divergence and curl operators.\n\nThe bundle of differential forms, at each point, consists of all totally antisymmetric multilinear maps on the tangent space at that point. It is naturally divided into \"n\"-forms for each \"n\" at most equal to the dimension of the manifold; an \"n\"-form is an \"n\"-variable form, also called a form of degree \"n\". The 1-forms are the cotangent vectors, while the 0-forms are just scalar functions. In general, an \"n\"-form is a tensor with cotangent rank \"n\" and tangent rank 0. But not every such tensor is a form, as a form must be antisymmetric.\n\nThere is a map from scalars to covectors called the exterior derivative\nsuch that \n\nThis map is the one that relates covectors to infinitesimal displacements, mentioned above; some covectors are the exterior derivatives of scalar functions. It can be generalized into a map from the \"n\"-forms onto the (\"n\"+1)-forms. Applying this derivative twice will produce a zero form. Forms with zero derivative are called closed forms, while forms that are themselves exterior derivatives are known as exact forms.\n\nThe space of differential forms at a point is the archetypal example of an exterior algebra; thus it possesses a wedge product, mapping a \"k\"-form and \"l\"-form to a -form. The exterior derivative extends to this algebra, and satisfies a version of the product rule:\n"}
{"id": "2119223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2119223", "title": "Backward bending supply curve of labour", "text": "Backward bending supply curve of labour\n\nIn economics, a backward-bending supply curve of labour, or backward-bending labour supply curve, is a graphical device showing a situation in which as real (inflation-corrected) wages increase beyond a certain level, people will substitute leisure (non-paid time) for paid worktime and so higher wages lead to a decrease in the labour supply and so less labour-time being offered for sale. \n\nThe \"labour-leisure\" tradeoff is the tradeoff faced by wage-earning human beings between the amount of time spent engaged in wage-paying work (assumed to be unpleasant) and satisfaction-generating unpaid time, which allows participation in \"leisure\" activities and the use of time to do necessary self-maintenance, such as sleep. The key to the tradeoff is a comparison between the wage received from each hour of working and the amount of satisfaction generated by the use of unpaid time.\n\nSuch a comparison generally means that a higher wage entices people to spend more time working for pay; the substitution effect implies a positively sloped labour supply curve. However, the backward-bending labour supply curve occurs when an even higher wage actually entices people to work less and consume more leisure or unpaid time.\n\nAs wages increase above the subsistence level (discussed below), there are two considerations affecting a worker's choice of how many hours to work per unit of time (usually day, week, or month). The first is the substitution or incentive effect. With wages rising, the tradeoff between working an additional hour for pay and taking one extra hour of unpaid time changes in favor of working. Thus, more hours of labour-time will be offered at the higher wage than the lower one. The second and countervailing effect is that the hours worked at the old wage rate now all gain more income than before, creating an income effect, which encourages more leisure to be chosen because it is more affordable. Most economists assume that unpaid time (or \"leisure\") is a normal good and so people want more of it as their incomes (or wealth) rise. Since a rising wage rate raises incomes, all else constant, the attraction of unpaid time rises, eventually neutralising the substitution effect and causing the backward bend. \n\nThe graph shows that if real wages were to increase from W1 to W2, the substitution effect for an individual worker outweighs the income effect; therefore, the worker would be willing to increase hours worked for pay from L1 to L2. However, if the real wage increased from W2 to W3, the number of hours offered to work for pay would fall from L2 to L3 since the strength of the income effect now exceeds that of the substitution effect; the utility to be gained from an extra hour of unpaid time is now greater than the utility to be gained from extra income that could be earned by working the extra hour. \n\nThe above examines only the effect of changing wage rates on workers already subject to those rates; only those individuals' labour supply response was considered. The additional labour supplied by workers working in other sectors (or unemployed), who are now more attracted to the jobs in the sector because it is paying higher wages, was not considered. Thus, for a given market, the wage at which the labour supply curve bends backward may be higher than the wage at which a given worker's curve bends back.\n\nOn the other hand, for the \"aggregate\" labour market, a labour market without \"other sectors\" for workers, the original story of the backward-bending labour-supply curve applies except that some workers suffer from involuntary unemployment.\n\nIt is essential to understand that with the supply curve of labour, there must be assumptions set which takes the curve's inevitable backward bending form. The assumptions for the theory of labour supply are listed as follows:\n\n\nAt very low wage levels, near the subsistence level, the supply curve may also be curved backwards for a completely different reason. That effect creates an \"inverted S\" or \"backward S\" shape: a tail is added at the bottom of the labour-supply curve shown in the graph above with the quantity of labour-time supplied falling as wages rise. Then, because families face some minimum level of income needed to meet their subsistence requirements, lowering wages \"increases\" the amount of labour-time offered for sale. Similarly, a rise in wages can cause a decrease in the amount of labour-time offered for sale, and individuals take advantage of the higher wage to spend time on needed self- or family-maintenance activities.\n\n"}

It was groundbreaking in that it was the first widely advertised seminar organized by a predominantly gay volunteer organization which dealt with homosexuality in a scientific and balanced manner. Any previous public talk had to avoid portraying homosexuality as normal, or else the police would not issue a license to allow it to proceed.\n\nHeld from 19–22 August 2003 at the Raffles City Convention Centre, it was hosted and co-organised by the National University of Singapore's Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. It drew over 1000 participants from around the world, almost all of whom were academics. Over 900 papers were presented. The conference was a landmark in that its programme included the most papers touching on sexuality and transgend issues ever assembled in Singapore. The 60-80 queer scholars who flew in for the conference were the largest group of queer academics meeting at a local venue at the same time.\n\nMany felt that the theme of sexuality and transgenderism fielded more papers than any other, such as IndoChinese history or modern Chinese politics. Altogether 10 panels (each with about 4 papers) discussed topics on sexuality and transgenderism. They were: \nSome of the academics from Australia and other Western countries had wondered, before the conference, whether their papers would be accepted, considering that the conference was to be held in Singapore, and the NUS would play a big part in its organisation. Academic and activist Russell Heng felt they need not have worried as NUS had actually pitched for it.\n\nHeld from 25–28 November 2003 by the Singapore chapter of the controversial US-linked organisation Focus on the Family. This despite the organisers having received protest letters and a statement issued by the AFFIRM Network, a US-based group of psychologists, which highlighted \"serious ethical and scientific concerns\" about \"reparative therapy\" for gays and lesbians. The letter listed three \"serious problems\" which the Singaporean public should have been made aware of if they were considering attending at the event. Recipients of the letter included \"The Straits Times\", the Singapore Psychological Society, the California Psychological Association Ethics Committee and Melvin Wong, Ph.D., the California-based speaker of the seminars. The series of seminars, which was supported by the Metropolitan YMCA, the YMCA of Singapore, the Salvation Army, the Boys' Brigade and the State-run and funded National Council of Social Service (NCCS), covered topics such as \"Preventing Homosexuality\", \"Recovery Therapy\" and \"Unwanted Homosexuality: Steps to Early Detection and Prevention\". People Like Us (PLU) had also sent a different set of letters to the NCCS, the Ministry of Community Development, volunteer organisations and the media highlighting that the claims purported by the seminar's organisers were contrary to the opinions of the mainstream medical community. One of the main points of contention was that voluntary welfare organisations were eligible to receive a 70% training grant from the NCCS if they attended, according to the seminar brochure. The NCCS subsequently withdrew its previously-offered training grant to participants on the grounds of the speaker, Dr. Melvin Wong's lack of qualifications.\n\nIn March 2004, The Fun Stage, a theatre group, applied to the Public Entertainment Licensing Unit (PELU), which is under the Singapore Police Force and handles the licensing of public lectures and forums, for permits to hold three talks at SPACE 21, 21 Tanjong Pagar Road. These were to be lead-up events to their play \"Lovers' Words\", scheduled for mid-April 2004. The 3 talks entitled the \"Lovers' Lecture Series\" were meant for academics, arts practitioners and critics. Its scheduled programmed was as follows:\n\nA forum held on 29 March 2004, organised by the National University of Singapore Society (NUSS) at Kent Ridge Guild Hall. The main speaker was activist Alex Au who argued that resolving the question of whether the State should be regulating the sexual choices of consenting adults depended on whether the State was a paternalistic or liberal one. In the former case, the State's default tendency was to regulate, and one would have to present positive reasons for it not to. The opposite applied in the liberal paradigm. Au used the example of homosexuality to show how weak the arguments for regulating sexual behaviour in a liberal context were, even for such a contentious issue. The other speaker was Associate Professor Michael Hor, Faculty of Law, NUS who dissected section 377 and section 377A of the Penal Code, discussed some pertinent cases and also delved into constitutional principles involved. He touched on the reasoning used by the US Supreme Court in the Lawrence vs Texas case, and how such reasoning might apply in Singapore's constitutional provisions.\n\n\nHeld on Tuesday, 1 March 2005, it was the first workshop organised by Oogachaga-Looking Glass, the non-profit lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and straight affirming counseling service. This was part of regular personal development and growth workshops for lesbians, gays and their friends which were to take place on the first Tuesday of every other month in 2005.\n\nClarence Singam and Eileena Lee shared their own journeys of growth into self acceptance and affirmation. Eileena and Clarence shared the lessons they learned about being human, being strong, finding empathy and learning to love from their unique and yet common journeys. They shared their ups and downs, their self rejections, their own healing and the celebration of their selfhoods. The sharing was followed by a question and answer session, to engage Eileena and Clarence further.\n\nA dialogue held on Saturday, 12 March 2005 as part of an event curated by Ong Keng Sen of Theatreworks, under the umbrella of the National Arts Council-funded Singapore Season. It took place at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, UK. PLU3's Alex Au was one of the panelists at the dialogue.\n\nHeld on Tuesday, 3 May 2005, the second in the series of Oogachaga-Looking Glass workshops. A panel of 3 gay persons (Kok Wei, Dominic Chua and Eileena Lee), 2 mothers and 2 brothers shared their journey of coming home to each other. What were the challenges they faced when they found out their family members were gay? What made these three gay persons share their lives as gay people to their families? If they could do it all over again, would they? How would they do it differently?\n\nHeld on Tuesday, 5 July 2005, the third in the series of Oogachaga workshops.\n\nIt explored the multitude of challenges, from a lack of role models and social support to dealing with one's own and one's partner's hangups. Questions tackled were: What makes a healthy relationship? How does one deal with trials that pop up in every relationship? How does one negotiate one's relationship commitments? What sacrifices does one have to make to maintain a relationship? How does one's biological families fit in, if at all? A panel of gay and lesbian persons shared the ups & downs and joys & sorrows of their relationships. Speaker Kim shared the twists and turns of his 20-year partnership with Leong. Jo and Jorg talked about their long distance stint and why they decided to get married after a 10-year partnership. The panelists shared the lessons they learned about being human, being strong, finding empathy and learning to love from their unique and yet common journeys.\n\nSexualities, Genders and Rights in Asia was organised by the Australian National University and Mahidol University and held in Bangkok, Thailand from 7–9 July 2005. The conference had difficulties raising funds because many donors had been exhausted by the recent tsunami relief effort. Furthermore, many of them also had policies where their contributions should be linked to health issues. This made it hard for the conference to include thematic streams that dealt with identity and representation not connected with HIV/AIDS. Singapore's People Like Us 3 rendered financial assistance which made possible the \"Cinema and Media\" thematic stream, in particular the panel on Asian Queer Filmmakers, by funding scholarships for speakers from poorer countries who would present papers on this subject. Fridae was also another proud Singaporean sponsor of the conference. Over 200 papers were presented, including studies by Singaporean and Singapore-based researchers.\n\nIn August 2005, gay activists, bolstered by broad-based grassroots support organised Singapore's inaugural month-long gay pride celebration called IndigNation. The latter moniker was a clever play of words representing the gay community's displeasure at the unexpected official ban of the annual Nation mega-parties which had been approved and held without incident 4 years in a row prior to 2005.\n\nThe first talk of the \"festival\" was delivered in Mandarin by Dr. Tan Chong Kee to a capacity audience at 7:30pm on 2 August 2005 at Xposé Café, Bar and Restaurant. Its management allowed free use of the premises to conduct the historic event, namely, the first widely advertised talk on homosexuality, open to all and held in a public indoor venue ever to take place in Singapore since Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's 2004 liberalisation of the rules governing public talks in indoor areas. Dr. Tan, who had conducted extensive research into Chinese civilization, challenged the notion that same-sex love was contrary to Asian culture. He traced and explored various ancient classical Chinese texts to demonstrate that same-sex love had been an integral part of Asian life.\n"}

His entire county cricket career was spent with Somerset, spanning the period between 1975 and 1989. Marks also played for Oxford University whilst a student and had one season playing in Western Australia, winning the Sheffield Shield 1986–87.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Marks became a cricket journalist. He writes match reports and opinion pieces for \"The Guardian\" and \"The Observer\" newspapers, and frequently appears on BBC Radio's \"Test Match Special\" as a summariser.\n\nMarks was born on 25 June 1955 in Middle Chinnock, Somerset. He was educated at Blundell's School and Oxford University, for whom he played cricket between 1975 and 1978 (alongside Imran Khan and Chris Tavaré, and opposite Peter Roebuck of Cambridge University, subsequently Marks' captain at Somerset). Marks captained Oxford University in 1976 and 1977.\n\nMarks made his first-class debut for Somerset in the 1975 County Championship. Five years later he made his debut for the national team, in an ODI against the West Indies. His Test debut was in 1982 against Pakistan.\n\nHe went on to play six Test matches, and was an important member of the ODI squad during the 1980s, appearing thirty four times and taking forty four wickets at a bowling average of 25.79. His haul of five for 20 for England against New Zealand in 1984 was, for some years, England's best bowling return in One Day Internationals; it remains the best one-day figures by an England spin bowler. Marks was the first England bowler to take two ODI five-wicket hauls (having previously taken five wickets against Sri Lanka in 1983). This feat was subsequently emulated by the seam bowlers Darren Gough, Mark Ealham and Andrew Flintoff; the first spin bowler to equal Marks' record was Adil Rashid in 2019.\n\nMarks had a distinguished first-class career between 1975 and 1989 for Somerset. He also played a season for Western Australia in the 1986–87 season, winning the Sheffield Shield. In 342 first-class matches he took 859 wickets at 33.28, and scored 12,419 runs at a batting average of 30.29.\n\nAs a cricketer he was popular and well-liked; \"Wisden\" editor, Matthew Engel, labelled him \"a mild, nervy, self-deprecating farm boy with an Oxford degree and no enemies\". This was an unusual distinction in the Somerset side of the 1980s, where three explosive personalities, Viv Richards, Joel Garner and Ian Botham, had a dispute with captain Peter Roebuck, which resulted in Somerset (under the influence from Roebuck and new club Secretary Tony Brown) opting not to renew Richards' and Garner's contracts in 1986, and Botham leaving the club in protest.\n\nThe cricket correspondent Colin Bateman noted that \"in typical self-deprecating style, Vic Marks entitled one of his books, \"Marks Out of XI\". He was probably out of the England XI slightly too often. While he was never a fashionable cricketer, he was a determined and highly effective off-spinner-cum-batsman whose Test figures stand comparison with those often picked ahead of him, such as Geoff Miller and Eddie Hemmings\".\n\nAfter retiring as a professional cricketer, he turned his hand to journalism and broadcasting, and is now a regular summariser on \"Test Match Special\". He writes regularly about cricket and occasionally rugby union for \"The Observer\" newspaper as their Cricket Correspondent, and also for \"The Guardian\".\n\nHe is currently Chairman of Cricket at Somerset.\n"}

Joseph Buckminster, Buckminster was a precocious child. He learned Latin and the Greek New Testament at age four, entered Harvard College at 13, and graduated in 1800 at age 16 with both bachelor's and master's degrees. Upon his graduation, he spent two years as an instructor at Phillips Exeter Academy. In 1805 he became minister of the Brattle Street Church in Boston, and quickly launched an almost legendary career of eloquent preaching, biblical scholarship, and literary production which set the tone for the pattern of the minister as a man of letters.\n\nDuring 1806-07 he traveled through Europe and collected a library of 3000 volumes that would become the foundation of the library of the Boston Athenæum. Buckminster was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1809. He was the most brilliant member of the Anthology Club, an early editor of the Monthly Anthology, and in 1811 was appointed Dexter Lecturer at Harvard where he occupied the first Chair in Scripture.\n\nBuckminster died in June 1812.\n\nBuckminster's influence on his contemporaries was striking. His mastery of the emerging \"New Criticism\" from German Biblical scholars led to his rational investigation of the Bible, subjecting its text to the same scrupulous scholarly investigation given other texts from antiquity. This approach heavily influenced William Ellery Channing, and gave rise to the first section of Channing's 1819 \"Baltimore Sermon\" for the ordination of the Rev. Jared Sparks. Buckminster further convinced the young Edward Everett to study for the ministry instead of the law.\n\n\n"}

It is the state butterfly of Tennessee. Its distinctive wing shape and long tails make it easy to identify, and its black-and-white-striped pattern is reminiscent of a zebra. The butterflies are closely associated with pawpaws, and are rarely found far from these trees. The green or black caterpillars feed on the leaves of various pawpaw species, while the adults feed on flower nectar and minerals from damp soil.\n\nThe zebra swallowtail has a wingspan of . The triangular wings are white to greenish white with black longitudinal stripes. A pair of swordlike tails extend from the hindwings. The inner margin of the hindwing has two blue spots on the corner and a red spot near the body. A red stripe runs along the middle of the ventral hindwing. \"P. marcellus\" has two seasonal forms, one occurring in the spring and the other in the summer. Spring forms are smaller, more white, and have short, black tails with white tips. Summer forms are larger, have broader black stripes, and longer, black tails with white edges.\n\nThe zebra swallowtail can be seen from late March to August in the northern portion of its range and from February to December in the southern portion. It has two broods in the north and three to four in the south, with the first brood being the most numerous.\n\nMales will patrol near host plants in search of females, flying swiftly and directly. They usually fly 0.5 to 1.8 meters (2 to 6 ft) above the ground. Females will fly slowly when searching for suitable host plants. Both males and females avidly visit flowers, including species from the families Apocynaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Lythraceae, Polemoniaceae, and Rosaceae. Males participate in a behavior known as puddling, in which individuals congregate on sand, gravel, or moist soil to obtain salts and amino acids. These nutrients aid the male in reproduction. Other food sources include rotting fruit and urine.\n\nSince the caterpillars are cannibalistic, females lay their eggs singly on pawpaw leaves or on the tree trunks. The round egg is pale green, later turning orange brown. Young caterpillars are black with lighter colored transverse stripes. Older larvae have two color forms. The more common form is green with yellow and white transverse stripes; the rarer form is black and banded with white and orange. In both forms, between the swollen thorax and the abdomen, there is a yellow, black, and bluish-white band. The larva has a yellow, foul-smelling, forked gland called an osmeterium which it will use to deter predators, especially spiders and ants. The chrysalis is either green or brown, and is more compact compared to chrysalids in the genus \"Papilio\". Three small horns project from the head and thorax. The chrysalis hibernates in areas of its range with cold winters.\n\nThe zebra swallowtail caterpillar feeds only on species within the genus \"Asimina\". Commonly used species include \"A. angustifolia\" (slimleaf pawpaw), \"A. incana\" (woolly pawpaw), \"A. parviflora\" (smallflower pawpaw), \"A. reticulata\" (netted pawpaw), \"A. tetramera\" (four-petal pawpaw), and \"A. triloba\" (common pawpaw). \"P. marcellus\" caterpillars ingest chemicals called annonaceous acetogenins from their host plants, which are retained in the body tissues of both the caterpillar and the adult, and may help chemically protect the butterfly from birds.\n\n\n"}

They signed to TVT Records after getting positive reviews from their live shows and recorded their debut album \"LP\" in March 23, 2004 in the US and March 14, 2005 in the UK and went on to sell more than 100,000 copies worldwide.\n\nThe band mixes the genres of dream pop, indie rock and the British shoegazing movement of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Their influences range from The Beatles and The Rolling Stones to Spiritualized, My Bloody Valentine, and Elliott Smith. The band has said that \"their niche is not sticking to any particular niche\" and that they do not want to be stuck in any subgenre of rock.\n\nAn EP titled \"New English EP\" was released in March 2006.\n\nAfter the defection of keyboardist Andrew Haskell shortly before their debut LP was released on TVT/Island, Matthew Dublin and Darren Beckett also left Ambulance LTD to form a band called The Red Romance with the addition of Adam Chilensk on bass, leaving Congleton as the only remaining member.

The region that the Diocese comprises extends from its northern border on the south shore of Lake Ontario through the Finger Lakes region to its southern border at the New York-Pennsylvania border.\n\nThe Diocese of Rochester comprises 12 counties in New York, with approximately 350,000 Catholics and over 125 faith communities (parishes and chapels), 22 diocesan elementary schools and 7 independent parochial high schools. The bishop of the diocese is currently Salvatore Ronald Matano. The metropolitan for the diocese is the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, currently Cardinal Timothy Dolan. The cathedral parish for the diocese is Sacred Heart Cathedral.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester began on March 3, 1868, when Pope Pius IX entrusted eight counties (Monroe, Livingston, Wayne, Ontario, Seneca, Cayuga, Yates, and Tompkins) within the Diocese of Buffalo to Bernard J. McQuaid, the first bishop of Rochester. The new diocese had about 54,500 Catholics in 35 parish churches and 29 mission churches.\n\nIn 1896, the counties of Schuyler, Tioga, Chemung, and Steuben were added to the Diocese of Rochester from the Diocese of Buffalo, forming the current boundaries.\n\nThe diocese grew as Catholic immigrants came to western New York, peaking in the 1960s. Since then, the Catholic population has stabilized while the numbers of ordained presbyters (priests) and religious sisters has fallen.\n\nOn September 22, 2017, the Diocese of Rochester inaugurated its sesquicentennial anniversary marked by a solemn Mass at Sacred Heart Cathedral. This event marks a year long celebration of the 150 year anniversary and the year of the Eucharist which was proclaimed by Bishop Salvatore Matano on the Feast of Corpus Christi.\n\nIn June 2018, it was revealed that the Diocese had secretly paid $1.6 million since 1950 in compensation to 20 sex abuse victims. Most of the payments occurred after the eruption of the 2002 clergy sex abuse scandal, although some are decades old. On June 10, 2019, a man claiming that he had been molested between 1969 and 1971 by local priest Rev. Francis Vogt filed a lawsuit against the Diocese of Rochester and several other local Catholic organizations affiliated the Diocese, claiming that they shielded Vogt from potential prosecution. On September 12, 2019, the Diocese filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in the wake of lawsuits against priests and other ministers who served in the Diocese. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester is the first Catholic diocese in the state of New York to file for bankruptcy and also the 20th Catholic diocese in the U.S. to do so.\n\nOn May 4, 2020, it was revealed that attorneys for sex abuse plaintiffs forced the Diocese of Rochester to turn over approximately 43,000 documents in exchange for delaying the sex abuse lawsuits. However, it remains to be seen if the released documents are complete.\n\nThe following are lists of bishops and their years of service:\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, as Catholic populations moved to the suburbs, the Diocese has closed parishes and their schools.

{"id": "2119332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2119332", "title": "Le Corsaire", "text": "Le Corsaire\n\nLe Corsaire is a ballet typically presented in three acts, with a libretto originally created by Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges loosely based on the poem \"The Corsair\" by Lord Byron. Originally choreographed by Joseph Mazilier to the music of Adolphe Adam, it was first presented by the ballet of the Théâtre Impérial de l’Opéra in Paris on 23 January 1856. All modern productions of \"Le Corsaire\" are derived from the revivals staged by the Ballet Master Marius Petipa for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg throughout the mid to late 19th century.\n\nThe ballet has many celebrated passages which are often excerpted from the full-length work and performed independently: the scene \"Le Jardin animé\", the \"Pas d’esclave\", the \"Pas de trois des odalisques\", and the so-called \"Le Corsaire pas de deux\", which is among classical ballet's most famous and performed excerpts.\n\n\"Le Corsaire\" was created primarily for the talents of the famous Italian ballerina Carolina Rosati, who was then the Opéra's reigning \"Prima ballerina\". The role of Conrad—which contained no dancing in Mazilier's original staging—was created by the Italian Domenico Segarelli. Although he was an accomplished dancer, it was Segarelli's abilities as a mime artist that won him the many roles he created on the stage of the Opéra. It would not be until many years later that the role of Conrad included any dancing.\n\n\"Le Corsaire\" was first staged in Russia for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg by Jules Perrot, who served as \"Premier Maître de Ballet\" of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres from 1849 until 1858. \"Le Corsaire\" was performed for the first time on at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, with the \"Prima ballerina\" Ekaterina Friedbürg as the heroine Medora, and the young Marius Petipa as the corsair Conrad. For this production Petipa assisted Perrot in rehearsals, and even revised a few of the ballet's key dances.\n\nOver the course of his long career Petipa presented four revivals of \"Le Corsaire\", each time adding a substantial number of new \"pas\", variations and incidental dances. His first revival was staged especially for his wife, the \"Prima Ballerina\" Maria Surovshchikova-Petipa, with the \"Premier danseur\" Christian Johansson as Conrad. The production premiered on , and included a score supplemented and revised by the composer Cesare Pugni. For this revival, Petipa also extracted a pas de deux, the Pas d'esclave, from Duke Peter Oldenbourg's score to Petipa's ballet \"La Rose, la violette et le papillon\".\n\nFour years later Joseph Mazilier came out of retirement to mount a revival of \"Le Corsaire\" in honor of the 1867 Exposition Universelle, given that year in Paris. The celebrated German ballerina Adèle Grantzow performed the role of Medora, while Adolphe Adam's former pupil Léo Delibes composed new music for a \"Pas des fleurs\" especially for Grantzow. The revival premiered on 21 October 1867 and was given thirty-eight performances with Grantzow as the heroine Medora. After the ballerina's departure from Paris in 1868, \"Le Corsaire\" was removed from the Opéra's repertory, never to be performed by the Parisian ballet again.\n\nIn the winter of 1867, Granztow was invited to perform with the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg by Emperor Alexander II. For her début, Petipa staged a revival of \"Le Corsaire\", which was given for the first time on . For the production Petipa again called upon Cesare Pugni to compose music for new dances.\n\nPetipa's third revival of \"Le Corsaire\" was staged especially for the Russian Ballerina Eugeniia Sokolova, given for the first time on .\n\nPetipa's final and most important revival of \"Le Corsaire\" premiered on , at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. This production was mounted especially for the benefit performance of Pierina Legnani, \"Prima ballerina assoluta\" of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The \"Prima ballerina\" Olga Preobrajenskaya performed the role of Gulnare, and the Imperial Theatre's \"Premier danseur\" Pavel Gerdt performed the role of Conrad.\n\nIn March 1858 Marius Petipa was dispatched to mount Jules Perrot's version of \"Le Corsaire\" for the Ballet of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre (today known as the Bolshoi Ballet), who continued performing the ballet with some regularity for many years in various revivals. In 1888 Petipa supervised the creation of a new production of \"Le Corsaire\" for the company, which premiered to a resounding success. Petipa was a leading choreographer of the time in Russia. In 1894 the Bolshoi Theatre's newly appointed Ballet Master Ivan Clustine mounted his staging of \"Le Corsaire\", which premiered on . Petipa would later allege that Clustine's production apparently plagiarised much of his own choreography, particularly for the scene \"Le jardin animé\".\nOn Alexander Gorsky, \"Premier Maître de Ballet\" of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre, presented his revival of \"Le Corsaire\", with Ekaterina Geltzer as Medora and Vasily Tikhomirov as Conrad. For this revival Gorsky supervised a substantially revised edition of Adam's score that included a myriad of new dances. The airs of such composers as Edvard Grieg, Anton Simon, Reinhold Glière, Karl Goldmark, Frédéric Chopin, Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Antonín Dvořák were fashioned into \"dansante\" accompaniment for new scenes, \"pas\", variations, and the like. Among the most notable scenes added by Gorsky was a dream sequence set to a \"Nocturne\" by Chopin, in which the character Medora dreams of her beloved Conrad. Another interpolation of note was a \"divertissement\" for Turkish, Persian and Arabian slave-women that took place during the scene in the bazaar of the first act. Even with the production's large number of interpolated pieces, Gorsky chose to retain many of the additional \"pas\" as included in the ballet by Mazilier and Petipa.\n\nGorsky's revival of \"Le Corsaire\" remained in the repertory of the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre until 1927. Although the company regularly performed extracts from \"Le Corsaire\" for many years thereafter, the full-length work was not given again until Konstantin Sergeyev staged his version for the company in 1992.\n\nOn 21 June 2007 the Bolshoi Ballet presented a lavish revival of \"Le Corsaire\" staged by Yuri Burlaka and the company's director Alexei Ratmansky. Burlaka utilized the choreographic notation of the Sergeyev Collection, as well as materials found in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the Bakhrushin Theater Museum and the St. Petersburg State Museum of Theatre and Music to assist in mounting a historically informed production. This version of \"Le Corsaire\" proved to be the most expensive production of a ballet ever mounted, estimated at $1.5 million USD.\n\nPetipa's 1899 revival of \"Le Corsaire\", which was given its final production in 1915, remained in the repertory of the Mariinsky Theatre until 1928 (after the 1917 Russian Revolution the ballet company was known as the \"State Petrograd Ballet\", and later the \"State Academic Ballet\", before it was renamed the \"Kirov Ballet\"). By 1928 \"Le Corsaire\" had been performed 224 times since 1899 at the Mariinsky Theatre.\n\nAgrippina Vaganova, the revered pedagogue of Russian Ballet, supervised the first noted post-revolution revival of \"Le Corsaire\" for the Kirov Ballet, first performed on 15 May 1931 (Mikhail Dudko as Conrad). In 1936 another revival of \"Le Corsaire\" was given by the Kirov Ballet, with Natalia Dudinskaya as Medora, Mikhail Mikhailov as Conrad, and Vakhtang Chabukiani as the Slave (or Rhab, as the character was known in Russia). This was the first production of the full-length work to include Vaganova's 1931 revision of \"Le Corsaire pas de deux\" as staged for Dudinskaya's graduation performance. Over time, Konstantin Sergeyev, artistic director and chief choreographer of the Kirov Ballet from 1951–1955 and 1960–1970, added various new pieces. From 1941 the production was only given on rare occasions until it was totally removed from the repertory in 1956.\n\nThe ballet master Pyotr Gusev staged a new version of \"Le Corsaire\" for the Maly Theatre Ballet of Leningrad in 1955. This production used a modified version of the original libretto, written by Gusev and the ballet historian Yuri Slonimsky.\n\nGusev called upon the conductor Eugene Kornblit to fashion a new score for his production. Although the ballet master retained the traditional interpolations as handed down from Petipa's Imperial-era productions, he discarded nearly all of Adam's original 1856 score in favor of music fashioned from passages lifted from Adam's 1840 ballet \"L′Écumeur de mer\" (\"The Pirate\") and his 1852 opera \"Si j’étais roi\". With this new music, leitmotifs were created for the ballet's main characters.\n\nA new character was also included—known as the slave Ali—a role which evolved out of the Slave who took part in \"Le Corsaire pas de deux\" in early Soviet productions of the full-length work at the Mariinsky Theatre.\nGusev's revival premiered on 31 May 1955, and went on to become the most popular version of \"Le Corsaire\" in Russia. In 1977 the director of the Kirov Ballet, Oleg Vinogradov staged Gusev's version for the company, who still retain the production in their repertory. The Novosibirsk Ballet also includes Gusev's version in their repertory. In 2009 the Mikhailovsky Theatre Ballet staged Gusev's version as revised by artistic director of ballet, Farouk Ruzimatov.\n\nThe Kirov Ballet's staging of Gusev's version of \"Le Corsaire\" was given a new production in 1989 for the company's engagement at New York's Metropolitan Opera House. A performance of the new production was filmed that same year at the Mariinsky Theatre with the ballerina Altynai Asylmuratova as Medora, Yevgeny Neff as Conrad, Konstantin Zaklinsky as Isaac Lankendem, Yelena Pankova as Gulnare, and Farouk Ruzimatov as Ali. This film has been released onto DVD/video.\n\nIn 1973, the ballet master of the Kirov Ballet, Konstantin Sergeyev, staged his own version of \"Le Corsaire\" that included new pieces and updated choreography. Sergeyev included a new variation for the characters Conrad and Birbanto in Act I, fashioned from themes taken from Adam's original score.\n\nSergeyev's revival was pulled from the Kirov Ballet's repertory after only nine performances. It has been said that the Ballet Master had fallen into disfavor with the Soviet government due to the recent defections from the U.S.S.R. of Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov, events which caused his dismissal from the post of \"artistic director\" in 1970.\n\nThe full-length \"Le Corsaire\" was not performed again by the Kirov Ballet until 1977, when Oleg Vinogradov (the Kirov Ballet's artistic director from 1977) staged Pyotr Gusev's 1955 version. In 1989 the Kirov Ballet decided to present a revival of \"Le Corsaire\" for its upcoming world tour. There was much debate as to whether Vinogradov's staging of Gusev's version would be retained or whether Sergeyev's version would be reinstated. In the end the company chose to retain the Gusev version, which the company still performs regularly.\n\nIn 1992 Yuri Grigorovich, director of the Bolshoi Ballet of Moscow, invited Sergeyev to mount his 1973 revival of \"Le Corsaire\" for the company. This production—which included a heavily re-edited and re-orchestrated score by the Bolshoi Theatre's conductor Alexander Sotnikov—premiered on 11 March 1992 to great success, but after only seven performances Grigorovich decided to pull the production from the repertory. After witnessing the success of Sergeyev's production, Grigorovich decided to stage his own version, which premiered on 16 February 1994. Grigorovich's production was then taken out of the repertory after the director left the company in 1995.\n\nThe sets and costumes designed by Irina Tibilova for Konstantin Sergeyev's 1992 Moscow production sat unused in the archives of the Bolshoi Theatre for almost five years. At the suggestion of Sergeyev's wife, Natalia Dudinskaya, Anna-Marie Holmes staged Sergeyev's 1992 production for the Boston Ballet (with the assistance of Dudinskaya, Tatiana Terekhova, Sergei Berezhnoi, Tatiana Legat, and Vadim Disnitsky).\n\nNearly one year later, the American Ballet Theatre rented the Boston Ballet's production of \"Le Corsaire\". The staging went through even more revisions both choreographically and musically, with modifications performed by American Ballet Theatre conductor Charles Barker and the company pianist Henrietta Stern.\n\nOn 26 January 2006, the Bayerisches Staatsballett (Bavarian State Ballet) presented a partial reconstruction of Petipa's 1899 revival of \"Le Corsaire\" with additional choreography by Ivan Liska. For this production, twenty-five of Petipa's original dances were reconstructed from the Stepanov Choreographic Notation of the Sergeyev Collection by Doug Fullington. Modifications of the music-score by Maria Babanina. Set and costumes: Roger Kirk.\n\nOn 21 June 2007 the Bolshoi Ballet presented a lavish revival of Petipa's \"Le Corsaire\" staged by Alexei Ratmansky with new choreography, which included some reconstructed elements of Petipa's dances as staged for his 1899 revival reconstructed from the choreographic notation of the Sergeyev Collection by Yuri Burlaka (also responsible for the music dramaturgy conception). Set: Boris Kaminsky, Costumes: Elena Zaitseva.\n\nThe English National Ballet became the first British ballet company to perform \"Le Corsaire\" as a complete work, in a production staged by Anna-Marie Holmes, completely re-imagined with original designs and costumes, plus a reworked score and new orchestrations. The production toured the UK visiting theatres in Milton Keynes, Southampton, Oxford, Bristol and Manchester, including a London season at the London Coliseum and was filmed for digital distribution by Digital Theatre. ENB had performed in Royal Opera House Muscat, Oman on 10,11,12 March 2016. The outreach team had given an excellent pre performance talk which made good understanding for the multi cultural spectators\n\n\n\n"}

Today, he is best remembered for employing Johann Sebastian Bach as his Kapellmeister between 1717 and 1723.\n\nHe was born at Köthen, the second (but eldest surviving) son of Emmanuel Lebrecht, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen, by his wife Gisela Agnes of Rath.\n\nAt his birth, the agnates of the Anhalt principalities still did not recognize Leopold's right of inheritance due to the morganatic status of his parents' marriage. These rights were confirmed on 28 June 1698, however, and Leopold was able to succeed his father when he died in 1704, at age ten. His mother, the Dowager Princess Gisela Agnes, acted as regent on his behalf, but King Frederick I of Prussia, according to the late Prince's will, became his \"upper guardian\". From the beginning of the regency, conflicts arose between the king and the dowager princess: Frederick preferred a Reformed (Calvinistic) education for Leopold, but Gisela Agnes, a devout Lutheran, planned to raise her son in her own faith. In the meanwhile, the king had founded the Knight's Academy (German: \"Ritterakademie\") in Brandenburg an der Havel, and in 1708 decided to send Leopold there for his education. In November of that year, during the festivities accompanying the King's new marriage, the Berlin court witnessed a performance of the opera \"Alexander and Roxana\" by Augustin Reinhard Stricker, in which the fourteen-year-old Leopold performed as a dancer.\n\nOn 9 October 1710 Leopold began his Grand Tour. He was escorted by the Lutheran Jobst Christoph von Zanthier, because \"no suitable Reformed chaperone could be found\". The Tour first took him to The Hague during the winter of 1710-1711, where his lifelong love of opera began: in only four months, he went to the opera twelve times. The operas of Jean-Baptiste Lully impressed him greatly, and he acquired a \"Rare fascination for the Opera of Monsieur Lully\". Also, he learned to play the harpsichord and violin. His travel diary is still preserved in the Köthen Historical Museum.\n\nAfter Leopold's return in 1711, King Frederick I wanted to make him a commander in the Prussian army, but the opposition of the dowager princess led him to withdraw this idea. Instead, Leopold traveled again, this time to England, where he attended the opera in London and visited the University of Oxford, whose famous library specially interested him.\n\nNext on his itinerary were Rome and Venice, where he spent 130 Thalers just for visits to the opera theaters. Later, he traveled to Florence, Turin, and finally Vienna, where he acquired a collection of twelve cantatas by Francesco Mancini. On 17 April 1713, Leopold returned to Köthen. In all, he spent the sum of 55,749 Thalers on his trips. In 1714 he seized an opportunity to create a court \"Kapelle\" (musical establishment) made possible by the dissolution of the royal Prussian court orchestra. Many of the Berlin musicians entered his service. Its first Kapellmeister was the opera composer Augustin Reinhard Stricker, who was succeeded by Bach three years later.\n\nOn 30 November 1715 Leopold was declared of age and began his personal rule over Anhalt-Köthen; on 14 May 1716 he formally took possession of the \"Schloss\" (main residence). His mother, the dowager princess, moved to her estate in Nienburg.\n\nProblems with succession quickly developed for the prince. As of 1702, the rule of primogeniture was instituted in Anhalt-Köthen; for this reason, Leopold forced his younger brother Augustus Louis to resign his joint rulership. As compensation, Leopold gave him the estate of Güsten, with its old \"Schloss\" built in 1547 by Prince George III, and the town of Warmsdorf with all its revenues, in addition to other concessions.\n\nLeopold nonetheless had repeated disputes with his brother Augustus Louis in Warmsdorf, as well as his mother in Nienburg. In 1718 (or 1719) Augustus Louis sent armed men to two of Leopold's towns in order to take them over. His own mother was informed of this situation and supported her younger son. In revenge for that humiliation, Leopold in 1721 sent troops into Nienburg, but mother and son were soon reconciled. In August 1722 Leopold and his brother were also finally reconciled and concluded a definitive divisionary treaty; their mother was not a part of the settlement.\n\nLeopold most likely made Bach's acquaintance at the wedding of his sister Eleonore Wilhelmine to Ernest Augustus I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, which was held at his mother's estate in Nienburg on 24 January 1716. When Stricker left his post the following year, Leopold lost no time in offering the job of Kapellmeister to Bach, who signed his contract on 7 August 1717. Unfortunately, Bach was not able to break easily from his former employer Duke William Ernest of Saxe-Weimar, who imprisoned him from 6 November-2 December 1717 for not following correct procedures in requesting release from his post as \"Konzertmeister\" at the court of Weimar. Only after 2 December 1717 Bach could finally take his new post in Köthen.\n\nThe simple style of church music mandated at Leopold's Reformed (Calvinistic) court led to Bach's concentration on instrumental music and secular vocal music during his employment at Köthen. \nMuch of Bach's secular music, including several of the \"Brandenburg Concerti\" and Part I of the \"Well-Tempered Clavier\", stem from his years at Köthen. Bach composed a number of secular cantatas, or serenatas, in Leopold's honor; for example \"Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV 134a\".\nHe also probably composed some music for Leopold to perform. Leopold played stringed instruments, in particular the viola de gamba. While some of Bach's music for that instrument written for the virtuoso Christian Ferdinand Abel to perform, it appears that easier music would have been performed by Leopold.\n\nLeopold and Bach appear to have had a good relationship. The prince stood as godfather for Bach's son, Leopold Augustus, who died in infancy in 1719.\nUnfortunately, Leopold had to contribute more and more to the Prussian military, leaving him with less money for music. In 1723 Bach left his post in Köthen to become \"Kantor\" at the Thomasschule in Leipzig. The main reason for Bach's departure was the reduction of the Köthen court orchestra, not any dissatisfaction with Bach's services on the part of the prince, but there were other sources of tension, such as a lack of interest in Bach's music on the part of the prince's first wife. \nNevertheless, in Leipzig Bach retained the role of Köthen court composer for the rest of Leopold's short life. In 1729 Bach returned to Köthen to direct the funeral music when the prince's embalmed body was transferred to St James church for burial. The text of this cantata \"Klagt, Kinder, klagt es aller Welt\", has survived, but Bach's music is lost: it might be an early version in at least ten parts of what was to become the \"St Matthew Passion\" for two choirs and orchestra.\n\nSchloss Köthen is now a museum, and a biannual Bach Festival is held in the very locations where much of his music was first performed.\n\nIn Bernburg on 11 December 1721 Leopold married his cousin Frederica Henriette (b. Bernburg, 24 January 1702 - d. Köthen, 4 April 1723), daughter of Karl Frederick, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg. They had one daughter:\n\nLeopold apparently named his daughter after his mother as a gesture of reconciliation between them.\n\nIn Weimar on 27 June 1725 Leopold married for a second time to Charlotte Frederike (b. Siegen, 30 November 1702 - d. Stadthagen, 22 July 1785), daughter of Frederick William Adolf, Prince of Nassau-Siegen. They had two children:\n\nThe only son and heir of Leopold succumbed to smallpox in August 1728, and the prince's second daughter, who also contracted the disease, died in early September. Soon Leopold caught smallpox as well; on 17 November he played his violin for the last time and died two days later in Köthen, aged thirty-three.\n\nWith no surviving male heir, Leopold was succeeded by his brother Augustus Louis.\n"}

The lake was constructed between 1962 and 1965 for the purpose of providing municipal water to the nearby communities of Del City, Midwest City and Norman. It is formed by an earthfill embankment (dam) long and up to high on the Little River. In addition to being a source for drinking water, Lake Thunderbird's secondary uses include numerous recreational activities.\n\nThe lake is named for the Native American legend of the Thunderbird, a supernatural bird of power and strength. Many locals commonly refer to the lake as \"Lake Dirtybird\" due to the very murky lake water.\n\nThe Little River valley was the subject of several Army United States Army Corps of Engineers studies in 1936 and 1947 for flood control. In 1953 the issue of water supply was raised among a council of local governments consisting of Norman, Midwest City, Del City, Moore and Tinker Air Force Base, and it was forecast that by the 1970s and 1980s the cities would be requiring all available water to meet municipal demand. A feasibility study in 1954 led to a plan report in May 1961, and construction began on Norman Dam in 1962.\n\nOklahoma State Highway 9 was re-routed in 1963 from present-day Alameda Street to its current location, south of the lake. The dam and lake were completed in 1965 by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. The earthen dam has a height of 144 feet and impounds 171,400 acre-feet of water. The Bureau owns the dam, which is operated by the local Central Oklahoma Master Conservancy District.\n\nLake Thunderbird is a venue for boating, fishing, and hiking. The lake has two marinas and a boathouse that are operated and maintained by the Lake Thunderbird Boathouse volunteer organization. The Boathouse Organization in cooperation with the Lake Thunderbird Education Foundation make possible several events throughout the year, including sailing lessons, sailing camps for children, an annual fishing derby for developmentally disabled children, sanctioned sailboat races, and fun regattas. Fish species stocked at the lake include large-mouth bass, crappie, sunfish, channel catfish, white bass, and saugeye.\n\nThe 6,000 acre (24 km²) lake is the centerpiece of Lake Thunderbird State Park. In addition to water activities the park offers hunting, horse rental and boarding, equestrian trails, hiking, mountain biking, nature trails, a nature center, and an archery range. The park has 447 primitive campsites and unfurnished one-room lake huts as well as RV provisions. The park is near two casinos and has its own restaurant, the Clear Bay Cafe, which is open seasonally and is accessible by boat or car. During the late spring rains in 2015 during the months of May and June, Lake Thunderbird flooded and the restaurant was so badly damaged that it closed indefinitely. On May 10, 2010 the Little River Marina was struck by a tornado and was closed until it was rebuilt in 2012.\n\nLake Thunderbird falls within the bald eagle winter migration corridor. Bald eagles are present at the lake roughly from December through February. Guided eagle tours are provided by the Crow's Secret Nature Center.\n\nIn recent years the lake has become the subject of national attention due to allegations of a lake monster, presumed to be a freshwater octopus. Due to an increase in reports of drownings in recent years, tales of the \"Oklahoma Octopus\" have increased, gaining national attention from well-known media outlets such as Animal Planet's \"Lost Tapes\". To date the octopus remains a myth since no freshwater species of octopus are known to exist, and because of the relatively young age of the human-made lake with no connecting inlets.\n\nThe water temperature of the lake ranges from about during the summer months to under during the winter months. In the summer, at a depth of , the water temperature is about cooler than at the surface. Surface water temperature is usually about during spring and fall months.\n\nAs of 2001, the lakes' standard surface level was at above sea level, the maximum depth of the lake was , with an average depth of .

Another version of a software stack is operating system, middleware, database, and applications. Regularly, the components of a software stack are developed by different developers independently from one another.\n\nSome components/subsystems of an overall system are chosen together often enough that the particular set is referred to by a name representing the whole, rather than by naming the parts. Typically, the name is an acronym representing the individual components.\n\nThe term \"solution stack\" has, historically, occasionally included hardware components as part of a final product, mixing both the hardware and software in layers of support.\n\nA \"full-stack developer\" is expected to be able to work in all the layers of the stack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Due to large-scale plantations of people from Scotland and England during the 17th and 18th centuries, as well as decades of conflict in the 20th, Ulster has a unique culture, quite different from the rest of Ireland. As all of Northern Ireland lies within Ulster and comprises about 90% of its population, the culture of Northern Ireland is very similar to that of the whole of Ulster.\n\nUlster English is the English-based dialect of most people in Ulster, including those in the two main cities. It represents a cross-over area between Ulster Scots and Hiberno-English. The dialect is currently encroaching on the Ulster Scots area, especially in the Belfast commuter belt, and may eventually consume it. Ulster Scots, also known as \"Ullans\", \"Hiberno-Scots\", or \"Scots-Irish\", refers to the variety of Scots spoken in parts of Ulster.\n\nUlster Irish is the dialect of the Irish language spoken in Ulster. The only county in Ulster to include Gaeltacht regions today is County Donegal, so that the term \"Donegal Irish\" is often used synonymously. Because of historical connections with Ulster, the southern dialects of Scottish Gaelic and Manx share similarities with Ulster Irish.\n\nPolish and Lithuanian are the most common foreign languages in Ulster.\n\nUlster Rugby represents the province in the European Rugby Champions.\n\nA dish from Ulster is the Ulster fry, usually served at breakfast. Also across Ulster dishes are found containing seafood, especially salmon and trout from County Donegal and County Down.\n\nA popular soft drink in Derry, parts of County Londonderry and parts of County Tyrone, as well as across County Donegal, is McDaid's Football Special, which is made in Ramelton.\n\nA famous ice cream made in Ulster is Morelli's, which is made near Portrush. Mullin's Icecream, made near Kilrea in the east of County Londonderry, is another famous Ulster icecream. In the south east of the province, Newry boasts 'Timoney's' ice cream on Canal Street, Warrenpoint has the famed 'Genoa' and Rathfriland on the hill is fortunate to host Graham's.\n\nNewry, Banbridge and Warrenpoint feature the famed Friar Tucks, which is particularly noted for its chicken burger experience. If you love coleslaw you order 'A number one with plenty.'\n\nA well-known sweet made in Ulster is Yellow Man, while a famous confectionery company is Oatfield Sweets Ltd., who are based in Letterkenny in County Donegal. Oatfield, who have been in business since 1927, are particularly famous for producing the \"Emerald\" sweet.\n\nUlster Irish or \"Donegal Irish\" is exclusive to Ulster. Ulster Irish is very different, as is the old style of prose and songwriting. Whereas in other parts of Ireland songs tend to be structured, in Ulster songs are wider ranging in style. Counties Donegal and Antrim are well known for songs of speed, much like Donegal fiddle playing. It is unique in the sean-nós traditional in both tempo and in wording and is often more \"free\" in structure and ornamentation.\n\nNotable Ulster singers and songwriters by historical area*:\n\nUlster fiddle playing is distinct from the rest of Ireland in that it has been greatly influenced from neighbouring Scotland, in particular the Hebrides.\n\n\n"}
