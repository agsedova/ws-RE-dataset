The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Locomotive Department was headquartered at Crewe from 1862. The Crewe Works had been built in 1840–43 by the Grand Junction Railway.\n\nThe LNWR was formed in 1846 with the merger of the Grand Junction Railway, the London and Birmingham Railway and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway.\n\nThe GJR and the Liverpool & Manchester Railway initially had their workshops at Edge Hill. The London & Birmingham workshops were at Wolverton. The Grand Junction built a new works at Crewe which opened in 1843, while the Manchester and Birmingham's works was at Longsight.\n\nWhile the GJR and M&BR locos were mainly by Robert Stephenson and Sharp Brothers, the L&B's were mostly \"Bury\" types – indeed Edward Bury was its locomotive superintendent. On the GJR, breakages of the inside-cylinder engines' crank axles led to the redesign of several with outside cylinders under locomotive superintendent Francis Trevithick. These later became known as the \"Old Crewe\" types.\n\nAfter the creation of the LNWR in 1846, Crewe and Wolverton became headquarters of the Northern and Southern Divisions respectively, with Longsight as the headquarters of the North Eastern Division.\n\nIn 1922 the LNWR merged with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the North London Railway to form a larger company still called the LNWR.\n\nSee:\n\nThe first Northern Division Locomotive Superintendent (at Crewe works) was Francis Trevithick, son of Richard Trevithick, who continued to build the basic 2-2-2 and 2-4-0 designs. Alexander Allan was Works Manager at Crewe from 1843 to 1853.\n\n\nIn 1857 the North Eastern Division locomotive department, with headquarters at Longsight, was absorbed into that of the Northern Division. Trevithick was dismissed and returned to Cornwall with an honorarium, and was replaced at Crewe by John Ramsbottom as Northern Division Superintendent. Ramsbottom began to standardise and modernise the locomotive stock, initially replacing the 2-4-0 goods engines with his \"DX\" 0-6-0, of which over 900 were built at Crewe from 1858 to 1872. \n\nThe first Southern Division Locomotive Superintendent was Edward Bury who had been in charge of the London and Birmingham Railway locomotive department at Wolverton since before that railway opened. He resigned in 1847 and later became General Manager of the Great Northern Railway. His successor at Wolverton was James McConnell who had previously worked for the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway at their Bromsgrove works. Among the classes built under his superintendence were the very successful 2-2-2 \"Bloomers\", developed from a Bury design, and the Wolverton Express Goods 0-6-0 class, built from 1854 to 1863. The Southern Division's trains were longer and heavier, and 0-6-0 locos had been introduced as early as 1845.\nThere were distinct differences between the Southern and Northern Division locomotive policies. Wolverton had been set up in 1838 for repair work only, the locomotives being purchased from outside firms, whereas Crewe, from its foundation in 1843, was a locomotive-building works. Only a dozen locomotives were built at Wolverton from 1845 to the end of 1854, but in the following year construction started in earnest, and another 154 were completed in 1855–1863. The Southern Division engines were bigger, heavier and more expensive than those of the Northern Division, and after a disagreement with the cost-conscious Chairman, Richard Moon, in 1862 McConnell was obliged to resign. The Southern and Northern locomotive departments were amalgamated, and John Ramsbottom became Locomotive Superintendent of the entire LNWR, his headquarters remaining at Crewe. Locomotive building and repairing were gradually run down at Wolverton, which became the LNWR's carriage works in 1865.\n\nAll LNWR locomotives were painted black from 1873; for many years the goods engines were plain black, but passenger engines were given red, white and blue-grey lining, and most goods engines were similarly lined from the 1890s. Before 1873 locomotives had been green with black lines, and this seems to have been the normal livery from London & Birmingham and Grand Junction times. \n\nIn the 1850s on the Southern Division, McConnell had some of his express engines painted green with more elaborate patterns of lining in various colours, and in 1861–62 a few Southern Division engines were painted a very dark plum-red. The widespread belief that McConnell's engines were painted vermilion is incorrect, despite its constant repetition.\n\nWith a reasonably comprehensive fleet, Bowen Cooke arranged exchanges with other railways in 1909 and 1910 to assess the scope for improvements, among which was superheating.\n\nIn 1922 the LNWR merged with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR) to form a larger company still called the LNWR. George Hughes, formerly CME of the L&YR became CME of the LNWR. A year later the large company was grouped into the LMS and Hughes became CME of the LMS.\n\nIn the early days, locomotives were bought from outside builders but, from 1863, they were built in the North London Railway's workshops at Bow, London.\n\n\n\nCrewe's influence on the locomotives of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway was less than that of its great rival the Midland Railway. However, the LMS did produce an unsuccessful \"Midlandised\" version of the G class 0-8-0s, see LMS Class 7F 0-8-0.\n\nPreserved L&NWR locomotives are:\nA full-size working replica of an LNWR Bloomer Class locomotive was begun at Tyseley in 1986, was 90% completed by 1990, but has never been finished (2020).\n\nAnother full-size replica of the same type (but non-working) was built in Milton Keynes, and was exhibited outside the station there from 1991; it is now (2018) in Milton Keynes Museum.\n\nA miniature one-sixth scale locomotive 'Orion' was built by G R S Darroch during his time at Crewe Works. It is based on the LNWR Alfred the Great Class and is the only surviving Crewe built Webb Compound. (Completed circa 1910-12) The locomotive is in the ownership of the Stephenson Locomotive Society and currently based at Shildon Locomotion Museum.\n\nPreserved L&YR locomotives can be found on its own page.\n\n"}

It is served by a local bus service and is from Dorking West railway station on the North Downs Line.\n\nThe village is drained solely by the midsection of the Pipp Brook from Wotton Common and sources in the parish (rising at its furthest source south at Leith Hill), which then flows by the village centre in its northern farmland flowing into Dorking and discharging at the lowest part of Dorking's former other chapelry in Pixham. As such the village was rooted on its road, the A25 and mill and rests in a valley at the foot of the steep slopes of Ranmore and the North Downs to the north and Greensand Ridge to the south. Some of the village is in the Surrey Hills AONB and its single through-road in two directions is on the annual London-Surrey cycle classic route.\n\nIn Squire's Wood, south of Westcott, is Mag's Well, one of the sources of Pipp Brook. It was formerly of some repute as a medicinal spring, and is strongly impregnated with iron. A building, ruined, existed over it, and in the Victorian period children still bathed in it.\n\nThere is a thatched dovecot on the village green. The weather vane on top of the dovecot has had the N replaced by a T such that it now shows the letters WEST.\n\nWestcott or Westcote lay in the Wotton Hundred. It along with superseded Milton was the upper borough, turned into a chapelry of Dorking also in the Victorian period. The lower hamlet being Pixham As such, it contributed significantly to the wealth and trade of Dorking, including in the wool and meat from sheep farming on the North Downs within the parish bounds.\n\nBury Hill here was recorded in the 15th century. It became a manor, formed from waste (infertile land) of the manor of Milton, Dorking. James Walter was buying the land in 1753 and he built the house then and planted the grounds. He died 1780, when the 3rd Viscount Grimston, his daughter's husband, succeeded him here. In 1812 his son and heir, about to be created Earl of Verulam, sold it to a wealthy Scottish individual, Robert Barclay and it descended to his Barclay heir in the Edwardian period when The Nower was \"a [neighbouring] favourite [hill] walk for Dorking people\" and he was the ancestor of comedy executive/producer Humphrey Barclay.\nMany pre-1800 listed building homes including some that are thatched are in the lanes leading off the A25, including Leslie Howard's (actor 1893–1943) \"Stowe Maries\" (built in the 1550s) in Balchins Lane. Milton Street and Westcott Street lead to several more old buildings. The Church of the Holy Trinity is Grade II* as it was commissioned to be designed 1851, by Sir George Gilbert Scott made of knapped flint with ashlar quoins/dressings. Its spire has a clock, weather vane and bells within its 14th-century style. It is of stone, with a small western turret. Charles Barclay of Bury Hill gave for it to be built, and Lady Mary Leslie the same as endowment. The clock was put up to commemorate the Jubilee of 1887. The parsonage house was built at the sole expense of Barclay and the secular Westcote Schools were built by subscription in 1854; and an infant school by subscription in 1882.\n\nIt was the second nearest village, with some trade, to John Evelyn's Wotton House and Estate, well known by the diarist, garden landscaper and society favourite in the mid to late 17th century; in 1694 Evelyn moved into his completed house.\n\nThe average distance travelled to work is .\n\nOf the original three public houses \"The Prince of Wales\" remains. \"The Crown\" finally closed in September 2011. \"Bay Leaf\", a popular Indian restaurant is a feature of the village, an ingenious reinvention of the rather old public house, \"The Cricketers\".\n\nIt has an art gallery, a number of small stores, a bicycle shop and one general store. A second general store with integrated Post Office closed in December 2016. The village is busy with cyclists every weekend as the area offers some of the best mountain biking in Southern England.\n\nWestcott's village school celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2004. In 2010 it was merged with the nearby Abinger Common to create a two-campus school known as the \"Surrey Hills Church of England Primary School\".\n\nIn 2009 a skate ramp and football goals were installed in the village park.\n\nThe proportion of households who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).\n\n"}

Daniels. It stars Burt Lancaster, Hume Cronyn and Charles Bickford.\n\nThis was among several noir films made by Dassin during the postwar period. The others were \"Thieves' Highway\", \"Night and the City\" and \"The Naked City\".\n\nOn a dark, rainy morning at Westgate Prison, prisoners crammed into a small cell watch through the window as Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) returns from his term in solitary confinement. Joe is angry and talks about escape. The beleaguered warden is under pressure to improve discipline. His chief of security, Capt. Munsey (Hume Cronyn), is a sadist who manipulates prisoners to inform on one another and create trouble so he can inflict punishment. The often drunk prison doctor (Art Smith) warns that the prison is a powder keg and will explode if they are not careful. He denounces Munsey's approach and complains that the public and government officials fail to understand the need for rehabilitation.\n\nJoe's attorney visits and tells Joe his wife Ruth (Ann Blyth) is not willing to have an operation for cancer unless Joe can be there with her. He takes his revenge on fellow inmate Wilson (James O'Rear), who at Munsey's instigation had planted a weapon on Joe that earned him a stay in solitary. Joe has organized the brutal attack on Wilson in the prison machine shop but provides himself with an alibi by talking with the doctor in his office while the murder occurs.\n\nJoe presses another inmate, Gallagher (Charles Bickford), to help him escape but Gallagher has a good job at the prison newspaper and Munsey has promised him parole soon. Munsey then instigates a prisoner's suicide, giving higher authorities the opportunity to revoke all prisoner privileges and cancel parole hearings. Gallagher feels betrayed and decides to join Joe's escape plan. Joe and Gallagher plan an assault on the guard tower where they can get access to the lever that lowers a bridge that controls access to the prison.\n\nWhile the escape plan is taking shape, each of the inmates in cell R17 tells their story, and in every case, their love for a woman is what landed them in trouble with the law. Munsey learns the details of the escape plan from an informer, one of the men in cell R17, and the break goes badly. The normally subdued prison yard turns into a violent and bloody riot, killing Munsey, Gallagher, and the remainder of the inmates in cell R17, including Joe.\n\nThe direct inspiration for the unremitting desperate violence was the recent \"Battle of Alcatraz\" (May 2–4, 1946) in which prisoners fought a hopeless two-day battle rather than surrender in the aftermath of a failed escape attempt. The film has a number of brutal scenes including the crushing of a stool pigeon prisoner under a stamping machine and the beating of a prisoner bound to a chair by straps. Film writer Eddie Muller wrote that \"the climax of \"Brute Force\" displayed the most harrowing violence ever seen in movie theaters.\"\n\nThe staff at \"Variety\" magazine gave the film a positive review, writing, \"A closeup on prison life and prison methods, \"Brute Force\" is a showmanly mixture of gangster melodramatics, sociological exposition, and sex...The s.a. elements are plausible and realistic, well within the bounds, but always pointing up the \"femme fatale.\" Thus Yvonne De Carlo, Ann Blyth, Ella Raines and Anita Colby are the women on the 'outside' whose machinations, wiles or charms accounted for their men being on the 'inside'...Bristling, biting dialog by Richard Brooks paints broad cameos as each character takes shape under existing prison life. Bickford is the wise and patient prison paper editor whose trusty (Levene), has greater freedom in getting 'stories' for the sheet. Cronyn is diligently hateful as the arrogant, brutal captain, with his system of stoolpigeons and bludgeoning methods.\"\n\nFilm critic Bosley Crowther wrote, \"Not having intimate knowledge of prisons or prisoners, we wouldn't know whether the average American convict is so cruelly victimized as are the principal prison inmates in \"Brute Force,\" which came to Loew's Criterion yesterday. But to judge by this 'big house' melodrama, the poor chaps who languish in our jails are miserably and viciously mistreated and their jailers are either weaklings or brutes...\"Brute Force\" is faithful to its title—even to taking law and order into its own hands. The moral is: don't go to prison; you meet such vile authorities there. And, as the doctor observes sadly, 'Nobody ever escapes.'\"\n\nMore recently, critic Dennis Schwartz wrote, \"Jules Dassin (\"Rififi\" and \"Naked City\") directs this hard-hitting but outdated crime drama concerned about prison conditions... The point hammered home is that the prison system reflects the values of society, as Dassin castigates society for creating and then turning a blind eye toward the brutality and insensitivity of a prison system that offers no chance for rehabilitation.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2055816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055816", "title": "Woodland vole", "text": "Woodland vole\n\nThe woodland vole (\"Microtus pinetorum\") is a small vole found in eastern North America. It is also known as the pine vole.\n\nThe woodland vole has a head and body length ranging between with a short tail. Its weight ranges between . It has a brown (light or dark) dorsal region with a whitish or silvery underside. The eyes,external ears and tail are reduced to adapt to their partially subterranean lifestyle.\n\nThe woodland vole lives throughout the eastern United States, ranging as far as Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. They inhabit deciduous forests, dry fields, and apple orchards. Voles prefer wooded areas with high vertical vegetative stratification but also evergreen shrubs, ground cover, and old fallen logs. Deciduous forests with moist, friable soils are suitable for burrowing and voles are most abundant in these habitats. However, they can also be found in other habitats from dry fields to the edges of coastal bays. In addition, apple orchards are a favorite habitat. The root systems of trees are an important food source for vole and thus tree spacing affects the density of vole populations.\n\nVoles prefer to live in soils ranging from loam/peat moss mixtures, to gravel or stone soils, but not very dry soils. Alfisol and Ultisol soil types are particularly favored due to being favorable to the vole's burrowing system. Voles feed on both the roots and stem system and the vegetation of plants, as well as fruits, seeds, bark, subterranean fungus and insects. Because they feed on roots and tubers, voles do not need to drink water much. Voles cache food, primarily during the winter. Voles spend most of their time underground in their burrow systems and seldom venture into the surface. This makes them safe from hawks and owls. Other predators of voles include snakes, weasels and mountain lions. They are also susceptible to ectoparasites like lice, fleas, mites, and chiggers.\n\nWoodland voles live in family groups in burrow systems in home ranges around 14.75-17.75 in (40–45 cm). The burrows are exclusive to the family groups, however a group usually does not need to defend its burrows as other voles usually will not invade them. The size and location of the home range and dispersal of groups are limited by neighboring family groups. Family groups of the vole are made of a breeding female, a breeding male, their 1–4 offspring and sometimes a few other members that serve as helpers. Helpers are immigrants from other groups. Group emigration is uncommon and dependant on whether there are available positions in other groups. Staying in a group as a non-breeding individual is beneficial as burrow systems are major investments and a limited resource.\n\nIn the north, the breeding season lasts from March to sometime between November and January. In the south, the breeding season continues throughout the year. In order to enter estrus, a female must sense chemosignals in a male and have physical contact. Because females are dispersed with little overlap of different colonies, polygamy is rare among voles. In addition, the breeding female in a family group will stress the reproduction of female helpers. Females are fiercely loyal to their partners and are highly aggressive towards unfamiliar males. A young female vole usually first conceives around 105 days but can conceive as early as 77 days. A female will develop a vaginal plug after copulation which lasts for three days. Gestation lasts 20–24 days with 1–4 litters produced per year, each with 1–5 young. When a vole's partner dies, it is replaced by an unrelated individual. This results in a conflict between the surviving parent and its offspring of the same sexes for mating opportunities. A new male in a group gives a non-breeding female a chance to breed although the resident breeding female is still an obstacle.\n\nWoodland voles create high economic loss through the damage they cause to apple orchards. Vole feeding costs apple growers annual losses of nearly $50 million. As such farmers see them as pests. Urban environments have little impact on vole habitat selection.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2055821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055821", "title": "Gran Canaria Airport", "text": "Gran Canaria Airport\n\nGran Canaria Airport , sometimes also known as Gando Airport (), is a passenger and freight airport on the island of Gran Canaria. It is an important airport within the Spanish air-transport network (owned and managed by a public enterprise, AENA), as it holds the sixth position in terms of passengers, and fifth in terms of operations and cargo transported. It is also ranks first of the Canary Islands in all three categories, although the island of Tenerife has higher passenger numbers overall between the two airports located on the island.\n\nThe airport is located in the eastern part of Gran Canaria on the Bay of Gando (Bahía de Gando), to the south of Las Palmas, and from the popular tourist areas in the south. In 2014 it handled over 10.3 million passengers, ranking 1st in the Canary Islands and 5th in Spain by passenger traffic. Gran Canaria Airport is an important hub for passengers travelling to West Africa (Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, Cape Verde, among others), and to the Atlantic Isles of Madeira and the Azores. It serves as base for Binter Canarias, Canaryfly, Ryanair, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Vueling. Other airlines use it as a base to operate charter flights to Cape Verde and Gambia (TUI fly Deutschland and TUI fly Nordic), but only in the winter.\n\nIn 1919, Frenchman Pierre George Latécoère was granted clearance from the French & Spanish governments to establish an airline route between Toulouse and Casablanca. This also included stopovers in Málaga, Alicante and Barcelona. The airport opened on 7 April 1930, after King Alfonso XIII signed a royal order announcing that the military air force installations on the Bay of Gando would become a civilian airfield. In its existence, the airport has become the largest gateway into the Canary Islands, as well as the largest in terms of passenger and cargo operations.\n\nIn 1946, the old passenger terminal opened, which took two years to build. In 1948 a runway was built, which was completed and fully tarmacked in 1957.\n\nIn 1963, improvements to the airport were made. This included new parking spaces, enlargement of the terminal and the provision of a visual approach slope indicator system. In 1964, a transmission station was built. In 1966 a new control tower was completed, replacing the old control tower that was constructed in 1946. In 1970, work began on the current passenger terminal which opened in March 1973. During this time, a second runway was being built and this was completed in 1980. \n\nOn 18 February 1988, Binter Canarias announced that the airline's main base was to be established at Gran Canaria. The base opened on 26 March 1989. In October 1991, the terminal was enlarged with improved facilities so it could handle more passengers.\n\nIn December 2010, low-cost carrier Ryanair announced the opening of 3 new bases on the Canary Islands. In addition to Gran Canaria these include Lanzarote and Tenerife South. Ryanair presently operates 30 routes from Gran Canaria. The airport was an official alternative (emergency) landing site for the NASA Space Shuttle, before the ending of the Space Shuttle programme in July 2011.\n\nAs of 2011, there was a programme to expand the airport, extending the terminal and creating a new runway. In 2015 this major renovation of Gran Canaria airport was completed. Among the improvements was increasing the number of baggage belts, 16 to 24, check-in counters from 96 to 132 and gates, up to 40. The new terminal area is now fully active, doubling the previous area. There is also a plan for the building of a new runway for the airport.\n\nThe airport has one terminal which opened in March 1973. It was later extended in October 1991 to increase passenger traffic. Despite being a building of historical interest, in 2013 the original passenger terminal building, opened in 1946, was demolished to make way for a further extension which opened in 2014. Although dramatically expanded over the years the airport remains a single terminal airport.\n\nThere are four check-in areas. Check-in Area 1 (desks 101 to 118) is in the newest part of the airport (which opened on 16 July 2014) and serves almost exclusively flights operated by CanaryFly, Air Europa and Binter Canarias (mainly inter-island flights between the Canary Islands or to Morocco). At times of very high demand, check-in Area 1 may provide overflow capacity for Areas 2, 3 and 4. Check-in Area 2 (desks 201 to 234) is located in the first part of the \"new\" airport which opened in 1973. This area was completely refurbished in 2014 and is normally used for flights handled by Iberia plus some of those handled by Ground Force (Globalia Handling). Check-in Area 3 (desks 301 to 352) is in the second part of the \"new\" airport which originally opened in 1991 and is used for flights handled by Ground Force. Additionally, airline Norwegian Air Shuttle have dedicated check-in desks and self-check-in podiums located to the southern end of Area 3. Check-in Area 4 (desks 401 to 406) is located downstairs between the police station and the main car rental offices (Hertz, Europcar, CICAR, TopCar , Gold Car and Avis Rent a Car System) and is used exclusively by Ryanair.\n\nThere are two security filters where passengers pass from the general public areas into the departures area. At these security filters passengers and their hand luggage is scanned to ensure no prohibited items pass. The main security filter is located between Check-in Areas 2 and 3. There is a second filter located in Check-in Area 1 which is intended to serve exclusively passengers of inter-island flights.\n\nThe terminal departures area is split into four zones (A, B, C, and D). Zone A is for flights to the other Canary Islands, Zones B and C are for European Union (including Spain), Switzerland, Iceland, and Scandinavian flights and Zone D is for other international flights. The gates in Zone A are at ground floor level to the Northern end of the terminal. Other gates are on the first floor (the same level as the security filters into departures) those in Zone D featuring additional security to allow for the screening of international passengers.\n\nThere are two arrivals areas numbered \"1\" and \"2\" both located downstairs at ground level. Area 1 serves all arrivals of flights originating within Spain and is located to the Northern end of the airport. Some of the car rental companies have additional counters in this area as it is a considerable walk to the main car rental area. Area 2 serves all international arrivals and is located to the Southern end of the airport. As the majority of arrivals served by area 2 are for tourist flights, many bringing passengers travelling on package holidays organized by tour operators, there is a large coach park (Parking A) located immediately in front of this area. Overflow coach parking (which is required only in the Winter months) is provided at the departures level (Parking B) and is accessed from arrivals area 2 via a purpose-built a pedestrian tunnel with stairs and travelators.\n\nThe airport can be reached by several island roads from all points in the island. There are special bus service from most towns in Gran Canaria, but access by taxi is usual.\n\nGran Canaria's main motorway GC1 runs past the airport providing transport links to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in the North and to the tourist resorts in the South.\n\nPlans have existed for several years to construct a rail link connecting the airport to Las Palmas and Maspalomas. The Tren de Gran Canaria scheme, estimated to cost €1,500 million, has not been confirmed due to funding problems.\n\nThere is an airbase of the Spanish Air Force to the east of the runways. Beyond several hangars opposite to the passenger terminal, the Gando Air Base (\"Base Aérea de Gando\") contains ten shelters situated on the southern end of the eastern runway. They harbor the \"Ala 46\" with F/A-18 Hornets, CASA 212 and the Eurocopter AS 532 of SAR . \"Ala 46\" or 46 Wing, composed of 462 and 802 fighter squadron, defends the Spanish airspace around the Canary Islands. It is one of the biggest and most important air bases of the Spanish Air Force and is unique for the wide variety of aircraft which it operates.\n\nMilitary activity was most intense during the mid 1970s, at the time of the crisis of decolonisation of Western Sahara and its occupation by Morocco. Military crises in Western Africa, like the 2013 Mali intervention by France, made Gando Air Base the main air platform for operations in Western Africa area by NATO. In 2006 Spain proposed Gando Air Base as headquarters for the newly created US Africa Command (AFRICOM), but the AFRICOM HQ was ultimately based in Stuttgart (Germany).\n\nThe \"Canary Islands Air Command\" (\"Mando Aéreo de Canarias\" – \"MACAN\") is based in the city of Las Palmas. Canary Islands Air Command is the only territorial general Air Command Air Force in Spain; its mission is the maintenance, preparation and command of air units located in the Canary archipelago. Any Spanish military airplane that lands in the Canary Islands is immediately put at the disposal of the Canary Islands Air Command, who can retain it and use it as long as necessary for missions within the islands. This happens sometimes with heavy military transport, antisubmarine warfare and early warning airplanes; the islands do not have these on a permanent basis. Once the plane is released by the Canary Islands Air Command, it can leave the Canary Islands and reverts to the Air Force Commands of mainland Spain.\n\nThe deployment base of Gando Air Base is the Lanzarote Military Airfield (Aeródromo Militar de Lanzarote). Lanzarote Military Airfield has permanently its own Air Force troops platoons and the radar for the air defence (the EVA 22, which covers the Eastern Canary Islands and the maritime area up to the Sahara), but it has no permanently based military planes, using the ones from Gando.\n\nCanaryfly has its head office in Hangar L. Binter Canarias also has its head office on the airport grounds.\n\nAt 1:15 PM on 27 March 1977, a bomb planted by the Movement for the Independence and Autonomy of the Canaries Archipelago (MPAIAC) exploded in a florist's shop on the terminal concourse. Fifteen minutes of warning was given to the airport authorities, who started to evacuate the building; the inside of the terminal was damaged and eight people were injured, one seriously. A later telephone call claimed responsibility for the explosion and hinted that a second bomb had been planted somewhere in the terminal building; the airport was closed and searched, necessitating the diversion of several incoming flights, including a number of large aircraft on long international flights, to Los Rodeos airport (later named Tenerife North Airport) on the nearby island of Tenerife. The resulting runway congestion on the small regional airport was a factor in the subsequent disaster at Los Rodeos, when just after 5:00 p.m. two Boeing 747s originally bound for Gran Canaria collided on the Los Rodeos runway, resulting in 583 deaths, the worst aviation accident in history.\n"}

Its origins lie strongly within the garage rock sound of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nPunk blues can be said to favor the common rawness, simplicity and emotion shared between the punk and blues genres. Chet Weise, singer/guitarist of the Immortal Lee County Killers stated, \"Punk and blues are both honest reactions to life. It's blues, it's our blues. It's just a bit turned up and a bit faster.\"\n\nBefore the beginning of the punk movement of the late 1970s, several important forerunners such as the MC5, the Stooges, the Who, the Sonics, Captain Beefheart, and the New York Dolls displayed a fascination with American blues.\n\nAllMusic states that punk blues draws on the influence of the \"garage rock sound of the mid-'60s, the primal howl of early Captain Beefheart, and especially in the raw and desperate sound of the Gun Club's landmark \"Fire of Love\" LP from 1981.\" Also according to Allmusic.com, \"...punk blues really came to life in the early '90s with bands like the seminal Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, the Oblivians, the Gories and the Gibson Brothers\", and \"continued into the 2000s with even more visibility thanks to the popularity of the White Stripes\". John Doe of L.A. punk band X claims that frontman Jeffrey Lee Pierce and the Gun Club invented a completely new style of music by mixing punk and blues.\n\nBeginning with their 1988 album \"Prison Bound\", the punk band Social Distortion began incorporating rockabilly, country, and blues influences into their music. In the same time period, Rollins Band performed punk-inflected blues jams. In the early 1990s, British musician PJ Harvey also explored an avant-garde variant of the style.\n\nThe Detroit garage rock scene that bore bands such as the White Stripes, inspired by Flat Duo Jets, continues to thrive with punk blues musicians and bands that can be tied to the style, such as the Detroit Cobras, Geraldine, Mystery Girls, Soledad Brothers, the Von Bondies, and many others. The MemphisAsheville band the Reigning Sound and the Boston band Mr. Airplane Man also plays in this style.\n\nThe indie rock bands the Kills, and Deadboy & the Elephantmen, have been associated by the media with a punk/blues sound.\n\n"}

Doctors of Madness frontman Richard Strange guested on synthesizer on the title track., \n\nContemporary critics were generally dismissive of the album and the band's change of direction, but it has since been reevaluated.\n\nWriting for AllMusic, critic Dave Thompson said, \"A flagrant departure from even the most extreme expectations, \"Cast of Thousands\" not only cast the band adrift from the new wave mainstream, but it would also alienate all but the most adaptable of the band's following\".\n\nA retrospective review in \"The Quietus\" noted that the album was still not \"an easy listen\", but praised the \"wild, free and comparatively sophisticated\" version of the band, and called the title track a \"thrilling, rolling, tumbling, swirling mess of adventure and hope\".\n\nHenry Rollins is a fan of the band, and of this album in particular. “The record shows the band’s ability to mesh pop hooks and still hold an edge. Besides The Clash, none of their peers at the time had the chops or the guts to do such work.

They resided in Idaho, Nevada, California, and Utah. The tribes are very closely related culturally to the Paiute, Goshute, Bannock, Ute, and Timbisha tribes.\n\nThey speak the Western dialect of the Shoshone language. Other Shoshone-speaking groups include the Goshute (Utah-Nevada border), Northern Shoshone (southern Idaho), and Eastern Shoshone (western Wyoming).\n\nBands of Western Shoshone are named for their traditional geographical homelands and their primary food sources.\n\nFederally recognized Western Shoshone tribes include:\n\nThe Western Shoshone have been engaged in legal battles with the federal government over rights to their land since the erroneous filing of a claim in 1951 for land presumed to have been taken. Most western states comprising the Great Basin were created by federal statutes that referenced that \"no part of Indian country will be included into the boundaries or jurisdiction of any state or territory ...without the consent of the Indians\". During the American Civil War 1861-1864, gold was needed from the west by the Union to prosecute the war against the south. The Doty treaties were entered into by the US with the Shoshone. In 1863 the Treaty of Ruby Valley was entered into with the Western Bands of the Shoshone Nation (18 Statute 689-692) and identified the boundaries of their territory. The Western Shoshone did not consent to the inclusion of their property into the boundaries or jurisdiction of any state or territory. The Western Shoshone possess all the interests the United States sought to purchase by the treaty for $5,000 per year for 20 years. The treaty was also used by the Union to demonstrate to European governments and banks backing the Union that it could do what it said and provide the gold needed for the war. \"the treaty is in full force and effect\" The United States failed to make any, but the first payment. In an effort to close a 1951 Indian Claims Commission 326-k case, the Western Shoshone Claims Distribution Act of 2004 established by the United States to give the perception that the Indians have been served justice, made payment of $160 million to the Great Basin tribe for the perceived acquisition of . The 326-k claim was $1.05 per acre for 26,000 million acres but did not in fact constitute a transfer of rights, title and interest since the Treaty of Ruby Valley is controlling. These facts are the basis for the failure of the United States Department of Energy to prove ownership to the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository and the withdrawal of the license application. In 1979 Congress appropriated $26 million to settle the land claims, but the tribes said they wanted the US to abide by the 1863 treaty and stop trespassing on their lands. In 1985 the US Supreme Court ruled in the US v. Dann that the appropriation of funds by Congress and the acceptance by the Secretary of the Interior constitutes \"payment\" and effects Section 70 U of the ICC Act and forever bars further claims and Western Shoshone title is 'presumed to be extinguished', but the tribes have left the money with the government. As recently as 2004, Congress has attempted to force the purchase of Western Shoshone land but this has been opposed by the majority of tribal leaders. Disputes over tribal land and the international recognition by the United Nations of their struggle against the United States government is documented in the 2008 film \"American Outrage\".\n\nWestern Shoshone have demonstrated related to a number of issues as they try to protect their property; they have called for an end to nuclear testing within their country as well as filing injunctions against gold mining that would result in dewatering of Mount Tenabo, Nevada.\n\nThe Western Shoshone have issued their own passports since 1992. In 2010, when Timbisha Shoshone Chairman Joe Kennedy and Western Shoshone elder Carrie Dann went to the World Peoples Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth in Cochabamba, Bolivia, Chairman Kennedy traveled on his Western Shoshone passport.

Sedevacantism holds that Pope Paul VI—sometimes going back to include John XXIII—and his successors are not valid Popes.\n\nSchuckardt was born in Seattle, Washington on July 10, 1937 to Frank and Gertrude Schuckardt. Francis graduated from O'Dea High School in 1954 and from Seattle University in 1959 with a bachelor's degree in education and linguistics. After college, he enrolled in the seminary but dropped out before the year ended due to ill health. He began teaching high school in Seattle and worked as a linguistic research analyst.\n\nIn 1958 Schuckardt joined the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima, a group devoted to spreading the message of Our Lady of Fátima. In 1961, Schuckardt was stricken with typhoid; this was the beginning of a long succession of illnesses. He was in and out of a coma for eight days. He experienced a remarkable recovery which he attributed to the intercession of the Virgin Mary. In January 1963, he was hospitalized with thrombophlebitis of the legs. The illness reversed itself to which Schuckardt again attributed to a miracle resulting from a promise he made to Our Lady of Fatima, promising her that he would use his legs to travel and spread her message. He gained considerable fame as a charismatic speaker for the Blue Army and was elected to its International Council in 1963 at the age of 26. Schuckardt was the only member of the Council who was not a national chairman. He was subsequently appointed to the position of International Secretary, but subsequently dismissed in 1967 for criticizing the Second Vatican Council.\n\nHe said that after a long and hard struggle, accompanied by much prayer and research, he concluded that from the Second Vatican Council emerged a \"new\" religion which was not truly “Catholic” (Open Letter to members of the Fatima Crusade, ca. 1968), and that Paul VI was a false Pope, that is, an illegitimate due to personal heresies. He also criticized the liturgical reforms of Vatican II and the teachings on ecumenism as severe departures of \"true\" Catholic doctrine.\n\nAbout the time of his departure from the Blue Army, Schuckardt began giving lectures throughout the United States, promoting devotion to the Virgin Mary as well as speaking out against the various doctrinal changes that were, he claimed, the result of the Second Vatican Council.\n\nIn 1968, Schuckardt founded a traditionalist community based in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho called the Fatima Crusade. Schuckardt and an associate, Denis Chicoine, began a national lecture circuit advocating a return to traditional Catholicism. Due to their outspoken rejection of the Second Vatican Council and embrace of sedevacantism, Schuckardt and his followers were denounced by the Roman Catholic Church. However several traditional-minded Catholic priests (some Jesuits and diocesan priests) had joined Schuckhardt and would provide the Fatima Crusade with the traditional, Roman Rite of the sacraments and the Mass. In his public discourses (which were preserved on audiotape), then-Brother Schuckardt reminded his followers that, despite the apostasy of Vatican II, Christ would most certainly provide for legitimate apostolic succession in \"the Catholic Church\".\n\nWith his rejection of the reforms and authority of what he considered to be the \"new Catholic Church\", or the Novus Ordo (New Order), he formed an organization known as the Tridentine Latin Rite Catholic Church (TLRCC). He insisted that this is not a \"new church\", but the same Catholic Church that existed for almost two millennia prior to the changes imposed by Vatican II. His followers refer to the church generally recognized as the Roman Catholic Church as the \"Modern Catholic Church\" or the \"Post-Vatican Council II Church\". They labelled Paul VI the \"arch-heretic of Rome\" and referred to the mainstream church as \"the Church of the Beast\". \"Who would be so bold or so foolish as to call these bishops Catholic or to pretend that they possess any legitimate authority? Including the arch-heretic in Rome?\"\n\nIn 1969, Daniel Quilter Brown received episcopal consecration as an Old Catholic (English-line Old Catholic) bishop in the line of Arnold Harris Mathew. Brown had been born and raised a Roman Catholic, but became disenchanted with the reforms of Vatican II and chose to become an Old Roman Catholic bishop in order to perpetuate valid episcopal orders, believing that the Old Catholics still retained valid orders. Despite the fact that Bishop Brown obtained his consecration in the Old Catholic Church, he and his followers called themselves Roman Catholics and refused to use the title of \"Old Catholic\". Shortly after his consecration, he broke all ties and communications with the Old Catholics.\n\nBishop Brown soon became acquainted with Schuckardt and tried to persuade him to accept ordination from him. Later he proposed to consecrate Schuckardt to the episcopacy in addition to ordaining him to the priesthood. After Bishop Brown had repented of having received consecration from the Old Catholics, Schuckardt agreed to receive consecration from Bishop Brown: \"[T]hese past months have been spent in intense soul searching and continuous prayer to know and follow God's holy will. Thus I could not give you a reply until I felt fairly certain in my heart and mind. Now, finally, in concluding our novena in honor of the Annunciation, I have come to a decision. It is with holy trepidation that I accept your offer ...\" Between October 28 and November 1, 1971, Schuckardt was ordained and consecrated a bishop in a rented ballroom in Chicago, as they were not welcome in the churches of the Catholic Church.\n\nAt first Bishops Brown and Schuckardt worked peaceably together, but shortly thereafter went their separate ways. The \"Seattle Times\" references a letter written in 1973 by Bishop Brown in which he charges: \"Your group has become a personal cult of Francis Schuckardt and cannot call itself Catholic.\"\n\nA \"Spokesman Review\" article states that Schuckardt claimed to be the only true Catholic bishop. Schuckardt's officials deny that he ever made such a claim, and point to the fact that he directed his clergy to diligently search for Roman Catholic bishops who might qualify as legitimate in his eyes. \n\nBetween 1974 and 1979 Schuckardt ordained Denis Chicoine and five other clerics to the priesthood, who in turn helped him preserve the traditional Catholic faith primarily through the continued lecture circuit. In January 1978, the Fatima Crusade relocated to Mount Saint Michael, a former Jesuit scholasticate in Spokane, Washington.\n\nThe denomination was incorporated in 1978 as the \"Tridentine Latin Rite Catholic Church\", primarily to distinguish it from the \"Vatican II church\" (\"Tridentine\" relates to the 16th Ecumenical Council, the Council of Trent [also called Tridentium], which was held from 1545-63.) By 1977 the group had grown so large that they were able to purchase a former Jesuit seminary, Mount Saint Michael, just north of Spokane, Washington. The movement continued to grow, eventually sending priests to various parts of the world including Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and the Holy Land. According to a church publication, by 1981 the group had about 120 Sisters, 6 active priests, 61 Clerics and Brothers, a K - 12th grade boys and girls school, and a variety of organizations for the Church, including a convent for the mentally and neurologically impaired and a guild to aid the elderly and terminally ill. The same publication stated that running the church would be enough for a strong bishop, let alone one who \"is so physically ill, maliciously slandered and persecuted, betrayed at every turn, exhausted with work and His solicitude for his flock.\" In addition to Mount Saint Michael, they also owned over 18 other properties, collectively worth about eight million dollars.\n\nBrown consecrated Francis Schuckardt without a pontifical mandate (i.e. permission from the Pope), which is normally required by the Code of Canon Law under penalty of excommunication. However, traditionalists cite over a dozen historical instances where Bishops were legitimately consecrated in a period of \"sede vacante\". Traditionalists also point out the superiority of the essential doctrine of Apostolic Authority over the changeable dictates of ecclesiastical law, and hold that Christ would not leave his flock without shepherds.\n\nBishop Lawrence Welsh, Bishop of the Diocese of Spokane, wrote of Schuckardt in the Inland Register (a diocesan newspaper): \"Bishop Schuckardt has received no mission from the church universal and does not accept the unity of the apostolic office. Yet these are some of the very elements which make the Church Roman Catholic.\" In another section Bishop Welsh adds \"[T]hey deny the teaching authority of the Second Vatican Council and the last four Popes. Implicitly Bishop Schuckardt has set himself up as the final and last arbiter of Catholic tradition.\"\n\nAs related in a \"Spokesman Review\" article from 1983, Schuckardt is quoted as saying: \"Some of our teachers, studying the French revolution, saw the origins of the red, white, and blue, which was adopted then. The red represented the thousands of bishops and priests who were nailed to the church doors.\"\n\nMany of Schuckhardt's beliefs and policies drew criticism, including: \n\nIn April 1984, four former seminarians reported that they had been sexually abused by Schuckardt.\n\nOn June 3, 1984, Denis Chicoine made several public charges from the pulpit against Bishop Schuckardt, related in a \"Spokesman Review\" article on August 26, 1984.\n\nThe newspaper article cited Chicoine's claims: \"After we re-obtained possession of the Priory, and started to go through the boxes of mail that had been accumulated over the years and simply stacked in corners we found a large amount of cash and over $15,000 in out-of-date uncashed checks.\" \"For the past several years several things in the Community have been in complete and utter chaos.\" and that \"The vast majority of chaos is caused by Bishop Schuckardt's inability to physically function\" due to pain, lack of sleep, and medications.\n\n\"Chicoine has also charged that Schuckardt was sexually involved with some of his male assistants. He said he has several sworn statements.\" The article quotes Chicoine: \"I have in my possession sworn statements by several persons whom Bishop Schuckardt told personally that he was the Pope. These persons were told not to tell myself or other priests and clerics since we did not have the grace to accept it.\"\n\nSchuckardt left his Spokane mansion within days after Chicoine made his accusations public. Chicoine found that he had the backing of the vast majority of the religious and laity alike, and took charge of the Fatima Crusade.\n\nThe Schuckardt faction denies they are a cult.\n\nThe Schuckardt faction considers the Chicone faction in schism. Since both Bishop Schuckardt and Rev. Chicoine acknowledged no higher Church authority than Bishop Schuckardt himself, there was no lawful means whereby Rev. Chicoine could depose him and take control of the Tridentine Latin Rite Catholic Church as he did. Schuckardt formally excommunicated Chicoine on June 30, 1984. In the August 26 \"Spokesman Review\" article, Chicoine is quoted as saying: \"We contend that it is not a valid excommunication. If he is incompetent, which we believe we've proved, then his acts are null and void.\" Chicoine died on August 10, 1995 and is buried at Mount Saint Michael. His excommunication by Bishop Schuckardt was never revoked.\n\nIn an article by Tim Hanson that appeared in the \"Spokesman Review\" article on August 26, 1984 Schuckardt is quoted as saying: \"If there is some way I can just let the people know we didn't run away. We were sent away. We were thrown out of our home. If there was anyway we could have stayed there, we would have. They must know that it was made impossible.\" The article goes on to state that On June 7, 1984 Chicoine filed a lawsuit in Superior court asking that Schuckardt and 10 of his associates be prohibited from returning to the church property at Mount St. Michael's or Schuckardt's mansion at E2314 South Altamont Blvd. As a result of this lawsuit, a document was served at his mansion. The article states: \"Schuckardt said last week he thought the document was an eviction notice rather than an order to appear in court. He also believed an arrest warrant had been issued.\" Bruce Erickson, a Spokane attorney representing Chicoine stated: \"There wasn't any warrant out for his arrest. I or the court or the sheriff's department can't force them to read the documents\". Schuckardt left the mansion during the second week of June. The article went on \"[N]either Schuckardt nor a legal representative appeared in court. The court therefore issued an order banning the bishop from church property.\" Spokane County sheriff detectives confirmed that no warrant exists for Schuckardt. The court later ruled that Bishop Schuckardt had never been given proper legal notice of the pending action and overturned its original judgment against him and a handful of his followers.\n\nAfter leaving Spokane, they moved around and finally settled in Greenville, California. “One of the main reasons we move is because of the harassment we’ve been getting from Chicoine” stated loyal Bishop Schuckardt follower, Brother Mary Fidelis, “They’re trying to do anything they can to destroy us, literally. We fear harm, physical harm, coming to the Bishop. We wouldn’t put anything past them.” As further reported by Jim Sparks in the \"Spokesman Review\" \"In Greenville, Calif., northwest of Reno Nevada, Schuckardt appears to be king once again.\"\nSchuckardt and his followers continued to operate as the Tridentine Latin Rite Catholic Church while Chicoine reincorporated the group at Mount Saint Michael as the Latin Rite Catholic Church on June 14, 1984.\nOn May 9, 1987 a Plumas County, California Sheriff's Department SWAT team, with support from the California Highway Patrol, conducted a raid on the TLRCC Deputies searched Bishop Schuckardt's house and those of the Brothers and the nuns while a CHP helicopter hovered overhead to look for automatic weapons which the Chicoine faction falsely told them they possessed. They found illegal drugs along with precious metals in quantity, $75,000 in cash and about eight handguns and rifles in the three separate homes. Rather than going through a lengthy and expensive trial, Bishop Schuckardt accepted a plea bargain of attending a one-day drug-diversion class in exchange for all charges being dismissed against him.\nAll charges against the others arrested with Bishop Schuckardt were dismissed without prejudice. They furthermore obtained a “Factual Declaration of Innocence” regarding the same.\n\nThe Chicoine faction subsequently filed civil suits in five different states wherein the Schuckardt faction had assets, claiming that these assets belonged to his church, but lost all of these cases. The Schuckardt faction also challenged the civil suit filed by the Chicoine faction in Washington in 1984 and agreed to a settlement before the trial began in 1993. The settlement heavily favored the Chicoine faction. Nine years of legal wrangling finally came to an end, with the Chicoine faction getting the lion's share of the Fatima Crusade's assets.\n\nFor the remainder of his life Schuckardt lived in the Seattle area. As reported November 2005, the TLRCC has about 100 members in the area. The article states \"At the heart of the mysterious group lies its founder, Francis Konrad Schuckardt, a charismatic leader who considers himself to be the true Pope, according to members of the group.\" The church has no public address or telephone number.\n\nIn 2002 a reporter from \"The Seattle Times\" attempted to obtain an interview with Schuckardt for an article, but requests were denied because of health reasons, although the reporter was allowed to conduct an extensive interview with 6 Church members and given access to Church services.\n\nIn 2006 Schuckardt consecrated Andrew Jacobs (Brother Mary Fidelis) and Joseph Belzak (Brother John Francis Marie) as bishops.\n\nIn April 2006, Schuckardt was diagnosed with terminal cancer and died on November 5, 2006.\n\n"}

That version was recorded with drummer Scott Sundquist, but the version on \"Screaming Life\" was recorded with Cameron.\n\nSome time prior to recording, Endino found old rolls of quarter-inch tape at a garage sale, and some contained recordings of a Christian preacher giving sermons in the early 1950s. Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell had the idea to have the preacher's voice on \"Hand of God\". The recording was synched with the eight-track machine, copied to an empty track and by coincidence (or because, as Endino says, \"God smiled upon us\") the tape rolls matched perfectly with the song. Cornell also added his own sarcastic preacher-style vocals, with the lines \"Let it be known today, if you've got two hands/You're supposed to pray.\" According to Endino, the labels on the rolls of tape were near-illegible and thus the name of the preacher remains unknown.\n\nCornell said that the EP was met with rave reviews and that \"everybody loved it.\" \"Hunted Down\" was Soundgarden's first single and also the first song on Sub Pop's \"hold music\" tape. According to Thayil, \"you would call them up, and when they put you on hold you heard 'Hunted Down'.\" It was the only single released from the EP. \"Nothing to Say\" was Soundgarden's first B-side, released on the \"Hunted Down\" single. The song also appeared on the KCMU compilation tape, \"Bands That Will Make Money\", which was distributed to record companies. Upon hearing the song, record labels began contacting the band, which eventually led to the band signing with A&M Records.\n\nThe EP's cover art, photographed by Charles Peterson, features a sepia-toned black-and-white photograph of Cornell singing and Thayil playing guitar in the background. The album cover was an attempt by Sub Pop to capitalize on Cornell's image. The first 500<nowiki> </nowiki>copies of the EP were pressed on transparent orange vinyl; after that, they were released on standard black vinyl. A second pressing was later made, pressed by Erika Records, but still on the Sub Pop label, in black, sea green marble, blue marble, red, pink marble and purple marble vinyl.\n\nThe title of the EP inspired the title of a book of photography by Peterson, named \"Screaming Life: A Chronicle of the Seattle Music Scene\". Published in 1995, it is composed mainly of live photos taken by Peterson from the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s. Many of Peterson's photographs were used as album artwork for grunge bands. The book is accompanied by a CD, with nine songs selected by Peterson from bands of the era – Soundgarden's \"Entering\" is one of these songs.\n\nThe song \"Toy Box\" was recorded during the sessions for \"Screaming Life\". It was later featured on the \"Flower\" single. The instrumental track \"The Telephantasm\" was recorded mostly during these sessions and was released as a separate single in late 2010 and as an iTunes bonus track on \"Telephantasm\".\n\nSoundgarden\n\nProduction\n\n"}

Davis was an integral part of the successful Arsenal side of the late 1980s, and early 1990s, winning the League Cup in 1987 and the First Division in 1989 and 1991. He also won the Cup-Double in 1993 and the Cup-Winners Cup 1994. Davis appeared in total 447 times for Arsenal, scoring 30 goals in the League and 7 goals in the cups.\n\nBorn in Dulwich, London, Davis signed for Arsenal as an apprentice on 18 June 1979 and turned professional the following year. A talented left-footed midfielder, he made his debut in April 1980 in a North London derby against Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nIn the early days he had to battle for a midfield place against Liam Brady, Graham Rix, Brian Talbot and John Hollins. But Davis established himself in the 1981–82 season, and by the time of George Graham’s arrival at Highbury in the summer of 1986, Davis was the defined centrepiece of the Arsenal side.\n\nHe was a veteran in terms of individual deeds done and his importance to the club, yet still only 25 and without a major winners medal to his name. Davis, blessed with a wonderful left foot, startling on-pitch vision and unerring pass accuracy, was renowned for his calmness within the heat of a midfield battle. Elegant yet not unwilling to use force when needed, he was the perfect multi-purpose midfielder. In George Graham's first season in charge 1986–87, Davis had a great campaign. He formed a brilliant midfield partnership with Steve Williams, which was key to Arsenal beating Liverpool in the League Cup Final 2–1. Davis was in the side again in April 1988, bidding to retain the cup, but disappointingly lost 3–2 to Luton Town in the Final.\n\nOn 17 September 1988, three days after being an unused substitute for England at Wembley against Denmark, Davis punched Southampton player Glenn Cockerill in the jaw, during a 2–2 draw at Highbury. Cockerill's jaw was broken and following the FA's analysis of TV footage Davis was given a then unprecedented 9-match ban and £3,000 fine to him. Davis only played 12 league games, scoring once in the 1988–89 title winning season. Davis also suffered a bad thigh injury that plagued him for 18 months. So he missed the climax of the season at Anfield.\n\nDavis remained largely on the outside looking in throughout 1989–90, not appearing at all until Boxing Day as a combination of injuries, the drive of Michael Thomas and the consistency of Kevin Richardson left him frustrated on the sidelines. Within this, Davis relationship with Graham became strained. Yet, when the injuries began to mount up, toward the end of an unsuccessful defence of their title, Graham once again turned to Davis and it was within these last 5 games of the campaign that the subtleties he could offer attained a renewed value to the Gunners.\n\nHowever, after a spell on loan with Swedish club IFK Eskilstuna in June/July 1990, he returned to play a regular role in the 1990–91 title triumph.\n\nAlong with the signings of David Seaman and Anders Limpar, it was the rejuvenation of Davis during the 1990–91 season that led to Arsenal reclaiming the First Division title, absorbing only one defeat along the way. Davis missed only 1 League game of this season and won Football League XI recognition.\n\nAfter starting the 1991–92 season in the same form as he ended 1990–91, Davis again succumbed to an injury, which kept him out of the Arsenal side for over a year. With him went Arsenal's league consistency, as did his renewed claims to a place in the national team, having performed well while on duty for England B.\n\nWhen Davis finally returned from injury, fought his way back into the team, he did so just in time to lend a calming hand to Arsenal side for both the 1993 League Cup Final and that year's FA Cup Final, defeating Sheffield Wednesday on both occasions. The latter success completed Davis' full complement of major domestic winners medals.\n\nA year later, Davis added a European honour to his impressive list as Arsenal defeated a star-studded Parma side in the 1994 Cup Winners' Cup final. It was Davis last great night in an Arsenal shirt.\n\nThe signing of Stefan Schwarz in the summer of 1994 took Arsenal in a new direction and after only 6 appearances in 1994–95, some 15 years beyond his debut in that north London derby, he was released from the club on a free transfer in the wake of the arrival of Bruce Rioch as manager.\n\nAlthough selected for the England senior squad on several occasions, he never made an appearance for the senior team, despite 12-appearances for the Under-21 team, where he captained the side.\n\nAfter leaving Arsenal, he briefly joined Norwegian side Stabæk in 1995. After his spell at Stabæk, appearing in one game as a substitute, he returned to London to sign for Brentford on a free transfer in September 1995, but he retired within a year after just 8 appearances.\n\nDavis returned to Arsenal to become a youth coach in 1996, before leaving the club in 2003. In September 2003 Davis joined The Professional Footballers' Association coaching department. On 27 October 2005, Davis was invited to become assistant manager of Kettering Town by new manager Paul Gascoigne, he left Kettering at the same time as Gascoigne's departure from the club on 5 December 2005, despite being asked to stay on, but he chose to return to the PFA where he worked in coach education and equality until February 2016. As of July 2008, he was working as the PFA's Regional Coach South East.\n\nIn March 2016, Davis joined the FA where he continues to work with the elite coach development team. Davis has studied and gained the FA and Pro UEFA Coaching awards, the highest coaching award in the U.K. along with his UEFA 'A' Licence and the FA Diploma in Football Management from Warwick University, as well as his coach educators awards. Davis is now a senior coach/coach educator for the organisation and he is also an ambassador for the 'Kick It Out' and 'Show Racism the Red Card organisations'.\n\nArsenal\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2055880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055880", "title": "Clark International Airport", "text": "Clark International Airport\n\nClark International Airport (, ) is an international airport located within the Clark Freeport Zone between Angeles and Mabalacat in the province of Pampanga, Philippines. It is located northwest of Manila. It is accessible through the Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway.\n\nThe airport serves Central Luzon, Northern Luzon, and to an extent Metro Manila. The name is derived from the former American Clark Air Base which was the largest overseas base of the United States Air Force until it was closed in 1991 and handed over to the Government of the Philippines.\n\nThe airport is managed and operated by Luzon International Premiere Airport Development (LIPAD) Corporation, a consortium of JG Summit Holdings, Filinvest Development Corporation, Philippine Airport Ground Support Solutions Inc., and Changi Airports Philippines Pte. Ltd.; while the southern part of the facility is utilized by the Philippine Air Force as Clark Air Base.\n\nThe airport serves both international and domestic flights. A new passenger terminal building is under construction and is expected to be finished in 2020.\n\nThe United States Cavalry established Fort Stotsenberg in 1902 and later converted a portion of which into an air field, which was, in turn, renamed Clark Air Field in 1919—in honor of aviator Major Harold Melville Clark—and was used as one of the most important overseas bases during the 2nd World War.\n\nIn 1947, the RP-US Military Bases Agreement was signed, integrating Clark Air Field and Fort Stotsenberg into Clark Air Base but, after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 and the non-renewal of the military bases agreement, Clark Air Base was reverted to the Philippine Government.\n\nThe Bases Conversion Development Act of 1992 accelerated the conversion of Clark Air Base into a Special Economic Zone, and in 2007, the Philippine Congress enacted a law (RA 9400) which renamed the base to Clark Freeport Philippines. It is now segregated in two separate entities: Clark Freeport Zone administered by the Clark Development Corporation, and the Clark Civil Aviation Complex administered by the Clark International Airport Corporation.\n\nIn 1993, the former Clark Air Base was reopened as the Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ) after the area was cleared from lahar debris from the Mount Pinatubo explosion and a typhoon that followed. During the administration of President Fidel V. Ramos, it was designated to be the future primary international gateway of the Philippines and the major international airport of Metro Manila and its neighboring provinces when Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Metro Manila has reached full capacity and can no longer be expanded.\n\nCIAC traces its origin from Republic Act No. 7227, otherwise known as the \"Bases Conversion and Development Act of 1992\", which authorized the conversion of several military reservations, including the former Clark Air Base, into sustainable economic zones. Jurisdiction over the corporation shifted from the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA) and the Clark Development Corporation (CDC) since its formal incorporation with the SEC in 1995.\n\nIn 2003, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo renamed Clark International Airport as the Diosdado Macapagal International Airport (DMIA), in memory of her father, former President Diosdado Macapagal, and ordered the Clark International Airport Corporation (CIAC) in February 2007 to fund the US$1.7 billion (PH₱76.5 billion) expansion of DMIA and the approval of a US$2 million (PH₱90 million) study plan financed by the Korean International Cooperation Agency. The first stage of Clark Airport's expansion program, a PH₱130 million terminal expansion, was completed in January 2008 to accommodate more than 2 million passengers annually.\n\nIn 2011, CIAC was transferred from the Bases Conversion and Development Authority and became an attached agency of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) by virtue of Executive Order No. 64 issued by President Benigno Aquino III.\n\nThe airport's name reverted to Clark International Airport in February 2012, but the passenger terminal continued to bear Diosdado Macapagal's name.\n\nOn 28 February 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte issued Executive Order No. 14, reverting CIAC as a subsidiary of the BCDA, but with the Department of Transportation maintaining supervision and operational control of the airport.\n\nOn 22 April 2019, the airport was temporarily closed as all flights to and from Clark are canceled due to a magnitude 6.1 earthquake occurred, originating in Zambales. The earthquake caused heavy damage to the main terminal as the ceiling collapsed, rendering the airport temporarily closed. It reopened on 24 April 2019, after repairs were made.\n\nFour new terminals are expected to be completed and all will be fully operational by 2025. Upon completion, these four terminals will boost Clark's passenger capacity to more than 110 million annually. The airport is also being groomed to become one of the country's first \"aerotropolis\" or a community that features a world-class airport and surrounded by business clusters and residential developments. The project involves the operations and maintenance of the existing and the proposed new passenger terminal buildings on the airport with a 25-year concession period. The ₱12.55-billion project involves the construction of a new 82,600m² passenger terminal building with a design capacity of 8 million passengers per annum. The new passenger terminal building is expected to be finished by 2020.\n\nNorth Luzon Airport Consortium (NLAC), which is a consortium of JG Summit Holdings, Filinvest Development Corp., Philippine Airport Ground Support Solutions Inc. and Changi Airports Philippines Pte. Ltd. (which is a subsidiary of Changi Airports International Pte. Ltd, which is itself a subsidiary of Changi Airport Group, one of the operators of Singapore Changi Airport) won the open bid by the BCDA to take over the operations and maintenance of the airport. On 25 January 2019, NLAC signed the 25-year contract for the operations and maintenance for the airport. On 16 August 2019, Clark International Airport's operations and maintenance were officially handed over to the winning bid (now renamed as Luzon International Premiere Airport Development (LIPAD) Corporation) in the ceremony held at the new terminal building with the unveiling of its new logo.\n\nClark International Airport is located in Luzon Island, approximately from Manila in the south, from Baguio in the north, and a substantial portion of which is surrounded by Angeles. The airport lies in between the Mount Pinatubo on the West and the Mount Arayat on the East.\n\nThe airport site is inside the Clark Freeport Zone's Civil Aviation Complex which occupies and directly linked to the Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway (SCTEx) which is connected to the North Luzon Expressway (NLEx) providing a direct link to Metro Manila.\n\nIt has a local catchment area with an estimated population of 23 million covering Regions 1, 2 and 3, Cordillera Administrative Region, and the northern part of Metro Manila (Quezon City and CAMANAVA area).\n\nThe original terminal was expanded for $3 million (PH₱130 million) to accommodate 1 million passengers annually. The expansion project was inaugurated by President Arroyo on April 2008 to serve the growing passenger volume due to the entry of foreign and local budget carriers at the airport.\n\nPhase I expansion started in April 2010 for $12 million (PH₱550 million) that saw a second story, arrival and departure lounges, and two aerobridges added to the terminal building. The expansion boosted Clark's capacity to 2.5 million annually.\n\nIn 2013, Phase II expansion which costs $9.6 million (PH₱417 million) increased the capacity of the passenger terminal from 2.5 million to 4.2 million passengers per annum. The expansion increased the size of the passenger terminal building from 11,439m² to 19,799m². It added 21 new check-in counters, increasing the total number of counters from 13 to 34. Five arrival counters and 12 departures counters were also constructed. The expanded terminal currently has eight entry points and three customs stations. The modernized terminal started operations in May 2013.\n\nClark Airport used to have two 3,200-meter parallel runways. Since the runways are closely spaced, the secondary runway (02L/20R) has been decommissioned and is no longer in use. A new maintenance hangar is currently being constructed on the stopway of Runway 02L.\n\nSince , all international flights have been suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n<br>\n\nData from Clark International Airport Corporation (CIAC).\n\n\nThe Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEx) provides access through the airport, with two exits: Clark North and Clark South interchange, where the latter leads directly to Clark. Passengers with connecting flights at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Metro Manila can take North Luzon Expressway which is linked via SCTEx, then passing through Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, Roxas Boulevard and finally onto NAIA Road. The future corridor between NAIA and Clark International Airport is the Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3 from NLEx to SLEx and NAIA Expressway from Skyway and SLEx to NAIA Terminals. The target completion of the NLEx-SLEx elevated expressway link project (Skyway Stage 3) was initially March 2018, but it was moved to the 2020 completion date due to right of way issues.\n\nPark and fly services are provided within the airport as well.\n\nFor short-distance routes, air-conditioned jeepneys connect Clark to nearby Dau Bus Terminal in Mabalacat and SM City Clark in Angeles, Pampanga. From Dau, passengers can ride intercity buses leading to other cities and towns in Northern and Central Luzon as well as Metro Manila. Direct Premium Point-to-Point Bus Services (P2Ps) for long-distance routes are provided by four bus companies leading to TriNoma in Quezon City, Subic and neighboring Olongapo in Zambales, Dagupan in Pangasinan, and Vigan in Ilocos Sur.\n\nThe airport will also be served by the second phase of the North–South Commuter Railway, connecting the airport to a terminus in nearby New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac, as well as Tutuban train station in Manila and Calamba in Laguna. The connection will be complete by 2023.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2055881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055881", "title": "Undue influence", "text": "Undue influence\n\nIn jurisprudence, undue influence is an equitable doctrine that involves one person taking advantage of a position of power over another person. This inequity in power between the parties can vitiate one party's consent as they are unable to freely exercise their independent will.\n\nWhere it is established that a plaintiff was induced to enter into a contract or transaction by the undue influence of the defendant, the contract may be rendered voidable. If undue influence is proved in a contract, the innocent party is entitled to set aside the contract against the defendant, and the remedy is rescission.\n\nAs the law of undue influence was applied and developed by the Court of Chancery, it developed into two distinct classes: ‘actual’ undue influence and ‘presumed’ undue influence. \n\nIn Australia, the leading case on undue influence is \"Johnson v Buttress\" (1936), in which the approach to 'actual' and 'presumed' undue influence was at issue. \n\nIn the first subgroup, the relationship falls in a class of relationships that as a matter of law will raise a presumption of undue influence. Such classes include:\n\n\nIn such cases, the burden of proof lies on the first of said parties (e.g. the government, parent, or doctor) to disprove undue influence on the second party. This requires the dominant party to establish that the second party \"knew and understood what he or she was doing, and that he or she was acting independently of the influence of the dominant party\". One influential factor in deciding whether the second party was acting independently is whether he or she was given an independent advice, while such an advice is not indispensable for rebutting the presumption.\n\nThe second subgroup covers relationships that do not fall into the first subgroup, but on the facts of case, there was an relationship between the parties that led to undue influence. The test is one of whether \"one party occupies or assumes towards another a position naturally involving an ascendancy or influence over that other, or a dependence or trust on his part\". If the plaintiff satisfies this a presumption of undue influence will arise, to which the onus of proof transfers to the defendant, who thereon, must rebut that \"in all the circumstances\", the relationship between the parties involved \"dealings were at arm's length and that the other’s will was in no way overborne by the relationship of confidence\" that existed.\n\nAn innocent party may also seek to have a contract set aside for actual undue influence, where there is no presumption of undue influence, but there is evidence that the power was unbalanced at the time of the signing of the contract. Factors such as age, mental capacity and literacy of the donee, among other considerations such as the nature of the transaction (fair or unfair) will help determine actual undue influence.\nThere is no requirement of manifest disadvantage.\n\nIn \"Farmers' Co-Op Executors & Trustees v Perks\", a wife transferred her interest as tenant in common on a farming property to her husband; the property was owned jointly by the husband and herself. There was evidential proof that there was a long history of brutal domestic violence inflicted by the husband on the wife, whereby he ended up murdering her. There was a presumption that the wife only transferred her interest to the husband because of undue influence and evidence proved that the transfer resulted from actual undue influence. It was because of the history of violence that resulted in the judge setting aside the transfer.\n\nA contrasting case is \"Lee v Chai\", in which Mr Lee purchased an apartment and a Porsche for Ms Chai, with whom he was having an affair. Mr Lee argued that the gifts were given as a result of undue influence, and as such should be set aside. It was held that Mr Lee and Ms Chai were not in a relationship of influence that would attract the operation of the equitable doctrine. Mr Lee was a well-educated man with substantial experience in business affairs, while Ms Chai had a 'less forceful personality' and less business experience. This case highlights an approach taken in Australia, which is to focus on the impaired consent of the plaintiff. Deane J in \"Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio\" said 'Undue influence, like common law duress, looks to the quality of the consent or assent of the weaker party'.\n\nIn \"Garcia v National Australia Bank\" (1998), the High Court of Australia approved the principle in \"Yerkey v Jones\", by distinguishing between cases of actual undue influence and situations where the transaction is set aside because the guarantor does not understand the nature of the transaction. Although there is no presumption of undue influence, a \"lender is to be taken to have understood that, as a wife, the surety may repose trust and confidence in her husband in matters of business and therefore to have understood that the husband may not fully and accurately explain the purport and effect of the transaction to his wife; and yet ... did not itself take steps to explain the transaction to the wife or find out that a stranger had explained it to her.\"\n\n\"Undue influence\" is the most common ground for will contests and are often accompanied by a capacity challenge. That is, someone in possession of full mental capacity is not likely to be swayed by undue influence, manipulation, or coercion. In litigation most jurisdictions place the burden of proving undue influence on the party challenging the will. Undue influence can be very difficult to prove, and the mere appearance of undue influence is inadequate to challenge the validity of a will.\n\nIn probate law, undue influence is generally defined as a testator's loss of free agency regarding property disposition through contemporaneous psychological domination by an advisor, resulting in an excessive benefit to the advisor. It is important to note that \"undue influence\" is an issue only when the advisor is benefiting, not when advisor is getting a benefit for someone else; in that case it would be considered fraud.\n\nIn Germany, to avoid undue influence it is illegal for a testator who is or has been a resident of a nursing home to bequeath any property to any employee of the nursing home.\n\n"}

It was published by Sega and released for the Master System in 1989 and for the Game Gear in 1992 as Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap. It was ported by Hudson Soft and released in 1991 for the TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine under the name Dragon's Curse. It was also ported in 1993 by Brazilian company Tec Toy under the title Turma da Mônica em o Resgate, with the game retooled to include characters from Brazilian comic book series \"Monica's Gang\" (\"Turma da Mônica\"). A remake developed by Lizardcube and published by DotEmu, titled \"\", was released in April 2017.\n\nThe game takes place after the events of \"Wonder Boy in Monster Land\", in which Wonder Boy has been cursed by the Mecha Dragon and must locate the Salamander Cross to lift it. The game is nonlinear and features varying landscapes in which players must navigate. Players find items and clues needed to access different parts of Monster Land, and they can transform into other forms and gain different abilities.\n\n\"Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap\" received wide acclaim from gaming magazines upon its release. It was praised for its colorful and cartoon-like graphics, rich sound and diverse sound effects, and varied and addictive gameplay. Criticisms include sprite flickering in the Master System version as well as slippery controls. It won \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s \"Best Game of the Year\" award for the Master System in 1989. Reviews from gaming magazines have described the game as one of the best Master System and 8-bit titles of all time.\n\n\"Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap\" takes place immediately after the events of \"Wonder Boy in Monster Land\", Wonder Boy travels into the Mecha Dragon's lair in order to slay him. (Some sources refer to this creature as the \"MEKA dragon\".) However, upon doing so, he is inflicted by a curse that transforms him into \"Lizard-Man\". In the game, the player controls Wonder Boy as he tries to undo this curse by journeying across the land, defeating other dragons, and finally defeating the Vampire Dragon to obtain the Salamander Cross – the only object that can remove his curse.\n\nAfter completing the first level in the game (a simplified version of the final level from the preceding game \"Wonder Boy in Monster Land\"), the player begins as Lizard-Man from Alsedo, a town in Monster Land, and the gameplay becomes nonlinear. From there, the player explores and finds items and clues needed for Wonder Boy to access different parts of Monster Land. Gold and additional secondary items can be found by defeating enemies and opening treasure chests. With gold, players can buy additional items and better equipment in shops and restore their life meter in hospitals. Items with question marks displayed cannot be bought unless the player has \"charm\", which can be increased by collecting Charm Stones or by equipping certain items.\nIn the game, the player uses the directional pad to move Wonder Boy left or right, crouch down (only possible as Hu-Man or Lizard-Man), or to enter doors. The buttons on the controller are used to attack enemies and to jump. Wonder Boy can attack with his main weapon or with secondary weapons by holding down on the directional pad and pressing the attack button. Pressing the pause button brings up the Status Screen (and pauses the game if Wonder Boy is fighting a dragon). Wonder Boy has a life meter shown on the top of the gameplay area as a series of hearts. When all hearts turn black, Wonder Boy dies and the game ends, but if he has a life potion (\"medicine vial\" in \"Dragon's Curse\") remaining, he will revive with some of the hearts refilled. After the game ends, the player is taken to a \"continue screen\"; there the player has an opportunity to win a free life potion before restarting the game at the town. Players can visit the town's church to receive a password in order to continue the game at a later time. The password saves the player's current form, equipment, and amount of gold; but it does not save any secondary weapons or life potions in stock. \"Dragon's Curse\" has a \"file cabinet\" which allows players to store passwords into the game's memory.\n\nThroughout the game, players go through differently-themed levels: underwater, desert, jungle, cave, and sky. At the end of each level is a different dragon. After defeating a dragon, Wonder Boy changes form, and his abilities change. Wonder Boy begins the game as Hu-Man, equipped with all eight hearts and the strongest equipment. He turns into Lizard-Man after defeating and being cursed by the Mecha Dragon in the first level. At that point, he loses all equipment and all hearts except one. Lizard-Man attacks enemies by breathing fire at them and he can duck, but must use his fire breath to defend against enemy projectiles as he does not hold a shield in front of him. He can assume other different forms throughout the game: Mouse-Man can walk on walls and ceilings designated by checkered \"mouse blocks\", Piranha-Man can swim freely underwater and can access underwater places (such as the ship) which the other forms cannot, Lion-Man attacks enemies with his sword by slashing from directly above to directly below him allowing him to attack targets other forms cannot hit because all of them except for Lizard-Man simply thrust their sword, and Hawk-Man can fly freely in the air but takes damage if he enters water.\n\n\"Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap\" was developed by Westone and was published by Sega; it is the sequel to \"Wonder Boy in Monster Land\". It was first released for the Master System in 1989 in North America and Europe. The game was then released to the PC Engine in Japan under the title \"Adventure Island\" (not to be confused with the \"Adventure Island\" series of games for the Nintendo Entertainment System); it was released for the TurboGrafx-16 that same year by NEC under the title \"Dragon's Curse\". Westone allowed Hudson Soft to publish the game provided they made no reference to the \"Wonder Boy\" series. Sega then released the game for the Game Gear in 1992 in Europe under the game's original title (excluding the roman numeral \"III\") and in Japan under the title \"Monster World II: Dragon no Wana\". In 1993, Tec Toy released the game in Brazil for the Master System under the title \"Turma da Mônica em o Resgate\". Tec Toy replaced the sprites with characters from Brazilian comic book series \"Monica's Gang\" (\"Turma da Mônica\"), so instead of the player character turning into different creatures, he gets turned into different characters from the comics, relaying between them in order to rescue Monica, who disappeared after the previous game. In 2007, Sega released the game in Japan for the PlayStation 2 as part of a compilation of all the \"Wonder Boy\" games titled \"Sega Ages 2500 Vol. 29: Monster World Complete Collection\". During the same year, \"Dragon's Curse\"/\"Adventure Island\" was released for the Wii's Virtual Console service worldwide. The Master System version of \"Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap\" was released in Europe on and in North America on .\n\n\"Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap\" received wide acclaim from critics upon release. It received coverage in the September 1989 issue of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", where they provided a brief overview of the game and a summary of the events in \"Wonder Boy in Monster Land\" leading up to the game's plot. Two months later, in its December 1989 issue in its \"Best and Worst of 1989\", the game won an award for \"Best Game of the Year\" for the Sega Master System. \"GamePro\" gave a brief overview of the game in its September–October 1989 issue, adding that \"it's truly an adventure worthy of \"Wonder Boy\"\". It received extensive coverage in both the January and February 1990 issues of \"VideoGames & Computer Entertainment\", featuring an overview and a walkthrough of the game. The magazine praised the game for its challenge and overall look, which it says \"will have you manipulating your control pad for days on end\".\n\nVarious UK-based video gaming magazines gave \"Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap\" significant coverage. UK magazines \"Computer and Video Games\" and its spin-off \"Mean Machines\" – in the latter's premiere issue – gave the game positive reviews. \"Computer and Video Games\" praised the animation in particular and called it the best game of its type on that platform, using phrases such as \"familiar air of polish and ingenuity\" and \"piles of addiction guaranteed\". \"Mean Machines\" Matt Regan said it \"ranks as one of the greatest Sega Master System games ever!\"; he compared the gameplay to the \"Mario\" series of video games and praised the game's depth, saying that \"there's always something new to discover, be it a key to a previously locked door or even a secret room!\" Julian Rignall praised the game's graphics and the huge world players can explore, which he says contributes to the game's addictiveness. He said that \"the combination of adventuring, shooting and platform action results in one of the best games of its type available on any console\". Collectively, they praised the game overall presentation and graphics, saying that the sprites complement the background. While they additionally praised its playability for being \"accessible from the word go\" and longevity, they criticized its sound, saying that it \"could have been much better\".\n\n\"The Games Machine\" complimented the game's colorful backgrounds and sprites with \"the [Wonder] Boy himself being particularly well-drawn\", while they criticized the Master System version's weak animation on some of the characters as well as its choppy scrolling. They called it one of the best Master System games but complained that it was expensive, saying \"do you really want to spend 28 quid on it?\" The magazine's review of the PC Engine version in the same issue was more positive. The magazine's successor, \"Raze\", reviewed the PC Engine version titled \"Adventure Island\". The magazine praised the game's simplistic and addictive platforming gameplay and its smooth-scrolling graphics, though they said they were \"a little blocky\". They noted that the game had excellent music which was \"worth listening through some headphones\". \"Zero\", along with praising the game's graphics and music, called it \"enormously addictive\"; the review said the ability to transform into different forms and hence being able to progress into new areas kept the game fresh.\n\nGerman magazine \"Video Games\" gave \"Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap\" a positive review, saying that the game gave more weight to strategy and tactics, that it \"stands out clearly from the two predecessors\", and that its graphics became less childlike but more \"spectacular\". The review continued, saying that its gameplay is a good example of what makes action-adventure games addictive to play. It complimented the game's depth and wide array of equipment, saying that it \"provides an additional touch, which makes [it] the best thought-out game [at the time]\".\n\nUpon the release of the TurboGrafx-16 version \"Dragon's Curse\" to the Virtual Console in 2007, IGN's Lucas Thomas reviewed the game, comparing the opening sequence of the game to the opening sequence of \"\"; he proceeded to add that the game parallels with games in the \"Castlevania\" series, calling the game \"a straightforward and simple 'Metroidvania' adventure\" but with \"several layers of unexpected depth\". Thomas noted the game's popularity among fans and that it plays almost exactly the same as the Master System version despite graphics and sound improvements; at the time, there were no Master System games on the Virtual Console. He praised the game's rich sound, gameplay depth, and \"colorful and cartoony\" graphics, which \"was perfectly suited to the TurboGrafx platform\".\n\nIGN's Travis Fahs, in discussing the SMS version, offered another opinion, praising the game as \"not only the crowning achievement of the series, but perhaps one the best games of the 8-bit era\", drawing comparisons to both \"Mario\" and \"Zelda\". Thomas again reviewed the Master System version of \"Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap\" when it was released two years later for the Virtual Console. In this review, he compares the gameplay to \"Metroid\" – more specifically the need to gather additional equipment and abilities to advance in the game. While he acknowledged that this version from one of the best Master System games as well as for any 8-bit system, he felt that the Master System's Virtual Console release had a reduced appeal. He said that the TurboGrafx-16 version \"Dragon's Curse\" had already been out for two years and that there was no difference in gameplay between the two versions, but there were improvements in graphics and sound in the TurboGrafx-16 version because of the system's superior capabilities. He also noted that the Master System version suffers from sprite flickering – something the TurboGrafx-16 version did not have. Despite the small differences in the two versions, he decided to give the Master System version the same rating as the TurboGrafx-16 version.\n\nAllgame's review of the Master System version praised the non-linear gameplay and the ability to change into different forms, saying that it \"keeps things interesting and fun\" and \"keeps the game from getting repetitive\". It lauded its visuals and sound effects, saying the \"graphics are very colorful and have a cartoon look to them\". Criticisms included slippery controls and the difficulty of getting into doors; it said the controls kept the game from obtaining a perfect rating, and the gameplay was still not as good as \"Wonder Boy in Monster Land\". The editing staff from magazine \"Retro Gamer\" listed \"Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap\" as one of the \"Perfect Ten Games\" for the Master System, calling it \"the best in a long and highly convoluted myriad of multi-titled games\" and \"a great adventure that every Master System fan needs to own\". The review praised the game's brisk pace and gameplay, despite the length of the game.\n\nIn June 2016, indie developer Lizardcube and publisher DotEmu announced a remake of \"Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap\", simply titled \"\", which was released for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One in April 2017, with a release on PC to follow in June 2017. The game supports a different, modern visual style, but retains the same gameplay, level design and story. The game was developed in collaboration with series creator Ryuichi Nishizawa. A spiritual successor to \"The Dragon's Trap\", titled \"Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom\", is also developed by Game Atelier and published by FDG Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC. The game is also developed in collaboration with Nishizawa, though does not use the \"Wonder Boy\" name due to Sega owning the rights.\n\n\n"}

It was adopted in the reign of Empress Suiko. The emphasis of the document is not so much on the basic laws by which the state was to be governed, such as one may expect from a modern constitution, but rather it was a highly Buddhist and Confucian document that focused on the morals and virtues that were to be expected of government officials and the emperor's subjects to ensure a smooth running of the state, where the emperor was to be regarded as the highest authority. It is one of the earliest constitutions in history. \n\nThe constitution contains the same number of precepts as the Seventeen Rules of Enjuin.\n\nThe degree to which the document matches the definition of a \"constitution\" is debated. While it introduces principles of governance much like the preamble of modern constitutions such as the United States Constitution, it lacks other elements commonly expected. As William Theodore de Bary writes, “Prince Shotoku's ‘constitution’, placed more emphasis on basic moral and spiritual values than on the detailed codification of laws and their enforcement\".\n\nThis constitution remained valid until Ritsuryō went into effect in the late seventh century. It is frequently argued that those aspects not contradicted by any subsequent legislation were still considered valid in 1890, and remain so today. Conservative commentator Kase Hideaki also argues that because it has never been explicitly abolished, it is still partially valid.\n"}
{"id": "2055899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055899", "title": "Arthur Dove", "text": "Arthur Dove\n\nArthur Garfield Dove (August 2, 1880 – November 23, 1946) was an American artist. An early American modernist, he is often considered the first American abstract painter. Dove used a wide range of media, sometimes in unconventional combinations, to produce his abstractions and his abstract landscapes. \"Me and the Moon\" from 1937 is a good example of an Arthur Dove abstract landscape and has been referred to as one of the culminating works of his career. Dove did a series of experimental collage works in the 1920s. He also experimented with techniques, combining paints like hand mixed oil or tempera over a wax emulsion as exemplified in Dove's 1938 painting \"Tanks\", in the collection of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nDove was born to a wealthy family in Canandaigua, New York. His parents, William George and Anna Elizabeth, were of English ancestry. William Dove was interested in politics and named his son Arthur Garfield, after the Republican candidates for President and Vice-President in the 1880 election, James Garfield and Chester Arthur, who ultimately won the vote. Arthur Dove grew up loving the outdoors on a farm; however, his father was a very successful businessman who owned a brickyard (along with city real estate) and expected his son to become wealthy. Dove's childhood interests included playing the piano, painting lessons, and being a pitcher on a high school baseball team. As a child, he was befriended by a neighbor, Newton Weatherby, a naturalist who helped form Dove's appreciation of nature. Weatherby was also an amateur painter who gave Dove pieces of leftover canvas to work with.\n\nDove attended Hobart College and Cornell University, and graduated from Cornell in 1903. Dove was chosen to illustrate the Cornell University yearbook. Dove's illustrations proved popular because they brought life to the characters and situations they depicted. After graduation, he became a well known commercial illustrator in New York City, working for \"Harper's Magazine\" and \"The Saturday Evening Post\". Dove's parents were upset at his choice to become an artist, instead of a more profitable profession that his Ivy League degree would have enabled, and they would prove unsympathetic to the difficulties that came with a career in art.\n\nIn 1907, Dove and his first wife, Florence, traveled to France and moved to Paris, then the world's art capital. They made short trips to both Italy and Spain. While there, Dove joined a group of experimental artists from the United States, which included Alfred Henry Maurer. Dove and Maurer remained friends until Maurer's suicide in 1932. While in Europe, Dove was introduced to new painting styles, in particular the Fauvist works of Henri Matisse, and he exhibited at the annual Autumn Salon in 1908 and 1909. Feeling a clearer sense as an artist, he returned to New York. His return to commercial illustration was unsatisfying, so Dove moved out of New York to make a living off farming and fishing while devoting the rest of his time to painting. His son, William C. Dove, was born on July 4, 1909.\n\nWhen Dove returned to America in 1909 he met Alfred Stieglitz, probably by way of Maurer's written introduction. Stieglitz was a well known photographer and gallery owner who was very active in promoting modern art in America, including works by European artists that had never been seen before in the U.S. Dove decided to quit working as an illustrator but was in need of artistic identity along with emotional bolstering and Stieglitz filled both these roles. The photographer was 16 years older than Dove and his urban, Jewish and European cultural roots were in contrast to Dove's rural Anglo-Saxon Protestant heritage. Dove was said to be gentle, quiet, and a good friend while Stieglitz was known as being argumentative and shrewd. They found their common ground in the idea that art forms should embody modern spiritual values, not materialism and tradition. With Stieglitz's support, Dove produced what are known as the first purely abstract paintings to come out of America. Dove's works were based on natural forms and he referred to his type of abstraction as “extraction” where, in essence, he extracted the essential forms of a scene from nature.\n\nDove exhibited his works at Stieglitz's 291 gallery in 1910 as part of the show \"Younger American Painters\", which also included Dove's old friend Maurer. Dove showed one painting, a large still life painted in France entitled “The Lobster”, which would be his last representational work. Stieglitz provided Dove with his first one-man show in 1912 at the 291. The show, which included a group of Dove's pastels that came to be known as \"The Ten Commandments\", was the first public exhibition of abstract art by an American. In the two years after meeting Stieglitz, Dove became a leader in international art developments. From 1912 to 1946 Dove showed his work annually at Stieglitz's galleries: 291, Intimate Gallery, and An American Place. Dove used a wide range of media over the course of his career, sometimes in unconventional combinations. During the 1920s Dove made many works on paper such as the pastel on paper, \"Nature Symbolized (or Reefs)\" from 1924. As stated above Dove did experimental collage works in the 1920s in works like \"The Critic,\" 1925, and \"The Intellectual\" 1925; and he experimented with techniques, combining paints like oil and/or tempera over a wax emulsion. \"Tanks\", 1938 is an example of oil over a wax emulsion; commenting about \"Tanks,\" the Boston Museum of Fine Arts says: \"Set off by a halo of pale gray, the quivering structures almost seem to dematerialize and merge into the surrounding scenery, yet at the same time, they retain their hulking forms.\"\n\nIn spite of support from various members of the art community, it was often necessary for Dove to earn money through farming, fishing and commercial illustration. Dove's most consistent supporter was Duncan Phillips, founder of the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., which now holds the majority of Dove's work. Dove's work convinced Philips that abstract was an artistic process, not just an art style. Stieglitz's gallery was first visited by Phillips because of Dove, and he continued to return to see Dove's work. In exchange for first choice of paintings from each exhibition, Phillips paid Dove a commission of $50.00 a month. Dove met Phillips only once in his lifetime, in 1936. In 1937 Phillips purchased \"Goin Fishin\" for $2,000.00, then the largest sum paid for any of Dove's work. Phillips also purchased “Huntington Harbor 1.” Dove produced about twenty-five assemblages between 1924 and 1930.\n\nDove spent seven years on a houseboat called \"Mona\" with Helen Torr, known as \"Reds\" for the fiery color of her hair. Torr was also a painter. Although the psychological consequences benefited Dove's art, his life with Torr was difficult. Florence Dove had never cared about Dove's passion for art, and was more socially inclined. After 25 years of marriage, Dove left Florence. Florence would not grant him a divorce and flatly refused to let him see his son. When he departed, he left behind everything except his copies of \"Camera Work\" and Stieglitz's letters.\n\nWhen Florence died unexpectedly, Dove paid $250 for the funeral expenses and sent flowers, but did not go to the funeral in Geneva. Although distressed about her death, he was now able to see his son and marry Torr. For the first time in eight years, Dove met with his then nineteen-year-old son, Bill, who was also an artist. The two established a friendship and later in life his son helped Dove with creating a technique for silvering frames.\n\nDove and Torr were not able to wed immediately as Torr had not divorced her first husband. They did eventually marry in April 1932 in the New York City Hall with a brief service and using a dimestore ring. Dove identified himself as a \"frame maker\" on his marriage registry. The 1933 Gallery 291 exhibition was the only time Stieglitz allowed Torr and Dove to exhibit together. \"Seven Americans\" brought Dove back into the coverage of major newspapers and art magazines, as well as back into the public eye. His work influenced later abstract landscape painters, such as Julian Hatton and Georgia O'Keeffe, in having \"an unbridled love of pure, hot color.\"\n\nIn July 1924 when Arthur Dove and Helen Torr sailed into Huntington Harbor aboard their 42-foot yawl, \"Mona,\" they could not have anticipated the extent to which Long Island’s North Shore would inspire some of their greatest paintings. They lived in Halesite until the Great Depression when both Dove and Torr moved back to Dove's estate located in Geneva.\n\nWishing to return to Long Island, in 1938 the couple moved back into their first home, a former post office and general store on Center Shore Road in Centerport, New York. They purchased the house for $980.00. The tiny, one-room cottage stood on the edge of the Titus Mill Pond. Almost immediately, Dove was found to have pneumonia; he eventually suffered from a heart attack and was diagnosed with a debilitating kidney disorder. In terrible health for the remainder of his days, he lived quietly, finally able to devote himself entirely to painting, and focus on the inspiration of his surroundings and his home. Some of the most powerful paintings of his career, including \"Indian Summer,\" were painted in Centerport. Torr remained in the house on the millpond but never painted again. Helen Torr died in 1967. In 1979, her works and Dove's were hung together in the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\n\nThe Arthur Dove-Helen Torr Cottage was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.\n\nDove suffered from heart disease and Bright's disease through the late 1930s. He suffered a heart attack in 1939 and his health never fully recovered. In 1946 Dove had his last show with nine new paintings and made his final visit to the gallery and saw Stieglitz for the last time. In July of that year their first grandchild Toni was born. A little more than a month after the show closed in July, Stieglitz died of heart failure. Badly shaken from his friend's death, Dove lived for only four more months. Although he became partially paralyzed by a stroke, he continued with Torr's help by guiding the brush as he painted until he collapsed and died at Huntington Hospital. Arthur Dove died on November 23, 1946 following a second heart attack and kidney failure. In October, just before his death, Dove wrote to Phillips for the last time:\n\n\"You have no idea what sending on those checks to me at this time. After fighting for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed a great deal of time this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.\"\n\nArthur Dove's granddaughter is the interactive artist Toni Dove.\n\nThe Estate of Arthur Dove is represented by the Terry Dintenfass Gallery.\n\nIn 2017, it was announced that Geneva, New York would receive economic revitalization funding that would, in part, assist with rehabilitating the 1878 Dove Block building, once Dove's studio in the 1930s. The Landmark Society of Western New York had previously announced that the historic Dove Block building was on its \"Five to Revive for 2016.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

The FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2007–2011 categorized it as a relief airport.\n\nIt is used for general aviation as an alternative to Los Angeles International Airport, about west.\n\nColonel C. S. Smith landed in an open field near the town of Compton in June 1924. Colonel Smith felt the field, owned by the local school board, would make an ideal airport location and negotiated for the airport's founding. Between 1924 and 1936 the airport and its land passed through several hands until Earl Woodley took over the lease in 1936. He purchased land for a crosswind runway. During the war years of 1941 to 1946, civilian flying was restricted and the airport was used by the military as a truck depot. After the war, Mr Woodley resumed operations and eventually became owner of the land. When Mr Woodley died in 1962, the airport was threatened with closure when it was purchased by an investment company. Pilot groups, citizens, the mayor of Compton, and the entire Compton City Council encouraged the Board of Supervisors to condemn the land and allow the county to purchase it. In June 1966 the entire airport property of 77 acres was purchased for $2,948,883.\n\nCompton/Woodley Airport covers and has two asphalt runways (7L/25R and 7R/25L), each 3,322 x 60 ft (1,013 x 18 m).

He served as the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel and the Rishon LeZion from 2003 to 2013. His opposite number in those years was Rabbi Yona Metzger, who then served as Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel.\n\nShlomo Amar was born in Casablanca, Morocco, and immigrated to Israel in 1962 at age 14. He was a close associate of the spiritual leader of the Shas party and former Sephardi Chief Rabbi, Ovadia Yosef. Before his appointment as co-Chief Rabbi of Israel, Amar had served as the head of the Petah Tikva Rabbinical Court. He was elected chief rabbi of Tel Aviv in 2002, the first sole Chief Rabbi of the city.\n\nAs the former Rishon LeZion, Amar served as the spiritual leader of the Sephardic community in the Land of Israel. Jews from around the world continue to look to him as a leader.\n\nIn October 2014, after Jerusalem had gone 11 years without a chief rabbi, Amar was elected as the city's Sephardic Chief Rabbi, alongside Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Aryeh Stern. Amar had the support of Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat and Bayit Yehudi chairman Naftali Bennett.\n\nIn 2004, Rav Amar traveled to Portugal to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the Lisbon synagogue Shaare Tikvah. During his stay, Amar met descendants of Jewish families persecuted by the Inquisition who still practice Judaism (Bnei Anusim) at the house of Rabbi Boaz Pash. This was an historical meeting that had not happened between a Chief Rabbi and Portuguese Marranos (Bnei Anusim) in centuries. Amar promised to create a committee to evaluate the halakhic status of the community. Due to the delay of the committee to do any work a second community in Lisbon, Comunidade Judaica Masorti Beit Israel, was later established to ensure the recognition of the Bnei Anusim as Jews.\n\nIn 2002, Rav Amar was sent by then-Interior Minister Eli Yishai to Ethiopia to meet with the Falash Mura community, a group of Ethiopian Jews whose ancestors converted to Christianity. He subsequently recommended that they undergo a conventional conversion to Judaism, which provoked an angry reaction. Later, in 2003, as Chief Rabbi, he reversed himself, saying that anyone related to a member of Beta Israel through matrilineal descent qualified as Jewish and should be brought to Israel by the government (and then undergo a formal conversion ceremony after a period of study). In January 2004, following the recommendations of the Knesset and the Chief Rabbis, Ariel Sharon announced a plan (still largely unimplemented) to bring all of the Falash Mura (presently close to 18,000) to Israel by the end of 2007.\n\nRav Amar made news in September 2005 when he told a Shinui MK that he was willing to support civil marriages for non-Jews and people who are unaffiliated with a religion. Amar pointed out the difference between his idea and that of his predecessor, Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron, who had proposed civil marriage for anyone interested in 2004. Amar's plan, by comparison, would only apply to the marriage of non-Jews with each other. Amar stated that his suggestion was designed to solve the problem of Israel's 300,000 religionless, non-Jewish immigrants, many from the former Soviet Union who claim Jewish identity and citizenship, but whose Jewish status may not be accepted by Orthodox standards and the Chief Rabbinate. Amar called on representatives of the non-Jewish immigrants to discuss the matter with representatives of the rabbinate.\n\nIn an Arabic-written letter to the Muslim scholar Sheikh Yusuf Qaradawi, Sephardic Chief Rabbi Amar criticized Benedict XVI's remarks on Islam, writing: \"Our way is to honour every religion and every nation according to their paths, as it is written in the book of prophets: 'Because every nation will go in the name of its Lord.'\" He later told Benedict that it was his duty to spread the message that the Jewish people belong in the Land of Israel.\n\nIn April 2015, Rabbi Shlomo Amar, expressed his \"stomach churning\" in light of Rabbi Shlomo Riskin's Day to Praise joint interfaith Hallel praise initiative of Jews and Christians in a synagogue in Jerusalem.\n\nIn December 2019, he visited Bahrain for interfaith event, where he met the King, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, and religious leaders from Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Russia, the United States, Italy, India, and Thailand.\n\nIn November 2006, Amar submitted a draft bill to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that would remove the conversion clause from the Israeli Law of Return. This would prevent converts from all streams of Judaism, including Orthodox Judaism, from having automatic citizenship rights in Israel, and restrict the Law of Return to applying only to Jews by birth whose mothers were Jewish. This also affects potential immigrants who are descended from only one Jewish parent or grandparent, not all of whom would be accepted as Jewish under Orthodox law. \"See also:\" Matrilineal descent and Who is a Jew?\n\nAmar said in interviews that the bill was designed to prevent \"a situation where there are two peoples in the State of Israel\". Amar said the Law of Return's inclusion of converts had turned the conversion process into a political, rather than religious, exercise, and that many people were converting for immigration purposes, not out of sincere religiosity. Amar suggested that an alternative could be that converts, upon arriving in Israel, went through a naturalization process via the Citizenship Law. The bill also gives rabbinic courts and the Chief Rabbinate sole authority over conversions.\n\nAmar said that the bill was partially written in response to the Israeli Supreme Court deliberating a dozen petitions by the Israeli Reform movement to allow Reform converts to stay in Israel. Jews converted under Reform or Conservative auspices abroad have been accepted under the Law of Return since 1989, but the 2006 case deals with conversions that occurred in Israel. Amar argued that if the Reform converts were permitted to stay in the country, they would eventually become frustrated with their inability to marry Jews (as the Chief Rabbinate would not recognize their conversions as valid), and this would lead to them marrying non-Jews, which would polarize the state.\n\nAmar received some criticism from the Reform and Conservative movements in Israel and America, and various Israeli politicians and government figures, including Menachem Mazuz, Yossi Beilin, and UTJ MK Avraham Ravitz, who said he did not believe Amar's bill, if passed, would stop Reform or Conservative converts from receiving citizenship, which would lead back to the initial problem of \"two peoples\" in Israel. He added that Amar's proposed bill would constitute blatant discrimination against converts. Other commentators noted that the citizenship process for non-Jews can be long and arduous, and pointed out that there are presently many naturalized Israelis, particularly immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who do not meet the halakhic definition of a Jew. One report, challenging Amar's claim that his bill was meant as a preventative measure, wrote, \"The 'division of the Jewish people in Israel' is a present reality, not a future possibility.\"\n\nHowever, some in Israel's legal community supported separating religious conversion from the secular citizenship process. Amar also received support from several religious politicians such as NRP MK Zevulun Orlev, who said the bill would protect Jewish unity.\n\nPoliticians and gay rights activists have called for the resignation of Amar after his comments on homosexuality in an interview with Israel Hayom newspaper, where he stated that homosexuality was a \"cult of abomination\", which the Torah \"punishes ... with death\".\n"}

Dawson Matheson and his wife Gertrude (née McCuaig). H17417 Matheson underwent training at the Royal Military College of Canada in 1936.\nMatheson graduated from Queen's University in 1940, winning the prestigious Tricolour Award in that year for distinguished achievement.\n\nMatheson served as an officer with the 1st Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, 1st Canadian Infantry Division in Italy during World War II where he was wounded.\n\nHe held honorary militia appointments with the 30th Field Artillery Regiment, Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery from 1972 to 1982. He later retired with the rank of Colonel.\n\nAfter the war, Matheson met Edith Bickley, a radiologist's assistant, in St. Anne de Bellevue Hospital in Montreal, Quebec. He said they would never have met if she hadn’t been such a curious nurse. The couple married and eventually had six children. He received a Bachelor of Laws degree from Osgoode Hall Law School, a Master of Arts degree from Mount Allison University, and a Master of Laws degree from the University of Western Ontario. He was called to the Bar of Ontario in 1948 and was created a Queen's Counsel in 1967. He practiced law with the firm of Matheson, Henderson & Hart in Brockville, Ontario. A member of the United Church of Canada, Matheson resided in Kingston, Ontario until his death in December 2013.\n\nHe was first elected as a Liberal in the Ontario riding of Leeds in a by-election in 1961. He was re-elected in 1962, 1963, and 1965. He was defeated by 4 votes in 1968.\n\nMatheson was a leading member of the multi-party parliamentary committee whose mandate was to select a new flag design. It was Dr. George F.G. Stanley's idea that the new flag should be red and white, and that it should feature the single maple leaf. Matheson wrote a book, \"Canada's Flag: A Search for a Country\", about the creation of the new flag. (This book began as Matheson's master's thesis, supervised by Dr. George Stanley at Mount Allison University.) \"Near this Parade Square, in March 1964, while viewing the College Flag atop Mackenzie Building, Col the Hon. G.F.G Stanley, then Dean of Arts RMC, first suggested to Col. the Hon. J.R. Matheson, then MP for Leeds, that the RMC College Flag should form the basis of the National Flag. The two collaborated on a design which was ultimately approved by Parliament and by Royal Proclamation adopted as the National Flag of Canada as of the 15th of February 1965.\"\n\nMatheson also played an important role in the creation of the Order of Canada, which was designed by Bruce W. Beatty.\n\nIn 1968, he was appointed a judge of the Judicial District of Ottawa-Carleton. In 1984, he was appointed a judge of the County Court of Lanark. In 1985, he was appointed a judge of the District Court of Ontario. From 1990 to 1992, he was a justice of the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division).\n\nMatheson was portrayed by Peter MacNeill in a Heritage Minute television commercial about his involvement in the Flag committee.\n\n\nA small, local committee in Brockville, Ontario, is claiming that Brockville is \"the birthplace of the Canadian Flag\" and John Matheson \"the father of the flag\". Both claims are erroneous, and inspired by an effort to boost tourism dollars; the City of Brockville has since taken down its \"birthplace\" signs. Dr. George Stanley, Dean of Arts at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario, proposed the design for the flag, and the Great Canadian Flag Debate, which led to the adoption of the flag, took place in Ottawa. Matheson himself concluded that Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson was the real \"father\" of the Canadian flag.\nMatheson received the Honorary degree of Doctor of Military Science from the Royal Military College of Canada on 14 May 1993.\n\nThe John Matheson Sword is awarded annually to the Preparatory Year cadet at the Royal Military College Saint-Jean who achieved the highest results in all four components of the College’s program, namely Academics, Leadership, Athletics and Bilingualism.\n\n"}

{"id": "2055918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055918", "title": "Yona Metzger", "text": "Yona Metzger\n\nYona Metzger (; born 4 August 1953) is an Israeli Orthodox rabbi and the former Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel. In 2013, while chief rabbi, a fraud investigation was opened. Metzger later pleaded guilty to a number of corruption charges, was tried and convicted, and after a plea bargain was rejected, served prison time.\n\nMetzger was born in Haifa in 1953. He served in the Israel Defense Forces as a chaplain in the 7th Armored Brigade, and was discharged with the rank of captain. Metzger received his ordination from the Yeshivat Kerem BeYavne hesder yeshiva before working as a religious teacher. He served as rabbi of the Tiferet Zvi Synagogue in Tel Aviv, and was later appointed regional rabbi of northern Tel Aviv. Metzger has written ten books, two of which were awarded prizes by the President of Israel.\n\nWhile Metzger is from a national religious family and educational background, he had been closely identified with Haredi Judaism, and often sought the advice of Degel HaTorah's late spiritual leader Yosef Shalom Eliashiv. Some observers claimed that this made Metzger an excellent candidate to represent both communities, with one reporter calling him \"undoubtedly the most moderate and most Zionist candidate\". His supporters have often compared him to his immediate predecessor, Yisrael Meir Lau, who was seen as having a foot in every camp, which helped him in dealing with different kinds of Jews, particularly secular ones.\n\nMetzger was elected Chief Rabbi of Israel in April 2003. At 50, he was the youngest Chief Rabbi in Israel's history, until his successor, David Lau, who was elected at the age of 47 in 2013.\n\nWhile Chief Rabbi, Metzger was active in attempting to reach out to diverse groups of people, both Jews and non-Jews. He attempted to facilitate the maintaining of kashrut standards in Israel by employing technology, for instance, by activating steam pumps via cell phone for cooking meat in order to avoid issues of \"bishul akum\" (the cooking of food by a non-Jew). Metzger was also involved in strengthening ties between Israeli and Diaspora standards of kashrut in order to make them more standardized and consistent.\n\nMetzger was a prominent in keeping up interest in the cases of several \"lost Israelis\", notably Jonathan Pollard and Ron Arad. He repeatedly brought up Arad in the course of official meetings with various Muslim dignitaries. He was also involved in keeping up the pressure on both the Israeli and various Arab governments to protect the safety and negotiate the release of various Israeli prisoners taken captive by Hezbollah.\n\nIn 2004, Metzger announced an initiative to insert a special prayer for Jonathan Pollard into the daily prayer service. The prayer was written by Metzger, and is written in the style of a \"Mishaberach prayer\" intended for people in dire straits. Many Orthodox synagogues announced the adoption of the prayer into their liturgy.\n\nMetzger worked to encourage friendly relationships with other religious communities. One idea that Metzger proposed was the establishment of a religious United Nations in Jerusalem. He first advocated this in late 2004 after mediating a highly publicized dispute between Jerusalem Haredim and the Armenian Christian community. Under Metzger's plan, the new body would contain representatives of the world's religions, as opposed to nations. Metzger has also suggested that the Dalai Lama could lead the assembly. The Dalai Lama was reportedly very excited at the idea, and pledged to help Metzger realize his plan. Other supporters include Frederico Major, the co-president of the Alliance for Civilizations, a Spanish lobby group for international conflict resolution.\n\nOn a February 2007 trip to India, Metzger joined other prominent rabbis in signing a declaration against violence with local Hindu leaders, as part of a summit organized by the World Council of Religious Leaders. One of the points emphasized by the participants was the commonality between Jews and Hindus, particularly in regards to ongoing violence at the hands of Muslims. Metzger noted in his remarks, \"Jews have lived in India for 2,000 years, and have never been discriminated against. This is something unparalleled in human history.\"\n\nIn March 2008, Metzger supported an interfaith conference proposed by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.\n\nDuring the \"bus conflict\" about mixed seating between men and women, Metzger stated that this is not a \"Haredi country\", and urged the ultra-Orthodox to not push their opinions on the others and be more accepting.\n\nDuring his term, Metzger was involved in several notable incidents of rapprochement with the global and Israeli-Armenian communities.\n\nIn December 2004, Metzger was instrumental in easing tensions between Jerusalem's Haredim and Armenian Christians following an incident in which a Haredi yeshiva student spat on an Armenian archbishop. Metzger gained further attention in November 2005, during a visit to the Memorial of Armenian Genocide and Genocide Museum in Yerevan. He laid a wreath, and gave a short speech in which he acknowledged the pain of the Armenian people and emphasized that though Israel does not formally recognize the Armenian Genocide as a genocide, he does \"use that term\". Metzger went on to say, \"No other nation can understand the pain of the Armenians better than Jews.\" Metzger's comments received a very positive reaction in Armenia, particularly at the implication that more Israelis are changing their positions on using the word \"genocide\" to refer to the Armenians.\n\nTurkey's Jews, on the other hand, themselves a vulnerable minority population, reacted with some discomfort at Metzger putting them in an awkward situation. The spokesman for Turkey's Chief Rabbi commented, \"Let the historians do their job, and then we will see.\"\n\nMetzger's appointment was controversial because he was not a halachic authority. Metzger had never served as a religious judge (dayan), though his role as Chief Rabbi required him to sit as President of the Rabbinical Supreme Court for five years, before switching with his Sephardic counterpart to be head of the Chief Rabbinate Council.\n\nIn February 2005, the Israeli police began a formal criminal investigation of Metzger regarding allegations of fraud and bribery related to benefits he received from a Jerusalem hotel. Metzger was questioned twice, and denied any wrongdoing, but suspended himself from the Rabbinical High Court in June 2005, while waiting to see whether or not the Israeli Attorney General, Menachem Mazuz, decided to indict him. No charges were brought, and Metzger and his supporters dismissed all of the accusations against him as part of an ongoing smear campaign against him.\n\nOn 3 April 2006, Attorney General Mazuz announced that he was closing the Metzger investigation, and would not seek an indictment, citing a lack of sufficient evidence. However, he added that in light of various \"disturbing\" information that came to light during the investigation, including contradictory statements given to the police, that the Chief Rabbi should resign. Mazuz also called on the Justice Ministry to consider bringing Metzger's case \"before the Dayanim Selection Committee ... to consider ending his term in office\" if Metzger did not resign.\n\nThe rabbi's supporters included some of Israel's most notable religious figures: Metzger met with a group of high-profile rabbis, including his political patron, leading Lithuanian rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, as well as former Chief Rabbis Ovadia Yosef, Mordechai Eliyahu, and Avraham Shapira. The rabbis praised his character and integrity, heavily criticized Mazuz's behavior, and promised to help Metzger fight the public cries for his resignation. Rabbi Shapira reportedly told Metzger that he was being \"watched over\" by a \"special angel in heaven\", and Rabbi Eliyahu commented that in his judgement, Metzger was \"pure and clear as snow\".\n\nMetzger said that the ruling had been issued \"without giving me the opportunity to defend myself. This was a violation of the basic rights enjoyed by every individual.\" Shortly after Mazuz's comments, the rabbi's spokespeople declared that he had no intention of resigning, and criticized Mazuz for convicting Metzger in the public square by tarnishing his reputation. Some in the Israeli media castigated Mazuz for overstepping his role as Attorney General.\n\nMetzger filed a petition with the Supreme Court of Israel to protest Mazuz's public declaration, alleging that his image had been destroyed without a chance to tell his side of the story, and accusing Mazuz of engaging in \"child-like\" tactics. Metzger's lawyer charged that Mazuz's report on Metzger contained unverifiable information, and that it constituted a personal attack on the rabbi without giving him the benefit of a defense or hearing. The petition requested that the second half of Mazuz's 30-page report, in which he harshly attacked Metzger's conduct and recommended his removal, be stricken from the record.\n\nIn late May 2006, the new Justice Minister, Chaim Ramon, told reporters that he intended to follow up on Mazuz's recommendation and attempt to force Metzger's resignation. It was also reported that outgoing Chief Justice Aharon Barak had attempted to mediate between the parties, proposing a compromise in which all of Mazuz's report would stay in, but that Mazuz would sign a statement retracting his personal criticism of Metzger's character and declaring, \"There is nothing which obliges the Minister of Justice to take administrative measures against Metzger\", in effect leaving further action to the discretion of the incoming Justice Minister. Metzger's lawyer refused the deal, saying that the damage to Metzger's reputation from the report was too important to be left in as part of a compromise.\n\nIn March 2007, Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch recommended that Mazuz re-write the report and remove the allegations she called \"gossip and rumors\".\n\nIn February 2008, after an investigation prompted by Mazuz's report and a recommendation by Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann that Metzger be impeached, the Justice Ministry appointments committee authorized the end of Metzger's suspension, permitting him to return to his position on the Supreme Rabbinical Court. However, in late March, the Knesset Interior Affairs and Environment Committee ratified an amendment to the Chief Rabbinate Law that effectively prohibited Metzger from trading positions with Shlomo Amar, as is standard practice halfway through their ten-year terms. The author of the amendment claimed that it was not directed against Metzger, arguing that it, in fact, would allow for future \"flexibility\", permitting Chief Rabbis lacking training as rabbinical judges, as Metzger does, to \"forgo\" becoming President of the rabbinical courts. Some Metzger critics, however, argued that the law was relevant only to Metzger because he is the first-ever Chief Rabbi to be elected to the position who has no experience as a rabbinical judge.\n\nWhen Mazuz asked Metzger to resign in 2005, the story initially sparked some debate over the necessity of having two Israeli Chief Rabbis at all, or of maintaining the Chief Rabbinate as an institution. Some suggested that one way of preserving the integrity and relevance of the office might be to convince the religious Ashkenazi communities of Israel to decline to hold elections to replace Metzger, should he resign. This move would have consolidated the post from two seats to one, and help eliminate one of the most public representations of the office's perceived anachronism often cited by its critics. However, since then there has been little follow-up.\n\nOn 12 December 2011, the Israeli daily \"Israel Hayom\" reported that Metzger had received an offer to serve as Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the end of Chief Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks term of office in 2013.\n\nMetzger gave an interview with the British Jewish News paper in January 2008 in which he advocated transferring the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to the Sinai Peninsula, adding that though Israel welcomed peaceful Muslims, the world's Muslims needed to recognize that Jerusalem belongs to the Jewish people, saying, \"You have another place, Mecca and Medina, you don't need a third place.\" Metzger also challenged the idea that Muslims had any connection to Jerusalem at all, noting that when Muslims pray to Mecca, their backs face Jerusalem. Metzger received some criticism from moderate Israelis for these remarks, as well as by some in the Arab world.\n\nIn June 2013, Lahav 433's National Fraud Investigations Unit raided Metzger's home and office on new suspicions of bribery, fraud, and money laundering. He was suspected of pocketing hundreds of thousands of shekels in gifts from donors destined for non-governmental organizations. On behalf of Metzger, his attorneys denied all allegations.\n\nMetzger was arrested on November 18, 2013, after the investigation, and \"charged with bribery, money laundering, and income tax violations\". In February 2015, Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein indicted Metzger for accepting bribes, attempting to silence witnesses, and interfering with the investigation about his dealings.\n\nOn January 24, 2017, Metzger agreed to a plea bargain in which he admitted he was guilty of bribery, tax fraud, and interfering in the trial process. In exchange, he would receive a prison sentence of three-and-a-half years and pay 5 million shekels ($1.3 million), including his tax debt and a fine. However, a month later, on February 23, the Jerusalem District Court threw out the plea bargain, and sentenced Metzger to four-and-a-half years in prison.\n\n\n"}

Slunj has a population of 1,674, with a total of 5,076 people in the municipality (2011) and is the cultural and social center of the region of Kordun in the vicinity to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Administratively, the town is part of Karlovac County. Slunj is underdeveloped municipality which is statistically classified as the First Category Area of Special State Concern by the Government of Croatia.\n\nAn old fortification of the Frankopans, built during the wars against the Turks, \"Slovin\" was first mentioned in the 12th century. The old fort was property of the Frankopan (Hungarian \"Frangapán\") family since the 15th century, joined by an old Franciscan monastery from the same period. Later, this town has been called Slunj. In the 16th century the town was ravaged by the Ottoman wars and turned into a military outpost of the Croatian Military Frontier, but by the end of the 17th century the settlement was rebuilt into the Slunj as it exists today. The castle has been developed to a fortress and served as headquarters for the commanding general of this area (see Stari grad Slunj). After the Treaty of Sistova in 1791 people increasingly began to re-settle in this area.\n\nDuring the short French governance period from 1809 until 1813, Slunj encountered an economic boom as streets, storage facilities and mills were built and as vineyards and mulberry trees were planted. At this point of time, the Croatian language has become official language of the country. The residence of the former governor general of the French Illyrian Provinces, marshal Auguste de Marmont, still exists.\n\nThe town of Slunj was first mentioned in a written document by the chronicler Johann Weikhard von Valvasor who reported about the fortified town of Slunj, a bridge and a mill in 1689. The first illustration of the mills of Rastoke dates back from 1789. It was a copper engraving that has been added to a description by Belsazar Hacquet. At the end of the 19th century, Stjepan Širola wrote the following about this place: \"\"The surroundings of Slunj are downright romantic […]. They are crowned by the magnificent waterfalls of the Slunjčica river by which even not outspoken nature lovers will be captivated. Indeed, Slunj with its romantic surroundings and the silver waterfalls of the Slunjčica represent a true nature gem astonishing even to foreigners.\"\"\n\nUntil 1918, Slunj (named \"SZLUIN\") was part of the Austrian monarchy (Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Modruš-Rijeka County, after the compromise of 1867), in the Croatian Military Frontier. It was administered by the \"SZLUINER Grenz-Infanterie-Regiment N°IV\" before 1881. Slunj became a district capital in the Modruš-Rijeka County in the Kingdom.\n\nThe Cazin uprising of 1950, an armed anti-state rebellion of peasants, which mostly affected the Bosnian towns Cazin and Velika Kladuša, also affected Slunj to a lesser extent. All of the cities were a part of Communist Yugoslavia at the time. Peasants revolted against the forced collectivization and collective farms by the Yugoslav government on the farmers of its country. Following a drought in 1949, the peasants of Yugoslavia were unable to meet unrealistic quotas set by their government and were punished. The revolt that followed the drought resulted in the killings and persecution of those who organized the uprising, but also many innocent civilians. It was the only peasant rebellion in the history of Cold War Europe.\nIn 1963, the Austrian writer Heimito von Doderer published the novel \"The Waterfalls of Slunj\" () which features a climactic sequence set in this locality. During the 20th century scientific research studies were carried out in the Slunj area and particularly its Rastoke district. During the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century Rastoke has been the center of social life in this region. With the development of the electric mill and massive emigration after the Second World War the economic significance of the mills in Rastoke has declined drastically.\n\nSlunj is famous for its little waterfalls and the well-preserved corn mills (dating back to the 18th century) in the picturesque lower part of the town, called Rastoke (referring to the branching of the rivers). At Slunj, the Slunjčica river (also called “Slušnica“ by local people) flows over several waterfalls and cascades into the Korana river. Here is also the location of the 22 water mills of Rastoke.\n\nAs of 2011, most of Slunj's population is Croatian (87.9%) followed by Serbs (10.5%) and a small number of other ethnic groups.\n\nThe settlements in the Town of Slunj is:\n\nAlthough Slunj is very small, it has many sport clubs. Most famous are the football club NK Slunj and MNK Drenak. There are two football fields in Slunj. One is situated in the center of Slunj and popularly called \"Gradsko igralište\" (Town field) and the other is Zubac, which is the official turf of NK Slunj.\n\nOn the last day of \"\"Dani grada Slunja\"\" (festivity called \"Days of the city of Slunj\"), which usually takes place at the beginning of August, games are organized on main swimming area on the river Korana. Participating teams compete in many games like swimming and snorkeling and many other.\n\n\n\n\n"}

First held in 1993, and now organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), in conjunction with \"Vélo Magazine\", it takes place each July, normally on a Tour rest day.\n\nL'Étape du Tour is normally held over mountain roads in either the Pyrenees or French Alps, up climbs such as the Col du Galibier, Col d'Aubisque, Mont Ventoux or the Col du Tourmalet. Around 15,000 riders participate - many travelling from other countries to compete - and the event takes place on roads closed by the police to other traffic, with refreshment stops and medical support provided along the route.\n\nInternational versions of L'Étape are held annually in various countries around the world to give local riders a Tour-like experience.

Rain meant the sights of the Pyrenees couldn't be seen.\n\n\nGreg LeMond rode this Etape along with his son, after being inspired by his son riding it previously. LeMond said \"I had the time of my life\", despite getting \"650th place\" and being \"impressed that I even finished\". \"I decided that day that nobody's going to keep me from cycling, not Trek, not Armstrong, not Verbuggen, not anybody.\". \n\nBritish comedian Hugh Dennis also rode this Etape.\n\nIn 2008, the 167 km stage 10 from Pau to Hautacam, including a passage over the 2114 m./6935 ft. Col du Tourmalet was selected for L'Étape du Tour with Laurent Four coming home in the fastest time of 5 hours 38 minutes. Unfortunately, the weather on the day was very poor and visibility at the summit of the Tourmalet was down to 10m.\n\nThe 2009 edition started in Montélimar (Drôme) and covered 172 km and four smaller climbs (côte de Citelle, col d'Ey, col de Fontaube, col de Notre-Dame des Abeilles) before finishing at the summit of Mont Ventoux.\n\nThe 2010 event started in Pau and finished at the Col du Tourmalet on 18 July 2010. Nearly 7000 cyclists completed the event, thanks to weather far better than the pros had several days later.\n\nFor 2011, ASO organised two \"Etapes\". The first, on 11 July, on the Modane - Alpe d'Huez stage covering 109 km, was the shortest in history. This is the same stage the pros rode in Stage 19 on 22 July. The second Etape for 2011, on 17 July, was actually the longest in history, covering 208 km, from Issoire to Saint Flour in the massif central (south of Clermont Ferrand). The pros rode this stage on 10 July in Stage 9 of the 2011 TdF.\n\nIn 2012 there were two events. The first event was from Albertville to La Toussuire on 8 July, following the 140 km route of stage 11 of the Tour de France and including the Col de la Madeleine and the Col de la Croix de Fer, finishing at La Toussuire, part of the Les Sybelles ski area. The second event held on 14 July followed the route of stage 16 from Pau to Bagnères-de-Luchon, crossing the Col d'Aubisque, Col du Tourmalet, Col d'Aspin, and Col de Peyresourde for a total distance of 197 km. Only about 60% of entrants finished either event within the official cut-off times.\n\nASO have reverted to a single event for 2013 partly because the 2012 event lost money due to logistics associated with deploying buses and trucks to recover riders who were unable to finish. On 7 July, the Etape recreated stage 20 of the 2013 Tour de France, starting in the town of Annecy and finishing at the ski station of Annecy-Semnoz at an altitude of 1,655m. The 130 km route included the climb of the 1,142m des Prés and the 1,463m Mont Revard.\n\nThe 2014 event on 20 July 2014 followed a similar route to the 2008 event, beginning in Pau and finishing at Hautacam.\n\nThe 2015 route began in the Savoie town of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, and covered a 140 km course, climbing the Col de Chaussy, Col de la Croix de Fer, Col du Mollard, with a summit finish at La Toussuire.\n\nIn 2016, the event began in Megève and ended in Morzine in the Haute Savoie. The race was shortened to 122 km and three mountain passes after Col de la Ramaz had to be skipped due to rockfall danger on the descent. 11,471 participants set off from Megève to climb the 1,487m Col des Aravis, the 1,618m Col de la Colombière and the 1,691m Col de Joux-Plane. A record 11,212 finishers reached Megève. The winner was Tao Quemere in 3h33'35\" and the first woman was Edwige Pitel in 3h56'37\".\n\nThe 2017 event, held on 16 July, followed a nearly identical route to what was used four days later for Stage 18 of the 2017 Tour de France. Both L'Étape and the Tour's Stage 18 started in Briançon and ended atop the 2,360m Col d'Izoard, with L'Étape listed as 181 km and Stage 18 as 179.5 km.\n\n"}

This includes the institutions, instruments, people, rules, procedures, standards, and technologies that make its exchange possible. A common type of payment system is called an operational network that links bank accounts and provides for monetary exchange using bank deposits. Some payment systems also include credit mechanisms, which are essentially a different aspect of payment.\n\nPayment systems are used in lieu of tendering cash in domestic and international transactions. This consists of a major service provided by banks and other financial institutions. Traditional payment systems include negotiable instruments such as drafts (e.g., cheques) and documentary credits such as letters of credit. With the advent of computers and electronic communications, many alternative electronic payment systems have emerged. The term electronic payment refers to a payment made from one bank account to another using electronic methods and forgoing the direct intervention of bank employees. Narrowly defined electronic payment refers to e-commerce—a payment for buying and selling goods or services offered through the Internet, or broadly to any type of electronic funds transfer. \n\nModern payment systems use cash-substitutes as compared to traditional payment systems. This includes debit cards, credit cards, electronic funds transfers, direct credits, direct debits, internet banking and e-commerce payment systems. \n\nPayment systems may be physical or electronic and each has its own procedures and protocols. Standardization has allowed some of these systems and networks to grow to a global scale, but there are still many country-specific and product-specific systems. Examples of payment systems that have become globally available are credit card and automated teller machine networks. Other specific forms of payment systems are also used to settle financial transactions for products in the equity markets, bond markets, currency markets, futures markets, derivatives markets, options markets. Additionally. forms exist to transfer funds between financial institutions. Domestically this is accomplished by using Automated clearing house and real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems. Internationally this is accomplished using the SWIFT network.\n\nAn efficient national payment system reduces the cost of exchanging goods, services, and assets. It is indispensable to the functioning of the interbank, money, and capital markets. A weak payment system may severely drag on the stability and developmental capacity of a national economy. Such failures can result in inefficient use of financial resources, inequitable risk-sharing among agents, actual losses for participants, and loss of confidence in the financial system and in the very use of money. The technical efficiency of the payment system is important for the development of the economy.\n\nAn Automated clearing house (ACH) system processes transactions in batches, storing and transmitting them in groups. An ACH is considered a net settlement system, which means settlement may be delayed. This poses what is known as settlement risk. \n\nReal-time gross settlement systems (RTGS) are funds transfer systems where transfer of money or securities takes place from one bank to another on a \"real-time\" and on \"gross\" basis. Settlement in \"real time\" means that payment transaction does not require any waiting period. The transactions are settled as soon as they are processed. \"Gross settlement\" means the transaction is settled on one to one basis without bunching or netting with any other transaction. Once processed, payments are final and irrevocable.\n\nComparatively, ACHs are typically used for low-value, non-urgent transactions while RTGS systems are typically used for high-value, urgent transactions.\n\nGlobalization is driving corporations to transact more frequently across borders. Consumers are also transacting more on a global basis—buying from foreign eCommerce sites as well as traveling, living, and working abroad. For the payments industry, the result is higher volumes of payments—in terms of both currency value and number of transactions. This is also leading to a consequent shift downwards in the average value of these payments.\n\nThe ways these payments are made can be cumbersome, error prone, and expensive. Growth, after all, is often messy. Payments systems set up decades ago continue to be used sometimes retrofitted, sometimes force-fitted—to meet the needs of modern corporations. And, frequently, the systems creak and groan as they bear the strain. As an example of such systems includes, STEP2 (an upgrade from 2003) processes only Euros and TARGET2 (an upgrade from 2007) is closed on Saturdays and Sundays and some public holidays.\n\nAs of 2014, STEP2 is the only Pan-European automated clearing house (or PE-ACH system) in operation. This type of system is thought to become less relevant as banks will settle their transactions via multiple clearing houses rather than using one central clearing house.\n\nTARGET2 (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System) is a RTGS system that covers the European Union member states which use the euro. It is part of the Eurosystem, which comprises the European Central Bank and the national central banks of those countries that have adopted the euro. TARGET2 is used for the settlement of central bank operations, large-value Euro interbank transfers as well as other euro payments. TARGET 2 provides real-time financial transfers, debt settlement at central banks which is immediate and irreversible.\n\nFor users of these systems, on both the paying and receiving sides, it can be difficult and time-consuming to learn how to use cross-border payments tools, and how to set up processes to make optimal use of them. Solution providers (both banks and non-banks) also face challenges, struggling to cobble together old systems to meet new demands. But for these providers, cross-border payments are both lucrative (especially given foreign exchange conversion revenue) and rewarding, in terms of the overall financial relationship created with the end customer.\n\nThe challenges for global payments are not simply those resulting from volume increases. A number of economic, political, and technical factors are changing the types of cross-border transactions conducted. Such factors include:\n\n"}

It was initially developed and implemented in the city of Karlsruhe, Germany by the local transit authority, \"Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund\" (KVV).\n\nCommencing service in 1992, the system in Karlsruhe has provided a connection between the regular railway network and the city's local tram network. The whole system is now called the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. Passengers may travel from distant towns such as Baden-Baden directly into the city centre of Karlsruhe, bridging the inconvenient distance between the main station and the city centre. For most trips, the number of train transfers has been reduced significantly.\n\nThis model has led to the creation of similar tram-train systems in other locations.\n\nA similar model has been connecting the city of Vienna with the Baden suburb since 1886 as Lokalbahn Wien-Baden. Other systems that have implemented the Karlsruhe model include:\n\nIn 2013 Adelaide Metro in Australia proposed the PortLINK project, which would have featured the Karlsruhe model for 4.8 km of track between Bowden and Woodville, followed by another 4.2 km to Port Adelaide.\n\nZwickau, Germany has reversed the Karlsruhe model by extending Lightweight RegioSprinter diesel trains from the main-line railway onto the street tramway as train-trams (Zwickau Model).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2055941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055941", "title": "Elevator paradox (physics)", "text": "Elevator paradox (physics)\n\nThe elevator paradox relates to a hydrometer placed on an \"elevator\" or vertical conveyor that, by moving to different elevations, changes the atmospheric pressure. In this classic demonstration, the floating hydrometer remains at an equilibrium position. Essentially, a hydrometer measures specific gravity of liquids independent of barometric pressure. This is because the change in air pressure is applied to the entire hydrometer flask. The submerged portion of the flask receives a transmitted force through the liquid, thus no portion of the apparatus receives a net force resulting from a change in air pressure.\n\nThis is a paradox if the buoyancy of the hydrometer is said to depend on the weight of the liquid that it displaces. At a higher barometric pressure, the liquid occupies a slightly smaller volume, and thus more dense might be considered to have a higher specific gravity. However, the hydrometer also displaces air, and the weight of the liquid and the air are affected equally by elevation.\n\nA Cartesian diver, on the other hand, has an internal space that, unlike a hydrometer, is not rigid, and thus can change its displacement as increasing external air pressure compresses the air in the diver. If the diver, instead of being placed in the classic plastic bottle, were floated in a flask on an elevator, the diver would respond to a change in air pressure. Similarly, a non-rigid container like a toy balloon will be affected, as will the rib cage of a human SCUBA diver, and such systems will vary in buoyancy. A glass hydrometer is rigid under normal pressure, for all practical purposes.\n\nThe upward or downward acceleration of the elevator, as long as the net force is directed downward, will not change the equilibrium point of the hydrometer either. The force due to acceleration acts on the hydrometer exactly as it would on an equal mass of water or other liquid.\n"}

Astal was released early in the Sega Saturn's life and used hand-drawn graphics. The animations for the cutscenes were provided by TMS Entertainment.\n\nThe player controls Astal through a side-scrolling world. Astal's primary mode of attacking is using the B Button on the Gamepad. Pressed without direction, or with left or right held down, Astal will grab and throw enemies or objects over his shoulder. Pressed while holding down, Astal will punch the ground, stunning enemies. Pressed while jumping (via using the C button), he will punch down with both fists. The B Button is also used to lift certain pieces of scenery, such as trees or boulders, and throw them. Astal's final method of attack is blowing. Pressing up on the D-pad will allow him to inhale air, and holding forward and pressing B immediately after will blow this air out, literally blowing away all enemies directly in front of him.\n\nWithin each level are a number of glowing enemies. Defeating them charges a meter in Astal's HUD located at the bottom of the screen. When A, X, Y or Z is pressed the bird will pinball around the screen, retrieving items and killing enemies.\n\nAstal also includes a two-Player cooperative mode, with a second player controlling the bird. The bird can strike at the enemy with wings and beak using the B button, launch an arrow attack by holding down and then releasing the B button, or dive bomb the enemy by pressing and holding the C button while using left and right on the D-pad to control direction. The bird can also dash across the screen by pressing left or right twice and holding.\n\nSomewhere in the universe, the Goddess Antowas created a world from a single jewel. On this world, Quartilia, she created the sky, earth, and air. To inhabit this world, she created two humans: from a green jewel, a girl, Leda, who has the power to make things live on Quartilia; and from a red Jewel, a boy, Astal, whose purpose was to protect Leda. Content with her creation, Antowas slept.\n\nWhile she slept, the evil Jerado tried to take over Quartilia. To ensure victory, Jerado created a warrior: Geist. Geist kidnapped Leda, and held her at the bottom of the ocean. In an effort to get her back, Astal tore Quartilia apart, awakening Antowas. As punishment, Antowas banished Astal to Quartilia's moon. Leda took pity on Astal, and gave him her jewel. Once Astal and Jerado were dealt with, Antowas went back to sleep.\n\nHowever, Geist was still free, and Quartilia was not restored from the changes Jerado wrought. From his prison on the moon, Astal witnessed Geist kidnap Leda again. Consumed with the need to protect her, he freed himself and returned to Quartilia. Now Astal journeys in search of Leda through a Quartilia transformed by Jerado's dark design, along with a strange bird who for some reason just won't leave him alone...\n\nThe game had a number of differences between its Japanese and English language releases. In the Japanese version, Astal has five life points and unlimited continues. This was dropped to three life points and one continue in the North American version. In the Japanese version, the song \"Let Me Try Again\" that plays during the game's intro movie includes vocals. The North American version is instrumental. However, the vocal version can be heard by playing the game's CD in a standard CD player.\n\nThe Japanese voice cast had the titular character being voiced by Ai Orikasa, Leda, Yuri Shiratori, with Antowas and the Narrator being played by Aya Hisakawa, Geist being played by Ryo Horikawa, and Jerado, Daisuke Gōri. The monsters were voiced by Saori Wada, Toshiyasu Kamiko, Naoko Hamada, and Yasumaru Hotta. All voices in the North American version are performed by Lani Minella, who has voiced many different video game characters in her career, including Rouge the Bat and Omochao in Sega's \"Sonic Adventure 2\" and \"Sonic Heroes\".\n\nOn release, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" scored \"Astal\" 24 out of 40. \"GamePro\" criticized the game's visual aesthetic, saying that \"The beautifully drawn graphics are charming, but unfortunately they're charming in the style of those round-eyed-waif paintings.\" The reviewer added that the challenge would be too frustrating for children, and that the short stages leave the game with little longevity. He concluded that while it \"strengthens the Saturn's platform potential\", \"Astal\" is merely \"A good rental\". Electric Playground gave it 8 out of 10. Jennifer Diane Reitz reviewed the game positively but criticized it for being too short and having a limited number of actions available to players. Reitz summarized \"Astal\" as \"Exquisitely beautiful, lovely, wonderful fare. It is too short... but Astal is one hell of a ride while it lasts. A rare, but slightly flawed gem.\"\n\nIGN staff writer Levi Buchanan ranked \"Astal\" ninth in his list of the top 10 Sega Saturn games, noting that \"The game came out early in the Saturn's lifespan and was largely ignored -- no thanks to the garish box art. But those that did take Astal home cherished this beautiful example of a fading genre.\" However, another IGN writer gave it a 3 out of 10 and called it \"crappy\" and \"derivative\" albeit with \"pretty graphics\".\n\n\"Next Generation\" rated it three stars out of five, and stated that \"\"Astal\" is, in the end, a fine, side-scrolling action game, and if you already own a Saturn and you love side-scrolling action games, then this is a good one to pursue, but this game would not exactly make a good argument for buying a 32-bit machine.\"\n\n\"Astal\" often makes cameo appearances (usually in background shots, architecture, or large group shots) in the Sonic The Hedgehog comic book series by Archie Comics, courtesy of artist Patrick Spaziante. Astal (and the bird) have a one panel cameo in \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" issue #50. They appear alongside Bark the Polar Bear, Bean the Dynamite, Ray the Flying Squirrel, \"Ristar\", and Deku from \"Fighters Megamix\" fighting against the Overlanders (Humans) in a flashback/dream sequence of Dr. Robotnik.

Use of the term \"vibration white finger\" has generally been superseded in professional usage by broader concept of HAVS, although it is still used by the general public. The symptoms of vibration white finger are the vascular component of HAVS.\n\nHAVS is a widespread recognized industrial disease affecting tens of thousands of workers. It is a disorder that affects the blood vessels, nerves, muscles, and joints, of the hand, wrist, and arm. Its best known effect is vibration-induced white finger (VWF), a term introduced by the Industrial Injury Advisory Council in 1970. Injury can occur at frequencies between 5 and 2000 Hz but the greatest risk for fingers is between 50 and 300 Hz. The total risk exposure for hand and arm is calculated by the use of ISO 5349-1, which stipulates maximum damage between 8 and 16 Hz and a rapidly declining risk at higher frequencies. The ISO 5349-1 frequency risk assessment has been criticized as corresponding poorly to observational data; more recent research suggests that medium and high frequency vibrations also increase HAVS risk.\n\nExcessive exposure to hand arm vibrations can result in various patterns of diseases casually known as HAVS or VWF. This can affect nerves, joints, muscles, blood vessels or connective tissues of the hand and forearm:\n\n\nIn extreme cases, the sufferer may lose fingers. The effects are cumulative. When symptoms first appear, they may disappear after a short time. If exposure to vibration continues over months or years, the symptoms can worsen and become permanent.\n\nThe Control of Vibration at Work Regulations 2005, created under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. is the legislation in the UK that governs exposure to vibration and assists with preventing HAVS occurring.\n\nGood practice in industrial health and safety management requires that worker vibration exposure is assessed in terms of acceleration, amplitude, and duration. Using a tool that vibrates slightly for a long time can be as damaging as using a heavily vibrating tool for a short time. The duration of use of the tool is measured as trigger time, the period when the worker actually has their finger on the trigger to make the tool run, and is typically quoted in hours per day. Vibration amplitude is quoted in metres per second squared, and is measured by an accelerometer on the tool or given by the manufacturer. Amplitudes can vary significantly with tool design, condition and style of use, even for the same type of tool.\n\nIn the UK, Health and Safety Executive gives the example of a hammer drill which can vary from 6 m/s² to 25 m/s². HSE publishes a list of typically observed vibration levels for various tools, and graphs of how long each day a worker can be exposed to particular vibration levels. This makes managing the risk relatively straightforward. Tools are given an Exposure Action Value (EAV, the time which a tool can be used before action needs to be taken to reduce vibration exposure) and an Exposure Limit Value (ELV, the time after which a tool may not be used).\n\nIn the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health published a similar database where values for sound power and vibrations for commonly found tools from large commercial vendors in the United States were surveyed. Further testing is underway for more and newer tools.\n\nThe effect of legislation in various countries on worker vibration limits has been to oblige equipment providers to develop better-designed, better-maintained tools, and for employers to train workers appropriately. It also drives tool designers to innovate to reduce vibration. Some examples are the easily manipulated mechanical arm (EMMA) and the suspension mechanism designed into chainsaws.\n\nAnti vibration gloves are traditionally made with a thick and soft palm material to insulate from the vibrations. The protection is highly dependent on frequency range; most gloves provide no protection in palm and wrist below ~50 Hz and in fingers below ~400 Hz. Factors such as high grip force, cold hands or vibration forces in shear direction can have a reducing effect and or increase damage to the hands and arms. Gloves do help to keep hands warm but to get the desired effect, the frequency output from the tool must match the properties of the vibration glove that is selected. Anti-vibration gloves in many cases amplify the vibrations at frequencies lower than those mentioned in the text above.\n\nA simpler system, known as re-active monitoring, may be used by, for example, monitoring rates of usage of consumable items. Such a system was introduced by Carl West at a fabrication workshop in Rotherham, England. In this system, the vibration levels of the angle grinding tools in use was measured, as was the average life of a grinding disk. Thus by recording numbers of grinding disks used, vibration exposure may be calculated.\n\nThe symptoms were first described by Professor Giovanni Loriga in Italy in 1911, although the link was not made between the symptoms and vibrating hand tools until a study undertaken by Alice Hamilton MD in 1918. She formed her theory through following the symptoms reported by quarry cutters and carvers in Bedford, Indiana. She also discovered the link between an increase in HAV symptoms and cold weather as 1918 was a particularly harsh winter.\n\nThe first scale for assessing the condition, the Taylor-Pelmear scale, was published in 1975, but it was not listed as a prescribed disease in the United Kingdom until 1985, and the Stockholm scale was introduced in 1987. In 1997, the UK High Court awarded £127,000 in compensation to seven coal miners for vibration white finger. A UK government fund set up to cover subsequent claims by ex-coalminers had exceeded £100 million in payments by 2004.\n\n\n"}

She shared a role with Billie Piper in the television adaptation of \"A Passionate Woman\" which aired on BBC One on 11 April 2010.\n\nOn 2 April 2012, \"Coronation Street\" series producer Phil Collinson announced Johnston had joined the soap opera as Gloria, the mother of Stella Price (played by Michelle Collins). She made her first screen appearance on 5 September 2012. It was announced in June 2013 that Johnston would leave the soap opera in 2014 to pursue other acting roles. She departed on 21 February 2014.\n\nIn December 2011, she played Eileen Lewis in the BBC one-off drama \"Lapland\", a role which she reprised in 2013 for a series, \"Being Eileen\".\n\nIn May 2014 it was announced that Johnston would guest star in the fifth series of the period drama \"Downton Abbey\". She played Denker, a lady's maid to the Dowager Countess, played by Dame Maggie Smith.\n\nIn 2018 Johnston played Ivy-Rae in the BBC drama series, \"Age Before Beauty\" and in August 2019, she played Joan in the second series of \"Hold the Sunset\".\n\nJohnston has campaigned on behalf of the Labour Party and has been a long-time gay rights campaigner. She is a supporter of Liverpool F.C. and St Helens R.F.C..\n\nIn 1967, she married her first husband Neil Johnston and became pregnant at the age of 24. She suffered a miscarriage shortly after and the couple later divorced but she kept his surname as her professional name. She has one son, Joel, from her second marriage to David Pammenter. She has two grandchildren.\n\nDespite playing the role of heavy smoker Barbara Royle in \"The Royle Family\", Johnston gave up smoking in 1978, but had to smoke low-tar cigarettes while playing the role.This was because the cast and crew including herself could not stand the smell of herbal cigarettes. In fact, in most episodes of The Royle Family you will notice Johnston's character Barbara when lighting a cigarette didn't actually inhale. She also very seldom put the cigarette to her lips. In the final two Christmas specials Barbara wasn't seen smoking at all. Sue Johnston is strongly opposed to smoking.\n\nJohnston was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours. In November 2010, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by University of Chester at Chester Cathedral.\n\nIn 1989 Johnston, assisted by Lesley Thomson, published her first book, a memoir titled \"Hold on to the Messy Times\". In 2011, she published another memoir titled \"Things I Couldn't Tell My Mother\".\n\nIn 1970, Johnston was sexually attacked at the age of 27 which inspired her storyline in \"Brookside\" as Sheila Grant, where she was raped.\n\nIn her autobiography, \"Things I Couldn't Tell My Mother\", she states that she was originally going to be called Margaret Jane Wright, after her mother and grandmother, but her father thought that it would be best to call her Susan.\n\nFilm\nTelevision\nTelevision film\nAdditional credits\n"}

The most important properties are high temperature resistance, hardness (7 Mohs), low density, low electrical resistance, low friction, low thermal resistance, extreme resistance to chemical attack and impermeability to gases and liquids. Glassy carbon is widely used as an electrode material in electrochemistry, as well as for high temperature crucibles and as a component of some prosthetic devices, and can be fabricated as different shapes, sizes and sections.\n\nThe names \"glassy carbon\" and \"vitreous carbon\" have been introduced as trademarks; therefore, IUPAC does not recommend their use as technical terms.\n\nVitreous carbon can also be produced as a foam. It is then called reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC). This foam was first developed in the mid to late 1960s as a thermally insulating, microporous glassy carbon electrode material. RVC foam is a strong, inert, electrically and thermally conductive, and corrosion resistant porous form of carbon with a low resistance to gas and fluid flow. Due to these characteristics, the most widespread scientific use of RVC is as three-dimensional electrode in electrochemistry. Additionally, RVC foams are characterized by an exceptionally high void volume, high surface area, and very high thermal resistance in non-oxidising environments, which allows for heat sterilization and facilitates manipulation in biological applications.\n\nGlassy carbon was first observed in the laboratories of The Carborundum Company, Manchester, UK, in the mid-1950s by Bernard Redfern, a materials scientist and diamond technologist. He noticed that Sellotape he used to hold ceramic (rocket nozzle) samples in a furnace maintained a sort of structural identity after firing in an inert atmosphere.\nHe searched for a polymer matrix to mirror a diamond structure and discovered a resole resin that would, with special preparation, set without a catalyst. Using this phenolic resin, crucibles were produced. Crucibles were distributed to organisations such as UKAEA Harwell.\n\nBernard Redfern left The Carborundum Co., which officially wrote off all interests in the glassy carbon invention. While working at the Plessey Company laboratory (in a disused church) in Towcester, UK, Redfern received a glassy carbon crucible for duplication from UKAEA. He identified it as one he had made from markings he had engraved into the uncured precursor prior to carbonisation. (It is almost impossible to engrave the finished product.) The Plessey Company set up a laboratory first in a factory previously used to make briar pipes, in Litchborough, UK, and then a permanent facility at Caswell, near Blakesly, UK. Caswell became the Plessey Research Centre and then the Allen Clark Research Centre. Glassy carbon arrived at the Plessey Company Limited as a fait accompli. Redfern was assigned J.C. Lewis, as a laboratory assistant, for the production of glassy carbon. F.C. Cowlard was assigned to Redfern's department later, as a laboratory administrator. Cowlard was an administrator who previously had some association with Silane (Silane US Patent assignee 3,155,621 3 Nov 1964). Neither he nor Lewis had any previous connection with glassy carbon.\nThe contribution of Bernard Redfern to the invention and production of glassy / Vitreous carbon is acknowledged by his co-authorship of early articles. But references to Redfern were not obvious in subsequent publications by Cowlard and Lewis. Original boat crucibles, thick section rods and precursor samples exist.\n\nRedfern's UK patent application were filed on 11 January 1960 and Bernard Redfern was the author of US patent US3109712A, granted 5 November 1963, priority date 11 January 1960, filing date 9 January 1961. This came after the rescinded British patent.\nThis prior art is not referenced in US patent 4,668,496, 26 May 1987 for Vitreous Carbon. Patents were filed \"Bodies and shapes of carbonaceous materials and processes for their production\" and the name \"Vitreous Carbon\" presented to the product by the son of Redfern.\n\nGlassy/Vitreous Carbon was under investigation used for components for thermonuclear detonation systems and at least some of the patents surrounding the material were rescinded (in the interests of national security) in the 1960s.\n\nLarge sections of the precursor material were produced as castings, moldings or machined into a predetermined shape. Large crucibles and other forms were manufactured. Carbonisation took place in two stages. Shrinkage during this process is considerable (48.8%) but is absolutely uniform and predictable. A nut and bolt can be made to fit as the polymer, processed separately and subsequently give a perfect fit.\n\nSome of the first ultrapure samples of gallium arsenide were zone refined in these crucibles. (Glassy carbon is extremely pure and unreactive to GaAs).\n\nDoped/impure glassy carbon exhibited semiconductor phenomena.\n\nUranium carbide inclusions were fabricated (using U238 carbide at experimental scale).\n\nOn October 11, 2011, research conducted at the Carnegie Geophysical Laboratory led by Stanford’s Wendy L. Mao and her graduate student Yu Lin described a new form of glassy carbon formed under high pressure with hardness equal to diamond, a kind of diamond-like carbon. Unlike diamond, however its structure is that of amorphous carbon so its hardness may be isotropic. Research is ongoing.\n\nThe structure of glassy carbon has long been a subject of debate. Early structural models assumed that both sp- and sp-bonded atoms were present, but it is now known that glassy carbon is 100% sp. More recent research has suggested that glassy carbon has a fullerene-related structure.\n\nNote that glassy carbon should not be confused with amorphous carbon. This from IUPAC: \"Glass-like carbon cannot be described as amorphous carbon because it consists of two-dimensional structural elements and does not exhibit ‘dangling’ bonds.\"\n\nIt exhibits a conchoidal fracture.\n\nGlassy carbon electrode (GCE) in aqueous solutions is considered to be an inert electrode for hydronium ion reduction:\n\nComparable reaction on platinum:\n\nThe difference of 2.1 V is attributed to the properties of platinum which stabilizes a covalent Pt-H bond.\n\nProperties include 'high temperature resistance', hardness (7 Mohs), low density, low electrical resistance, low friction, and low thermal resistance. \n\nDue to their specific surface orientation, glassy carbon is employed as an electrode material for the fabrication of sensors. Glassy carbon paste, glassy carbon, carbon paste etc. electrodes when modified are termed as chemically modified electrodes.\nThe vitreous carbon and carbon/carbon fibre composites are used for dental implants and heart valves because\nof their bio-compatibility, stability and simple manufacturing techniques.\n\n\n"}

He was the second son of Rabbi Chaim Tzvi Teitelbaum, author of \"Atzei Chaim\", the previous Sigheter Rebbe. His mother Bracha Sima, hailed from the prominent Halbershtam family. Moshe and his older brother, Yekusiel Yehuda Teitelbaum, were orphaned in 1926, when they were eleven and fourteen, respectively. Moshe was raised by family friends and relatives, including his uncle, Joel Teitelbaum, and his grandfather, Rabbi Shulem Eliezer Halberstam of Ratzfert.\n\nTeitalbaum received rabbinical ordination and was appointed dean of the Karacscka yeshiva. In 1936, Teitelbaum married his cousin Leah Meir, daughter of Rabbi Hanoch Heinoch Meir of Karecska. In 1939, he became the rabbi of Senta, Yugoslavia (now Serbia).\n\nIn late spring 1944, the Hungarian government, assisted by Nazi forces led by Adolf Eichmann, began deporting Jews en-masse. Teitelbaum and his wife Leah were sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where his wife and three children were killed, and he nearly died. Teitelbaum was then transferred to the Brabag plant in , and afterwards to Theresienstadt, where he was liberated in 1945.\n\nIn 1946 Teitelbaum married another cousin Pessel Leah, the daughter of Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum of Volovo. Pessel Leah's entire family was killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\nThe couple initially moved back to Senta, where Teitelbaum led a congregation before the war. When he found out that his brother Yekusiel Yehuda Teitelbaum had been murdered in the Holocaust, he decided to fill his brother's position as rabbi of Sighet. Soon thereafter, they were forced to flee Communist persecution, leaving for Prague and then setting sail for New York City, where they arrived in fall 1947. There Teitelbaum became known as the Sigheter Rebbe, leading Sighet Chasiddus, previously led by his ancestors. He initially established a beth midrash, \"Atzei Chaim Siget\" in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and later moved to Borough Park, Brooklyn in 1966.\n\nIn 1979, Moshe's uncle Yoel died without an heir to inherit leadership of Satmar. The most logical successor was his nephew Moshe, then at the age of sixty six. He was considered intelligent, a scholar, and a good speaker. There was some uneasiness about appointing Moshe because in the years prior he had limited contact with Satmar, led his own Hasidic group, and did not necessarily have the same absolutist outlook, level of scholarship or intense piety, as his late uncle. Nevertheless, it was understood that the community was better off with a leader and having Moshe as the Rebbe was the best for the community under the given circumstances. The Satmar Council of Elders was a thirteen-member lay-person body elected by Satmar Hasidim. The Council unanimously decided on Moshe as their next Rebbe. Moshe could have turned down the appointment and remained as leader of his small Sighet sect, but leadership of Satmar promised far more power and prestige. The Council and Moshe then negotiated and planned the details on Moshe's official appointment. A few weeks later, on one day's notice, a general meeting in the main Rodney Street synagogue was announced. At the meeting, in which Moshe was not present, Sender Deutsch, leader of the Council announced the appointment of Moshe as the new rebbe of Satmar.\n\nMoshe refused to be accepted as the new rebbe within the first year of Joel's death. This was done as a sign of bereavement over his uncle who helped raise him when his father died and to allow the Satmar community to mourn and adjust to the transition. Moshe continued to live in Borough Park and lead his Sighet community.\n\nAround August 1980 Moshe formally succeeded Yoel as the Satmar Rebbe in an elaborate \"crowning\" in Kiryas Joel, New York. At the ceremony, Moshe spoke and acknowledged that he cannot replace Joel, telling the Chasidim not to expect from him what they received from Joel.\n\nSome Satmar Hasidim did not accept him as the rebbe, including the Bnei Yoel (or \"Kagners\", opponents), a group of Hasidim who remained loyal to Joel's wife Fayga Teitelbaum. Moshe Teitelbaum and his aunt Fayga never had a good relationship. Tension between the two began back when Fayga married Yoel Teitelbaum. Fayga was Joel's second wife and Joel already had a grown daughter. The grown daughter and Fayga fought over control of the household, and Moshe sided with his cousin against his aunt. Later, Yoel's daughter died, and Fayga failed to bear any children and an heir for Yoel.\n\nMoshe's start as Satmar Rebbe was marked with more controversy. Soon after becoming Rebbe, Moshe appointed his son Aaron as the chief rabbi and rosh yeshiva of the Satmar congregation in Kiryas Joel, New York essentially giving him authority over all the community's affairs. The residents of Kiryas Joel at that time resented the appointment of Aaron, having issues with his personality and controlling nature. Moshe also removed Yoel's established personnel from positions of authority and replaced them with his loyalists. \nConcerns about Moshe's level of piety also mounted. Likely false rumors circulated that in the negotiations between the Council and Moshe prior to Moshe ascending as Rebbe, Moshe made numerous compensation demands, including demands that property be placed in his name and special fees for High Holiday services. Other likely false rumors claimed that Moshe was engrossed in business, had a stock market ticker-tape in his house, and was busy promoting his real estate investments.\n\nAs Rebbe, Moshe recognized his stature relative to the stature of his uncle Yoel and considered himself a \"custodian\" of what Yoel created. He stated \"we must not blaze new trails, but study the teachings of my uncle.\" He continued many of the customs enacted by Yoel. The differences between Yoel and Moshe were noted in that, unlike the more mystical Yoel, Moshe was more practical and plain spoken. Moshe did not speak out against Zionism as often as Yoel, though that may be due to the fact that it did not have the same ideological draw during Moshe's tenure. Some complained that Moshe was not as charitable as Yoel, though that may be because Moshe did not raise as much charity funds as the more charismatic Yoel.\n\nIn 1989 tensions between Moshe and the Bnei Yoel were exacerbated. In an April 1989 Passover speech, Moshe referred to the Bnei Yoel as \"infidels.\" He later enacted a rule that new residents had to obtain permission from village leaders before moving in. In 1990, the two groups erupted in violence when a supporter of Fayga tried to erect a gate outside her home. A melee erupted, hundreds of angry Hasidim poured into the streets, three men were dragged from a car that was then set on fire, and three police officers were injured. Supporters of Alta Fayga in Kiryas Joel claimed that they have been physically attacked and profanities were written on their sidewalk.\n\nUnder Moshe's guidance, from 1980 until 2006, Satmar doubled in size to around 100,000–120,000 followers, the largest Hasidic group in the United States. At the time of his death, Satmar's real estate holdings were valued at hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nMoshe Teitelbaum was the author of a five-volume Hasidic commentary on the Bible entitled \"Berach Moshe\".\n\nIn May 1999, Moshe Teitelbaum appointed his third son, Zalman, as the local leader of the Williamsburg congregation. Until then he had been the leader of Satmar in Jerusalem. This was seen as a signal from Moshe that Zalman was to lead Satmar after his death, overturning the previous assumption that he would be succeeded by his eldest son, Aaron. He was his father's representative in communal affairs and assumed his father's responsibilities when his father traveled.\n\nMoshe's appointment of Zalman as the local leader caused factions to form around Aaron and Zalman. Aaron's supporters claimed that Moshe had been \"swayed by his advisers\" to appoint Zalman because they were concerned they would lose influence under Aaron's regime.\n\nIn April 2006, when Moshe died, the two sides negotiated through intermediaries over who would speak at his funeral, and in what order. Both sides declared their leader as the Rebbe.\n\nMoshe's will named Zalman as his successor but Aaron's supporters dispute its validity, claiming that Moshe had suffered from dementia since 1997.\n\nOn April 24, 2006, at the age of 91, Teitelbaum died of cancer. Tens of thousands of members of the Jewish community attended his funeral and burial procession in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and later in Kiryas Joel, New York. Eulogies in the main Satmar synagogue in Williamsburg were said by all the rebbe's children or their husbands in order of their respective ages. Teitelbaum was buried near his uncle Joel in the sect's cemetery in Kiryas Joel.\n\nThen Governor of New York State, George Pataki and Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg issued statements in remembrance of Moshe.\n\nMoshe was survived by his wife; four sons, Aaron, Lipa, Zalmen Leib, and Shulem; two daughters, Bracha Meisels and Hendy Halberstam. At the time of his death he had at least 86 grandchildren and great-grandchildren. At the time of his death, his first son Aaron and third son Zalmen Leib each claimed leadership of Satmar. The second son Lipa was the leader of a small congregation called Zenta-Beirach Moshe Shul in Williamsburg. His son in law, Rabbi Chaim Shia Halberstam was a Satmar rebbe in Monsey, New York.\n"}

He served in Kenya's provincial administration during which time he was given paramilitary training at the Embakasi General Service Unit (GSU) Training Centre. Later he served in various postings as a district officer before becoming the District Commissioner (DC) to Nakuru in 1986. As such he was part of Kenya's internal security and intelligence organisation and directly responsible to Hezekiah Oyugi, then the Permanent Secretary, Provincial and Internal Security.\n\nKenya's then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr Robert Ouko, was murdered on the morning of 13 February 1990, shot through the head, at the foot of Got Alila Hill, some 2.4 km from his country residence in Koru, near Kisumu, north western Kenya.\n\nAnguka's wife, Mrs Susan Ngeso Anguka was Dr Ouko's Personal Assistant at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also farmed land adjacent to Ouko's farm in Koru. Ultimately, Jonah Anguka was named in connection with the murder of Dr Ouko by five different authorities and individuals.\n\nOn 18 November 1991, at the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Ouko's murder the former Detective Superintendent John Troon who had led Scotland Yard’s investigation (at the request of the Kenyan government) into the killing, stated that, 'There is a possibility that Mr Anguka may have some involvement or knowledge' [of the murder.\n\nTroon was being questioned by Justice Akiwumi, Justice Gicheru and Bernard Chunga (State Prosecutor) during the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Dr Ouko's death when he raised the case for further investigation of Anguka. The transcript of the relevant hearing explains Troon's reasoning.\n\nAnguka was also named by the Kenyan police in a six-page section of their 'Further Investigations into the Death of the Late Dr Robert Ouko' in which they set out fourteen points as to why he should be considered a suspect.\n\nUltimately, Jonah Anguka was named in connection with the murder of Dr Ouko by six different authorities and individuals. Others who named him included Dr Ouko's brother Barrack Mbajah, Ouko's maid Salina Were, and in an anonymous written allegation sent to the Kenya police in December 1991 entitled \"Who Killed Dr. R.J. Ouko and Why?\"\n\nMr Justice Aganayana absolved Anguka, saying that. \"The manner the heinous act (of killing Dr. Ouko) was planned and eventually executed… was so neat and professional that it could not have been undertaken by an ordinary person in the nature of the accused.\"\n\nJudge Aganayana said, “… And given the time of the incident when the deceased is alleged to have left his home (around 3.00am) I wouldn't be convinced that after being massaged by Oddotte at 12.30am he (Anguka) would have left the house gone to Koru, removed the deceased from the house, taken him to some place where he was shot and then brought him to the scene and set his body on fire during that night, then went back at his house to be ready for duty at 7.15am…”\n\nIn this statement Judge Aganyana however, made a critical mistake: the forensic evidence adduced by Scotland Yard proved that Dr Ouko had been killed at the scene where his body was found.\n\nFor Cohen and Odhiambo, 'Anguka's partial and selective presence in the book was itself revealing.' They remarked on how Anguka, by his story, was present at so many of the key events during the search for Ouko and the investigation into his murder but silent about his presence at others. For them, how Anguka chose to write the story he was hardly present at all, except and especially when he could cast himself as a victim of the state'.\n\nProfessors Cohen and Odhiambo noted that Anguka was at the scene where the Dr Ouko's body was found within two hours of its discovery by the police. He was at Ouko's Koru home to answer the phone in Ouko's sitting room when Susan Anguka, his wife, called from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to tell him that the body had been found. He was the first to break the news of her husband's death to Mrs Ouko. He was at the airport to meet the Scotland Yard team and he introduced Detective Superintendent Troon to Hezerkiah Oyugi and told him the latter would oversee the investigation. He was with Troon when the safe was opened in Ouko's bedroom. He interposed himself as a translator when Ouko's maid Salina Were was interviewed by Troon. He was with the Kenyan pathologist at Got Alila Hill when Ouko's body was first examined and he was also in Nairobi when Scotland Yard's forensic scientist Dr Iain West undertook an autopsy.\n\nAnguka did not mention in that he was at the airport to meet Troon's team, writing only, 'on 21 February New Scotland Yard detectives arrived'.\n\nSimilarly, Cohen and Odhiambo suggested Anguka had 'largely airbrushed' his relationship with Hezekiah Oyugi (named by Scotland Yard as a prime suspect) from his account, noting that, 'the book is silent on Anguka's relationship, official and private, with Hezekiah Oyugi. His exceptional access to Oyugi had no reciprocal aspect in Anguka's telling, and that silence certainly \"tells\" a stronger story than Jonah Anguka intended.'\n\nDuring the Scotland Yard investigation into the murder, Selina's accounts were regarded as the most truthful owing to the fact that she was the last person to see the minister to his bedroom. Former Kisumu Town East MP Gor Sunguh says the death of the witness is a possible pointer to the end of the inquiry and the revelation of truth. Gor Sunguh, who chaired the commission that probed Ouko's death, says more than 100 witnesses have so far disappeared in questionable circumstances. He says this will make it impossible for Kenyans to ever find out the truth. However, some argue that truth will be known, considering that majority of the witnesses had spoken before various investigating bodies. Selina was one of the few remaining witnesses. Some of the living witnesses include former DC Jonah Anguka, Zablon Agallo who was an Administration Police officer, Ouko's bodyguard Gordon Okoth, Phillip Ogutu (the gate keeper), Eric Ouko and James Onyango K'Oyoo. Many witnesses have died in mysterious circumstances over two decades since Ouko's murder, however in a recent documentary series aired on Citizen TV in March 2017, the idea of the \"mysterious deaths\" surrounding the killing of Dr Robert Ouko has been robustly challenged.\n\nJonah Anguka continues to live in California, United States, is an active member of the local community and a fundraiser for social projects in the Western Kenya region.\n\n\n\n"}

The Americans credited him as the mastermind of the Balangiga massacre, in which more than forty American troopers were killed. Later investigations by historians however, disclosed that Lukbán played no actual part in the planning of the attack.\n\nLukbán was born in Labo, Camarines Norte on February 11, 1860 to Agustin Lukbán of Ambos Camarines and Andrea Rilles of Lucban, Tayabas. He is the brother of Justo Lukban. He completed his early education at \"Escuela Pia\" in Lucban, continued his studies at Ateneo Municipal de Manila, and took up Bachelor of Laws at the University of Santo Tomas and Colegio de San Juan de Letran.\n\nHe returned to Labo after resigning from his job at the Manila Court of First Instance. He married Sofía Dízon Barba and the union produced four children: Cecilia, Félix, Agustín, and Vicente, Jr. Sofía died after their last child was born. Lukbán then left his children in the care of his siblings so that he could devote his time to the cause of the revolution.\n\nLukbán, thereafter, accepted the post of Justice of the Peace. In 1884, he was inducted into Freemasonry, \"Luz de Oriente\" (\"Light of the Orient\"). The organization had attracted many intellectuals and middle-class Filipinos to its ranks. In 1886, he stopped working in the judicial office and busied himself with agriculture and commerce in Bicol. He formed \"La Cooperativa Popular\" aimed at promoting the cooperative business activities of small and medium scale producers with the aim to increase their income from the lands by selling their products without passing through middle men. Part of the profits of the cooperatives were secretly remitted to the revolutionary movement of Andrés Bonifacio, the Katipunan. The cooperative also served as an effective covert means of spreading the ideals of the revolution. Their members could move around freely without arousing the suspicion of the Spanish authorities.\n\nBy 1896, Lukbán had centralized the funds of the cooperatives into the coffers of the revolution. He periodically remitted money to the evolving revolutionary movement. At the same time, he acted as an emissary of the Katipunan unit in Bicol to gather information about the Spanish movements in Manila and to determine how such movements affected Bicol provinces. On one of his trips to Manila, he was arrested by the \"guardia civiles\", (\"civil guards\") and charged with conspiring to overthrow the government. He was imprisoned in Bilibid prison and tortured at Fort Santiago. While Lukbán was still in prison, the Philippine Revolution began. On August 18, 1897, he was released from jail, together with Juan Luna and immediately thereafter, joined the revolutionary government’s armed forces.\n\nIn the army, he was commissioned to serve as one of Emilio Aguinaldo's officers. Lukbán was among the few who assisted Aguinaldo in planning war strategies and activities. When the Pact of Biak-na-Bato was signed, he was asked by Aguinaldo to be one of the members of his party going into exile in Hong Kong. Lukban spent his exile in Hong Kong studying military science under the Lord Commander Joseph Churchase of the British Naval command. This enabled him to master the arts of soldiery — fencing, shooting, gunpowder and ammunitions preparations, and the planning and execution of war strategies and tactics.\n\nShortly after Aguinaldo proclaimed Philippine Independence in 1898, Lukbán was sent to the Bicol region to direct military operations against the Spaniards. His successes in Bicol ushered him into a new and challenging assignment: as Leyte and Samar's politico-military chief. Lukbán married his second wife Paciencia Gonzales in Samar. This union produced eight children: Victoria, Juan, María, Fidel, Rosita, Ramon, José and Lourdes.\n\nOn December 31, 1899, a hundred riflemen under Lukbán gathered and he proclaimed himself the new governor of Samar under the First Philippine Republic. When the U.S. 1st Infantry Regiment landed on Samar’s shores in January 1901, they were met by infantry charges under Lukbán’s command. Nevertheless, Lukban was soon forced to retreat into the island's interior, leaving behind an organized resistance network. Samareños caught cooperating with the Americans were executed swiftly and dramatically. When U.S. General Arthur MacArthur offered Lukban amnesty in exchange for his surrender, he turned it down and swore to fight to the end.\n\nAfter Baldomero Aguinaldo’s capture in 1901, Samar, under Lukbán's leadership, remained one of the few areas of Filipino resistance. American troops encountered few enemies to fight in the open, finding themselves constantly harassed by Lukbán's guerrillas. However, two prisoners later revealed the location of Lukbán’s secret headquarters along the Cadac-an River, Basey, Samar. The prisoners warned that the fort was impregnable, but Major Littleton Waller sent scouts to investigate. On November 17, 1901, Waller attacked with an amphibious assault team up the river, as Captains Bearss and Porter attacked by land with forces from Basey and Balangiga. The amphibious assault was foiled by a Filipino trap, and Porter attacked alone. The Filipino soldiers fled before machine gun fire, leaving scaling ladders behind for the Americans. The retreating Filipinos were gunned down from behind as the American flag was raised above the garrison. It was a clear victory for the United States, with 30 Filipinos dead. The war on Samar, however, would not truly be over until the rugged interior, controlled by the Pulahanes was conquered.\n\nLukban was captured on 18 February 1902 in Catubig, Samar.\n\nLukbán's career did not end with his captivity. He was elected governor of Tayabas (now Quezon province) in 1912 and re-elected in 1916. He died at his Manila residence on November 16, 1916.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2056004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056004", "title": "Prairie vole", "text": "Prairie vole\n\nThe prairie vole (\"Microtus ochrogaster\") is a small vole found in central North America.\nThe vole has long, coarse grayish-brown fur on the upper portion of the body and yellowish fur on the lower portion of the body. It has short ears and a short tail, which is somewhat darker on top.\n\nThe prairie vole's scientific name, \"Microtus ochrogaster\", is derived from Greek; the genus name translates to \"small ear\" and the specific epithet translates to \"yellow belly\". They are found in grasslands in the central United States and Canada; ranging from the eastern Rocky Mountains in the west to West Virginia in the east and into the Canadian Prairies to the north.\n\nThe Prairie vole resides in dry fields that contain a cover of grasses and weeds, the largest populations are typically found in fallow fields or hay fields. Prairie voles make shallow burrows and runways through surface vegetation. In winter, they tunnel underneath the snow. Their runways are used for many purposes, from predator protection to obtaining food. Prairie voles are easily disturbed. They will not hesitate to use their burrows if they notice predators close by or disturbances that pose a threat. Compared to the meadow vole, prairie voles prefer to inhabit drier areas.\n\nPrairie voles are active year-round. In colder weather, they tend to be more active during the day; at other times, they are mainly nocturnal. Prairie voles live in colonies and have been known to exhibit human-like social behavior in groups.\n\nPrairie voles rarely live longer than one or two years. Their life expectancy is based on predator presence and natural factors in their area of inhabitance.\n\nPrairie voles are primarily herbivorous, feeding on grasses, roots, fruit, seeds and bark and some insects. These voles store food. Predators include coyotes, hawks, owls, foxes and snakes. They may cause damage to garden plants and small trees.\n\nDuring mating season, prairie voles take up individual territories and defend them from other voles. They mark their territories with urine and other secretions. They assume a defensive posture towards a competitor or enemy by raising the forefeet, extending the head forward, and chattering of the teeth. Outside the mating seasons, the prairie voles live together.\n\nLike other voles, prairie voles can reproduce at any time of the year, but the main breeding seasons are in the fall and the spring. Unlike other voles, prairie voles are generally monogamous. The prairie vole is a notable animal model for studying monogamous behavior and social bonding because male and female partners form lifelong pair bonds, huddle and groom each other, share nesting and pup-raising responsibilities, and generally show a high level of affiliative behavior. However, they are not sexually faithful, and though pair-bonded females usually show aggression toward unfamiliar males, both sexes will occasionally mate with other voles if the opportunity arises.\n\nThe female's gestation period is between 20 and 30 days. Female voles have two to four litters of two to seven young per year in a nest lined with vegetation in a burrow or in a depression on the ground. Litter size varies depending on food availability and the age of the female. The largest number of pregnancies with the highest offspring occur in spring and fall. Baby voles open their eyes at about eight days after birth, and become capable of feeding themselves at about two weeks.\n\nPrairie voles are important to the ecosystem. They provide food for predators, but are considered pests by some. Many ways to prevent voles from destroying gardens or other areas are available. Electric repellers and predators (snakes, owls, coyotes, foxes, domestic animals, and hawks) can be used to reduce vole populations. They can also be scared away by plastic ornaments that resemble natural predators. \n\nThough poison is an option to prevent voles, poisoned voles can create a threat to other animals and humans. Voles are prey for other predators. If they are eaten by predators while poisoned, the poison could harm the predator. In addition, when placing poison near vole entrances, other animals may be able to reach it, making it a hazard to them. Moreover, poison left in the field can easily be blown or washed away. In residential areas, the poison itself and poisoned voles can be harmful and/or dangerous to people and domesticated animals. If a licensed pest control company is involved they can mitigate any poisoning concerns through the use of proper exterior bait stations.\n\nThe prairie vole is special for having pair bonding with its partner. The male prairie vole has a continuous contact with its female counterpart, which lasts for all of their lives. If the female prairie vole dies, the male does not look for a new partner. Moreover, this constant relationship is more social than sexual. For this pair bonding to take place, the male must stay one day with the female after they breed. Other species, such as the montane vole, do not show this pair bonding behavior.\n\nThis uniqueness in the prairie vole behavior is related to the oxytocin and vasopressin hormones. The oxytocin receptors of the female prairie vole brain are located more densely in the reward system, and have more receptors than other species, which causes 'addiction' to the social behavior.\nIn the male prairie vole, the gene for the vasopressin receptor has a longer segment, as opposed to the montane vole, which has a smaller segment. This segment is longer in other bonding animals (such as humans), and shorter in other nonbonding animals (such as chimpanzees).\n\nPrairie voles in Missouri have been found to carry Bloodland Lake virus (BLLV), a hantavirus. Hantaviruses are responsible for disease in humans including Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. No known human cases of Bloodland Lake virus have been reported.\n\n\n"}

His biggest hits were his versions of \"Release Me\" and \"Reconsider Me\" in the late 1960s.\n\nAdams was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, the oldest of 10 children. He became a professional musician on leaving school. He began his career singing gospel with the Soul Revivers and Bessie Griffin's Consolators, but crossed over to secular music in 1959. His neighbor, the songwriter Dorothy LaBostrie, supposedly persuaded him to start performing secular music after hearing him sing in the bathtub. He recorded LaBostrie's ballad \"I Won't Cry\" for Joe Ruffino's Ric label. Produced by the teenaged Mac Rebennack (later known as Dr. John), the record became a local hit. Adams recorded several more singles for the label over the next three years, most of them produced by Rebennack or Eddie Bo. His first national hit came in 1962, when \"A Losing Battle\", written by Rebennack, reached number 27 on the \"Billboard\" R&B chart.\n\nAfter Ruffino's death in 1963, Adams left Ric and recorded for a succession of labels, including Eddie Bo's Gone Records, the Los Angeles–based Modern Records, and Wardell Quezergue's Watch label. His records had little success until he signed with Shelby Singleton's Nashville-based SSS International Records in 1968. A reissue of \"Release Me\", originally released by Watch, reached number 34 on the R&B chart and number 82 on the pop chart. Its follow-up, \"Reconsider Me\", a country song produced by Singleton, became his biggest hit, reaching number 8 on the R&B chart and number 28 on the pop chart in 1969. Two more singles, \"I Can't Be All Bad\" and \"I Won't Cry\" (a reissue of the Ric recording), were lesser hits later the same year, and the label released an album, \"Heart and Soul\".\n\nAdams left SSS International in 1971 and recorded unsuccessfully for several labels, including Atlantic and Ariola, over the next few years. At the same time, he began performing regularly at Dorothy's Medallion Lounge in New Orleans and touring nightclubs in the south.\n\nIn 1983, he signed with Rounder Records, for which he recorded nine critically acclaimed albums produced by Scott Billington, beginning with \"From the Heart\" in 1984. These records encompassed a wide range of jazz, blues and R&B styles and highlighted Adams's voice. The albums included tributes to the songwriters Percy Mayfield and Doc Pomus. The jazz-influenced \"Good Morning Heartache\" included the work of composers like George Gershwin and Harold Arlen. Other albums in this series are \"Room with a View of the Blues\" (1988), \"Walking on a Tightrope\" (1989), and \"The Real Me\" (1991). These recordings earned him a number of awards, including a W.C. Handy Award. He also toured internationally, with frequent trips to Europe, and worked and recorded with such musicians as Aaron Neville, Harry Connick Jr., Lonnie Smith, and Dr. John.\n\nHe died in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 1998 after a long battle with prostate cancer.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2056035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056035", "title": "Neuromelanin", "text": "Neuromelanin\n\nNeuromelanin (NM) is a dark pigment found in the brain which is structurally related to melanin. It is a polymer of 5,6-dihydroxyindole monomers. Neuromelanin is found in large quantities in catecholaminergic cells of the substantia nigra pars compacta and locus coeruleus, giving a dark color to the structures.\n\nNeuromelanin gives specific brain sections, such as the substantia nigra or the locus coeruleus, distinct color. It is a type of melanin and similar to other forms of peripheral melanin. It is insoluble in organic compounds, and can be labeled by silver staining. It is called neuromelanin because of its function and the color change that appears in tissues containing it. It contains black/brown pigmented granules. Neuromelanin is found to accumulate during aging, noticeably after the first 2–3 years of life. It is believed to protect neurons in the substantia nigra from iron-induced oxidative stress. It is considered a true melanin due to its stable free radical structure and it avidly chelates metals.\n\nNeuromelanin is directly biosynthesized from L-DOPA, precursor to dopamine, by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic acid decarboxylase (AADC). Alternatively, synaptic vesicles and endosomes accumulate cytosolic dopamine (via vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) and transport it to mitochondria where it is metabolized by monoamine oxidase. Excess dopamine and DOPA molecules are oxidized by iron catalysis into dopaquinones and semiquinones which are then phagocytosed and are stored as neuromelanin.\n\nNeuromelanin biosynthesis is driven by excess cytosolic catecholamines not accumulated by synaptic vesicles.\n\nNeuromelanin is found in higher concentrations in humans than in other primates. Neuromelanin concentration increases with age, suggesting a role in neuroprotection (neuromelanin can chelate metals and xenobiotics) or senescence.\n\nNeuromelanin-containing neurons in the substantia nigra undergo neurodegeneration during Parkinson's disease. Motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are caused by cell death in the substantia nigra, which may be partly due to oxidative stress. This oxidation may be relieved by neuromelanin. Patients with Parkinson's disease had 50% the amount of neuromelanin in the substantia nigra as compared to similar patients of their same age, but without Parkinson's. The death of neuromelanin-containing neurons in the substantia nigra, pars compacta, and locus coeruleus have been linked to Parkinson's disease and also have been visualized \"in vivo\" with neuromelanin imaging.\n\nNeuromelanin has been shown to bind neurotoxic and toxic metals that could promote neurodegeneration.\n\nDark pigments in the substantia nigra were first described in 1838 by Purkyně, and the term neuromelanin was proposed in 1957 by Lillie, though it has been thought to serve no function until recently. It is now believed to play a vital role in preventing cell death in certain parts of the brain. It has been linked to Parkinson's disease and because of this possible connection, neuromelanin has been heavily researched in the last decade.\n"}

He wrote the first paper defining the mathematical principles of plate tectonics on a sphere, and his early work on mantle convection created the modern discussion of planetary interiors.\n\nBorn in Cheltenham, the son of an ear, nose, and throat surgeon, he first attended Westminster Under School and later Westminster School, London.\n\nMcKenzie attended King's College, Cambridge where he read physics, obtaining a 2:1 in his final degree.\n\nAs a graduate student, he worked with Edward \"Teddy\" Bullard who suggested he work on the subject of thermodynamic variables. He was awarded a Research Fellowship at King's College at the beginning of his second year which enabled him to study anything he wanted. As such, he gave up doing what Teddy had suggested and became interested in how the interior of the earth convects, something completely speculative at that time. McKenzie taught himself fluid mechanics and then went to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, on the invitation of Freeman Gilbert and Walter Munk. After eight months he returned to Cambridge, submitting his PhD in 1966. He has since said that nothing in his early life as a scientist had such a profound effect on him as those eight months in California.\n\nSpending time between Cambridge and a Fellowship held in Caltech, McKenzie was invited, along with Teddy Bullard, to a conference in New York which initiated his revolutionary work on plate tectonics. After listening to separate talks from Fred Vine on plate tectonics, looking at the thermal structure of oceanic plates as they formed and cooled.\n\nFollowing this, he published a seminal paper with Bob Parker, which employed Euler's Fixed Point Theorem, in conjunction with magnetic anomalies and earthquakes to determine a precise mathematical theory on plate tectonics. This work was published some 3–4 months after the same work had been carried out by Jason Morgan at Princeton. Allegations were subsequently made suggesting that McKenzie was at Morgan's spring AGU talk where he presented his plate tectonics work. Later in 1968 he went to Princeton where he found that he and Morgan had solved two or three problems using identical mathematics in exactly the same way – plate tectonics was one, another was the thermal structure of the oceans and another was looking at earthquake mechanisms in a different way to seismologists.\n\nWorking with John Sclater, McKenzie determined the entire geological history of the Indian Ocean, the publication of which eventually resulted in them both receiving Fellowships at the Royal Society.\n\nMcKenzie was awarded a University position and took it up in 1969. At this point he decided to move away from plate tectonics, choosing instead to focus on the behavior of fluids below the plates. He studied cellular convection and motions in the mantle whilst at the same time pursuing yet another new avenue of research; the development of sedimentary basins. It was from this work that he produced a classic paper that has been widely accepted by oil companies as the \"McKenzie Model of Sedimentary Basins.\"\n\nMcKenzie was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1976 aged just 34, and by 1978 was awarded a University Readership position.\n\nMcKenzie continues to work at the Bullard Laboratories in Cambridge where he is Professor of Earth Science. Most recently his research has provided new insights into the tectonic evolution of Mars and Venus. In 2002 he was awarded the prestigious Crafoord Prize from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for his contributions to research in the field of plate tectonics, sedimentary basin formation and mantle melting. With his appointment as a Companion of Honour in 2003, he brought the then current Cambridge membership of this elite group to four: Brenner, McKenzie, Hobsbawm and Hawking.\n\n\n\n"}

Texas, 347 U.S. 475 (1954), was a landmark case, \"the first and only Mexican-American civil-rights case heard and decided by the United States Supreme Court during the post-World War II period.\" In a unanimous ruling, the court held that Mexican Americans and all other nationality groups in the United States have equal protection under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The ruling was written by Chief Justice Earl Warren. This was the first case in which Mexican-American lawyers had appeared before the Supreme Court.\n\nPeter Hernandez, a Mexican-American agricultural worker, was convicted for the 1951 murder of Joe Espinosa, a man that he shot in cold blood at a bar in Edna, Texas. Hernandez's \"pro bono\" legal team, including Gustavo C. García, appealed the ruling claiming that he was being discriminated because there were no Mexicans in the jury that convicted him. They wanted to challenge what they knew was \"the systematic exclusion of persons of Mexican origin from all types of jury duty in at least seventy counties in Texas.\" They claimed that Hernandez had the right to be tried by a jury of his peers under the 14th amendment. The problem was that the 14th amendment was a special civil rights protection intended for blacks, and Pete Hernandez was white. The State of Texas denied their claim, arguing that Mexicans were white and the 14th amendment did not protect white nationality groups. \n\nHernandez's legal team appealed, claiming that Mexican Americans, although white, were treated as a class apart and subject to social discrimination in Jackson County, where the case had been tried, and therefore were deserving of 14th amendment protection. The challenge was then to prove that Mexicans were being discriminated and were excluded from the grand jury and jury. Hernandez's defense lawyers demonstrated that, although numerous Mexican Americans were citizens and had otherwise qualified for jury duty in Jackson County, during the previous 25 years no Mexican Americans (or, more precisely, no one with a Hispanic surname) were among the 6,000 persons chosen to serve on juries. This resulted in Hernandez having been deprived of equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment, as juries were restricted by ethnicity.\n\nThey appealed to the United States Supreme Court through a writ of certiorari. The legal team included García, Carlos Cadena and John J. Herrera of the League of United Latin American Citizens, and James DeAnda and Cris Alderete of the G. I. Forum, both activist groups for civil rights for Mexican Americans. These were the first Mexican-American lawyers to represent a defendant before the US Supreme Court, which heard their arguments on January 11, 1954.\n\nChief Justice Earl Warren and the rest of the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of Hernandez, and required he be retried by a jury composed without discrimination against Mexican Americans.\n\nThe court omitted the focus of race by declaring that other factors influence whether or not a group may need constitutional protection. To determine if discriminatory factors were present in Jackson County, the court investigated the treatment of Mexican Americans. They discovered a county-wide distinction between \"white\" and \"Mexican\" persons. At least one restaurant prominently displayed a sign that declared, \"No Mexicans Served.\" Additionally, until a few years earlier, some Mexican American children attended segregated schools and were forced to drop out by fifth or sixth grade. These factors led the Supreme Court to their ultimate ruling that the Fourteenth Amendment protects persons beyond the racial classes of white or black, and extends protection to nationality groups as well.\n\nThe ruling was an extension of protection in the Civil Rights Movement to nationality groups within the country and an acknowledgement that, in certain times and places, groups other than blacks (African Americans) could be discriminated against. The ultimate effect of this ruling was that the protection of the 14th Amendment was ruled to cover any national or ethnic groups of the United States for which discrimination could be proved.\n\nThe oral arguments of this case have been lost.

It features 51 water slides and dozens of various attractions. The park is located in the village of Lake Delton, Wisconsin.\n\nIn 1979, the Waterman family purchased of frontage property on U.S. Route 12 in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin and created a bumper boat ride and built a go-kart track. The park opened as \"Noah's Incredible Adventure,\" which became the name of a Noah's Ark attraction in 2003. In 1994, the Gantz family of Dubuque, Iowa, purchased Noah's Ark and added the \"OctoExplorer\", a yellow submarine with moving periscope, water guns and soft-surfaced waterslides. In 2003, Noah's Ark Waterpark celebrated 25 years of operation. In 2012, the park was purchased by Palace Entertainment.\nWhile under ownership of Palace Entertainment, six attractions have been closed and three have been added. Other changes include fencing the park's perimeter, removing of per-use lockers, and instituting a fee for parking.\n\nThe iconic ark structure at the front of the park was destroyed by an electrical fire in 2012. Originally a ticket office, the ark was being used as a museum and storage facility at the time of the fire.\n\nThe park uses over 2 million gallons of water on its rides every day. Its lifeguards earned the Platinum Award from Jeff Ellis and Associates Inc. (2006, 2017), the highest waterpark safety rating possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was nicknamed \"Kadhal Mannan\" (King of Romance) for the romantic roles he played in films. Ganesan was one of the \"three biggest names of Tamil cinema\", the other two being M. G. Ramachandran (known by his initials as MGR) and Sivaji Ganesan. While Sivaji Ganesan excelled in dramatic films and Ramachandran was popular as an action hero, Gemini Ganesan was known for his romantic films. A recipient of the Padma Shri in 1971, he had also won several other awards including the \"Kalaimamani\", the \"MGR Gold Medal\" and the \"Screen Lifetime Achievement Award\". He came from an intercaste family, and was one of the few graduates to enter the film industry at that time.\n\nGemini Ganesan made his debut with \"Miss Malini\" in 1947, but was noticed only after playing the villain in \"Thai Ullam\" in 1953. After playing the lead role in \"Manam Pola Mangalyam\" (1954), he finally acquired star status. However, unlike Sivaji Ganesan or Ramachandran, Gemini Ganesan was not originally a stage performer, and was never involved in politics. In his long film career spanning over five decades, Ganesan acted in more than 200 films. His performances on the screen were enhanced by successful playback singers such as A. M. Rajah and P. B. Sreenivas. In spite of his celebrated film career, Ganesan's personal life, particularly his marriages to multiple women over the years, has often been a subject of criticism. He married the famous South Indian actress Savitri with whom he had a daughter and a son. He won two Filmfare Awards.\n\nGemini Ganesan was born as Ramasamy Iyer Ganesan in 1920 to an inter-caste couple, Ramasamy Iyer and Gangammal. Ganesan's grandfather, Narayanaswami, was the principal of the Maharajah's College, Pudukkottai. Early in his life, Narayanaswami was married to a Brahmin girl of his own subcaste, but he later made another (informal) alliance, with a woman named Chandramma from the Isai Vellalar community of musicians and dancers. Chandramma legally was not the wife of Narayanaswami; the system known as \"Chinna Veedu\" (mistress) was fairly common in those days, and the typical situation was for a wealthy gentleman to consort with a woman from isai Vellalar . Notable among Narayanaswami's children with Chandramma were Muthulakshmi and Ramaswamy, father of Gemini Ganesan. Ramaswamy married Bhagirthi Amma (or Bagirathi Amma), a woman of his mother's community. Ganesan was the son of Ramaswamy and Bhagirathi Amma.\n\nWhen Ganesan was in the sixth grade, his grandfather died and not long after that, his father too died. Meanwhile, Muthulakshmi (now known as Muthulakshmi Reddi) had studied well and become a doctor; she was affluent and educated and had thoroughly abandoned the style of life followed by her mother and maternal ancestors, so much so that she became the leader of a social reform movement aimed at eradicating the \"Devadasi\" system. She was instrumental in ensuring the passage through parliament of the Devadasi Abolition Act. After the death of his father, Ganesan, along with his mother Bagirathi, moved to his aunt Muthulakshmi's home in Madras (now known as Chennai). Muthulakshmi provided shelter to her mother Chandramma and also to Bagirathi and Ganesan, but she was very dismissive and insulting towards her destitute relatives and she felt ashamed of them because of their background as courtesans. She heaped many insults on the two widowed women, and ensured that they did not show their faces to any guests who visited the house. Unhappy with the situation, Chandramma and Bagirathi returned to Pudukkottai. However, they left Ganesan with his aunt so he would grow into an educated and respectable man.\n\nSince Muthulakshmi was an ardent follower of Ramakrishna, she decided to enrol Ganesan into Ramakrishna Mission Home. While there, he was taught yoga and Sanskrit and was made to read the Upanishads, Vedas and Bhagavad Gita. However, he could not bear being separated from his mother, who was in Pudukkottai, so he returned to his native place and studied at a high school there. Later on, he joined Maharajah's College, located in the same place. However, he completed his graduation from Madras Christian College, Chennai.\n\nGanesan's dream was to become a doctor. In April 1940, he went to Trichinopoly (now Tiruchirappalli) to see T. R. Alamelu. Alamelu's father proposed his daughter in marriage and promised him a medical seat after graduation. Ganesan immediately agreed and married Alamelu in June 1940. Alamelu lost her father and elder sister within one month of her marriage. Ganesan's dreams of becoming a doctor were shattered. There was no choice left for him but to find a job immediately as he was the only person to support his family. He got an interview from the Indian Air Force. Much against Alamelu's wishes, Ganesan went to Delhi. In Delhi, he met his uncle Narayanaswami who advised him to become a teacher. Finally, Ganesan worked as a lecturer in the Chemistry department of Madras Christian College. Later in 1947, he obtained work as a production executive in Gemini Studios, from where the title \"Gemini\" became prefixed to his name. He debuted in film from the casting department of the Studio itself.\n\nFrom the casting department, Ganesan made his film debut in 1947 with the satire \"Miss Malini\", in a minor role. The film, which was based on a story by R. K. Narayan, and cast him alongside his future wife Pushpavalli, was a box office failure as it was considered \"ahead of its time\", but was well received by intellectuals. No print of that film is known to survive, making it a lost film. This was followed by \"Chakradhari\", in which he played another minor role as the Hindu god Krishna. The film was a box office success, but his performance went unnoticed. It was not until 1953, when he played a negative role in \"Thai Ullam\", did people take notice of him as an actor. The next year, he appeared in a supporting role in the Gemini Studios film \"Moondru Pillaigal\", which was unsuccessful. He was then cast as a hero for the first time with \"Manam Pola Mangalyam\". The film, which featured him in a dual role, paired him with his future wife Savitri, and became a \"milestone in his life\". From then on, he carved out a niche for himself in Tamil cinema with films that favoured romance over action.\n\nIn a career spanning nearly 50 years, Ganesan played a variety of roles, from Abhimanyu in \"Mayabazar\" (1957), to resistance fighter Madasamy in \"Kappalottiya Thamizhan\" (1961), and in \"Pennin Perumai\" (1960), he played a \"non-assertive imbecile morphing into a well-moulded human being\". Ganesan also starred in \"Kalathur Kannamma\" (1959), which was also the debut for Kamal Haasan, who would later become one of the leading actors in Tamil cinema. The film won the Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film in 1961. Ganesan also starred in \"Veerapandiya Kattabomman\" (1959), alongside Sivaji Ganesan. The film was selected for the Afro-Asian Film Festival in 1960. It was also nominated for the National Film Award in 1960, along with Gemini Ganesan's \"Kalyana Parisu\", but both lost to \"Bhaaga Pirivinai\". The Ruritanian romance film \"Vanjikottai Valiban\" (1958) was a high budget film and became a large commercial success due to much hype. The historical fiction film \"Parthiban Kanavu\" (1960) won the President's Silver Medal for Best Feature Film, but failed commercially.\n\nGanesan's 1961 film \"Then Nilavu\", was the first Tamil film to be shot extensively in Jammu and Kashmir, and became a major box-office success. He co-starred with rival actor M. G. Ramachandran in \"Mugarasi\" (1966), which was their only film together. \"Konjum Salangai\" (1962), which featured Ganesan alongside Savithri was released in various countries outside India, having subtitles in over 22 languages, and it was also the first Tamil film to be released in Poland, in a dubbed version. Ganesan produced \"Naan Avan Illai\" (1974), in which he played a womaniser. Directed by K. Balachander, this film won critical praise for Ganesan's performance, but according to Ganesan, the film did not succeed commercially. Some of his other known works include \"Missiamma\", \"School Master\", \"Kanavane Kankanda Deivam\", \"Meenda Sorgam\", \"Shanti Nilayam\", \"Vaazhkai Padagu\", \"Karpagam\", \"Ramu\", \"Thamarai Nenjam\" and \"Punnagai\". Ganesan had paired with several leading actresses like Anjali Devi, Pushpavalli, Padmini, Vyjayanthimala, Savitri, Devika, Vijayakumari, Saroja Devi, Rajasree, Kanchana, Jayanthi, K. R. Vijaya, Bharathi and Jayalalithaa.\n\nGemini Ganesan acted in a few Hindi films, most of which were remakes of his Tamil films. His first Hindi film was \"Missiamma\"'s remake \"Miss Mary\" (1957), which became one of the biggest Indian hits of that year. He played the lead role in \"Devta\", the Hindi version of his own Tamil film \"Kanavaney Kankanda Deivam\". He also acted in the Ruritanian epic film \"Raj Tilak\" (1958), based on his own \"Vanjikottai Valiban\". It was a box office failure, having collapsed within a week of its release. He later appeared in a guest role in \"Nazrana\" (1961), the Hindi remake of his own \"Kalyana Parisu\". Though the film was an average grosser, it was the 12th highest-grossing film of the year.\n\nLater in his career, Ganesan switched to character roles, most notably the Telugu film \"Rudraveena\" (1988), its Tamil remake \"Unnal Mudiyum Thambi\" (1988), and \"Avvai Shanmughi\" (1996), in which he played the role of an old man longing for an old maid. Near the end of his acting career, he chose to act mainly in television serials, most notably \"Krishnadasi\". Ganesan also appeared in \"Mettukudi\" (1996), \"Kaalamellam Kadhal Vaazhga\" (1997), \"Thodarum\" (1998), and his last major role came the same year with \"Naam Iruvar Namakku Iruvar\", followed by special appearances in \"Gemini\" (2002) and \"Adi Thadi\" (2004).\n\nUnlike Sivaji Ganesan and M. G. Ramachandran, Gemini Ganesan was not originally a theatre actor, thus making his acting \"refreshingly credible\". Though he interacted cordially with fans, he avoided promoting fan clubs. Ganesan abstained from politics, to the point of refusing a Rajya Sabha MP offer by Rajiv Gandhi. The only time he even barely approached politics was in 1963, when he organised a function for Subramania Bharati at Ettayapuram. Apart from acting, Ganesan was also a businessman and invested heavily in real estate and property development. He was skilled in various sports such as tennis, golf, badminton, and captained his college's cricket team. Ganesan also directed the film \"Idhaya Malar\" (1976).\n\nGemini Ganesan has widely been praised for his versatility in acting, having performed a \"wide range of roles\". He was \"at his best\" with Savitri, with whom he had acted in several successful films. In February 2006, Dayanidhi Maran had released a commemorative postage stamp of the actor, who he described as a \"multi-dimensional personality, who evinced keen interest in Carnatic music, reading, yoga and poetry.\" He is also credited for having introduced leading Tamil actor Kamal Haasan to \"Kalathur Kannamma\", where the latter was a child artist. Ganesan also took part in a World Tamil Conference in Kuala Lumpur, notably because he \"loved Tamil language\". According to politician M. Karunanidhi, the actor had developed a \"reformer's mind\" because he was raised by his aunt Muthulakshmi Reddy, who fought for the abolition of the \"devadasi\" system. Director K. Balachander called Ganesan a \"director's delight\" and stated that \"The advantage of having him as a hero was that he was convinced about the capabilities of a director, he would leave it to the director and would not interfere\". Lyricist Vairamuthu said: \"'Gemini' Ganesan was not envious of anyone and promoted many actors by recommending them to producers and directors\".\n\nDespite being one of the most successful actors of Tamil cinema during his time, Gemini Ganesan was criticised for being \"fossilised in one type of portrayal\", as most of his films were typically \"boy meets girl\" romantic films. His hostile relationship with daughter Rekha was also criticised. He did not acknowledge Rekha's paternity during her childhood. It was in the early 1970s, when Rekha was looking for a career in Bollywood, that she revealed her origins. Later, at the peak of her career, Rekha told an interviewer that her father's neglect still rankled and that she had ignored his efforts at reconciliation. She did not even attend her father's funeral in 2005, and when asked about their relationship in a television interview, she did not answer.\n\nGemini Ganesan, at 19, married Alamelu, with whom he lived and whom he fondly called \"Boubji\". He later married Savitri while still married to his first wife. He had other affairs as well. Alamelu and Ganesan have four daughters; three of them – Revathi, Kamala and Jayalakshmi – are medical doctors, the fourth – Narayani – is a journalist with The Times of India. Ganesan has two daughters with Pushpavalli – Bollywood actress Rekha, and Radha. The latter acted in a few Tamil films, but then opted for marriage and migration to the United States. Savitri and Ganesan have two children: a daughter, Vijaya Chamundeswari, and Ganesan's only son, Satheesh Kumar. The actor noted in his autobiography \"Vaazhkai Padagu\": \"Somehow, I seemed to attract women who were in distress.\" He also felt annoyed by the title \"Kaadhal Mannan\" as it \"was used to brush him in black in his personal life\". He was survived by seven daughters and a son. Chamundeswari has a son Abhinay Vaddi, who acted in \"Ramanujan\" (2014), and is therefore Ganesan's grandson.\n\nA documentary film on the legend in the name of \"Kadhal Mannan\" was produced by Dr. Kamala Selvaraj and directed by Ashok Kumar, DFT (Programme Head-Vendhar TV) in 2011. It was screened to many film stalwarts and fans of the legend and received rave reviews from critics for bringing out a candid representation of the actor's life in detail. Following the response, a DVD version of the film was released in the same year.\nIn the mid-2010s, three films were made in reference to the actor. Odam Ilavarasu's romantic comedy \"Gemini Ganeshanum Suruli Raajanum\" (2017) began in 2015 and featured the lead character as someone who falls in love with several women at the same time. Muthukumar's \"Kaadhal Mannan\" (2018) was initially titled as \"Gemini Ganesan\", before the makers decided to change the title. Furthermore, an official biopic of actress Savitri was made by director Nag Ashwin in Telugu and Tamil as \"Mahanati\". Dulquer Salmaan was cast as Ganesan and revealed that his portrayal of Gemini Ganesan would go beyond just the physical resemblance and that the character's emotional side would also be depicted.\n\nAfter a prolonged illness caused by kidney failure and multiple organ failure, Gemini Ganesan died surrounded by Bobji and their daughters at his residence on 22 March 2005, 13:30 IST. He was cremated with full state honours. Prominent personalities including Tamil Nadu's chief ministers M. Karunanidhi and Jayalalitha paid their last respects to the veteran actor. Ganesan's funeral was not attended by his estranged daughter Rekha, who was then in Himachal Pradesh shooting a film.\n\n\n"}

The province existed for the duration of the United Kingdom, from 1815 to 1830, and for the first years after the Belgian independence, from 1830 to 1839. When King William I signed the Treaty of London in 1839, the province was split into a Belgian, and a Dutch part, the \"new\" Duchy of Limburg.\n\nThe territory of Limburg was the same as the combined territories of the present Dutch and Belgian provinces, with the exception of Voeren, which was a part of the province of Liège at the time. Its capital was Maastricht.\n\nFor legal matters, the province was subdivided into the arrondissements of Maastricht, Hasselt and Roermond.\n\nIn 1830, some 338,000 people lived in this province and in 1846, about 186,000 people were counted in the new, smaller province of Belgian Limburg.\n\nTheir main religion was, and still is, Roman Catholicism.\n\nFollowing the Napoleonic Era, the great powers, United Kingdom, Prussia, the Austrian Empire, the Russian Empire and France, created a new United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815. A new province was formed from the former French Empire département of Meuse-Inférieure, excluding Niederkrüchten and Herzogenrath which were assigned to Prussia, and was to receive the name \"Maastricht\", after its capital. The first king, William I, who did not want the name of the former Duchy of Limburg to be lost, insisted that the name be changed to \"Limburg\". As such, the name of the new province derived from the old duchy that had existed until 1795 within the triangle of Maastricht, Liège, and Aachen.\n\nAt the start of the Belgian Revolution of 1830, General Daine, the commander of the provincial armed forces of Limburg, situated in Maastricht, chose the side of the Belgian rebels. He left the city on 7 November 1830. He arrived at Roermond on 9 November and at Venlo on 11 November. Both cities welcomed him with open arms and sided with the rebellion. However, Maastricht was back under control by loyalist forces under the command of Colonel Dibbets.\n\nAlthough most of the province, including the fortress city of Venlo, at the time Belgium's northernmost fortress, was under Belgian control following Belgium's \"de facto\" independence after French intervention, the city of Maastricht remained in Dutch hands.\n\nIn 1839, King William I recognised the independence of Belgium by signing the Treaty of London. Under the terms of the treaty, the Belgians had to relinquish the eastern part of Limburg to the Netherlands.\n"}

On November 27, the Presidium of the Supreme Council of Karelia adopted a resolution on changing state symbols and on holding a competition for a new coat of arms, flag and anthem of Karelia. On December 15, 1991, a resolution was adopted by the Presidium of the Supreme Council on the conditions of the competition and on the composition of the competitive commission. It was supposed to hold a competition for the flag and coat of arms of the republic from February 1 to April 30, 1992.\n\nBy May 1992, 60 projects of the flag and 20 of the coat of arms were submitted to the competition commission. During this period, heated debates broke out in the republic about the flag - whether to keep the flag of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic or whether to return to the flag of the Ukhta Republic. As a result, after a few votes, the compromise version developed by the judge of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Karelia Alexander Ivanovich Kinner, relying on the idea of the 1953 flag of the Karelian-Finnish SSR, won the Supreme Council of the Republic.\n\nArticle 118 of the Constitution of the Karelian-Finnish SSR then stated: “The national flag of the Karelian-Finnish SSR is a cloth consisting of three horizontally arranged colored stripes: top, red, medium blue, making up one sixth of the flag’s width, and bottom, green, one fifth of the width of the flag”.\n\n\n"}

He played international cricket for India from 1987 until 1996 as a right-handed middle order batsman. He scored around four thousand runs in international cricket and occasionally doubled as a wicket-keeper. Following the conclusion of his cricket career, he now works as a cricket commentator.\n\nManjrekar was born in Mangalore in what was then Mysore State in southern India, on 12 July 1965, the son of Vijay Manjrekar, who made 55 Test match appearances for India between 1952 and 1965. As a schoolboy, he competed in the Cooch Behar Trophy between 1978 and 1982. He attended Bombay University, and played in the Vizzy Trophy and the Rohinton Baria Trophy between 1983 and 1985, winning both in 1985, with West Zone Universities and Bombay University respectively.\n\nManjrekar made his first-class cricket debut on 7 March 1985, scoring 57 runs in his only innings for Bombay during their Ranji Trophy quarter-final victory over Haryana. He retained his place for the semi-final, but did not play again after that until the following season. He performed steadily in 1985–86, averaging 42.40 with the bat, though his highest score was 51 not out. The following season, he struck his first century in first-class cricket, remaining 100 not out during the first innings of a match against Baroda. He scored one other hundred that season, and his season's average was 76.40. He struck a double century for West Zone in October 1987, scoring 278 runs from 376 before being run out.\n\nDomestically, he enjoyed success in the 1990–91 season, scoring four centuries and one half-century in eight first-class appearances. During the season, he scored his highest total, 377, in the Ranji Trophy semi-final against Hyderabad. He played in the final of the 1994–95 Ranji Trophy, scoring 224 runs to help Bombay to a total of 690/6 declared in their first innings, a total that saw them win the trophy.\n\nHe won a second Ranji Trophy final in 1996–97, captaining his team, by this stage renamed Mumbai. Manjrekar scored 78 runs in the match, in which both sides only batted one innings. Manjrekar kept playing domestic cricket until the end of the 1997–98 season, and had a batting average of 55.11 in first-class cricket, and 45.79 for List A cricket.\n\nIn late 1987, Manjrekar made his international debut, facing the West Indies in Delhi. He scored five runs in the first innings, and ten in the second, when he retired hurt. His first half-century in international cricket was made against New Zealand in December 1988, during a One Day International. Manjrekar scored 52 runs during a narrow victory for India. The following April, he scored his maiden Test cricket century, hitting 108 against the West Indies. He scored his second Test century in November 1989, against Pakistan. In the fourth innings of the match, he scored 113 not out to help India draw the match. In the third Test of the same series, Manjrekar made his highest score in Test cricket, reaching 218 runs in the first innings, before being run out. He did not score another international century for two years, when he hit 105 runs from 82 balls in an ODI against South Africa.\n\nManjrekar scored his final international century against Zimbabwe, in October 1992, reaching 104 in a drawn Test match. He continued to play for India until November 1996, making his final appearance in the first Test against South Africa.

He completed his international career with 2,043 Test runs, including four centuries, scored at 38.67, and 1,994 ODI runs at an average of 33.23.\n\nAfter retiring from professional cricket, Manjrekar began working as a cricket commentator.\n\nIn April 2017, while doing commentary in the IPL match of Mumbai Indians vs Kolkata Knight Riders, it was incorrectly alleged by Mumbai Indians player Kieron Pollard and erroneously reported by media that he called Pollard \"brainless\". Pollard took to Twitter and expressed anger over this remark. It was later clarified by Manjrekar that he had in fact used the word \"range,\" not \"brainless\".\n"}

A member of the revolutionary movement Katipunan, he was a commanding officer of the Philippine Revolutionary Army who served during the Philippine Revolution and Philippine–American War. He later served as a provincial Governor of Laguna and a member of the Philippine Legislature.\n\nCailles was born in Nasugbu, Batangas, to Hippolyte Cailles, from Lyon, France and María Kauppama of Kerala in what was then British India. He was the fifth of seven children together with siblings León, Julia, Isidoro, Julio, Victoria and Cecilia.\n\nHis early education was at the house of Olvidio Caballero and he graduated from the Jesuit-run Escuela Normal in Manila (now Ateneo de Manila University).\n\nHe became a teacher and taught for five years in the public schools of Amaya, Tanza and Rosario, Cavite.\n\nWhen the premature discovery of the Katipunan in Manila forced its \"Supremo\", Andrés Bonifacio to start the Philippine Revolution, Cailles organized a force composed of his pupils' fathers. To them, he remained \"Maestrong Cailles\" despite his successive promotions in military rank.\n\nHe took part in many encounters with the Spaniards, particularly in engagements resulting in the deaths of his superior officers, such General Candido Tria Tirona, Edilberto Evangelista, and Crispulo Aguinaldo, which caused his rapid promotion. With the Pact of Biak-na-Bato in 1899, hostilities ceased.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898, American forces arrived in the Philippines, defeating the Spanish at the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1, 1898, subsequently seizing the capital during the Battle of Manila of 1898. The Philippine–American War broke out in February 1899 with the 1899 Battle of Manila.\n\nCailles succeeded General Paciano Rizal as Laguna's military commander in July 1900 at the height of incisive attacks by the American forces. Cailles formed six military columns led by Lt. Col. Regino Diaz Relova (Pila, Laguna, Bay, Calauan and Los Banos), General Severino Taino (San Pedro, Binan, Santa Rosa, Cabuyao and Calamba), Lt. Canuto Aritao (Lumbang, Longos, San Antonio, Paete, Pakil and Pangil),Major Roman Dimayuga/Lt. Col. Pedro Caballes (Santa Cruz, Pagsanjan, Cavinti, Luisiana and Majayjay) Col. Julio Infante (Magdalena, Liliw, Rizal, Nagcarlan and San Pablo), and Lt. Col. Fidel Angeles (who died in the Battle of Mabitac) in Siniloan, Mabitac and Santa Maria (Gleeck, 1981, p. 4–5).\n\nOn September 17, 1900, Cailles' troops outmanoeuvred and routed a strong American contingent led by a Colonel Cheetham during the Battle of Mabitac in Laguna Province. Magnanimous in victory, Cailles allowed Cheetham to recover the bodies of eight slain Americans from the field, together with all their personal belongings.\n\nAfter serving as acting chief of operations in the first zone of Manila during the War, Cailles was appointed by Emilio Aguinaldo as military governor of Laguna and half of Tayabas (now Quezon Province). Aguinaldo's capture in Palanan, Isabela on March 23, 1901 convinced Cailles that the war was lost, leading to his own surrender to American troops on June 20.\n\nCailles then directed his efforts toward rebuilding the country. He served as governor of Laguna from 1901 to 1910, and again from 1916 to 1925. After his second term, he was appointed representative of the Mountain Province in the Philippine Legislature in 1925 and reappointed in 1928. In 1931, Cailles was again selected governor of Laguna, and reelected in 1934.\n\nIt was during his term as governor that the Sakdal uprising flared up on May 2, 1935, in Santa Rosa and Cabuyao, Laguna. The revolt was suppressed in record time, thanks to Cailles’ firm administration and revolutionary experience. Cailles had also a hand in the capture of Teodoro Asedillo, the \"Terror of the Sierra\".\n\nCailles died on June 28, 1951, a victim of a heart attack.\n\n"}

His highest ranking of world No. 13, achieved in July 2006, is a Finnish record. He has won two ATP singles titles and five doubles titles in his career. His best performances in Grand Slam tournaments have been reaching the quarterfinals of the 2005 US Open, the 2006 Wimbledon Championships, and the 2008 Australian Open.\n\nStatistically Finland's best player to date, Nieminen is also the first and so far only Finnish player to have won an ATP singles title and to have reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam singles event. He is also notable for winning the shortest recorded Masters Tour tennis match in Open Era history, defeating Bernard Tomic in just 28 minutes and 20 seconds in the first round of the 2014 Sony Open Tennis. He was ranked inside the Top 75 for 11 times in 14 years (2001 to 2014).\n\nOn 23 June 2015, he announced his retirement from professional tennis at the end of the season, playing 2015 Stockholm Open as his last event.\n\nHis wife, Anu Nieminen, is Finland's top-ranked badminton women's single player.\n\nOn April 2016, it was announced that Nieminen will compete in floorball in season 2016–2017 at Finnish Salibandyliiga representing SC Classic.\n\nAs a junior Nieminen reached as high as No. 9 in the world in 1999 (and No. 20 in doubles), and won the 1999 Jr US Open.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, Nieminen, who had already announced his retirement at the end of the season, played Lleyton Hewitt in the first round, with Hewitt also stating his intention to retire before the 2016 event.

Jarkko had match points in the second-set tiebreaker but narrowly missed one and was very unlucky to lose the other. Fellow Scandinavian tennis player Robin Söderling was in attendance to pay tribute to Jarkko and the Finn was visibly moved as he gave his farewell speech. His final official match was against his old friend and rival Roger Federer at the Hartwall Arena, Helsinki on the ninth of November.\n\nNieminen came out of retirement in order to play for his country at the Davis Cup against Zimbabwe.

Pepys was dining with his friend Sir George Downing on 9 November 1666, when the deaf servant had a conversation in sign language with his master, which included news of the Great Fire of London. Downing had been to school near Maidstone in Kent, where he lived in a community where congenital deafness was widespread. This population supported a sign language which was known by many hearing people as well as deaf.\n\nAs settlers of the Martha's Vineyard communities of Tisbury and Chilmark in Massachusetts migrated from the Kentish Weald, Nora Groce (1985) speculates that OKSL may be the origin of Martha's Vineyard Sign Language, which is, in turn, one of the precursors of American Sign Language (ASL).

It is sometimes referred to as the General Council of the Valleys (Catalan: \"Consell General de les Valls\") because it was the historical name and to distinguish it from similarly named bodies in the Val d'Aran and in France.\n\nThere are twenty-eight \"general councillors\", who are elected for four-year terms based on party lists in a closed list system:\nThe parish lists and the national list are independent of one another: the same person cannot appear on both the national list and on a parish list, and voters cast two separate ballots (there is no requirement to vote for the same party for both lists).\n\nThis is a recent development; originally, the seven parishes had each returned four deputies. However, as parishes varied in population from 350 to 2,500, this was felt to be significantly imbalanced, and the national list system was introduced for the 1997 elections to counter the disproportionate power held by the smallest parishes. \n\nThe Council appoints a presiding officer, titled the \"Síndic general\", and a deputy, the \"subsíndic\". The current \"Síndic general\" is Vicenç Mateu Zamora of the Democrats for Andorra.\n\nThe General Council (subject to approval of the Co-Princes) elects the Head of Government, who presides over the Executive Council. The Head of Government appoints the remaining seven members of the Executive Council. The current Head of Government, is Xavier Espot Zamora.\n\nPolitical parties are a recent innovation; the first party was formed in 1976, and they only gained legal recognition in 1992.\nThe most recent Andorran parliamentary election was April 2019.\n\nThe General Council has the second-highest proportion of women legislators (behind the lower house of the Rwandan legislature), and the highest in the developed world. In 2015, exactly half of its members (14 out of 28) were women.\n\nThe first parliament in Andorra was established in 1419, as the \"Consell de la Terra\". Councillors were elected by the population, and the council appointed \"syndics\" to manage the administration of the principality. It remained in force for several hundred years, slowly becoming the fiefdom of a few major families; this caused popular discontent by the nineteenth century, and major reforms were instituted in 1866.\n\nThe reforms were masterminded by Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit, and had several effects:\n\n\nIn the 1930s, matters again began to boil over; one point of particular contention was that the Council had begun regularly referring to Andorra as a republic, which understandably caused some contention with the co-princes. The General Council was dissolved on their order in June 1933, and a special election called to re-elect it. The opportunity was taken to change the voting laws; at this point, all men over twenty-five could vote, and all men over thirty stand for election.\n\nIn 1970, the vote was extended to women over twenty-five; in 1971 the qualifying age for all electors was lowered to twenty-one, and that of candidates to twenty-five. Women gained the right to run for office in 1973, and in 1978 a referendum was held on the matter of further reform.\n\nLater that year, a seventh parish (Escaldes-Engordany) was formed, bringing the numbers of councillors to twenty-eight.\n\nIn 1982, the Executive Council was created, comprising the Executive Council President and four councillors with ministerial duties. In 1984 Mercè Bonell was the first female Councilor.\n\n"}
{"id": "2056161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056161", "title": "Reliability trial", "text": "Reliability trial\n\nA reliability trial is an organised bicycle ride which challenges a cyclist to complete a course, passing through designated control points, within a preset time limit. In the United Kingdom, such events are often held in the wintry opening months of the year and are used by club cyclists as training rides. A common test would be a \"100 in 8\" – 100 miles would have to be completed within eight hours, including any stops.\n\nThe term is historic and dates back to the early years of the 20th century when cycling equipment was less reliable, roads were rougher, routes were more poorly sign-posted, and mobile telephones had yet to be invented. The name was also a way of emphasising to the police, at a time when the place of cycle sport on British roads was insecure, that the mass rides they might see were not races.\n\nReliability trial riders needed to be self-sufficient, adept at navigation, able to deal with mechanical problems, and fit enough to complete the course. In some cases, successful completion of the ride entitles the rider to a certificate. Reliability trials have lost much of their popularity although they remain a regular feature for sections, or clubs, of Cycling UK. The function of reliability trials as a test of fitness, reliability and the ability to ride long distances has largely passed to the similar randonneuring or Audax styles of riding.\n\nThe term \"reliability trial\" is also used to refer to motorsport events and are similar in concept. Rather like rallying, drivers and their vehicles (or riders and their motorcycles) must complete a designated course within a set time limit, without recourse to outside help along the way.\n\n"}
{"id": "2056167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056167", "title": "Andy Fraser", "text": "Andy Fraser\n\nAndrew McLan Fraser (3 July 1952 – 16 March 2015) was an English songwriter and bass guitarist whose career lasted over forty years, and includes two spells as a member of the rock band Free, which he helped found in 1968, aged 15.\n\nFraser was born in the Paddington area of Central London and started playing the piano at the age of five. He was trained classically until twelve, when he switched to guitar. By thirteen he was playing in East End, West Indian clubs and after being expelled from school in 1968 at the age of 15, enrolled at Hammersmith College of Further Education. There, another student, Sappho Korner, introduced him to her father, pioneering blues musician and radio broadcaster Alexis Korner, who became a father figure to him. Shortly thereafter, upon receiving a telephone call from John Mayall who was looking for a bass player, Korner suggested Fraser; still only 15, he was now in a professional band and earning £50 a week, although it ultimately turned out to be a brief tenure.\n\nKorner was also instrumental in Fraser's next move, to the influential band Free, which consisted of Paul Rodgers (vocals), Paul Kossoff (guitar) and Simon Kirke (drums). Fraser produced and co-wrote the song \"All Right Now\" with Rodgers, a No. 1 hit in over 20 territories and recognised by ASCAP in 1990 for garnering over 1,000,000 radio plays in the United States by late 1989. In October 2006, a BMI London Million-Air Award was given to Rodgers and Fraser to mark over 3 million radio and television plays of \"All Right Now\". Simon Kirke later recalled: \"'All Right Now' was created after a bad gig in Durham. We finished our show and walked off the stage to the sound of our own footsteps. The applause had died before I had even left the drum riser. It was obvious that we needed a rocker to close our shows. All of a sudden the inspiration struck Fraser and he started bopping around singing 'All Right Now'. He sat down and wrote it right there in the dressing room. It couldn’t have taken more than ten minutes.\"\n\nFraser also co-wrote two other hit singles for Free, \"My Brother Jake\" and \"The Stealer\". Free initially split in 1971, and Fraser formed a trio, Toby, with guitarist Adrian Fisher (later with Sparks), and drummer Stan Speake. Material was recorded but not released, and Fraser re-joined Free in December 1971. He left for the second time in June 1972.\n\nAfter leaving Free, Fraser formed Sharks with vocalist Snips (later Baker Gurvitz Army), guitarist Chris Spedding and drummer Marty Simon. Despite being well received by the critics, especially for Spedding's tasteful guitar work (Crawdaddy Lead Review, Bruce Malamut Vol. 27, 1973), Fraser left after their debut album, \"First Water\" (1973).\n\nHe then formed the Andy Fraser Band, a trio with Kim Turner on drums and Nick Judd on keyboards. They released two albums, \"Andy Fraser Band\" and \"In Your Eyes\", both in 1975, before that also folded. Attempts to form a band with Frankie Miller came to nothing, and Fraser relocated to California to concentrate on songwriting. He crafted hits for Robert Palmer, Joe Cocker, Chaka Khan, Rod Stewart and Paul Young.\n\nFraser's most famous compositions remain \"All Right Now\" and \"Every Kinda People\", which Robert Palmer recorded in 1978 for his \"Double Fun\" album.\n\nIn 1984, Fraser released another album of his own. \"Fine, Fine Line\" featured ex-Back Street Crawler drummer Tony Braunagel, Bob Marlette (keyboards), Michael Thompson (guitar) and David Faragher (bass), with Fraser contributing vocals. One of the songs on the album, \"Do You Love Me\" — a cover of the Berry Gordy Jr.-penned song — spent five weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 82 in March 1984.\n\nHaving been diagnosed with HIV, he was later diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma, a form of cancer that had been very rare until the onset of the AIDS epidemic. This time-line was called into question by Fraser's subsequent revelation that he was homosexual. He played bass with former Free colleague Paul Rodgers at Woodstock '94, but otherwise kept a low profile until 2005, when a new release, \"Naked and Finally Free\", appeared. At the time of the new album's release, Fraser was interviewed by Dmitry M. Epstein for the DME website and revealed: \"To be quite honest, I never thought of myself as a bass-player. I actually only used the bass-guitar because the other kids in our school-band wanted to be the singer, or drummer, or guitarist. I have always thought of myself as doing whatever was necessary to make the whole thing work. I’m happy adding piano, or tambourine, or anything that helped\".\n\nIn early 2006, writing for \"Vintage Guitar\" magazine, Tom Guerra conducted a comprehensive interview with Fraser, covering his career, influences and instruments and, in April, Fraser responded to the revival of interest in his music by announcing two rare live shows at Southern California's Temecula Community Arts Theatre on 4 May. The shows, accompanied by an eight-piece band, were his first live performances since the 1994 Woodstock reunion.\n\nIn 2008, he wrote and sang the song \"Obama (Yes We Can)\", to support the campaign to elect Barack Obama as president of the United States.\n\nFounded by Fraser, Mctrax International was incorporated as Mctrax International Corporation in California in 2005. Headquartered in southern California, Mctrax International and its subsidiaries MctraxMedia, MctraxMotion and MctraxStudios were originally created as an outlet for his prolific songwriting.\n\nIn May 2010, Fraser was interviewed for BBC Two's documentary series titled \"Rock 'n' Roll\". The project includes a five-part documentary, narrated by British music show anchor-man Mark Radcliffe plus online and radio content. \"The documentary aims to explain the success of some of the greatest bands of the past 50 years, including the Who, the Police, the Doors, Bon Jovi and the Foo Fighters\".\n\nIn mid-2013, Fraser played a supporting role as bassist in the band of protege Tobi Earnshaw for a short series of UK dates. Accompanying Tobi Earnshaw and Fraser was a veteran ally, guitarist Chris Spedding. Fraser produced and mentored Earnshaw on a number of album releases.\n\nFraser died on 16 March 2015 at his home in California of a heart attack caused by atherosclerosis. Fraser is survived by his daughters Hannah and Jasmine Fraser.\n\n"}

A former vice president of Intel Corporation, he is the inventor of the erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM) and the founder and first general manager of Intel Israel. He is also the author (with Robert Howard) of \"Leadership the Hard Way\" (Jossey-Bass, 2008).\n\nDov Frohman was born in March 1939 in Amsterdam, five months before the start of World War II. His parents were Abraham and Feijga Frohman, Polish Jews who had emigrated to the Netherlands in the early 1930s to escape rising anti-Semitism in Poland. In 1942, after the German invasion of the Low Countries and as the Nazi grip on Holland’s Jewish community tightened, his parents decided to give their child to acquaintances in the Dutch resistance who placed him with the Van Tilborghs, an orthodox Christian farming family that lived in the village of Sprang-Capelle in the region of North Brabant near the Belgian border. The Van Tilborghs hid Frohman for the duration of the war. His parents died in the Holocaust.\n\nLocated by relatives in Israel after the war, Frohman spent a few years in orphanages for Jewish children whose parents had died in the war, before emigrating to Israel in 1949 after the founding of the Jewish state. Adopted by relatives, he grew up in Tel Aviv and served in the Israeli army. In 1959, he enrolled at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology to study electrical engineering. After graduating from the Technion in 1963, Frohman traveled to the United States to study for his masters and Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley. After receiving his masters in 1965, he took a job in the R&D labs of Fairchild Semiconductor.\n\nIn 1969, after completing his Ph.D., he followed former Fairchild managers Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and Andrew Grove to Intel Corporation, which they had founded the previous year.\n\nIt was while troubleshooting a fault in an early Intel product that Frohman in 1970 developed the concept for the EPROM, the first non-volatile semiconductor memory that was both erasable and easily reprogrammable. At the time, there were two types of semiconductor memories. Random-access memory (RAM) chips were easy to program, but a chip would lose its charge (and the information encoded on the chip) when its power source was turned off. In industry parlance, RAM chips were \"volatile\". Read-only memory (ROM) chips, by contrast, were \"nonvolatile\"—that is, the information encoded in the chip was fixed and unchangeable. But the process for programming ROM memories was time-consuming and cumbersome. Typically, the data had to be “burned in” at the factory: physically embedded on the chip through a process called “masking” that generally took weeks to complete. And once programmed, the data in the ROM chip could not be altered.\n\nThe EPROM was nonvolatile and reprogrammable. It was the catalyst for innovations and developments that led to flash memory technology. The EPROM was also a key innovation in the personal computer industry. Intel founder Gordon Moore called it “as important in the development of the microcomputer industry as the microprocessor itself.” It remained Intel’s most profitable product well into the 1980s.\n\nAfter inventing the EPROM, Frohman left Intel to teach electrical engineering at the University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana. He returned to Intel in 1973, but his long-term vision was to return to Israel to create a center of high-tech research there. In 1974, he helped Intel establish a small chip design center in Haifa—Intel’s first outside the United States. On his return to Israel, Frohman taught at the School of Applied Sciences at Hebrew University of Jerusalem and worked as a consultant to Intel on the side. In 1985, after negotiations with the Israeli government on the establishment of a semiconductor plant in Jerusalem, Intel’s first outside the United States, he left Hebrew University to become general manager of Intel Israel.\n\nIn 1991, during the First Gulf War, when Iraq attacked Israel with Scud missiles, Frohman kept Intel Israel open despite recommendations from the Israel Civil Defense authority that all non-essential businesses close down. As a result, Intel Israel was one of the few businesses, and the only manufacturing business, in the country to remain open throughout the war. Frohman described his experience during the war in an article in the \"Harvard Business Review\".) In 1995, he led Intel’s efforts to establish a second semiconductor fab in Israel, in the town of Kiryat Gat in the south of Israel on the edge of the Negev Desert.\n\nToday, Intel Israel is the headquarters for the corporation’s global R&D for wireless technology. It developed the company’s Centrino mobile computing technology, which powers laptops, and advanced microprocessor products. It is also a major center for chip manufacture. In 2008, the company opened a second semiconductor fab in Kiryat Gat - a $3.5 billion investment, with seven thousand employees. In 2007, Intel Israel’s exports totaled $1.4 billion and represented roughly 8.5 percent of the total exports of Israel’s electronics and information industry.\n\nFrohman retired from Intel in 2001. \n\n\nHe is also a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities.\n\n"}

His musical style is one of jubilant praise and individual excellence on musical instruments. Although Kenoly himself only plays on one of his recordings, he leads comfortably with his voice and is always backed up by musicians and a large choir.\n\nHe holds several degrees, including a music degree from Alameda College, a Master of Divinity from Faith Bible College, and a Doctorate of Ministry in Sacred music from Friends International Christian University. His music career began following time spent in the United States Air Force. He was originally with a group called The Mellow Fellows, but family issues caused him to leave the group. His critical success came in 1992 when \"Lift Him Up\" became the fastest selling worship album to that point. \"Welcome Home\" produced by Tom Brooks was also critically acclaimed, becoming \"Billboard\"'s Top contemporary worship music album, and winning a Gospel Music Association Dove Award for \"Praise and Worship Album\" in 1997. He was signed to Integrity Music, but is no longer recording for them.\n\nHe began working in full-time ministry in 1985. He started out as a worship leader at Jubilee Christian Center in San Jose, California. Not long after that, in 1987, he was ordained and installed as Music Pastor. As worship leader, his sole focus was leading worship service. When he became music pastor, he became the shepherd over the entire music department at Jubilee Christian Center. In 1993, after the two Integrity recordings, he started receiving invitations from all over the world. Churches not only wanted him to come lead praise and worship, but also to help them develop their music departments. So shortly afterwards, he was named Ambassador of Music at Jubilee Christian Center. He was sent out from the church as an ambassador to the world to help churches develop and find the balance between worship and the Word. In 1996, he received his Doctorate in Ministry of Sacred Music. In 1999, he felt the call to move from California to the East Coast. So, he relocated the ministry to Central Florida where he continues to travel, speak, sing and teach and record. He sings all over the world. Kenoly has also written a few books, one of them written with his pastor, Dick Bernal.\n\nKenoly states that when his mother, Edith Kenoly, was pregnant with him, she would rub her stomach, and her prayer was, \"Lord let this one praise you.\"\n\nAfter graduating from high school in his birthplace, Coffeyville, Kansas, Kenoly ventured out to Hollywood, California. When plans to make it in the big city fell through, he joined the Air Force in 1965. It was in the military that he met and married Tavita, his wife of 42 years. It was also there that the humble beginnings of his music career were launched. Kenoly joined the Mellow Fellows, a top 40 cover band that toured military bases. In 1968, he left the Air Force and the Mellows Fellows behind and shipped out to the City of Angels to go after his passion: music.\n\n\"As a child I remember seeing Sammy Davis Jr. and Nat King Cole for the first time. I was so impressed as I watched two Black men grace a national stage. I knew right then that was what I wanted.\" So for the next few years, Kenoly poured all of his energy into making his childhood dream a reality. He sang demos of Jimmy Webb songs, like the 70's hit \"Up, Up and Away,\" for the Audio Arts label. The label also released Kenoly's first single, \"The Glory of Your Love (Mine Eyes Have Seen).\" Success in the R&B arena came after he signed with A&M Records. Under that label, he cranked out songs like, \"Soul Vaccination\".\n\nRon Kenoly and Candy were the first act signed to Semper's Inner City label. Their \"Lovely Weekend\" single was a massive success selling close to 200, 000 copies. \"The two of them came and sang the song at my house and I knew straight away I wanted to sign them,\" explains Semper. \"We recorded it at CBA (Clark Brown Audio) recording studio in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles in 1972.\n\nA&M Records boosted his success with R&B. The label executives changed his name to Ron Keith. He made R&B hits such as 'I Betcha I'll Get Ya', 'Soul Vaccination', and (in 1975) 'Can't Live Without You'.\n\nSome years later, he decided to drop R&B music and devote himself to a Christian life. He tried for four years to get a gospel record deal. In 1983, he released a custom-made album, 'You Ought to Listen to This\". It was a project known around Kenoly's community (not internationally released).\n\nKenoly eventually started leading praise and worship for other pastors such as Jack Hayford and Lester Sumrall. This caught the attention of Mario Murillo, who introduced him to Pastor Dick Bernal, the founder of Jubilee Christian Center. Ron Kenoly became the church's music minister in 1987.\n\n\nSongs written or co-written by Kenoly\n\n\nKenoly has five brothers (Mark Kenoly and Craig Kenoly) and three sons with his wife Tavita - Samuel, Ronald (referred as The Kenoly Brothers) and his oldest son Tony.

They are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, especially in the Mediterranean. \n\nNew World species formerly classified as \"Helianthemum\" have been transferred to genus \"Crocanthemum\".\n\nThese are usually shrubs or subshrubs, and some are herbaceous\nannuals or perennials. The leaves are oppositely arranged, but some plants may have alternately arranged leaves along the upper stems. The flowers are solitary or borne in an array of inflorescence types, such as panicles, racemes, or headlike clusters. The flower has three inner sepals and two smaller outer sepals. It has five petals usually in shades of yellow, orange, or pink. The style at the center is tipped with a large stigma. The fruit is a capsule containing many seeds.\n\n\"Helianthemum\" are known to form symbioses with mycorrhizal fungi. In the Mediterranean they are associated with Terfeziaceae, the desert truffles. Together, plant and fungus may have a beneficial effect on the arid local landscapes, preventing soil erosion and desertification. Some symbiotic pairs include \"Helianthemum salicifolium\" and the truffle \"Tirmania nivea\", and \"H. guttatum\" and \"T. pinoyi\".\n\nOne of the most commonly observed mycorrhizae on \"Helianthemum\" is a member of a different family, \"Cenococcum geophilum\". This fungus is not host-specific, and it often associates with oaks, as well. Some studies suggest that \"Helianthemum\" and oaks growing together in a habitat may \"share\" their mycorrhizae.\n\n\"Helianthemum\" are food plants for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, such as the large grizzled skipper and the silver-studded blue. The leaf miners \"Bucculatrix helianthemi\" and \"B. regaella\" both feed exclusively on \"Helianthemum sessiliflorum\", as does \"Coleophora eupreta\". \"C. ochrea\" is limited to \"Helianthemum\", and \"C. bilineella\" and \"C. potentillae\" have been observed on the genus.\n\nSeveral \"Helianthemum\" species, and the numerous hybrids and cultivars derived from them, are widely grown as ornamental plants, popular in rockeries. A broader range of colours is available among the cultivars, including bright salmon-pink to dark red. They are best grown in well-drained soil in full sun, and have a long flowering period from spring to summer. Numerous cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: \n\nSpecies include:\n\n\n"}

He is regarded by some as the first American anarchist (although Warren never used the term anarchism himself) and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, \"The Peaceful Revolutionist\", the first anarchist periodical published, an enterprise for which he built his own printing press, cast his own type, and made his own printing plates.\n\nWarren was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1798, a descendant of John Warren (1555–1613), the brother of \"Mayflower\" passenger Richard Warren. He showed an early talent for music and was a member of the \"Old Boston Brigade Band\" at an early age. In 1819 he married Caroline Cowing (1795–1872) and then moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he worked as a music teacher and orchestra leader. They had two children, Caroline (1820–1850) and George (1826–1902), and George wrote a remembrance of his father that can be found in the Labadie Library at the University of Michigan. He invented a tallow-burning lamp in 1821 and manufactured his invention for a number of years in Cincinnati.\n\nIn 1825, Warren became aware of the \"social system\" of Robert Owen and began to talk with others in Cincinnati about founding a communist colony. When this group failed to come to agreement about the form and goals of their proposed community, Warren \"sold his factory after only two years of operation, packed up his young family, and took his place as one of 900 or so Owenites who had decided to become part of the founding population of New Harmony, Indiana.\" The Cincinnati colony was attempted without Warren's involvement, but failed. Warren traveled by flat-boat from Cincinnati, arriving in New Harmony in early May, 1825. By 1827, he had returned to Cincinnati, convinced that the complete individualization of interests was necessary to cooperation. He considered Owen's experiment \"communism,\" which he rejected in no uncertain terms, but he developed a warm and lasting respect for Robert Owen and his sons. One of his earliest writings, published in \"The March of Mind\" in 1827, attests to this, as do later writings.\n\nHe put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental \"labor for labor store\" called the Cincinnati Time Store in downtown Cincinnati, which facilitated trade by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. This was the first store to use a labor-for-labor note. \"All the goods offered for sale in Warren's store were offered at the same price the merchant himself had paid for them, plus a small surcharge, in the neighborhood of 4 to 7 percent, to cover store overhead.\" Between 1827 and 1830, the store proved successful. Warren closed the store to pursue establishing colonies based on economic mutualism, including \"Utopia\" and \"Modern Times.\"\n\nModern Times, which was located in what is now Brentwood, New York, lasted from approximately 1851 to 1864. It was Josiah Warren's last attempt to put his ideas of Equitable Commerce and sovereignty of the individual, which he had developed over a lifetime of study and experimentation, into action. In 1850, Warren came back to Boston from the Midwest and began searching for an area near a major city, with low land prices, to establish a utopian community. The inexpensive land enabled Warren to be able to implement his plan to provide homes for families that had never owned one before. The Pine Barrens of long Island where Modern Times was located had an undeserved reputation as having poor soil so he was able to purchase 400 acres at $2.75 an acre with a very small down payment. Modern Times was a town with neither government nor money nor laws and can accurately be described as anarchistic, yet there was no crime and very little commotion. The citizens of Modern Times although eschewing the profit motive, were not socialistic in their attitude toward ownership of property or the means of production. According to author Roger Wunderlich, \"On 7 September 1864 the name of the village was changed to Brentwood.\"\n\nWarren later returned to the Boston area. From 1864 to 1869, he resided in Cliftondale, Massachusetts, where he twice attempted to establish a mutual town. He then moved back to Boston, where he remained until his death.\n\nWarren died on April 14, 1874, in Charlestown at the home of a friend after developing edema.\n\nLike Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Warren chose the path of anarchism and individualism. Benjamin Tucker dedicated his collection of essays, \"Instead of a Book\", to the memory of Warren, \"my friend and master ... whose teachings were my first source of light\". Tucker credits Warren with being \"the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism.\" John Stuart Mill said Warren's philosophy, \"though being a superficial resemblance to some of the project of the Socialists, is diametrically opposed to them in principle, since it recognizes no authority whatever in Society, over the individual, except to enforce equal freedom of development for all individuals.\" Warren's principle of the \"sovereignty of the individual\" was later taken up by Mill and Herbert Spencer.\n\nWarren's individualistic philosophy arose out of his rejection of Robert Owen's cooperative movement, of which he was an early participant, witnessing in person the failure of Owen's New Harmony commune. Of it, he wrote: \"It seemed that the difference of opinion, tastes, and purposes increased just in proportion to the demand for conformity ... It appeared that it was nature's own inherent law of diversity that had conquered us ... our 'united interests' were directly at war with the individualities of persons and circumstances and the instinct of self-preservation\". According to Warren, there should be absolutely no community of property; all property should be individualized, and \"those who advocated any type of communism with connected property, interests, and responsibilities were doomed to failure because of the individuality of the persons involved in such an experiment.\" Warren is notable for expounding the idea of \"sovereignty of the individual\".\n\nIn his \"Manifesto\", Warren writes:\n\nWarren said that Stephen Pearl Andrews' \"The Science of Society\", published in 1852, was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories including Warren's belief that employers should pay their employees the full value of their labor according to the cost principle. Warren's theory of value places him within the tradition of free-market socialism. William Bailie states:\n\nThe outcome of Warren's theory of value, of Cost the Limit of Price, was to place him squarely in line with the cardinal doctrine of all other schools of modern socialism. He believed that labor was robbed through rent, interest, and profit and his aim, like that of the Socialists, was to prevent these modes of exploitation.\n\nWarren termed the phrase \"cost the limit of price,\" with \"cost\" here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item. This understanding of cost is congruent with that of the classical economist Adam Smith who said \"The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it,\" though Warren reached different conclusions. He believed that goods and services should trade according to how much labor was exerted to produce them and bring them to market, instead of according to how individuals believed them to be subjectively worth. Therefore, he \"proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce.\" To charge more labor for something that entailed less labor was \"cannibalism,\" according to him. Moreover, he believed that trading according to \"cost the limit of price\" would promote increasing efficiency in an economy, as he explains in \"Equitable Commerce\":\n\nCatalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the intentional communal experiments pioneered by Warren were influential in European individualist anarchists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries such as Émile Armand and the intentional communities started by them.\n\n\n"}

During his ten-year career in that post he helped to make the LYR one of the most efficient railways in the United Kingdom, by designing a range of good locomotives to haul the LYR's traffic.\n\nBarton Wright was born on 13 November 1828 at Murton House, near North Shields, Northumberland. His father was William Clark Wright, and his maternal grandmother was Althea Barton, a member of the Manchester merchant family. The Barton Wright family lived in Bayswater, London from 1839; Barton Wright's father died there in 1844.\n\nBarton Wright became an apprentice at the Swindon Works of the Great Western Railway (GWR) at the age of 17, under Daniel Gooch. There he served in the erecting shop, and then the drawing office, before becoming assistant to Archibald Sturrock, the works manager. Having completed his apprenticeship in 1851, he was given the charge of the GWR's locomotive depot at Paddington.\n\nIn October 1854, he was appointed the first locomotive, carriage and wagon superintendent of the Madras Railway, taking up his post in March 1855. Locomotives supplied to the Madras Railway during this period were to the specification of John Hawkshaw; mostly 2-4-0 for passenger trains, 0-4-2 for mixed traffic, and 0-6-0 for goods. Barton Wright married Janet Forlonge, daughter of the Australian pioneer William Forlonge, in 1858, whilst on leave in England. They had six sons and three daughters. Barton Wright became a Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 7 December 1869, and a Member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in June 1878.\n\nThe Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) was formed by amalgamation of several railways, some of which had their own locomotive repairing facilities. Following amalgamation, it took some time for these establishments to be consolidated, and the number of departmental heads reduced. For example, the Manchester and Bolton Railway had amalgamated in 1846 but its locomotives remained separate until Salford works was closed in 1849, when the work was transferred to the former Manchester and Leeds Railway workshops at Miles Platting. In 1875, the facilities at Miles Platting were under the charge of William Hurst and William Yates, who were appointed outdoor superintendent and indoor superintendent respectively on 22 January 1868, both being in succession to William Jenkins. The locomotives of the former East Lancashire Railway were repaired at Bury, and were also the responsibility of two men: John Jacques, who was appointed outdoor superintendent on 24 April 1865, and George Roberts, who had been appointed indoor superintendent following the death of R. Mason on 15 October 1873. Hurst was due to retire in 1875, and the LYR board decided to replace all four men by a single locomotive superintendent, and the post was advertised in August 1875. A short-list of six names was chosen, and interviewed on 27 October 1875. This reduced the six names to two: Alexander McDonnell, of the Great Southern and Western Railway in Ireland, and William Barton Wright, who had been working for the Madras Railway in India. Barton Wright was appointed chief locomotive superintendent from 1 November 1875, and the following day, Yates, Hurst, Jacques and Roberts were brought in and told that they would now report to Barton Wright. Hurst retired, whilst Yates and Roberts became works managers, at Miles Platting and Bury respectively. Jacques was given the opportunity to resign with six months salary.\n\nWhilst Barton Wright was at Miles Platting, he designed five new classes of locomotive: an 0-6-0 for goods work, very similar to some being built for the Taff Vale Railway (the Taff Vale Railway L class), was introduced in 1876; an 0-4-4T for local passenger services in 1877; a 4-4-0 for express passenger trains in 1880; and two types of 0-6-2T – one in 1880 with coupled wheels for goods and the second in 1881 with coupled wheels for local passenger services. Two of these, the 4-4-0 and the 0-6-0, were perpetuated by his successor, John Aspinall, with small modifications.\n\nThe demands of the locomotive maintenance schedule together with the restricted capacity at both Miles Platting and Bury meant that most of the new locomotives had to be bought from outside firms, and these included some that were not of Barton Wright's own design. In 1876, Sharp, Stewart & Co. were building a batch of thirty 0-4-2 locomotives for the Great Northern Railway (GNR), to the design of Patrick Stirling, the GNR locomotive superintendent; but after twelve had been delivered to the GNR, the next eight were sold (with the permission of the GNR) directly to the LYR instead, where they became the 605 class; and Sharp, Stewart subsequently supplied the GNR with the last ten of their original order, plus a further eight to make up the shortfall. On the GNR, they were intended for mixed-traffic duties (and later formed Class F2), but the LYR mainly used them on express passenger trains. There were also several small 0-4-0ST for shunting, of various types, bought between 1882 and 1885. Barton Wright also rebuilt some of the locomotives of his predecessors, giving them a longer life.\n\nThe situation at Miles Platting was eased once the new carriage works at Newton Heath was opened in 1877, which allowed the locomotive department to take over the space at Miles Platting formerly occupied by the carriage and wagon department, which itself had largely been destroyed by fire on 27 April 1873 and rebuilt later that year. Following this expansion, it was possible to build additional locomotives at Miles Platting, and forty of the 528 class were built during 1878–81, but these were the last new locomotives built there. Space was still tight, and there was no room to expand the works any further, since the surrounding area was fully occupied with other buildings, including houses. In 1883, John Ramsbottom, the former locomotive superintendent of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), was engaged by the LYR as \"Consulting Engineer in matters relating to the Locomotive Department\" and toured the whole LYR system with Barton Wright, looking at all the repair facilities. Ramsbottom gave his advice to the LYR Board on 19 March 1884, and it was decided to build a new locomotive works in open country, where expansion would be easier. Various potential sites were examined by Ramsbottom and Barton Wright, and at a meeting on 21 May, they were informed by Elias Dorning, the LYR land agent, of an estate of at Horwich. Ramsbottom, Dorning and Barton Wright went to examine the land, and having reported back to the Board, Dorning was authorised to purchase it for not more than £65,000. At an auction on 27 May 1884 he bought the land for £36,000. Together with Ramsbottom, Barton Wright began planning the new locomotive works, and construction began the following year. But before Horwich Works was ready to begin construction and repair of locomotives, Barton Wright tendered his resignation on 23 June 1886. Aspinall was appointed to succeed Barton Wright on 14 July 1886, with the new title of Chief Mechanical Engineer (a title which had previously been held by only one other person, Francis William Webb, Ramsbottom's successor on the LNWR). Locomotive repair at Horwich began on 15 November 1886; new construction commenced in January 1888, and the first new locomotive was delivered on 20 February 1889.\n\nHe then went into private practice as an engineer in London, and became a director of the Assam Railways and Trading Co. He acquired tea estates including the Balmadies and Bitherookardu estates in the Nilgiri Hills in Southern India, later managed by his sons. Following the death of his wife in 1892, he retired to Dover, moving to St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex in 1907, where he died on 7 May 1915 at the age of 86.\n\nThe forty 0-6-0s of the 528 class built in 1878–81 were the last locomotives to be built at the LYR's locomotive works at Miles Platting.\n\nHis son Edward William Barton-Wright was a pioneering promoter of Asian martial arts in the Western world: see \"Bartitsu\".\n\n\n"}

He is credited with founding the study of law as a systematic discipline. He was elected Pontifex Maximus (chief priest of Rome), as had been his father and uncle before him. He was the first Roman Pontifex Maximus to be murdered publicly, in Rome in the very Temple of the Vestal Virgins, signifying a breakdown of historical norms and religious taboos in the Republic.\n\nScaevola was elected tribune in 106 BC, aedile in 104 BC and consul in 95 BC. As consul, together with his relative Lucius Licinius Crassus he had a law (the \"Lex Licinia Mucia\") passed in the Senate that denied Roman citizenship to certain groups within the Roman sphere of influence (\"Italians\" and \"Latins\"). The passage of this law was one of the major contributing factors to the Social War.\n\nScaevola was next made governor of Asia, a position in which he became renowned for his harsh treatment of corrupt tax collectors, and for publishing an edict that later became a standard model for provincial administration. Cicero, for instance, modelled his governor's edict for Cilicia on Scaevola's example. Scaevola's honest administration was so successful that the people he governed instituted a festival day (the \"dies Mucia\") in his honour. This festival was in turn so popular that even Mithridates VI of Pontus left it untouched when he invaded Asia in the First Mithridatic War.\n\nHowever, by governing Asia so fairly, Scaevola and his legate Publius Rutilius Rufus attracted the enmity of the Equites, who were being denied their usual profits from extorting the locals. These equestrian businessmen later conspired to have Rutilius Rufus prosecuted and exiled for the charge of extortion in 92 BC, a trial that became a byword for injustice in later generations of Romans. \n\nReturning to Rome, Scaevola was elected pontifex maximus. He took the opportunity to more strictly regulate the priestly colleges and to ensure that traditional rituals were properly observed.\n\nScaevola was the author of a treatise on civil law (\"Jus civile primus constituit generatim in libros decem et octo redigendo\") that spanned 18 volumes, compiling and systematising legislation and precedents. He also wrote a short legal handbook (ο̉ροι, or simply \"Liber Singularis\") containing a glossary of terms and an outline of basic principles. Four short sections of this latter work were incorporated by Justinian I into his \"Pandectae\", but nothing of the rest of his works is extant today. Speeches by Scaevola extant in ancient times were praised by Cicero.\n\nHe was also the originator of cautelary law giving his name to the cautio muciana and the praesumptio muciana.\n\nScaevola was killed in the civil unrest surrounding the power struggle between Sulla and Gaius Marius. At the latter's funeral in 86 BC, an attempt was made on his life at the instigation of Flavius Fimbria, one of Marius's most violent partisans, who, upon hearing that the victim survived, albeit with a severe wound, launched a prosecution against him, on the grounds that the priest had not allowed the blade to be fully thrust onto his body. Scaevola's loyalty to the Marian party was sufficiently in doubt that, in 82 BC, Marius's son ordered the praetor in Rome, Damasippus, to convene the Senate on some pretext, to murder the priest and other unreliable senators in the senate house itself. Once Scaevola realized the ploy, he fled to the temple of Vesta where, at the vestibule, he was butchered by assassins. His corpse was thrown unburied into the Tiber.\n\nScaevola was the son of Publius Mucius Scaevola, who was consul in 133 BC and also Pontifex Maximus.\n\nScaevola was married twice, both women were named Licinia. By his first wife, who was noted for her beauty, but whom he divorced after her adultery with another ex-consul, he had a daughter Mucia Tertia; she was married to Pompey the Great, with whom she had his three surviving children. By his granddaughter Pompeia (wife of Faustus Cornelius Sulla, eldest surviving son of the Dictator), Scaevola had illustrious descendants living well into the first and possibly second century of this era.\n\n"}
{"id": "2056222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056222", "title": "Offer and acceptance", "text": "Offer and acceptance\n\nOffer and acceptance analysis is a traditional approach in contract law. The offer and acceptance formula, developed in the 19th century, identifies a moment of formation when the parties are of one mind. This classical approach to contract formation has been modified by developments in the law of estoppel, misleading conduct, misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, and power of acceptance.\nTreitel defines an offer as \"an expression of willingness to contract on certain terms, made with the intention that it shall become binding as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it is addressed\", the \"offeree\". An offer is a statement of the terms on which the offeror is willing to be bound. It is the present contractual intent to be bound by a contract with definite and certain terms communicated to the offeree.\n\nThe expression of an offer may take different forms and which form is acceptable varies by jurisdiction. Offers may be presented in a letter, newspaper advertisement, fax, email verbally or even conduct, as long as it communicates the basis on which the offeror is prepared to contract.\n\nWhether the two parties have reached agreement on the terms or whether a valid offer has been made is an issue which is determined by the applicable law. In certain jurisdictions, courts use criteria known as 'the objective test' which was explained in the leading English case of \"Smith v. Hughes\". In Smith v. Hughes, the court emphasised that the important thing in determining whether there has been a valid offer is not the party's own (subjective) intentions, but how a reasonable person would view the situation. The objective test is largely superseded in the UK since the introduction of the Brussels Regime in combination with the Rome I Regulation. \n\nAn offer can only be the basis of a binding contract if it contains the key terms of the contract. For example, as a minimum requirement for sale of goods contracts, a valid offer must include at least the following 4 terms: Delivery date, price, terms of payment that includes the date of payment and detail description of the item on offer including a fair description of the condition or type of service. Unless the minimum requirements are met, an offer of sale is not classified by the courts as a legal offer but is instead seen as an advertisement. Under Dutch law an advertisement is in most cases an invitation to make an offer, rather than an offer. \n\nA unilateral contract is created when someone offers to do something \"in return for\" the performance of the act stipulated in the offer. In this regard, acceptance does not have to be communicated and can be accepted through conduct by performing the act. Nonetheless, the person performing the act must do it in reliance on the offer.\n\nA unilateral contract can be contrasted with a bilateral contract, where there is an exchange of promises between two parties. For example, when (A) promises to sell her car and (B) promises to buy the car.\n\nThe formation of a unilateral contract can be demonstrated in the English case \"Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co\". In order to guarantee the effectiveness of the Smoke Ball remedy, the company offered a reward of 100 pounds to anyone who used the remedy and contracted the flu. Once aware of the offer, Carlill accepted the offer when she purchased the Smoke Ball remedy and completed the prescribed course. Upon contracting the flu, she became eligible for the reward. Therefore, the company's offer to pay 100 pounds \"in return for\" the use of the Smoke Ball remedy and guarantee not to contract the flu was performed by Carlill.\n\nAn invitation to treat is not an offer, but an indication of a person's willingness to negotiate a contract. It's a pre-offer communication. In the UK case \"Harvey v. Facey\", an indication by the owner of property that he or she might be interested in selling at a certain price, for example, has been regarded as an invitation to treat. Similarly in the English case \"Gibson v Manchester City Council\" the words \"may be prepared to sell\" were held to be a notification of price and therefore not a distinct offer, though in another case concerning the same change of policy (Manchester City Council underwent a change of political control and stopped the sale of council houses to their tenants) \"Storer v. Manchester City Council\", the court held that an agreement was completed by the tenant's signing and returning the agreement to purchase, as the language of the agreement had been sufficiently explicit and the signature on behalf of the council a mere formality to be completed. Statements of invitation are only intended to solicit offers from people and are not intended to result in any immediate binding obligation. \nThe courts have tended to take a consistent approach to the identification of invitations to treat, as compared with offer and acceptance, in common transactions. The display of goods for sale, whether in a shop window or on the shelves of a self-service store, is ordinarily treated as an invitation to treat and not an offer.\n\nThe holding of a public auction will also usually be regarded as an invitation to treat. Auctions are, however, a special case generally. The rule is that the bidder is making an offer to buy and the auctioneer accepts this in whatever manner is customary, usually the fall of the hammer. A bidder may withdraw his or her bid at any time before the fall of the hammer, but any bid in any event lapses as an offer on the making of a higher bid, so that if a higher bid is made, then withdrawn before the fall of the hammer, the auctioneer cannot then purport to accept the previous highest bid. If an auction is without reserve then, whilst there is no contract of sale between the owner of the goods and the highest bidder (because the placing of goods in the auction is an invitation to treat), there is a collateral contract between the auctioneer and the highest bidder that the auction will be held without reserve (i.e., that the highest bid, however low, will be accepted). The U.S. Uniform Commercial Code provides that in an auction without reserve the goods may not be withdrawn once they have been put up.\n\nAn offeror may revoke an offer before it has been accepted, but the revocation must be communicated to the offeree (although not necessarily by the offeror,). If the offer was made to the entire world, such as in Carlill's case, the revocation must take a form that is similar to the offer. However, an offer may not be revoked if it has been encapsulated in an option (see also option contract), or if it is a \"firm offer\" in which case it is irrevocable for the period specified by the offeror.\n\nIf the offer is one that leads to a unilateral contract, the offer generally cannot be revoked once the offeree has begun performance.\n\nA promise or act on the part of an offeree indicating a willingness to be bound by the terms and conditions contained in an offer. Also, the acknowledgment of the drawee that binds the drawee to the terms of a draft.\n\nFor the acceptance, the essential requirement is that the parties had each from a subjective perspective engaged in conduct manifesting their assent. Under this meeting of the minds theory of contract, a party could resist a claim of breach by proving that he had not be intended to be bound by the agreement, only if it appeared subjectively that he had so intended. This is unsatisfactory, as one party has no way to know another's undisclosed intentions. One party can only act upon what the other party reveals objectively (\"Lucy V Zehmer\", 196 Va 493 84 S.E. 2d 516) to be his intent. Hence, an actual meeting of the minds is not required. Indeed, it has been argued that the \"meeting of the minds\" idea is entirely a modern error: 19th century judges spoke of \"consensus ad idem\" which modern teachers have wrongly translated as \"meeting of minds\" but actually means \"agreement to the [same] thing\".\n\nThe requirement of an objective perspective is important in cases where a party claims that an offer was not accepted and seeks to take advantage of the performance of the other party. Here, we can apply the test of whether a reasonable bystander (a \"fly on the wall\") would have perceived that the party has impliedly accepted the offer by conduct.\n\n1.It must be an absolute and unqualified acceptance of all the terms of the offer: Sec.7(1).If there is any variation, even on an unimportant point, between the terms of the acceptance, there is no contract.\n\nThere are several rules dealing with the communication of acceptance:\n\nThe \"mirror image rule\" states that if you are to accept an offer, you must accept an offer \"exactly\", without modifications; if you change the offer in any way, this is a counter-offer that kills the original offer and the original offer cannot be accepted at a future time.\n\nHowever, a mere request for information about the terms of the offer is not a counter-offer and leaves the offer intact. It may be possible to draft an enquiry such that it adds to the terms of the contract while keeping the original offer alive.\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Sec. 2-207(1), a definite expression of acceptance or a written confirmation of an informal agreement may constitute a valid acceptance even if it states terms additional to or different from the offer or informal agreement. The additional or different terms are treated as proposals for addition into the contract under UCC Sec. 2-207(2). Between merchants, such terms become part of the contract unless:\n\nMaterial is defined as anything that may cause undue hardship/surprise, or is a significant element of the contract.\n\nIf there is no contract under 2-207(1), then under UCC Sec. 2-207(3), conduct by the parties that recognize there is a contract may be sufficient to establish a contract. The terms for this contract include only those that the parties agree on and the rest via gap fillers.\n\nOften when two companies deal with each other in the course of business, they will use standard form contracts. Often these standard forms contain terms which conflict (e.g. both parties include a liability waiver in their form). The 'battle of the forms' refers to the resulting legal dispute arising where both parties accept that a legally binding contract exists, but disagree about whose standard terms apply. Such disputes may be resolved by reference to the 'last document rule', i.e. whichever business sent the last document, or 'fired the last shot' (often the seller's delivery note) is held to have issued the final offer and the buyer's organisation is held to have accepted the offer by signing the delivery note or simply accepting and using the delivered goods.\n\nIn U.S. law, this principle is referred to as the last shot rule.\n\nUnder English law, the question was raised in \"Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corporation (England) Ltd\", as to which of the standard form contracts prevailed in the transaction. Lord Denning MR preferred the view that the documents were to be considered as a whole, and the important factor was finding the decisive document; on the other hand, Lawton and Bridge LJJ preferred traditional offer-acceptance analysis, and considered that the last counter-offer prior to the beginning of performance voided all preceding offers. The absence of any additional counter-offer or refusal by the other party is understood as an implied acceptance.\n\nIn \"Leicester Circuits Ltd. v. Coates Brothers plc\" (2002) and \"GHSP Incorporated v AB Electronic Ltd\" (2010) the English High Court has found that companies may have not agreed on any terms, and so the 'last document rule' may not apply. In the GHSP case, there was no situation where one company could have been said to have accepted the other's standard terms, as they remained in unresolved dispute. The court held that neither party's terms applied and therefore the contract was governed by the implied terms of the UK Sale of Goods Act 1979.\n\nAs a rule of convenience, if the offer is accepted by post, the contract comes into existence at the moment that the acceptance was posted. This rule only applies when, impliedly or explicitly, the parties have post in contemplation as a means of acceptance. It excludes contracts involving land, letters incorrectly addressed and instantaneous modes of communication. The relevance of this early 19th century rule to modern conditions, when many quicker means of communication are available has been questioned, but the rule remains good law for the time being.\n\nIn Australian law, there is a requirement that an acceptance is made in reliance or pursuance of an offer.\n\nAn offer can be terminated on the grounds of rejection by the offeree, that is if the offeree does not accept the terms of the offer or makes a counter-offer as referred to above.\n\nAlso, upon making an offer, an offeror may include the period in which the offer will be available. If the offeree fails to accept the offer within this specific period, then the offer will be deemed as terminated.\n\nGenerally death (or incapacity) of the offeror terminates the offer. This does not apply to option contracts.\n\nThe offer cannot be accepted if the offeree knows of the death of the offeror. In cases where the offeree accepts in ignorance of the death, the contract may still be valid, although this proposition depends on the nature of the offer. If the contract involves some characteristic personal to the offeror, the offer is destroyed by the death.\n\nAn offer is rendered invalid upon the death of the offeree.\n\nA contract will be formed (assuming the other requirements for a legally binding contract are met) when the parties give objective manifestation of an intent to form the contract.\n\nBecause offer and acceptance are necessarily intertwined, in California (US), offer and acceptance are analyzed together as subelements of a single element, known either as consent of the parties or mutual assent.\n\n"}

{"id": "2056235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056235", "title": "Television transmitter", "text": "Television transmitter\n\nA television transmitter is a transmitter that is used for terrestrial (over-the-air) television broadcasting. It is an electronic device that radiates radio waves that carry a video signal representing moving images, along with a synchronized audio channel, which is received by television receivers ('televisions' or 'TVs') belonging to a public audience, which display the image on a screen. A television transmitter, together with the broadcast studio which originates the content, is called a television station. Television transmitters must be licensed by governments, and are restricted to a certain frequency channel and power level. They transmit on frequency channels in the VHF and UHF bands. Since radio waves of these frequencies travel by line of sight, they are limited by the horizon to reception distances of 40-60 miles depending on the height of transmitter station.\n\nTelevision transmitters use one of two different technologies: \"analog\", in which the picture and sound are transmitted by analog signals modulated onto the radio carrier wave, and \"digital\" in which the picture and sound are transmitted by digital signals. The original television technology, analog television, began to be replaced in a transition beginning in 2006 in many countries with digital television (DTV) systems. These transmit pictures in a new format called HDTV (high definition television) which has higher resolution and a wider screen aspect ratio than analog. DTV makes more efficient use of scarce radio spectrum bandwidth, as several DTV channels can be transmitted in the same bandwidth as a single analog channel. In both analog and digital television, different countries use several incompatible modulation standards to add the video and audio signals to the radio carrier wave, \n\nThe principles of primarily analog systems are summarized as they are typically more complex than digital transmitters due to the multiplexing of VSB and FM modulation stages.\n\nThere are many types of transmitters depending on\n\n\nAn international plan by ITU (International Telecommunication Union) on broadcast standards which is usually known as Stockholm plan (1961) defines standards used in broadcasting. In this plan, most important figures for transmitters are radio frequency, frequency separation between aural and visual carriers and band width. \n\nThe audio (AF) input (or inputs in case of stereophonic broadcasting) is usually a signal with 15 kHz maximum bandwidth and 0 dBm maximum level. Preemphasis time constant is 50 μs. The signal after passing buffer stages is applied to a modulator, where it modulates an intermediate frequency carrier (IF). The modulation technique is usually frequency modulation (FM) with a typical maximum deviation of 50 kHz (for 1 kHz. input at 0 dBm level). \n\nThe video (VF) input is a composite video signal (video information with sync) of maximum 1 volt on 75 Ω impedance. (1 V limit is for luminance signal. Some operators may accept superimposed color signals slightly over 1 V.) After buffer and 1 V clipping circuits, the signal is applied to the modulator where it modulates an intermediate frequency signal (which is different from the one used for aural signal.) The modulator is an amplitude modulator which modulates the IF signal in a manner where 1 V VF corresponds to low level IF and 0 volt VF corresponds to high level IF. AM modulator produces two symmetrical side bands in the modulated signals. Thus, IF band width is two times the video band width. (i.e. if the VF bandwidth is 4.2 MHz, the IF bandwidth is 8.4 MHz.) However, the modulator is followed by a special filter known as Vestigal sideband (VSB) filter. This filter is used to suppress a portion of one side band, thus bandwidth is reduced. (Since both side bands contain identical information, this suppression doesn't cause a loss in information.) Although the suppression causes phase delay problems the VSB stage also includes correction circuits to equalise the phase.\n\nThe modulated signal is applied to a mixer (also known as frequency converter). Another input to the mixer which is usually produced in a crystal oven oscillator is known as subcarrier. The two outputs of the mixer are the sum and difference of two signals. Unwanted signal (usually the sum) is filtered out and the remaining signal is the radio frequency (RF) signal. Then the signal is applied to the amplifier stages. The number of series amplifiers depends on the required output power. The final stage is usually an amplifier consisting of many parallel power transistors. But in older transmitters tetrodes or klystrons are also utilized.\n\nIn modern solid-state VHF and UHF transmitters, LDMOS power transistors are the device of choice for the output stage, with the latest products employing 50V LDMOS devices for higher efficiency and power density. Even higher energy efficiency is possible using Envelope Tracking, which in the broadcast industry is often referred to as 'drain modulation'.\n\nThere are two methods:\n\n\nThe output power of the transmitter is defined as the power during sync pulse. (Real output power is variable depending on the content.) But the output power of the transmitting equipment and the output power of the antenna are two different quantities. The output power of the antenna is known as ERP which is actually the transmitter power times the antenna gain.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2056239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056239", "title": "Broadcast transmitter", "text": "Broadcast transmitter\n\nA broadcast transmitter is a transmitter used for broadcasting, an electronic device which radiates radio waves modulated with information content intended to be received by the general public. Examples are a radio broadcasting transmitter which transmits audio (sound) to broadcast radio receivers (radios) owned by the public, or a television transmitter, which transmits moving images (video) to television receivers (televisions). The term often includes the antenna which radiates the radio waves, and the building and facilities associated with the transmitter. A broadcasting station (radio station or television station) consists of a broadcast transmitter along with the production studio which originates the broadcasts. Broadcast transmitters must be licensed by governments, and are restricted to specific frequencies and power levels. Each transmitter is assigned a unique identifier consisting of a string of letters and numbers called a callsign, which must be used in all broadcasts.\nIn broadcasting and telecommunication, the part which contains the oscillator, modulator, and sometimes audio processor, is called the \"exciter\". Most transmitters use the heterodyne principle, so they also have frequency conversion units. Confusingly, the high-power amplifier which the exciter then feeds into is often called the \"transmitter\" by broadcast engineers. The final output is given as transmitter power output (TPO), although this is not what most stations are rated by.\n\nEffective radiated power (ERP) is used when calculating station coverage, even for most non-broadcast stations. It is the TPO, minus any attenuation or radiated loss in the line to the antenna, multiplied by the gain (magnification) which the antenna provides toward the horizon. This antenna gain is important, because achieving a desired signal strength without it would result in an enormous electric utility bill for the transmitter, and a prohibitively expensive transmitter. For most large stations in the VHF- and UHF-range, the transmitter power is no more than 20% of the ERP.\n\nFor VLF, LF, MF and HF the ERP is typically not determined separately. In most cases the transmission power found in lists of transmitters is the value for the output of the transmitter. This is only correct for omnidirectional aerials with a length of a quarter wavelength or shorter. For other aerial types there are gain factors, which can reach values until 50 for shortwave directional beams in the direction of maximum beam intensity.\n\nSince some authors take account of gain factors of aerials of transmitters for frequencies below 30 MHz and others not, there are often discrepancies of the values of transmitted powers.\n\nTransmitters are sometimes fed from a higher voltage level of the power supply grid than necessary in order to improve security of supply. For example, the Allouis, Konstantynow and Roumoules transmitters are fed from the high-voltage network (110 kV in Alouis and Konstantynow, 150 kV in Roumoules) even though a power supply from the medium-voltage level of the power grid (about 20 kV) would be able to deliver enough power.\n\nLow-power transmitters do not require special cooling equipment. Modern transmitters can be incredibly efficient, with efficiencies exceeding 98 percent. However, a broadcast transmitter with a megawatt power stage transferring 98% of that into the antenna can also be viewed as a 20 kilowatt electric heater.\n\nFor medium-power transmitters up to a several tens of kilowatts, including 50 kW AM and 20 kW FM, forced air cooling is generally used. At power levels above these some transmitters have the output stage cooled by a forced liquid cooling system analogous to an automobile cooling system. Since the coolant directly touches the high-voltage anodes of the tubes, only distilled, deionised water or a special dielectric coolant can be used in the cooling circuit. This high-purity coolant is in turn cooled by a heat exchanger, where the second cooling circuit can use water of ordinary quality because it is not in contact with energized parts. Very-high-power tubes of small physical size may use evaporative cooling by water in contact with the anode. The production of steam allows a high heat flow in a small space.\n\nThe high voltages used in high power transmitters (up to 40 kV) require extensive protection equipment. Also, transmitters are exposed to damage from lightning. Transmitters may be damaged if operated without an antenna, so protection circuits must detect the loss of the antenna and switch off the transmitter immediately. Tube-based transmitters must have power applied in the proper sequence, with the filament voltage applied before the anode voltage, otherwise the tubes can be damaged. The output stage must be monitored for standing waves, which indicate that generated power is not being radiated but instead is being reflected back into the transmitter.\n\nLightning protection is required between the transmitter and antenna. This consists of spark gaps and gas-filled surge arresters to limit the voltage that appears on the transmitter terminals. The control instrument that measures the voltage standing-wave ratio switches the transmitter off briefly if a higher voltage standing-wave ratio is detected after a lightning strike, as the reflections are probably due to lightning damage. If this does not succeed after several attempts, the antenna may be damaged and the transmitter should remain switched off. In some transmitting plants UV detectors are fitted in critical places, to switch off the transmitter if an arc is detected. The operating voltages, modulation factor, frequency and other transmitter parameters are monitored for protection and diagnostic purposes, and may be displayed locally and/or at a remote control room.\n\nA commercial transmitter site will usually have a control building to shelter the transmitter components and control devices. This is usually a purely functional building, which may contain apparatus for both radio and television transmitters. To reduce transmission line loss the transmitter building is usually immediately adjacent to the antenna for VHF and UHF sites, but for lower frequencies it may be desirable to have a distance of a few score or several hundred metres between the building and the antenna. Some transmitting towers have enclosures built into the tower to house radio relay link transmitters or other, relatively low-power transmitters. A few transmitter buildings may include limited broadcasting facilities to allow a station to use the building as a backup studio in case of incapacitation of the main facility.\n\nSince radio waves go over borders, international agreements control radio transmissions. In European countries like Germany, often the national Post Office is the regulating authority. In the United States, broadcast and industrial transmitters are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In Canada, technical aspects of broadcast and radio transmitters are controlled by Industry Canada, but broadcast content is regulated separately by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). In Australia transmitters, spectrum, and content are controlled by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) helps managing the radio-frequency spectrum internationally.\n\nAs in any costly project, the planning of a high power transmitter site requires great care. This begins with the location. A minimum distance, which depends on the transmitter frequency, transmitter power, and the design of the transmitting antennas, is required to protect people from the radio frequency energy. Antenna towers are often very tall and therefore flight paths must be evaluated. Sufficient electric power must be available for high power transmitters. Transmitters for long and medium wave require good grounding and soil of high electrical conductivity. Locations at the sea or in river valleys are ideal, but the flood danger must be considered. Transmitters for UHF are best on high mountains to improve the range (see radio propagation). The antenna pattern must be considered because it is costly to change the pattern of a long-wave or medium-wave antenna.\n\nTransmitting antennas for long and medium wave are usually implemented as a mast radiator. Similar antennas with smaller dimensions are used also for short wave transmitters, if these send in the round spray enterprise. For arranging radiation at free standing steel towers fastened planar arrays are used. Radio towers for UHF and TV transmitters can be implemented in principle as grounded constructions. Towers may be steel lattice masts or reinforced concrete towers with antennas mounted at the top. Some transmitting towers for UHF have high-altitude operating rooms and/or facilities such as restaurants and observation platforms, which are accessible by elevator. Such towers are usually called TV tower. For microwaves one frequently uses parabolic antennas. These can be set up for applications of radio relay links on transmitting towers for FM to special platforms. For example, large parabolic antennas ranging from 3 to 100 meters in diameter are necessary to pass on signals to television satellites and space vehicles. These plants, which can be used if necessary also as radio telescope, are established on free standing constructions, whereby there are also numerous special designs, like the radio telescope in Arecibo.\n\nJust as important as the planning of the construction and location of the transmitter is how its output fits in with existing transmissions. Two transmitters cannot broadcast on the same frequency in the same area as this would cause co-channel interference. For a good example of how the channel planners have dovetailed different transmitters' outputs, see Crystal Palace UHF TV channel allocations. This reference also provides a good example of a grouped transmitter, in this case an A group. That is, all of its output is within the bottom third of the UK UHF television broadcast band. The other two groups (B and C/D) utilise the middle and top third of the band, see graph. By replicating this grouping across the country (using different groups for adjacent transmitters), co-channel interference can be minimised, and in addition, those in marginal reception areas can use more efficient grouped receiving antennas. Unfortunately, in the UK, this carefully planned system has had to be compromised with the advent of digital broadcasting which (during the changeover period at least) requires yet more channel space, and consequently the additional digital broadcast channels cannot always be fitted within the transmitter's existing group. Thus many UK transmitters have become \"wideband\" with the consequent need for replacement of receiving antennas (see external links). Once the Digital Switch Over (DSO) occurs the plan is that most transmitters will revert to their original groups, source Ofcom July 2007.\n\nFurther complication arises when adjacent transmitters have to transmit on the same frequency and under these circumstances the broadcast radiation patterns are attenuated in the relevant direction(s). A good example of this is in the United Kingdom, where the Waltham transmitting station broadcasts at high power on the same frequencies as the Sandy Heath transmitting station's high power transmissions, with the two being only 50 miles apart. Thus Waltham's antenna array does not broadcast these two channels in the direction of Sandy Heath and vice versa.\n\nWhere a particular service needs to have wide coverage, this is usually achieved by using multiple transmitters at different locations. Usually, these transmitters will operate at different frequencies to avoid interference where coverage overlaps. Examples include national broadcasting networks and cellular networks. In the latter, frequency switching is automatically done by the receiver as necessary, in the former, manual retuning is more common (though the Radio Data System is an example of automatic frequency switching in broadcast networks). Another system for extending coverage using multiple transmitters is quasi-synchronous transmission, but this is rarely used nowadays.\n\nTransmitting stations are usually either classified as main stations or relay stations (also known as repeaters, translators or sometimes \"transposers\").\n\nMain stations are defined as those that generate their own modulated output signal from a baseband (unmodulated) input. Usually main stations operate at high power and cover large areas.\n\nRelay stations (translators) take an already modulated input signal, usually by direct reception of a parent station off the air, and simply rebroadcast it on another frequency. Usually relay stations operate at medium or low power, and are used to fill in pockets of poor reception within, or at the fringe of, the service area of a parent main station.\n\nNote that a main station may also take its input signal directly off-air from another station, however this signal would be fully demodulated to baseband first, processed, and then remodulated for transmission.\n\nSome cities in Europe, like Mühlacker, Ismaning, Langenberg, Kalundborg, Hörby and Allouis became famous as sites of powerful transmitters. For example, Goliath transmitter was a VLF transmitter of Nazi Germany's \"Kriegsmarine\" during World War II located near Kalbe an der Milde in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Some transmitting towers like the radio tower Berlin or the TV tower Stuttgart have become landmarks of cities. Many transmitting plants have very high radio towers that are masterpieces of engineering.\n\nHaving the tallest building in the world, the nation, the state/province/prefecture, city, etc., has often been considered something to brag about. Often, builders of high-rise buildings have used transmitter antennas to lay claim to having the tallest building. A historic example was the \"tallest building\" feud between the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building in New York, New York.\n\nSome towers have an observation deck accessible to tourists. An example is the Ostankino Tower in Moscow, which was completed in 1967 on the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution to demonstrate the technical abilities of the Soviet Union. As very tall radio towers of any construction type are prominent landmarks, requiring careful planning and construction, and high-power transmitters especially in the long- and medium-wave ranges can be received over long distances, such facilities were often mentioned in propaganda. Other examples were the Deutschlandsender Herzberg/Elster and the Warsaw Radio Mast.\n\nKVLY-TV's tower located near Blanchard, North Dakota was the tallest artificial structure in the world when it was completed in 1963. It was surpassed in 1974 by the Warszawa radio mast, but regained its title when the latter collapsed in 1991. It was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in early 2009, but the KVLY-TV mast is still the tallest transmitter.\n\n\n\n"}

They provide an essential oil that can be used as a stomachic. The dried leaves of the plant can be used in herbal medicines as an infusion to help with digestion and help stimulate appetite.\n\nMany strains of \"Astrantia\" have been selected for their value in the garden, where they grow well if given reasonable soil, some shade and moisture. Their unusual pincushion flowerheads provide summer colour in shades of red, pink and white. \"A. maxima\" 'Largest masterwort' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nA number of garden varieties have red flowers, e.g. A. carniolica 'Rubra'.\n\n"}

Founded in 1824, it is the oldest Catholic school in Australia and among the oldest schools in the country, currently catering for approximately 770 students from Year 3 to Year 12. The College is administered by the Catholic Education Office of the Archdiocese of Sydney and operates as a systemic school; attached to St Mary's Cathedral. The school is currently the responsibility of the Congregation of Christian Brothers and was the last school in Sydney to be served by Christian Brothers as both principal and deputy principal.\n\nSt Mary's Cathedral College was established in 1824 as an elementary school by the Rev. John Therry. The high school was established in 1828. It is the oldest Catholic school in Australia. St Mary's Cathedral College was conducted by the Christian Brothers and is administered by Sydney Catholic Schools, Eastern Region. The Christian Brothers association with the school dates back to 1911. Catholic education on the same site as St Mary's Cathedral has been continuous since 1824, except during the construction of the existing college buildings and the associated bishop's quarters (1987–1991). Schools on the site have been provided with staff by the Benedictine monks (1824–1882), the Marist Brothers (1883–1910), Sisters of Charity (1883–1967) and the Christian Brothers from 1910. The staff is now composed of Christian Brothers and lay staff.\n\nThe replacement of the Marist order by the Christian Brothers in 1911 was controversial. The Marist Brothers had complained to the Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal Patrick Francis Moran, about their working and living conditions. The cardinal ordered them to leave the college. He directed the Christian Brothers (under threat of interdict) to take over the college in their place, which they did. The cardinal then granted to the Christian Brothers the requests that the Marist Brothers had been denied. The College celebrated 100 years of Christian Brothers administration in 2011. Beginning in 2016, Michael Kelleher is the school principal alongside the assistant principal, Natalie Devenish.\n\nThe College supports a musical tradition, with close ties to the St Mary's Cathedral Choir, Sydney, and the cathedral liturgies. It also supports sporting sides in all CBSA sports and carnivals. Students at the college have the option to participate in debating, public speaking, mock trial, Duke of Edinburgh Award, and assisting at the Matthew Talbot Hostel in Woolloomooloo.\n\nThe school has a Fairtrade program through to Year 10. All students are encouraged to participate in altar serving at the Cathedral and to attend Wednesday morning Mass on a daily basis. Student leadership is of high regard at the college with 12 prefects from Year 12, including a captain and a vice-captain, who are allocated to ministry, administration, house & community and other areas. Additionally, each year group nominates four to five class captains from each different homeroom and two members of the Student Representative Council to represent the form throughout the college.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the Primeira Liga he represented Sporting as well, and also spent two years in Spain with Sporting de Gijón.\n\nThe recipient of nearly 50 caps for Portugal, Gomes represented the nation in one World Cup and one European Championship.\n\nShowing great ability since entering FC Porto's youth academy, Porto-born Gomes scored twice in his first-team debut against G.D. CUF, in 1974. Except for a brief La Liga stint with Sporting de Gijón, when most key players left the \"Estádio das Antas\" in support of director of football – later president – Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa, he was on all important moments of the rebirth of the club: the 20-year Primeira Liga drought end in the 1978–79 season, the first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final against Juventus F.C. in 1984 and, while he missed the 1987 final of the European Cup against FC Bayern Munich after breaking a leg days before, he scored five times in the side's victorious campaign, including the important second against FC Dynamo Kyiv in the semi-finals; he recovered still in time to play in the European Supercup against AFC Ajax and the Intercontinental Cup against Peñarol, on both occasions captaining the winner and scoring the opening goal in the latter game for a 2–1 win.\n\nIn addition, Gomes also won five leagues, three Portuguese Cups and three domestic supercups. Due to personality clashes with Porto's board of directors he signed with Sporting CP, ending his career in 1990–91 after still netting 22 goals in his final season and also helping the \"Lions\" to the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup, aged 34.\n\nGomes retired with Portuguese League totals of 404 matches and 318 goals. His nickname, \"Bi-bota\", was given after the two European Golden Boot awards he received, in 1983 and 1985. He remained the best goalscorer in the national territory for more than two decades only behind S.L. Benfica's Nené, and later returned to Porto, going on to work with the club in an ambassadorial role.\n\nFor the Portugal national team, Gomes scored 13 goals in 47 games from 9 March 1975 until 16 November 1988. His final appearance occurred against Luxembourg for the 1990 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, netting the only goal at the \"Estádio do Bessa\".\n\nGomes was part of the squads at both UEFA Euro 1984 and the 1986 World Cup, being one of the few players that did not defect the national side after the latter competition (following the infamous Saltillo Affair) and ending his international career two years later.\n\nWhile technically only a good player, Gomes' talent resided on a fantastic positional sense, which made him very dangerous inside the six-yard box.\n\nGomes once quoted: \"Scoring a goal is like having an orgasm.\" Benfica striker Nuno Gomes, who played in the 90s/2000s, chose that nickname in deference to him.\n\nPorto\n\n\n"}

He would not begin boxing as an amateur until a few years later.\nGlen \"The Road Warrior\" Johnson was a late bloomer of the sport, starting at 20 years old in Miami, Florida, at an emerging police boxing gym. Johnson compiled an amateur record of 35-5 and was a two-time Florida State Golden Gloves Champion, once at 165 and at the other at 178-pounds.\n\nJohnson won his first 32 professional fights before challenging Bernard Hopkins for the IBF middleweight title in 1997. Johnson was stopped on his feet in the 11th round. He added eight more to his tally of losses, many of them debatable decisions where Johnson was adjudged to have lost to the hometown fighter. He journeyed to England and suffered a controversial draw against Clinton Woods, but defeated him in a rematch by unanimous decision to win the IBF light heavyweight title.\n\nHis next fight came against former undisputed light heavyweight champion Roy Jones Jr., who entered following an upset loss to Antonio Tarver earlier that year. In another upset, Johnson knocked Jones out in the ninth round of their September 2004 fight.\n\nThe subsequent split decision victory over Antonio Tarver that December made him IBO and The Ring light heavyweight boxing champion. He was chosen the 2004 fighter of the year by the Boxing Writer's Association of America. Johnson lost the light heavyweight title to Antonio Tarver in the rematch.

The Redcliffe Dolphins were founded in 1947, accepted into the Brisbane Rugby League premiership in 1960, and since 1996 have played in the Queensland Cup. The Dolphins are one of the greatest survivors of rugby league in Australia, having being the most thriving Brisbane Rugby League team until the admission of NRL team, Brisbane Broncos which caused the decline of the BRL. The Redcliffe Dolphins have won the most Queensland Cup titles out of any other teams with 6 premierships and is considered one of the most successful rugby league clubs in Queensland.\n\nRedcliffe District Rugby League Football Club Inc. (known as Shellgrit) was founded on 27 February 1947, and in its first year entered Under 17, Reserve Grade and First Grade teams into the Sandgate Suburban Rugby League competition. Through the 1950s Redcliffe also played in the Kilcoy, Murrumba and Geraghty Cup competitions. On 19 November 1959 Redcliffe received full district club status and was accepted into the Brisbane First Grade competition.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, a number of famous players came through the ranks of the Dolphins to represent Queensland and Australia, including Trevor Harken and Arthur Beetson. Redcliffe won the Brisbane Rugby League Premiership for the first time in 1965.\n\nIn 1972 Redcliffe were coached by former Kangaroo Ken Day. Redcliffe's halfback Greg Oliphant was selected to go on the 1978 Kangaroo tour but did not play in any Test matches.\n\nAustralian national coach Frank Stanton coached Redcliffe in 1980.\n\nThe Redcliffe club won further premierships in 1994 and 1996 and has appeared in seven Queensland Cup grand finals, making it the most successful team in that competition.\n\nIn the 2000s a new National Rugby League team to be based on the Gold Coast was going to call itself the Gold Coast Dolphins. This was decided against after the Redcliffe Dolphins threatened legal action. The team was ultimately decided to be named the Gold Coast Titans. The Dolphins won the 2006 Queensland Cup, beating Toowoomba in the grand final at Suncorp Stadium under the coaching of Anthony Griffin.\nThe Redcliffe Dolphins have revealed that they have ambitious plans to join the NRL.

The Alan Moulder remix (previously released) is featured as the theme song for the UK version of \"\". It was first released on the \"Seven Days in the Sun\" single as a B-side. It was released as a single and was included on the UK version of the \"Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec\" soundtrack; it is a common misconception that \"pressure from fans\" was the reason.\n\nDespite having already appeared in the top 20 earlier in the year as a B-side, the single A-side release stayed in the UK top 20 for four weeks, peaking at number 12. It also peaked at number 47 in Ireland. It instantly became a regular to end the band's live sets, but has been occasionally rested from this position for a cover of \"Breed\" by Nirvana, while never used as one of the \"Feeder covers\" at Renegades gigs. \"Just a Day\" has sold over 100,000 downloads and physical copies combined, with an additional 100,000 sales-equivalent streams bringing this up to 200,000 domestic consumption figures, enabling it to be certified Silver in the process.\n\nFeeder's performance of \"Just a Day\" on \"\" in December 2001 was Feeder's last with Jon Lee. After filming for the performance wrapped, Lee left the studio premises on the back of a moped to travel to an airport, as he would spend Christmas and indeed his final days at his Miami home. This would be the last time frontman Grant Nicholas would see Lee. \n\nThe week Jon Lee died, the band were due to appear on \"Top of the Pops\" performing \"Can't Stand Losing You\", a cover of The Police which appears on CD1 of this EP. Their place was taken by Ash performing \"There's a Star\". Before the release of the single, Feeder had already appeared on \"Later... with Jools Holland\" for the first time. This would be the last time Jon would perform with the band in a live setting as \"CD:UK\" was not fully live, they ended the show with the aforementioned \"Can't Stand Losing You\".\n\nFeeder had already enjoyed a successful 2001 by the time \"Just a Day\" was released as a stand-alone single in December of that year. \"Buck Rogers\" had given them their first top 10 single and had then repeated the success with the attendant album \"Echo Park\".\n\n\"Just a Day\" stayed in the UK top 20 for four uninterrupted weeks and featured on \"Seven Days in the Sun\", as a B-side after being originally planned for their 1999 album \"Yesterday Went Too Soon\". It later was included on their 2006 compilation album \"The Singles\", making it the first time the radio edit version of the track was on an album. The song describes the loneliness of alcoholism and depression\n\nThe single was also released as an orange vinyl, with a Brian Serper mix of the main track as its A-side although the differences are hardly noticeable.\n\nThe single is especially notable as it was released as an EP, \"Just a Day E.P.\". This makes the release Feeder's sixth EP.\n\n\"Drowned in Sound\" rated the single 7/10, with reviewer James Westfox saying that although readers might dislike Feeder, the song is \"a difficult record to dislike.\" \"NME\" also reviewed the EP, although reviewer Christian Ward focused his attention on the B-side \"Can't Stand Losing You\". Sputnikmusic said that \"Just a Day\" was an \"almighty radio single\" and \"really worth having\".\n\nThe video shows various fans miming to the song in their bedrooms. It started off as a competition on the band's website, in which fans had to send in an unedited video of themselves and the director chose the best ones. After being notified that they were successful, they were then advised to refrain from posting on any public internet forum until the release of the video.\n\nDespite the mixed reception the video has within the fanbase (judging by the review on Feeder Fan Site), it gained cult classic status. It also became an inspiration to Jetplane Landing and Canadian rock band the Barenaked Ladies, for their videos to \"Brave Gravity\" and \"Wind it Up\" respectively.\n\nFans critical of the video often mention that the fans' voices singing over the track makes the video hard to enjoy. The idea of this was inspired by the idea of the song playing on a small 2-speaker tape player with the fan in question singing along to it.\n\nAlmost 19 years since the video’s original release, the band announced that after the reaction to the original video, they decided never to attempt such a video again. However, due to the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic, it was decided to invite fans to contribute towards a remake of the video to support front line workers during the said pandemic.\n\nTwo of the original cast returned and gained near to 200,000 views on YouTube within its first calendar week of uploading. The new version of the video, was also streamed live on the band’s YouTube channel with the selected participants videos not informed of before the premiere, unlike in 2001. This therefore meant having to watch the live stream.\n\n\nCD1\n\nCD2\n\n7\" vinyl (orange)\n"}

When it opened on May 22, 1978 it was fairly revolutionary in its exhibit design. The zoo, built in a suburbanizing rural area, had more space to house exhibits and was one of the first zoos to organize its animals by their living environment as opposed to their species. Exhibits are arrayed in six themed areas, including three themed walking trails ranging from one to two miles in length:\nThe Minnesota Zoo is a state agency. This differs from other zoos in Minnesota and most others in the United States, which are run by municipalities or private organizations. The Minnesota Zoo charges admission and sells annual memberships.\n\nIt is also home to a high school, the School of Environmental Studies.\n\nThe Medtronic Minnesota Trail features animals native to Minnesota. The trail, which had been nearly the same since it opened in 1978, was reopened in 2007 after a year-long renovation. The trail now features a \"north woods\" look and includes exhibits for raccoons, coyotes, and gray wolves together with long-time residents like beaver, otter, puma, and lynx. Smaller Minnesota animals, like turtles, frogs and salamanders are featured in the exhibit's “trailhead,” which is styled after a lodge. The quarter-mile trail takes guests through more than fifteen wildlife exhibits where they experience a variety of Minnesota landscapes, ranging from views into a beaver pond, a walk alongside a northern forest glade and a bird-watching perch in the treetops. The Minnesota Zoo received the Association of Zoos and Aquarium's (AZA) 2008 Significant Achievement Award for this trail. Animals in this area include:\n\n\nThe 3/4 mile Northern Trail lets visitors to animals found north of the 45th parallel. The Northern trail could also be seen from the zoo's monorail which was run year round, but permanently closed on Sept 2, 2013 as the trains were outdated and hard to find new parts for. Currently, the zoo is planning to convert the monorail track into an elevated Treetop Trail. Animals in this area include:\nPart of the Northern Trail is planned to be replaced by a future exhibit called Asian Highlands. The exhibit will be divided into two: Edge of the Himalayas and Mongolian Steppe. Edge Of the Himalayas will feature snow leopards, musk deer, tragopans, markhors, and red pandas. Food carts, sheltered seating areas and restrooms will be strewn throughout the area.\n\nThe Mongolian Steppe will be seen on the exhibit's north side. Pallas cats will be featured in a side exhibit while herds of Asian wild horses, camels, onagers and gazelles roam on a field behind the cats. A camel ride will take visitors along part of the exhibit.\n\nThe Tropics Trail is an indoor trail that gives the impression of being in a tropical rainforest. Animals in this area include:\n\nDiscovery Bay contains several aquariums with a combined of water. Guests have an opportunity to touch sharks, rays, sea stars and sea anemones in the interactive estuary and tide pool. At the entrance to the Tropics building, you can see the Wyland mural titled “Our Ocean Family,” dedicated on September 8, 1997. Animals in this area include:\n\nDolphins were exhibited at the zoo since its opening in 1978 until 2012. Hawaiian monk seals now reside in the dolphin tank. Director Lee Ehmke mentioned that in the future, perhaps a slim chance will come along that will allow the return of dolphins to the Minnesota Zoo.\n\nIn 1992, Rio gave birth to the zoo's first successful captive-born dolphin, a male named \"Shadow\" sired by Semo.\n\nIn March 2006, Rio died at 35. She came to the Minnesota Zoo from the New York Aquarium in 1980. Rio gave birth to four calves at the Minnesota Zoo. One of Rio's calves, 7 month old Harley, died earlier in January 2006 in a freak accident. He had been learning to swim between the pools when he jumped out of the water and hit his head on the deck between the pools. Another dolphin, \"Ayla\", who suffered from Scoliosis or curvature of the spine, was euthanized at age 14 in December 2006. She had stopped eating and stopped responding to her medication. At that time the remaining dolphins at the zoo were \"Spree,\" \"Chinook\" and \"Semo.\"\n\nIn 2007, the zoo shipped Chinook, a 24-year-old male, to the National Aquarium in Baltimore. Chinook was moved because the aquarium had seven adult females and no adult males. Chinook fathered a calf and then moved to the Brookfield Zoo in 2010.\n\nTwo females; Allie, and her mother, April were additions to the Minnesota Zoo's bottlenose dolphin family in 2008. Both arrived on January 14, 2008 from Dolphin Connection in Florida.\n\nIn September 2009, three bottlenose dolphins from the Brookfield Zoo arrived at the Discovery Bay habitat while their home stadium, the Seven Seas Dolphinarium, was being renovated. The three dolphins, Tapeko, and her daughters Noelani and Allison, remained in Minnesota for roughly six months until the tank in Brookfield was completed in the spring of 2010. This eventually brought the Minnesota Zoo's dolphin population up to 7. On April 15, 2010, Tapeko, Noelani, and Allison, made the return trip back to the Brookfield Zoo. Spree too was sent to Brookfield after it was decided she would have a better chance at acclimating herself to their social structure as she was generally outcast by Semo, April and Allie.\n\nSemo had impregnated Allie in mid 2008. However, Allie suffered a stillbirth on March 26, 2009, much to the disappointment of zoo staff. In November 2009, it was confirmed by ultrasound that Allie was pregnant yet again, by Semo this time as well. The female calf was born on July 17, 2010, and through a Facebook vote was named Tajiah in late 2010.\nBy January 2011, the pod consisted of 47-year-old Semo, 42-year-old April, her 23-year-old daughter Allie, and Allie's 6-month-old calf Taijah.\n\nDolphin shows at the zoo were put on hiatus in 2011. With Semo in his mid 40s, the zoo felt it was best for them to avoid the more high-energetic behaviors usually performed by the younger members of the group.\n\nOn February 15, 2011, April died and a necropsy was pending to determine cause of death. April was around 42 years old, making her one of the older bottlenose dolphins known in human care.\n\nOn February 6, 2012, Semo and Allie's 1 1/2 year old calf Tajiah died suddenly of complications from a stomach ulcer.\n\nIn all, a total of 19 dolphins have been housed at the zoo over the years: Semo, Flipper, April, Rio, Vince, Mindy, Chinook, Allie, Shadow, DJ, Ayla, Mindy's 1997 stillborn, Spree, Harley, Tapeko, Noelani, Allison, Allie's 2009 stillborn, and Taijah. As of 2013, Semo, Tapeko, Chinook, Allie, Shadow, Spree, Noelani, and Allison were still alive. Flipper, April, and Rio all surpassed the average expected lifespan of a bottlenose dolphin at approximately 38 years, 42 years, and 35 years respectively.\n\nOn May 14, 2012, the zoo announced that the dolphin exhibit would come to a permanent end come fall. The Minnesota Legislature had recently granted the zoo $4 million towards the renovation of the Discovery Bay dolphin tanks, which were in need of repairs. The zoo had originally intended to temporarily transport its two remaining bottlenose dolphins, Semo and Allie, to other zoos or parks until renovations were complete, but the decision was made to end the dolphin exhibit once Semo and Allie were shipped out.\n\nIt was unclear at the time where Semo and Allie would be shipped. It was assumed that because the Minnesota Zoo was part of the Dolphin Consortium (essentially a program that ensures genetic diversity among captive bottlenose dolphins), which consists of The Seas with Nemo and Friends at Epcot, the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Indianapolis Zoo, Dolphin Connection, Texas State Aquarium, and the Brookfield Zoo; one or the other were planned to be shipped to one of these locations. Semo's transfer was dubbed a \"retirement\". At nearly 50 years old, he was one of the oldest surviving male dolphins in human care.\n\nOn October 3, 2012, Semo and Allie were transferred out of the zoo. Semo was moved to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California, while Allie was sent back to the Brookfield Zoo just outside Chicago. Semo died on May 1, 2018, at Discovery Kingdom, of apparent natural causes.\n\nIn May, 2015, The Minnesota Zoo welcomed five critically endangered Hawaiian monk seals. The seals; \"Nani\", \"Koa\", \"Ola\", \"Paki\", and \"Opua\" are all female and were transferred to the zoo from SeaWorld San Antonio. All had been previously rescued after having been discovered malnourished and subsequently deemed unable to release in the wild. The seals will act as ambassadors to their critically endangered wild cousins as the zoo plans to offer daily, educational demonstrations with the seals in the newly upgraded \"Discovery Bay\" marine mammal tanks which housed the zoo's resident bottlenose dolphins up until 2012.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Family Farm, which opened in May 2000, allows guests to touch and interact with domestic animals. The Farm exhibit showcases goats, sheep, pigs, cows, chickens, and horses in a beautiful farm landscape. The Farm, a seasonal exhibit, is open every day beginning in April; the popular \"Farm Babies\" event marks the beginning each year. The Farm closes each fall for the season. The zoo has also created an interactive game about the farm called \"Who Pooped @ the Farm\". The farm also gives a chance for visitors to watch the staff milk the cows.\n\nRussia's Grizzly Coast gives visitors a chance to see animals that live around Russia's Pacific coast, including sea otters, grizzly bears, Amur tigers, Amur leopards, and wild boars in environments reminiscent of their homes in the Russian Far East. The , $23 million facility was the most expensive project to date at the zoo, and opened in June, 2008.\n\nOn July 9, 2011, the zoo premiered a new exhibit focused on African penguins.\n\nThe Great Clips IMAX Theatre is located on zoo grounds. At seven stories tall, as of 2014 it remains the largest IMAX theatre in Minnesota. It underwent a transition from analog to digital during the summer of 2014. In an email sent from the Minnesota Zoo to zoo members on January 18, 2019, it was announced that IMAX corporate will permanently close the facility on January 27, 2019. No reason was given. The zoo and IMAX had a partnership in which the zoo would show nature documentaries and IMAX would show mainstream movies.\n\nThere is also an outdoor amphitheater that is used for bird shows during summer zoo hours. After hours, the amphitheater is used for a popular \"Music in the Zoo\" series.\n\nOne of the first and perhaps most popular exhibits at the zoo was the beluga whale exhibit. The exhibit was home to two belugas, a male by the name of Anookalik (nicknamed \"Big Mouth\"), and a female by the name of Anana (nicknamed \"Little Girl\"). In later years, a bone infection was found within \"Big Mouth's\" jawbone (resulting from a collision with one of the tank fixtures) and forced immediate transfer of both whales to SeaWorld San Diego in the hopes of obtaining a more sophisticated means of veterinary treatment. In April 1987, a crowd of nearly 30,000 people filled the gates of the Minnesota Zoo to bid their final farewells to the two whales, who were transferred out of the zoo shortly thereafter. Little Girl died of heart failure on June 13, 1989, at the age of fourteen. Big Mouth, whose bone infection eventually proved to be fatal, was euthanized on July 16, 1990, at the age of seventeen.\n\nThe zoo also was home to a monorail from 1979 until it closed September 2, 2013.\n\nIn 1987, the zoo served as the filming location for \"All About Animals\", a title in the \"Little Schoolhouse\" series of educational children's videos.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2056346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056346", "title": "The Principal and the Pauper", "text": "The Principal and the Pauper\n\n\"The Principal and the Pauper\" is the second episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> ninth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 28, 1997. In the episode, Seymour Skinner begins to celebrate his twentieth anniversary as principal of Springfield Elementary School, when a man arrives claiming that Skinner has assumed his identity. Principal Skinner admits that his real name is Armin Tamzarian, and that he had thought the true Seymour Skinner, a friend from the Army, had died in the Vietnam War. Armin leaves Springfield, but is later persuaded to return as principal.\n\n\"The Principal and the Pauper\" was written by Ken Keeler and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It guest-starred Martin Sheen as the real Seymour Skinner. Although it aired during the show's ninth season, it was a holdover from season eight. \n\nThe episode is one of the most controversial episodes of \"The Simpsons\". Many fans and critics reacted extremely negatively to the revelation that Principal Skinner, a recurring character since the first season who had undergone much character development, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by series creator Matt Groening, and by Harry Shearer, who provides the voice of Principal Skinner.\n\nOn the eve of his twentieth anniversary as school principal, Seymour Skinner is lured by his mother to Springfield Elementary School for a surprise party. The celebration goes well until a strange man arrives, claiming to be the real Seymour Skinner. Principal Skinner admits that he is an impostor, and that his real name is Armin Tamzarian. Armin then tells the story of the events that led him to steal Seymour Skinner's identity.\n\nArmin was once a troubled young man from Capital City who enlisted in the Army in order to avoid a jail sentence for petty crimes. There, he met and befriended the real Sergeant Seymour Skinner, who became his mentor and helped him find meaning in his troubled life. Seymour told Armin that his dream was to become an elementary school principal after the war. Later, Seymour was declared missing and presumed dead. Armin took the news of the apparent death to Seymour's mother, Agnes. Upon meeting him, however, Agnes mistook him for her son, and Armin could not bear to deliver the message. He instead allowed Agnes to call him Seymour, and took over Seymour's life. Meanwhile, the real Seymour Skinner spent five years in a POW camp, then worked in a Chinese sweatshop for two decades until it was shut down by the United Nations.\n\nAfter these revelations, the people of Springfield begin to distrust Armin. Armin decides that there is no longer any place for him in Springfield. The real Skinner is then offered the chance to realize his dream and take over as school principal. He takes the job, but the real Skinner finds himself isolated by the townspeople, who realize they prefer Armin to him. Armin, however, has already left Springfield and gone to Capital City to resume his old persona as a no-good street thug.\n\nMarge heads to Capital City with Edna Krabappel, Agnes and the rest of the Simpson family. After Agnes orders Armin to return home, Homer persuades Mayor Quimby and all the other citizens to allow Armin to resume his assumed identity as Principal Skinner. The real Skinner is unhappy about this and refuses to give up his job and his dignity just because the people of Springfield prefer Armin to him. In response, the townspeople banish the real Skinner from town by tying him to a chair on a flatcar of a freight train (literally running him out of town on a rail). Judge Snyder declares that Armin will again be referred to as Seymour Skinner, that he will return to his job as school principal, and that no one shall ever again refer to Skinner or the fallout from his visit, under penalty of torture.\n\n\"The Principal and the Pauper\" was the last episode of \"The Simpsons\" written by Ken Keeler, who also pitched the original idea for the episode. Many fans believe the episode is based on the story of Martin Guerre or the 1993 film \"Sommersby\". According to animation director Steve Moore, one of the working titles for the episode was \"Skinnersby\". However, Keeler has said he was inspired by the Tichborne Case of nineteenth-century England. The episode's official title is a reference to the book \"The Prince and the Pauper\" by Mark Twain.\n\nProducers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were excited about the episode because Principal Skinner was one of their favorite characters. The pair had already written the season five episode \"Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song\", which was an in-depth study of the character. Oakley said he and Weinstein \"spent a month immersed in the mind of Seymour Skinner\" to prepare that episode, and from that point forward, took every opportunity to \"tinker with [Skinner's] personality and his backstory and his homelife\".\n\nDescribing the real Seymour Skinner, Keeler remarked, \"It would have been easy to make him a really horrible, nasty, dislikeable guy, but we didn't do that. We made him just not quite right, not quite Skinner, and a little bit off.\" Bill Oakley said the idea behind the character was that he \"just lacked pizzazz\". The producers selected Martin Sheen to voice the character because they admired his performance in \"Apocalypse Now\" and felt his voice would be appropriate for a Vietnam veteran.\n\nKeeler borrowed the name Armin Tamzarian from a claims adjuster who had assisted him after a car accident when he moved to Los Angeles. However, the real Tamzarian (now a California Superior Court Judge) was unaware his name was being used until after the episode aired. Keeler said he later received a \"curtly phrased\" letter from Tamzarian, who wanted to know why his name appeared in the episode. Keeler feared he would face legal troubles, but afterwards, Tamzarian explained that he was simply curious and did not intend to scare anyone.\n\n\"The Principal and the Pauper\" finished 41st in the United States in the ratings for the week of September 22–28, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 9.2. The episode was the second highest rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"King of the Hill\". The Fox network's ratings average for the week was 6.4.\n\nThe revelation that Principal Skinner was an impostor and the self-referential deus ex machina ending were negatively received by many fans and critics, with many seeing this episode responsible for the series as a whole jumping the shark. Skinner had been a recurring character since the first season and, after years of development, his backstory had suddenly been changed. Bill Oakley considers \"The Principal and the Pauper\" the most controversial episode from his tenure as executive producer.\n\nIn his 2004 book \"Planet Simpson\", Chris Turner describes \"The Principal and the Pauper\" as the \"broadcast that marked [the] abrupt plunge\" from \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> \"Golden Age\", which he says began in the middle of the show's third season. He calls the episode \"[one of] the weakest episodes in \"Simpsons\" history\", and adds, \"A blatant, continuity-scrambling plot twist of this sort might've been forgivable if the result had been as funny or sharply satirical as the classics of the Golden Age, but alas it's emphatically not.\" Turner notes that the episode \"still sports a couple of virtuoso gags\", but says that such moments are limited.\n\nIn July 2007, in an article in \"The Guardian\", Ian Jones argues that the \"show became stupid\" in 1997, pointing to \"The Principal and the Pauper\" as the bellwether. \"Come again? A major character in a long-running series gets unmasked as a fraud? It was cheap, idle storytelling\", he remarks.\n\nIn a February 2006 article in \"The Star-Ledger\", Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz cite the episode when asserting that the quality of \"The Simpsons\" \"gets much spottier\" in season nine. Alan Sepinwall observes in another \"Star-Ledger\" article, \"[The episode] was so implausible that even the characters were disavowing it by the end of the episode.\" Jon Hein, who coined the term \"jumping the shark\" to refer to negative changes in television series, writes in \"Jump the Shark: TV Edition\", \"We finally spotted a fin at the start of the ninth season when Principal Skinner's true identity was revealed as Armin Tamzarian.\" James Greene of \"Nerve.com\" put the episode fifth on his list \"Ten Times The Simpsons Jumped the Shark\", calling it a \"nonsensical meta-comedy\" and arguing that it \"seemed to betray the reality of the show itself\".\n\nOther figures associated with \"The Simpsons\" have publicly criticized the episode. In an April 2001 interview, Harry Shearer, the voice of Principal Skinner, recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, \"That's \"so\" wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience.\"\n\nIn a December 2006 interview, Shearer added, \"Now, [the writers] refuse to talk about it. They realize it was a horrible mistake. They never mention it. It's like they're punishing [the audience] for paying attention.\" In the introduction to the ninth season DVD boxset, series creator Matt Groening describes \"The Principal and the Pauper\" as \"one of [his] least favorite episodes\". He also called the episode \"a mistake\" in an interview with \"Rolling Stone\".\n\nIn contrast, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", praised the episode, calling it \"one of the series' all-time best episodes, mainly because it shows us a human side, not just of Principal Skinner, but of his hectorish Mom as well.\" They add that \"Martin Sheen steals the show ... in a brief but important slice of Simpsons history.\" \"Total Film\"s Nathan Ditum named Martin Sheen's performance in the episode the 20th best guest appearance on \"The Simpsons\".\nKen Keeler, Bill Oakley, and Josh Weinstein all defend the episode in its DVD commentary. Keeler asserts, \"I am very, very proud of the job I did on this episode. This is the best episode of television I feel I ever wrote.\" He describes the episode as a commentary on \"people who like things just the way they are\", and remarks, \"It never seems to have occurred to anyone that this episode is about the people who hate it.\" However, Keeler says that some of the dialogue was changed from his original draft, making this point less obvious. Oakley and Weinstein explain that they wanted to push the boundaries of the series while working as show-runners, and advise viewers to treat \"The Principal and the Pauper\" as an \"experiment\". They surmise that the negative reception was partly due to the fact that it was not immediately apparent to viewers that this was such an episode (as opposed to, for example, \"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase\"). They also describe the ending of the episode as an attempt to reset the continuity and allow fans to consider the episode as non-canonical, divorced from the larger series.\n\nLater episodes of \"The Simpsons\" contain references to \"The Principal and the Pauper\". A clip from the episode was used in season eleven's \"Behind the Laughter\" as an example of the show's increasingly \"gimmicky and nonsensical plots\". In the season fifteen episode \"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\", Lisa addresses Principal Skinner as \"Principal \"Tamzarian\"\" when Skinner chides her for naming her new cat Snowball II, after a cat that had died earlier in the episode.\n\n\n"}

The yard gained international fame when Solidarity (\"Solidarność\") was founded there in September 1980. It is situated on the left side of Martwa Wisła and on\nOstrów Island.\n\nGdańsk Shipyard was founded in 1946 as a state-owned company, on sites of the former German shipyards, Schichau-Werft and Danziger Werft, both considerably damaged in the Second World War. On 1 July 1952 a state-owned enterprise called Baza Remontowa – Ostrow was established on Ostrów Island. The name changed to Gdańska Stocznia Remontowa later in the year. During the time of the People's Republic of Poland, the complex was known as the Gdańsk Shipyard and Vladimir Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk (1967–89).\n\nThe Northern Shipyard (Stocznia Północna) was also formed in June 1945, when it was known as Shipyard No. 3. Its activities were mainly production and repairs of trains, trams and small floating units. In December 1945 Shipyard No. 3 had a workforce of 694, including 8 engineers and 28 technicians. Launches began in 1948 – smacks for the Gdańsk Institute of Sea Fishing were delivered and 53 rescue boats were built. In 1949 the shipyard started to produce fishing lugo-trawlers. In February 1950 Shipyard No3 changed its name to Northern Shipyard and in 1951 it ended production of trains, specializing instead in small cargo ships, fishing vessels and scientific ships. In 1952 the shipyard delivered 14 vessels. After 1955, the shipyard built vessels for the navies of Poland, USSR, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and East Germany – mainly for troop landing craft, hydrographic, rescue, training and torpedo boats. In 1975 the shipyard was named \"Westerplatte Heroes\".\n\nIn 1980 Gdańsk was the arena for events that marked the beginning of organized resistance to Communist dictatorship in eastern Europe. A strike by 17,000 ship builders saw Solidarity (Solidarność), led by shipyard electrician Lech Wałęsa, recognised as the first non-Communist trade union in the then Soviet Bloc. The move was one of the first successful steps in a campaign of civil resistance that contributed to the eventual collapse of Communism across eastern Europe.\n\nThrough the 1980s, Northern Shipyard continued to produce super-trawlers, super-seiners, hydrographic units and troop landing craft for the Soviet Union – the last four were delivered in 1991. Contracts signed with the Communist-era Polish Navy were delivered in the early 1990s. Difficulties on the world market forced radical changes and the yard began to specialize in cargo containers, mainly for Germany and Nigeria.\n\nIn 1990, the state-owned Stocznia Gdańska became a joint stock company with 61% in National Treasury shares and 31% owned by employees. Since then, Gdańsk Shipyard has operated as Stocznia Gdańsk S.A. On 1 April 1993 Northern Shipyard of \"Westerplatte Heroes\" became a corporation, under the name Northern Shipyard S.A. In the late 1990s the shipyard produced ferries, fishing vessels, tugboats and ships for the offshore industry. Since June 2003, the main shareholder has been Gdańsk \"Repair\" Shipyard. As part of the Repair Group, Northern Shipyard can offer highly technical specialized products – from design through to fully equipped ship. The shipyard now produces specialist ships, including LNG/LPG transport ships, passenger-car ferries, container vessels, offshore boats, hydrographic and scientific ships. These vessels sail under the flags of: Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, UK, USA and Poland.\n\nSS \"Sołdek\" (a coal and ore freighter) was the first ship built in Poland after World War II. Launched on 6 November 1947 for a Polish owner, she was the first of 29 ships Project B30 type, built in 1949 – 1954 in Stocznia Gdańska.\n\nSS \"Sołdek\" is now preserved as a museum ship in Gdańsk.\n\nOver 60 years, Stocznia Gdańsk has delivered more than 1000 seagoing ships to owners all over the world. In recent years, the top deliveries have been container ships, reefers, bulk carriers and passenger ro-ro ferries. Most ships are designed in their own design office. Design and construction of ships has remained the main activity of the yard. Work for the offshore industry began in the 21st century.\n\nGdańsk shipyards have fallen on hard times. Once a place of work for over 20,000 people, the Gdańsk shipyards provide only 2,200 jobs today. The European Union has backed a restructuring plan for the shipyard.\n\nAbout 77 companies now operate on the grounds of the shipyards, including GSG Towers, which builds steel towers for wind turbines.\n\nThe shipyard's Gate Number Two, for decades the focus of strikes and celebrations, has become a pilgrimage destination.\n\nIn 2005, French electronic music composer Jean Michel Jarre performed a multimedia concert at the shipyard to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Solidarity movement. The concert was a one-off event, attracting 170,000 spectators on site, over 6 million television viewers and resulted in the release of the \"Live from Gdańsk\" (2005) album.\n\nDavid Gilmour, guitarist for Pink Floyd played a concert at the shipyard in 2006 to celebrate the anniversary of the Polish revolution as part of the Solidarity movement. The concert, which attracted 50.000 spectators, closed his 2006 world tour in support of \"On an Island\" (2006) and is documented on the \"Live in Gdańsk\" (2008) album.\n\nIndustrial Union of Donbas obtained 75% shares of the shipyard through privatisation in 2007, with the remaining share held by the Polish government. The Polish government regained shares of the shipyard from IDS in 2018 reaching 50%.\n\n"}

{"id": "2056353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056353", "title": "Ordet", "text": "Ordet\n\nOrdet (, meaning \"The Word\" and originally released as The Word in English), is a 1955 Danish drama film, directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer. It is based on a play by Kaj Munk, a Danish Lutheran priest, first performed in 1932. The film won the Golden Lion at the 16th Venice International Film Festival, and was the only film by Dreyer to be both a critical and financial success.\n\nThe film is now regarded by many critics as a masterpiece, admired particularly for its cinematography.\n\nThe film centers around the Borgen family in rural Denmark during the autumn of 1925. The devout widower Morten, patriarch of the family, prominent member of the community, and patron of the local parish church, has three sons. Mikkel, the eldest, who has no faith, is happily married to the pious Inger, who is pregnant with their third child. Johannes, who went insane studying Søren Kierkegaard, believes himself to be Jesus Christ and wanders the farm condemning the age's lack of faith, including that of his family and the modern-minded new pastor of the village. The youngest son, Anders, is lovesick for the daughter of the leader of a local Inner Mission sect.\n\nAnders confesses to Mikkel and Inger that he loves Anne Petersen, the daughter of Peter the Tailor. They agree to convince Morten to assent to the match. Later, Inger attempts to convince Morten to allow Anders to marry Anne. Morten angrily refuses, but changes his mind when he finds out Peter has refused Anders' proposal. Morten and Anders go to meet Peter, in order to negotiate the betrothal.\n\nMorten tries to convince Peter to permit the marriage, but he continues to refuse unless Morten and Anders join his sect. As the discussion collapses into sectarian bickering, Morten receives a call announcing that Inger has gone into a difficult labor. Peter says he hopes Inger will die. Maybe then Morten will see the error of his ways and join Peter's sect. Furious at Peter's comments, Morten attacks Peter and storms out with Anders, the two of them rushing home. While the doctor is forced to abort the baby, he is able to save Inger's life. After the doctor and pastor leave, Johannes angers his father by telling him that death is nearby and will take Inger, unless Morten has faith in him. Morten refuses to listen and, as prophesied, Inger dies suddenly.\n\nWhile preparing to go to Inger's funeral, Peter realizes that he has wronged Morten terribly, and reconciles with him over Inger's open coffin, agreeing to permit Anne and Anders to marry. Johannes suddenly interrupts the wake, approaches Inger's coffin, and proclaims that she can be raised from the dead if the family will only have faith and ask God to do so. Inger's daughter takes Johannes' hand and impatiently asks him to raise her mother from the dead. Johannes praises her childlike faith and asks God to raise Inger, who begins to breathe and twitch in her coffin. Seeing what seems to be the miracle of resurrection, both Morten and Peter rejoice, forgetting their religious differences. As Inger sits up, Mikkel embraces her and proclaims that he has finally found faith.\n\n\nAfter several years of financial problems stalled his film career, Dreyer was awarded a lifelong lease to the Dagmar Bio, an art-house movie theater in Copenhagen, in 1952 . The Danish government had often given such awards to older artists, and the profits from the theater allowed Dreyer to begin production on a new film through Palladium Studios. Around that time, Palladium president Tage Nielsen received a suggestion for Dreyer's next film from the government-run Dansk Kulturfilm; Dreyer had worked with them before. Kaj Munk's play \"I Begyndelsen var Ordet\" (\"In the Beginning was the Word\") was written in 1925 and premiered in Copenhagen in 1932. Dreyer had attended the play's premiere in 1932 and had been writing notes for a film adaptation since 1933.\n\nDansk Kulturfilm suggested that Dreyer finally make the film and be retroactively paid for his years of work on the script. Munk had himself finished a script for a film version, which he tried and failed to sell to the production company Nordisk Film. The Swedish film adaptation, \"The Word,\" directed by Gustaf Molander and starring Victor Sjöström, was released In 1943. It couldn't premiere in Denmark until after World War II. For legal reasons, the 1943 film forced Palladium to wait until 1954 to begin production on Dreyer's film. Dreyer made changes to the original play, such as adding the film's opening scene (which was inspired by a passage from Munk's published memoir), omitting Johannes's previous love affair as a contributor to his mental illness and cutting two-thirds of Munk's original dialogue. Although he was careful to stay true to Munk's intention and the play's message, he cut dialogue down to the bare essentials, resulting in a minimalist film.\n\nFilming lasted for four months: two months on a studio set and two months in Vedersø, a village in West Jutland where Munk had served as a Lutheran priest. \"Ordet\" is best remembered for its cinematography. The film has a total of 114 individual shots, half of which occur in the first and last scenes of the film. Many shots lasted for up to seven minutes. Dreyer used mostly long takes and a slow moving camera, as his style had been gradually progressing towards for several years. He also paid close attention to every minute detail during filming and later said that he \"made the film crew equip the kitchen with everything he considered right for a country kitchen. Then...he set about removing the objects. Finally, only ten to fifteen remained, but they were just what were wanted to create the right psychological illusion.\"\n\nDreyer's shooting method was to shoot one individual shot per day. In the mornings Dreyer would rehearse with the actors while simultaneously blocking their movement, set up lights and block the camera movement. Then at the very end of the day Dreyer would film the single shot, usually shooting between 2 and 3 takes. Dreyer chose not to pre-plan any shots and every decision was made the day of the shoot.\n\nCinematographer Henning Bendtsen said that \"each image is composed like a painting in which the background and the lighting are carefully prepared.\" Whereas most filmmakers at that time would use one or two lights for a scene, Dreyer and Bendtsen often used up to 20. Electricians often had to turn lights on and off during the shooting without it being noticeable on film. Dreyer disliked light meters and preferred to deduce the correct exposure at each location by eye. Actress Birgitte Federspiel said that “Lighting was his great gift and he did it with expertise. He shaped light artistically like a sculptor or a painter would.”\n\nDreyer staged the actors around the lighting design on the set and not to accommodate their performances. Federspiel said that Dreyer never verbally told the actors when he was pleased with their performances and would simply smile when they were performing the way that he wanted them to. The blocking of the actor's movement was so precise and carefully planned out that many of them had to count out their steps while speaking their dialogue. Federspiel said that Dreyer personally picked out costumes for every actor and even went shopping for stockings with her. He also hired a linguistic specialist to make sure that all the actors spoke the same dialect as the characters that they played. Dreyer had some difficulty with the elderly actor Henrik Malberg being able to remember his dialogue for such long takes. Munk had written the original role of Morten Borgen specially for Malberg in 1925.\n\nTwice in the movie, as Morten and Anders drive to and from their meeting with Peter the Tailor, they pass the rough cross erected at the place where the body of Kaj Munk was found. Munk was assassinated in 1944 during the Nazi occupation of Denmark for openly preaching against collaboration with the Nazi regime.\n\nLike her character, Federspiel was really pregnant during the film's production and went into labor towards the end of the shoot. She agreed to allow Dreyer to tape record her labor pains while she was giving birth and then later use the recording as a sound effect in the finished film. While waiting for Federspiel to return to the production after having the child Dreyer and Bendtsen planned out the final resurrection scene. They shot two different versions of the scene, a version from Munk's play which suggests the possibility of Inger just appearing to be dead and a version where the resurrection is a genuine miracle. Dreyer chose to use the second version in the final film.\n\nThe film premiered on 10 January 1955 at Dagmar Teatret in Copenhagen. It was Dreyer's first film since \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" to immediately receive critical praise and was especially popular in his native Denmark with both critics and audiences, as well as with critics in other countries. It also won the Golden Lion at the 16th Venice International Film Festival.\n\nCritic Roger Ebert gave the film a 4/4. He wrote \"For the ordinary filmgoer, and I include myself, \"Ordet\" is a difficult film to enter. But once you're inside, it is impossible to escape.\" Critic Tom Milne wrote that \"the interior scenes are luminous with a sense of expansive affection arising from the rich, warmly observed detail of the relationship...Throughout the film Dreyer's emphasis is on the density of emotion allied to gesture which he first explored in \"Master of the House\". Critic Robin Wood also praised the film, but wrote that \"our sense of the interdependence of the characters and their actions is communicated visually...one cannot but admire the total essentials, a process that certainly imbues those essentials with expressive intensity. At the same time, I find it difficult not to react against the style as repressive and deadening.\" Dave Calhoun of \"Time Out\" wrote that \"‘Powerful’ doesn't do justice\" to the film and that it \"reminds us how in the end we know little about the mysteries of life. Dreyer manages to say all this within the framework of a strange, wondrous and shocking work. Once seen, it’s unlikely to leave you.\" Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" called it \"a gripping and eerie tragedy of the supernatural\", but also thought it was not as good as \"Day of Wrath\" or \"The Passion of Joan Of Arc\".\n\nRotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 100% based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 9.62/10.\n\nIt has been released on DVD by The Criterion Collection with spine number 126 as part of a box set with the other Dreyer films \"Day of Wrath\" and \"Gertrud\".\n\n\"Ordet\" was entered into the 16th Venice International Film Festival and won its highest prize, the Golden Lion. In 1956 the film was among films honored with the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, as well as the National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Film in 1957. At the 1955 Bodil Awards it won for Best Actor (Emil Hass Christensen), Best Actress (Birgitte Federspiel), and tied for Best Danish film with Sven Methling's \"Der kom en dag\". It is currently ranked as the third most spiritually significant film of all time by Arts and Faith online community.\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook.\n\nAitken was born on 15 February 1910 in Montreal, the son of Gladys Henderson (Drury) and Max Aitken (later Lord Beaverbrook). He was educated at Westminster School and Pembroke College, Cambridge. A talented sportsman, he was a University blue at football and a scratch golfer. A keen flyer, he spent some time in the thirties flying throughout Europe and the USA. He joined the Royal Auxiliary Air Force in 1935, and was commissioned a pilot officer on 11 September. He was promoted to flying officer on 14 April 1937.\n\nOn 15 May 1940, Aitken was promoted to flight lieutenant in the Auxiliary Air Force. Aitken served as a Bristol Blenheim and then a Hawker Hurricane pilot with No. 601 Squadron RAF during the early part of the Second World War, becoming commanding officer in June 1940, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1940, and the Distinguished Service Order, in 1942, for eight combat claims. Leaving the squadron on 20 July 1940, he then served as commanding officer of No. 68 Squadron RAF, a night fighter unit, from February 1941 until January 1943, claiming four night victories.\n\nServing in the Middle East during the middle war years as wing commander, although he was officially non-operational, he managed to shoot down two Junkers Ju 52 aircraft while flying with No. 46 Squadron RAF in Beaufighters.\n\nAitken became wing leader of the Banff Strike Wing (RAF Coastal Command) in 1944. He reached the rank of group captain, achieving 16 1/2 kills (one a shared aircraft). He did some of his early flying training with Richard Hillary, to whom he was known as Bill, and was featured in Hillary's book \"The Last Enemy\".\n\nIn 1946, he entered the family newspaper business, as a director of the Express Group, and would become Chairman of Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd. At the 1945 general election, Aitken was elected Member of Parliament for Holborn with a majority of 925.\n\nUnfavourable boundary changes meant that the Labour Party took the successor seat in 1950 comfortably and Aitken did not stand at that or subsequent elections. He also served as Chancellor of the University of New Brunswick.\n\nHe appears in the famous World War II documentary \"The World at War\" giving a variety of interviews, including the episode \"Alone in Britain.\"\n\nIn the late 1950s, Aitken witnessed one of the early Miami Nassau Offshore Powerboat Races, then participated in the following year with his wife, Lady Violet. It was the experience of this new “sport” that led to his announcement at the 1961 London Boat Show of a similar ocean race to be staged in the south of England in August that year.\n\nTogether with John Coote they formulated the rules that saw the birth of the Cowes Torquay Offshore Powerboat Race, with the aim of improving the breed of sea-going fast cruisers and safety at sea.\nThe Cowes Torquay will celebrate in 2010 the 50th year since Aitken founded it.\n\nAitken, with the sponsorship of his newspaper the \"Daily Express\", helped to found the London International Boat Show in 1954 at the Empire Hall, Olympia.\n\nAitken married three times:\n\nHe succeeded his father as Baron Beaverbrook on the latter's death on 9 June 1964, but disclaimed the title three days later on 12 June, stating that \"there shall only be one Lord Beaverbrook in my lifetime\". On his death in 1985, his son, also Max Aitken, took on the title.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2056361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056361", "title": "Influences on the Spanish language", "text": "Influences on the Spanish language\n\nThe Spanish language (also known as \"Castilian\") has a long history of borrowing words, expressions and subtler features of other languages it has come in contact with.\n\nSpanish developed from Vulgar Latin, with a lexical influence from Arabic and from Paleohispanic languages such as Celtiberian and Basque. \n\nSpanish has also absorbed many loanwords from other Romance languages—French, Occitan, Catalan, Portuguese, and Italian.\n\nIn the Americas, Spanish is now spoken by people of a great variety of cultural backgrounds, including those of Amerindian and African heritage. The extensive contact with native American languages especially has resulted in the adoption of many lexical items from these languages, not only in local dialects of Spanish, but throughout the language as a whole.\n\nAs Spanish went through its first stages of development in Spain, it probably received influences from neighbouring Romance languages, and also from Basque, which is a language isolate and thus completely unrelated to Spanish in origin. Umbrian and Oscan influences have also been postulated for the Roman colonization period.\n\nTwo specific types of lenition, the voicing of voiceless consonants and the elision of voiced consonants (both of which are discussed at greater length below), are the phonological changes of Spanish that are most often attributed to the influence of Celtic languages; they have also been attributed to the influence of the Basque language. While examples of these two types of lenition are ubiquitous and well-documented in Spanish, two assumptions need to be made if these two types of lenition are to be attributed to patterns of lenition in Celtic languages. The first assumption is that a population of bilingual Celtiberian–Vulgar Latin speakers existed long enough to have had an influence on the development of Old Spanish. The second assumption is that Continental Celtic, an extinct branch of Celtic, did indeed exhibit the types of lenition that are known to exist in modern Insular Celtic languages. Alternatively, the Spanish development may therefore just be a natural internal process, not due to outside influence.\n\nMany Castilians who took part in the Reconquista and later repopulation campaigns of Muslim Iberia were of Basque lineage and this is evidenced by many place names throughout Spain. The change from Latin 'f-' to Spanish 'h-' was once commonly ascribed to the influence of Basque speakers for a few reasons. The change from [f] to [h] was first documented in the areas around northern Castile and La Rioja, areas that are close to the Basque-speaking area. The change to [h] took place to a greater degree in the Gascon language in Gascony, in southwestern France, an area that is close to the Basque Country too. The claim is that the Basque language lacked the [f] sound and thus substituted it with [h], the closest thing to [f] in that language.\n\nThere are some difficulties with attributing this change to Basque, however. There is no hard evidence that medieval Basque did or did not have an [f] sound. Presumably early borrowings of forms with initial [f] into Basque were usually received as [p] or [b] (e.g. FESTA > Basque \"pesta\" or \"besta\", depending on the dialect), rather than [h]. Adding to this is the fact that the f-to-h lenition is not peculiar to Spanish. In fact, the change from [f] to [h] is one of the most common phonological changes in all kinds of world languages. According to the explanations that negate or downplay Basque influence, the change occurred in the affected dialects wholly independent of each other as the result of internal change (i.e. linguistic factors, not outside influence). It is also possible that the two forces worked in concert and reinforced each other.\n\nAnother claim of Basque influence in Spanish is the voiceless alveolar retracted sibilant [], a sound roughly intermediate between laminodental [] and palatal []; this sound also appears in other Ibero-Romance languages and in Catalan. The apico-alveolar retracted sibilant might be a result of bilingualism of speakers of Basque and Vulgar Latin.\n\nSpain was controlled by the Visigoths between the 5th and 8th centuries. However, the influence of the Gothic language (an East Germanic language) on Spanish was minimal because the invaders were already somewhat Romanized, were secluded in the upper echelons of society, and generally did not intermarry with the natives. Besides a few military words, Spanish borrowed the following from Gothic:\n\n\nAlthough Germanic languages by most accounts affected the phonological development very little, Spanish words of Germanic origin are present in all varieties of Modern Spanish. Many of the Spanish words of Germanic origin were already present in Vulgar Latin, and so they are shared with other Romance languages. Other Germanic words were borrowed in more recent times; for example, the words for the cardinal directions (\"norte\", \"este\", \"sur\", \"oeste\" — 'north', 'east', 'south', 'west') are not documented until late in the 15th century. These direction words are thought to be from Old English, probably by way of French.\n\nIn 711 AD, most of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by Arabic-speaking Muslims, who had recently also conquered a large part of northwest Africa. Loanwords from Arabic thus entered Castilian from a very early period. This lexical influence reached its greatest level during the Christian Reconquista, when the emerging Kingdom of Castile conquered large territories from Moorish rulers in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries. These territories had large numbers of speakers of Arabic, as well as many who spoke local Romance dialects (Mozarabic language) that were heavily influenced by Arabic, both influencing Castilian. Arabic words and their derivatives were also brought into Spanish by Mozarab Christians who emigrated northwards from Al-Andalus in times of sectarian violence, particularly during the times of Almohad and Almoravid rule in the 12th and 13th centuries. Due to the long-lasting presence and influence of Arabic, mainly in southern Iberia, Spanish has a significant lexical component from that language, constituting some 8% of its vocabulary according to some estimates. \n\nSpanish borrowed words from Arabic in many semantic fields:\n\n\nMany of these borrowings (especially in the scientific field) were then passed on to other languages (English acquired most of them through French).\n\nMost Spanish nouns beginning with the letters \"al-\" (from the Arabic definite article) have their origin in Arabic.\n\nAs to how many words in Modern Spanish are of Arabic origin, the estimates vary widely, depending largely on whether the count includes derived forms and place names. One respected authority suggests that they number more than 4,000, based on estimates of 850 of known etymology, 780 forms derived from them, 1,000 place names, 500 additional place names of \"probable\" Arabic origin, and \"very numerous\" Arabic-looking words whose affiliation has not yet been established. The largest Spanish etymological dictionary — the \"Diccionario crítico etimológico de la lengua castellana\", by Joan Corominas — lists slightly over 1,000 words of Arabic origin, while Wikipedia's own List of Spanish words of Arabic origin, based on etymologies given by the Real Academia Española so far includes 1,200 confirmed Arabisms, excluding place names and derivatives.\n\nMorphological borrowing was scarce. The suffíx \"-í\" (deriving adjectives from place names, as in \"Marbellí\", \"Ceutí\" or \"Iraní\", \"from Marbella\", \"from Ceuta\", or \"from Iran\" respectively) is an example.\n\nIn October 1492 Christopher Columbus made his first landfall in the Americas, and thereafter Spanish settlers began to come into contact with a host of native American languages. Most of these were wiped out or severely reduced in number of speakers and distribution area during the conquest, but Spanish adopted a number of words from some of them. The following list is by no means exhaustive.\n\n\nThose words referring to local features or animals might be limited to regional usage, but many others like \"cóndor\", \"canoa\" or \"chocolate\" are extended even to other languages.\n\nSpanish borrowed many words from other European languages: its close neighbors such as Catalan or Portuguese, other Romance languages such as Italian and French (this particularly during the Neoclassicist to Napoleonic periods, when French language and culture became the fashion at the royal court), and Germanic languages like English. For example:\n\n\nIn recent times, Spanish has borrowed many words and expressions from English, especially in the fields of computers and the Internet. In many cases, technical expressions that superficially employ common Spanish words are in fact calques from English equivalents. For example, \"disco duro\" is a literal translation of \"hard disk\". Words like blog, chat, and weblog are used, though \"\" (from \"cuaderno de bitácora\", the captain's log on a boat) is also common.\n\nSome authors estimate that seventy-five percent of Spanish words have come from Latin and were in use in Spain before the Common Era. The remaining 25 percent come from other languages. Of these languages (and language families), the four that have contributed the most words are Arabic, Indigenous languages of the Americas, Germanic, and Celtic in roughly that order.\n\nAfrican – \nAmericas – \nArabic – \nAustronesian – \nBasque – \nCeltic – \nChinese – \nEtruscan – \nFrench – \nGermanic –\nIberian –\nIndo-Aryan –\nIranian – \nItalic – \nSemitic – \nTurkic – \nuncertain –\nvarious origins.\n\n\n\nCategory:History of the Spanish language\n"}

QUINSA owns 30% of Quilmes, with 53% of the voting rights within the corporation.\n\nIn 2002, Brazilian company AmBev bought 37.5% of Quilmes S.A. in an agreement that gave AmBev control of the Quilmes brand in Argentina. The merger of the two companies created, for a brief time, the world's third-largest beverage producer.\n\nIn 2006 AmBev increased its share of the company to over 91%, effectively taking full control of the Quilmes name.\n\n"}

The latter edition is aimed at translators and so focuses on variants that are important for the meaning whereas the NA includes more variants.\n\nThe Greek text as presented is what biblical scholars refer to as the \"critical text\". The critical text is an eclectic text compiled by a committee that compares readings from a large number of manuscripts in order to determine which reading is most likely to be closest to the original. They use a number of factors to help determine probable readings, such as the date of the witness (earlier is usually better), the geographical distribution of a reading, and the likelihood of accidental or intentional corruptions. In the book, a large number of textual variants, or differences between manuscripts, are noted in the critical apparatus—the extensive footnotes that distinguish the \"Novum Testamentum Graece\" from other Greek New Testaments.\n\nMost scholars view uncial text as the most accurate; however, a few authors, such as New Testament scholar Maurice A. Robinson and linguist Wilbur Pickering, Arthur Farstad and Zane C. Hodges claim that the minuscule texts (the Byzantine text-type) more accurately reflect the \"autographs\" or original texts than an eclectic text like NA28 that relies heavily on manuscripts of the Alexandrian text-type. This view has been criticized by Gordon Fee and Bruce Metzger among others. Since the majority of old manuscripts in existence are minuscules, they are often referred to as the Majority Text. It is worth noting, though, that the Majority Text as a whole is classified by the editors of the NA28 (of whom Metzger is one) as a \"consistently cited witness of the first order,\" meaning that whenever the text presented differs from the majority text this is recorded in the apparatus along with the alternate reading. Other consistently cited references include the full corpus of papyrus manuscripts available to the authors as well as a wide range of other manuscripts including a selection of both minuscules and uncials.\n\nThe \"Novum Testamentum Graece\" apparatus summarizes the evidence (from manuscripts and versions) for, and sometimes against, a selection of the most important variants for the study of the text of the New Testament. While eschewing completeness (in the range of variants and in the citation of witnesses), this edition does provide informed readers with a basis by which they can judge for themselves which readings more accurately reflect the originals. The Greek text of the 28th edition is the same as that of the 5th edition of the United Bible Societies \"The Greek New Testament\" (abbreviated UBS5) although there are a few differences between them in paragraphing, capitalization, punctuation and spelling. The critical apparatus is different in the two editions; the UBS5 edition is prepared for the use of translators, and includes fewer textual variants, but adds extra material helpful for translators.\n\nThe first edition published by Eberhard Nestle in 1898 combined the readings of the editions of Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort and Weymouth, placing the majority reading of these in the text and the third reading in the apparatus. In 1901, he replaced the Weymouth New Testament with Bernhard Weiss's text. In later editions, Nestle began noting the attestation of certain important manuscripts in his apparatus.\n\nEberhard's son Erwin Nestle took over after his father's death and issued the 13th edition in 1927. This edition introduced a separate critical apparatus and finally introduced consistency to the majority reading principle. In the apparatus only a few minuscules were included.\n\nKurt Aland became the associate editor of the 21st edition in 1952. At Erwin Nestle's request, he reviewed and expanded the critical apparatus, adding many more manuscripts. This eventually led to the 25th edition of 1963. The most important Papyri and newly discovered Uncials, as 0189, a few Minuscules (33, 614, 2814), occasionally also lectionaries were taken into account.\n\nThe great manuscript discoveries of the 20th century had also made a revision of the text necessary and, with Nestle's permission, Aland set out to revise the text of \"Novum Testamentum Graece\". Aland submitted his work on NA to the editorial committee of the United Bible Societies \"Greek New Testament\" (of which he was also a member) and it became the basic text of their third edition (UBS3) in 1975, four years before it was published as the 26th edition of Nestle-Aland.\n\nMembers of the Editorial Committee of the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament comprise:\n\nIn 2011 the Global Board of the United Bible Societies appointed a new editorial committee that will prepare future editions of the \"Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece\" as well as of the \"Greek New Testament\". The committee consists of Christos Karakolis (University of Athens, Greece), David Parker (University of Birmingham, United Kingdom), Stephen Pisano (Pontifical Biblical Institute, Italy, a university of the Holy See), Holger Strutwolf (University Münster, Germany), David Trobisch (Museum of the Bible/Green Collection Oklahoma City, USA) and Klaus Wachtel (University Münster, Germany).\n\nIn all but the Catholic Epistles, the 28th edition of Nestle-Aland reproduces the text of NA27 (the same text used in UBS4 and UBS5) and presents a revised critical apparatus and a rewritten introduction and appendices. In the Catholic Epistles, the text has been edited in line with the \"Editio Critica Maior\" and its use of the Coherence-Based Genealogical Method (CBGM). The result is a change in just over 30 places.\n\nA more complete set of variants is listed in the multiple volume \"Novum Testamentum Graecum – Editio Critica Maior\". A small number of textual changes in the most current edition were incorporated in the 28th edition of the Nestle-Aland, published in 2012. Papyri 117-127 were used in this edition.\n\nThe NA28 text is published by Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft (the German Bible Society).\n\nIn \"The Text of the New Testament\", Kurt Aland and Barbara Aland compare the total number of variant-free verses, and the number of variants per page (excluding orthographic errors), among the seven major editions of the Greek NT (Tischendorf, Westcott-Hort, von Soden, Vogels, Merk, Bover, and Nestle-Aland) concluding 62.9%, or 4999/7947, agreement. They concluded, \"Thus in nearly two-thirds of the New Testament text, the seven editions of the Greek New Testament which we have reviewed are in complete accord, with no differences other than in orthographical details (e.g., the spelling of names, etc.). Verses in which any one of the seven editions differs by a single word are not counted. This result is quite amazing, demonstrating a far greater agreement among the Greek texts of the New Testament during the past century than textual scholars would have suspected […]. In the Gospels, Acts, and Revelation the agreement is less, while in the letters it is much greater.\" For over 250 years, New Testament scholars have argued that no textual variant affects key Christian doctrine.\n\nEarlier translations of the Bible, including the King James Version, tended to rely on Byzantine type texts, such as the Textus Receptus. A number of translations began to use critical Greek editions, beginning with the translation of the Revised Version in England in 1881-1885 (using Westcott and Hort's Greek Text). English translations produced during the twentieth century increasingly reflected the work of textual criticism, although even new translations are often influenced by earlier translation efforts.\n\nA comparison of the textual and stylistic choices of twenty translations against 15,000 variant readings shows the following rank of agreement with the Nestle-Aland 27th edition:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2056410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056410", "title": "Earl Manigault", "text": "Earl Manigault\n\nEarl Manigault (September 7, 1944 – May 15, 1998) was an American street basketball player who was nicknamed \"the goat\".\n\nEarl Manigault was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and raised in Harlem, New York. He grew up playing basketball and practiced constantly. With per game averages of 24 points and 11 rebounds, Manigault starred at Benjamin Franklin High School, a basketball powerhouse in the Public School Athletic League. Manigault set the NYC junior high school record by scoring 57 points in a game in the late 1950s. While attending high school, Manigault's life took a fateful turn when he began associating with groups that would eventually lead to his expulsion. He started using drugs and skipping classes. He was the star of his high school team and seemed destined for greatness in the National Basketball Association. Manigault was expelled from school for smoking marijuana. He finished high school at a private academy, Laurinburg Institute, in North Carolina. In one year there, he averaged 31 points and 13 rebounds per game.\n\nHe enrolled in Johnson C. Smith University, but left after one semester due to his constant problems with school and continuous quibbles with the coach.\n\nThe nickname \"Goat\" has several proposed origins. In an article for the \"New York Times\", Earl stated that he got the nickname because a junior high school teacher kept pronouncing his name \"Mani-Goat.\" Other theories state that by the time Manigault was in high school, he was known as \"The Goat\" because of his quiet demeanor. Another states that the nickname started by confusion over Manigault's last name; people thought Manigault referred to himself as Earl Nanny Goat, so he became \"The Goat\". However, the most popular belief is that he was called The Goat as the acronym for Greatest Of All Time. Although it is unclear how the name was dubbed, Greatest of All Time is the idea that lasted. The \"Happy Warrior Playground\" on Amsterdam at West 99th Street in Manhattan is more commonly referred to as \"Goat Park\" where Manigault reigned.\n\nHe was mentored by Holcombe Rucker.\n\nManigault was particularly famous for his leaping abilities on the basketball court. However much of his legend is unsupported playground myth, including his signature move - the double dunk. He allegedly would dunk the ball, catch it with his left hand, switch the ball to his right hand, bring it back around to the top of the basket and jam it through again, all done while still in the air on a single jump, and without hanging on the rim. However this is a story repeatedly told but unconfirmed. It was refuted by Manigault himself in a CNN interview available on YouTube when he called the reports of this feat rubbish, stating not even The Goat could do that. Like other street basketballers of the day such as Jackie Jackson, Earl was reportedly able to touch the top of the backboard to retrieve quarters and dollar bills, part of \"elaborate innovations and tricks\" elite street players of the era performed before games to help build their reputations. Again, this has never been confirmed. Like the dunking myth, it is always referred to as \"reportedly\" without a credible source to support it. It is refuted in Todd Gallagher's book \" Andy Roddick Beat Me With a Frying Pan.\" The book dedicates an entire chapter to this myth concluding it was never done by Manigault or anyone else, including NBA stars. Gallagher writes \" Earl \"The Goat\" Manigault is widely regarded as one of the greatest playground basketball players of all time. Although he never played in the NBA and only briefly played in college, the legend of Manigault has spread far and wide and led to his play being glorified in magazines, books, and even a movie starring Don Cheadle called \"\". There are a number of tales regarding Manigault's prowess, but the central story that propelled his legend was that he had such extraordinary leaping ability he could pull dollar bills off the top of the backboard and leave change. What made this even more amazing was that Manigault was, depending on who you talk to, somewhere between 5-11 and 6-1. Considering that the top of the backboard is at thirteen feet and the average six-foot-tall man can only touch about eight feet high standing flat-footed, Manigault would have had to jump at least sixty inches to even come close. He was only 6' 1\", but attributed his tremendous jumping ability to having in childhood often worn ankle weights during practice. (Such efficacy of ankle weights is doubtful, however.) He once reverse dunked 36 times in a row to win a $60 bet.\n\nBut to prove dunking was not his only skill, he would practice hundreds of shots each day, making him a deadly long-range shooter as well. Manigault played with some of the best players of his day, such as Earl Monroe, Connie Hawkins, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. When Abdul-Jabbar finished his career with the Los Angeles Lakers and had his number retired at the Los Angeles Forum, he was asked who was the greatest player he had played with or against and he responded by saying Manigault.\n\nEarl is featured in the 2012 documentary film \"Doin' it in the Park\" about New York City street basketball.\n\nManigault returned to Harlem and developed a heroin addiction. He served sixteen months in prison in 1969 and 1970 for drug possession. While incarcerated, Manigault was a subject in Pete Axthelm's book \"The City Game,\" which came to the attention of Utah Stars owner Bill Daniels.\n\nAfter he was released in 1970 at age 25, he hung in Lower Harlem, in and near the projects known as the Frederick Douglass Houses, often with close friends who enjoyed his humor and friendship—friends like Sleepy Thomas, L. Byrd and so many others. Later he tried out for the Utah Stars of the American Basketball Association, but he did not make the team and never played professionally. After shunning an offer from the Harlem Globetrotters, Manigault started the Goat Tournament, a summer tourney that would feature NBA stars such as Bernard King and Mario Elie. Still, his drug habit reappeared and he served another term of two years from 1977 to 1979 for a failed robbery attempt so he could buy heroin. After this prison term in the Bronx House of Detention and Sing Sing, Manigault quit heroin and moved to Charleston with his two youngest sons, far away from New York City and the temptation of drugs. In 1980, Manigault returned to New York and brought back the Goat Tournament. Never married, he started the \"Walk Away From Drugs\" tournament for kids in Harlem to prevent them from making the same mistakes he had made. Much of his later years were dedicated to working with kids on the court.\n\nManigault made a living by painting houses, mowing lawns, and working for the local recreation department. By the late 1980s, however, he was almost destitute, became frail, and suffered from serious heart problems. In February 1987, he had to have two heart operations. He became a counselor and coach at East Harlem's La Guardia Memorial House, working for New York's Supportive Children's Advocacy Network.\n\nManigault is quoted in the \"New York Times\" article 'A Fallen King Revisits His Realm' as saying \"For every Michael Jordan, there's an Earl Manigault. We all can't make it. Somebody has to fall. I was the one.\" \n\nManigault died from congestive heart failure in 1998 at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.\n\nIn 1996, HBO aired a TV movie about Manigault's life entitled \"\", starring Don Cheadle in the title role.\n\n"}
{"id": "2056411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056411", "title": "Royan", "text": "Royan\n\nRoyan (; and in the Saintongeais dialect) is a commune and town in the south-west of France, in the department of Charente-Maritime in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. Its inhabitants are known as \"Royannais\" and \"Royannaises\". Capital of the Côte de Beauté, Royan is one of the main French Atlantic coastal resort towns, and has five beaches, a marina for over 1,000 boats, and an active fishing port. As of 2013, the population of the greater urban area was 48,982. The town had 18,393 inhabitants in 2015.\n\nRoyan is located on the peninsula of Arvert, at the mouth of the Gironde estuary on its eastern shore. Royan was once of strategic importance, coveted in particular by the Visigoths and the Vikings. During the Reformation the city became a Protestant stronghold, and was besieged and destroyed by King Louis XIII of France (ruled 1610-43). During the Bourbon Restoration (1814–1830), and especially during the Second Empire (1852–1870), Royan was celebrated for its sea baths. It attracted many artists during the Roaring Twenties.\n\nAllied bombing between September 1944 and April 1945 destroyed the town. Known then as the \"martyred city\", it was declared a \"Laboratory of research on urbanism\", and it is now a showcase of the Modernist architecture of the 1950s. It was classified as a Town of Art and History (\"Ville d'Art et d'Histoire\") in 2010. Royan today is a tourist and cultural hub, with some 90,000 visitors each summer season.\n\nRoyan is a seaside resort town situated in the west of the department of Charente-Maritime, in the former province of Saintonge. It lies near the Atlantic coast on the eastern shore of the mouth of the Gironde, Europe's largest estuary. Along the coastline of the commune, limestone cliffs alternate with the five beaches known locally as \"conches\".\n\nThe town of Royan is built on a calcareous rock plateau dating from the Cretaceous Period (c. 150 million years ago). It is bounded by the Pousseau marshes to the north and the Pontaillac marshes to the west. The estuary, the cliffs and the \"conches\" were shaped approximately 66 million years ago by the folding of limestone layers as the Alps and the Pyrenees formed.\n\nRoyan is approximately from the administrative capital (prefecture) of the department, La Rochelle, by departmental road D 733 and national road (\"Route nationale\", RN) 137. It is from Bordeaux by departmental road D 730 and the A10 freeway, and from Paris. Between Royan and the town of Saintes, the historic capital of Saintonge and an important centre of art and history, travel time on the RN 150 is just under half an hour.\n\nRoyan SNCF railway station is the terminus of a line connecting the town to Saintes, Angoulême, and Niort (for the high-speed TGV rail link to Bordeaux and Paris).\n\nAcross the Gironde estuary, the station of La Pointe-de-Grave at Le Verdon-sur-Mer connects through the Médoc region to Bordeaux-Saint-Jean station.\n\nThe conurbation of Royan does not have its own airport. away, Rochefort-Saint-Agnant Airport offers flights to several European destinations, including the British Isles. La Rochelle – Île de Ré Airport is away. to the south, Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport provides international connections.\n\nThe TransGironde car-ferry provides bicycle, car and lorry transport across the Gironde estuary to the Medoc region. The crossing from Royan to Le Verdon-sur-mer takes almost 20 minutes).\nThe climate is oceanic: rainfall is relatively moderate in autumn and in winter and the winters are mild. Sea breezes keep summers temperatures moderate. Two winds, the north-westerly \"noroît\" and the south-westerly \"suroît\", blow in from the ocean and along the coast of the department. The very high average insolation of 2250 hours a year is comparable to the French Riviera.\n\nCharente-Maritime was the department most affected by Cyclone Martin on December 27, 1999. Winds speeds of up to were recorded on the island of Oléron, and in Royan, with severe damage to local buildings, woodland, and harbour facilities.\n\nThe site of Royan has been occupied since prehistoric times, as evidenced by archaeological finds of knapped flint. The Santones, a Celtic people, were early arrivals on the peninsula of Arvert. The Romans developed vineyards, oyster farming, and the saltern technique for salt production. The poet Tibullus celebrates the coast after the victory of his patron, the general Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, and the poet Ausonius built a villa here. The Visigoths arrived in Saintes in 418. In 419, defensive walls were built around Royan. Gregory of Tours mentions the usurpation of the church of Royan by the Arian Visigoths. In the summer of 844, the Vikings came up the Gironde, plundering everything in their path.\n\nAt the beginning of the 11th century, a precarious peace returned to the peninsula. Small fiefdoms and abbeys emerged. Between 1050 and 1075, the Prieuré de Saint-Vivien de Saintes built the Saint Pierre priory on the Saint-Pierre plateau, two kilometres from Royan and a small settlement grew there. In 1092, the Grande-Sauve Abbey built the Saint Nicolas priory nearby, on the Foncillon rock on the coast. A small castle in Royan protected the beach of Grande Conche, used as a harbour. Harbour activity was significant by the end of the 11th century, and many vessels used the Gironde estuary as a stopping point while waiting for favourable winds or currents. The Lord of Didonne took advantage of this to impose a tax on any boat mooring at the foot of the castle.\n\nIn 1137, Eleanor of Aquitaine married King Louis VII of France. Royan became part of the Duchy of Aquitaine, under direct royal control. In 1152, the marriage was annulled and Eleanor married Henry Plantagenet, who became King Henry II of England in 1154. Royan passed into English control.\n\nThe English king strengthened the town's defences with robust bulwarks and a solid keep. The various taxes paid by ships in the 13th century were codified by the Lords of Royan in 1232 as the Custom of Royan (\"Coutume de Royan\"). On May 20, 1242, King Henry III of England, at war with King Louis IX of France (Saint Louis), landed at Royan with 300 knights. Although defeated at Taillebourg, under the Treaty of Paris (1259) the English retained control of the south of Saintonge, and with it the town of Royan. In 1355, during the Hundred Years' War, the Black Prince, heir to the throne of England, occupied Saintonge and further strengthened Royan's defences. Royan became a large town, administered by twelve magistrates (\"échevins\") and twelve councillors. In 1451, at the end of the Hundred Years' War, the region had become definitively French but the town was in ruins.\n\nIn 1458, Marie de Valois (1444–1473), natural daughter of King Charles VII of France and his mistress Agnès Sorel, married Olivier de Coëtivy, Count of Taillebourg. She brought a dowry of 12,000 écus and the fiefdoms, or \"châtellenies\", of Royan and Mornac. In 1501, by his marriage to Louise de Coëtivy, Charles de la Trémoille became Baron of Royan. Commerce developed in the town, but access was made difficult by the town's fortifications. From the beginning of the 16th century, a new quarter developed along the beachfront.\n\nDuring the French Wars of Religion in the 16th century, many of the great captains of the time fought beneath the walls of the citadel, among them Henri de Navarre, who would become King Henry III of Navarre and then King Henry IV of France, and Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme, later a prior of Saint-Pierre-de-Royan). In 1592, Henry IV made the town a marquisate, granted to Gilbert de la Trémoille. At the beginning of the 17th century, Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette, the first Duke of Épernon, considered Royan \"one of better places of its size in France\". After the signing of the Edict of Nantes in 1598, it became a Protestant stronghold.\n\nThe town was besieged a first time in 1622 by King Louis XIII of France, but resisted. A second siege in 1623 caused great hardship. Many inhabitants abandoned the city and were banned from returning. The garrison was forced to surrender. In 1631, Cardinal Richelieu ordered the levelling of the town; the citadel was dismantled, and the ditches were filled in. The city, which no longer had a church, was associated with the rural parish of Saint Pierre.\n\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, a majority of the population emigrated, many people going to the Dutch Republic. Persecution continued under King Louis XV. A great storm in 1735 destroyed the harbour embankment, and navigation was not restored until the 19th century.\n\nOn December 22, 1789, the National Constituent Assembly set up in the early stages of the French Revolution voted for the administrative division of France into departments in place of the former provinces. The department of Charente-Inférieure was created on March 4, 1790 with the entry into force of this law. Each department was subdivided into districts, and each district into cantons. Royan became the administrative centre of its canton.\n\nRoyan elected a city council at that time, chaired by Daniel Renaud, a Protestant, and mayor Nicolas-Thérese Vallet of Salignac. On July 12, 1790, the National Constituent Assembly passed a law, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which subordinated the Catholic Church to the government. The priests of the parishes of Royan, Vaux and Saint-Sulpice refused to take an obligatory oath of allegiance to France under this law, so joining the group of \"refractory priests\" (\"prêtres réfractaires\") condemned to deportation.\n\nThroughout the country, church properties were seized. In Royan, the 1622 convent of the Récollets, set in grounds of , was put up for sale. It was bought on February 25, 1791, and then demolished, by shipowner Jean Boisseau.\n\nAs elsewhere, economic crisis caused growing dissatisfaction in Royan. To counter this, patriotic clubs were formed. On July 14, 1790, on the occasion of the first Festival of the Federation (\"Fête de la Fédération\" celebrations the French Revolution, a ceremony was organized in the church of Saint Pierre for the swearing of the solemn oath to the coming first French Constitution, adopted in 1791.\n\nAt the end of November 1790, mayor Nicolas-Thérese Vallet of Salignac was removed from office and was replaced by François d' Aulnis de Puiraveaux. In 1791, Daniel Renaud was elected mayor of the commune. In May 1791, the pro-republican, anti-royalist Society of the Friends of the Constitution established a branch in Royan. In general terms, however, the Reign of Terror (\"la Terreur\") after the creation of the First French Republic had little impact in the area, and few of the local nobles were affected.\n\nWork to pave the town's streets began in 1816, and was finally completed in 1826. In July 1819, mayor Raymond Labarthe signed the first order regulating sea bathing. This forbade nude bathing at beaches neighbouring houses, and reserved Foncillon beach for women. In 1820, it was forbidden \"to wash pigs, horses and other cattle in the sea as we have baths\". In 1836, a staircase was cut out of the rock to facilitate the landing of passengers from boats. By 1845, civil engineering works by the engineer Botton incorporated the Foncillon cliff into Royan's port. In 1847, the engineer Lessore built the town's first casino. The first street lights were installed in 1854, during a time of considerable development in the town under the Second Empire (1852–1870). Between 1850 and 1870, tourist numbers increased from 9,000 to 10,000, and the population from 3,329 to 4,500.\n\nDuring World War II, two German forts defended the Gironde estuary: Gironde Mündung Nord (to the north, at Royan) and Gironde Mündung Süd (to the south, at La Pointe de Grave). These constituted one of the last pockets of Third Reich resistance along the Atlantic coast of France, well after the liberation of the rest of the country. A force of some 350 heavy bombers of the Royal Air Force (RAF) bombed Royan in two raids conducted in the early hours of January 5, 1945, destroying the town. This was done at the request of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), which had been told that the only people left in Royan were Germans and collaborators. Responsibility for this raid is generally attributed to General de Larminat of the Free French Forces.\n\nThe Allied operation against the German forces on the island of Oléron and at the mouth of the Gironde estuary began with a general naval bombardment on April 15, 1945, some 10 months after D-Day. For five days, the American naval task force assisted the French ground forces with naval bombardment and aerial reconnaissance in the assault on Royan and the Pointe de Grave area at the mouth of the Gironde. American B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator aircraft carried out aerial bombing missions, including extensive and pioneering use of napalm, finishing the destruction of January 5.\n\nThe first bombing raids killed over 1,000 civilians and only 23 German soldiers. When the Americans returned later and used napalm, they destroyed the entire town and killed another 1,700 civilians.\n\nBlandford writes, \"There was a Free French commander with the U.S. Seventh Army outside Royan, who was not informed until too late. The message was in French and the American signalman could not understand it. It took four hours to get it translated\".\n\nHoward Zinn, author of \"A People's History of the United States\", was one of many bombardiers who participated in the World War II attacks on Royan. He later wrote of the bombardment.\n\nThe town was rebuilt as part of an urban development programme in the 1950s, and is representative of the Modernist architecture of the period.\n\nThe men of Royan are known as \"Royannais\", and its women as \"Royannaises\".\n\nRoyan is twinned with:\n\nRoyan's 1877 neo-Gothic church, on what is now the Square Charles de Gaulle, was destroyed when Royan was bombed on January 5, 1945. After the war a new church was built, bigger, architecturally ambitious and spectacular, and drawing its aesthetic inspiration from the large Gothic cathedrals.\n\nNotre-Dame de Royan, completed in 1958 and built entirely of reinforced concrete by architects Guillaume Gillet and Marc Hébrard and engineers Bernard Lafaille, René Sarger and Ou Tseng, is considered a masterpiece of contemporary architecture. The church took three years to build. The elliptical nave is 45 metres long by 22 metres wide () and has a seating capacity for some 2000 people. It is flanked by an ambulatory, and a gallery three metres above the floor. The gallery is lit by rhombus-shaped stained glass representing the Stations of the Cross. The building's structure alternates prestressed V-shaped reinforced concrete elements made using the Lafaille process, named for its inventor, French engineer Bernard Lafaille, with huge windows, made by master glazier Henri Martin-Granel and covering a total area of . The church was classified as a historical monument in 1988.\n\nThe \"Palais des congrès\" was built in 1957 by Bordeaux architect Claude Ferret. Its design is based on cubic geometry, relieved by the oblique lines of external staircases and by the subtle interweaving of convex inner walls. A glass wall opens a broad outlook onto the Gironde estuary, and the building was later extended with gardens under a transparent cube.

During this time they begin to date and their conversations circle around the idea of what love really is, beginning after Saku's grandfather shares his own past love story with Saku.\n\nAfter a trip the two take to an abandoned island, Aki discovers she has leukemia, which limits her chances to go outside or see Saku. Once Saku learns the truth, he buys flight tickets to take Aki to Australia's Uluru (Ayers Rock); a place she had always wanted to visit after missing the school trip there, but she dies before she could board the plane.\n\nThe story takes place as a flashback through Saku's eyes as he and Aki's parents travel to Australia to spread Aki's ashes in the place she had always wanted to see.\n\n\n\"Socrates in Love\" is the English translation of author Katayama's original Japanese title, 恋するソクラテス (\"Koi Suru Sokuratesu\").\n\nThe novel and its manga adaptation (illustrated by Kazumi Kazui) were published in the United States by VIZ Media under the English translated title of author Katayama's original title.\n\nThe 2004 film title, \"Sekai no Chūshin de, Ai o Sakebu\", is abbreviated in Japan as \"Sekachū\" (セカチュー).\n\nTo date, the 2005 Hong Kong DVD release of the 2004 film adaptation is the only English-language release that has its title \"Crying Out Love, In the Center of the World\" in English. The 2004 film and the 2004 TV series still haven't been released to the English-language market outside Hong Kong.\n\nKatayama had intended \"Socrates in Love\" as part of a trilogy to explore the concept and themes of youth and memories. His editors however decided to take advantage of the \"pure Love boom\"—a Japanese media trend of novels and films that portray a chaste, undying and tragic love—by publishing the novel under \"Crying Out Love, in the Center of the World\" to appeal fans of tragic love stories. In spite of this, only 8,000 copies of the book were printed and distributed, due to the poor sales of Katayama's two previous novels.\n\nA year after the novel's publication, celebrity actress Kou Shibasaki wrote in a guest column for Japanese monthly literary and pop culture magazine \"Da Vinci\" (March 2002 issue): \"I read it thoroughly even though it made me cry. I wished to have such a relationship in my life.\" The book became a best-seller, due to Shibasaki's recommendation and the word of mouth. In May 2004 over 3 million copies were sold, surpassing the sales record of Haruki Murakami's \"Norwegian Wood\". Shibasaki subsequently appeared in the 2004 film version.\n\n\"Crying Out Love, In the Center of the World\" was opened nationally in Japan on 8 May 2004, which brought Masami Nagasawa recognition as an actress. It was a huge success, and its theme song, \"Hitomi o Tojite\" (\"With My Eyes Closed\") by Ken Hirai, had record sales as well.\n\n\"Crying out Love, in the Center of the World\" was adapted as an 11-episode TV drama series, directed by Yukihiko Tsutsumi, and broadcast every Friday on TBS at 10PM, from 2 July to 10 September, in 2004.\n\nLike the film, the drama features an original character that doesn't appear in the novel — Aki Kobayashi, a single-mother friend of adult Sakutaro. She has feelings for him, but he struggles not to see her as the late Aki's replacement. Their situation is complicated when Aki's young son sees Saku as a father figure.\n\nThe drama's theme song, \"Katachi Aru Mono\" (Some Kind of Form), is notable for having been written and performed by Kou Shibasaki, who appeared as Ritsuko Fujimura in the 2004 film adaptation.\n\n\n\nThe 2004 film was remade and released in South Korea as \"My Girl and I\" on 23 December 2005. It was then released in Japan on 26 August 2006, under its Japanese title, \"You Are the Center of My World\" (僕の、世界の中心は、君だ \"Boku no, Sekai no Chūshin wa, Kimi da\").\n\n\n"}

It is considered a typical early-World War II production. Originally titled \"The Eagle Squadron\", it is based on a story by \"Melville Crossman\", the pen name for 20th Century Fox studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck. It follows an American pilot who joins the Royal Air Force (RAF), during a period when the United States was still neutral.\n\nIn 1940, American-built North American Harvard training aircraft are flown to the border with Canada, where they are towed across the frontier for use by Britain. (The procedure is necessary to avoid violating the Neutrality Acts, as the United States is still neutral.) Cocky American pilot Tim Baker (Tyrone Power) decides to fly across the border to Trenton, Ontario, and winds up in trouble with the military authorities, unconvincingly claiming he was looking for Trenton, New Jersey. Baker ferries a Lockheed Hudson bomber to Britain, pocketing $1,000 for his work.\n\nIn London, he runs into his on-again off-again girlfriend Carol Brown (Betty Grable), who works in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force by day and stars in a nightclub by night. She is none too pleased to see him, calling him a \"worm\" for his womanizing ways, lying, and long absence, but he is confident she still harbors strong feelings for him.\n\nHe decides to enlist in the Royal Air Force (RAF). Meanwhile, Brown attracts the appreciative attention of two RAF officers, Wing Commander John Morley (John Sutton) and Flying Officer Roger Pillby (Reginald Gardiner). Morley persists in seeing Brown, despite being told at the outset that there is another man. Pillby is unable to persuade either Baker or Morley to introduce him.\n\nAfter completing training, Baker is disappointed to be assigned to Morley's bomber squadron, rather than one equipped with fighters. He becomes further disgruntled when his first mission is to \"bomb\" Berlin with propaganda leaflets as Morley's co-pilot during the Phoney War. Pillby pilots another bomber in the raid.\n\nWhen Baker is late for their date (sidetracked by meeting an old buddy from America), Brown accepts Morley's invitation to spend a weekend at his country estate. There, Morley asks her to marry him. When she tells Baker about it (without revealing who her suitor is), he offers to marry her himself, but in an insultingly casual way. She tells him that they are through. Back at the base, the two rivals learn of each other's involvement with the same woman. Before they can do anything about it, however, the Germans invade the Netherlands and Belgium, and they are given an urgent mission to bomb Dortmund, Germany, this time with real ordnance.\n\nDuring the nighttime raid, their bomber is hit, disabling one of their two engines. Pillby descends to their aid, knocking out searchlights, but is shot down in flames and perishes. Morley orders his crew to bail out, but Baker disobeys and lands the aircraft on a Dutch beach. Spotting a line of advancing German soldiers, they hide in a nearby building, only to be taken prisoner by a German officer there. A crewman sacrifices himself, enabling the other two to dispatch the German and escape by motorboat.\n\nBaker wakes up in a British hospital, the victim of exposure. Once discharged, he goes to see Brown, pretending to have a broken arm, but shows himself to be a liar once more. Nonetheless, he produces an engagement ring and forces it onto her finger. After receiving a telephone call from Morley breaking their date, Brown informs Baker that all leaves have been canceled.\n\nReserves are called up to make up fighter pilot losses, and Baker is reassigned to a Spitfire for the Battle of Dunkirk. He downs two \"Luftwaffe\" fighters before being shot down. Carol cannot hide her distress when she cannot find out whether he is alive or not. Morley takes her to the docks, where ships returning from the Dunkirk beaches are bringing back survivors. When Baker debarks, Carol rushes to him and shows him she is still wearing his ring.\n\nAs appearing in screen credits (main roles identified):\n\nWith principal photography shot from April to July 1941, \"A Yank in the R.A.F.\" leaned heavily on the headline news of the Battle of Britain. The film begins with U.S. North American Harvard trainers arriving at the U.S.|Canada border at the Emerson, Manitoba crossing, as a means of complying with provisions of the Neutrality Acts prohibiting aid to combatants. The depiction of R.C.M.P. and R.C.A.F. officials meeting the aircraft as they were towed across the border, is a bit of Hollywood license, but the incident is otherwise, mainly accurate, albeit usually a team of horses rather than motor vehicles, did the towing.\n\nThe sequence of the Dunkirk evacuation filmed at Point Mugu, California, involved over 1,000 extras. The entire film was shot on Hollywood sound stages, Twentieth Century-Fox back lots and locations in California.\n\nWith complete cooperation from the RAF, as well as extensive use of stock RAF footage, the studio was allowed to film actual aerial battles shot by a camera-equipped aircraft. In the original version of the film, the hero played by Power dies at Dunkirk, but after the RAF expressed concerns that morale would be jeopardized, the scene was re-shot with Baker surviving. Herbert Mason, a recipient of the Military Cross for his gallantry in the Battle of the Somme directed the RAF flying sequences. He was credited as Major Herbert Mason.\n\nIn order to stage some of the airfield scenes, the prop department turned out a group of accurate replica Spitfire and Messerschmitt fighters to go along with actual Lockheed Hudson bombers built in the nearby Lockheed factory at Burbank, California. All the flying sequences were under the direction of long-time Hollywood pilot, Paul Mantz, who used a team of stunt pilots including Frank Clarke.\n\nThe screen credits show \"Tyrone Power with Betty Grable.\" The pairing of Twentieth Century-Fox's two leading stars, as well as cashing into bankable star-power, was considered an opportunity to promote Grable in more serious roles, although \"A Yank in the R.A.F.\" was really a melange of light romantic musical and wartime drama. According to Robert Osborne, Power felt Grable's song-and-dance numbers were out of place in the film, but Grable, believing her popularity was based on her singing, dancing, and bare legs, got her way.\n\nPromoted as a light-hearted look at war, and despite the studio's insistence that it was not a propaganda film, \"A Yank in the R.A.F.\" was able to give prominence to Americans already at war, similar to other films such as Warner Brothers' \"Captains of the Clouds\". The film was also notable in introducing Grable as the pinup favorite to the troops as well as giving her dramatic scenes that expanded her range; a crying scene reportedly took over six hours to film. When released in September 1941, \"A Yank in the R.A.F.\" was a popular film with audiences and critics alike. \"The New York Times\" reviewer Bosley Crowther considered it a, \"... thoroughly enjoyable show ... thrilling\" and filled with \"pulsing action.\"\n\n\"A Yank in the R.A.F.\" was the 4th most popular movie at the US box office in 1941.\n\nContemporary reviewers have been more critical, decrying the unrealistic portrayal of a nation at war. Recent re-releases in video and 2002 DVD have similarly brought negative reviews concerning the content and filmmaker's approach to a serious subject.\n\n\"A Yank in the R.A.F.\" was nominated for the Oscar for Best Special Effects (Fred Sersen, Edmund H. Hansen) at the 14th Academy Awards.\n\n\"A Yank in the R.A.F.\" was released on DVD on May 21, 2002 in the United States and May 3, 2004 in the United Kingdom (followed by another edition on March 12, 2012). It was also released as part of the Tyrone Power Collection box set on September 4, 2006 in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2056447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056447", "title": "Ruf Automobile", "text": "Ruf Automobile\n\nRuf Automobile GmbH is a German car manufacturer that manufactures and engineers original vehicles using unmarked Porsche chassis, specifically known as bodies in white. The cars are built from the ground up as completely new cars, using these bare chassis, and assembled using Ruf-made parts and materials (e.g. BTR, CTR2, RT12), instead of badge engineering or disassembly of existing cars. This means the company is officially recognized as a manufacturer by the German government. As such, all Ruf models have certified Ruf VIN and serial numbers, and are recognized as production models, rather than modified Porsches. Ruf is historically known for its record breaking 211 mph CTR, and is the largest, most renowned company to make Porsche performance enhancements. Though primarily a manufacturer, Ruf has also made a name for itself operating as a car tuner, a specialist in customer-requested Porsche-to-Ruf conversions (e.g. Turbo R conversions), and a restorer of classic Porsche and Ruf models. Ruf carries out service and crash repair, as well.\n\nRuf Automobile GmbH operated as a car manufacturer and a car tuner at the same time for some model. For example the famous CTR (1987–1996) was manufactured only 29 times from bodies in white, at the same time about 20-30 cars were built from customers' cars. To distinguish between manufactured cars and tuned cars is possible to look at the VIN. RUF VIN starts with \"W09\", Porsche VIN starts with \"WP\".\n\nThe company was founded in 1939 in Pfaffenhausen, Germany as \"Auto Ruf\" by Alois Ruf Sr. as a service garage and was eventually expanded to include a full-service gas station in 1949. Ruf began experimenting with vehicle designs of his own in the late 1940s, and in 1955 designed and built a tour bus, which he marketed around Germany. The positive response it received led to Ruf expanding his business again by starting his own separately owned bus company.\n\nAlois Sr.'s involvement in the car industry had a distinct effect on his son, Alois Ruf Jr., who became a sports car enthusiast. In 1960, Alois Jr. began servicing and restoring Porsche automobiles out of his father's garage. Following Alois Sr's. death in 1974, 24-year-old Alois Jr. took control of the business and focused on his passion: Porsche vehicles, and especially the 911. A year later in 1975, the first Ruf-enhanced Porsche came to life.\n\nRuf debuted their first complete model in 1977, a tuned version of Porsche's 930 with a stroked 3.3 litre motor. This was followed in 1978 by Ruf's first complete non-turbo Porsche, the 911 SCR. It was a naturally aspirated 911 with a stroked 3.2 litre motor producing 217 horsepower. Numerous customer orders were placed for this vehicle.\n\nIn the years since, the company has made a major mark on the automotive world by producing exceptionally powerful and exclusive Porsche-based production models. The 1987 Ruf CTR achieved a top speed of in April 1987 and set the record as the world's fastest production car for its time; in 1988 it even reached . Its successor, the 1995 Ruf CTR2, had clocked a top speed of , making it for a brief moment the fastest road-legal production car in the world in the mid '90s, until the McLaren F1 broke the record in 1998 at 241 mph, thus making the CTR2 as the 2nd fastest production car of the decade. However, the CTR2 cost only a fraction of the price of the F1.\n\nIn April 2007, Ruf released the new CTR3 to celebrate the company's new plant in Bahrain, and as a 20th anniversary celebration of the original CTR and successor to the CTR2. At the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, Ruf also showcased the RGT-8, the first production V8-powered 911 in history.\n\nPlease be aware that this table is still incomplete.\n\nThe eRuf Model A is an all-electric sports car made by Ruf Automobile. The car is powered by UQM Technologies propulsion system (a UQM PowerPhase 150). The car has a top speed of and it's capable of producing and of torque. Estimated range per charge is , depending on performance level, using iron-phosphate, lithium-ion batteries built by Axeon of Great Britain. The power and torque produced by the 3-phase motor can be used to recover almost as much power as it can put out. During coasting the engine works as a generator producing electricity to charge the batteries. Ruf announced that it hoped to begin production of the eRuf in the fall of 2009. This did not happen, and at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show, Ruf announced a new model, the eRUF Greenster, with limited production planned to commence at the end of 2010.\n\nRuf models have historically appeared in many large racing and driving video games franchises in place of the Porsche models they are based on due to Porsche's exclusive licensing in video games. Starting with the release of \"\" in 2000, Porsche had an exclusive licensing deal with Electronic Arts (EA) that said Porsche models would only appear in EA games, most notably, the \"Need for Speed\" franchise as well as the \"Real Racing\" series. The only exceptions to this were Turn 10 Studios, the creators of the \"Forza\" series of games, who were able to negotiate some sub licensing deals for Porsche models to appear in DLC and expansion packs for some of their games, including \"Forza Motorsport 3\" and \"4\" and \"Forza Horizon 2\"., and Bizarre Creations, and their first two Project Gotham Racing titles, Project Gotham Racing, and Project Gotham Racing 2. Other large video game franchises, however, including \"Gran Turismo\", \"Project CARS\", \"Assetto Corsa\", \"Asphalt\", \"Test Drive\", \"The Crew\", \"\", \"Driveclub\" and many of the \"Forza\" games used Ruf models in their video games in place of the Porsche models they are based on as they are usually very similar visually. This goes around Porsche's licensing as Ruf is considered by the German government to be a full fledged manufacturer, and as such Ruf models have unique VINs. The exclusivity deal between Porsche and EA, however, ended in 2016 leading many franchises to replace Ruf models with similar Porsche models.\n\n"}

The 1797 officer's quarters was renovated in the 1930s and now house the museum with exhibits about the fort's history and historic artifacts from the area.\n\nA trail runs along the fort's earthen walls, and provides a view of the Annapolis River and basin.\n\nThe site has been fortified since 1629, when the Scots came to colonize Nova Scotia (New Scotland) and built Charles Fort. The region was reverted to French control in the 1630s and Charles de Menou d'Aulnay began work on the first of four forts on the same site, then known as Port Royal. In 1702, the French began construction of the current Vauban earthwork that is found there today.\n\nDuring Queen Anne's War, the fort fell to British and New England troops after a week-long siege in 1710 which marked the British conquest of Acadia. A British governor and garrison replaced the French at the fort renaming the Port Royal settlement Annapolis Royal after Queen Anne. With the Treaty of Utrecht three years later, the British gained full control of mainland Nova Scotia and kept Annapolis Royal as the capital until the founding of Halifax in 1749. The 40th Regiment of Foot was raised at Fort Anne in 1717.\n\nDuring Father Rale's War, in July 1722 the Abenaki and Mi'kmaq attempted to create a blockade of Annapolis Royal, with the intent of starving the capital. The natives captured 18 fishing vessels and prisoners from present-day Yarmouth to Canso. They also seized prisoners and vessels from the Bay of Fundy.\n\nIn response to the New England attack on Father Rale at Norridgewock in March 1722, 165 Mi'kmaq and Maliseet troops gathered at Minas to lay siege to the Lt. Governor of Nova Scotia at Annapolis Royal. Under potential siege, in May 1722, Lieutenant Governor John Doucett took 22 Mi'kmaq hostage at Annapolis Royal to prevent the capital from being attacked. Massachusetts Governor Samuel Shute declared war on the Abenaki.\n\nNew Englanders retrieved some of the vessels and prisoners after the Battle at Winnepang (Jeddore Harbour) in which thirty-five natives and five New-Englanders were killed. Other vessels and prisoners were retrieved at Malagash Harbour after a ransom was paid.\n\nDuring Father Rale's War, the worst moment of the war for the capital came in early July 1724 when a group of sixty Mikmaq and Maliseets raided Annapolis Royal. They killed and scalped a sergeant and a private, wounded four more soldiers, and terrorized the village. They also burned houses and took prisoners. The British responded on July 8 by executing one of the Mi'kmaq hostages on the same spot the sergeant was killed. They also burned three Acadian houses in retaliation.\n\nAs a result of the raid, three blockhouses were built to protect the town. The Acadian church was moved closer to the fort so that it could be more easily monitored.\n\nDuring King George's War, the French launched three expeditions against the capital to regain the fort with no success, the most famous being the Duc d'Anville Expedition.\n\nDuring Father Le Loutre's War, the capital of Acadia was moved from Annapolis Royal to Halifax. Fort Edward, Fort Lawrence and Fort Anne were all supplied by and dependent on the arrival of Captains Cobb, Rogers or Taggart, in one of the government sloops. These vessels took the annual or semi-annual relief to their destination. They carried the officers and their families to and fro, as required.\n\nDuring the French and Indian War, the British engaged in the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755) and deported the Acadians living in the area. With the fall of Quebec in 1759, the fort no longer held the same military importance.\n\nIt was however still used as an outpost during the American Revolution, where the 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants) was stationed, and the War of 1812 in defence of the town from American privateers.\n\nThe fort acquired the name Fort Anne in the 19th century.\n\n\nIn 1917, Fort Anne was acquired by the Dominion Parks Branch, the predecessor of Parks Canada, and designated the second national historic park, bearing the name Fort Anne National Park (Fort Howe in Saint John, New Brunswick had been the first historical park). Two years later, a new program of National Historic Sites was established in 1919 to replace the incipient system of historic parks, and Fort Anne was designated a National Historic Site in 1920.\n\nAlthough Fort Anne was neither the first National Historic Park (Fort Howe was designated three years earlier), nor was it the first site designated under the replacement National Historic Site program, it is nonetheless sometimes referred to as Canada's \"first national historic site\" or the \"first administered national historic site\", because it was the first site acquired by the federal government for national historic purposes that has subsequently remained under Parks Canada administration (Fort Howe was eventually conveyed to the municipality).\n\nOn 28 June 1985 Canada Post issued 'Fort Anne, N.S., circa 1763.' one of the 20 stamps in the \"Forts Across Canada Series\" (1983 & 1985). The stamps are perforated 12½ x 13 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited based on the designs by Rolf P. Harder.\n\n\n\n"}

Conley authored a low-fat diet and exercise programme, \"The Hip & Thigh Diet\" in 1988, which sold more than two million copies. However, her spot theory of fat reduction which claims people can lose fat specifically from the hips and thighs has no scientific basis.\n\nConley attended Bushloe High School in Leicestershire and Goddards Secretarial College in Leicester. She then studied for an RSA in Exercise to Music.\n\nAfter losing weight herself, Conley began by running evening classes for local women looking to lose weight in 1972, under the name the \"Slimming & Good Grooming Club\". She established a number of slimming clubs, which she later sold to IPC for £50,000, working for the company to oversee the expansion of the club network. After suffering from gallstones, she adopted a low-fat diet as an alternative to surgery, and the resulting fat-loss inspired her to promote the diet to others. In 1996, the Rosemary Conley Diet & Fitness magazine was launched. The publication won many awards and had more than half a million readers becoming market leader in its sector after just three issues. From 1996 to 2000 Conley was a consultant to Marks & Spencer and helped them to develop their low fat, calorie-controlled food range.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2014 she was the founder and president of Rosemary Conley Diet And Fitness Clubs, a franchise-based weight-loss organisation. From 2015 - 2019 she was the Chairman of Digital Wellbeing Ltd, parent company of Rosemary Online, an online weight loss club and from 2018 has been the UK distributor for Facial-Flex, a facial exercising device.\n\nConley became internationally famous in 1988 via her book \"The Hip & Thigh Diet\", which went on to sell over two million copies. The Rosemary Conley approach is characterised by a low-fat diet regime, but what distinguished the organisation from its competitors is that the classes also offered a 45-minute aerobic workout with a trained instructor. Thus it provided a fitness club for people wanting an alternative to gym membership rather than simply another club for dieters, although there were similar product endorsements of foods and kitchen equipment. The franchise expanded to 180 clubs by 2004, with 80,000 members. \n\nConley's \"The Hip and Thigh Diet\" is a low-fat spot-reducing diet and exercise programme that promoted the idea that it could help people lose fat from the hips and thighs. However, medical experts do not believe that \"this or any other diet and exercise programme can help you shed fat from some parts of your body but not others.\" The idea has been disproven by scientific research as studies have confirmed that \"it is not possible to manipulate diet or use exercise to lose fat from specific parts of the body.\"\n\nIn Conley's 1993 book \"The Complete Hip and Thigh Diet\", she promoted the idea of anatomically selective weight loss by dieting. Professor of Surgery Henry Buchwald and colleagues noted that \"there is no known basis in this book or elsewhere for the support of this incredible claim.\" Dietician Catherine Saxelby has described the \"Hip and Thigh Diet\" as a fad diet.\n\nIn 1999, Conley was appointed as deputy lieutenant of Leicestershire. In 2001, she became the first woman to be granted the Freedom of the City of Leicester. She was appointed a CBE in 2004.\n\n"}
{"id": "2056466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056466", "title": "The Animal", "text": "The Animal\n\nThe Animal is a 2001 American comedy film directed by Luke Greenfield and starring Rob Schneider, Colleen Haskell, John C. McGinley, Guy Torry, and Edward Asner. Schneider plays Marvin Mange, a man who is critically injured but unknown to him he is put back together by a mad scientist who transplants animal parts, resulting in strange permanent changes to his behavior.\n\nIn the town of Elkerton, Marvin Mange (Rob Schneider) is an awkward, clumsy nice-guy who dreams of being a police officer like his dad was. He continuously attempts to pass the physical test to become a full-fledged police officer, but despite his repeated attempts, he is unable to finish the obstacle course. Marvin gets constantly mistreated by heartless and sleazy Sgt. Doug Sisk (John C. McGinley). He works in the police station as an evidence clerk and is friends with security guard Miles (Guy Torry) and fellow cadet Fatty (Louis Lombardi).\n\nOne day, while alone at the station, he receives a robbery call. With no other officers responding to the call, he attempts to take it himself but ends up driving off the road, tumbling down a mountain and seriously injuring himself. Just as the car finally comes to a stop, a boulder falls on top of it and he passes out.\n\nDays later, Marvin returns to his normal life with no memory of what had happened. Suddenly, he's full of life. He can outrun horses, mean dogs are now scared of him, and he does not need his asthma medicine. He thinks it is due to his late-night TV purchase of \"Badger Milk\", which is guaranteed in the ads to make him stronger.\n\nOne day at the park, Marvin meets Rianna (Colleen Haskell) while she's out walking her dogs. His animal-like tendencies are slowly taking him over. When a frisbee is thrown in his direction, he cannot control himself, and he jumps to catch it in his mouth.\n\nHe goes to the airport to talk to Miles about his problem. While there, Marvin sniffs out a man trying to hide heroin in his rectum. For uncovering a drug smuggler, Marvin is declared a hero and is made a full-fledged police officer.\n\nAs days go by, Marvin's animal instincts are becoming stronger. He often wakes up in strange places, and subsequently, hears about animal attacks that occurred in the middle of the night. Because of these attacks, Dr. Wilder (Michael Caton) believes that Marvin is out of control. The mad scientist confronts him, takes him to his laboratory, and explains about the grafts and transplants that saved Marvin's life and gave him remarkable animal powers with certain troublesome side effects.\n\nLater at a party thrown by the Mayor (Scott Wilson), Marvin chases after a cat and destroys everything around him and gets fired as a result. During his reprimand, he hears something, jumps into the nearby lake and rescues the mayor's son (Bret Smrz) using powers derived from a sea lion and a dolphin. He is swiftly reinstated.\n\nChief Wilson (Edward Asner) questions Marvin about the late-night attacks on farm animals because one of the witnesses made a police sketch, and it looks like Marvin.\n\nRianna goes to Marvin's house, where he has barricaded himself inside. They spend the night together, but Marvin wants to be tied up so he cannot hurt anyone. In the morning, he finds himself untied, courtesy of Rianna. Suddenly, the police show up outside. Another attack had happened that night, and the police have come for Marvin. Rianna convinces him to run.\n\nMarvin escapes to the woods, where a huge chase ensues; the police have organized an angry mob as a search party to capture Marvin. While running through the woods, Marvin finds Dr. Wilder. The scientist tells him that there was another \"patient\" of his that is out of control, and he is in the woods looking for it.\n\nSergeant Sisk confronts Marvin and is about to shoot him. Suddenly, the other \"animal\" jumps from a tree and attacks Sisk. The beast is Rianna. Now, the crowd finds them both together but Miles is there and takes the blame for everything. He has been claiming that there is reverse racism towards him since he's black (a concept he explained in the beginning of the movie while out to eat with Marvin) and no one wants to hold him accountable for anything. Sure enough, once the mob thinks a black man was responsible, they don't care anymore and leave.\n\nMarvin and Rianna get married and have a litter of children that each look like Marvin. While watching television, they see Dr. Wilder win the Nobel Prize. He says he owes it all to his fiancée, who is the same woman from the Badger Milk commercial. When she turns around to kiss him, there are large scars shown on her back, implying that Wilder performed the experiment on her as well.\n\n\nWes Takahashi, former animator and visual effects supervisor for Industrial Light & Magic, makes a cameo appearance as a news reporter. Fred Stoller also cameos as a news reporter.\n\n\"The Animal\" debuted on June 1, 2001, grossing $19.6 million U.S. in its opening weekend. With a production budget of $47 million, the movie grossed $84,772,742 internationally.\n\nThis film received negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 30% based on 83 reviews, with its consensus stating: \"While less offensive and more charming than recent gross-humored comedies, \"The Animal\" is still rather mediocre\". Metacritic gave the film a score of 43% based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+.\n\nKevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it \"An outrageous and imaginative summer comedy.\"\nRobert Koehler of \"Variety magazine\" wrote: \"The Animal is never more nor less than stupid, but stupid in ways that deliver goofiness rather than rampant humiliation.\"\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" described it as \"an Adam Sandler reject\" and wondered how this \"raunchy innuendo wrapped in a PG-13 rating\" got past the censors.\nRob Schneider was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Actor of the Decade for his performance in the film.\n\nDespite receiving mostly negative critical reaction, one supporter of the film at the time of its release was film critic David Manning who gave the film critical praise. In late 2001, Manning was revealed to be a fictitious character created by Sony to fake publicity for the film. At the time, Sony claimed that the error was due to a layout artist who entered 'dummy text' into print advertisements during their design, which was accidentally never replaced with real text.\n\n"}
{"id": "2056480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056480", "title": "See No Evil, Hear No Evil", "text": "See No Evil, Hear No Evil\n\nSee No Evil, Hear No Evil is a 1989 American comedy film directed by Arthur Hiller. The film stars Richard Pryor as a blind man and Gene Wilder as a deaf man who work together to thwart a trio of murderous thieves. This is the third film featuring Wilder and Pryor, who had appeared previously in the 1976 film \"Silver Streak\" and the 1980 film \"Stir Crazy\". The film was released in the United States on May 12, 1989.\n\nWally Karew (Richard Pryor), a blind man, and Dave Lyons (Gene Wilder), a deaf man, meet when Wally applies for a job in Dave's New York City concession shop.\n\nAfter a brief period of confusion and antagonism, Wally and Dave become close friends. Dave reads lips and guides Wally when they travel, and Wally tells Dave about invisible sources of sound and what people say behind his back. At a local bar, Wally defeats an aggressive bully in a fistfight with assistance from Dave, who uses clock-face directions to tell Wally where his opponent is. Dave hires Wally.\n\nOne morning, as Wally waits outside for the day's newspapers, a man walks into Dave's shop. When the man is approached by a beautiful woman named Eve (Joan Severance), he quickly removes a gold coin from a suitcase and places it in a box of coins sitting on the counter. The woman takes the suitcase and shoots the man in the stomach as Dave - whose back is turned - reads the information on a box of antacid pills. Dave neither sees nor hears the shooting, but he notices Eve's legs as she leaves the shop. Wally, who heard the gunshot, walks into the shop and trips over the man's dead body. Dave then rushes to help Wally and picks up the gun, which Eve left at the scene. When the police arrive, they find Dave and Wally standing over the body with Dave holding the gun. Before they are arrested, Dave tells Wally to collect the coins from the box.\n\nAt the police station, Dave and Wally are interrogated by Captain Braddock (Alan North), a detective who immediately takes a dislike to them and makes them his prime suspects due to their relative uselessness as witnesses. When Eve and her accomplice Kirgo (Kevin Spacey) - hoping to recover the coin - arrive to bail them out by posing as attorneys, Wally recognizes Eve's perfume and Dave recognizes her legs, but Braddock ignores them when they insist that she is the killer. Wishing to avoid Eve and Kirgo when they are released, Dave and Wally escape from the police station, but the criminals soon find them. Eve takes the coin from Wally's pocket and telephones her boss Mr. Sutherland (Anthony Zerbe) for instructions, allowing Dave to learn the criminals' plans by reading her lips. When Kirgo tries to kill Dave and Wally, they use the fistfighting method they learned in the bar to knock him unconscious. They then steal an unattended police car, and drive away with Eve, Kirgo and Braddock chasing them. Working together to guide the patrol car, Dave and Wally evade both the police and the criminals, but they accidentally launch the car onto a waterborne garbage barge.\n\nAfter hiding the police car, the two men walk to a motel and telephone Wally's sister Adele (Kirsten Childs) for help. The police follow Adele and search her motel room, but she, Wally, and Dave avoid detection, and they drive away after the police have left. Having incorrectly read Eve's lips, Dave believes they need to find a woman named \"Grace George\", but Adele realizes that Eve must have been referring to a resort called \"Great Gorge\". At the resort, before Wally impersonates a visiting professor while Dave steals the coin from Eve. Meanwhile, Adele distracts Kirgo by crashing her car into his. However, Kirgo and Eve kidnap Adele and take her to Sutherland's estate.\n\nAfter a tragic mishap with the car, Dave and Wally put their rescue plan into action, with the result that Adele escapes but the two men are captured. In his study, Sutherland – who is also blind – reveals that the coin is a room-temperature superconductor, which is extremely valuable. Kirgo and Sutherland are killed during an argument over sharing the profits from the coin's theft, after which Dave and Wally escape the study and have a violent altercation with Eve and her helicopter pilot. When the police arrive, the remaining criminals are arrested, and Wally and Dave are released having been cleared of the charges. Shortly thereafter, the two men go to a local park and reprise a scene from the beginning of the film by dumping ice-cream cones on each other's head, enjoying each other's company.\n\n\nTriStar Pictures was looking to produce another film starring Wilder and Pryor, but Wilder would only agree to do \"See No Evil, Hear No Evil\" if he was allowed to re-write the script. The studio agreed and \"See No Evil, Hear No Evil\" premiered in May 1989 to mostly negative reviews. Many critics praised Wilder's, Pryor's, and Kevin Spacey's performances, but they mostly agreed that the script was absolutely terrible. Roger Ebert called it \"a real dud\", the \"Deseret Morning News \"described the film as \"stupid\", with an \"idiotic script\" that had a \"contrived story\" and too many \"juvenile gags.\" On the other hand Vincent Canby called it \"by far the most successful co-starring vehicle for Mr. Pryor and Mr. Wilder\", while also acknowledging that \"this is not elegant movie making, and not all of the gags are equally clever.\"\n\nThe film holds a 28% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 29 critics. Despite the negative reviews, the film was a box office success for its time, able to stay at number one for two weeks.\n\n\n"}

Hines and Crystal play Chicago police officers who, after nearly being killed on the job, decide to retire and open a bar in Key West, Florida, only to get caught up in making one last arrest before they go.\n\nThe film was produced and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nRay Hughes (Hines) and Danny Costanzo (Crystal) are two police officers working on Chicago's North Side, known for their wisecracking demeanors and unorthodox police methods, which get results in their various cases. One such case involves trying to bust up-and-coming drug dealer Julio Gonzales (Jimmy Smits). After arresting Snake (Joe Pantoliano), one of Julio's associates, they convince him to wear a wire in order to get the necessary evidence to put Julio away. When they approach the meeting place (a cargo ship) they find that Gonzales has acquired a large store of Israeli Uzi submachine guns. Snake is setting the detectives up, however, prompting the detectives to rush in by acting as though Gonzales was preparing to kill him. Gonzales reveals his ambition to be the next \"godfather\" of Chicago, but chastises Snake for letting the detectives get close, and Snake is shot dead by a subordinate. The pair look as though they will be killed for sure, but two undercover detectives in Julio's gang step in to make the arrest. In the ensuing gun battle, most of Julio's gang escape, but Ray and Danny capture Gonzales.\n\nBack at the station Ray and Danny expect to be praised, but instead their captain (Dan Hedaya) chastises them for their sloppy work (as revealed by Snake's wire) and orders them to take a vacation. On vacation in Key West, Florida, the pair begin to question their career choice after the experience and decide to retire and open a bar.\n\nWhen they return to Chicago and inform the captain of their intentions, they find out that Gonzales has been released and is free on bail. Incensed, they vow to capture Gonzales before retiring, but by being a little more careful in the process. To add insult to injury, Captain Logan assigns them the additional task of training their replacements before they go. They must train detectives Anthony Montoya (Jon Gries) and Frank Sigliano (Steven Bauer), none other than the two undercover officers that saved them from being killed in the Gonzales bust. Logan wants the replacements to be \"the best of the worst\" and orders them never to let him catch them doing anything Ray and Danny teaches them.\n\nDuring one of the attempts to capture Gonzales, Ray and Danny confiscate a large shipment of cocaine coming from Colombia. In order to get them back, Gonzales kidnaps Danny's ex-wife Anna (Darlanne Fluegel), whom he still loves and has been trying to reconcile with, and says he will trade her for his drugs; otherwise, he will kill her. Danny agrees, leading to the final confrontation inside the high-rise atrium of the James R. Thompson Center. During the ensuing fight, Danny and Ray rescue their would-be protégés in a way similar to their own rescuing, and Gonzales is killed. Anna and Danny reconcile and he and Ray decide not to retire after all.\n\n\nHyams later recalled, after \"2010\" he wanted \"to remain earthbound\". He wanted to do \"a comedy that was not stupid, and a film that had action in it, but a film where the action was not mean-spirited or bloody or graphic.\"\n\nMGM came to him with a script about two elderly cops in New York who retire. He wanted to make it about two young cops in Chicago who did not retire. Hymans thought this \"opened up a set of casting possibilities to me that were fresh\" and \"gave a chance visually to use a city that is not used as much\".\n\n\"There were a lot of cop movies around at that time, so I decided that if I wanted to be interesting I needed to do it with two actors you would not normally expect to see in an action movie,\" said Hyams. \"So I wanted Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines, and I got them and they were wonderful together. They just clicked.\n\nHines did an \"Amazing Stories\" with Hyams. \"I just campaigned and campaigned for it until I got it,\" said Hines. And I'm proud because this is the first film that stars a black guy and a white guy - and the black guy has all the sex scenes. Of course, the part was to have been played by a white guy. But, still, those scenes are still in the movie. Usually, the black guy has no sexuality at all. \"\n\nThe movie was filmed in September 1985. There was six weeks of filming in MGM's Studios plus location work in Key West and Chicago.\n\n\"Hyams was tough to work with,\" said Hines. \"But I don't want to put the guy down.\"\n\nCrystal said \" I contributed what I hope are little pearls throughout the piece. Peter Hyams... wanted me in the part because he felt I was the kind of writer/performer who could help the script at certain moments because I improvise a lot. So I got very involved. I would improvise during rehearsal and then sometimes I did it during a take, which gets even more dangerous. And you can't do those kinds of things unless you have an actor like Gregory Hines who is there to catch you. To hold you at that particular moment.\"\n\n\"Running Scared\" was a moderate box office success, earning over $38 million. Reviews were mixed, however, and the film has a current 60% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 20 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert recommended it, saying that the film \"transcends its dreary roots and turns out to be a lot of fun\".\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\", however, advised people to \"stay home and watch \"Miami Vice\" or \"Cagney and Lacey\"\" instead.\n\nThe film debuted at #5 at the U.S. box office, with a weekend gross of $5,227,757.\n\nThe \"Running Scared\" soundtrack was released in conjunction with the movie and contained a mix of songs and music featured in the film.

A band of 9,000 pro-Union Native Americans was forced to flee to Kansas in bitter cold and snow in what became known as the Trail of Blood on Ice.\n\nConfederate troops undertook a campaign to subdue the Native American Union sympathizers in Indian Territory and consolidate control. They attacked Chief Opothleyahola's band of Creek and Seminole (led by Chief Halek Tustenuggee) at Round Mountain and Chusto-Talasah. The Confederates wanted to finish off the Indians by attacking them in their camp at \"Chustenahlah\" (corruption of the Cherokee word \"\"U-s-ta-la-na\",\" meaning a shoal or sandbar in a stream or creek) in a well-protected cove on Bird Creek. Colonel James M. McIntosh and Col. Douglas H. Cooper, commanding the Indian Department, planned a combined attack with each of their columns moving on the camp from different directions. McIntosh left Fort Gibson on December 22, with 1,380 men.\n\nOn December 25, McIntosh was told that Cooper’s force could not join him for a while, but he decided to attack the next day, despite being outnumbered and facing severe cold weather conditions. McIntosh attacked the camp at noon. The 1,700 pro-Union defenders were secluded in the underbrush along the slope of a rugged hill. McIntosh devised a plan to converge on the crest, with the South Kansas-Texas Cavalry (also known as the 3rd Texas) ordered to charge directly up the steep bluff on foot. The 11th Texas advanced to their left using a defile for concealment, while the 6th Texas circled to the right. As the Confederate attack progressed, the Native Americans began to fall back, taking cover for a while and moving back. The retreat became a rout as the Federals reached their camp. The pro-Union Native Americans tried to defend their position but were forced away again by 4:00 p.m.\n\nThe survivors fled; many went all the way to Kansas where they found loyal Unionists. Col. Stand Watie, with 300 Cherokee fighting for the Confederacy, intercepted the fleeing Creek and Seminole, killing 15. Chief Opothleyahola’s band mounted no further resistance after this encounter. The Confederates followed no further. The remaining Union fighters and their families trekked to Fort Row, Kansas, deprived of many of their provisions due to their being forced to flee in haste. Nearly 2,000 died at or shortly after their arrival, due mostly to exposure and disease.\n\nThe victorious Confederates captured 160 women and children, 20 blacks, 30 wagons, 70 yoke of oxen, about 500 Indian horses, several hundred head of cattle, 100 sheep, and large quantities of supplies. Casualties were 9 killed and 40 wounded for the Confederates. Col. McIntosh in his official report estimated the Union Indians' loss as 250.\n\n\n\"McIntosh's Brigade\" (Confederate) – Col.

SSR is based on the military identification friend or foe (IFF) technology originally developed during World War II, therefore the two systems are still compatible. Monopulse secondary surveillance radar (MSSR), Mode S, TCAS and ADS-B are similar modern methods of secondary surveillance.\n\nThe rapid wartime development of radar had obvious applications for air traffic control (ATC) as a means of providing continuous surveillance of air traffic disposition. Precise knowledge of the positions of aircraft would permit a reduction in the normal procedural separation standards, which in turn promised considerable increases in the efficiency of the airways system. This type of radar (now called a \"primary radar\") can detect and report the position of anything that reflects its transmitted radio signals including, depending on its design, aircraft, birds, weather and land features. For air traffic control purposes this is both an advantage and a disadvantage. Its targets do not have to co-operate, they only have to be within its coverage and be able to reflect radio waves, but it only indicates the position of the targets, it does not identify them. When primary radar was the only type of radar available, the correlation of individual radar returns with specific aircraft typically was achieved by the controller observing a directed turn by the aircraft. Primary radar is still used by ATC today as a backup/complementary system to secondary radar, although its coverage and information is more limited.\n\nThe need to be able to identify aircraft more easily and reliably led to another wartime radar development, the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, which had been created as a means of positively identifying friendly aircraft from unknowns. This system, which became known in civil use as secondary surveillance radar (SSR), or in the US as the air traffic control radar beacon system (ATCRBS), relies on a piece of equipment aboard the aircraft known as a \"transponder.\" The transponder is a radio receiver and transmitter pair which receives on 1030 MHz and transmits on 1090 MHz. The target aircraft transponder replies to signals from an interrogator (usually, but not necessarily, a ground station co-located with a primary radar) by transmitting a coded reply signal containing the requested information.\nBoth the civilian SSR and the military IFF have become much more complex than their war-time ancestors, but remain compatible with each other, not least to allow military aircraft to operate in civil airspace. Today's SSR can provide much more detailed information, for example, the aircraft altitude, as well as enabling the direct exchange of data between aircraft for collision avoidance. Most SSR systems rely on Mode C transponders, which report the aircraft pressure altitude. The pressure altitude is independent from the pilot's altimeter setting, thus preventing false altitude transmissions if altimeter is adjusted incorrectly. Air traffic control systems recalculate reported pressure altitudes to true altitudes based on their own pressure references, if necessary.\n\nGiven its primary military role of reliably identifying friends, IFF has much more secure (encrypted) messages to prevent \"spoofing\" by the enemy, and is used on many types of military platforms including air, sea and land vehicles.\n\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is a branch of the United Nations and its headquarters are in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It publishes annexes to the Convention and Annex 10 addresses Standards and Recommended Practices for Aeronautical Telecommunications. The objective is to ensure that aircraft crossing international boundaries are compatible with the Air Traffic Control systems in all countries that may be visited. Volume III, Part 1 is concerned with digital data communication systems including the data link functions of Mode S while volume IV defines its operation and signals in space.\n\nThe American Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) and the European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment (Eurocae) produce \"Minimum Operational Performance Standards\" for both ground and airborne equipment in accordance with the standards specified in ICAO Annex 10. Both organisations frequently work together and produce common documents.\n\nARINC (Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated) is an airline run organisation concerned with the form, fit and function of equipment carried in aircraft. Its main purpose is to ensure competition between manufacturers by specifying the size, power requirements, interfaces and performance of equipment to be located in the equipment bay of the aircraft.\n\nThe purpose of SSR is to improve the ability to detect and identify aircraft while automatically providing the Flight Level (pressure altitude) of an aircraft. An SSR ground station transmits interrogation pulses on 1030 MHz (continuously in Modes A, C and selectively, in Mode S) as its antenna rotates, or is electronically scanned, in space. An aircraft transponder within line-of-sight range 'listens' for the SSR interrogation signal and transmits a reply on 1090 MHz that provides aircraft information. The reply sent depends on the interrogation mode. The aircraft is displayed as a tagged icon on the controller's radar screen at the measured bearing and range. An aircraft without an operating transponder still may be observed by primary radar, but would be displayed to the controller without the benefit of SSR derived data. It is typically a requirement to have a working transponder in order to fly in controlled air space and many aircraft have a back-up transponder to ensure that condition is met.\n\nThere are several modes of interrogation, each indicated by the difference in spacing between two transmitter pulses, known as P1 and P3. Each mode produces a different response from the aircraft. A third pulse, P2, is for side lobe suppression and is described later. Not included are additional military (or IFF) modes, which are described in Identification Friend or Foe.\n\nA mode-A interrogation elicits a 12-pulse reply, indicating an identity number associated with that aircraft. The 12 data pulses are bracketed by two framing pulses, F1 and F2. The X pulse is not used. A mode-C interrogation produces an 11-pulse response (pulse D1 is not used), indicating aircraft altitude as indicated by its altimeter in 100-foot increments. Mode B gave a similar response to mode A and was at one time used in Australia. Mode D has never been used operationally.\n\nThe new mode, Mode S, has different interrogation characteristics. It comprises pulses P1 and P2 from the antenna main beam to ensure that Mode-A and Mode-C transponders do not reply, followed by a long phase-modulated pulse.\n\nThe ground antenna is highly directional but cannot be designed without sidelobes. Aircraft could also detect interrogations coming from these sidelobes and reply appropriately. However these replies can not be differentiated from the intended replies from the main beam and can give rise to a false aircraft indication at an erroneous bearing. To overcome this problem the ground antenna is provided with a second, mainly omni-directional, beam with a gain which exceeds that of the sidelobes but not that of the main beam. A third pulse, P2, is transmitted from this second beam 2 µs after P1. An aircraft detecting P2 stronger than P1 (therefore in the sidelobe and at the incorrect main lobe bearing), does not reply.\n\nA number of problems are described in an ICAO publication of 1983 entitled \"Secondary Surveillance Radar Mode S Advisory Circular\".\n\nAlthough 4,096 different identity codes available in a mode A reply may seem enough, once particular codes have been reserved for emergency and other purposes, the number is significantly reduced. Ideally an aircraft would keep the same code from take-off until landing even when crossing international boundaries, as it is used at the air traffic control centre to display the aircraft's callsign using a process known as code/callsign conversion. Clearly the same mode A code should not be given to two aircraft at the same time as the controller on the ground could be given the wrong callsign with which to communicate with the aircraft.\n\nThe mode C reply provides height increments of 100 feet, which was initially adequate for monitoring aircraft separated by at least 1000 feet. However, as airspace became increasingly congested, it became important to monitor whether aircraft were not moving out of their assigned flight level. A slight change of a few feet could cross a threshold and be indicated as the next increment up and a change of 100 feet. Smaller increments were desirable.\n\nSince all aircraft reply on the same frequency of 1090 MHz, a ground station will also receive aircraft replies originating from responses to other ground stations. These unwanted replies are known as FRUIT (False Replies Unsynchronized with Interrogator Transmissions or alternatively False Replies Unsynchronized In Time). Several successive FRUIT replies could combine and appear to indicate an aircraft which does not exist. As air transport expands and more aircraft occupy the airspace, the amount of FRUIT generated will also increase.\n\nFRUIT replies can overlap with wanted replies at a ground receiver, thus causing errors in extracting the included data. A solution is to increase the interrogation rate so as to receive more replies, in the hope that some would be clear of interference. The process is self-defeating as increasing the reply rate only increases the interference to other users and vice versa.\n\nIf two aircraft paths cross within about two miles slant range from the ground interrogator, their replies will overlap and the interference caused will make their detection difficult. Typically the controller will lose the longer range aircraft, just when the controller may be most interested in monitoring them closely.\n\nWhile an aircraft is replying to one ground interrogation it is unable to respond to another interrogation, reducing detection efficiency. For a Mode A or C interrogation the transponder reply may take up to 120 µs before it can reply to a further interrogation.\n\nThe ground antenna has a typical horizontal 3 dB beamwidth of 2.5° which limits the accuracy in determining the bearing of the aircraft. Accuracy can be improved by making many interrogations as the antenna beam scans an aircraft and a better estimate can be obtained by noting where the replies started and where stopped and taking the centre of the replies as the direction of the aircraft. This is known as a sliding window process.\n\nThe early system used an antenna known as a \"hogtrough\". This has a large horizontal dimension to produce a narrow horizontal beam and a small vertical dimension to provide cover from close to the horizon to nearly overhead. There were two problems with this antenna. First, nearly half the energy is directed at the ground where it is reflected back up, and interferes with, the upward energy causing deep nulls at certain elevation angles and loss of contact with aircraft. Second, if the surrounding ground is sloping, then the reflected energy is partly offset horizontally, distorting the beam shape and the indicated bearing of the aircraft. This was particularly important in a monopulse system with its much improved bearing measurement accuracy.\n\nThe deficiencies in modes A and C were recognised quite early in the use of SSR and in 1967 Ullyatt published a paper and in 1969 an expanded paper, which proposed improvements to SSR to address the problems. The essence of the proposals was new interrogation and reply formats. Aircraft identity and altitude were to be included in the one reply so collation of the two data items would not be needed. To protect against errors a simple parity system was proposed – see \"Secondary Surveillance Radar – Today and Tomorrow\". Monopulse would be used to determine the bearing of the aircraft thereby reducing to one the number of interrogations/replies per aircraft on each scan of the antenna. Further each interrogation would be preceded by main beam pulses P1 and P2 separated by 2 µs so that transponders operating on modes A and C would take it as coming from the antenna sidelobe and not reply and not cause unnecessary FRUIT.\n\nThe FAA were also considering similar problems but were assuming that a new pair of frequencies would be required. Ullyatt showed that the existing 1030 MHz and 1090 MHz frequencies could be retained and the existing ground interrogators and airbornes transponders, with suitable modifications, could be used. The result was a Memorandum of Understanding between the US and the UK to develop a common system. In the US the programme was called DABS (Discrete Address Beacon System), and in the UK Adsel (Address selective).\n\nMonopulse, which means single pulse, had been used in military track-and-follow systems whereby the antenna was steered to follow a particular target by keeping the target in the centre of the beam. Ullyatt proposed the use of a continuously rotating beam with bearing measurement made wherever the pulse may arrive in the beam.\n\nThe FAA engaged Lincoln Laboratory of MIT to further design the system and it produced a series of ATC Reports defining all aspects of the new joint development. Notable additions to the concept proposed by Ullyatt was the use of a more powerful 24-bit parity system using a cyclic redundancy code, which not only ensured the accuracy of the received data without the need for repetition but also allowed errors caused by an overlapping FRUIT reply to be corrected. Further the proposed aircraft identity code also comprised 24 bits with 16 million permutations. This allowed each aircraft to be wired with its own unique address. Blocks of addresses are allocated to different countries and further allocated to particular airlines so that knowledge of the address could identify a particular aircraft. The Lincoln Laboratory report ATC 42 entitled \"Mode S Beacon System: Functional Description\" gave details on the proposed new system.\n\nThe two countries reported the results of their development in a joint paper, \"ADSEL/DABS – A Selective Address Secondary Surveillance Radar\".<ref name = \"ADSEL/DABS\">Bowes R.C., Drouilhet P.R., Weiss H.G. and Stevens M.C., \"ADSEL/DABS – A Selective Address Secondary Surveillance Radar\",AGARD Conference Proceedings No. 188. 20th Symposium of the Guidance and Control Panel held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, 20–23 May 1975</ref> This was followed at a conference at ICAO Headquarters in Montreal, at which a low-power interrogation constructed by Lincoln Laboratory successfully communicated with an upgraded commercial SSR transponder of UK manufacture.\nThe only thing needed was an international name. Much had been made of the proposed new features but the existing ground SSR interrogators would still be used, albeit with modification, and the existing airbound transponders, again with modification. The best way of showing that this was an evolution not a revolution was to still call it SSR but with a new mode letter. Mode S was the obvious choice, with the S standing for select. In 1983 ICAO issued an advisory circular, which described the new system.\n\nThe problem with the existing standard \"hogtrough\" antenna was caused by the energy radiated toward the ground, which was reflected up and interfered with the upwards directed energy. The answer was to shape the vertical beam. This necessitated a vertical array of dipoles suitably fed to produce the desired shape. A five-foot vertical dimension was found to be optimum and this has become the international standard.\n\nThe new Mode S system was intended to operate with just a single reply from an aircraft, a system known as monopulse. The accompanying diagram shows a conventional main or \"sum\" beam of an SSR antenna to which has been added a \"difference\" beam. To produce the sum beam the signal is distributed horizontally across the antenna aperture. This feed system is divided into two equal halves and the two parts summed again to produce the original sum beam. However the two halves are also subtracted to produce a difference output. A signal arriving exactly normal, or boresight, to the antenna will produce a maximum output in the sum beam but a zero signal in the difference beam. Away from boresight the signal in the sum beam will be less but there will be a non-zero signal in the difference beam. The angle of arrival of the signal can be determined by measuring the ratio of the signals between the sum and difference beams. The ambiguity about boresight can be resolved as there is a 180° phase change in the difference signal either side of boresight. Bearing measurements can be made on a single pulse, hence monopulse, but accuracy can be improved by averaging measurements made on several or all of the pulses received in a reply from an aircraft. A monopulse receiver was developed early in the UK Adsel programme and this design is still used widely today. Mode S reply pulses are deliberately designed to be similar to mode A and C replies so the same receiver can be used to provide improved bearing measurement for the SSR mode A and C system with the advantage that the interrogation rate can be substantially reduced thereby reducing the interference caused to other users of the system.\n\nLincoln Laboratory exploited the availability of a separate bearing measurement on each reply pulse to overcome some of the problems of garble whereby two replies overlap making associating the pulses with the two replies. Since each pulse is separately labelled with direction this information can be used to unscramble two overlapping mode A or C replies. The process is presented in ATC-65 \"The ATCRBS Mode of DABS\". The approach can be taken further by also measuring the strength of each reply pulse and using that as a discriminate as well. The following table compares the performance of conventional SSR, monopulse SSR (MSSR) and Mode S.\n\nThe MSSR replaced most of the existing SSRs by the 1990s and its accuracy provided for a reduction of separation minima in en-route ATC from to \n\nMSSR resolved many of the system problems of SSR, as changes to the ground system only, were required. The existing transponders installed in aircraft were unaffected. It undoubtedly resulted in the delay of Mode S.\n\nA more detailed description of Mode S is given in the Eurocontrol publication \"Principles of Mode S and Interrogator Codes\" and the ICAO circular 174-AN/110 \"Secondary Surveillance Radar Mode S Advisory Circular\". The 16 million permutations of the 24 bit aircraft address codes have been allocated in blocks to individual states and the assignment is given in ICAO Annex 10, Volume III, Chapter 9.\n\nA mode S interrogation comprises two 0.8 µs wide pulses, which are interpreted by a mode A & C transponder as coming from an antenna sidelobe and therefore a reply is not required. The following long P6 pulse is phase modulated with the first phase reversal, after 1.25 µs, synchronising the transponder's phase detector. Subsequent phase reversals indicate a data bit of 1, with no phase reversal indicating a bit of value 0. This form of modulation provides some resistance to corruption by a chance overlapping pulse from another ground interrogator. The interrogation may be short with P6 = 16.125 µs, mainly used to obtain a position update, or long, P6 = 30.25 µs, if an additional 56 data bits are included. The final 24 bits contain both the parity and address of the aircraft. On receiving an interrogation, an aircraft will decode the data and calculate the parity. If the remainder is not the address of the aircraft then either the interrogation was not intended for it or it was corrupted. In either case it will not reply. If the ground station was expecting a reply and did not receive one then it will re-interrogate.\n\nThe aircraft reply consists of a preamble of four pulses spaced so that they cannot be erroneously formed from overlapping mode A or C replies. The remaining pulses contain data using pulse position amplitude modulation. Each 1 µs interval is divided into two parts. If a 0.5 µs pulse occupies the first half and there is no pulse in the second half then a binary 1 is indicated. If it is the other way round then it represents a binary 0. In effect the data is transmitted twice, the second time in inverted form. This format is very resistant to error due to a garbling reply from another aircraft. To cause a hard error one pulse has to be cancelled and a second pulse inserted in the other half of the bit period. Much more likely is that both halves are confused and the decoded bit is flagged as \"low confidence\".\n\nThe reply also has parity and address in the final 24 bits. The ground station tracks the aircraft and uses the predicted position to indicate the range and bearing of the aircraft so it can interrogate again and get an update of its position. If it is expecting a reply and if it receives one then it checks the remainder from the parity check against the address of the expected aircraft. If it is not the same then either it is the wrong aircraft and a re-interrogation is necessary, or the reply has been corrupted by interference by being garbled by another reply. The parity system has the power to correct errors as long as they do not exceed 24 µs, which embraces the duration of a mode A or C reply, the most expected source of interference in the early days of Mode S. The pulses in the reply have individual monopulse angle measurements available, and in some implementations also signal strength measurements, which can indicate bits that are inconsistent with the majority of the other bits, thereby indicating possible corruption. A test is made by inverting the state of some or all of these bits (a 0 changed to a 1 or vice versa) and if the parity check now succeeds the changes are made permanent and the reply accepted. If it fails then a re-interrogation is required.\n\nMode S operates on the principle that interrogations are directed to a specific aircraft using that aircraft's unique address. This results in a single reply with aircraft range determined by the time taken to receive the reply and monopulse providing an accurate bearing measurement. In order to interrogate an aircraft its address must be known. To meet this requirement the ground interrogator also broadcasts All-Call interrogations, which are in two forms.\nIn one form, the Mode A/C/S All-Call looks like a conventional Mode A or C interrogation at first and a transponder will start the reply process on receipt of pulse P3. However a Mode S transponder will abort this procedure upon the detection of pulse P4, and instead respond with a short Mode S reply containing its 24 bit address. This form of All-Call interrogation is now not much used as it will continue to obtain replies from aircraft already known and give rise to unnecessary interference. The alternative form of All-Call uses short Mode S interrogation with a 16.125 µs data block. This can include an indication of the interrogator transmitting the All-Call with the request that if the aircraft has already replied to this interrogator then do not reply again as aircraft is already known and a reply unnecessary.\n\nThe Mode S interrogation can take three forms:\nThe first five bits, known as the uplink field (UF) in the data block indicate the type of interrogation. The final 24 bits in each case is combined aircraft address and parity. Not all permutations have yet been allocated but those that have are shown:\n\nSimilarly the Mode S reply can take three forms:\n\nThe first five bits, known as the downlink field (DF) in the data block indicate the type of reply. The final 24 bits in each case is combined aircraft address and parity. Eleven permutations have been allocated.\n\nA transponder equipped to transmit Comm-B replies is fitted with 256 data registers each of 56 bits. The contents of these registers are filled and maintained from on-board data sources. If the ground system requires this data then it requests it by a Surveillance or Comm-A interrogation.\n\nICAO Annex 10 Volume III, Chapter 5 lists the contents of all those currently allocated. A reduced number are required for current operational use. Other registers are intended for use with TCAS and ADS-B. The Comm-B Data Selector (BDS) numbers are in hexadecimal notation.\n\nStarting in 2009, the ICAO defined an \"extended squitter\" mode of operation; it supplements the requirements contained in ICAO Annex 10, Volumes III and IV. The first edition specified earlier versions of extended squitter messages:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was based on the Rover 25, but had an increased ride height and chunkier bumpers. The car was marketed by Rover as an 'urban on-roader'. Production ended in April 2005, due to the bankruptcy of MG Rover, but reappeared in March 2008 in China as the MG 3 SW, following the purchase of MG Rover's assets by Nanjing Automobile Group.\n\nThe Rover Streetwise was an attempt by Rover to appeal to younger drivers. Rover had modernised the existing models in 1999 with a facelift for the 25, 45 and the Rover designed 75 models but Rover was suffering falling sales and a tarnished brand after the sale of Rover to the consortium of Phoenix in March 2000 by BMW. \n\nAlthough new models were in the planning stages, the 25 and 45 models would be at least ten years old before the new models were launched. Phoenix owned the rights to the MG brand, and had marketed the ZR, ZS and ZT with some success, restyling the existing 25, 45 and 75 models. This included tweaked suspension, new wheels, altered dashboard inserts, different seats and bodykits.\n\nWith the MG brand proving popular, MG Rover Group turned their attention to the Rover brand. The cars badged as Rover had a rather staid image, and were commonly associated with elderly motorists. Thus, MG Rover attempted to appeal to a younger market. \n\nMG Rover decided to design a car for a niche market, and chose the ‘urban on roader’ look, similar to the Audi A6 Allroad, Škoda Octavia Scout, Volvo XC70 and the Volkswagen Polo Fun/CrossPolo. The Streetwise ceased production in April 2005, when Rover ceased trading and went into administration.\n\nThe tough looking Streetwise was designed as a two-wheel drive urban car with 4x4 looks. The Streetwise had a 10mm higher ride height than the basic 25, and although it shared many of the common characteristics of the 25, it was visually different with large impact absorbing grey or black plastic bumpers. \n\nUnlike the rest of the Rover and MG range, the Streetwise bumpers were not colour coded. The front indicators were redesigned to complement the circular headlamps, and most models came with chunky sixteen inch wheels as standard. To extend the load space, the Streetwise was fitted with multi purpose roof bars, which also served to distinguish the Streetwise from the ZR and the 25, in addition to the standard 60/40 split rear seats.\n\nThe Streetwise offered a choice of sporty interiors, available in four or five seats (optional). The standard four seats had two separate rear seats and a separating centre console, and body hugging front sports seats on all models, trimmed in half leather on SE and later GSi models. All models came with a driver's airbag, PAS, remote central locking with perimetric alarm and ABS. \n\nThe S added electric front windows, body coloured door mirrors, 16\" Alloy wheels with security wheel nuts, CD Tuner with rear speakers and steering wheel remote audio controls. Top spec SE models further added air conditioning, electric door mirrors, leather steering wheel and gearknob, part leather seats with rear headrests, vhoice of seat facing colourway, front fog lamps, and body coloured bumper inserts.\n\nOther subtle changes included a revised centre console and a restyled blue instrument dials. All Streetwises came with Trafficmaster Alert, an early warning device to warn the drivers of congested routes. The Streetwise also came with rear parking sensors, as an option or as standard on higher models.\n\nThe Streetwise engines were available as 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 stepspeed (Automatic), and a 2.0 TD. The 1.6 and the 1.8 were less common.\n\nIn February 2008, the Streetwise, rebadged as the MG3 SW, was relaunched in China by Nanjing Automobile Group.\n\n"}

{"id": "2056520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056520", "title": "Teseney", "text": "Teseney\n\nTeseney (, ), also spelled Tessenei or Tesseney, is a market town in western Eritrea. It lies south-east of Kassala in Sudan, on the Gash River. The city was much fought over in the Eritrean War of Independence during which much of it was destroyed. After the war, Tessenei has become a governmental administrative center with customs and agricultural offices and a military base.\n\nTeseney is located 45 kilometers from the Sudanese border and approximately 115 kilometers beyond Barentu administrative or central admnistration of Gash Barka region. It is considered a frontier town on western Eritrea and many calls a land port because of its location and movemebts of people and goods from Sudan to Eritrea and vice versa. The town is made up of people of various ethnic backgrounds and most used language is the Arabic language because of the border and most of the people get back home from Sudan(people who left Eritrea deu to the War with Ethiopia for Indipendence). On the outskirts of Teseney to the north are a couple of hills from which there are exceptional views of the lowlands and mountains in Sudan. Also, farmers have been reporting of lions roaring in south of Teseney. In summer 2006, a young male lion was sighted and photographed, but since then, there has been no sighting and farmers do still report lions roars being echoed in the night. Monkeys and spotted hyenas form also part of Tessenei fauna, while acacia and Hyphaene thebaica palm locally known as Dom trees dominate its flora.\n\nThe name Tessenei with the diminutive of Seney(seni means nice/good in Tigre Eritrean language) or Teseney, means “let it be nice to dwell”. It is also called Sabbot by its native local inhabitants. In 1929, it was called by the Italian colonizers the Village of Gasperini (named after the former colonial governor of Eritrea, a native of Treviso in Italy ).\n\nTessenei, is divided into several \"Hillas\" or districts / quarters, inhabited by different ethnic groups.\nThere is in fact the Hillat Takarin which accommodates the ethnic group Takrour (originally emigrated Hausa and other clans from Nigeria hundreds of years ago), the Hillat Sudan (refers to the Sudanese community in the town) Hillat Halabit (inhabited by Beni Amer pastoralists); Hillat Somal (inhabited by Somalis, in the trading centre), built around a hill of granite blocks, just over 100 meter high, which separates it from the Hillat Takarin. There is small river that flows into the Gash: The stream Tadalay. Behind the hill runs an irrigation canal that takes water from the Gash, called Tur-a, (Arabic word for canal) and carries the waters from the stream to the lands cultivated with cotton (Ali Ghidir AgroIndustry), next/around to the village Ali Ghidir. The water supply is solved, thanks to a reservoir fed by a very old group of pumps (from the early 1930s) that draw water from the sands of the Gash. It is a huge deep basin, built on top on the small hill of granite, surrounded by old baobab trees. At the side of this large basin-tank, there was the Italian Civil Hospital, built in the 1920s, which for many years, has served the whole area near Tesseney, as far as the villages of Haikota, Gallug, Ali-Ghider, Talatahasher, Sabderat (villages bordering the Sudan), Sittimò, Aad Elit (village populated by about 1,000 individuals who speak a language all their own.\n\nDuring the colonial period both Tessenei and the neighbouring village of Ali Ghider ( also written as Ali Gidir or Aligidir) were the center of a vast agricultural development project using the enormous quantity of waters of the Gash river. The project dates back to 1905 when its first feasibility studies was forwarded by an Italian engineer called Nicola Coles. Works started in 1924 and included: a small dam and a tiny lake to store water (inaugurated in 1928 ) and numerous other works and a net of water irrigation canals to irrigate an approximately 10,000 hectares of land. An Italian agricultural-industrial company SIA, \"Società Imprese Africane\" (Company on African Enterprises), won this major concession. Later a consortium of which \"Cotonificio Barattolo\", with its seat in Asmara became the main shareholder. The main crop was cotton, a variety of Sakellaridis, the same as cultivated in Egypt and the entire production was exported to Italy where it enjoys customs facilities. A plant for the treatment of cotton, a large mill for the processing of seeds, a power plant and a workshop complete the work, along with a modern factory for spinning and weaving cotton was built in Tessenei. During the Anglo-Egyptian condominium a narrow gauge line of railway was built connecting Tessnei with Kassala in Sudan via Malwaya conjunction. This line has almost vanished since the early 1960s.\n\nThe Village of Ali Ghider was chosen as a field camp for the project. A big workshop and store for agricultural machinery and farm equipment was built, with four leading Italian directors in charge of its administration and field engineering; all living there. A very strange system for using the land and supervising the plantation was running, by the so-called \"blatas\" (a \"blata\" is Eritrean/Ethiopian aristocratic title equivalent to counsellor ). These \"blatas\" were brought to the area with their family ties and kin from places as far as Keren in central Eritrea. Blata Yassin, Blata Geme Almaday, Blata Jabir, Blata Melakin and Haj Gladios were the prominent \"blatas\". Hedareb (mainly Bet-Juk, Beni Amr, Maria and Sebdarat) tribes and 1500 ex-fighters and their families farm cotton, sesame and sorghum in Ali Ghider.\n\nAmerican Peace Corps in the 1960s had contributed to the education field in Tessenei by sending volunteer teachers. There was also an American evangelical medical clinic in the Centre of the city.\n\nThe events of the war that led to the independence of Eritrea caused the destruction of these colonial developmental works. Tessenei still contains few Italian relics.\n\nDuring the Eritrean War of Independence (1961–1991), Tessenei was repeatedly bombed, and was subject to severe fighting because of its proximity to the borders of Sudan, from which the Eritrean insurgents receive weapons and supplies, but it was also the first to be liberated in 1988, having suffered extensive damage. Outside Teseney, just beyond Haykota, is a monument to Hamid Idris Awate, who fired the first shots in the Eritrean liberation struggle in September 1961.\n\nThe town is a busy marketplace with nomadic traders, merchants and returnees from the Sudan. The main square in front of the mosque features many different trades, with tailors, cafés, bars and other shops. There is a busy exchange market where the Saudi Riyal and the Sudanese pound are exchanged to Eritrean Nakfas, and the food in the souk area has a distinctly Sudanese flavor. Teseney is one of the reception points for returnees from the refugee camps in the Sudan who then proceed to other locations.\n\nDuring the rainy season (July to September) most areas around Teseney are impassable, but the recently constructed asphalt road from Barentu to Tesenei guarantees a comfortable trip by road to this border village. Daily buses leave to Kassala in Sudan, Barentu and Asmara, the Eritrean capital.\n\n\nhttp://www.eritrea.be/old/eritrea-tesseney.htm\n"}

Another form of deer contraception, called GonaCon, produces antibodies to sex drive hormones in the deer, causing them to lose interest in mating.\n\nSimilar forms of injectable contraceptive are being studied for use in elk and gray squirrels.\n\nOral contraceptives may also be developed for population control among a variety of animals, including deer, feral pigs, coyotes, cougars, dogs and cats. One product that has success in mice, rats, and dogs originally went by the name Mouseopause, but was approved for commercial use under the name ContraPest.\n\nPigeons have been a target for experimental contraceptives for decades.

Burrows has directed over 50 television pilots and co-created the long-running television series \"Cheers\".\n\nIn 2016, Burrows directed his 1,000th TV episode, on NBC's \"Crowded\".\n\nBurrows was born to a Jewish family in Los Angeles, California, the son of Ruth (Levinson) and Abe Burrows, a well-known composer, director and writer. James has one sister, Laurie Burrows Grad. When James was still a young child, his family moved to New York where James attended New York’s High School of Music & Art. Burrows is a graduate of Oberlin College and the graduate program of the Yale School of Drama.\n\nAfter Yale, Burrows returned to California where he became employed as a dialogue coach on \"O.K. Crackerby!\", a television series starring Burl Ives and created by Burrows' father, Abe. Burrows then took a job as an assistant stage manager on the play \"Holly Golightly\", an adaptation of the novella \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\". The production was unsuccessful, but the job served as Burrows' introduction to its star, Mary Tyler Moore. Early on Burrows also worked for the road company of \"Cactus Flower\" and the Broadway production of \"Forty Carats\".\n\nBurrows continued working in theater as a stage manager and transitioned into directing plays. Burrows directed traveling plays and a production at a Jacksonville, Florida dinner theater.\n\nWhile working in theater, Burrows wrote Moore and her then husband Grant Tinker seeking a job at their production company, MTM Enterprises. In 1974, Tinker hired Burrows as a director for MTM Enterprises where he directed episodes of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" and \"The Bob Newhart Show\". Tinker asked director Jay Sandrich, known for his work directing \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" and later \"The Cosby Show\" and \"The Golden Girls\", to serve as a mentor to Burrows.\n\nBurrows is best known for his comic timing, complex blocking for actors, and incorporating more sophisticated lighting in television studio shoots.

The Charles brothers were also former employees of MTM Enterprises and served as producers on the series \"Taxi\" where Burrows worked as in-house director for 76 episodes. Burrows and the Charles brothers wanted to create a show where they could have more control. \"Cheers\" premiered on NBC on September 30, 1982. Although \"Cheers\" initially struggled in the ratings, the series became a hit, running 275 episodes over eleven seasons. Burrows directed all but 35 of those 275 episodes.\n\nBurrows has directed for many series, including:\n\n\nBurrows directed every episode of \"Will & Grace\" during its initial eight-year run.

An episode of \"Scrubs\", \"My Life in Four Cameras\", had a character named Charles James in honor of \"Cheers\" creators Burrows and Glen and Les Charles. It was previously asserted in \"Sitcoms: the 101 Greatest TV Comedies of All Time\" (2007) that Burrows served as the silhouette of the customer who knocks on the door in the final scene of \"Cheers\", but Burrows himself refuted this claim on episode 9 of the \"NewsRadio\"-themed podcast Dispatches from Fort Awesome, revealing that the actual \"Man Who Knocks\" was agent Bob Broder.\n\nOver the course of his career, Burrows has been nominated for fifteen Directors Guild of America awards, and for an Emmy Award every year between 1980 and 2005, excluding 1997.

{"id": "2056572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056572", "title": "Marine life", "text": "Marine life\n\nMarine life, or sea life or ocean life, is the plants, animals and other organisms that live in the salt water of the sea or ocean, or the brackish water of coastal estuaries. At a fundamental level, marine life affects the nature of the planet. Marine organisms produce oxygen and sequester carbon. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land. The term \"marine\" comes from the Latin \"mare\", meaning sea or ocean.\n\nMost life forms evolved initially in marine habitats. By volume, oceans provide about 90 percent of the living space on the planet. The earliest vertebrates appeared in the form of fish, which live exclusively in water. Some of these evolved into amphibians which spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Other fish evolved into land mammals and subsequently returned to the ocean as seals, dolphins or whales. Plant forms such as kelp and algae grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. Plankton forms the general foundation of the ocean food chain, particularly the phytoplankton which are key primary producers.\n\nMarine invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters, including breathing tubes as in mollusc siphons. Fish have gills instead of lungs, although some species of fish, such as the lungfish, have both. Marine mammals, such as dolphins, whales, otters, and seals need to surface periodically to breathe air.\n\nThere are over 200,000 documented marine species with perhaps two million marine species yet to be documented. Marine species range in size from the microscopic, including phytoplankton which can be as small as 0.02 micrometres, to huge cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises), including the blue whale – the largest known animal reaching in length. Marine microorganisms, including protists, bacteria and viruses, constitute about 70% of the total marine biomass.\n\nThere is no life without water. It has been described as the \"universal solvent\" for its ability to dissolve many substances, and as the \"solvent of life\". Water is the only common substance to exist as a solid, liquid, and gas under conditions normal to life on Earth. The Nobel Prize winner Albert Szent-Györgyi referred to water as the \"mater und matrix\": the mother and womb of life.\n\nThe abundance of surface water on Earth is a unique feature in the Solar System. Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of The deepest underwater location is Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean, having a depth of .\n\nConventionally the planet is divided into five separate oceans, but these oceans all connect into a single world ocean. The mass of this world ocean is 1.35 metric tons, or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The world ocean covers an area of with a mean depth of , resulting in an estimated volume of . If all of Earth's crustal surface was at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be about .\n\nAbout 97.5% of the water on Earth is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water. Most fresh water – about 69% – is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers. The average salinity of Earth's oceans is about of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% salt). Most of the salt in the ocean comes from the weathering and erosion of rocks on land. Some salts are released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.\n\nThe oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms. Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir. Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.\n\nAltogether the ocean occupies 71 percent of the world surface, averaging nearly in depth. By volume, the ocean provides about 90 percent of the living space on the planet. The science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke has pointed out it would be more appropriate to refer to planet Earth as planet Ocean.\n\nHowever water is found elsewhere in the solar system. Europa, one of the moons orbiting Jupiter, is slightly smaller than the Earth's moon. There is a strong possibility a large saltwater ocean exists beneath its ice surface. It has been estimated the outer crust of solid ice is about 10–30 km (6–19 mi) thick and the liquid ocean underneath is about 100 km (60 mi) deep. This would make Europa's ocean over twice the volume of the Earth's ocean. There has been speculation Europa's ocean could support life, and could be capable of supporting multicellular microorganisms if hydrothermal vents are active on the ocean floor. Enceladus, a small icy moon of Saturn, also has what appears to be an underground ocean which actively vents warm water from the moon's surface.\n\nThe Earth is about 4.54 billion years old. The earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates from at least 3.5 billion years ago, during the Eoarchean Era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon. Microbial mat fossils have been found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia. Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland as well as \"remains of biotic life\" found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia. According to one of the researchers, \"If life arose relatively quickly on Earth … then it could be common in the universe.\" \n\nAll organisms on Earth are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool. \nHighly energetic chemistry is thought to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago, and half a billion years later the last common ancestor of all life existed. The current scientific consensus is that the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical reactions. The beginning of life may have included self-replicating molecules such as RNA and the assembly of simple cells. In 2016 scientists reported a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all life, including microorganisms, living on Earth.\n\nCurrent species are a stage in the process of evolution, with their diversity the product of a long series of speciation and extinction events. The common descent of organisms was first deduced from four simple facts about organisms: First, they have geographic distributions that cannot be explained by local adaptation. Second, the diversity of life is not a set of completely unique organisms, but organisms that share morphological similarities. Third, vestigial traits with no clear purpose resemble functional ancestral traits and finally, that organisms can be classified using these similarities into a hierarchy of nested groups—similar to a family tree. However, modern research has suggested that, due to horizontal gene transfer, this \"tree of life\" may be more complicated than a simple branching tree since some genes have spread independently between distantly related species.\n\nPast species have also left records of their evolutionary history. Fossils, along with the comparative anatomy of present-day organisms, constitute the morphological, or anatomical, record. By comparing the anatomies of both modern and extinct species, paleontologists can infer the lineages of those species. However, this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Further, as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry.\n\nMore recently, evidence for common descent has come from the study of biochemical similarities between organisms. For example, all living cells use the same basic set of nucleotides and amino acids. The development of molecular genetics has revealed the record of evolution left in organisms' genomes: dating when species diverged through the molecular clock produced by mutations. For example, these DNA sequence comparisons have revealed that humans and chimpanzees share 98% of their genomes and analysing the few areas where they differ helps shed light on when the common ancestor of these species existed.\n\nProkaryotes inhabited the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago. No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms over the next few billion years. The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 billion years ago. The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants.\n\nThe history of life was that of the unicellular eukaryotes, prokaryotes and archaea until about 610 million years ago when multicellular organisms began to appear in the oceans in the Ediacaran period. The evolution of multicellularity occurred in multiple independent events, in organisms as diverse as sponges, brown algae, cyanobacteria, slime moulds and myxobacteria. In 2016 scientists reported that, about 800 million years ago, a minor genetic change in a single molecule called GK-PID may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells.\n\nSoon after the emergence of these first multicellular organisms, a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over a span of about 10 million years, in an event called the Cambrian explosion. Here, the majority of types of modern animals appeared in the fossil record, as well as unique lineages that subsequently became extinct. Various triggers for the Cambrian explosion have been proposed, including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from photosynthesis.\n\nAbout 500 million years ago, plants and fungi started colonising the land. Evidence for the appearance of the first land plants occurs in the Ordovician, around , in the form of fossil spores. Land plants began to diversify in the Late Silurian, from around . The colonisation of the land by plants was soon followed by arthropods and other animals. Insects were particularly successful and even today make up the majority of animal species. Amphibians first appeared around 364 million years ago, followed by early amniotes and birds around 155 million years ago (both from \"reptile\"-like lineages), mammals around 129 million years ago, homininae around 10 million years ago and modern humans around 250,000 years ago. However, despite the evolution of these large animals, smaller organisms similar to the types that evolved early in this process continue to be highly successful and dominate the Earth, with the majority of both biomass and species being prokaryotes.\n\nEstimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described.\n\nMicroorganisms make up about 70% of the marine biomass. A microorganism, or microbe, is a microscopic organism too small to be recognised with the naked eye. It can be single-celled or multicellular. Microorganisms are diverse and include all bacteria and archaea, most protozoa such as algae, fungi and certain microscopic animals such as rotifers.\n\nMany macroscopic animals and plants have microscopic juvenile stages. Some microbiologists also classify viruses (and viroids) as microorganisms, but others consider these as nonliving.\n\nMicroorganisms are crucial to nutrient recycling in ecosystems as they act as decomposers. Some microorganisms are pathogenic, causing disease and even death in plants and animals. As inhabitants of the largest environment on Earth, microbial marine systems drive changes in every global system. Microbes are responsible for virtually all the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean, as well as the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, other nutrients and trace elements.\n\nMicroscopic life undersea is diverse and still poorly understood, such as for the role of viruses in marine ecosystems. Most marine viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals, but are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems. They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and are the most important mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth. Viral activity may also contribute to the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean.\n\nA stream of airborne microorganisms circles the planet above weather systems but below commercial air lanes. Some peripatetic microorganisms are swept up from terrestrial dust storms, but most originate from marine microorganisms in sea spray. In 2018, scientists reported that hundreds of millions of viruses and tens of millions of bacteria are deposited daily on every square meter around the planet.\n\nMicroscopic organisms live throughout the biosphere. The mass of prokaryote microorganisms — which includes bacteria and archaea, but not the nucleated eukaryote microorganisms — may be as much as 0.8 trillion tons of carbon (of the total biosphere mass, estimated at between 1 and 4 trillion tons). Single-celled barophilic marine microbes have been found at a depth of in the Mariana Trench, the deepest spot in the Earth's oceans. Microorganisms live inside rocks below the sea floor under of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States, as well as beneath the seabed off Japan. The greatest known temperature at which microbial life can exist is (\"Methanopyrus kandleri\"). In 2014, scientists confirmed the existence of microorganisms living below the ice of Antarctica. According to one researcher, \"You can find microbes everywhere — they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are.\"\n\nViruses are small infectious agents that do not have their own metabolism and can replicate only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. The linear size of the average virus is about one one-hundredth that of the average bacterium. Most viruses cannot be seen with an optical microscope so electron microscopes are used instead.\n\nViruses are found wherever there is life and have probably existed since living cells first evolved. The origin of viruses is unclear because they do not form fossils, so molecular techniques have been used to compare the DNA or RNA of viruses and are a useful means of investigating how they arise.\n\nViruses are now recognised as ancient and as having origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the three domains. But the origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear: some may have evolved from plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity.\n\nOpinions differ on whether viruses are a form of life or organic structures that interact with living organisms. They are considered by some to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce by creating multiple copies of themselves through self-assembly, and evolve through natural selection. However they lack key characteristics such as a cellular structure generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as replicators and as \"organisms at the edge of life\".\n\nBacteriophages, often just called \"phages\", are viruses that parasite bacteria and archaea. Marine phages parasite marine bacteria and archaea, such as cyanobacteria. They are a common and diverse group of viruses and are the most abundant biological entity in marine environments, because their hosts, bacteria, are typically the numerically dominant cellular life in the sea. Generally there are about 1 million to 10 million viruses in each mL of seawater, or about ten times more double-stranded DNA viruses than there are cellular organisms, although estimates of viral abundance in seawater can vary over a wide range. Tailed bacteriophages appear to dominate marine ecosystems in number and diversity of organisms. Bacteriophages belonging to the families Corticoviridae, Inoviridae and Microviridae are also known to infect diverse marine bacteria.\n\nMicroorganisms make up about 70% of the marine biomass. It is estimated viruses kill 20% of this biomass each day and that there are 15 times as many viruses in the oceans as there are bacteria and archaea. Viruses are the main agents responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms, which often kill other marine life.\nThe number of viruses in the oceans decreases further offshore and deeper into the water, where there are fewer host organisms.\n\nThere are also archaean viruses which replicate within archaea: these are double-stranded DNA viruses with unusual and sometimes unique shapes. These viruses have been studied in most detail in the thermophilic archaea, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales.\n\nViruses are an important natural means of transferring genes between different species, which increases genetic diversity and drives evolution. It is thought that viruses played a central role in the early evolution, before the diversification of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, at the time of the last universal common ancestor of life on Earth. Viruses are still one of the largest reservoirs of unexplored genetic diversity on Earth.\n\nBacteria constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals.\n\nOnce regarded as plants constituting the class \"Schizomycetes\", bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes. Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes, bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles. Although the term \"bacteria\" traditionally included all prokaryotes, the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor. These evolutionary domains are called \"Bacteria\" and \"Archaea\".\n\nThe ancestors of modern bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the first forms of life to appear on Earth, about 4 billion years ago. For about 3 billion years, most organisms were microscopic, and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life. Although bacterial fossils exist, such as stromatolites, their lack of distinctive morphology prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution, or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species. However, gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial phylogeny, and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage. \nBacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence, that of the archaea and eukaryotes. Here, eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into endosymbiotic associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells, which were themselves possibly related to the Archaea. This involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of alphaproteobacterial symbionts to form either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes, which are still found in all known Eukarya. Later on, some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed cyanobacterial-like organisms. This led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants. There are also some algae that originated from even later endosymbiotic events. Here, eukaryotes engulfed a eukaryotic algae that developed into a \"second-generation\" plastid. This is known as secondary endosymbiosis.\n\nThe largest known bacterium, the marine \"Thiomargarita namibiensis\", can be visible to the naked eye and sometimes attains .\n\nThe archaea (Greek for \"ancient\") constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes are prokaryotes, meaning they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells.\n\nArchaea were initially classified as bacteria, but this classification is outdated. Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Classification is difficult because the majority have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment.\n\nArchaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape, although a few archaea have very strange shapes, such as the flat and square-shaped cells of \"Haloquadratum walsbyi\". Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes, such as archaeols. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from organic compounds, such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant archaea (the Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea fix carbon; however, unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea does both. Archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, no known species forms spores.\n\nArchaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle.\n\nProtists are eukaryotes that cannot be classified as plants, fungi or animals. They are usually single-celled and microscopic. Life originated as single-celled prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) and later evolved into more complex eukaryotes. Eukaryotes are the more developed life forms known as plants, animals, fungi and protists. The term protist came into use historically as a term of convenience for eukaryotes that cannot be strictly classified as plants, animals or fungi. They are not a part of modern cladistics, because they are paraphyletic (lacking a common ancestor). Protists can be broadly divided into four groups depending on whether their nutrition is plant-like, animal-like, fungus-like, or a mixture of these.\n\nProtists are highly diverse organisms currently organised into 18 phyla, but are not easy to classify. Studies have shown high protist diversity exists in oceans, deep sea-vents and river sediments, suggesting a large number of eukaryotic microbial communities have yet to be discovered. There has been little research on mixotrophic protists, but recent studies in marine environments found mixotrophic protests contribute a significant part of the protist biomass.\n\nIn contrast to the cells of prokaryotes, the cells of eukaryotes are highly organised. Plants, animals and fungi are usually multi-celled and are typically macroscopic. Most protists are single-celled and microscopic. But there are exceptions. Some single-celled marine protists are macroscopic. Some marine slime molds have unique life cycles that involve switching between unicellular, colonial, and multicellular forms. Other marine protist are neither single-celled nor microscopic, such as seaweed.\n\nProtists have been described as a taxonomic grab bag where anything that doesn't fit into one of the main biological kingdoms can be placed. Some modern authors prefer to exclude multicellular organisms from the traditional definition of a protist, restricting protists to unicellular organisms. This more constrained definition excludes seaweeds and slime molds.\n\nAs juveniles, animals develop from microscopic stages, which can include spores, eggs and larvae. At least one microscopic animal group, the parasitic cnidarian Myxozoa, is unicellular in its adult form, and includes marine species. Other adult marine microanimals are multicellular. Microscopic adult arthropods are more commonly found inland in freshwater, but there are marine species as well. Microscopic adult marine crustaceans include some copepods, cladocera and tardigrades (water bears). Some marine nematodes and rotifers are also too small to be recognised with the naked eye, as are many loricifera, including the recently discovered anaerobic species that spend their lives in an anoxic environment. Copepods contribute more to the secondary productivity and carbon sink of the world oceans than any other group of organisms.\n\nOver 1500 species of fungi are known from marine environments. These are parasitic on marine algae or animals, or are saprobes feeding on dead organic matter from algae, corals, protozoan cysts, sea grasses, wood and other substrata. Spores of many species have special appendages which facilitate attachment to the substratum. Marine fungi can also be found in sea foam and around hydrothermal areas of the ocean. A diverse range of unusual secondary metabolites is produced by marine fungi.\n\nMycoplankton are saprotropic members of the plankton communities of marine and freshwater ecosystems. They are composed of filamentous free-living fungi and yeasts associated with planktonic particles or phytoplankton. Similar to bacterioplankton, these aquatic fungi play a significant role in heterotrophic mineralization and nutrient cycling. Mycoplankton can be up to 20 mm in diameter and over 50 mm in length.\n\nA typical milliliter of seawater contains about 10 to 10 fungal cells. This number is greater in coastal ecosystems and estuaries due to nutritional runoff from terrestrial communities. A higher diversity of mycoplankton is found around coasts and in surface waters down to 1000 metres, with a vertical profile that depends on how abundant phytoplankton is. This profile changes between seasons due to changes in nutrient availability. Marine fungi survive in a constant oxygen deficient environment, and therefore depend on oxygen diffusion by turbulence and oxygen generated by photosynthetic organisms.\n\nMarine fungi can be classified as:\n\nLichens are mutualistic associations between a fungus, usually an ascomycete, and an alga or a cyanobacterium. Several lichens are found in marine environments. Many more occur in the splash zone, where they occupy different vertical zones depending on how tolerant they are to submersion. Some lichens live a long time; one species has been dated at 8,600 years. However their lifespan is difficult to measure because what defines the same lichen is not precise. Lichens grow by vegetatively breaking off a piece, which may or may not be defined as the same lichen, and two lichens of different ages can merge, raising the issue of whether it is the same lichen.\n\nThe sea snail \"Littoraria irrorata\" damages plants of \"Spartina\" in the sea marshes where it lives, which enables spores of intertidal ascomycetous fungi to colonise the plant. The snail then eats the fungal growth in preference to the grass itself.\n\nAccording to fossil records, fungi date back to the late Proterozoic era 900-570 million years ago. Fossil marine lichens 600 million years old have been discovered in China. It has been hypothesized that mycoplankton evolved from terrestrial fungi, likely in the Paleozoic era (390 million years ago).\n\nThe earliest animals were marine invertebrates, that is, vertebrates came later. Animals are multicellular eukaryotes, and are distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls. Marine invertebrates are animals that inhabit a marine environment apart from the vertebrate members of the chordate phylum; invertebrates lack a vertebral column. Some have evolved a shell or a hard exoskeleton.\n\nThe earliest animal fossils may belong to the genus \"Dickinsonia\", 571 million to 541 million years ago. Individual \"Dickinsonia\" typically resemble a bilaterally symmetrical ribbed oval. They kept growing until they were covered with sediment or otherwise killed, and spent most of their lives with their bodies firmly anchored to the sediment. Their taxonomic affinities are presently unknown, but their mode of growth is consistent with a bilaterian affinity.\n\nApart from \"Dickinsonia\", the earliest widely accepted animal fossils are the rather modern-looking cnidarians (the group that includes coral, jellyfish, sea anemones and \"Hydra\"), possibly from around The Ediacara biota, which flourished for the last 40 million years before the start of the Cambrian, were the first animals more than a very few centimetres long. Like \"Dickinsonia\", many were flat with a \"quilted\" appearance, and seemed so strange that there was a proposal to classify them as a separate kingdom, Vendozoa. Others, however, have been interpreted as early molluscs (\"Kimberella\"), echinoderms (\"Arkarua\"), and arthropods (\"Spriggina\", \"Parvancorina\"). There is still debate about the classification of these specimens, mainly because the diagnostic features which allow taxonomists to classify more recent organisms, such as similarities to living organisms, are generally absent in the Ediacarans. However, there seems little doubt that \"Kimberella\" was at least a triploblastic bilaterian animal, in other words, an animal significantly more complex than the cnidarians.\n\nSmall shelly fauna are a very mixed collection of fossils found between the Late Ediacaran and Middle Cambrian periods. The earliest, \"Cloudina\", shows signs of successful defense against predation and may indicate the start of an evolutionary arms race. Some tiny Early Cambrian shells almost certainly belonged to molluscs, while the owners of some \"armor plates,\" \"Halkieria\" and \"Microdictyon\", were eventually identified when more complete specimens were found in Cambrian lagerstätten that preserved soft-bodied animals.\n\nInvertebrates are grouped into different phyla. Informally phyla can be thought of as a way of grouping organisms according to their body plan. A body plan refers to a blueprint which describes the shape or morphology of an organism, such as its symmetry, segmentation and the disposition of its appendages. The idea of body plans originated with vertebrates, which were grouped into one phylum. But the vertebrate body plan is only one of many, and invertebrates consist of many phyla or body plans. The history of the discovery of body plans can be seen as a movement from a worldview centred on vertebrates, to seeing the vertebrates as one body plan among many. Among the pioneering zoologists, Linnaeus identified two body plans outside the vertebrates; Cuvier identified three; and Haeckel had four, as well as the Protista with eight more, for a total of twelve. For comparison, the number of phyla recognised by modern zoologists has risen to 35.\n\nHistorically body plans were thought of as having evolved rapidly during the Cambrian explosion, but a more nuanced understanding of animal evolution suggests a gradual development of body plans throughout the early Palaeozoic and beyond. More generally a phylum can be defined in two ways: as described above, as a group of organisms with a certain degree of morphological or developmental similarity (the phenetic definition), or a group of organisms with a certain degree of evolutionary relatedness (the phylogenetic definition).\n\nIn the 1970s there was already a debate about whether the emergence of the modern phyla was \"explosive\" or gradual but hidden by the shortage of Precambrian animal fossils. A re-analysis of fossils from the Burgess Shale lagerstätte increased interest in the issue when it revealed animals, such as \"Opabinia\", which did not fit into any known phylum. At the time these were interpreted as evidence that the modern phyla had evolved very rapidly in the Cambrian explosion and that the Burgess Shale's \"weird wonders\" showed that the Early Cambrian was a uniquely experimental period of animal evolution. Later discoveries of similar animals and the development of new theoretical approaches led to the conclusion that many of the \"weird wonders\" were evolutionary \"aunts\" or \"cousins\" of modern groups—for example that \"Opabinia\" was a member of the lobopods, a group which includes the ancestors of the arthropods, and that it may have been closely related to the modern tardigrades. Nevertheless, there is still much debate about whether the Cambrian explosion was really explosive and, if so, how and why it happened and why it appears unique in the history of animals.\n\nThe most basal animal phyla, the animals that evolved first, are the Porifera, Ctenophora, Placozoa and Cnidaria. None of these basal body plans exhibit bilateral symmetry.\n\nSponges are animals of the phylum Porifera (from Modern Latin for \"bearing pores\"). They are multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like mesohyl sandwiched between two thin layers of cells. They have unspecialized cells that can transform into other types and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges do not have nervous, digestive or circulatory systems. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes.\n\nSponges are similar to other animals in that they are multicellular, heterotrophic, lack cell walls and produce sperm cells. Unlike other animals, they lack true tissues and organs, and have no body symmetry. The shapes of their bodies are adapted for maximal efficiency of water flow through the central cavity, where it deposits nutrients, and leaves through a hole called the osculum. Many sponges have internal skeletons of spongin and/or spicules of calcium carbonate or silicon dioxide. All sponges are sessile aquatic animals. Although there are freshwater species, the great majority are marine (salt water) species, ranging from tidal zones to depths exceeding . Some sponges live to great ages; there is evidence of the deep-sea glass sponge \"Monorhaphis chuni\" living about 11,000 years.\n\nWhile most of the approximately 5,000–10,000 known species feed on bacteria and other food particles in the water, some host photosynthesizing micro-organisms as endosymbionts and these alliances often produce more food and oxygen than they consume. A few species of sponge that live in food-poor environments have become carnivores that prey mainly on small crustaceans.\n\nLinnaeus mistakenly identified sponges as plants in the order Algae. For a long time thereafter sponges were assigned to a separate subkingdom, Parazoa (meaning \"beside the animals\"). They are now classified as a paraphyletic phylum from which the higher animals have evolved.\n\nCtenophores (from Greek for \"carrying a comb\"), commonly known as comb jellies, are a phylum that live worldwide in marine waters. They are the largest non-colonial animals to swim with the help of cilia (hairs or combs). Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment, but some oceanic species are so fragile and transparent that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study. In the past ctenophores were thought to have only a modest presence in the ocean, but it is now known they are often significant and even dominant parts of the planktonic biomass.\n\nThe phylum has about 150 known species with a wide range of body forms. Sizes range from a few millimeters to . Cydippids are egg-shaped with their cilia arranged in eight radial comb rows, and deploy retractable tentacles for capturing prey. The benthic platyctenids are generally combless and flat. The coastal beroids have gaping mouths and lack tentacles. Most adult ctenophores prey on microscopic larvae and rotifers and small crustaceans but beroids prey on other ctenophores.\n\nEarly writers combined ctenophores with cnidarians. Ctenophores resemble cnidarians in relying on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration, as well as in having a decentralized nerve net rather than a brain. Also like cnidarians, the bodies of ctenophores consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells on the outside and another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, however, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only a single cell deep. While cnidarians exhibit radial symmetry, ctenophores have two anal canals which exhibit biradial symmetry (half-turn rotational symmetry). The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores.\n\nPlacozoa (from Greek for \"flat animals\") have the simplest structure of all animals. They are a basal form of free-living (non-parasitic) multicellular organism that do not yet have a common name. They form a phylum containing sofar only three described species, of which the first, the classical \"Trichoplax adhaerens\", was discovered in 1883. Two more species have been discovered since 2017, and genetic methods indicate this phylum has a further 100 to 200 undescribed species.\n\n\"Trichoplax\" is a small, flattened, animal about one mm across and usually about 25 µm thick. Like the amoebae they superficially resemble, they continually change their external shape. In addition, spherical phases occasionally form which may facilitate movement. \"Trichoplax\" lacks tissues and organs. There is no manifest body symmetry, so it is not possible to distinguish anterior from posterior or left from right. It is made up of a few thousand cells of six types in three distinct layers. The outer layer of simple epithelial cells bear cilia which the animal uses to help it creep along the seafloor. \"Trichoplax\" feed by engulfing and absorbing food particles – mainly microbes and organic detritus – with their underside.\n\nCnidarians (from Greek for \"nettle\") are distinguished by the presence of stinging cells, specialized cells that they use mainly for capturing prey. Cnidarians include corals, sea anemones, jellyfish and hydrozoans. They form a phylum containing over 10,000 species of animals found exclusively in aquatic (mainly marine) environments. Their bodies consist of mesoglea, a non-living jelly-like substance, sandwiched between two layers of epithelium that are mostly one cell thick. They have two basic body forms: swimming medusae and sessile polyps, both of which are radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes. Both forms have a single orifice and body cavity that are used for digestion and respiration.\n\nFossil cnidarians have been found in rocks formed about . Fossils of cnidarians that do not build mineralized structures are rare. Scientists currently think cnidarians, ctenophores and bilaterians are more closely related to calcareous sponges than these are to other sponges, and that anthozoans are the evolutionary \"aunts\" or \"sisters\" of other cnidarians, and the most closely related to bilaterians.\n\nCnidarians are the simplest animals in which the cells are organised into tissues. The starlet sea anemone is used as a model organism in research. It is easy to care for in the laboratory and a protocol has been developed which can yield large numbers of embryos on a daily basis. There is a remarkable degree of similarity in the gene sequence conservation and complexity between the sea anemone and vertebrates. In particular, genes concerned in the formation of the head in vertebrates are also present in the anemone.\n\nSome of the earliest bilaterians were wormlike, and the original bilaterian may have been a bottom dwelling worm with a single body opening. A bilaterian body can be conceptualized as a cylinder with a gut running between two openings, the mouth and the anus. Around the gut it has an internal body cavity, a coelom or pseudocoelom. Animals with this bilaterally symmetric body plan have a head (anterior) end and a tail (posterior) end as well as a back (dorsal) and a belly (ventral); therefore they also have a left side and a right side.\n\nHaving a front end means that this part of the body encounters stimuli, such as food, favouring cephalisation, the development of a head with sense organs and a mouth. The body stretches back from the head, and many bilaterians have a combination of circular muscles that constrict the body, making it longer, and an opposing set of longitudinal muscles, that shorten the body; these enable soft-bodied animals with a hydrostatic skeleton to move by peristalsis. They also have a gut that extends through the basically cylindrical body from mouth to anus. Many bilaterian phyla have primary larvae which swim with cilia and have an apical organ containing sensory cells. However, there are exceptions to each of these characteristics; for example, adult echinoderms are radially symmetric (unlike their larvae), and certain parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures.\n\nProtostomes (from Greek for \"first mouth\") are a superphylum of animals. It is a sister clade of the deuterostomes (from Greek for \"second mouth\"), with which it forms the Nephrozoa clade. Protostomes are distinguished from deuterostomes by the way their embryos develop. In protostomes the first opening that develops becomes the mouth, while in deuterostomes it becomes the anus.\n\nWorms (Old English for \"serpents\") form a number of phyla. Different groups of marine worms are related only distantly, so they are found in several different phyla such as the Annelida (segmented worms), Chaetognatha (arrow worms), Phoronida (horseshoe worms), and Hemichordata. All worms, apart from the Hemichordata, are protostomes. The Hemichordata are \ndeuterostomes and are discussed in their own section below.\n\nThe typical body plan of a worm involves long cylindrical tube-like bodies and no limbs. Marine worms vary in size from microscopic to over in length for some marine polychaete worms (bristle worms) and up to for the marine nemertean worm (bootlace worm). Some marine worms occupy a small variety of parasitic niches, living inside the bodies of other animals, while others live more freely in the marine environment or by burrowing underground. Many of these worms have specialized tentacles used for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide and also may be used for reproduction. Some marine worms are tube worms, such as the giant tube worm which lives in waters near underwater volcanoes and can withstand temperatures up to 90 degrees Celsius. Platyhelminthes (flatworms) form another worm phylum which includes a class of parasitic tapeworms. The marine tapeworm \"Polygonoporus giganticus\", found in the gut of sperm whales, can grow to over 30 m (100 ft).\n\nNematodes (roundworms) constitute a further worm phylum with tubular digestive systems and an opening at both ends. Over 25,000 nematode species have been described, of which more than half are parasitic. It has been estimated another million remain undescribed. They are ubiquitous in marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments, where they often outnumber other animals in both individual and species counts. They are found in every part of the earth's lithosphere, from the top of mountains to the bottom of oceanic trenches. By count they represent 90% of all animals on the ocean floor. Their numerical dominance, often exceeding a million individuals per square meter and accounting for about 80% of all individual animals on earth, their diversity of life cycles, and their presence at various trophic levels point at an important role in many ecosystems.\n\nMolluscs (Latin for \"soft\") form a phylum with about 85,000 extant recognized species. They are the largest marine phylum in terms of species count, containing about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Molluscs have more varied forms than other invertebrate phyla. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat.\n\nThe mollusc phylum is divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes. These classes include gastropods, bivalves and cephalopods, as well as other lesser-known but distinctive classes. Gastropods with protective shells are referred to as snails, whereas gastropods without protective shells are referred to as slugs. Gastropods are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of species. Bivalves include clams, oysters, cockles, mussels, scallops, and numerous other families. There are about 8,000 marine bivalves species (including brackish water and estuarine species). A deep sea ocean quahog clam has been reported as having lived 507 years making it the longest recorded life of all animals apart from colonial animals, or near-colonial animals like sponges.\n\nCephalopods include octopus, squid and cuttlefish. About 800 living species of marine cephalopods have been identified, and an estimated 11,000 extinct taxa have been described. They are found in all oceans, but there are no fully freshwater cephalopods.\n\nMolluscs have such diverse shapes that many textbooks base their descriptions of molluscan anatomy on a generalized or \"hypothetical ancestral mollusc\". This generalized mollusc is unsegmented and bilaterally symmetrical with an underside consisting of a single muscular foot. Beyond that it has three further key features. Firstly, it has a muscular cloak called a mantle covering its viscera and containing a significant cavity used for breathing and excretion. A shell secreted by the mantle covers the upper surface. Secondly (apart from bivalves) it has a rasping tongue called a radula used for feeding. Thirdly, it has a nervous system including a complex digestive system using microscopic, muscle-powered hairs called cilia to exude mucus. The generalized mollusc has two paired nerve cords (three in bivalves). The brain, in species that have one, encircles the esophagus. Most molluscs have eyes and all have sensors detecting chemicals, vibrations, and touch.\n\nGood evidence exists for the appearance of marine gastropods, cephalopods and bivalves in the Cambrian period .\n\nArthropods (Greek for \"jointed feet\") have an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). They form a phylum which includes insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments.\n\nThe evolutionary ancestry of arthropods dates back to the Cambrian period and is generally regarded as monophyletic. However, basal relationships of arthropods with extinct phyla such as lobopodians have recently been debated.\n\nExtant marine arthropods range in size from the microscopic crustacean \"Stygotantulus\" to the Japanese spider crab. Arthropods' primary internal cavity is a hemocoel, which accommodates their internal organs, and through which their haemolymph - analogue of blood - circulates; they have open circulatory systems. Like their exteriors, the internal organs of arthropods are generally built of repeated segments. Their nervous system is \"ladder-like\", with paired ventral nerve cords running through all segments and forming paired ganglia in each segment. Their heads are formed by fusion of varying numbers of segments, and their brains are formed by fusion of the ganglia of these segments and encircle the esophagus. The respiratory and excretory systems of arthropods vary, depending as much on their environment as on the subphylum to which they belong.\n\nArthropod vision relies on various combinations of compound eyes and pigment-pit ocelli: in most species the ocelli can only detect the direction from which light is coming, and the compound eyes are the main source of information. Arthropods also have a wide range of chemical and mechanical sensors, mostly based on modifications of the many setae (bristles) that project through their cuticles. Arthropod methods of reproduction are diverse: terrestrial species use some form of internal fertilization while marine species lay eggs using either internal or external fertilization. Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults to grubs that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total metamorphosis to produce the adult form.\n\nIn deuterostomes the first opening that develops in the growing embryo becomes the anus, while in protostomes it becomes the mouth. Deuterostomes form a superphylum of animals and are the sister clade of the protostomes. The earliest known deuterostomes are \"Saccorhytus\" fossils from about 540 million years ago. The \"Saccorhytus\" mouth may have functioned also as its anus.\n\nEchinoderms (Greek for \"spiny skin\") is a phylum which contains only marine invertebrates. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes, after the chordates.\n\nAdult echinoderms are recognizable by their radial symmetry (usually five-point) and include starfish, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies. Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. They are unique among animals in having bilateral symmetry at the larval stage, but fivefold symmetry (pentamerism, a special type of radial symmetry) as adults.\n\nEchinoderms are important both biologically and geologically. Biologically, there are few other groupings so abundant in the biotic desert of the deep sea, as well as shallower oceans. Most echinoderms are able to regenerate tissue, organs, limbs, and reproduce asexually; in some cases, they can undergo complete regeneration from a single limb. Geologically, the value of echinoderms is in their ossified skeletons, which are major contributors to many limestone formations, and can provide valuable clues as to the geological environment. They were the most used species in regenerative research in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nIt is held by some scientists that the radiation of echinoderms was responsible for the Mesozoic Marine Revolution. Aside from the hard-to-classify \"Arkarua\" (a Precambrian animal with echinoderm-like pentamerous radial symmetry), the first definitive members of the phylum appeared near the start of the Cambrian.\n\nHemichordates form a sister phylum to the echinoderms. They are solitary worm-shaped organisms rarely seen by humans because of their lifestyle. They include two main groups, the acorn worms and the Pterobranchia. Pterobranchia form a class containing about 30 species of small worm-shaped animals that live in secreted tubes on the ocean floor. Acorn worms form a class containing about 111 species that generally live in U-shaped burrows on the seabed, from the shoreline to a depth of 3000 metres. The worms lie there with the proboscis sticking out of one opening in the burrow, subsisting as deposit feeders or suspension feeders. It is supposed the ancestors of acorn worms used to live in tubes like their relatives, the Pterobranchia, but eventually started to live a safer and more sheltered existence in sediment burrows. Some of these worms may grow to be very long; one particular species may reach a length of 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in), although most acorn worms are much smaller.\n\nAcorn worms are more highly specialised and advanced than other worm-like organisms. They have a circulatory system with a heart that also functions as a kidney. Acorn worms have gill-like structures they use for breathing, similar to the gills of fish. Therefore, acorn worms are sometimes said to be a link between classical invertebrates and vertebrates. Acorn worms continually form new gill slits as they grow in size, and some older individuals have more than a hundred on each side. Each slit consists of a branchial chamber opening to the pharynx through a U-shaped cleft. Cilia push water through the slits, maintaining a constant flow, just as in fish. Some acorn worms also have a postanal tail which may be homologous to the post-anal tail of vertebrates.\n\nThe three-section body plan of the acorn worm is no longer present in the vertebrates, except in the anatomy of the frontal neural tube, later developed into a brain divided into three parts. This means some of the original anatomy of the early chordate ancestors is still present in vertebrates even if it is not always visible. One theory is the three-part body originated from an early common ancestor of the deuterostomes, and maybe even from a common bilateral ancestor of both deuterostomes and protostomes. Studies have shown the gene expression in the embryo share three of the same signaling centers that shape the brains of all vertebrates, but instead of taking part in the formation of their neural system, they are controlling the development of the different body regions.\n\nThe chordate phylum has three subphyla, one of which is the vertebrates (see below). The other two subphyla are marine invertebrates: the tunicates (salps and sea squirts) and the cephalochordates (such as lancelets). Invertebrate chordates are close relatives to vertebrates. In particular, there has been discussion about how closely some extinct marine species, such as Pikaiidae, Palaeospondylus, Zhongxiniscus and Vetulicolia, might relate ancestrally to vertebrates.\n\nVertebrates (Latin for \"joints of the spine\") are a subphylum of chordates. They are chordates that have a vertebral column (backbone). The vertebral column provides the central support structure for an internal skeleton which gives shape, support, and protection to the body and can provide a means of anchoring fins or limbs to the body. The vertebral column also serves to house and protect the spinal cord that lies within the vertebral column.\n\nMarine vertebrates can be divided into marine fish and marine tetrapods.\n\nFish typically breathe by extracting oxygen from water through gills and have a skin protected by scales and mucous. They use fins to propel and stabilise themselves in the water, and usually have a two-chambered heart and eyes well adapted to seeing underwater, as well as other sensory systems. Over 33,000 species of fish have been described as of 2017, of which about 20,000 are marine fish.\nEarly fish had no jaws. Most went extinct when they were outcompeted by jawed fish (below), but two groups survived: hagfish and lampreys. Hagfish form a class of about 20 species of eel-shaped, slime-producing marine fish. They are the only known living animals that have a skull but no vertebral column. Lampreys form a superclass containing 38 known extant species of jawless fish. The adult lamprey is characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth. Although they are well known for boring into the flesh of other fish to suck their blood, only 18 species of lampreys are actually parasitic. Together hagfish and lampreys are the sister group to vertebrates. Living hagfish remain similar to hagfish from around 300 million years ago. The lampreys are a very ancient lineage of vertebrates, though their exact relationship to hagfishes and jawed vertebrates is still a matter of dispute. Molecular analysis since 1992 has suggested that hagfish are most closely related to lampreys, and so also are vertebrates in a monophyletic sense. Others consider them a sister group of vertebrates in the common taxon of craniata.\n\nThe Tully monster is an extinct genus of soft-bodied bilaterians that lived in tropical estuaries about 300 million years ago. Since 2016 there has been controversy over whether this animal was a vertebrate or an invertebrate. In 2020 researchers found \"strong evidence\" that the Tully monster was a vertebrate, and was a jawless fish in the lineage of the lamprey.\n\nPteraspidomorphi is an extinct class of early jawless fish ancestral to jawed vertebrates. The few characteristics they share with the latter are now considered as primitive for all vertebrates.\n\nAround the start of the Devonian, fish started appearing with a deep remodelling of the vertebrate skull that resulted in a jaw.\nAll vertebrate jaws, including the human jaw, have evolved from these early fish jaws. The appearance of the early vertebrate jaw has been described as \"perhaps the most profound and radical evolutionary step in vertebrate history\". Jaws make it possible to capture, hold, and chew prey. Fish without jaws had more difficulty surviving than fish with jaws, and most jawless fish became extinct during the Triassic period.\n\nJawed fish fall into two main groups: fish with bony internal skeletons and fish with cartilaginous internal skeletons. Cartilaginous fish, such as sharks and rays, have jaws and skeletons made of cartilage rather than bone. Megalodon is an extinct species of shark that lived about 28 to 1.5 Ma. It looked much like a stocky version of the great white shark, but was much larger with fossil lengths reaching . Found in all oceans it was one of the largest and most powerful predators in vertebrate history, and probably had a profound impact on marine life. The Greenland shark has the longest known lifespan of all vertebrates, about 400 years. Some sharks such as the great white are partially warm blooded and give live birth. The manta ray, largest ray in the world, has been targeted by fisheries and is now vulnerable.\n\nBony fish have jaws and skeletons made of bone rather than cartilage. Bony fish also have hard, bony plates called operculum which help them respire and protect their gills, and they often possess a swim bladder which they use for better control of their buoyancy. Bony fish can be further divided into those with lobe fins and those with ray fins. The approximate dates in the phylogenetic tree are from Near et al., 2012 and Zhu et al., 2009.\n\nLobe fins have the form of fleshy lobes supported by bony stalks which extend from the body. \"Guiyu oneiros\", the earliest-known bony fish, lived during the Late Silurian 419 million years ago. It has the combination of both ray-finned and lobe-finned features, although analysis of the totality of its features place it closer to lobe-finned fish. Lobe fins evolved into the legs of the first tetrapod land vertebrates, so by extension an early ancestor of humans was a lobe-finned fish. Apart from the coelacanths and the lungfishes, lobe-finned fishes are now extinct.\n\nThe remaining bony fish have ray fins. These are made of webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines (rays) which can be erected to control the fin stiffness.\n\n\nAbout 96% of the world's fish species are teleosts, of which about 14,000 are marine species. Teleosts can be distinguished from other bony fish by their possession of a homocercal tail, a tail where the upper half mirrors the lower half. Another difference lies in their jaw bones – teleosts have modifications in the jaw musculature which make it possible for them to protrude their jaws. This enables them to grab prey and draw it into their mouth. In general, teleosts tend to be quicker and more flexible than more basal bony fishes. Their skeletal structure has evolved towards greater lightness. While teleost bones are well calcified, they are constructed from a scaffolding of struts, rather than the dense cancellous bones of holostean fish.\n\nTeleosts are found in almost all marine habitats. They have enormous diversity, and range in size from adult gobies 8mm long to ocean sunfish weighting over 2,000 kg. The following images show something of the diversity in the shape and colour of modern marine teleosts...\n\nA tetrapod (Greek for \"four feet\") is a vertebrate with limbs (feet). Tetrapods evolved from ancient lobe-finned fishes about 400 million years ago during the Devonian Period when their earliest ancestors emerged from the sea and adapted to living on land. This change from a body plan for breathing and navigating in gravity-neutral water to a body plan with mechanisms enabling the animal to breath in air without dehydrating and move on land is one of the most profound evolutionary changes known. Tetrapods can be divided into four classes: amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.\nMarine tetrapods are tetrapods that returned from land back to the sea again. The first returns to the ocean may have occurred as early as the Carboniferous Period whereas other returns occurred as recently as the Cenozoic, as in cetaceans, pinnipeds, and several modern amphibians. Amphibians (from Greek for \"both kinds of life\") live part of their life in water and part on land. They mostly require fresh water to reproduce. A few inhabit brackish water, but there are no true marine amphibians. There have been reports, however, of amphibians invading marine waters, such as a Black Sea invasion by the natural hybrid \"Pelophylax esculentus\" reported in 2010.\n\nReptiles (Late Latin for \"creeping\" or \"crawling\") do not have an aquatic larval stage, and in this way are unlike amphibians. Most reptiles are oviparous, although several species of squamates are viviparous, as were some extinct aquatic clades — the fetus develops within the mother, contained in a placenta rather than an eggshell. As amniotes, reptile eggs are surrounded by membranes for protection and transport, which adapt them to reproduction on dry land. Many of the viviparous species feed their fetuses through various forms of placenta analogous to those of mammals, with some providing initial care for their hatchlings.\n\nSome reptiles are more closely related to birds than other reptiles, and many scientists prefer to make Reptilia a monophyletic group which includes the birds. Extant non-avian reptiles which inhabit or frequent the sea include sea turtles, sea snakes, terrapins, the marine iguana, and the saltwater crocodile. Currently, of the approximately 12,000 extant reptile species and sub-species, only about 100 of are classed as marine reptiles.\n\nExcept for some sea snakes, most extant marine reptiles are oviparous and need to return to land to lay their eggs. Apart from sea turtles, the species usually spend most of their lives on or near land rather than in the ocean. Sea snakes generally prefer shallow waters nearby land, around islands, especially waters that are somewhat sheltered, as well as near estuaries. Unlike land snakes, sea snakes have evolved flattened tails which help them swim.\n\nSome extinct marine reptiles, such as ichthyosaurs, evolved to be viviparous and had no requirement to return to land. Ichthyosaurs resembled dolphins. They first appeared about 245 million years ago and disappeared about 90 million years ago. The terrestrial ancestor of the ichthyosaur had no features already on its back or tail that might have helped along the evolutionary process. Yet the ichthyosaur developed a dorsal and tail fin which improved its ability to swim. The biologist Stephen Jay Gould said the ichthyosaur was his favourite example of convergent evolution. The earliest marine reptiles arose in the Permian. During the Mesozoic many groups of reptiles became adapted to life in the seas, including ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, mosasaurs, nothosaurs, placodonts, sea turtles, thalattosaurs and thalattosuchians. Marine reptiles were less numerous after mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous.\n\nMarine birds are adapted to life within the marine environment. They are often called \"seabirds\". While marine birds vary greatly in lifestyle, behaviour and physiology, they often exhibit striking convergent evolution, as the same environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations. Examples include albatross, penguins, gannets, and auks.\n\nIn general, marine birds live longer, breed later and have fewer young than terrestrial birds do, but they invest a great deal of time in their young. Most species nest in colonies, which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for undertaking long annual migrations, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Marine birds can be highly pelagic, coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely. Some marine birds plummet from heights, plunging through the water leaving vapour-like trails, similar to that of fighter planes. Gannets plunge into the water at up to 100 kilometres per hour (60 mph). They have air sacs under their skin in their face and chest which act like bubble-wrap, cushioning the impact with the water.\n\nThe first marine birds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern marine bird families emerged in the Paleogene.\n\nMammals (from Latin for \"breast\") are characterised by the presence of mammary glands which in females produce milk for feeding (nursing) their young. There are about 130 living and recently extinct marine mammal species such as seals, dolphins, whales, manatees, sea otters and polar bears. They do not represent a distinct taxon or systematic grouping, but are instead unified by their reliance on the marine environment for feeding. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic; they spend the majority of their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living. Their diet varies considerably as well: some may eat zooplankton; others may eat fish, squid, shellfish, and sea-grass; and a few may eat other mammals.\n\nIn a process of convergent evolution, marine mammals, especially cetaceans such as dolphins and whales, redeveloped their body plan to parallel the streamlined fusiform body plan of pelagic fish. Front legs became flippers and back legs disappeared, a dorsal fin reappeared and the tail morphed into a powerful horizontal fluke. This body plan is an adaptation to being an active predator in a high drag environment. A parallel convergence occurred with the now extinct marine reptile ichthyosaur.\n\nPrimary producers are the autotroph organisms that make their own food instead of eating other organisms. This means primary producers become the starting point in the food chain for heterotroph organisms that do eat other organisms. Some marine primary producers are specialised bacteria and archaea which are chemotrophs, making their own food by gathering around hydrothermal vents and cold seeps and using chemosynthesis. However most marine primary production comes from organisms which use photosynthesis on the carbon dioxide dissolved in the water. This process uses energy from sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars that can be used both as a source of chemical energy and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells. Marine primary producers are important because they underpin almost all marine animal life by generating most of the oxygen and food that provide other organisms with the chemical energy they need to exist.\n\nThe principal marine primary producers are cyanobacteria, algae and marine plants. The oxygen released as a by-product of photosynthesis is needed by nearly all living things to carry out cellular respiration. In addition, primary producers are influential in the global carbon and water cycles. They stabilize coastal areas and can provide habitats for marine animals. The term division has been traditionally used instead of phylum when discussing primary producers, but the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants now accepts both terms as equivalents.\n\nCyanobacteria were the first organisms to evolve an ability to turn sunlight into chemical energy. They form a phylum (division) of bacteria which range from unicellular to filamentous and include colonial species. They are found almost everywhere on earth: in damp soil, in both freshwater and marine environments, and even on Antarctic rocks. In particular, some species occur as drifting cells floating in the ocean, and as such were amongst the first of the phytoplankton.\n\nThe first primary producers that used photosynthesis were oceanic cyanobacteria about 2.3 billion years ago. The release of molecular oxygen by cyanobacteria as a by-product of photosynthesis induced global changes in the Earth's environment. Because oxygen was toxic to most life on Earth at the time, this led to the near-extinction of oxygen-intolerant organisms, a dramatic change which redirected the evolution of the major animal and plant species.\n\nThe tiny marine cyanobacterium \"Prochlorococcus\", discovered in 1986, forms today part of the base of the ocean food chain and accounts for much of the photosynthesis of the open ocean and an estimated 20% of the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere. It is possibly the most plentiful genus on Earth: a single millilitre of surface seawater may contain 100,000 cells or more.\n\nOriginally, biologists classified cyanobacteria as algae, and referred to it as \"blue-green algae\". The more recent view is that cyanobacteria is a bacteria, and hence is not even in the same Kingdom as algae. Most authorities today exclude all prokaryotes, and hence cyanobacteria from the definition of algae.\n\nAlgae is an informal term for a widespread and diverse group of photosynthetic protists which are not necessarily closely related and are thus polyphyletic. Marine algae can be divided into six groups:\n\n\nUnlike higher plants, algae lack roots, stems, or leaves. They can be classified by size as \"microalgae\" or \"macroalgae\".\nMicroalgae are the microscopic types of algae, not visible to the naked eye. They are mostly unicellular species which exist as individuals or in chains or groups, though some are multicellular. Microalgae are important components of the marine protists (discussed above), as well as the phytoplankton (discussed below). They are very diverse. It has been estimated there are 200,000-800,000 species of which about 50,000 species have been described. Depending on the species, their sizes range from a few micrometers (µm) to a few hundred micrometers. They are specially adapted to an environment dominated by viscous forces.\n\nMacroalgae are the larger, multicellular and more visible types of algae, commonly called seaweeds. Seaweeds usually grow in shallow coastal waters where they are anchored to the seafloor by a holdfast. Seaweed that becomes adrift can wash up on beaches. Kelp is a large brown seaweed that forms large underwater forests covering about 25% of the world coastlines. They are among the most productive and dynamic ecosystems on Earth. Some \"Sargassum\" seaweeds are planktonic (free-floating). Like microalgae, macroalgae (seaweeds) are technically marine protists since they are not true plants.\n\nUnicellular organisms are usually microscopic, less than one tenth of a millimeter long. There are exceptions. Mermaid's wineglass, a genus of subtropical green algae, is single-celled but remarkably large and complex in form with a single large nucleus, making it a model organism for studying cell biology. Another single celled algae, \"Caulerpa taxifolia\", has the appearance of a vascular plant including \"leaves\" arranged neatly up stalks like a fern. Selective breeding in aquariums to produce hardier strains resulted in an accidental release into the Mediterranean where it has become an invasive species known colloquially as \"killer algae\".\n\nBack in the Silurian, some phytoplankton evolved into red, brown and green algae. These algae then invaded the land and started evolving into the land plants we know today. Later, in the Cretaceous, some of these land plants returned to the sea as marine plants, such as mangroves and seagrasses.\n\nMarine plants can be found in intertidal zones and shallow waters, such as seagrasses like eelgrass and turtle grass, \"Thalassia\". These plants have adapted to the high salinity of the ocean environment. Plant life can also flourish in the brackish waters of estuaries, where mangroves or cordgrass or beach grass beach grass might grow.\n\nThe total world area of mangrove forests was estimated in 2010 as (based on satellite data). The total world area of seagrass meadows is more difficult to determine, but was conservatively estimated in 2003 as .\n\nMangroves and seagrasses provide important nursery habitats for marine life, acting as hiding and foraging places for larval and juvenile forms of larger fish and invertebrates.\n\n\nPlankton (from Greek for \"wanderers\") are a diverse group of organisms that live in the water column of large bodies of water but cannot swim against a current. As a result, they wander or drift with the currents. Plankton are defined by their ecological niche, not by any phylogenetic or taxonomic classification. They are a crucial source of food for many marine animals, from forage fish to whales. Plankton can be divided into a plant-like component and an animal component.\n\nPhytoplankton are the plant-like components of the plankton community (\"phyto\" comes from the Greek for \"plant\"). They are autotrophic (self-feeding), meaning they generate their own food and do not need to consume other organisms.\n\nPhytoplankton consist mainly of microscopic photosynthetic eukaryotes which inhabit the upper sunlit layer in all oceans. They need sunlight so they can photosynthesize. Most phytoplankton are single-celled algae, but other phytoplankton are bacteria and some are protists. Phytoplankton can be categorised into cyanobacteria (above), diatoms, various other types of algae (red, green, brown, and yellow-green), dinoflagellates, euglenoids, coccolithophorids, cryptomonads, chrysophytes, chlorophytes, prasinophytes, and silicoflagellates. They form the base of the primary production that drives the ocean food web, and account for half of the current global primary production, more than the terrestrial forests.\n\nZooplankton are the animal component of the planktonic community (\"zoo\" comes from the Greek for \"animal\"). They are heterotrophic (other-feeding), meaning they cannot produce their own food and must consume instead other plants or animals as food. In particular, this means they eat phytoplankton.\n\nZooplankton are generally larger than phytoplankton, mostly still microscopic but some can be seen with the naked eye. Many protozoans (single-celled protists that prey on other microscopic life) are zooplankton, including zooflagellates, foraminiferans, radiolarians and some dinoflagellates. Other dinoflagellates are mixotrophic and could also be classified as phytoplankton; the distinction between plants and animals often breaks down in very small organisms. Other zooplankton include pelagic cnidarians, ctenophores, molluscs, arthropods and tunicates, as well as planktonic arrow worms and bristle worms.\n\nRadiolarians are unicellular protists with elaborate silica shells\n\nMicrozooplankton: major grazers of the plankton...\n\nLarger zooplankton can be predatory on smaller zooplankton.\n\nMacrozooplankton...\n\nMany marine animals begin life as zooplankton in the form of eggs or larvae, before they develop into adults. These are meroplanktic, that is, they are planktonic for only part of their life.\n\nDinoflagellates are often mixotrophic or live in symbiosis with other organisms.\n\nSome dinoflagellates are bioluminescent. At night, ocean water can light up internally and sparkle with blue light because of these dinoflagellates. Bioluminescent dinoflagellates possess scintillons, individual cytoplasmic bodies which contain dinoflagellate luciferase, the main enzyme involved in the luminescence. The luminescence, sometimes called \"the phosphorescence of the sea\", occurs as brief (0.1 sec) blue flashes or sparks when individual scintillons are stimulated, usually by mechanical disturbances from, for example, a boat or a swimmer or surf.\n\nCompared to terrestrial environments, marine environments have biomass pyramids which are inverted at the base. In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are tiny phytoplankton which tend to be r-strategists that grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, are often K-strategists that grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nBecause of this inversion, it is the zooplankton that make up most of the marine animal biomass. As primary consumers, they are the crucial link between the primary producers (mainly phytoplankton) and the rest of the marine food web (secondary consumers).\n\nIf phytoplankton dies before it is eaten, it descends through the euphotic zone as part of the marine snow and settles into the depths of sea. In this way, phytoplankton sequester about 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the ocean each year, causing the ocean to become a sink of carbon dioxide holding about 90% of all sequestered carbon.\n\nIn 2010 researchers found whales carry nutrients from the depths of the ocean back to the surface using a process they called the whale pump. Whales feed at deeper levels in the ocean where krill is found, but return regularly to the surface to breathe. There whales defecate a liquid rich in nitrogen and iron. Instead of sinking, the liquid stays at the surface where phytoplankton consume it. In the Gulf of Maine the whale pump provides more nitrogen than the rivers.\n\nSediments at the bottom of the ocean have two main origins, terrigenous and biogenous. Terrigenous sediments account for about 45% of the total marine sediment, and originate in the erosion of rocks on land, transported by rivers and land runoff, windborne dust, volcanoes, or grinding by glaciers.\n\nBiogenous sediments account for the other 55% of the total sediment, and originate in the skeletal remains of marine protists (single-celled plankton and benthos organisms). Much smaller amounts of precipitated minerals and meteoric dust can also be present. \"Ooze\", in the context of a marine sediment, does not refer to the consistency of the sediment but to its biological origin. The term ooze was originally used by John Murray, the \"father of modern oceanography\", who proposed the term \"radiolarian ooze\" for the silica deposits of radiolarian shells brought to the surface during the Challenger Expedition. A \"biogenic ooze\" is a pelagic sediment containing at least 30 percent from the skeletal remains of marine organisms.\n\nLand interactions impact marine life in many ways. Coastlines typically have continental shelves extending some way from the shore. These provide extensive shallows sunlit down to the seafloor, allowing for photosynthesis and enabling habitats for seagrass meadows, coral reefs, kelp forests and other benthic life. Further from shore the continental shelf slopes towards deep water. Wind blowing at the ocean surface or deep ocean currents can result in cold and nutrient rich waters from abyssal depths moving up the continental slopes. This can result in upwellings along the outer edges of continental shelves, providing conditions for phytoplankton blooms.\n\nWater evaporated by the sun from the surface of the ocean can precipitate on land and eventually return to the ocean as runoff or discharge from rivers, enriched with nutrients as well as pollutants. As rivers discharge into estuaries, freshwater mixes with saltwater and becomes brackish. This provides another shallow water habitat where mangrove forests and estuarine fish thrive. Overall, life in inland lakes can evolve with greater diversity than happens in the sea, because freshwater habitats are themselves diverse and compartmentalised in a way marine habitats are not. Some aquatic life, such as salmon and eels, migrate back and forth between freshwater and marine habitats. These migrations can result in exchanges of pathogens and have impacts on the way life evolves in the ocean.\n\nHuman activities affect marine life and marine habitats through overfishing, pollution, acidification and the introduction of invasive species. These impact marine ecosystems and food webs and may result in consequences as yet unrecognised for the biodiversity and continuation of marine life forms.\n\nBiodiversity is the result of over three billion years of evolution. Until approximately 600 million years ago, all life consisted of archaea, bacteria, protozoans and similar single-celled organisms. The history of biodiversity during the Phanerozoic (the last 540 million years), starts with rapid growth during the Cambrian explosion – a period during which nearly every phylum of multicellular organisms first appeared. Over the next 400 million years or so, invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend.\n\nHowever, more than 99 percent of all species that ever lived on Earth, amounting to over five billion species, are estimated to be extinct. These extinctions occur at an uneven rate. The dramatic rise in diversity has been marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as mass extinction events. Mass extinction events occur when life undergoes precipitous global declines. Most diversity and biomass on earth is found among the microorganisms, which are difficult to measure. Recorded extinction events are therefore based on the more easily observed changes in the diversity and abundance of larger multicellular organisms, rather than the total diversity and abundance of life. Marine fossils are mostly used to measure extinction rates because of their superior fossil record and stratigraphic range compared to land organisms.\n\nBased on the fossil record, the background rate of extinctions on Earth is about two to five taxonomic families of marine animals every million years. The Great Oxygenation Event was perhaps the first major extinction event. Since the Cambrian explosion five further major mass extinctions have significantly exceeded the background extinction rate. The worst was the Permian-Triassic extinction event, 251 million years ago. Vertebrates took 30 million years to recover from this event. In addition to these major mass extinctions there are numerous minor ones, as well as the current ongoing mass-extinction caused by human activity, the Holocene extinction sometimes called the \"sixth extinction\".\n\nDuring the sixth century BC, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes (570-475 BC) recognised that some fossil shells were remains of shellfish. He used this to argue that what was at the time dry land was once under the sea. This was an important step in advancing from simply stating an idea to backing it with evidence and observation.\n\nLater, during the fourth century BC, another Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC) attempted a comprehensive classification of animals which included systematic descriptions of many marine species, and particularly species found in the Mediterranean Sea. These pioneering works include \"History of Animals\", a general biology of animals, \"Parts of Animals\", a comparative anatomy and physiology of animals, and \"Generation of Animals\", on developmental biology. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on catfish, electric fish (\"Torpedo\") and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on cephalopods, namely, \"Octopus\", \"Sepia\" (cuttlefish) and the paper nautilus (\"Argonauta argo\"). His description of the hectocotyl arm, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of a group he called Selachē (selachians). He gave accurate descriptions of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark \"Mustelus mustelus\". His classification of living things contains elements which were still in use in the 19th century. What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called \"animals with blood\" and \"animals without blood\" (he did not know that complex invertebrates do make use of hemoglobin, but of a different kind from vertebrates). He divided animals with blood into live-bearing (mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates (\"animals without blood\") he divided into insects, crustacea (further divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs).\n\nIn contemporary times, marine life is a field of study both in marine biology and in biological oceanography. In biology many phyla, families and genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land. Marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy. For this reason marine biology encompasses not only organisms that live only in a marine environment, but also other organisms whose lives revolve around the sea. Biological oceanography is the study of how organisms affect and are affected by the physics, chemistry, and geology of the oceanographic system. Biological oceanography mostly focuses on the microorganisms within the ocean; looking at how they are affected by their environment and how that affects larger marine creatures and their ecosystem. Biological oceanography is similar to marine biology, but it studies ocean life from a different perspective. Biological oceanography takes a bottom up approach in terms of the food web, while marine biology studies the ocean from a top down perspective. Biological oceanography mainly focuses on the ecosystem of the ocean with an emphasis on plankton: their diversity (morphology, nutritional sources, motility, and metabolism); their productivity and how that plays a role in the global carbon cycle; and their distribution (predation and life cycle). Biological oceanography also investigates the role of microbes in food webs, and how humans impact the ecosystems in the oceans.\n\n\n"}

His name literally means \"eight bends\", reflecting the eight physical handicaps he was born with. His maternal grandfather was the Vedic sage Aruni, his parents were both Vedic students at Aruni's school. Ashtavakra studied, became a sage and a celebrated character of the Hindu History(Itihas) Epics and Puranas.\n\nAshtavakra is the author of the text \"Aṣṭāvakra Gītā\", also known as \"Aṣṭāvakra Saṃhitā\", in Hindu traditions. The text is a treatise on Brahman and Atman.\n\nLittle is known about the life or century in which Ashtavakra actually lived, except for the History(Itihas) found in the major Indian Epics (the \"Ramayana\" and the \"Mahabharata\") and the Puranas. The legends state that sage Aruni, mentioned in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, ran a school (Āśrama) teaching the Vedas. Kahoḍa was one of his students, along with Aruni's daughter Sujata. Aruni's daughter married Kahoḍa. She got pregnant, and during her pregnancy, the developing baby heard the chanting of the Vedas and learnt the correct recitation. According to one version of the legends surrounding Ashtavakra, his father was once reciting the Vedas, but erred in correct intonation. The fetus spoke from the womb and asked his father to correct the eight mistakes that he was doing while reciting the Vedic Mantras. The father got angry and cursed him to be born with eight deformities, hence the name 'Ashtavakra'.\n\nHis father Kahoda, once went for riches unto Janaka, the ancient king of Videha, for his family as they were poor. He was there defeated in science of arguments by Vandin, and in consequence was immersed in water. Hearing of the drowning of her husband, she kept it secret from her child. When Ashtavakra grew up, he learned everything about his curse and his father. Then he asked his mother to come with him to witness the great sacrifice of king Janaka. He was stopped from entering the king sacrifice as only learned Brahamanas and Kings were allowed to enter, and he was just in his tenth year. With the proficiency of art of speaking, he made the king amazed with the knowledge he possessed, so was allowed to enter. There he challenged the Vandin for controversy. After a severe argument he defeated Vandin in knowledge by words. And asked the king, as Vandin used to cast Brahamanas into water, let him meet with same fate. Vandin then revealed that he is the son of Varun, and explained that the reason he drowned those Brahmins was a ritual that his father is performing from twelve years and needed a large number of Brahmins. By then, the ritual was done and thus all the Brahamins he drowned were freed. His father was very impressed from his son, and while going back home asked him to take a dip in the river 'Samanga'. As Ashtavakra came out of the river, all of his deformities were cured.\n\nAṣṭāvakra is credited as the author of the Ashtavakra Gita (IAST: Aṣṭāvakra Gītā), which means \"song of Ashtavakra\". The text is also known as \"Aṣṭāvakra Saṃhitā\". The \"Ashtavakra Gita\" examines the metaphysical nature of existence and the meaning of individual freedom, presenting its thesis that there is only one Supreme Reality (Brahman), the entirety of universe is oneness and manifestation of this reality, everything is interconnected, all Self (Atman, soul) are part of that one, and that individual freedom is not the end point but a given, a starting point, innate.\n\nAccording to Jessica Wilson, the Sanskrit poetics in \"Ashtavakra Gita\" is not driven by critical syllogism, but it is rich in philosophical premises, spiritual effectiveness and its resonant narrative because of \"textual indeterminacy between the audience's disposition and the foregrounded theme of non-individuation in the text. This tension . . . results in consistency building by the audience, which enables the transcendence of these two viewpoints (reader and text)\".\n\nAccording to Radhakamal Mukerjee, the \"Ashtavakra Gita\" was likely composed after the \"Bhagavad Gita\" but before the start of the common era, and attributed to sage Ashtavakra out of reverence for his ideas.\n\nAṣṭāvakra is referenced in verse 6.119.17 of Yuddha Kāṇḍa in Vālmikī's Rāmāyaṇa. When Daśaratha comes to see Rāma from heaven after the war of the Rāmāyaṇa, he tells Rāma –\n\nIn the \"Aranya Kanda\" of Adhyatma Ramayana, the demon Kabandha narrates his story to Rama and Lakshmana, in which he says that he was a Gandharva earlier who was cursed by Ashtavakra to become a demon when he laughed on seeing him (Ashtavakra). When the Gandharva then bowed down to Ashtavakra, Ashtavakra said that he would be released from the curse by Rama in Treta Yuga.\n\nIn the Vana Parva of the Mahābhārata, the legend of Aṣṭāvakra is described in greater detail. On losing the game of dice with the Kauravas, the five Pāṇḍava princes and Draupadi are exiled for twelve years. On their pilgrimage, they meet the sage Lomaśa, and he narrates to the Pāṇḍava princes the legend of Aṣṭāvakra, over three chapters of Vana Parva of the Mahābhārata. Aṣṭāvakra's wisdom on various aspects of human existence is recited in the Mahābhārata. For example:\nAṣṭāvakra and Śvetaketu made his way to Janaka's palace. Aṣṭāvakra first faced the gatekeeper who tried to keep the young boy out. On convincing the gatekeeper that he was well versed in the scriptures and hence old, he was let in. Then Janaka tested Aṣṭāvakra with cryptic questions which Aṣṭāvakra answered with ease. Janaka decided to let Aṣṭāvakra face Vandin. Vandin and Aṣṭāvakra began the debate, with Vandin starting. They alternately composed six extempore verses on the numbers one to twelve. Then Vandin could only compose the first half of a verse on the number thirteen. Aṣṭāvakra completed the verse by composing the second half and thus won the argument against Vandin. This unique debate is full of enigmas and latent meanings which lie under the simple counts of the numbers one to thirteen.\n\n\n\n\nhttp://oshosearch.net/Convert/Articles_Osho/The_Mahageeta_Volume_1/Osho-The-Mahageeta-Volume-1-00000004.html\n"}

It was previously overshadowed by the nearby settlement of Gura, which was the location of several battles (including a major one during the 19th century Ethio-Egyptian War) and previously gave its name to Dequ-Mehari's valley. Following their invasion, the Italians devoted significant resources into developing Gura and Dekemhare as an important transportation center. Gura received an air base and a major road was built connecting Dekamhare with the port Nefasit. The Italians built a number of contemporary services in the town. The town became a major base of operations for the Italian military in the war against Ethiopia. The town became a key agricultural center for Italian East Africa, mainly with wine vineyards, but also pasta and bread factories.\nThe Italian influence was significant and many buildings built between 1936 and 1938 display a distinctive art deco style. In 1938, the town had 12,000 residents, including 6,000 permanent Italian residents. \n\nDuring World War II, as the British took control over the region, many of the Italian residents left.

{"id": "2056590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056590", "title": "Rajm", "text": "Rajm\n\nRajm () is an Arabic word that means \"stoning\". It is commonly used to refer to the \"Hudud\" punishment wherein an organized group throws stones at a convicted individual until that person dies. Under some versions of Islamic law (Sharia), it is the prescribed punishment in cases of adultery committed by a married man or married woman. The conviction requires a confession from either the adulterer/adulteress, or the testimony of two/three witnesses (as prescribed by Quran 24:4), or pregnancy outside of marriage.\n\nThe punishment of stoning/\"Rajm\" or capital punishment for adultery is unique in Islamic law in that it conflicts with the Qur'anic prescription for premarital and extramarital sex (zina) found in Surah an-Nur,2: \"The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication — flog each of them with a hundred stripes\". \nFor this reason some minority Muslim sects such as Kharijites found in Iraq, and Islamic Modernists such as the Quranists disagree with the legality of \"rajm\".\n\nHowever, stoning is mentioned in multiple hadiths (reports claiming to quote what Muhammad said verbatim on various matters, which most Muslims and Islamic scholars consider an authoritative source second only to Quran as a source of religious law), and therefore most schools of Islamic jurisprudence accept it as a prescribed punishment for adultery. The punishment has been rarely applied in the history of Islam owing to the very strict evidential requirements stipulated by Islamic law.\n\nAt least a couple of sources (Sadakat Kadri, Max Rodenbeck) have noted that while popular in the abstract, \"rajm\" has been infrequently applied in Islamic history. Stonings were recorded just once in all the history of Ottoman Empire, and not at all in Syria during Muslim rule;) Techniques used to \"minimize the possibility\" that the pregnancy of a single woman would be considered evidence of zina and make justice more merciful, included \"fantastic presumptions\" about the length of the human gestation period. Classical Hanafite jurists ruling that rather than nine months, it could last for up to two years, Shafi'ites four, and Malikites as long as five years. Rashidun Caliph Umar once acquitted a pregnant single mother on the grounds that she was a \"heavy sleeper\" who had had \"intercourse without realizing it\".\n\nAccording to journalist Max Rodenbeck,\n\nIn almost all cases where it has been applied in recent years, stoning has taken place in tribal or rebel areas beyond the control of central governments—the Taliban in Afghanistan, ISIS in Iraq, and Boko Haram in Nigeria being cases in point. Out of the world’s forty-nine Muslim-majority states, six retain the punishment in deference to Islamic legal tradition, ... Of these countries only Iran, which officially placed a moratorium on stoning in 2002 but still gives leeway to individual judges, has actually carried it out.\nSaudi Arabia executed four people by stoning during the 1980s.\nAs of 2005, stoning punishments have been considered or handed down in Nigeria and Somalia for the crimes of adultery and sodomy (homosexuality). Since the Sharia legal system was introduced in northern Nigeria in 2000, more than a dozen Muslims have been sentenced to death by stoning but none have actually been stoned. In one case, an appellate court in the state of Sokoto overturned a stoning sentence on the basis that divorced defendant might not have conceived her child in zina (fornication) because she may have been carrying her baby for as long as five years. Another Nigerian state court of appeal assessed the upper limit of gestation at seven years.\n\nIn Pakistan \"more than three decades of official Islamization have so far failed to produce a single actual stoning...\" Iran officially placed a moratorium on stoning in 2002 but still gives leeway to individual judges to sentence \"rajm\". The failure to carry out sentences of \"rajm\" has been blamed on publicity and pressure from internal and international human rights groups, which considers stoning a form of execution by torture.\n\nFrom July 2014 to February 2015, at least 15 people (six men and nine women) were executed (not all by \"rajm\") by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Syria for the crimes of adultery or homosexuality, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\n'Umar, the second caliph, is reported to have stated that \"the Verse of Rajm\" was once recited as part of the Quran. \nAnother explanation for why rajm is not mentioned in the Quran comes from a report credited to Muhammad's wife Aisha:\n[Narrated 'Aisha] \"The verse of the stoning and of suckling an adult ten times were revealed, and they were (written) on a paper and kept under my bed. When the messenger of Allah passed away and we were preoccupied with his death, a goat entered and ate away the paper.\"\n\n(Most Muslim scholars have rejected this hadith as Mawdoo (fabricated) because the common routes of transmission of it either contain narrators charged with dishonesty when disclosing their sources, or (in the case of the version in Ibn Hanbal's Musnad) conflict with all versions of the hadith which bear authentic routes — none of which mention the goat eating the piece of paper.).\n\nNumerous Sahih (reliable, according to Sunni scholars) hadiths, however, describe stoning. One is the Hadith of Umar's speech of forbidding Mut'ah, Muhammad's last Hajj sermon and the \"Hadith\" of the Verse of Stoning.\n\nThe hadith Sahih Bukhari, the book most trusted after Quran by most Muslims, has several sunnah regarding stoning. For example,\n\nSahih Muslim Book 17 has several hadith regarding Stoning specifically (17:4191-4209, and 17:4914). For example,\nOther hadiths also mention stoning as the punishment for adultery.\nThe early Islamic era text Musannaf of Abd al-Razzaq, in the chapter on \"Rajm\", lists 70 hadith reports of stoning linked to Muhammad, and 100 to his companions and other authorities.\n\n\"Rajm\", sometimes spelled as \"Rajam\", has been extensively discussed in the texts of early, medieval and modern era Islamic jurisprudence (fiqhs).\n\nPersons who accuse a woman of adultery but are not able to bring four witnesses—a crime known as \"Qadhf\", القذف —are liable to a punishment of 80 lashes and to be unacceptable as witnesses unless they repent and reform. The testimony of a man who accuses his own spouse without any other witnesses may be accepted if they swear by God four times that they are telling the truth with a fifth oath to incur God's condemnation if they be lying. In this case, if his spouse counterswears, no punishment will be enforced.\nOne of the widely followed Islamic legal commentaries, \"Al-Muwatta\" by Malik ibn Anas, state that contested pregnancy is sufficient proof of adultery and the woman must be stoned to death.\n\nHanafi jurists have held that the accused must be a \"muhsan\" at the time of religiously disallowed sex to be punished by \"Rajm\" (stoning). A \"Muhsan\" is an adult, free, Muslim who has previously enjoyed legitimate sexual relations in matrimony, regardless of whether the marriage still exists. In other words, stoning does not apply to someone who was never married in his or her life (only lashing in public is the mandatory punishment in such cases).\n\nFor evidence, Hanafi fiqh accepts the following: self-confession, or testimony of four male witnesses (female witnesses are not acceptable). Hanafi Islamic law literature specifies two types of stoning. One, when the punishment is based on \"bayyina\", or concrete evidence (four male witnesses). In this case the person is bound, a pit dug, the bound person placed and partially buried inside the pit so that he or she may not escape, thereafter the public stoning punishment is executed. A woman sentenced to stoning must be partially buried up to her chest. The first stones are thrown by the witnesses and the accuser, thereafter the Muslim community present, stated Abū Ḥanīfa and other Hanafi scholars. In second type of stoning, when the punishment is based on self-confession, the stoning is to be performed without digging a pit or partially burying the person. In this case, the qadi (judge) should throw the first stone before other Muslims join in. Further, if the person flees, the person is allowed to leave.\n\nHanafi scholars specify the stone size to be used for \"Rajm\", to be the size of one's hand. It should not be too large to cause death too quickly, nor too small to extend only pain.\n\nHanafites have traditionally held that the witnesses should throw the first stones in case the conviction was brought about by witnesses, and the \"qadi\" must throw the first stones in case the conviction was brought about by a confession.\n\nThe Shafii school literature has the same Islamic law analysis as the Hanafi. However, it recommends, that the first stone be thrown by the Imam or his deputy in all cases, followed by the Muslim community witnessing the stoning punishment.\n\nHanbali jurist Ibn Qudamah states, \"Muslim jurists are unanimous on the fact that stoning to death is a specified punishment for the married adulterer and adulteress. The punishment is recorded in number of traditions and the practice of Muhammad stands as an authentic source supporting it. This is the view held by all Companions, Successors and other Muslim scholars with the exception of Kharijites.\"\n\nHanbali Islamic law sentences all forms of consensual but religiously illegal sex as punishable with \"Rajm\". However, Hanabali scholars insist that homosexuality among men must be punished by beheading, instead of \"Rajm\" as recommended by the Maliki madhab of Islam.\n\nMaliki school of jurisprudence (fiqh) holds that stoning is the required punishment for illegal sex by a married or widowed person, as well as for any form of homosexual relations among men. Malik ibn Anas, founded of Maliki fiqh, considered pregnancy in an unmarried woman as a conclusive proof of zina. He also stated that contested pregnancy is also sufficient proof of adultery and any Muslim woman who is pregnant by a man who she is not married to, at the time of getting pregnant, must be stoned to death. Later Maliki Muslim scholars admitted the concept of \"sleeping embryo\", where a divorced woman could escape the stoning punishment, if she remained unmarried and became pregnant anytime within five years of her divorce, and it was assumed that she was impregnated by her previous husband but the embryo remained dormant for five years.\n\nAll Sunni fiqhs, as well as Volume 7 of the Shi'ite hadith, \"The Book of Legal Penalties\" in Kitab al-Kafi, declare stoning as the required punishment for sex that is not allowed under Sharia.\n\nIn contrast to Sunni schools, Shia Islamic law, in \"Rajm\" cases, allows some of the witnesses to be women but considers the witness of a woman as half as valid as a man's. Thus, before an accused is sentenced to \"Rajm\" in Shia system, the witnesses may be four men, three men and two women, two men and four women, one man and six women, but witnesses must include at least one man. Furthermore, Shia jurists grant discretionary powers to the judge in cases of homosexuality, to sentence the accused to death by sword, \"Rajm\" (death by stoning), death by throwing from a high wall, or burning the accused to death.\n\nThere is disagreement among modern Islamic thinkers as to the applicability of stoning for adultery. While religious texts often give examples both with and without stoning, the Quran does not prescribe stoning as a punishment for any crime, mentioning only lashing as punishment for adultery. However most scholars maintain that there is sufficient evidence from hadiths to derive a ruling. The vast majority of Muslims consider hadiths, which describe the words, conduct and example set by Muhammad during his life, as a source of law and religious authority second only to the Quran. They consider sahih hadiths to be a valid source of Sharia, justifying their belief on Quranic verse 33.21, and other verses.\n\nThe reliability of Hadith is disputed by Quranist Muslims who reject all Hadith, and as a consequence the Rajm punishment as well.\n\nEnayatullah Asad Subhani argues that \"Rajm\" is not the punishment of the fornication, as generally been understood, and it is not among the \"Hudood\" either. His book Haqeeqat-e-Rajm was widely criticized by the ulama as he had tried to clear doubts against the punishments prescribed by Islam for different crimes. \nJaved Ahmad Ghamidi postulates that Quranic verses prescribe \"Rajm\" only for those who habitually commit fornication as prostitutes do, which then constitute \"mischief in the land\" that is punishable by death according to Quranic verses 5:33-34. This view is not popular and does not enjoy acceptance by most ulema.\n\n\n"}

It draws together the views of a wide range of organisations including conservation and environmental groups, community groups and trade unions, and operates as the Campaign for Better Transport Ltd and as the Campaign for Better Transport Charitable Trust (a registered charity) of which Jenny Agutter, Steve Norris and Tracy Marchioness of Worcester are patrons. Darren Shirley is Chief Executive Officer.\n\n\"Transport 2000\" was formed in 1972, and officially launched on 6 February 1973, by various railway workers' unions and environmental pressure groups as a reaction to a newspaper disclosure that one of the options in a report for the Department of the Environment was the possible closure of a large part of the rail network. The National Union of Railwaymen instigated a meeting with other concerned parties where they agreed to form \"Transport 2000\" with 14 affiliated organisations, many of which are still associated with the organisation.\n\nMichael Palin was appointed as chairman in 1986 and then as president in 1988, the same year that Stephen Joseph was appointed as Executive Director. Joseph received an OBE for \"services to transport and the environment\" in 1996.\n\nIn 1998 Transport 2000 was part of a coalition of organisations which jointly launched the Slower Speeds Initiative which campaigns in favour of traffic calming, lower speeds and better enforcement of existing speed limits. Although a founding member, the organisation now focuses less on speed reduction in favour of other campaigns.\n\nIn 2006 \"The Times\" reported that Palin was facing moves to oust him as president because of his passion for long-distance air travel. They calculated that he had flown more than a quarter of a million miles in the previous 17 years while making his six TV series. The organisation denied any such suggestion saying \"Michael Palin brings popular appeal, wisdom and a sense of proportion to the transport problems we as a society face today\". \"The Daily Telegraph\" also covered the story in their motoring section, initially claiming that over half of the organisation's funding came from the bus and rail sector, but then correcting the figure as 20%.\n\nIn 2007 the organisation changed its name to Campaign for Better Transport and re-focused its campaigns and appointed Rebecca Lush as 'Roads and Climate campaigner'. Lush was a long-time roads campaigner and founder of Road Block, an organisation which supported local groups that were resisting road schemes and which became a project within the organisation at the same time. Other former members of staff include Richard George, previously Campaigns Coordinator at CTC, the national cyclists' organisation and co-founder of Plane Stupid.\n\n, the organisation ran two major campaigns.\n\nRoads to Nowhere promotes alternatives to road-building projects that the Campaign for Better Transport deem to be damaging. They assert that these projects \"generate even more traffic, damage the countryside, add to climate change and make cities, towns and villages less pleasant places to live.\" The campaign includes an interactive map tracking proposed road schemes across the country.\n\nSave our Buses makes the case for local buses to government decision-makers whilst supporting bus campaigners to fight cuts to services in their area. The campaign features an interactive map tracking bus cuts in England.\n\nThe organisation in a member of the 'Freight on Rail' partnership.\n\nCampaign for Better Transport is affiliated to the following organisations: Amicus, Association of Community Rail Partnerships, Bus Users UK, Campaign to Protect Rural England, Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales, Civic Trust, Community Transport Association, Campaign for National Parks, Cycle Campaign Network, Cyclists Touring Club, Environmental Transport Association, Friends of the Earth, GMB, Light Rail Transit Association, Living Streets, National Council on Inland Transport, National Federation of Women’s Institutes, National Trust, Railfuture, Ramblers' Association, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, SERA, Sustrans, Town and Country Planning Association, Wildlife Trusts, Woodland Trust, WWF-UK, UK Noise Association and Youth Hostels Association.\n\nIts income was £900,000 in 2006-2007, coming from charitable trusts, transport operators, transport authorities, trade unions and individual donors.\n\nCampaign for Better Transport acknowledges the following organisations as sponsors of its limited company: ACIS, Arriva Passenger Services, ASLEF, Chiltern Railways, Ecology Building Society, EWS, Eurostar, FirstGroup, Freightliner, Gloucestershire County Council, Go-Ahead Group, Hertfordshire County Council, Lush Ltd, National Express, NedRailways, Network Rail, Nottinghamshire County Council, Passenger Transport Executive Group, Rail Freight Group, Railway Industry Association, Railway Forum, Reading Borough Council, RMT, Serco Integrated Transport, Stagecoach, Telford and Wrekin Borough Council, Transport for London, Transdev, TSSA and Unison and Unite-Amicus.\n\nCampaign for Better Transport acknowledges the following organisations as sponsors of its charitable trust: Department for Transport, Esmée Fairbairn Foundation, Freshfield Foundation, George W Cadbury Charitable Trust, Gumby Corporation, Hillcote Trust, KeyMed Ltd, London Councils, Merseytravel, Polden Puckham Charitable Foundation, Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts and Steel Charitable Trust.\n"}

There are minor technical differences between 97650 and the 1959 batch.\n\nThis class of five locomotives is outwardly similar to the Class 04 locomotives built around the same time but, internally, they are quite different. The Class 97/6 is diesel-electric while the Class 04 is diesel-mechanical.\n\nThe fleet was originally numbered PWM650-654 in the Western Region Permanent Way Machines series, hence were commonly referred to as the “PWM shunters” or simply “PWMs”. Between 1979 and 1981 they were renumbered as Class 97 locomotives. Originally painted in BR Green livery, this was later superseded by BR Blue and finally Civil Engineering Yellow. They were employed at various locations, including Reading West (97650/653/654), Gloucester / Cardiff Canton / Radyr (97651) and Plymouth Laira (97652).\n\n\nA special feature of this class is that the electric traction motor can be disengaged from the wheels. This allows the locomotive to be hauled by another locomotive at speeds above 20 mph.\n\nWith the privatisation of British Rail these locomotives were largely made redundant. Three locomotives had already been withdrawn from traffic, and only nos. 97651 and 97654 survived long enough to pass into English Welsh & Scottish (EWS) ownership. Number 97654 was sold to an infrastructure company based in Edinburgh, and remained in use until 2005, when it was preserved. Number 97651 was one of the first locomotives sold by EWS into preservation.\n\nThree of the five locomotives have been preserved on heritage railways.\n\nIncomplete remains of 97653 were stored at the former Ministry of Defence depot at Long Marston, Warwickshire until taken to Hurst's, Andover for scrap in August 2011.\n\n<br>\n\n"}

It was written by Jenji Kohan and directed by series producer James Burrows. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in the United States on April 25, 2002. Michael Douglas, Molly Shannon, and Barry Livingston guest starred in \"Fagel Attraction\".\n\nIn the episode, Will (Eric McCormack) files a police report after his laptop computer is stolen. He then meets a police detective (Douglas) who takes a special interest in his case as they go undercover—however, Will does not know that the detective participates in Jack's (Sean Hayes) therapy group for gays. Meanwhile, Grace (Debra Messing) is once again hassled by her kleptomaniac neighbor Val (Shannon) who opens a rival design business and prospers by stealing Grace's ideas.\n\nSince airing, \"Fagel Attraction\" has received positive reviews from television critics. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode was watched by 14.3 million households during its original broadcast. Douglas was mostly praised from critics for his performance and received an Emmy Award nomination in the \"Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series\" category.\n\nFollowing the theft of Will's (Eric McCormack) laptop computer, detective Gavin Hatch (Michael Douglas) assures Will he will do everything he can to get his laptop back. Upon meeting Will, Gavin becomes attracted to him. Instead of asking him out on a date, due to fear of rejection, Gavin makes up an elaborate story that Will's laptop theft was part of a \"gay laptop-theft ring.\" Meanwhile, at Grace Adler Designs, Grace (Debra Messing) is showing some designs to a potential client, Vince (Barry Livingston). He is fond of her work and would like to become her client, but reveals that he promised another designer he would listen to her ideas too. Grace becomes horrified when she learns that her kleptomaniac neighbor and nemesis, Val (Molly Shannon), is the other designer.\n\nMeanwhile, Will and Gavin go undercover at a gay nightclub. Will believes they are doing police business for the \"gay laptop-theft ring\", but it is actually a date planned by Gavin. Jack (Sean Hayes), a friend of Will's, sees the two dancing and is dumbfounded. Jack and Gavin attend the same gay therapy group, and the two dislike one another, which leads Jack to tell Will all he knows about Gavin. At Will's apartment, Gavin reveals to Will that he is gay, after Will admits to having a liking to him, but that he is \"barking up the wrong tree.\" Will, however, identifies Gavin's problem with asking men out and his knack of making stories up to spend time with them. Before Gavin leaves, Will tells him to face his fears.\n\nAt Grace Adler Designs, Val suggests she and Grace integrate their presentations in the same meeting with Vince, to which Grace agrees. In the middle of Grace's presentation, Val begins repeating the same thing Grace says. This leads to the two bickering, which prompts Karen (Megan Mullally), Grace's friend and socialite assistant, to pull them apart. She tells them that violence is never the answer, \"but sometimes it is,\" then chops Val behind the neck, rendering Val unconscious. Karen tells Grace to go get Vince, who was out of the room, while she gets \"rid\" of Val's body.\n\n\"Fagel Attraction\" was written by Jenji Kohan and directed by series producer James Burrows. The episode's title is a reference to the 1987 film \"Fatal Attraction\" which starred actor Michael Douglas. In March 2002, it was announced that Michael Douglas would guest star on the show, playing a gay detective who becomes attracted to Will. His role on the show was his first television acting role in almost 30 years, since his role in the police drama \"The Streets of San Francisco\". It was also confirmed that actress Molly Shannon would reprise her role as Val, Grace's nemesis. This was Shannon's fourth appearance on the show.\n\nWhile in negotiations, Douglas' staff approached the show's producers about a guest spot for Douglas and the sitcom's executives sought to work against Douglas' image. His management team wanted him to stretch beyond his usual roles, and believed a successful comedy show like \"Will & Grace\" would be a good way to do so. The show's producers said that Douglas was willing to go with any story line the writers could come up with. Executive producer and co-creator of the show, David Kohan said: \"There's something great about playing on a person's iconic status. [...] Michael Douglas often plays these virile men, and the idea of making him a gay cop too shy to ask Will out was funny.\"\n\nHowever, in another interview, it was revealed that Douglas himself called the show's producers to ask them about a guest appearance. \"I am a big fan of the show, so when the opportunity to guest-star came along, I had to grab it\", Douglas said on his official website. \"It's been awhile since I've performed in front of a live audience, and it was great to flex that old theater acting muscle. It was also my first experience with a television sitcom.\"\n\nIn its original American broadcast, \"Fagel Attraction\" was watched by 14.3 million households, according to Nielsen ratings. It received a 10.3 rating/15 share among viewers in the 18–49 demographic, and was the seventh highest-rated show on the NBC network that week. \"Fagel Attraction\" has received mostly positive reviews from television critics since airing, and several reviewers praised Douglas for his appearance. Debra Messing, who plays Grace, commented that it was \"hilarious how easily\" Douglas played his character in the episode. In 2002, he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the \"Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series\" category for this episode, but lost to Anthony LaPaglia of \"Frasier\". In March 2006, \"Entertainment Weekly\" named Douglas' guest spot the fourth most memorable guest appearance on \"Will & Grace\".\nKevin McDonough of \"Charleston Daily Mail\" called Douglas' appearance an \"unforgettable performance\", and Adam Buckman of the \"New York Post\" commented that Douglas is \"such a commanding presence on screen\" that he \"steals every scene\". Renée Peck of \"The Times-Picayune\" reported that she enjoyed watching Douglas have fun with an \"off-the-wall\" role combining an alternate lifestyle with altered consciousness. \"TV Guide\" contributor Matt Roush, in review of season four, said that without guest appearances from actors such as Douglas, the season \"would be an awfully sad misfire.\" Mark A. Perigard of the \"Boston Herald\" wrote that the \"biggest laughs\" in the episode come when Douglas holds hands with Will and then dances with him. Alan Pergament of \"The Buffalo News\" also praised this sequence, calling it \"priceless\".\n\nThe episode received less positive reviews as well. Allan Johnson of the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote that the episode is good, but not great: \"It proves stunt-casting doesn't necessarily work unless the actor is up to the script and lead performers. And Douglas, an otherwise fine actor, basically does a caricature of a macho gay man.\" Ted Cox of the \"Daily Herald\" wrote that the idea of Douglas being cast as a neurotic gay man \"isn't a whole lot to this episode.\" A television reviewer from \"Deseret News\" thought that because of his role on \"Will & Grace\", Douglas should give the Oscar he won earlier in his career back. The reviewer concluded: \"He's embarrassingly bad, as is this episode.\"\n\nJohnson was complimentary towards Molly Shannon: \"Far funnier is a subplot with Molly Shannon of \"Saturday Night Live\" back as Will and Grace's (Messing) whacked-out neighbor Val [...] Shannon, always funny and fun to watch, isn't a mere stunt ... Shannon shows a guest actor can shine when paired with the right character.\" \"The Palm Beach Post\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Kevin D. Thompson wrote that Shannon's performance \"displays why she should have her own sitcom\", while Cox wrote that she has a \"quality in which a tightly bound surface normalcy seems to barely contain a bundle of tics and impulses, and the writers make excellent use of it by having Val try to first steal Grace's flair for design, then cop one of her clients.\" Perigard noted that Grace and Val's storyline made it \"clear that the producers just like the sight of the two women flailing their arms in a mock catfight.\"\n\n"}

In the 1960s, following the incorporation of Eritrea into Ethiopia, the construction of a police post and Mosque in the town was funded by the government of Emperor Haile Selasie. The police presence made it the target of early attacks by the Eritrean Liberation Front and led to the Ethiopians establishing a military garrison there in 1967.\n\nIn 1977, after a six-month siege, the Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front, EPLF, took Nakfa from the Ethiopians in its first major victory. For the next decade it was to serve as the major base of the EPLF and was subjected to eight, failed attempts by the Ethiopians to retake it, during which most of the town was destroyed, other than the mosque which served as a useful navigation beacon for Ethiopian bombers. The EPLF dug itself in underground where it built hospitals, printing presses, factories, a radio station and a college and constructed rings of trenches and minefields.\n\nAfter Eritrean independence in 1991 the town became the provincial capital of the Sahel Province and there was investment in reconstruction and an airstrip was built. However, in 1995, with the reorganisation of administrative regions it lost that status.

Robert Beyster, was the founder of Science Applications International Corporation. He was Chairman of the Board until his retirement in July 2004, and also served as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) until November 2003. A recognized authority on national security and nuclear reactor physics, Beyster committed 35 years of his life to building SAIC on the founding tenets of employee ownership and technical excellence. In recent years, he extended this commitment to the American business community by founding two nonprofit organizations to assist organizations considering employee ownership—the Beyster Institute and the Foundation for Enterprise Development.\n\nBeyster was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1924, and grew up in Grosse Ile, Michigan. He attended school at Slocum Truax High School in Trenton, Michigan, and was salutatorian of his graduating class. As he was preparing to graduate from high school, the United States entered World War II, and he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He was sent to college at the University of Michigan, where he was enrolled in the V12 Officer Training Program. He was commissioned as an ensign, and eventually served on a destroyer based in Norfolk, Virginia before leaving the service six months later. Educated at the University of Michigan (COE: BSE, MS, PhD), Beyster worked as a scientist for Westinghouse Atomic Power Division on the company's nuclear submarine program in the 1950s. He soon followed many of his college associates to New Mexico to work as a research physicist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. In 1957 he became the chairman of the Accelerator Physics Department of General Atomics where he remained until it was bought by Gulf Oil in 1968.\n\nIn 1969, Beyster raised money to start Science Applications, Inc. (SAI) by investing the proceeds from selling stock he had received from General Atomic, combined with funds raised from the early employees who bought stock in the young enterprise. The company was renamed Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) as it expanded its operations. Initially the company's focus was on projects for the U.S. government related to nuclear power and weapons effects study programs. Contrary to traditional business models, Beyster designed SAIC so that ownership of the company and profits belonged to the company's employees. This shared ownership was accompanied by shared responsibility and freedom in business development. SAIC attracted and retained highly educated (most with PhDs or master's degrees) and motivated entrepreneurs that helped the company to grow and diversify. Today, SAIC, now named Leidos, performs projects for commercial and government customers related to information technology, systems integration and eSolutions, national and homeland security, energy, the environment, space, telecommunications, health care, and logistics. When Beyster retired as Chairman of SAIC on July 16, 2004, the company had annual revenues of $6.7 billion and more than 43,000 employees.\n\nBeyster founded the Foundation for Enterprise Development in 1986 \"to help develop successful enterprises in the U.S. and around the world\" by focusing on \"advancing entrepreneurship and employee ownership through its work with technologists, entrepreneurs, executives, governments, and educators.\" In 2004, the Foundation launched the Beyster Institute, which is \"dedicated to training, education, and consulting in employee ownership and entrepreneurship.\"\n\nBeyster wrote or co-authored approximately 60 publications and reports, as well as the books, The SAIC Solution: How We Built an $8 Billion Employee-Owned Technology Company, published by John Wiley & Sons in 2007 and Names, Numbers, and Network Solutions: The Monetization of the Internet, cowritten with Michael A. Daniels and published in 2013. A fellow of the American Nuclear Society, Beyster has served as Chairman of its Reactor Physics Division and Shielding Division.

It is 4 miles (6 km) north of Liskeard, and ¾ mile (1.25 km) south-east of Minions, the highest village in Cornwall (). Built in 1961, the station includes a guyed steel lattice mast. The mean height for the television antennas is above sea level. The site has a smaller towers used for telecommunications and a wireless internet signal. It is owned and operated by Arqiva.\n\nThe South Caradon Copper Mine, 1,000 yards (1 km) to the SW of the transmitter, was the largest copper mine in the UK in its heyday, 150 years ago. Many other copper, tin and granite mines are scattered around the base of the hill.\n\nThe station was built in 1961 by the Independent Television Authority to bring ITV to South West England for the first time. Inaugural broadcasts were from the ITV franchise holder for the area, Westward Television. 405-line monochrome transmissions were on channel 12, Band III VHF. The station was also the first in the area to broadcast television using Band III.\n\nIn 1969 it was chosen to become a main station in the new colour UHF television network, broadcasting BBC1, BBC2 and Westward Television. Both the UHF and VHF services continued in tandem until 1985, when VHF television was discontinued in the UK.\n\nIn 1992 Caradon Hill (along with Redruth) was chosen as the site of the first commercial radio broadcasts in Cornwall, with Pirate FM taking to the air on 11 March of that year.\n\nCaradon Hill covers east and central Cornwall, from Truro and Falmouth in the west to Plymouth and Bude in the east. It also reaches into west Devon, as far as Barnstaple, Okehampton and Salcombe.\n\nDigital switchover began at Caradon Hill in the early hours of 12 August 2009. At approximately 1.15am the analogue BBC Two signal was switched off. The other analogue signals (BBC One, ITV and Channel 4) along with digital Multiplex 1 were then temporarily switched off in sequence. Between one and two hours later the analogue BBC One, ITV and Channel 4 signals were restored in sequence along with Multiplex 1 which was moved from UHF 34 to UHF 28 – analogue BBC Two's frequency.\n\nThe rest of the analogue signals were switched off permanently just after midnight on 9 September 2009. Once the digital signals were reshuffled to take advantage of the space left by the switched off analogue signals, they were then brought up to full power (digital signals were broadcast at a much lower power pre-switchover). This completed Caradon Hill's switchover to digital. This also completed the West Country region's digital switchover.\n\nFreeview HD became available on UHF 22 on 11 June 2010. All four main HD channels – BBC HD, BBC One HD, ITV1 HD and Channel 4 HD – are available.\n\nPrior to 19 June 2019, Caradon Hill used to broadcast two additional multiplexes. This is due to the clearance of the 700MHz frequency band. \nAnalogue television is no longer transmitted from Caradon Hill. BBC Two was closed on 12 August 2009 and the remaining three services on 9 September.\n\n\n"}

The plot is based on the novel of the same title written by \"Chimo\" (a pseudonym).\n\nChimo (played by Mohammed Khouas) is a nineteen-year-old self-described loser who lives in an Arab ghetto with his mother in post-9/11 Marseille. Unemployed, he turns down an opportunity to study (free of charge) at a writers' school for teenagers in Paris despite showing real promise as a writer. Instead, he wastes his day hanging around with other unemployed and aimless \"losers\". He falls for Lila (Vahina Giocante), a beautiful blonde sixteen-year-old who just moved into the neighborhood with her eccentric and sexually abusive aunt. Lila is a self-styled \"bad girl\" who presents an overtly sexual persona; they begin a tentative romance after Lila invites him to look up her skirt while she rides a swing.\n\nMeanwhile, Mouloud (Karim Ben Haddou), Chimo's best friend and leader of their band of friends, also sets his sights on Lila. He begins to sexually harass Lila, not allowing her to walk the streets of the neighborhood unmolested. Chimo's disgust at Mouloud's behaviour towards Lila creates a huge rift between them. Mouloud, resentful of Chimo's changing attitude toward him and Lila's sexual indifference, vents his aggressions by attacking Lila and her aunt at home and raping Lila. Chimo is broken when he discovers Lila was in fact still a virgin, despite her stories of outrageous sexual adventures. This is confirmed by finding her scrapbook showing the sources of the titillating, but fictional, stories she told him. Lila is taken away by her aunt, leaving Chimo heartbroken. He eventually manages to convince a police detective to let him telephone Lila, whereupon he simply says \"I love you\" and she says \"I know\". It is implied at the end that he plans to meet Lila who is in Poland for the summer. However, as he remembers his experiences with Lila, he writes about them, winning the writing scholarship he scorned earlier, and ultimately changing his life and allowing him to escape the poverty of his home city and to study among the best in Paris. Lila changed Chimo's world, as he did hers.\n\n\"Lila says\" received mainly positive reaction and reviews: As of April 18, 2008 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes 69% of critics gave the movie positive reviews. On IMDb the movie holds an average of 7/10 based on 3309 votes.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1991 by Dan Brumleve, Nasri Hajj, and Santiago Zorzopulos in Urbana, Illinois. It requires its players to focus on role-playing.\n\n\"Armageddon\"s setting began with a heavy influence from \"Dark Sun\", \"Dune\", and other fantasy and science fiction sources, such as \"The Morgaine Stories\" by C. J. Cherryh, and Robert Asprin's \"Thieves' World\", but has since grown and evolved. While some of these elements are still part of the campaign, ongoing development is not focused on maintaining a commitment to those influences.\n\nThe game world has two city-states called Allanak and Tuluk. The city populaces comprise commoners trying to live from day to day, nobles working to rise in power, and templars, civic officials who enforce the will of the cities' Sorcerer-Kings.\n\nAllanak is the setting's original city-state, and is a class-based society with a long and decadent history. It once ruled the known world, but has since retreated back to its own borders. Allanak's expansion was orchestrated by the game's players, as was the subsequent loss of these territories. For many within Allanak, this collapse went unnoticed amid a self-absorbed orgy of violence and pleasure. Public displays of torture, violent and bloody arena matches, and tremendous indulgences of depravity are typical of Allanak, with the templars exercising power with near impunity.\n\nThe other city-state of Tuluk is a young, energetic caste-based society. Player-influenced events led to the people of Tuluk throwing off the yoke of Allanak's oppression, bringing a sense of growth, expansion, and opportunity that makes Tuluk a center of political maneuvering. Tuluk is ruled with silent oppression, with people who break the law simply disappearing, fostering a secretive and distrustful atmosphere.\n\nDuring the occupation of Tuluk, the nobles survived by relying on the common caste to hide them. This developed a closeness between castes that survives to the present, with the nobility and the common caste often operating closely together, though social boundaries such as a taboo against sexual contact between the castes remain.\n\nSmaller outposts and safe havens exist in Zalanthas, generally struggling to remain independent from the city-states. These communities provide sanctuary from the dangers of the wastes and from the deadly politics and tyranny of Allanak and Tuluk, but typically have harsh and unforgiving local law enforcement. Nomadic tribes have a precarious existence in the wastes, working to survive while fending off beasts, raiders and magickers.\n\nMagickers, those who use arcane powers, are seen with dread, hatred and loathing. Tuluk bans them, while Allanak subjugates their elementalists with gemmed collars; sorcerers are killed mercilessly by either city-state. To survive, magickers must master their respective elements, or in the case of sorcerers, their inherently tremendous well of power. The magick system in \"Armageddon\" is robust and extensive, featuring eight distinct magick classes, seven based on elementalism and the eighth on sorcery. Each class employs its respective competency through numerous spells. However, as the setting is low fantasy, the intention is that it should be rare to encounter magickers.\n\n\"Armageddon\" includes the mul race of human-dwarf crossbreeds found in the \"Dark Sun\" setting. They are primarily bred by noble houses as gladiatorial slaves for the arenas of Allanak and Tuluk. Roleplaying guidelines from \"Armageddon\" suggest that muls, being sterile, often suffer from a sense of meaninglessness.\n\nIn a departure from genre convention, there are no levels to be gained in \"Armageddon\"; a player character's fighting prowess, like his ability at woodcrafting or bartering, is measured by skills which rise through use, with no explicit statistical measurement provided to the player. \"Perma-death\" is another major game element; when a player character dies in \"Armageddon\", it is a one-time, permanent matter. These factors are intended to help players focus on roleplaying realistically through giving them a true fear of death and a greater concern for their character's interaction with the world than with a numerical skill percentage.\n\nPlayers are allowed only one character at a time, with each successive one being tied to a single player account. The account then becomes a sort of personal record, storing staff comments about the player as well as a general measurement of trust called \"karma\". Karma allows a player to create a character using restricted classes and races, such as magickers and muls.\n\nPlayers are expected to provide a detailed description for their characters. In a departure from how, in many aspects, \"Armageddon\" works to have the game heavily model characters and their interactions rather than relying on human interpretation, descriptions are \"flat\" text and \"their effects are not regulated algorithmically\".\n\n\"Armageddon\" is unusual in having codice_1 and codice_2 commands, which allow one to silently express the thoughts and feelings of their characters without broadcasting them to everyone in the room.\n\nAs a result of internal controversy, the MUD has developed player conduct rules regarding cybersex that require prior consent for anyone to roleplay sexual interaction with another player character.\n\n\"Armageddon\" is based on DikuMUD, and is written mainly in C, with elements of JavaScript. It is unusual in being based on a DikuMUD infrastructure rather than one of the MU* systems more typically used for roleplaying-focused MUDs.\n\nIn 2006, a major overhaul to \"Armageddon\" called \"Armageddon Reborn\" was announced. On May 15, 2012 the project was officially cancelled.\n\n\"Armageddon\" has been praised as a \"complex and professional\" MUD that facilitates \"high caliber role playing\".\n\nA separate discussion board centered on discussion without Armageddon's rules controlling the content posted regarding the MUD was founded in early 2013. It has since attracted over 800 members, including several prominent former players and former staff members, including a former Producer of the game, who represented the highest level of the game's staff.\n\nIn 1994, \"Armageddon\" was found to be one of the top 20 destinations for telnet sessions at National Capital Freenet.\n\nThe MUD's staff take pride in having a mission statement that describes administrators' accountability and priorities, which include stability, game balance, consistency, and a \"Gee-Whiz Factor\".\n\nA major contributor to, and evangelist for, \"Armageddon\" has been science fiction and fantasy writer Cat \"Sanvean\" Rambo.\n"}

A music video for the song, directed by Nigel Dick, was released in 1996.. The single was not released in the UK.\n\nThe song was released in the U.S. as a radio single to great success, becoming the band's second No. 1 single on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It also peaked at No. 20 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Airplay, becoming the band's third top 40 single on that chart. The song is included on the band's greatest hits album \"Stop the Clocks\" and on the U.S. release of \"Time Flies... 1994–2009\".

Noel Gallagher has stated, \"I think it's the only song, since it was written, that we've played every night.\" During the Morning Glory Tour in 1995/96 and the Be Here Now Tour in 1997/98, the song's ending was usually stretched out by five or so minutes, with Noel playing a long improvised guitar solo. An example of one of these performances can be seen on the DVD \"...There and Then\".\n\nOasis performed the song at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, with lead vocalist Liam Gallagher making rude gestures at his brother Noel as he was playing his guitar solo and then spitting beer all over the stage before storming off. At Oasis' Knebworth performance, Stone Roses guitarist John Squire made a guest appearance.\n\nAfter Noel's abrupt departure from Oasis in August 2009 and the band's subsequent dissolution, \"Champagne Supernova\" became the last original song they performed live together; the very last song was a cover of \"I Am the Walrus\" by the Beatles, as was the case with most of their concerts.\n\nSince Oasis' split, the song has been performed by Noel's follow-up band Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, Liam's follow-up band Beady Eye, and Liam during his solo career.\n\nBrendan Lynch was hired to produce an alternate mix and a remix. The alternate mix was eventually released on the Deluxe Edition of \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" while the remix was issued on the B-side on a promo-only 12\" of Oasis' cover of Slade's \"Cum On Feel the Noize\". Known as the \"Lynchmob Beats Mix\", this remix has been reissued on promotional material for the band's greatest hits album \"Stop the Clocks\".\n\nLive versions of the track were released on \"...There and Then\" and \"Familiar to Millions\".

{"id": "2056688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056688", "title": "Chanak Crisis", "text": "Chanak Crisis\n\nThe Chanak Crisis (), also called the Chanak Affair and the Chanak Incident, was a war scare in September 1922 between the United Kingdom and Turkey. \"Chanak\" refers to Çanakkale, a city at the Anatolian side of the Dardanelles Strait. The crisis was caused by Turkish efforts to push the Greek armies out of Turkey and restore Turkish rule in the Allied occupied territories of Turkey, primarily in Constantinople (now Istanbul) and Eastern Thrace. Turkish troops marched against British and French positions in the Dardanelles neutral zone. For a time, war between Britain and Turkey seemed possible, but Canada refused to agree as did France and Italy. British public opinion did not want a war. The British military did not either, and the top general on the scene, Sir Charles Harington, refused to relay an ultimatum to the Turks because he counted on a negotiated settlement. The Conservatives in Britain's coalition government refused to follow Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George, who with Winston Churchill was calling for war.\n\nThe crisis quickly ended when Turkey, having overwhelmed the Greeks, agreed to a negotiated settlement that gave it the territory it wanted. Lloyd George's mishandling of the crisis contributed to his downfall via the Carlton Club meeting. The crisis raised the issue of who decided on war for the British Empire, and was Canada's first assertion of diplomatic independence from London. Historian Robert Blake says the Chanak incident led to Arthur Balfour's definition of Britain and the dominions as \"autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of the domestic or internal affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations\". In 1931 the UK Parliament enacted Balfour's formula into law through the Statute of Westminster 1931.\n\nThe Turkish troops had recently defeated Greek forces and recaptured İzmir (Smyrna) on 9 September and were advancing on Constantinople in the neutral zone. In an interview published on \"Daily Mail\", 15 September 1922, leader of the Turkish national movement Mustafa Kemal Atatürk stated that: \"\"Our demands remain the same after our recent victory as they were before. We ask for Asia Minor, Thrace up to the river Maritsa and Constantinople... We must have our capital and I should in that case be obliged to march on Constantinople with my army, which will be an affair of only a few days. I much prefer to obtain possession by negotiation, though naturally I cannot wait indefinitely.\"\" \nThe British Cabinet met on the same day and decided that British forces should maintain their positions. On the following day, in the absence of Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon, certain Cabinet ministers issued a communiqué threatening Turkey with a declaration of war by Britain and the Dominions, on the grounds that Turkey had violated the Treaty of Sèvres. On 18 September, on his return to London, Curzon pointed out that this would enrage the Prime Minister of France, Raymond Poincaré, and left for Paris to attempt to smooth things over. Poincaré, however, had already ordered the withdrawal of the French detachment at Chanak but persuaded the Turks to respect the neutral zone. Curzon reached Paris on 20 September and, after several angry meetings with Poincaré, reached agreement to negotiate an armistice with the Turks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Turkish population living in Constantinople were being organised for a possible offensive against the city by the Kemalist forces. For instance, Ernest Hemingway, reporting for \"The Toronto Daily Star\" at the time as a war correspondent, wrote about a specific incident:\nIn British politics, Lloyd George, Winston Churchill, and the Conservative Lord Birkenhead were pro-Greek and wanted war; all other Conservatives of the coalition in his government were pro-Turk and rejected war. Lloyd George's position as head of the coalition became untenable. Furthermore, the British public were alarmed by the Chanak episode and the possibility of going to war again. It further undercut Lloyd George that he had not fully consulted the Dominion prime ministers.\n\nUnlike 1914, when World War I broke out, Canada in particular did not automatically consider itself active in the conflict. Instead, Prime Minister Mackenzie King insisted that the Parliament of Canada should decide on the course of action the country would follow. King was offended by the telegram he received from Churchill asking for Canada to send troops to Chanak to support Britain, and sent back a telegram, which was couched in Canadian nationalist language, declaring that Canada would not automatically support Britain if it came to war with Turkey. Given that the majority of the MPs of King's Liberal Party were opposed to going to war with Turkey together with the Progressive MPs who were supporting King's minority government, it is likely that Canada would have declared neutrality if the crisis came to war. The Chanak issue badly divided Canadian public opinion with French-Canadians and Canadian nationalists in English-Canada like professor O.D. Skelton saying Canada should not issue \"blank cheques\" to Britain like that issued in 1914 and supporting King's implicit decision for neutrality. By contrast, the Conservative leader Arthur Meighen in a speech in Toronto criticized King and declared: \"When Britain's message came, then Canada should have said, 'Ready, aye ready, we stand by you.'\" By the time the issue had been debated in the House of Commons of Canada, the threat at Chanak had passed. Nonetheless, King made his point: the Canadian Parliament would decide the role that Canada would play in external affairs and could diverge from the British government. The other dominion prime ministers and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Romania gave no support.\n\nOn 23 September, the British cabinet decided to give East Thrace to the Turks, thus forcing Greeks to abandon it without a fight. This convinced Kemal to accept the opening of armistice talks and on 28 September he told the British that he had ordered his troops to avoid any incident at Chanak, nominating Mudanya as the venue for peace negotiations. The parties met there on 3 October and agreed to the terms of the Armistice of Mudanya on 11 October, two hours before British forces were due to attack.\n\nLloyd George's rashness resulted in the calling of a meeting of Conservative MPs at the Carlton Club on 19 October 1922, which passed a motion that the Conservative Party should fight the next general election as an independent party. This decision had dire ramifications for Lloyd George, as the Conservative Party made up the vast majority of the 1918–1922 post-war coalition. Indeed, they could have made up the majority government if it were not for the coalition.\n\nLloyd George also lost the support of the influential Curzon, who considered that the Prime Minister had been manoeuvring behind his back. Following the Carlton Club decision, the MPs voted 185 to 85 for ending the Coalition. Lloyd George resigned as Prime Minister, never to return to cabinet level politics. The Conservatives, under returned party leader Bonar Law, subsequently won the general election with an overall majority.\n\nBritish and French forces were ultimately withdrawn from the neutral zone in summer 1923, following the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne.\n\nThe Chanak crisis fundamentally challenged the assumption that the Dominions would automatically follow Britain into war. The crisis changed the relations between the Dominions and London, paving the way for the 1931 Statute of Westminster, which explicitly declared that the Dominions had the power to declare war.\n\n"}

To its west lies the Gulf of Zula, also known as Annesley Bay, with the village of Arafali at its head. To the north of the peninsular is the Massawa Channel and a group of islands, the Dahlak Archipelago, the largest and closest to the mainland being Dahlak Kebir. To the east of the peninsula lies Howakil Bay, a broad bay, scattered with islands, the largest of which is Howakil Island, and to the south lies a ridge of low hills. The peninsula is generally low and undulating, composed of larva flows at the southern end and granite at the north. It is about long and wide, with a constriction wide in the middle. Further inland to the south are volcanic hills, some conical and others located on ridges, with small sandy plains between them. The highest mountains on the peninsula is Mount Abdur near the west coast and Mount Dureli near the tip. There is a large salt-water lagoon near the middle. Much of the coast is fringed with reefs.\n\nThe western side of the peninsula is sandy with low hills in places. After the fishing village of Irafale, is a broad bay with black volcanic sand. The road crosses the peninsula beyond this point before continuing eastwards to Ghela'elo, the capital of the Ghela'elo Subregion.\n\nVaried in geography, it features mangroves and salt pans. It is known for its wildlife, including ostriches, hamadryas baboons and wild asses. Stone tools were discovered within uplifted marine terraces near the small village of Abdur on the east coast of the peninsula.\n"}

The song \"Ruby, My Dear\" is performed only by Monk, Coleman Hawkins, Wilbur Ware, and Art Blakey. John Coltrane had joined Monk after playing with the Miles Davis Quintet, and Monk can be heard enthusiastically calling on him (\"Coltrane!

The stereo version was released a year after the mono, in 1959. It has been noted that the mixes of these releases are extremely different. The stereo mix, while featuring the same performances as does the mono version, used an entirely different set of microphones, suspended from the ceiling, while the mono release used microphones in closer proximity to the instruments. As a result, the stereo mix has a more distant sound and Wilbur Ware's bass is much less audible. \n\nProducer Orrin Keepnews explained:\nIn the notes to the 1986 Riverside Monk box, Keepnews wrote:\nThe original stereo LP release did not list \"Crepuscule with Nellie\" on its label or cover track listing (although it was referenced in the liner notes), and did not include it on the album, though the mono version always included the piece. A circa-1965 stereo re-release with serial number RLP 12-9242 also skipped \"Crepuscule with Nellie\", even though it was listed on the label and cover. The 1967 \"stereo\" pressing (RS 3004) distributed by ABC Records was an \"electronically reprocessed\" version of the mono mix.

{"id": "2056705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056705", "title": "History of the Conservative Party (UK)", "text": "History of the Conservative Party (UK)\n\nThe Conservative Party (also known as Tories) is the oldest political party in the United Kingdom and arguably the world. The current party was first organised in the 1830s and the name \"Conservative\" was officially adopted, but the party is still often referred to as the Tory party (not least because newspaper editors find it a convenient shorthand when space is limited). The Tories had been a coalition that more often than not formed the government from 1760 until the Reform Act 1832. Modernising reformers said the traditionalistic party of \"Throne, Altar and Cottage\" was obsolete, but in the face of an expanding electorate 1830s–1860s it held its strength among royalists, devout Anglicans and landlords and their tenants.\n\nWidening of the franchise in the 19th century led the party to popularise its approach, especially under Benjamin Disraeli, whose Reform Act of 1867 greatly increased the electorate. After 1886, the Conservatives allied with the part of the Liberal Party known as the Liberal Unionists who opposed their party's support for Irish Home Rule and together they held office for all but three of the following twenty years. Lord Salisbury's and Arthur Balfour's governments between 1895 and 1906 were given the name of \"Unionist\". The Conservative Party was also known as the Unionist Party in the early 20th century. In 1909, the Conservative Party was renamed the Conservative and Unionist Party and in May 1912 it formally merged with the Liberal Unionists.\n\nThe First World War saw the formation of an all-party coalition government and for four years after the armistice the Unionist Party remained in coalition with the Lloyd George Liberals. Eventually, grassroots pressure forced the breakup of the coalition and the party regained power on its own, but after the separation of the Irish Free State in 1922 it increasingly used the name \"Conservative\" more than \"Unionist\". It again dominated the political scene in the inter-war period from 1931 in a National Government as the main rivals the Liberals and Labour virtually collapsed. The party pursued protective tariffs and low taxes during the depression years of the 1930s. In foreign policy, it favoured peace and appeasement of Italy and Germany until 1939. In the late 1930s, it supported a hurried rearmament program to catch up with Germany. The crisis came in 1940 as Germany defeated France and Britain and its Commonwealth stood alone against Adolf Hitler. The result was a wartime all-party coalition government with partisanship in abeyance. In the 1945 general election, the party lost power in a landslide by the Labour Party.\n\nThe Conservatives largely accepted the reality of the Labour government's nationalisation programme, the creation of the welfare state and the taxes required for it. However, when they returned to power in 1951 the party oversaw an economic boom and ever-increasing national prosperity throughout the 1950s. The party stumbled in the 1960s and 1970s, but in 1975 Margaret Thatcher became leader and converted it to a monetarist economic programme; after her election victory in 1979 her government became known for its free market approach to problems and privatisation of public utilities. Here, the Conservatives experienced a high-point, with Thatcher leading the Conservatives to two more landslide election victories in 1983 and 1987.\n\nHowever, towards the end of the 1980s Thatcher's increasing unpopularity within the parliamentary party and unwillingness to change policies perceived as vote-losing led to her being deposed in 1990 and replaced by John Major, who won an unexpected election victory in 1992. Major's government suffered a political blow when the Pound Sterling was forced out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism later that year, which lost the party much of its reputation for good financial stewardship. Although the country's economy recovered in the mid-1990s, an effective opposition campaign by the Labour Party led to a landslide defeat in 1997. The party returned to government in a coalition under David Cameron following the 2010 general election. In the 2015 general election, the Conservatives managed to win a majority and saw Cameron return to power for a second term. The 2017 general election saw the Conservatives lose their majority and form a confidence and supply agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party. Under the leadership of Boris Johnson, the Conservatives were able to regain their majority during the 2019 general election, their largest ever since the Thatcher years.\n\nThe modern Conservative Party arose in the 1830s, emerging from the Tory party that had formed about 1812, a key moment of the transition coming with the Tamworth Manifesto of 1834. Political alignments in those centuries were much looser than now, with many individual groupings. From the 1780s until the 1820s the dominant grouping was those Whigs following William Pitt the Younger. From about 1812 on the name \"Tory\" was commonly used for a new party called by the historian Robert Blake \"the ancestors of 'Conservatism.'\". Blake adds that Pitt's successors after 1812 \"Were not in any sense standard-bearers of 'true Toryism.'\" Pitt never used the term 'Tory'. In the late 1820s, disputes over political reform, especially Roman Catholic Emancipation, broke up this grouping. A government led by the Duke of Wellington collapsed in 1831 amidst a Whig landslide. Now in the minority, Robert Peel set about assembling a new coalition of forces. Peel issued the Tamworth Manifesto in 1834 which set out the basic principles of Conservatism, and that year he formed a short-lived government. On the fall of Lord Melbourne's government after a Whig electoral defeat in 1841 Peel took office with a substantial majority and appeared set for a long rule.\n\nIn 1846 disaster struck the Conservatives when the party split over the repeal of the Corn Laws. Peel and most senior Conservatives favoured repeal, but they were opposed by backbench members representing farming and rural constituencies, led by Lord George Bentinck, Benjamin Disraeli, and Lord Stanley (later the Earl of Derby), who favoured protectionism. Following repeal, the Protectionists combined with the Whigs to overthrow Peel's government. It would be twenty-eight years before a Conservative Prime Minister again had a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nFrom this point on, and especially after the death of Peel in 1850, the Peelites and Conservatives drifted apart. Most of the Peelites joined with the Whigs and Radicals to form the Liberal Party in 1859, under the leadership of Lord Palmerston.\n\nThe Conservatives survived as an independent party, even though they would not form another majority government until the 1870s. The modern Conservative Party descends from the Protectionists who broke with Peel in 1846, although they did not reintroduce Protection when they were returned to power. Under the leadership of Derby and Disraeli they consolidated their position and slowly rebuilt the strength of the party. Although Derby led several minority governments in the 1850s and 1860s, the party could not achieve a majority until 1874, after the passage of the Reform Act of 1867, which broadened the franchise. Disraeli's mixed message of patriotism and promises of social reforms managed to win him enough working-class support to win a majority in 1874, but the Conservative hold remained tenuous, and Disraeli was defeated in the election of 1880. It was not until the split in the Liberal Party over Irish home rule in 1886 that the Conservatives were able to achieve truly secure majorities through the defection of the Liberal Unionists. In 1891, the Irish Conservative Party, which had experienced considerable electoral loses over the previous two decades, joined with other Irish unionist movements to form the Irish Unionist Alliance (IUA). The IUA's MPs took the Conservative whip at Westminster.\n\nDisraeli provided a widely popular hero for Conservatives, and was much celebrated in the popular culture in support of imperialism for decades after his death. British music hall patrons in the 1880s and 1890s applauded the xenophobia and pride in empire that were exemplified by the halls' most popular political heroes: all were Conservatives and Disraeli stood out above all, while Gladstone was used as a villain. By the 1920s historical films helped maintain the political status quo by imposing an establishment viewpoint that emphasised the greatness of monarchy, empire, and tradition. The films created \"a facsimile world where existing values were invariably validated by events in the film and where all discord could be turned into harmony by an acceptance of the status quo.\" Disraeli was an especially popular film hero: \"historical dramas favoured Disraeli over Gladstone and, more substantively, promulgated an essentially deferential view of democratic leadership.\" Stage and screen actor George Arliss was known for his portrayals of Disraeli, winning the Oscar as best actor for 1929's \"Disraeli\". Steven Fielding says Arliss \"personified the kind of paternalistic, kindly, homely statesmanship that appealed to a significant proportion of the cinema audience...Even workers attending Labour party meetings deferred to leaders with an elevated social background who showed they cared.\".\n\nThe Conservatives, now led by Lord Salisbury, remained in power for most of the next twenty years, at first passively supported by the Liberal Unionists and then, after 1895, in active coalition with them. From 1895, unofficially, and after 1912 officially, the Conservative-Liberal Unionist coalition was often simply called the \"Unionists\". In 1902 Salisbury retired, and his nephew Arthur Balfour became Prime Minister.\n\nThe party then split on the issue of Tariff Reform. The controversy had been taken up by the Liberal Unionist cabinet minister Joseph Chamberlain, who was Colonial Secretary. Like the earlier schism over the Corn Laws in 1846, the result led to polarisation within the coalition between those who supported Chamberlain and Imperial Preference, and those who opposed him in defence of the \"status quo\" and Free Trade. The split went across both Unionist parties. With the beleaguered Balfour in the middle, the government struggled on for another two years and saw many Unionist MPs defect to the Liberals. These defectors included the future Conservative party leader Winston Churchill in 1904.\n\nThe Conservatives—usually called \"Unionists\"—were dominant from the 1890s to 1906. The party had many strengths, appealing to voters supportive of imperialism, tariffs, the Church of England, a powerful Royal Navy, and traditional hierarchical society. There was a powerful leadership base in the landed aristocracy and landed gentry in rural England, plus strong support from the Church of England and military interests. Historians have used election returns to demonstrate that Conservatives did surprisingly well in working-class districts. They had an appeal as well to the better-off element of traditional working class Britons in the larger cities. In rural areas, the national headquarters made highly effective use of paid travelling lecturers, with pamphlets, posters, and especially lantern slides, who were able to communicate effectively with rural voters - particularly the newly enfranchised agricultural workers. In the first years of the 20th century, the Conservative government, with Arthur Balfour as Prime Minister 1902–1905, had numerous successes in foreign policy, defence, and education, and enacted solutions for the high-profile issues of alcohol licensing and land ownership for the peasants of Ireland.\n\nNevertheless, the weaknesses were accumulating, and proved so overwhelming in 1906 that they did not return to complete power until 1922. The Conservative Party was losing its drive and enthusiasm, especially after the retirement of the charismatic Joseph Chamberlain. There was a bitter split on \"tariff reform\" (that is, imposing tariffs or taxes on all imports), that drove many of the free traders over to the Liberal camp. Tariff reform was a losing issue that the Conservative leadership inexplicably clung to. Support among the top tier of the working class, and in lower middle class weakened, and there was dissatisfaction among the intellectuals. The 1906 election was a landslide for the opposition, which saw its total vote jump 25 percent, while the Conservative total vote held steady.\n\nThe election of 1906 ended in a landslide defeat for the Unionists and their numbers were reduced to just 157 members of the House of Commons. The Unionists had been suffering as a result of the unpopular Boer War, as well as the unpopular tariff reforms proposed by Chamberlain, which faced the popularity of free trade among the urban population. Chamberlain himself was told to keep his \"hands off the people's food!\" Balfour lost his own seat, although he soon returned to Parliament in a by-election. The severe stroke suffered by Joseph Chamberlain in July 1906 ended his career; the cause of Tariff reform would now be promoted by his son Austen Chamberlain.\n\nIn 1909 the Conservative Party was renamed the \"Conservative and Unionist Party\", and in May 1912 it formally merged with the Liberal Unionists.\n\nThe Unionists strongly opposed many of the proposed reforms of the new Liberal government of Campbell-Bannerman and that of Asquith which followed. In 1910, the Unionist-dominated House of Lords rejected the so-called \"People's Budget\", leading to a long conflict over the nature and constitutional place of the House of Lords. The Conservatives managed to make up much of their losses in both the January and December elections of 1910. This forced the Liberals to rely on Irish Nationalist votes to maintain their majority. Although the Liberals were able to force through the effective subjugation of the Lords with the Parliament Act 1911, their advocacy once again cost them support, so that by 1914 a Unionist victory in the next election looked possible. Under Bonar Law's leadership in 1911–14, the Party's morale improved, the \"radical right\" wing was contained, and the party machinery strengthened. It made some progress toward developing constructive social policies.\n\nThe removal of the House of Lords veto also allowed the Government to pass the Irish Home Rule Act 1914 after which the Ulster Unionist leader Edward Carson threatened civil war. He was backed up by the newly formed Ulster Volunteers and smuggled German arms. Bonar Law was pushing hard—certainly blustering and threatening, and perhaps bluffing—but in the end his strategy proved both coherent and effective as he stopped Home Rule and enabled the formation of Northern Ireland. However the First World War meant the act was suspended; it never took effect and by 1921 Ireland was partitioned, with Northern Island remaining part of the United Kingdom; it became a conservative stronghold.\n\nThe Conservatives served with the Liberals in an all-party coalition government during the First World War, and the coalition continued under Liberal PM David Lloyd George (with half of the Liberals) until 1922. Nigel Keohane finds that the Conservatives were bitterly divided before 1914, especially on the issue of Irish Unionism and the experience of three consecutive election losses. However the war pulled the party together, allowing it to emphasise patriotism as it found new leadership and worked out its positions on the Irish question, socialism, woman suffrage, electoral reform, and the issue of intervention in the economy. They became the dominant partner in Lloyd George's coalition government following their landslide in the 1918 \"coupon\" election. Patriotism appealed to its base in rural England. The fresh emphasis on anti-Socialism was its response to the growing strength of the Labour Party as the Liberals faded. The Coalition enfranchised some women with the Representation of the People Act 1918, the Conservatives enfranchised them all with the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 and aggressively sought their votes, often relying on patriotic themes.\n\nFor the next few years it seemed possible that the Liberals who supported Lloyd George and the Conservatives would merge into a new political grouping. However the reluctance of these Liberals to lose their identity ended this ambition and the moment was lost. From then on the rumblings of discontent within the coalition over issues such as the Soviet Union, trade unions and the Irish issue (leading to the \"de facto\" independence for the Irish Free State in 1921) led to many Conservatives hoping to break with Lloyd George. Bonar Law resigned in 1921 on the grounds of ill health and the parliamentary party was now led by Austen Chamberlain. Previously a contender for party leadership in 1911, Chamberlain was to prove ineffective in controlling his party—even passing up the offer of becoming Prime Minister when Lloyd George indicated he was willing to step down. The party eventually broke with Lloyd George in October 1922 as the result of the Carlton Club meeting. They voted against remaining in the coalition and Chamberlain resigned. He was replaced by Bonar Law, who had been persuaded by friends and allies to return to lead the party. The Irish Unionist Alliance collapsed in 1922, and the conservative movement in Northern Ireland was taken up by its successor there, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). The UUP MPs would take the Conservative whip at Westminster until 1972.\n\nAfter winning the election of 1922, Bonar Law, terminally ill, resigned in May 1923. Though holding a majority in government, the Tories were still split, as many of those who stayed to the bitter end of the former coalition had refused to take office in Law's cabinet. Their absence explains why the hitherto unknown Stanley Baldwin was to become leader of the party barely two years after first entering a major ministerial post. Baldwin called an election in 1923 on the issue of tariffs but lost his majority; Ramsay MacDonald formed a minority Labour government. Baldwin was back after winning the 1924 election. His second government brought in Austen Chamberlain as Foreign Secretary, Winston Churchill at the Exchequer, and Neville Chamberlain at the health ministry. Baldwin adroitly handled the General Strike in 1926 and passed the 1927 Trades Disputes Act to curb the powers of trade unions. Baldwin lost the 1929 General Election and his continued leadership was subject to sharp criticism by the press barons Rothermere and Beaverbrook.\n\nThe party reached a new height in the inter-war years under Baldwin's leadership. His mixture of strong social reforms and steady government proved a powerful election combination, with the result that the Conservatives governed Britain either by themselves or as the leading component of the National Government for most of the interwar years and all through the Second World War. The Conservatives under Baldwin were also the last political party in Britain to gain over half of the vote, which they did in the general election of 1931. Yet as the war ended in victory the public demanded fresh leadership. The Conservatives were soundly defeated in the 1945 General Election by a resurgent Labour Party.\n\nThe party responded to its defeat of 1945 by accepting many of the Attlee government's welfare state reforms, while offering a distinctive Conservative edge, as set out in their policy statement \"Industrial Charter\" (1947). Until the 1970s the two parties largely agreed on foreign policy, with both supporting NATO (1949–present) and the Anglo-American alliance of the Cold War (1947–1989). Economic recovery was slow, however, and that provided the opening for a comeback.\n\nIn the late 1940s, the Conservative Party incited growing public anger against food rationing, scarcity, controls, austerity, and omnipresent government bureaucracy. It used the dissatisfaction with the socialistic and egalitarian policies of the Labour Party to rally middle-class supporters and to build a political comeback that won the 1951 general election. Their appeal was especially effective to housewives, who faced even more difficult shopping conditions after the war than during it.\n\nThe success of the Conservative Party in reorganising itself was validated by its victory in the 1951 election. It had restored its credibility on economic policy with the Industrial Charter written by Rab Butler, which emphasised the importance of removing unnecessary controls, while going far beyond the laissez-faire attitude of old toward industrial social problems. Churchill was party leader, but he brought in a Party Chairman to modernise the creaking institution. Lord Woolton was a successful department store owner and wartime Minister of Food. As Party Chairman 1946–55, he rebuilt the local organisations with an emphasis on membership, money, and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues. To broaden the base of potential candidates, the national party provided financial aid to candidates, and assisted the local organisations in raising local money. Lord Woolton emphasised a rhetoric that characterised the opponents as \"Socialist\" rather than \"Labour.\" The libertarian influence of Professor Friedrich Hayek's 1944 best-seller \"Road to Serfdom\" was apparent in the younger generation, but that took another quarter century to have a policy impact. By 1951, Labour had worn out its welcome in the middle classes; its factions were bitterly embroiled. Conservatives were ready to govern again.\n\nWith a narrow win in the 1951 general election, Churchill was back. Although he was aging rapidly, he had national and global prestige. Apart from rationing, which was ended, most of the welfare state enacted by Labour were accepted by the Conservatives and became part of the \"post war consensus\", which lasted until the 1970s. The Conservatives were conciliatory toward unions, but they did de-nationalise the steel and road haulage industries in 1953.\n\nIn 1955 Churchill retired and was succeeded by Sir Anthony Eden. Eden had an immense personal popularity and lengthy experience as Foreign Secretary, and saw the Conservatives win the general election with an increased majority later that year, but his government then ran into a number of troubles on the domestic front as the economy began to overheat.\n\nIn international affairs the spectacular fiasco of the Suez Crisis of 1956 ended Eden's career, but it had little negative impact on the party. The succession was contentious, with Rab Butler as the favourite to succeed. However, it was Harold Macmillan who became the next Prime Minister and leader of the party. Macmillan sought to rebuild the government's image both at home and abroad, and presided over strong economic growth and a massive expansion in the consumer-product economy. In 1959 he won the general election of that year on this economic success, summed up in the slogan \"You've never had it so good\". The Conservatives had now won three general elections in succession and once again they had increased their majority. Such was the scale of their success that there was widespread public and media doubt as to whether the Labour Party was capable of winning a general election ever again.\n\nHowever, rising unemployment and an economic downturn in the early 1960s eroded support for Macmillan's government. It was further rocked in 1963 by the resignation of the Secretary of State for War John Profumo over the Profumo affair. In October of that year, Macmillan was misdiagnosed with terminal cancer and resigned.\n\nThe party at this time lacked a formal process for electing a new leader and Macmillan's resignation took place in the week of the annual Conservative Party Conference. This event rapidly became an American-style convention as leading ministers sought to establish their credentials. Eventually Macmillan formally recommended to the Queen that she appoint the Earl of Home as Prime Minister. Home was appointed and renounced his peerage, becoming Sir Alec Douglas-Home, but was unable to restore the party's fortunes and narrowly lost the 1964 general election to Harold Wilson's Labour, who ended 13 years of Conservative rule.\n\nFollowing the 1964 defeat, the party formally installed a system for electing the leader. Douglas-Home stepped down in 1965 and the election to succeed him was won by Edward Heath over both Reginald Maudling and Enoch Powell. The party proceeded to lose the 1966 general election. Heath's leadership proved controversial, with frequent calls from many prominent party members and supporters for him to step down, but he persevered. To the shock of almost everyone bar Heath, the party won the 1970 general election.\n\nAs with all British governments in this period, Heath's time in office was difficult. Furthermore, the Heath premiership remains one of the most controversial in the history of the party. Initial attempts to follow monetarist policies (later considered \"Thatcherite\") failed, with high inflation and unemployment blocking Heath's attempts at reforming the increasingly militant trade unions. The era of 1970s British industrial unrest had arrived.\n\nThe Troubles in Northern Ireland would lead Heath to suspending the Parliament of Northern Ireland and introducing direct rule as a precursor to establishing a power-sharing executive under the Sunningdale Agreement. This resulted in the Conservative Party losing the support of the Ulster Unionist Party at Westminster, which was to have consequences in later years when the party found itself reliant on tiny Commons majorities. Heath himself considered his greatest success in office to be the United Kingdom's entry into the European Economic Community (or the \"Common Market\" as it was widely called at the time) but in subsequent years the UK's membership of the EEC was to prove the source of the greatest division in the party.\n\nThe country suffered a further bout of inflation in 1973 as a result of the OPEC cartel raising oil prices, and this in turn led to renewed demands for wage increases in the coal industry. The government refused to accede to the miner's demands, resulting in a series of stoppages and massive attempts to ration power, including the \"Three Day Week\". Heath decided to call a snap election on the question of \"Who Governs Britain?\". However the Conservative Party was unprepared, whilst the miners' unions stated that they did not see how the re-election of the government would change the situation. The Conservatives were further rocked by the death of Iain Macleod and the resignation of Enoch Powell, who denounced the government for taking the country into the EEC and called on voters to back the Labour Party, who had promised a referendum on withdrawal. The February 1974 election produced an unusual result as support for the Liberals, Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru all surged, Northern Ireland's politics became more localised, whilst the Conservatives won a plurality of votes but Labour had a plurality of seats. With a hung Parliament elected and the Ulster Unionists refusing to support the Conservative party, Heath tried to negotiate with the Liberals to form a coalition, but the attempts foundered on demands that were not acceptable to both parties. Heath was forced to resign as Prime Minister.\n\nThese years were seen as the height of \"consensus politics\". However, by the 1970s many traditional methods of running the economy, managing relations with trade unions, and so on began to fail—or had outright already failed. This was also a period of Labour-Party ascendancy, as they ruled for nearly twelve out of the fifteen years between 1964 and 1979. Many in the Conservative Party were left wondering how to proceed.\n\nHeath remained leader of the party despite growing challenges to his mandate, and the fact that he had now lost three of his four general elections as party leader. At the time there was no system for challenging an incumbent leader but after renewed pressure and a second general election defeat a system was put in place and Heath agreed to holding a leadership election to allow him to renew his mandate. In spite of his track record as Conservative party leader, which had included defeat at three out of four general elections, few both inside and out of the party expected him to be seriously challenged, let alone defeated. However, Margaret Thatcher stood against Heath and in a shock result outpolled him on the first ballot, leading him to withdraw from the contest. Thatcher then faced off four other candidates to become the first woman to lead a major British political party. Thatcher had much support from the monetarists, led by Keith Joseph. The Conservatives would eventually capitalise on the Winter of Discontent during late 1978 and early 1979, and even in the very early Thatcher era they were able to criticise the Labour government for rising inflation and unemployment, not to mention the humiliating bailout of the UK economy by the IMF in 1976. However, when the Labour government lost its parliamentary majority in March 1977, it survived a vote of confidence in parliament when challenged by the Conservatives, and then formed an electoral pact with the Liberal Party in order to prevent another similar threat to its power.\n\nJames Callaghan had succeeded Harold Wilson as Labour leader and prime minister in March 1976, and in September 1978 resisted calls to hold a general election, despite improving economic conditions and opinion polls which showed Labour well placed to win a parliamentary majority. However, this proved to be a disastrous miscalculation by Callaghan, which the Tories took advantage of, as the Winter of Discontent followed and the Tories were ascendant in the opinion polls. A vote of no confidence was delivered against Callaghan's government in March 1979, and the Tories won the 1979 general election with a majority of 43 seats, with Thatcher becoming Britain's first female prime minister.\n\nThatcher soon introduced controversial and difficult economic reforms in order to solve the crises which had blighted Britain for most of the 1970s. The Falklands War, the perceived hard left nature of the Labour Party, and the intervention of the centrist SDP-Liberal Alliance all contributed to her party winning the 1983 general election in a landslide, gaining a majority of 144. This was despite dismal opinion poll showings for the Conservative government until the Falklands conflict, and also in spite of the early 1980s recession and mass unemployment. Thatcher's monetarist policies had a positive effect in the battle against inflation, which dropped from 27% in 1979 to less than 10% by 1982 and down to 4% by 1983.\n\nThatcher won a third successive election in 1987, this time with a 102-seat majority. Unemployment had now fallen below 3 million for the first time since 1981, and the economy was continuing to improve.\n\nThe second and third terms were dominated by privatisations of Britain's many state-owned industries, including British Telecom in 1984, the bus companies in 1985, British Gas in 1986, British Airways in 1987, Austin Rover (formerly British Leyland), and British Steel Corporation in 1988. In 1984, Thatcher also successfully concluded five-year-long negotiations over Britain's budget to the European Economic Community. (\"See UK rebate\".)\n\nIn 1989, the Community Charge (frequently referred to as the \"poll tax\") was introduced to replace the ancient system of rates (based on property values) which funded local government. This unpopular new charge was a flat rate per adult no matter what their circumstances; it seemed to be shifting the tax burden disproportionately onto the poor. Once again Thatcher's popularity sagged, but this time the Conservatives thought it might cost them the election. Michael Heseltine, a former cabinet member, challenged her for the leadership in November 1990. She won the first round, but not enough to win outright, and having initially announced her intention to \"fight on and fight to win\" she resigned after it was clear the cabinet wouldn't back her she announced her intention to stand down. This signalled the end of her time in office on 22 November 1990 after 11 years as prime minister—a longer spell in power than any prime minister of the 20th century. In the ensuing second ballot, the Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major beat Heseltine and Douglas Hurd. Thatcher continued to sit in parliament as an MP until the 1992 general election, when she stepped down from parliament after 33 years.\n\nMajor introduced a replacement for the Community Charge, the Council Tax, and continued with the privatisations, and went on to narrowly win the 1992 election with a majority of 21.\n\nMajor's government was beset by scandals, crisis, and missteps. Many of the scandals were about the personal lives of politicians which the media construed as hypocrisy, but the Cash for Questions affair and the divisions over EU were substantive. In 1995, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party in order to trigger a leadership election which he hoped would give him a renewed mandate, and quieten the Maastricht rebels (e.g. Iain Duncan Smith, Bill Cash, Bernard Jenkin). John Redwood, then Secretary of State for Wales, stood against Major and gained around a fifth of the leadership vote. He was one of the people whom Major inadvertently referred to as 'bastards' during a television interview. Major was pleased that Michael Heseltine had not stood against him and gave him the position of Deputy Prime Minister as a result.\n\nAs the term went on, with by-elections being consistently lost by the Conservatives, their majority declined and eventually vanished entirely. Getting every vote out became increasingly important to both sides, and on several occasions ill MPs were wheeled into the Commons to vote. Eventually, the Government became a technical minority.\n\nAs predicted, the general election of May 1997 was a win for the Labour Party, but the magnitude of the victory surprised almost everyone. There was a swing of 20% in some places, and Labour achieved a majority of 179 with 43% of the vote to the Conservatives' 31%. Tactical voting against the Conservatives is believed to have caused around 40 seats to change hands. They lost all their seats outside England, with prominent members such as Michael Portillo and Malcolm Rifkind among the losses. Major resigned within 24 hours.\n\nIt is often said that the Conservatives lost the 1997 election due to EU party-policy divisions. However, it is likely that the European question played only a small or insignificant part in the result. Accusations of \"Tory sleaze\", apathy towards a government that had been in power for nearly two decades, and a rebranded \"New\" Labour Party with a dynamic and charismatic leader (Tony Blair) are all probable factors in the Conservative defeat.\n\nA number of political scandals in the 1990s (building on previous examples in the 1980s) created the impression of what is described in the British press as \"sleaze\": a perception, peaking towards the end of the Major era, that the Conservatives were associated with political corruption and hypocrisy. In particular the successful entrapment of Graham Riddick and David Tredinnick in the \"cash for questions\" scandal, the contemporaneous misconduct as a minister by Neil Hamilton (who lost a consequent libel action against \"The Guardian\"), and the convictions of former Cabinet member Jonathan Aitken and former party deputy chairman Jeffrey Archer for perjury in two separate cases leading to custodial sentences damaged the Conservatives' public reputation. Persistent unsubstantiated rumours about the activities of the party treasurer Michael Ashcroft did not help this impression.\n\nAt the same time a series of revelations about the private lives of various Conservative politicians also grabbed the headlines and both the media and the party's opponents made little attempt to clarify the distinction between financial conduct and private lives.\n\nJohn Major's \"Back to Basics\" morality campaign back-fired on him by providing an excuse for the British media to expose \"sleaze\" within the Conservative Party and, most damagingly, within the Cabinet itself. A number of ministers were then revealed to have committed sexual indiscretions, and Major was forced by media pressure to dismiss them. In September 2002 it was revealed that, prior to his promotion to the cabinet, Major had himself had a longstanding extramarital affair with a fellow MP, Edwina Currie.\n\nThe ensuing leadership election was contested by five candidates. The electorate for the contest consisted solely of the 165 Conservative MPs who had been returned to the House of Commons. The candidates were Kenneth Clarke, William Hague, John Redwood, Peter Lilley and Michael Howard, with Stephen Dorrell launching an initial bid but withdrawing before polling began, citing limited support, and backing Clarke. Clarke was the favoured candidate of the Europhile left of the party, while the three latter candidates divided right-wing support roughly equally. Hague, who had initially supported Howard, emerged second as a compromise candidate and won the final ballot after Redwood and Clarke negotiated a joint ticket which was derided as an \"Instability Pact\" by their opponents (punning on the economic Stability Pact of the European Community).\n\nAt first William Hague portrayed himself as a moderniser with a common touch. However, by the time the 2001 general election came he concentrated on Europe, asylum seekers and tax cuts whilst declaring that only the Conservative Party could \"Save the Pound\". Though a master debater who would regularly trounce Tony Blair in the Commons, his leadership tenure was beset by poor publicity and stumbles. Despite a low turnout, the election resulted in a net gain of a single seat for the Conservative Party and William Hague's resignation as party leader.\n\nThe 2001 leadership election was conducted under a new leadership electoral system designed by Hague. This resulted in five candidates competing for the job: Michael Portillo, Iain Duncan Smith, Kenneth Clarke, David Davis and Michael Ancram. The drawn-out and at times acrimonious election saw Conservative MPs select Iain Duncan Smith and Ken Clarke to be put forward for a vote by party members. As Conservative Party members are characteristically Eurosceptic, Iain Duncan Smith was elected, even though opinion polls showed that the public preferred Ken Clarke, a member of the Tory Reform Group. (\"Main article: 2001 Conservative leadership election.\")\n\nIain Duncan Smith (often known as IDS) was a strong Eurosceptic but this did not define his leadership – indeed it was during his tenure that Europe ceased to be an issue of division in the party as it united behind calls for a referendum on the proposed European Union Constitution. Duncan Smith's Shadow Cabinet contained many new and unfamiliar faces but despite predictions by some that the party would lurch to the right the team instead followed a pragmatic moderate approach to policy.\n\nOn 27 October Iain Duncan Smith began to face calls within his own party to either resign as leader or face a vote of confidence. Under the rules of the Conservative party, the backbench Conservative 1922 Committee would review the leadership, and in order for this to take place the chairman of the committee, Sir Michael Spicer must be presented with 25 letters proposing a vote.\n\nOn 28 October sufficient letters were presented to the chairman of the 1922 Committee to initiate a vote of confidence in Iain Duncan Smith. The vote came on 29 October, and IDS lost 90 to 75.\n\nDuncan Smith remained as caretaker leader until Michael Howard, MP for Folkestone and Hythe, was elected to the post of leader (as the only candidate) on 6 November 2003.\n\nHoward announced radical changes to the way the Shadow Cabinet would work. He slashed the number of members by half, with Theresa May and Tim Yeo each shadowing two government departments. Minor departments still have shadows but have been removed from the cabinet, and the post of Shadow Leader of the House of Commons was abolished. The role of party chairman was also split into two, with Lord Saatchi responsible for the party machine, and Liam Fox handling publicity. Michael Portillo was offered a position but refused, due to his plans to step down from Parliament at the next election.\n\nAlso, a panel of \"grandees\", including John Major, Iain Duncan Smith, William Hague and, notably, Kenneth Clarke has been set up to advise the leadership as they see fit.\n\nOn 2 January 2004, influenced by Saatchi, Howard defined a personal credo and list of core beliefs of the party. At the party conference of October 2004, the Conservatives presented their \"Timetable For Action\" that a Conservative government would follow.\n\nIn the 2005 general election, the Conservative Party made a partial recovery by a net gain of 31 seats, with the Labour majority falling to 66.\n\nThe day after, on 6 May, Howard announced that he believed himself too old to lead the party into another election campaign, and he would therefore be stepping down to allow a new leader the time to prepare for the next election. Howard said that he believed that the party needed to amend the rules governing the election of the Party leader, and that he would allow time for that to happen before resigning. \"See 2005 Conservative Party leadership election\"\n\nThe 2005 campaign received criticism from its main financial backer, Michael Spencer. In an interview with \"The Times\" Tim Collins claimed that the specific reasons the party won more seats may not repeat themselves in the next general election::\n\nDavid Cameron won the subsequent leadership campaign on 6 December 2005. Cameron beat his closest rival David Davis by a margin of more than two to one, taking 134,446 votes to 64,398, and announced his intention to reform and realign the Conservative Party in a manner similar to that achieved by the Labour Party in opposition under Tony Blair. As part of this he distanced from himself from the much hated Conservative Party of the past, for example apologising for Section 28, and focused in on modern environmental issues.\n\nIn April 2006 the party set out to deliver a promise by Cameron to modernise its parliamentary representation. A central candidates' committee reduced some five hundred aspiring politicians on the party's list of approved parliamentary candidates to an \"A-list\" of between 100 and 150 priority candidates. More than half of the names on the resulting list proved to be female, and several were of non-Establishment figures of various kinds.\n\nAfter the party had led in opinion polls for most of Cameron's time in office, a hung parliament was achieved in the 2010 General Election, with the Conservatives achieving the most votes and largest number of seats in parliament. This outcome had been widely predicted and was largely due to a surge in support for the Liberal Democrats. Cameron successfully negotiated with the Liberal Democrats on forming a coalition government.\n\nIn office, David Cameron oversaw an economic recovery and a reduction in government spending, as well as the legalisation of same-sex marriage. He then led the Conservatives to a surprise victory in the 2015 General election in which the Conservatives achieved their first majority since 1992.\n\nThe 2015 election manifesto included a pledge to have a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union (EU), after having promised the plebiscite in 2013. After undertaking a renegotiation of Britain's membership with the EU, the referendum was called for 23 June 2016 and resulted in a vote to leave the EU by 52%. Cameron subsequently resigned as Prime Minister after having taken a key role in campaigning for a continuation of Britain's membership of the EU.\nThe campaign had led to serious tensions in the party and it emerged that Cameron had forbidden the Civil service from doing any serious planning for Brexit apparently because of a fear the plans would be leaked. An investigation by the Foreign affairs select committee described the lack of planning as \"gross negligence\" which made his successor's task much more difficult.\n\nIn July 2016 Theresa May succeeded David Cameron as Tory Leader and Prime Minister following Andrea Leadsom's withdrawal from the leadership contest. She is the second woman to lead the party and subsequently the second female Prime Minister, following Margaret Thatcher.\n\nWith the support of 199/320 Conservative MPs, May was seen as the most experienced figure who could unite the party after a bitter campaign in which Michael Gove, a supporter and running mate of Boris Johnson, publicly declared Johnson unfit to be Prime Minister on the morning he was to launch his campaign, leading to Johnson ruling himself out of the contest and Gove launching his own campaign. After Gove too was eliminated from the contest Leadsom, a junior minister with little experience, caused controversy by claiming she had more of a stake in the future of society than May because she had children when the latter was medically unable to have children. Leadsom subsequently withdrew from the contest, citing a lack of support within the party.\n\nIn her first speech after taking office, May vowed to tackle injustice and social mobility, seen by many as a departure from the Thatcherite consensus that had been continued by her predecessor. She vowed to legislate for the expansion of selective Grammar schools, peg the pay of top executives to those on the lowest wages in big companies whilst bringing an end to the austerity agenda which dominated the previous administration.\n\nAlthough she supported remain in the EU referendum, she appointed several leave supporters to the cabinet in a wide-ranging shake up including Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary and David Davis as Secretary of State for Leaving the EU in a bid to unify the party. On 29 March, Parliament voted to activate Article 50.\n\nWith a majority of 12, reduced to 11 following the defeat of Zac Goldsmith in the Richmond Park by-election, many had speculated whether May would annul the Fixed Term Parliament Act to call an early General Election. However, she ruled that scenario out on a number of occasions, vowing to hold the election in May 2020 as scheduled.\n\nTheresa May changed her mind in April 2017 and called for an early election. This occurred on 8 June 2017, in which the Conservatives lost their majority. \n\nThis resulted in a hung parliament and May agreed a confidence and supply deal with the Democratic Unionist Party to create a tenuous majority. However, since then she has faced calls to resign, agreeing to do so finally in the summer of 2019. A leadership contest to replace her lead to the final pairing of Boris Johnson against Jeremy Hunt. \n\nIn 2019, two new parliamentary caucuses were formed; One Nation Conservatives and Blue Collar Conservatives.\n\nMay resigned as leader upon the election of Johnson as party leader on 23 July and as Prime Minister the following day.\n\nBoris Johnson became Prime Minister in July 2019. He won a landslide victory at the 2019 general election which saw the collapse of the Red wall with the Tories winning Labour held seats for the first time in decades.\n\nRecent policies include a world leading target to reach net zero c02 emissions by 2050, investment in clean energy and the environment, increased school funding, increased funding in science and research, increased police numbers, and increased NHS (National Health Service) funding. In 2019, the Conservative Party became the first major world government to declare a climate emergency declaration. After the 2019 general election, there are now more LGBT+ Conservative MPs in Parliament.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located on the B4396 road, around south-east of the town of Oswestry, and from the county town of Shrewsbury.\n\nThe former name of Knockin was Cnukyn. The village comprises mainly historic detached buildings in a rural setting. The Earl of Bradford owned much of Knockin until it was sold off in lots to meet other financial demands. The Earl still owns the cricket pitch and other small pockets of land in the area. The local public house is called the Bradford Arms and displays the Bradford family coat of arms. The pub also has a clock with three faces, hung outside above the main entrance. The motto displayed on the sign is that of the Bridgeman family Earls of Bradford \"Nec temere nec timide\" (Neither rashly nor timidly).\n\nThe village was struck by an F1/T2 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day. The tornado later moved over Oswestry, causing further damage.\n\nIn 1990 a large part of the village was designated a historical conservation area by Shropshire Council, and it is home to a number of listed buildings.\n\nAll that remains of Knockin Castle today is a large tree-covered mound of earth. The castle was of a motte and bailey design and was constructed between 1154–1160 under the authority of Guy le Strange. Ownership remained with the family for much of the Middle Ages, but by 1540 it was described as \"ruinous\". Like most Shropshire castles which are now only marked by grassy sites, its stones live on in a number of buildings in the area.\n\nThe parish church of St Mary was founded by Ralph Le Strange between 1182 and 1195 as a chapel for the castle. It has a Norman chancel, nave and north aisle but the building was heavily restored in 1846. Its graveyard was consecrated in 1817; before then at least some burials took place at Kinnerley. It contains CWGC-registered war graves of two officers and two soldiers of the British Army of World War I.\n\nOne of the radio telescopes that make up the Jodrell Bank MERLIN (Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network) radio telescope array is in Knockin. The array links several observing stations that together form a powerful telescope.\n\nKnockin is the home of Knockin and Kinnerley Cricket Club. Established as a club in 1862 the club field four league teams, two mid-week teams, junior teams from under 9's to under 15's in addition to ladies and girls-only teams. In June 2018 the club was awarded the Queens Award for Voluntary Service (QAVS), the MBE for volunteer groups. This was a landmark achievement for the club and recognised the tremendous work of their supporters.

His catcher that season was Paul Richards, who in 1938 became Atlanta's player-manager. Richards and Harris would form a decades-long association in baseball at the minor and Major League levels.\n\nThe , Harris compiled a 35–63 record with a 4.16 earned-run average in 151 American League games with the Philadelphia Athletics and (briefly) Washington Senators in 1941–44 and 1946–47. He missed the 1945 season while serving in the United States Navy in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II. As a big leaguer, Harris allowed 874 hits and 265 bases on balls in 820 innings pitched and 151 games, with 232 strikeouts. He pitched at the Triple-A level during his last three active seasons in pro ball.\n\nThe remainder of Harris' Major League career would be spent working in tandem with Richards, initially as a coach with the Chicago White Sox (1951–54), Baltimore Orioles (1955–61) and Houston Colt .45s (1962–64). In each case he worked under Richards, who was either his manager, general manager, or (in Baltimore from 1955 to 1958) both. Despite his playing background, Harris was never a pitching coach; he usually served as a third-base coach.\n\nHarris' first managerial experience came late in the season. Richards stepped down as skipper of the Orioles on August 30 to become the general manager of the expansion Colt .45s, and Harris took command as interim pilot of the OrioIes on September 1. He led them to 17 wins in 27 games (.630), as the club finished third in the American League. After the season, however, Harris rejoined Richards in Houston as a coach, and Billy Hitchcock took over as Baltimore's permanent skipper for .\n\nHarris served for almost three full seasons as a Colt .45 coach under Harry Craft, until September 19, 1964, when Richards promoted him to manager. In , Harris managed the re-christened Houston Astros, serving for the team's debut season in the Astrodome. But the 1965 Astros went only 65–97 to finish ninth in the ten-team National League, and at the end of the year, Richards was fired and Harris was replaced by Grady Hatton as the Astros' pilot. Harris then served as a Houston scout in .\n\nIn August 1966, Richards became the vice president for baseball operations (in effect, general manager) of the Atlanta Braves. After that season, Harris rejoined his old boss in 1967 as skipper of the Richmond Braves, Atlanta's Triple-A farm club. Then, from 1968 to the middle of the 1972 season, Harris managed the big-league Braves (ironically, succeeding Hitchcock).\n\nHarris led Atlanta to 93 victories and the first National League West Division championship in 1969 (both the National and American Leagues now had two divisions after expanding from 10 teams to 12). It was the franchise's first postseason berth since losing the 1958 World Series as the Milwaukee Braves; however, Harris' Braves squad lost the National League Championship Series to the eventual world champion New York Mets. When the Braves slumped in ensuing years, Richards was fired during the 1972 season, on June 1, and Harris was replaced as manager by former Braves' third baseman Eddie Mathews on August 6. Harris' final managerial record was 466–488 (.488).\n\nHarris died due to ill effects of diabetes at age 81 in Pell City, Alabama. He is buried in Birmingham's Elmwood Cemetery.\n\n"}

Until 2002, the film festival was reserved to \"non-aligned and other developing countries\".\n\nThe event originated in 1987 as the Pyongyang Film Festival of the Non-aligned and Other Developing Countries. The maiden event, held from September 1 through September 10, showed short films, features, and documentaries that were judged for competitive awards.\n\nThe film festival returned in 1990 and would be regularly held every other year. Recurrent subject matter included domestic cinema that commonly praised the high leadership such as a film shown at the 1992 film festival, verbosely translated, \"Glory of Our People in Holding the Great Leader in High Esteem\", and foreign films about revolutionary resistance.\n\nIn 2000, officials widened the acceptable breadth of film watching by screening Japanese films for the first time when Yoji Yamada arrived to present six of his films. 2002 saw further relaxation of rules and since then the festival has been open to more than just \"non-aligned and other developing countries\".\n\nThe ninth festival, held in 2004, moderated cultural restrictions further with the screening of a dubbed and censored version of the British comedy \"Bend It Like Beckham\" and U.S.-produced South African drama \"Cry, The Beloved Country\". \"Bend it like Beckham\" won the music prize and later it became the first Western-made film shown on television in North Korea.\n\nIn 2006, the Swedish horror comedy \"Frostbiten\" was shown at the festival, the first foreign horror film to ever be shown in North Korea.\n\n\"The Schoolgirl's Diary\", which premiered at the 2006 festival, in 2007 became the first North Korean film in several decades to be picked up for international distribution, when it was purchased by French company Pretty Pictures. It was released in France in late 2007.\n\nThe festival was held in the autumn every two years until 2018; after that, the festival has become yearly, with the 17th edition organized in September 2019. It has an international jury and both competitive and non-competitive submissions. In that sense, it is \"structured ... very much like any other international film festival\".\n\nSince 2000, the festival has been dominated by films from Western Europe. Many of the films are censored and often have themes emphasising family values, loyalty and the temptations of money. In 2008, 110 films were shown from a total of 46 countries. South Korean films are not shown because of the current political climate. Films critical of North Korean from anywhere in the world are not allowed and neither are sexually explicit films. Anything else goes, and the organizers try to get as many films and visitors to attend. Diplomatic connections or the personal initiative of filmmakers is what often results in a film being admitted. The result is often \"an odd mix\" of films that are not united by one genre. In recent years, the festival has enjoyed recent popularity abroad, mainly due to the success of South Korean cinema prompting foreign film enthusiasts' curiosity about the North. Consequentially, film submissions have increased and the selection of films has improved in quality.\n\nThe festival is one of the few North Korean functions that actively seeks connection with the outside world. Johannes Schönherr, author of \"North Korean Cinema: A History\" and a festival delegate in 2000, said \"The Pyongyang International Film Festival is a big propaganda event and foreigners who attend the event become extras in the big propaganda show.\"\n\nMost Japanese films and all American, Taiwanese and South Korean films are banned in North Korea. The reason on why Taiwanese and South Korean films are banned because of the anti-communist nature of the countries.\n\n\n\n"}

Schwarz was educated at St Paul's School in London, and matriculated to Christ's College, Cambridge in 1893. While at Cambridge he joined the Cambridge University rugby team and in the Varsity Match of 1893 he won his only sporting Blue. Although Schwarz became better known as a cricketer than a rugby player, he did not win a Blue for cricket.\n\nSchwarz won three caps for England against Scotland in 1899, and Wales and Ireland in 1901. At club level, Schwarz played for Richmond and in the 1896–97 season was invited to play for the Barbarians.\n\nSchwarz played a handful of games for Middlesex County Cricket Club in 1901 and 1902 before emigrating to South Africa where he played for Transvaal. It was on his return to England with the South African cricket team in 1904 that he made his mark, having learned from Bernard Bosanquet how to bowl the googly. Unusually, he bowled it as his stock delivery, with considerable success: in 1904 and 1907 he topped the bowling averages, in the latter year taking 137 wickets at just 11.70 apiece, and he was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1908. On that 1907 tour, the first on which South Africa played Tests in England, they had no fewer than four leg-break and googly bowlers, Schwarz having passed on the secret of the googly to Aubrey Faulkner, Bert Vogler and Gordon White.\n\nSchwarz retired from playing regularly after the 1912 season, although he appeared three times for L Robinson's XI over the next two seasons. In all he took 398 wickets at a bowling average of 17.58, and in Tests he took 55 wickets at 22.60. Schwarz made one first class century: 102 runs scored in a non-Test game against an England XI at Lord's in 1904.\n\nSchwarz was a member of the London stock exchange from 1899 to 1902, before joining South African Railways in 1902 after his move to South Africa. From 1904 to 1911, he was a Member of the South African stock exchange until he rejoined the London stock exchange on his return to Britain.\n\nSchwarz was a Major in the King's Royal Rifle Corps of the British Army and fought on the Western Front in World War I. He was given the role of Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General and was Assistant Controller of salvage. For his actions during the war he was Mentioned in Despatches and was awarded the Military Cross. He survived the war, but died in the Spanish flu epidemic at Étaples in northern France just seven days after the Armistice had been signed. He was 43.\n\n\n"}

An example application is the 741 operational amplifier, and Widlar used the circuit as a part in many designs.\n\nThis circuit is named after its inventor, Bob Widlar, and was patented in 1967.\n\nFigure 1 is an example Widlar current source using bipolar transistors, where the emitter resistor R is connected to the output transistor Q, and has the effect of reducing the current in Q relative to Q. The key to this circuit is that the voltage drop across the resistor \"R\" subtracts from the base-emitter voltage of transistor \"Q\", thereby turning this transistor off compared to transistor \"Q\". This observation is expressed by equating the base voltage expressions found on either side of the circuit in Figure 1 as:\n\nwhere β is the beta-value of the output transistor, which is not the same as that of the input transistor, in part because the currents in the two transistors are very different. The variable \"I\" is the base current of the output transistor, \"V\" refers to base-emitter voltage. This equation implies (using the Shockley diode law):\n\n\"Eq. 1\"\n\nwhere \"V\" is the .\n\nThis equation makes the approximation that the currents are both much larger than the scale currents, \"I\" and \"I\"; an approximation valid except for current levels near cut off. In the following, the scale currents are assumed to be identical; in practice, this needs to be specifically arranged.\n\nTo design the mirror, the output current must be related to the two resistor values \"R\" and \"R\". A basic observation is that the output transistor is in active mode only so long as its collector-base voltage is non-zero. Thus, the simplest bias condition for design of the mirror sets the applied voltage \"V\" to equal the base voltage \"V\". This minimum useful value of \"V\" is called the \"compliance voltage\" of the current source. With that bias condition, the Early effect plays no role in the design.\n\nThese considerations suggest the following design procedure:\n\nThe inverse of the design problem is finding the current when the resistor values are known. An iterative method is described next. Assume the current source is biased so the collector-base voltage of the output transistor \"Q\" is zero. The current through \"R\" is the input or reference current given as,\n\nRearranging, \"I\" is found as:\n\n\"Eq. 2\"\n\nThe diode equation provides:\n\n\"Eq. 3\"\n\n\"Eq.1\" provides:\n\nThese three relations are a nonlinear, implicit determination for the currents that can be solved by iteration. \nThis procedure is repeated to convergence, and is set up conveniently in a spreadsheet. One simply uses a macro to copy the new values into the spreadsheet cells holding the initial values to obtain the solution in short order.\n\nNote that with the circuit as shown, if V changes, the output current will change. Hence, to keep the output current constant despite fluctuations in \"V\", the circuit should be driven by a constant current source rather than using the resistor \"R\".\n\nThe transcendental equations above can be solved exactly in terms of the Lambert W function.\n\nAn important property of a current source is its small signal incremental output impedance, which should ideally be infinite. The Widlar circuit introduces local current feedback for transistor formula_14. Any increase in the current in \"Q\" increases the voltage drop across \"R\", reducing the \"V\" for \"Q\", thereby countering the increase in current. This feedback means the output impedance of the circuit is increased, because the feedback involving \"R\" forces use of a larger voltage to drive a given current.\n\nOutput resistance is found using a small-signal model for the circuit, shown in Figure 2. Transistor \"Q\" is replaced by its small-signal emitter resistance \"r\" because it is diode connected. Transistor \"Q\" is replaced with its hybrid-pi model. A test current \"I\" is attached at the output.\n\nUsing the figure, the output resistance is determined using Kirchhoff's laws. Using Kirchhoff's voltage law from the ground on the left to the ground connection of \"R\":\n\nRearranging:\n\nUsing Kirchhoff's voltage law from the ground connection of \"R\" to the ground of the test current:\n\nor, substituting for \"I\":\n\n\"Eq. 4\"\n\nAccording to \"Eq. 4\", the output resistance of the Widlar current source is increased over that of the output transistor itself (which is \"r\") so long as \"R\" is large enough compared to the \"r\" of the output transistor (large resistances \"R\" make the factor multiplying \"r\" approach the value (β + 1)). The output transistor carries a low current, making \"r\" large, and increase in \"R\" tends to reduce this current further, causing a correlated increase in \"r\". Therefore, a goal of \"R\" ≫ \"r\" can be unrealistic, and further discussion is provided below. The resistance \"R\"∥\"r\" usually is small because the emitter resistance \"r\" usually is only a few ohms.\n\nThe current dependence of the resistances \"r\" and \"r\" is discussed in the article hybrid-pi model. The current dependence of the resistor values is:\n\nand\n\nis the output resistance due to the Early effect when \"V\" = 0 V (device parameter \"V\" is the Early voltage).\n\nFrom earlier in this article (setting the scale currents equal for convenience):\n\"Eq. 5\"\n\nConsequently, for the usual case of small \"r\", and neglecting the second term in \"R\" with the expectation that the leading term involving \"r\" is much larger:\n\"Eq. 6\"\n\nwhere the last form is found by substituting \"Eq. 5\" for \"R\". \"Eq. 6\" shows that a value of output resistance much larger than \"r\" of the output transistor results only for designs with \"I\" » \"I\". Figure 3 shows that the circuit output resistance \"R\" is not determined so much by feedback as by the current dependence of the resistance \"r\" of the output transistor (the output resistance in Figure 3 varies four orders of magnitude, while the feedback factor varies only by one order of magnitude).\n\nIncrease of \"I\" to increase the feedback factor also results in increased compliance voltage, not a good thing as that means the current source operates over a more restricted voltage range. So, for example, with a goal for compliance voltage set, placing an upper limit upon \"I\", and with a goal for output resistance to be met, the maximum value of output current \"I\" is limited.\n\nThe center panel in Figure 3 shows the design trade-off between emitter leg resistance and the output current: a lower output current requires a larger leg resistor, and hence a larger area for the design. An upper bound on area therefore sets a lower bound on the output current and an upper bound on the circuit output resistance.\n\n\"Eq. 6\" for \"R\" depends upon selecting a value of \"R\" according to \"Eq. 5\". That means \"Eq. 6\" is not a \"circuit behavior\" formula, but a \"design value\" equation. Once \"R\" is selected for a particular design objective using \"Eq. 5\", thereafter its value is fixed. If circuit operation causes currents, voltages or temperatures to deviate from the designed-for values; then to predict changes in \"R\" caused by such deviations, \"Eq. 4\" should be used, not \"Eq. 6\".\n\n\n"}

Roughly stated, the theorem says that if a formula φ implies a formula ψ, and the two have at least one atomic variable symbol in common, then there is a formula ρ, called an interpolant, such that every nonlogical symbol in ρ occurs both in φ and ψ, φ implies ρ, and ρ implies ψ. The theorem was first proved for first-order logic by William Craig in 1957. Variants of the theorem hold for other logics, such as propositional logic. A stronger form of Craig's interpolation theorem for first-order logic was proved by Roger Lyndon in 1959; the overall result is sometimes called the Craig–Lyndon theorem.\n\nIn propositional logic, let\n\nThen formula_3 tautologically implies formula_4. This can be verified by writing formula_3 in conjunctive normal form:\nThus, if formula_3 holds, then formula_8 holds. In turn, formula_8 tautologically implies formula_4. Because the two propositional variables occurring in formula_8 occur in both formula_3 and formula_4, this means that formula_8 is an interpolant for the implication formula_15.\n\nSuppose that \"S\" and \"T\" are two first-order theories. As notation, let \"S\" ∪ \"T\" denote the smallest theory including both \"S\" and \"T\"; the signature of \"S\" ∪ \"T\" is the smallest one containing the signatures of \"S\" and \"T\". Also let \"S\" ∩ \"T\" be the intersection of the languages of the two theories; the signature of \"S\" ∩ \"T\" is the intersection of the signatures of the two languages.\n\nLyndon's theorem says that if \"S\" ∪ \"T\" is unsatisfiable, then there is an interpolating sentence ρ in the language of \"S\" ∩ \"T\" that is true in all models of \"S\" and false in all models of \"T\". Moreover, ρ has the stronger property that every relation symbol that has a positive occurrence in ρ has a positive occurrence in some formula of \"S\" and a negative occurrence in some formula of \"T\", and every relation symbol with a negative occurrence in ρ has a negative occurrence in some formula of \"S\" and a positive occurrence in some formula of \"T\".\n\nWe present here a constructive proof of the Craig interpolation theorem for propositional logic. Formally, the theorem states:\n\n\"If ⊨φ → ψ then there is a ρ (the \"interpolant\") such that ⊨φ → ρ and ⊨ρ → ψ, where atoms(ρ) ⊆ atoms(φ) ∩ atoms(ψ). Here atoms(φ) is the set of propositional variables occurring in φ, and ⊨ is the semantic entailment relation for propositional logic.\"\n\nProof.\nAssume ⊨φ → ψ. The proof proceeds by induction on the number of propositional variables occurring in φ that do not occur in ψ, denoted |\"atoms\"(φ) − \"atoms\"(ψ)|.\n\nBase case |\"atoms\"(φ) − \"atoms\"(ψ)| = 0: Since |\"atoms\"(φ) − \"atoms\"(ψ)| = 0, we have that \"atoms\"(φ) ⊆ \"atoms\"(φ) ∩ \"atoms\"(ψ). Moreover we have that ⊨φ → φ and ⊨φ → ψ. This suffices to show that φ is a suitable interpolant in this case.\n\nLet’s assume for the inductive step that the result has been shown for all χ where |\"atoms\"(χ) − \"atoms\"(ψ)| = n. Now assume that |\"atoms\"(φ) − \"atoms\"(ψ)| = n+1. Pick a \"q\" ∈ \"atoms\"(φ) but \"q\" ∉ \"atoms\"(ψ). Now define:\n\nφ' := φ[⊤/\"q\"] ∨ φ[⊥/\"q\"]\n\nHere φ[⊤/\"q\"] is the same as φ with every occurrence of \"q\" replaced by ⊤ and φ[⊥/\"q\"] similarly replaces \"q\" with ⊥. We may observe three things from this definition:\n\nFrom , and the inductive step we have that there is an interpolant ρ such that:\n\nBut from and we know that\n\nHence, ρ is a suitable interpolant for φ and ψ.\n\nQED\n\nSince the above proof is constructive, one may extract an algorithm for computing interpolants. Using this algorithm, if \"n\" = |\"atoms\"(φ') − \"atoms\"(ψ)|, then the interpolant ρ has \"O\"(\"EXP\"(\"n\")) more logical connectives than φ (see Big O Notation for details regarding this assertion). Similar constructive proofs may be provided for the basic modal logic K, intuitionistic logic and μ-calculus, with similar complexity measures.\n\nCraig interpolation can be proved by other methods as well. However, these proofs are generally non-constructive:\n\nCraig interpolation has many applications, among them consistency proofs, model checking, proofs in modular specifications, modular ontologies.\n\n"}

They were initially thought to be bivalves, but were later given their own class. They have a single shell in their larval stage, and the adult typically has a single, pseudo-bivalved shell enclosing the mantle and muscular foot. The anterior part of the shell probably pointed downward and had a gap from which the foot could probably emerge. Rostroconchs probably lived a sedentary semi-infaunal lifestyle. There were probably more than 1,000 species of members of this class.\n\nApproximately 3 dozen genera and an even greater number of species have been described. Generally, rostroconchs are small, less than two centimeters in length, but larger forms, found in United States Devonian limestones, can grow to a length of 15 cm.\n\nExternally, rostroconchs look much like bivalves and rostroconchs probably had an extendable muscular foot, indicated by a prominent anterior gape in the rostroconch's shell. It seems, however, that the internal anatomy and morphology of the foot were closer to that of the scaphopods.\n\nRostroconchs began their life as a small, bilaterally symmetrical, univalved protoconch planktonic larva. The bilateral shell grew into two valves as the rostroconch entered adulthood. Adult rostroconchs differ from bivalves because they have no functional hinge. Unlike the shell of a bivalve, which was able to move or articulate, the shell layers of a rostroconch — the layers of rigid calcite— continue across the whole dorsal area of the rostroconch. The two valves would have been rigidly fixed in place, and would have to have been broken periodically to allow the rostroconch shell to grow.\n\nThe posterior of the shell contains a flattened tube that is called the rostrum. The rostroconch probably burrowed itself into sediment, anterior first, leaving the rostrum above the sediment to be used as a water filtration system.\n\n\"Heraultipegma\" is the earliest, very primitive, rostroconch genus dating from the Late Terreneuvian. True Rostroconchs appeared during the Ordovician, heavily competing with the bivalves until their decline in the end-early Ordovician turnover.\n\nEarly, primitive rostroconchs such as \"Ribeiroia\" had a hinge in which all shell layers covered the dorsal region resulting in a very rigid shell. In \"Conocardium\", a more advanced rostroconch, the outer shell layers do not cross the entire margin, suggesting independent steps towards the bivalve flexible hinge.\n\nSome evidence suggests that the conocardoid rostroconchs were the predecessors to the Scaphopoda.\n\n"}

The place is known for a massacre that took place at a refugee camp connected to the village.\n\nOn August 13, 2004, a refugee camp in Gatumba was the scene of one of the largest civilian massacres carried out in Burundi in recent years. \n\nA force of armed combatants, many of them members of the Forces for National Liberation (FNL), massacred at least 166 Congolese civilians and wounded another 106. The FNL is a predominantly Hutu rebel movement known for its hostility to Tutsi and the victims were largely Banyamulenge, a group often categorized with Tutsi. The FNL is believed to have been behind a series of other attacks, including the December 28, 2000 Titanic Express massacre.\n\nBrigadier-General Germain Niyoyankana, head of the Burundian army, accused Congolese troops of complicity in the killings. \n\nFollowing the FNL's admission of responsibility for the Gatumba massacre, the Burundian government issued arrest warrants for the group's leader, Agathon Rwasa, and declared its intention to refer the matter to the International Criminal Court. The United Nations issued a resolution condemning the attack, and the African Union declared the FNL a terrorist organisation. No arrests have yet been made.\n\nIn October 2005, the FNL issued a statement condemning the Gatumba massacre, denouncing Agathon Rwasa for leading a \"descent into hell\", and announcing that he had been replaced.

{"id": "2056815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056815", "title": "Void type", "text": "Void type\n\nThe void type, in several programming languages derived from C and Algol68, is the type for the result of a function that returns normally, but does not provide a result value to its caller. Usually such functions are called for their side effects, such as performing some task or writing to their output parameters. The usage of the void type in such context is comparable to procedures in Pascal and syntactic constructs which define subroutines in Visual Basic. It is also similar to the unit type used in functional programming languages and type theory. See Unit type#In programming languages for a comparison.\n\nC and C++ also support the pointer to void type (specified as codice_1), but this is an unrelated notion. Variables of this type are pointers to data of an \"unspecified\" type, so in this context (but not the others) codice_1 acts roughly like a universal or top type. A program can probably convert a pointer to any type of data (except a function pointer) to a pointer to void and back to the original type without losing information, which makes these pointers useful for polymorphic functions. The C language standard does not guarantee that the different pointer types have the same size.\n\nA function with void result type ends either by reaching the end of the function or by executing a return statement with no returned value. The void type may also appear as the sole argument of a function prototype to indicate that the function takes no arguments. Note that despite the name, in all of these situations, the void type serves as a unit type, not as a zero or bottom type (which \nis sometimes confusingly called the \"void type\"), even though unlike a real unit type which is a singleton, the void type lacks a way to represent its value and the language does not provide any way to declare an object or represent a value with type codice_3.\n\nIn the earliest versions of C, functions with no specific result defaulted to a return type of codice_4 and functions with no arguments simply had empty argument lists. Pointers to untyped data were declared as integers or pointers to codice_5. Some early C compilers had the feature, now seen as an annoyance, of generating a warning on any function call that did not use the function's returned value. Old code sometimes casts such function calls to void to suppress this warning. By the time Bjarne Stroustrup began his work on C++ in 1979–1980, void and void pointers were part of the C language dialect supported by AT&T-derived compilers.\n\nThe explicit use of void vs. giving no arguments in a function prototype has different semantics in C and C++, as detailed in the following table:\n\nA C prototype taking no arguments, e.g. codice_6 above, has been deprecated in C99, however.\n\nQuite contrary to C++, in the functional programming language Haskell the void type denotes the empty type, which has no inhabitants . A function into the void type does not return results, and a side-effectful program with type signature codice_7 does not terminate, or crashes. In particular, there are no total functions into the void type.\n"}

Born in Wunsiedel in Bavaria, he was professor of zoology at Erlangen university.\n\nEugen and his brother Friedrich were introduced to natural history at an early age by their father Friedrich Lorenz Esper, an amateur botanist. Encouraged to abandon his theology course by his professor of botany Casimir Christoph Schmidel (1718–1792) Eugen Esper, instead, took instruction in natural history.\n\nHe obtained his doctorate of philosophy at the university of Erlangen in 1781 with a thesis entitled \"De varietatibus specierum in naturale productis\". The following year, he started to teach at the university initially as extraordinary professor, a poorly paid position, then in 1797 as the professor of philosophy. He directed the department of natural history in Erlangen from 1805. Thanks to him the university collections of minerals, birds, plants, shells and insects grew very rapidly.\n\nDuring his leisure hours Esper devoted himself to the study of nature and the preparation of manuscripts relating to natural history. He was the author of a series of booklets entitled \"Die Schmetterlinge in Abbildungen nach der Natur mit Beschreibungen\" which were published between 1776 and 1807. These were richly illustrated; minerals, birds, plants, shells and insects being presented on 438 hand-coloured plates. A second work was published in 1829–1830 with Toussaint de Charpentier (1779–1847). This is an important work on the butterflies of Germany, following the Linnean System. Esper was also the very first person to research palaeopathology.\n\nThe review of entomology, \"Esperiana, Buchreihe zur Entomologie\", created in 1990, commemorates his name and work.\n\nEsper's collection is in the Zoologische Staatssammlung München \n\nTranslated from French Wikipedia on Esper\n\n"}

Launched on May 26, 1967 the operation ended June 5. U.S. reported the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) lost 594 killed and 23 captured, while U.S. casualties were 110 killed and 241 wounded.\n\nThe Que Son Valley is located along the border of Quang Nam and Quang Tin provinces. During the Vietnam War it lay in the southern part of South Vietnam's I Corps. Populous and rice-rich, the valley was viewed as one of the keys to controlling South Vietnam's five northern provinces by the North Vietnamese and by early 1967 at least two regiments of the PAVN 2nd Division had been infiltrated into the area. The Quế Sơn Valley was also recognized as strategically important by the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV). The 1st Battalion, 5th Marines and 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, experienced units that had fought in Vietnam since their arrival in the summer of 1966, were assigned to the valley in 1967 to support the outnumbered the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces in the area.\n\nDuring Operation Union from 21 April to 16 May, the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines had fought the PAVN 21st Regiment near the Marine outpost on Loc Son Mountain for control of the southern part of the Quế Sơn Valley. Operation Union II was launched on May 26 to destroy the withdrawing remnants of the PAVN with a helicopter assault by the 5th Marine Regiment, commanded by Colonel Kenneth J. Houghton. The assault was coordinated with ground attacks by the ARVN 6th Regiment, 2nd Division and the 1st Ranger Group.\n\nThe plan called for 1/5 Marines, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Hilgartner, to establish blocking positions in the western portion of the valley while the 3/5 Marines, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Esslinger, was to make a heliborne assault into the southern part of the valley and sweep northeast. Meanwhile, the three battalions of the ARVN Ranger Group would attack southwest from Thang Binh, while two units of the 6th Regiment attacked northwest from a position near Tam Kỳ. The ARVN named their participation Operation Lien Ket 106.\n\nThe operation began the morning of 26 May with the 1/5 Marines and ARVN troop movements proceeding as planned. 3/5 Marines, composed of three infantry companies, one weapons company and a command group, was carried by helicopters to Landing Zone Eagle, an area 5km east of the Loc Son outpost. The first two waves to arrive at the landing zone (LZ) experienced only light small arms fire, but as the bulk of the battalion landed the LZ was subjected to heavy weapon and mortar fire. An attack by Companies L and M launched to relieve the pressure on the LZ found a well-entrenched PAVN force, identified as being elements of the PAVN 3rd Regiment, northeast of the LZ.\n\nSupported by artillery and air strikes, Company I enveloped the PAVN's flank, and the Marines soon gained the upper hand. By late afternoon the Marines had overrun the last PAVN positions, counting PAVN 118 dead for Marine losses of 38 killed and 82 wounded. The Marine and ARVN forces swept the area for the next three days but contacts declined as the PAVN withdrew from the area. Concluding that the enemy had been routed, the ARVN ended their part of the operation.\n\nColonel Houghton however was not convinced and responding to intelligence reports, he directed the 5th Marines to continue sweeping the region. On the morning of 2 June the Regiment was sweeping toward the Vinh Huy Village complex. 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines encountered 200 PAVN troops entrenched 1 km east of the scene of the 26 May battle, engaging and overrunning the PAVN by 1:30 that afternoon. Meanwhile, the 1/5 Marines, pushing forward to relieve pressure on the 3/5 Marines, was ambushed by PAVN troops while crossing a 1,000-meter-wide rice paddy. Caught in a crossfire the Marines were pinned down and consolidated their positions while calling artillery and air strikes on enemy positions. During heavy fighting Company F, commanded by Captain James A. Graham, was decimated. Captain Graham was awarded a posthumous Medal of Honor for defending to the last his company’s dead and wounded.\n\nAt 14:00 Colonel Houghton called for the commitment of the 1st Marine Division's Reserve \"Bald Eagle Reactionary Force\", a battalion sized reactionary force unit made up of Company E, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines; Company D, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines; and Company E, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines and commanded by Lt. Col. Mallett C. Jackson Jr., the Battalion Commander of 2/5 Marines. At 19:00, in total darkness, Companies E, 2/5 Marines and D, 1/7 Marines were inserted by helicopter northeast of the fortified enemy positions and quickly moved south to engage the PAVN's left flank positions in order to relieve battle pressure on the 5th Marine, that were now pinned down by a large entrenched PAVN force The 2 companies quickly moved forward but were soon hit with heavy automatic weapons fire and heavy barrages of large 82 mm high explosive mortar rounds. Company D, 1/7 Marines had taken many casualties and they radioed requests for Medevac choppers, but all requests were denied because of the extreme darkness. However a CH-53 helicopter that had just dropped off the Company E, 2/7 Marines at the original landing zone heard the desperate call and was guided in to the landing zone directly in the middle of the battlefield. When the helicopter returned to Da Nang Air Base, it was noted that it had received a total of 57 holes in its sides from the exploding mortar rounds and automatic weapons fire during the battlefield landing. The sudden presence of the strong Division Reactionary Force on its northern flank caused the PAVN units to disengage and make a hasty withdrawal to the southwest, but the move proved costly to them. Once the PAVN soldiers left the protection of their fortifications, they were easy targets for the Marines supporting arms fire.\n\nThe unwelcome discovery of a strong enemy force on its northern flank prompted the PAVN forces to attempt a hasty withdrawal during the night, exposing themselves to Marine supporting arms fire. Meanwhile, the 5th Marines regrouped and evacuated casualties. The Marines themselves suffered 71 killed and 139 wounded in the battle. The following morning, when the battalions swept the battle area, 476 PAVN dead were counted in and around the contested rice paddy and its formidable hedgerow complex. 31 weapons were captured.\n\nThe action of June 2–3 marked the last significant battle of Operation Union II. The Marines claimed PAVN casualties were 701 killed and 23 captured, a favorable ratio to 110 Marines killed and 241 wounded. For actions in both Union I and Union II the 5th Marines and all units under its operational control, including the division reactionary force companies of Company D, 1/7 Marines and Company E, 2/7 Marines received the Presidential Unit Citation for its actions during Operation Union II awarded by President Lyndon Johnson.\n\nFor three months, the PAVN 2nd Division was no longer an effective fighting force.\n\n"}

Her father, Boris Leonidovich Ratushinsky, was an engineer; her mother, Irina Valentinovna Ratushinskaya, was a teacher of Russian literature. Irina had one sister. Her mother's family originated from Poland: her maternal great-grandfather was deported from Poland to Siberia, shortly after the January 1863 Uprising against forced conscription into the Russian Imperial Army.\n\nRatushinskaya was educated at Odessa University and graduated with a master's degree in physics in 1976. Before and after her graduation she taught from 1975 to 1978 at a primary school in her native Odessa.\n\nOn 17 September 1982 Ratushinskaya was arrested and accused of anti-Soviet agitation for writing and circulating her collections of verse. \n\nBetween 1 and 3 March 1983, she was tried in Kiev and convicted of \"agitation carried on for the purpose of subverting or weakening the Soviet regime\" (Article 62). Ratushinskaya received the maximum sentence of seven years in a strict-regime labor camp, followed by five years of internal exile. After being imprisoned three and a half years, including one year in solitary confinement in an unheated cell while temperatures fell to minus 40C in the winter, she was released on 9 October 1986, on the eve of the summit in Reykjavík, Iceland between President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nWhile imprisoned Ratushinskaya continued to write poetry. Her previous works usually centered on love, Christian theology, and artistic creation, not on politics or policies as her accusers stated. Her new works that were written in prison, which were written with a matchstick on soap until memorized and then washed away, number some 250. They expressed an appreciation for human rights; liberty, freedom, and the beauty of life. Her memoir, \"Grey is the Colour of Hope\", chronicles her prison experience. Her later poems recount her struggles to endure the hardships and horrors of prison life. Ratushinskaya was a member of International PEN, who monitored her situation during her incarceration.\n\nIn 1987 Ratushinskaya moved to the United States, where she received the Religious Freedom Award of the Institute on Religion and Democracy. In the same year the Politburo deprived both Irina and her husband of their Soviet citizenship. She was Poet-in-Residence at Northwestern University in Illinois (USA) from 1987 to 1989. For the next ten years Ratushinskaya lived in London, UK, until December 1998, when the family returned to Russia to educate their seven-year-old twins in Russian schools. Irina and her husband Igor had spent one year undergoing various procedures to regain their Russian citizenship, including letters and appeals to President Boris Yeltsin.\n\nRatushinskaya died in Moscow on 5 July 2017 from cancer. She was survived by her husband, human rights activist Igor Gerashchenko, and their two sons. Memorial events were held for Irina in Moscow and other cities of Russia, including in Chelyabinsk in August 2019. A request was sent by Oleg to Google to dispel the false claims of kidney cancer as the cause of death. Though the cause of death was, indeed, cancer, the details are not to be published and speculation behalf people who were not present to support Irina during her final days was considered inappropriate by her sons.\n\n\nIrina Leskova set her poems into songs\n\nNot all of Irina's works got to be published.\nIn 1996 the family set off for a vacation in Greece together with their two sons (aged 4 at the time), family friends and their two children (aged 6 and 8). The mothers took turns looking after all 4 children, and Irina's way of keeping all of them somewhat disciplined and entertained was manifested in a series of stories she invented about the adventures of a naughty girl called Cinderella, who wore shoes size 45 and enjoyed robbing banks together with the naughty prince of Bencionia, and giving a headache to the strict King Bencione. The series was loved by all four of the children who, eager to hear what was to happen next, were glad to do as they were told. Eventually, the storytelling was attended by the other 3 parents, who loved the series, particularly after hearing of Cinderella and the prince's vacation in Cuba, where they shaved Fidel Castro bald in his sleep. The series were told but never written down by Irina.\nA play 'Борцу не больно' (the wrestler does not hurt) was written in 2 parts for a film on sambo, however, it was not used in the film, apart from some of the character's names.\nIrina died of cancer before she could finish her last novel, Azor's paw. The 13 written chapters are kept by her family, the first chapter being translated to English by her son Oleg at Irina's final request for him.\n\nIrina's life has had a long-lasting impact on many throughout the world, serving as a source of spiritual inspiration. Her books have been translated into English, German, French, Japanese and other languages and published in many countries. \n\nA Russian edition of \"Grey is the Colour of Hope\" was to be launched at the Museum of the Gulag in Moscow in January 2019. Meanwhile, the 7-lesson English course Irina wrote has been enhanced by Oleg and turned into a broad range of courses for children, teens, students and adults. They have been taught in Russia and China, and today provide full-time self-employment for Oleg.\n\n\n"}

An ILS is not necessary within a local area network and some wide area networks in the Internet because one participant can type in the IP address of the other participant's host and call them directly. An ILS becomes necessary when one participant is trying to contact a host who has a private IP address internal to a local area network that is inaccessible to the outside world, or when the host is blocked by a firewall. An ILS is also useful when a participant has a different IP address during each session, e.g., assigned by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\nThere are two main approaches to using Internet Location Servers: use a public server on the Internet, or run and use a private server.\n\nThe machine running an Internet Location Server must have a public IP address.\nIf the network running an Internet Location Server has a firewall, it is usually necessary to run the server in the demilitarized zone of the network.\n\nMicrosoft Windows includes an Internet Location Server.

Like its predecessor \"Running with Scissors with Mr. Interesting\" in 1999, it starred Dan Redican reprising the title role from The Frantics' \"Frantic Times\" radio series.\n\nThis often-surreal comedy show featured a number of sketches strung together that formed a rough narrative having Mr. Interesting and his best friend Eddie (a giant talking carp played by Colin Mochrie), smuggle themselves across the Canada–US border and who are then beset by a number of odd situations and characters.\n\nThe basic format of the show had the main story of Mr. Interesting and Eddie making their way illegally across the Canada–US border, and then through the mid-west and eventually to Hollywood. Interspersed with this storyline were \"slice-of-life\" sketched involving other random characters. Some of these skits included an Amish farmer dating a supermodel, a bickering family in a car who collide with a beam of God's pure love, and a man visiting a shoe store looking for gay-friendly shoes. The show was ultimately less an exposé of life in the United States and more an exploration of contemporary mores, American cultural clichés and a sometimes scathing critique of the show business industry. Perhaps tellingly, both Mr. Interesting and Eddie the carp are ultimately gunned down and die by the show's conclusion.\n\nThe shows were recorded live in front of an audience at the Toronto's Tim Sims Theatre over a three-day period, from April 13–15, 2000. Besides Redican and Mochrie, the cast also included Kathy Greenwood and Kathleen Laskey. It was written by Redican and Jenny Hacker.\n\n"}

Skovgaard; 4 April 1817 – 13 April 1875) was a Danish national romantic landscape painter. He is one of the main figures associated with the Golden Age of Danish Painting. He is especially known for his large scale portrayals of the Danish landscape.\n\nSkovgaard was born near Ringsted to farmer Tham Masmann Skovgaard and his wife Cathrine Elisabeth. The family had to leave the farm when he was six years old. They moved to Vejby in north Sjælland where his father earned his living as a grocer. Already as a young child he impressed his family with his artistic abilities. His mother, who had studied art under flower painter Claudius Ditlev Fritsch, gave him instructions in drawing until he was confirmed and could be sent to Copenhagen for training at the Royal Danish Academy of Art (\"Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi\").\n\nHe started his training at the Academy in 1831. He did not think much of this training or of that under private lessons starting in 1836 with J. L. Lund, romantic history painter. More advantageous to him, he felt, were the time he spent learning craft painting; the time he spent visiting the Danish Royal Painting Collection, now the National Museum of Art and studying the classical Dutch landscapes in their collection; the outdoors studies he did with friends Christian Gotfred Rump, J. Th. Lundbye, Thorald Læssøe, Dankvart Dreyer and Lorens Frølich; and the many evenings he spent with other young artists at sculptor and Academy professor Herman Ernst Freunds' fashionable house. Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, Academy professor, former Director and long-standing rival of Lund, although not Skovgaard's teacher, played an influential role by encouraging and arranging field studies for Academy students to paint outdoors, including to Jægersborg Dyrehave, an area which Skovgaard featured several times in his mature work.\n\nIn 1836 he started at the Academy's School of Model Painting, and exhibited at Charlottenborg for the first time. His painting \"Måneskinsstykke med Motiv fra Langebro\" (\"Moonlight piece with Motif from Langebro\") was purchased by Crown Prince Christian Frederick and is now in the collection of the Copenhagen City Museum. \n\nWith the attention and encouragement of such highly regarded contemporaries as Niels Lauritz Høyen, art critic, historian and Academy professor whom he admired, and Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, noted archaeologist and museum administrator, Skovgaard got the nerve to focus his career goals on art, and turn away from craft painting.\n\nAt first Skovgaard painted more than just landscapes; he also painted portraits, interiors with figures, as well as watercolor illustrations of Hans Christian Andersen's adventure tales, that are now in The Royal Engraving Collection (\"Den kongelige Kobberstiksamling\"). \n\nBut landscape painting soon took the better part of his interest and attention. And with this focus he became recognised for his talents in truthfully and ideally depicting the nature of Denmark, based on careful study and on artistic and technical skills and training. He painted numerous paintings in and around Vejby, his family's home area, in these early years, and he showed many different influences before developing his own assured style.\n\nIn 1837 and 1838 the Copenhagen Art Union (\"Kunstforening\"), under the leadership of Høyen, purchased several of his paintings. And in 1839 the Danish Royal Painting Collection (\"Den kongelige Malerisamling\") purchased the large scale \"Udsigt mod Frederiksværk fra Tisvilde Skov\" (\"View to Frederiksværk from Tisvilde Forest\"). This work distinguishes itself clearly from those landscapes painted by his contemporaries both by the harsh wildness of the subject matter, and by its dark moodiness. This was also atypical of his later work, which was much more peaceful.\n\nIn 1841 he made a painting of Frederiksborg Palace, which hangs there today.\n\nDuring the 1840s he traveled around the country painting views of the landscape, often with friend and contemporary artist Lundbye. One of the landscapes from his home town \"I udkanten af landsbyen Vejby, Lundbye sidder ved vejkanten og tegner\" (\"On the Outskirts of Vejby Village, Lundbye Sits at the Side of the Road and Draws\") painted in 1843 shows Lundbye at work. Lundbye and Skovgaard spent the summer of 1943 together in the area around Vejby. Another well-known work from this same period is \"Havremark ved Vejby\" (\"Oat Field near Vejby\"). \nThat same year he traveled to Møn and painted \"Parti fra Møns Klint\" (\"View from Møns Klint\"), which features the island's unique, monumental white chalk cliffs. The painting is in the collection of local \"Storstrøms Kunstmuseum\" (Storstrøms Art Museum).\n\nThat same year he exhibited at Charlottenborg and received the established art world's recognition by winning the Neuhausen prize (\"Neuhausenske Præmie\") for the painting \"Det gamle Egetræ med Storkereden i Nordskoven ved Jægerspris\" (\"The Old Oak Tree with Stork Nest in the North Forest near Jægerspris\"), which also came into the Danish Royal Painting Collection. This painting shows a strong development in his landscape painting abilities. In 1844 he exhibited \"Parti af Sjællands Kyst ved Dronningemøllen, Foraarsdag med uroligt Vejr\" (\"View of Sjælland's Coast by Droningemøllen, Stormy Spring Day\") also known as \"Åens Udløb\" (\"The Stream's Outflow\"), which also came into the royal collection. \n\nIn 1845 he won the Artists Exhibition Medallion for his large \"Udsigt over Skarrit Sø\" (\"View Over Lake Skarrit\"), which came into the National Collection, as the Danish Royal Painting Collection came to be known around this time. He also exhibited \"Parti ved Udkanten af Tisvilde Skov\" (\"View at the Edge of Tisvilde Forest\"), which was purchased by Høyen's Art Union.\n\nInstead of seeking a travel stipend from the Academy, Skovgaard chose to follow his friend Høyen's advice and continue to develop his craft in Denmark using Danish landscapes as his subject matter. In the years to follow he traveled around in northern Sjælland every summer to do studies, which he then reworked as large paintings in his studio every winter. These have resulted in such works as \"Sommermiddag i Dyrehaven\" (\"Summer Day in Dyrehaven\") painted in 1848, and \"Landevej ved Herregaarden Vognserup\" (\"Country Road near Vognserup Estate\") painted in 1849. The latter was painted in memory of his friend Lundbye, who died in early 1848. After 1850 he developed a monumental form of expression that held great importance for the following generation of artists.\n\nHe married Georgia Marie Louise Schouw on 3 September 1851. She was the daughter of Professor J.F. Schouw, botanist and politician, and was also an artist. She is primarily known for her embroideries, many of which were based on drawings by the leading artists of the day, including Lundbye, Constantin Hansen as well as her husband. The Skovgaards had a happy marriage which resulted in three children—Suzette Cathrine, Joakim, and Niels. \n\nHe was recognized as Denmark's foremost landscape painter, and received many orders for his works. He particularly enjoyed painting at Jægersborg Dyrehave, but often went further north on Sjælland, for example to Hellebæk where he painted \"Aften ved Bondedammen\" (\"Evening by the Farm Pond\").\n\nHe traveled out of the county with a stipend from the Academy first in 1854. He spent the winter in Italy, along with both his wife, Høyen and Wilhelm Marstrand. He produced several paintings based on this trip, including two views of Venice, a Roman landscape and a portrait of Høyen preparing to meet the Pope.\n\nShortly after his homecoming in 1855 he painted his well-known \"Bøgeskov i maj\" (\"Beech Forest in May\") featuring the quintessential Danish beech forest.\n\nIn 1860 he became titular professor at the Academy. He traveled to London and Paris in 1862 along with Høyen; his work was exhibited at the World's Exhibition in London that year. He was accepted as member of the Academy in 1864. He traveled again to London and Paris in 1866.\n\nHis wife died in 1868, and shortly afterwards he suffered a case of apoplexy. He recovered rather quickly, being able to continue painting soon afterwards with no ill effects. \n\nIn 1869 he returned to Italy together with Marstrand under an award from the Ancker Fund (\"Anckerske Legat\"), and painted several Italian landscapes. That same year he painted \"En Skovsø, Sommeraften\" (\"A Forest Lake, Summer Evening\") and in 1874 \"En Sommerdag i Dyrehaven; et Tordenvejr er trukket forbi og Solen atter kommen frem\" (\"A Summer Day in Dyrehave; a Thunderstorm has Passed and the Sun Comes Out Again\"), two paintings considered among his most important and harmonious works. The latter was his last large work, and was an important study example of his technique for his students.\n\nHe painted portraits of each of his three children between 1871-1874. He died on 13 April 1875 in Copenhagen at the age of 58. A religious man, he died quickly after suffering another apoplexy attack as he came out of church with his children. He is buried in Assistens Cemetery (\"Assistens Kirkegård\") in Copenhagen. Two of his children, Joakim and Niels, would follow in his footsteps and become artists.\n\nHis work was exhibited in the World's Exhibition in Paris in 1878 and 1889, and at the international Art Exhibition in Vienna in 1882.\n\nSkovgaard is primarily known for his landscape paintings, and for the special role he played in portraying Denmark's nature; not the spectacular but the ordinary and typical. He helped develop a unique Danish art form and sensibility. He had a deep sympathy for the Danish landscape and its uniqueness, especially Denmark's beloved beech forests. Animal life and locals that belonged to the land populated these landscapes. He studied nature diligently, and tried to portray it faithfully, yet ideally, and with a love of his country. He was a master of composition, and in his later works he developed an increasing interest in portraying atmosphere and light. The scale of his paintings was a breakthrough in Danish art.\n\nHe is considered one of the leading landscape painters of the 1800s.\n\nHis art production and academic career had a large influence on landscape painting's future in Denmark.\n\nHe occasionally painted portraits. These skillful works include paintings of his family and children, of fellow artists such as Lundbye (1841), of friends such as Amelie Elisabeth Freunds (1860), H. E. Freunds' wife, and of society's important people such as N.F.S. Grundtvig (1847), whom Skovgaard greatly admired.\n\nHis work has been shown both in Denmark and internationally in numerous exhibitions of Danish art, and especially art representative of the Golden Age of Danish Painting. These include exhibitions in London (1907, 1948), Paris (1928, 1984–1985), New York City (1960–1961, 1964), and Rome (1974).\n\nHis works are in the collection of many Danish museums including the Danish National Gallery (\"Statens Museum for Kunst\"), the Hirschsprung Collection, the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen's City Museum, Thorvaldsens Museum, Ordrupgaard, and local art museums in Aarhus, Horsens, and Ribe.\n\nAnother Danish national romantic landscape painters of his generation, in addition to lifelong friend J.T. Lundbye, was Vilhelm Kyhn. \n\nThe Skovgaard Museum in Viborg is dedicated to the artistic production of the entire Skovgaard family. A number of paintings by P.C. Skovgaard are in the museum's collection.\n\nP.C. Skovgaard was the father of three artists: Joakim Skovgaard (1856–1933), Niels Skovgaard (1858–1938) and Suzette Holten (1863–1937).\n\n\n"}

Formerly, Wilhelm worked in the venture capital space and as a political campaign manager; most notably serving as Campaign Manager for the 1992 U.S. Presidential campaign of Bill Clinton, and later as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nHe was raised in Athens, Ohio, and has started many transformational projects and funds in the area. Wilhelm later settled in Chicago, Illinois, and now resides in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nHe received his B.A. from Ohio University, as well as a Master of Public Policy from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. He has received honorary doctorates from Ohio University, the University of Charleston, and Wheeling Jesuit University.\n\nWilhelm has taught or served as a fellow at Harvard, the University of Chicago, Ohio University, DePaul University, and the University of Akron.\n\nDavid Wilhelm was born on October 2, 1956, in Champaign, Illinois to Hubert and Constance Wilhelm, who were undergraduates at the University of Illinois at that time. Wilhelm is a first-generation American; his father is a native of Krauschwitz, Germany, and was brought to the United States as a high school aged refugee of war-torn Germany by a Brethren Church farm family living near Auburn, Illinois (about 20 miles south of Springfield). \nWilhelm's pre-school years consisted of brief family stays in Champaign, Illinois, Lafayette, Louisiana, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, while his father completed a PhD in Geography at Louisiana State University. Two sisters, Diana and Suzanne, were added to the mix and, in 1963, the Wilhelm family, now totaling five, moved to Athens, Ohio, where Wilhelm's father had accepted an offer to join the faculty of Ohio University, a position he held until his retirement 35 years later.\nWilhelm took to political organizing and strategy at a young age. In sixth grade, he led his fellow Safety Patrol workers on a strike over an unnecessary twenty minutes they were forced to stay in their posts long after the last student departing school had crossed the street. When he was twelve, he would conduct surveys of college students to determine whether Eugene McCarthy or Robert F. Kennedy had greater support. When he was sixteen, he helped manage the successful campaign of his social studies teacher, Peter Lalich, for a seat on Athens City Council.\n\nWilhelm attended Ohio University as a National Merit Scholar, graduating in August 1977, with a BA in Government. He was named the Outstanding Undergraduate in Government that year and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. While at Ohio University, Wilhelm continued political campaigning. At the age of 19, he was the first staffer hired by the then nascent Jimmy Carter presidential campaign in the State of Ohio. He was given the assignment of recruiting delegates and alternates in each of Ohio's congressional districts for the relatively unknown Georgia Governor. His work led to the filing of a complete slate of delegates and alternates, something that Carter's opponents failed, by and large, to match, providing the Carter campaign with a strong competitive advantage in Ohio.\n\nIn the fall of 1978, Wilhelm entered the two year Master of Public Policy program at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. During the following summer, he interned in the Office of Senator Howard Metzenbaum as an assistant to the senior legislative aide on budget and tax matters. During his time at the Kennedy School, he served as a teaching fellow for classes taught in public management by Professors Steven Kelman and Jonathan Brock.\n\nBefore moving to the private sector, Wilhelm ran political campaigns for candidates such as Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, and several Illinois-based Democrats, including Richard M. Daley and Paul Simon. He oversaw the day-to-day operations of the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign, directed its Electoral College and political strategy, and planned the post-convention bus tour of the American heartland.\n\nUpon his election in 1992, President Clinton nominated Wilhelm to serve as Chair of the Democratic National Committee, making Wilhelm the youngest person ever to serve in that role in either political party. As Chair, he re-established an advisory council of representatives from organized labor, and reached out to evangelical Christian voters, famously appearing before a convention of the Christian Coalition of America to a chorus of boos. Under Wilhelm's leadership, the DNC played a meaningful role in support of President Clinton's first budget proposal, which passed a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives by a single vote. But these organizational efforts were overshadowed by Clinton era controversies related to NAFTA, health care, and Congressional nervousness about the 1994 midterm elections.\n\nWilhelm served as Head of the Steering Committee for the City of Columbus' bid to host the 2016 Democratic National Convention, and is a lifetime superdelegate to the Democratic National Committee.\n\nIn 1995, Wilhelm returned to Chicago to build a successful career in business He and Kevin Conlon, a prominent labor lawyer and Democratic activist, started Wilhelm & Conlon Public Strategies (now Conlon Public Strategies) in 1998. A year later, Wilhelm moved into impact investing, founding Woodland Venture Management, and starting two venture capital funds that invest in businesses in economically challenged parts of Central Appalachia and the Great Lakes region.\n\nWilhelm's second fund, Hopewell Ventures, focused on the Midwest. Their portfolio includes National Pasteurized Eggs, a Lansing, Illinois-based company that produces whole, in-shell, pasteurized eggs under the Davidson's Safest Choice Eggs brand.\n\nWilhelm is a founder of a newly created Ohio Appalachian Business Council and in 2010 served as co-chair of a successful statewide campaign in support of the Ohio Third Frontier. He is co-chair of the advisory council for the Voinovich School for Leadership and Public Affairs at Ohio University.\n\nHe is also the founding Partner of Empower Gas & Electric, a Columbus, Ohio-based energy services company designed to help communities capture the economic benefit of their spending on electricity through local generation projects and the deployment of energy efficiency strategies.\n\nWilhelm previously served as a senior consultant to the Federal Co-Chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), Earl Gohl. This furthered Wilhelm's many efforts to promote entrepreneurship within the region and focuses on Appalachia's \"Emerging Opportunities\" for business growth and capital investment in energy, food, and health care as a pathway to a more diversified economy.\n\nDavid Wilhelm is a partner and the Chief Strategy Officer at Hecate Energy, a leading American-based developer of renewable energy projects. Hecate Energy is actively pursuing large scale solar and wind projects internationally, including countries such as Jordan, Tanzania, Kenya, and Pakistan.\n\nWilhelm is leading Hecate's efforts on the African continent, which include projects both large and small, both on-grid and off-grid. Hecate is working in Tanzania to install 100 MWs worth of solar power on the campus of Tanzania's largest university, the University of Dodoma.\n\nHecate Energy is one of the charter members of President Obama's \"Power Africa\" initiative, which was launched during his recent visit to Africa. There, President Obama announced plans to double access to power in sub-Saharan Africa, where about two thirds of the population has no electricity.\n\nWilhelm is Co-Chair of the Strategic Partners Group of the Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs at Ohio University and a co-founder of its Center for Public and Social Innovation.\n\nEarly in his career, Wilhelm was the executive director of one of the nation's leading tax reform organizations, Citizens for Tax Justice, and was a co-author of studies that provided impetus for federal tax reform during President Reagan's presidency.\n"}

According to this exemption, despite the patent rights, performing research and tests for preparing regulatory approval, for instance by the FDA in the United States, does not constitute infringement for a limited term before the end of patent term. This exemption allows generic manufacturers to prepare generic drugs in advance of the patent expiration.\n\nIn the United States, this exemption is also technically called § 271(e)(1) exemption or Hatch-Waxman exemption. In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court considered the scope of the Hatch-Waxman exemption in \"Merck v. Integra\". The Supreme Court held that the statute exempts from infringement \"all\" uses of compounds that are reasonably related to submission of information to the government under any law regulating the manufacture, use or distribution of drugs.\n\nIn Canada, this exemption is known as the Bolar provision or Roche-Bolar provision, named after the case \"Roche Products v. Bolar Pharmaceutical\".\n\nIn the European Union, equivalent exemptions are allowed under the terms of EC Directives 2001/82/EC (as amended by Directive 2004/28/EC) and 2001/83/EC (as amended by Directives 2002/98/EC, 2003/63/EC, 2004/24/EC and 2004/27/EC).\n\nThe common law research exemption is an affirmative defense to infringement where the alleged infringer is using a patented invention for research purposes. The doctrine originated in the 1813 decision by Justice Joseph Story appellate decision \"Whittemore v. Cutter\", 29 Fed. Cas. 1120 (C.C.D. Mass. 1813). Story famously wrote that the intent of the legislature could not have been to punish someone who infringes \"merely for [scientific] experiments, or for the purpose of ascertaining the sufficiency of the machine to produce its described effects.\" Subsequent decisions later distinguished between commercial and non-commercial research.\nIn 2002, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit dramatically limited the scope of the research exemption in \"Madey v. Duke University\", 307 F.3d 1351, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The court did not reject the defense, but left only a \"very narrow and strictly limited experimental use defense\" for \"amusement, to satisfy idle curiosity, or for strictly philosophical inquiry.\" The court also precludes the defense where, regardless of profit motive, the research was done \"in furtherance of the alleged infringer’s legitimate business.\" In the case of a research university like Duke University, the court held that the alleged use was in furtherance of its legitimate business - namely \"increas[ing] the status of the institution and lur[ing] lucrative research grants\", and thus the defense was inapplicable.\n\nIn \"Merck KGaA v. Integra Lifesciences I, Ltd.\", 545 U.S. 193 (2005), the United States Supreme Court held that the use of patented compounds in preclinical studies is protected under 35 U.S.C §271(e)(1) if there is a reasonable basis to believe that the compound tested could be the subject of an FDA submission and if the experiments will produce the types of information relevant to an Investigational New Drug or New Drug Application.\n\nIn cases where the Supreme Court has ruled narrowly (e.g., pharmaceutical drugs only) and a lower court has ruled more broadly, further litigation in the lower courts will often be necessary before a subsequent case will resolve the issue more generally as a matter of settled case law.\n\nThis type of exception is permitted by Article 30 of the WTO's TRIPs Agreement:\n\n"}

In the show, she is the daughter of Tagan, and was a leader of a village on the planet Athos. She had seen much of her family culled by the Wraith, although she (and some of her fellow Athosians) possessed the ability to \"sense\" the Wraith by means initially unknown.\n\nIn addition, she is skilled in military strategy, martial arts, and Pegasus-galaxy diplomacy, and displays knowledge of and proficiency with Earth technology; she practices a form of stick-fighting (based on Eskrima) with John Sheppard and has taken up use of Earth weapons (such as a P-90) with great facility.\n\nTeyla Emmagan is the leader of the Athosians, a human race of farmers, hunters, and traders from the planet Athos in the Pegasus Galaxy. She is the daughter of Tagan. The Athosians are the first natives of Pegasus whom the Atlantis Expedition encounters on their scouting of potential evacuation sites in \"Rising\". After a Wraith attack on Athos, Teyla and the Athosians settle in Atlantis. Friction in \"Suspicion\" causes the Athosians to leave Atlantis and settle on the mainland. Teyla stays with Sheppard's team, but later helps with evacuating the Athosians from the mainland several times in the face of various threats.\n\nIn season 1's \"The Gift\", Teyla and the Atlantis expedition learn that her ancestors were experimented on by a Wraith scientist, and that Teyla is one of the few Athosians who possess trace amounts of Wraith DNA which enable her to sense the Wraith through their telepathic network. Teyla uses this so-called \"gift\" in many ways throughout the series, both actively and passively, against the Wraith. She flies a Wraith hiveship in season 3's \"Misbegotten\"), and has immunity from hallucinatory signals sent out by a Wraith device in \"Phantoms\".\n\nIn spite of initial, distrustful attitudes towards her (mostly from military officials), Teyla is left in charge of Atlantis in the absence of the expedition's regular leadership. In the third season episode \"The Return\", Atlantis is reclaimed by a group of Ancients and the Athosians are asked to leave Lantea, settling on a planet they name New Athos, which is unknown to the Wraith. They remain on the planet after Earth regains control of Atlantis, and the Atlantis Expedition provides them with supplies and weapons. Though Teyla notes that she has often felt like an outsider among the Atlantis Earth crew, the rescue of fellow reconnaissance teammate Ronon Dex convinces her of the team's loyalty to one another.\n\nSeason 3's \"Sunday\" reveals that Teyla has a romantic interest in an unnamed male, who is presumably unaware of her feelings. In season 4, however, Teyla discovers that she is pregnant at the end of \"Missing\". The child's father is an Athosian named Kanaan. When Teyla is three months pregnant in \"Be All My Sins Remember'd\", Sheppard suspends her from active duty. In the meantime, the Athosian people have gone missing, and the search for clues to their disappearance proves a season-long arc for Teyla. Michael and his genetic experiments to create Wraith/Human Hybrids are found out to be responsible for the Athosian's disappearance near the end of season 4. At the beginning of season 5, Teyla gives birth to a son, whom she names Torren John after her father and Sheppard. (When fans pointed out that Teyla had introduced herself as \"daughter of Tagan\" in \"Rising\", implying her father's name as Tagan, executive producer Joseph Mallozzi suggested that Teyla may have been referring to her mother.)\n\nTeyla has many Athosian character traits. She also has the ability to sense Wraith and control them. Although many of the Athosians possess martial skills, they do not consider themselves warriors. The Athosians are widely travelled in Pegasus and are trading partners with many worlds; their extensive knowledge of the Pegasus galaxy has availed the Expedition on several occasions. A spiritual people, the Athosians venerate the Ancestors (better known as the Ancients), and dedicate prayers to them. They also hold Atlantis sacred, and many object when they learn that the Expedition plans to destroy Atlantis rather than let it fall to the Wraith. Due to the constant threat of Wraith attack, Athosians consider it a privilege to know when and where one is about to die, and have a ritual prayer for the occasion meant to prepare that person for death. In Athosian culture, a woman is not expected to express her attraction to someone before the man does.\n\nIn the original script, Teyla was called Mikala. Kira Clavell originally auditioned for the role of Teyla, but although she caught the eye of the producers, she was not \"quite right for Teyla\" and was given the role of Amaterasu in the \"SG-1\" two-parter \"New Order\" instead. Teyla's pregnancy in season 4 was the result of Luttrell's real-life pregnancy.\n\n"}

After the war, she became one of Germany's leading journalists and intellectuals, working for over 55 years as an editor and later publisher of the Hamburg-based weekly newspaper \"Die Zeit\".\n\nDönhoff was born in East Prussia in 1909 into the old aristocratic Dönhoff family at Schloss Friedrichstein (now in the Gurkyevsky District of the Russian oblast of Kaliningrad). Her father was Count August von Dönhoff, a diplomat and member of the Prussian House of Lords and the German Parliament. As a diplomat, he was located in Washington for some time, and became a close friend of Senator Carl Schurz. Dönhoff discusses in her memoirs her father's involvement in one of the last episodes of the Indian wars, the White River War.\n\nHer mother was born Maria von Lepel (1869–1940). Marion studied economics at Frankfurt, where National Socialist sympathizers were said to have called her the \"red countess\" for her defiance once they gained power in 1933. She left Germany soon after, moving to Basel, Switzerland, where she earned her doctorate. But she later returned to her family home at Quittainen in 1938, and joined the resistance movement, which led to questioning by the Gestapo after a failed assassination attempt on Hitler in 1944. Although many of her fellow resistance activists were executed, she was released reportedly because her name was not found in any of the documents seized by the Nazis.\n\nIn January 1945, as Soviet troops rolled into the region, Dönhoff fled East Prussia, travelling seven weeks on horseback before reaching Hamburg. She recounted her journey in a 1962 book of essays called \"Names No One Mentions Anymore\". The castle in which she grew up is within the borders of what is now part of Russia (Kaliningrad oblast), yet she was one of the first public figures to endorse the finality of the border between Germany and Poland, which had been established after the Second World War.\n\nIn 1946, Dönhoff joined the fledgling, Hamburg-based, intellectual weekly \"Die Zeit\" as political editor. In August 1954, she temporarily left the newspaper in protest against articles by Richard Tüngel, who had published, inter alia, a text of Nazi constitutional lawyer Carl Schmitt and went to London to work for \"The Observer\". Soon afterwards, however, she returned to Hamburg, and was promoted to deputy editor-in-chief in 1955, then editor-in-chief in 1968, and publisher in 1972. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990.\n\nShe was involved in helping refugees settle in West Germany from East Germany and other parts of Europe.\n\nAt the time of her death on 11 March 2002, aged 92, Dönhoff was still co-publisher of the influential newspaper. She was the author of more than twenty books, including political and historical analyses of Germany as well as commentary on U.S. foreign policy. Among many international distinctions, Dönhoff was awarded honorary doctorates by Columbia University and Georgetown University.\n\nEnglish\n\nGerman\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2056989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056989", "title": "Felo de se", "text": "Felo de se\n\nFelo de se, Latin for \"felon of himself\", is an archaic legal term that denotes an illegal act of suicide.\nEarly English common law considered suicide a crime and a person found guilty of it, even though dead, was subject to punishments including forfeiture of property to the monarch and being given a shameful burial. Beginning in the seventeenth century law and custom gradually changed to consider a person who committed suicide to be temporarily insane at the time and conviction and punishment were gradually phased out.\nThe term and punishments could also apply to a person killed while committing a felony.\n\nIn early English common law, adults who killed themselves were literally felons, and the crime was punishable by forfeiture of property to the king and what was considered a shameful burial – typically with a stake through the heart and with a burial at a crossroad. Burials for \"felo de se\" typically took place at night, with no mourners or clergy present, and the location was often kept a secret by the authorities. A child or mentally incompetent person, however, who killed himself was not considered a \"felo de se\" and was not punished post-mortem for his actions.\n\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in England, as suicides came to be seen more and more as an act of temporary insanity, many coroner's juries began declaring more suicide victims as \"non compos mentis\" rather than \"felo de se\". This meant that the perpetrator's property was not forfeited to the crown and the family could inherit the property. MacDonald and Murphy write that \"By the 1710s and 1720s, over 90 per cent of all suicides were judged insane, and after a period of more rigorous enforcement of the law, \"non compos mentis\" became in the last three decades of the century the only suicide verdict that Norwich Coroners returned. ... \"Non compos mentis\" had become the usual verdict in cases of suicide by the last third of the century.\"\n\nThe method of interment in a public highway with a stake driven through the body persisted until 1823, when the Burial of Suicide Act 1823 (4 Geo. IV, c. 52) abolished the practice, and provided that the remains should be buried in a churchyard (with the Minister in attendance), or other authorised place. Some elements of the old practice did persist, however, into at least the middle of the nineteenth century. A news report in 1866 concerning the suicide of Eli Sykes, a prisoner awaiting the death sentence at Armley gaol in Leeds, stated that the inquest jury returned a verdict of \"felo de se\" and \"in consequence of that verdict the body would be buried at midnight, without any religious ceremony, within the precincts of the gaol\". In the Burial Laws Amendment Act 1880, provision was made for the provision of funeral rites to be performed described as \"Christian and orderly religious service\", replacing that taken from the Book of Common Prayer, if required.\n\n\"Felo de se\" is also employed as the title of poems by \"fin de siècle\" poet Amy Levy and Georgian poet Richard Hughes. It is also the title of a book by R. Austin Freeman.\n\nThe laws relating to \"felo de se\" also applied to someone who was killed or died by other causes whilst committing another felony (e.g., a burglar who was killed by a householder defending his own property). \n\nIn England and Wales, the offence of \"felo de se\" was abolished by section 1 of the Suicide Act 1961.\n\nRestrictions on the burial of persons found \"felo de\" se had previously been relaxed by the Burial of Suicide Act 1823 (4 Geo 4 c 52) and by the Interments (felo de se) Act 1882.\n\nIn 2017, the Indian Parliament passed a mental healthcare bill that (among other things) decriminalized attempts to suicide.\n\nIn the 1700s, the English colonies in what is now the United States decriminalized suicide. Following the example set by the United Kingdom, state laws against suicide were gradually repealed. By the 1990s only two states prohibited suicide.\n\n\n"}

It is a solid and single coloured version of indigenous hound dog of Tamil Nadu; today it is found in the area around Periyar Lake, while black and tan and black and sable versions are called Kanni. It is used primarily for hunting small rabbits, forest pig, and deer, but after the hunting regulation act passed by the Indian government, now they are being used for dog racing and show breed. Even so, these dogs are used for catching rabbits in small villages near forest and mountain in south India. They are also used for guarding the home. Bred by royal families in Chippiparai, Virudhunagar district Tamil Nadu, it was kept as a symbol of royalty and dignity mostly in Tirunelveli, Thenkasi, Kagzhu Malai and Madurai. It is also known for its speed and loyalty to owners.\n\nThe typical colors are fawn, black, reddish brown, black tinged coat, silver-grey, with very limited or no white markings and long curved tail. Other colors, particularly variations of grey and fawn also occur. This is a medium dog, around 25 inches or 63.5 cm at the withers., in a recent study males averaged approximately 63.0 cm and females approximately 56.0 cm at the withers. It has a short coat that is very close; on the whole the coat if kept groomed has a shine on it. A shining, shell-like appearance is greatly desired. This kind of coat makes it ideal for hot climates. This hound is also less prone to ticks and fleas, with their short coat providing easy detection. The overall appearance is very similar to that of the Sloughi, or the Rampur Greyhound.\n\nThe Chippiparai is a robust animal needing little or no veterinary care. It is active during young stages. It does need lots of exercise, as it was and is meant to hunt. Chippiparai is an intelligent breed and a wonderful watch dog. Contrary to the belief that it is a one-man dog, the Chippiparai gets along well with people other than its owner if it is properly socialized. Chippiparais love human companionship and are averse to being in isolation. They are capable of great speed and can overtake a hare with ease.\n\nThe Chippiparai is not a fussy eater. It is easy to groom and does not shed much due to its short coat length.\n\nGenerally the breed is healthy. Though sturdy enough to cope with limited means and harsh weather conditions, the breed does suffer from cold weather. They have certain general health issues such as sensitivity to anesthesia and food allergies.\n\nThe breed is rare in dog show circles. However, there are multiple recent campaigns by breeders based at southern districts of Tamil Nadu to increase the awareness about this breed. These campaigns are showing progress and there is an increased interest amongst people living in rural areas with large open farms. Besides other Native dogs Chippiparai take place at Kolkata also.\n\n"}

Also often sung is Mechem's choral arrangement of the song \"The Lighthearted Lovers,\" excerpted from Dorine's aria, \"Fair Robin I Love.\"\n\n\nMadame Pernelle, together with her maid, Flipote, is leaving the house of her son, Orgon. She berates the rest of the household for not living up to the standards of \"that holy man\" Tartuffe, whom Orgon has befriended. Elmire, Orgon's second wife, vainly attempts to make peace. Orgon's daughter, Mariane, supported by her brother, Damis, enlists Elmire's help in holding Orgon to his promise that Mariane may wed Valère.\n\nUpon Orgon's return home, the maid Dorine tries to tell him that his wife has been ill, but Orgon asks only about Tartuffe. When Elmire questions Orgon about his promise to Mariane, he evades her, and indeed tells Mariane that she must marry Tartuffe. At this, the eavesdropping Dorine bursts into laughter, pretending that Orgon must be joking. She ridicules Tartuffe and so saucily interrupts Orgon that he storms out.\n\nDorine encourages Mariane to resist her father. But now Valère arrives, having heard a rumor of Mariane's betrothal. Both lovers are too proud to admit their dependence upon one another, and they become locked into a furious quarrel. Eventually Dorine reconciles them, and they plot a scheme to outwit Orgon and get rid of Tartuffe.\n\nDorine has arranged a meeting between Tartuffe and Elmire. Damis insists upon hiding to observe them. Tartuffe arrives with a great show of sanctity, and even manages to use this as a perverted justification of his love for Elmire. She reproaches him for his advances, but promises not to tell her husband if Tartuffe will persuade Orgon to permit Mariane to wed Valère. Damis springs out of his hiding place, swearing to reveal Tartuffe's duplicity, despite Elmire's desire only to right the wrong and avoid a scandal. Orgon arrives, and Damis denounces Tartuffe, but the hypocrite so cunningly chastises himself that Orgon blindly accuses his son of stigmatizing him, and orders Damis from the house. Now sure of his position, Tartuffe manipulates Orgon into deeding his house and goods over to him.\n\nScene 1: Elmire at last persuades Orgon to witness Tartuffe's treachery with his own eyes. Orgon is to hide under a table, and come out when Elmire signals by coughing. The wary villain enters. Elmire professes great feeling for him, and Tartuffe demands to \"savor some tender favor\" as proof, freely admitting his lust for her. In spite of Elmire's frantic coughing, Orgon does not emerge until Tartuffe begins to speak contemptuously of him. The game is up, but Tartuffe merely shakes the deed of gift at Orgon and goes out, threatening that \"It's you, not I, who has to leave!\"\n\nScene 2: Madame Pernelle returns to defend Tartuffe against these latest slanders. Her opinion changes, however, when Tartuffe himself appears to oust Orgon, accompanied by an obsequious court bailiff. Orgon refuses to go, and Tartuffe leaves to call the police. The \"bailiff\" reveals himself as Damis in disguise, and he is quickly followed by Valère in disguise as a police officer, and Mariane as a special envoy of the King, who has been sent in order to arrest Tartuffe! The \"royal envoy\" enumerates Tartuffe's crimes, and orders him to leave the country or be jailed. Tartuffe flees, and Orgon, confessing his foolishness, presents Mariane to Valère amid general rejoicing.<br>\nExcerpt from Tartuffe Score.\n\n\n"}

His many careers included schoolmaster, journalist, policeman, disc-jockey, actor, interviewer and television presenter. He also appeared in several films, sometimes in character parts but usually as himself – for example in \"Expresso Bongo\", 1959. \n\nHarding had a sizeable role alongside John Mills in the 1952 film \"The Gentle Gunman\" and narrated the introduction to the film \"Pacific Destiny\", 1956. He also made a couple of comedy records in the 1950s.\n\nGilbert Charles Harding was born in Hereford where his parents were employed as \"master\" and \"matron\" of the city's workhouse. \n\nHarding's education continued at Queens' College, Cambridge, after which he took jobs teaching English in Canada and France. He returned to Britain and worked as a policeman in Bradford, before taking a position as \"The Times\" correspondent in Cyprus. In 1936 he again returned to Britain and began a long-term career with the BBC.\n\nHe was a regular on BBC Radio's Twenty Questions and was voted Personality of the Year in the National Radio Awards of 1953-4. Harding regularly appeared on the BBC television panel game \"What's My Line?\" as a panellist, having been the presenter of the very first episode in 1951.\n\nHarding was notorious for his irascibility and was at one time characterised in the tabloid press as \"the rudest man in Britain\". His fame sprang from an inability to suffer fools gladly, and many 1950s TV viewers watched \"What's My Line?\" less for the quiz elements than for the chance of a live Harding outburst. An incident on an early broadcast started this trend when Harding became annoyed with a contestant and told the contestant that he was getting bored with him. Harding's rudeness off screen was also commented upon; at a wedding reception at which a guest remarked that the bride and groom would make an ideal couple. Harding replied \"You should know, you've slept with both of them\". He became increasingly unable to move anywhere in public without being accosted by adoring viewers. On one occasion he asked a mother with two children if \"your children are crippled\", because they had stayed seated on a railway bench.\n\nIn 1960 he was reduced to tears on an edition of the \"Face to Face\" series, after being questioned by the host John Freeman. As the focus of the interview moved on to the subject of death, Freeman asked Harding if he had ever been in the presence of a dead person. At this point, in replying in the affirmative, Harding's voice began to break and his eyes watered. Freeman later said he had not anticipated the effect this would have; Harding had witnessed his mother's death in 1954. Freeman appeared to be unaware that Harding was referring to his mother since later in the interview he asserted that Harding's mother was still alive. Harding contradicted him and Freeman moved quickly on. This version of events has been contradicted by the producer, Hugh Burnett.\n\nFreeman publicly expressed regret about this line of questioning; its emphasis on Harding's \"closeness\" to his mother has since been seen by at least one commentator as a tactless attempt to expose his homosexuality, though the viewing public did not become aware of it, and he was seen as merely a lonely bachelor. Harding kept his sexuality secret because male homosexual behaviour was a criminal offence in the UK. Harding also admitted in the programme that his bad manners and temper were \"indefensible\". \"[I'm] profoundly lonely,\" he stated, later adding, \"I would very much like to be dead.\"\n\nHarding died a few weeks after the 'Face to Face' programme was broadcast, collapsing outside Broadcasting House as he was about to climb into a taxi. The cause was an asthma attack. He was 53 years old.\n\nHarding was buried in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green, west London.\n\nBehind Harding's gruff exterior there was a lonely and complex man who constantly donated to charity, visited the sick and helped many in need. But such details, in conflict with the public image, became public only after his death. In 1979 radio presenter Owen Spencer-Thomas on BBC Radio London's \"Gilbert Harding\" described him as \"enigmatic ... bad-tempered and rude, yet his friends counted him as one of the kindest, and most generous.\"\n\nThe \"Face to Face\" interview was rebroadcast on BBC Four on 18 October 2005, following a repeated episode of \"What's My Line?\". It was also broadcast in part on the BBC Four series 'Talk at the BBC.' A three-hour programme \"The Rudest Man in Britain\" was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2014 and has been repeated several times. \n\nIt included interviews with people who knew and worked with him and explored Harding's life, personality, sexuality and influence in a non-judgemental way. It included the \"Face to Face\" interview in full as well as episodes of programmes where Gilbert was either Chairman or panel member. It ended with Stephen Wyatt's play \"Dr Brighton and Mr Harding\".\n\n\n\n"}

It started in 1937 and was abandoned in 1949. It was picked back up in 1966 by CWF and lasted until 1987 when the company was purchased by Jim Crockett Promotions. In 1988, the newly created Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), soon renamed Pro Wrestling Federation (PWF), picked it back up in 1988 and it continued its lineage through NWA Florida, until they ceased operations in 2006. In 2009, Pro Wrestling Fusion revived the title until they left the NWA in 2011. For several months in 2012, a new Championship Wrestling from Florida affiliated with the NWA, briefly reviving the title until NWA Florida Underground Wrestling took over the championship.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2057073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057073", "title": "Metric mile", "text": "Metric mile\n\nA metric mile is a colloquial term used in some countries for the 1500 meters, the premier middle distance running event in international track and field. The term 'metric mile' was applied to this distance because it approximates one statute mile (1609.344 m). The term is most commonly used in track running, speed skating and swimming.\n\nIn track running, the 1500 m race became the standard middle distance race in Europe in the late 19th century, and has been the standard distance in the Olympic Games since 1896. \n\nPrior to metrication, many tracks in the United States and the Commonwealth of Nations were constructed to the specifications of one quarter of a mile, 440 yards (402.336 m). Thus when the mile was run, the race was a four lap race. The Commonwealth Games officially converted to metric in the mid-1960s. The United States adopted metric rules in the mid to late 1970s, though some tracks are still constructed to be a quarter of a mile in length requiring calibrated painted lines to run metric races.\n\nEven in countries like the U.S. which do not embrace the metric system, most running tracks now have a lap distance of 400 metres in the innermost lane. The final leg of a distance medley relay uses a four lap 1600 m leg; The standard middle distance in many United States high school competitions is 1600 m and this distance is sometimes referred to as a metric mile as well.\n\nIn swimming, the race is commonly referred to as \"the swimmer's mile\", and is often the longest distance swum by competitors in a pool. The standard distance triathlon also employs the swimmer's mile, except in open water instead of a pool.\n\n"}

It was the second of three battles in the Trail of Blood on Ice campaign for the control of Indian Territory during the American Civil War.\n\nA series of battles were fought in December in bad weather between the Confederate Cherokee and Choctaw Indians and the Union Creek and Seminole Indians (led by the Muscogee Creek chief Opothleyahola) who supported the Federal government. Following Opothleyahola and his Union force’s defeat at Round Mountain, he retreated northeastward in search of safety. On December 9, 1861, the force was at \"Chusto-Talasah\" (Caving Banks) on the Horseshoe Bend of Bird Creek when Col. Douglas H. Cooper’s 1,300 Confederates attacked about 2:00 p.m. Chief Opothleyahola knew Cooper was coming and had placed his troops in a strong position in heavy timber at Horseshoe Bend.\n\nFor almost four hours, Cooper attacked and attempted to outflank the Federals, finally driving them across Bird Creek just before dark. Cooper camped there overnight but did not pursue the Federals because he was short of ammunition. The Confederates claimed victory, although some sources credit Opothleyahola's forces with driving off the attackers. In any event, Chief Opothleyahola and his band moved on in search of security elsewhere. Their loss was estimated by Cooper as 500 (some accounts suggest 412). Confederate casualties were 15 killed and 37 wounded.\n\nRegardless of whether the Confederates had gained a minor tactical victory here, they would win a resounding one later in the month at Chustenahlah.\n\nThe Chusto-Talasah battle site is on privately owned land near 86th Street North and Delaware Avenue, 5 miles northwest of modern Tulsa. A granite marker on the east side of Sperry, Oklahoma places the battlesite 9 miles N.E.S.E. of that point.\n\n\"Cooper's Brigade\" - Col. Douglas H.
