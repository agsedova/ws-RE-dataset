{"id": "2048925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048925", "title": "Othello (1951 film)", "text": "Othello (1951 film)\n\nOthello (also known as The Tragedy of Othello: The Moor of Venice) is a 1951 tragedy film directed and produced by Orson Welles, who also adapted the Shakespearean play and played the title role. Recipient of the \"Grand Prix du Festival International du Film\" (precursory name for the \"Palme d'Or\") at the 1952 Cannes Film Festival, the film was distributed by United Artists when it was released in the United States in 1955. \"Othello\" was filmed on location over a three-year period in Morocco, Venice, Tuscany and Rome and at the Scalera Studios in Rome.\n\nIn addition to Orson Welles, the cast consisted of Micheál MacLiammóir as Iago, Robert Coote as Roderigo, Suzanne Cloutier as Desdemona, Michael Laurence as Cassio, Fay Compton as Emilia and Doris Dowling as Bianca. Three versions of the film have seen theatrical release — two supervised by Welles, and a 1992 restoration supervised by his daughter, Beatrice Welles.\n\nWelles trimmed the source material, which is generally around three hours when performed, down to a little over 90 minutes for the film.\nOne of Welles' more complicated shoots, \"Othello\" was filmed erratically over three years. Shooting began in 1949, but was forced to shut down when the film's original Italian producer announced on one of the first days of shooting that he was bankrupt. Instead of abandoning filming altogether, Welles as director began pouring his own money into the project. When he ran out of money as well, he needed to stop filming for months at a time to raise money, mostly by taking part in other productions. Because of lack of funds, production was stopped at least three times. The film found some imaginative solutions to a range of logistical problems; the scene in which Roderigo is murdered in a Turkish bath was shot in that form because the original costumes were impounded and using replacements would have meant a delay. One of the fight scenes starts in Morocco, but the ending was shot in Rome several months later. Welles used the money from his acting roles, such as in \"The Third Man\" (1949), to help finance the film, but this often involved pausing filming for several months while he went off to raise money; and these pauses were further complicated by the shifting availability of different actors, which meant that some key parts (like Desdemona) had to be recast, and whole scenes then reshot. This lengthy shoot is detailed in Micheál MacLiammóir's book \"Put Money in Thy Purse.\"\n\nWhen Welles acted in the 1950 film \"The Black Rose\", he insisted that the coat his character, Bayan, wore be lined with mink, even though it would not be visible. Despite the expense, the producers agreed to his request. At the end of filming, the coat disappeared, but could subsequently be seen in \"Othello\" with the fur lining exposed.\n\nWelles was reportedly extremely satisfied with the film's musical score by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino, and Lavagnino again provided the musical scores of Welles' two subsequent Shakespearean films, \"Chimes at Midnight\" (1965) and \"The Merchant of Venice\" (1969).\n\n\nA dubbed version of \"Othello\" premiered in Rome, Italy on 29 November 1951. Welles' original English-language version premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 10 May 1952, and went on general release in Europe. Unlike that of the subsequent American cut, the soundtrack was generally without flaws, apart from some dubbing that was slightly out of sync. It features different edits of many scenes from the other two versions, with alternate camera angles used. A print remains stored in the Paris Cinematheque.\n\nWelles supervised a different version of \"Othello\" for the American market, a 93-minute cut released on 12 September 1955 in New York City. This had a number of minor editing and several major soundtrack changes, including Welles' replacement of his spoken-word titles with written credits (requested by the film's distributor, United Artists) and the addition of a narration by Welles. Suzanne Cloutier's entire performance was dubbed by Gudrun Ure, who had previously played Desdemona opposite Welles in a 1951 theatre production of \"Othello\" that was staged to raise funds to complete the film. Paul Squitieri, in a 1993 PhD study of the film in its various forms, argues that the U.S. version represents a \"compromise\", with some of the changes forced on Welles, and that the original European cut represents the truest version. A Criterion LaserDisc of this version came out in 1994, but was withdrawn from sale after legal action by Welles' daughter, Beatrice Welles.\n\nWelles featured \"Othello\" clips in his 1978 \"making of\" movie, \"Filming Othello\", but in fact these had all been completely reedited by him for the documentary, and so do not appear in the original film in the same form. The clips were all accompanied by a voice-over from Welles, so that no part of the original soundtrack was heard in \"Filming Othello\".\n\nReleased in Europe to acclaim in 1952, \"Othello\" won the \"Grand Prix du Festival International du Film\" at the Cannes Film Festival under the Moroccan flag. Welles could not find the film a distributor in the United States for over three years, and even after its U.S. release it was largely ignored. The film was re-released to theaters in a 1992 restoration that screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival and was shown to acclaim in the United States. The film has a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 32 reviews with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"This ragged take on Othello may take liberties with the source material, but Orson Welles's genius never fails to impress.\"\n\nIn 1992, Beatrice Welles-Smith, daughter of Orson Welles, supervised the restoration of the film, which saw over $1 million spent on improving the picture quality, re-synching the audio, adding extra sound effects, and completely re-recording the music in stereo. Although the restoration was greeted with positive reviews upon its release, it subsequently came under attack for numerous technical flaws and alterations. Further alterations were made between the restoration's theatrical release and its home media release, after complaints that the opening scene lacked the Gregorian chanting it had previously had, and another scene was missing entirely. This is the only version which has been available on VHS and DVD since the mid-1990s, since legal action by Beatrice Welles has blocked either version released by Orson Welles from being sold. This version runs to 91 minutes.\n\nMultiple film historians criticized the restoration work. Jonathan Rosenbaum argued that numerous changes were made against Welles' intent and that the restoration was incompetent, having used as its source an original distribution print with a flawed soundtrack. In fact, the visual elements of the 1992 restoration utilized a fine-grain master positive—discovered in a storage in New Jersey—as its source, not a distribution print. The audio came from a distribution print that was re-synchronized, virtually syllable-by-syllable by the restoration team to match the master positive. As some voice parts had music underneath, the newly recorded music and effects track had to match whatever music was underneath the dialogue, leading to inconsistencies. The flaw in the American cut's soundtrack is how white noise is audible in the background throughout dialogue and music, but that the noise cuts out when there is no action—meaning the white noise is more noticeable whenever it returns. The restoration sought to minimize this problem, but it is still present in places. By contrast, the white noise problem is not present to begin with in Welles' original 1952 European cut.\n\nRosenbaum makes several charges of incompetence on the restoration team's part, including that the restoration team were unaware of the European cut's existence, and instead based their work on the American cut which was farther from Welles' original vision. The team recut the order of entire scenes to make the dialogue match. One scene was inexplicably missing from the cinema release, but restored for the video/DVD release. The opening scene, in cinema release, was lacking the important Gregorian chanting, but this was restored for the DVD. The soundtrack attracted particular criticism. Instead of consulting the papers of composer Angelo Francesco Lavagnino, where a full copy of the score survives, the restorers instead chose to transcribe the music from the poor-quality audio of the print they had, with numerous mistakes having been made — Lavagnino's son has gone so far as to argue the new score is so different it is no longer his father's work. The new score was also recorded with arguably less impressive resources than the original version—although Welles only used a single microphone for a monaural soundtrack, he had forty mandolins playing in his version, while the new stereo soundtrack used three. Further, Rosenbaum states that by refusing to give permission for her father's version to be shown or released, Beatrice Welles \"effectively made her father’s version of the film (as well as, more indirectly, his final feature, \"Filming Othello\") illegal, so that she can make more money on her own version\", since she only receives royalties on the version which she restored. Many of these criticisms have been subsequently echoed by other scholars such as David Impastato and Michael Anderegg.\n\nAnderegg particularly criticizes the bold claims made by the restorers at the time of the film's 1992 release, including Beatrice Welles' statements \"This is a film that no one has seen\", that it was a \"lost film\", and that it was \"never given a theatrical release\" (all of which are untrue), and he dismisses as hyperbolic the judgment of film restorer Michael Dawson that Welles' original dubbing was like \"Japanese sci-fi.\" Instead, Anderegg argues that \"Othello\" was simply seldom screened. Jonathan Rosenbaum has defended the out-of-sync dubbing of some lines in Welles' original version, pointing out it was typical of European films of the early 1950s, and likening modern attempts to resynchronise it to the proposed colorisation of \"Citizen Kane\".\n\nIn 2014 Carlotta Films US released a 2K digital restoration of the 1992 version on DCP. This digital version premiered in Dallas at the 2014 USA Film Festival, and subsequently played in other cities on the art-house circuit. \"The New Yorker\" reported that the monaural soundtrack was a great improvement on the previous version of the restoration — \"much more appropriate for a low-budget, black-and-white 1952 release.\"\n\nOn September 26, 2017, The Criterion Collection released both the European and 1955 US versions of \"Othello\" on Blu-ray and DVD. Special features include the short film \"Return to Glennascaul\" (1951); audio commentary by Peter Bogdanovich and Myron Meisel; and interviews with Simon Callow, Joseph McBride, François Thomas and Ayanna Thompson.\n\n\n"}

There were 5,569 people enrolled within the electorate as of August 2016.\n\nLike most electorates in the Territory, Wanguri has a tendency to keep its incumbent members regardless of party. While the Country Liberal Party held it for six years after its creation in 1983, the Labor Party have held it since a 1989 by-election, and it is now reckoned as reasonably safe for that party. Paul Henderson was not expected to have much difficulty retaining Wanguri at the 2005 election, and ultimately held the seat with a strong swing in his favour.\n\nWhen Henderson resigned in 2013, following his government's defeat in the 2012 election, the resulting by-election saw Nicole Manison hold the seat for Labor. Manison managed to pick up a 12.4 percent swing—according to ABC election analyst Antony Green, the largest against a first term government in Australia in over twenty years. It was enough to revert Wanguri to its traditional status as a comfortably safe Labor seat. Manison consolidated her hold on the seat in the 2016 election, increasing her majority to 19.6 percent.

{"id": "2048999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2048999", "title": "French Community", "text": "French Community\n\nThe French Community () was an association of former French colonies, mostly from Africa. In 1958 it replaced the French Union, which had itself succeeded the French colonial empire in 1946.\n\nThe Community had a short lifespan because, while the Africans did not refuse it, they refrained from giving it real life. Under the appearance of equality, the constitution of the Community restricted the sovereignty of the twelve new African states, and reaffirmed the preeminence of France, by placing in the \"domaine commun\" fundamental sectors — such as foreign affairs, defence, the currency, economic policies and control of raw materials — all sectors that a genuine state wishes to control.\n\nThe constitution of the Fifth Republic, which created the French Community, was a consequence of the war in Algeria. Under the 1946 French Union there was said to be no French colonies, but metropolitan France, the overseas departments, and the overseas territories would instead constitute a single French Union, or just one France. In reality, the colonies had little power, with all power remaining centralized in the French Parliament.\n\nOn January 31, 1956, an enabling law changed the system, abandoning assimilation in favor of autonomy, to allow territories to develop their own local government and eventually gain their independence. This was an attempt to quell the concerns over Algerian independence. However, this did not stop the demands for independence. The 1 million French colonists in Algeria were determined to resist any possible Algerian independence, and they made massive demonstrations in Algiers on 13 May 1958. The trouble, which threatened to become a civil war, provoked a political crisis in France and caused the end of the Fourth Republic. General Charles de Gaulle was recalled to power and a new constitution was written. Initially De Gaulle seemed to confirm the Algerian settlers' hopes that he would help them, ending a speech to them with the cry \"Vive l'Algérie française !\", but privately he indicated that he did not have any intention of maintaining control of 9 million Algerians for the benefit of one million settlers. This attitude was manifest in the new constitution, which provided for the right of the overseas territories to request complete independence.\n\nOn 28 September 1958 a referendum was held throughout the French Union and the new constitution was approved, by universal suffrage, in all of the territories except French Guinea, which voted instead for the option of complete independence. Under this new constitution, the French Union was replaced by the French Community and France was now a federation of states with their own self-government.\n\nThe territorial assemblies of the remaining overseas territories were then allowed four months, dating from the promulgation of the constitution, i.e. until 4 February 1959, to select one of the following options in accordance with articles 76 and 91 of the constitution:\n\nOnly Gabon sought to become an overseas department, but was dissuaded from doing so by the French government. The overseas territories of the Comoro Islands, French Polynesia, French Somaliland, New Caledonia, and St Pierre and Miquelon opted to maintain their status, while Chad, French Dahomey, French Sudan, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mauritania, Middle Congo, Niger, Senegal, Ubangi-Shari, and Upper Volta chose to become states of the French Community, some of them changing their names in the process.\n\nBy early 1959, the members of the French Community were as follows:\n\nAlthough there was only one \"citizenship of the Community\", the territories that became Community member states did not form part of the French Republic, and were granted broad autonomy. They had their own constitutions and could create unions among themselves. The Community's jurisdiction as a whole was limited to foreign policy, defence, the currency, a common economic and financial policy and policy on strategic matters and, except for special agreements, control of justice, higher education, external and public transport and telecommunications. Agreements of Association could also be made by the Community with other states.\n\nAssociated with the Community were the United Nations trust territories of French Cameroun and French Togoland, and the Anglo-French condominium of the New Hebrides.\n\nArticle 91 of the constitution stipulated that the institutions of the Community were to be established by 4 April 1959.\nThese were as follows:\n\nThe President of the Community was the President of the French Republic. The member states also participated with his election and he was represented in each state by a High Commissioner. During 1958 President de Gaulle was elected by an absolute majority in all the states. To promote autonomy within France, Gaulle gave autonomy to the colonies so that they would stay within the community.\n\nThe Executive Council of the Community met several times a year, in one or other of the capitals, on the summons of the President, who assumed direction of the meeting. It was composed of the chiefs of the governments of the different states and the ministers responsible for common affairs.\n\nThe Senate of the Community was composed of members of the local assemblies designated by them in numbers proportional to the population of the state. This body was functionally powerless, and after holding two sessions it was abolished during March 1961.\n\nA Community Court of Arbitration, composed of seven judges nominated by the President, gave decisions in disputes between member states.\n\nBecause France did not want to become 'a colony of its colonies', African countries did not compose a majority voting bloc and were required functionally to join with French parties in order to gain voting power.\n\nThe Communauté initially assumed close cooperation between member states and the French government. The French government was responsible for security and to some degree policing in all states. A number of African presidents were present—symbolizing, for continental anti-colonialists, their complicity—at \"Gerboise Bleue\", France's first nuclear test, which occurred on 4 February 1960 near Reggane in the Sahara Desert of central Algeria.\n\nAmong the states, the Community as assumed originally functioned only during 1959 when six sessions of the executive council were held in various capitals. Immediately after the sixth session, held in Dakar during December, President de Gaulle agreed to Mali's claim for national sovereignty, thus beginning the process of all of the states being granted independence during 1960. On 4 June 1960, articles 85 and 86 were amended by Constitutional Act No. 60-525, allowing the member states to become fully independent, either still as members of the Community or not. This amendment also allowed for a state that was already fully independent to join the Community without losing its independence.\nBy 1961, only the Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Gabon, the Malagasy Republic and Senegal still belonged to the Community. The constitutional bodies no longer continued to function and the term 'president of the community' disappeared from official statements. It seemed that the only remaining differences between those states that were members of the community, and those that had left it, was the fact that the diplomatic representatives in Paris of the former had the title \"high commissioner\", and those of the latter 'ambassador'. Moreover, the second title tended to be used in all cases without distinction.\n\nAlthough the French Community had almost ceased to exist as an institution by the early 1960s, the remaining members never formally withdrew and the relevant articles were not eliminated from the French Constitution until they were finally abrogated by Constitutional Act number 95-880 of 4 August 1995.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

One of America's first fine arts presses, it went on to become \"one of the most important and comprehensive art presses of the world,\" often featuring the work of celebrated poets, such as Sylvia Plath, Ted Hughes, James Baldwin side by side with Baskin's bold, stark, energetic and often dramatic black-and-white prints. Called a \"Sculptor of Stark Memorials\" by the \"New York Times,\" Baskin is also known for his wood, limestone, bronze, and large-scale woodblock prints, which ranged from naturalistic to fanciful, and were frequently grotesque, featuring bloated figures or humans merging with animals. \"His monumental bronze sculpture, \"The Funeral Cortege\", graces the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nA committed figurative artist, and the son and brother of rabbis, Baskin's work often focused on mortality, Judaism, the Holocaust and other angst-ridden themes. Repeating a Baskin quote first published in \"Time\" magazine, the \"New York Times\"' Roberta Smith cites it to explain Baskin's allegiance to figurative work and respect for tradition, which was at odds with the abstract expressionist movement that dominated modern art for many decades of his life, and which he firmly rejected:Our human frame, our gutted mansion, our enveloping sack of beef and ash is yet a glory. Glorious in defining our universal sodality and in defining our utter uniqueness. The human figure is the image of all men and of one man. It contains all and can express all.As a young man, at the height of the flowering Boston Expressionist movement centered around the city's Boris Mirski Gallery, Baskin had his first major solo exhibition there in 1956, on the heels of being one of 11 artists featured in the opening exhibition at the Terrain Gallery. He would go on to participate in another 40 exhibitions. Within a decade, he was featured in the 1966 documentary \"Images of Leonard Baskin\" by American filmmaker Warren Forma. In 1972, Baskin won a Caldecott honor for his illustrations of \"Hosie’s Alphabet\", written by his wife, Lisa, and sons Tobias and Hosea, and published by Viking Press. In 1994, he received one of his most important commissions for a 30-foot bas relief for the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial and a bronze statue of a seated figure, also erected in 1994, for the Holocaust Memorial in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \n\nBaskin founded the Gehenna Press in 1942, one of the first fine art presses in the US, as a student at Yale, inspired by the illustrated books of William Blake which so impressed him he decided to learn to print and make his own books. The name was taken from a line in \"Paradise Lost\": \"and black Gehenna call'd, the type of hell\". The Gehenna Press printed over 100 books and ran until Baskin's death in 2000.\n\nIn 1974, Baskin moved with his family to Britain, to Lurley Manor, near Tiverton, Devon, to be close to his friend Ted Hughes, for whom he had illustrated the poetry volume \"Crow\" published in 1970. Baskin and Hughes collaborated on several further works, including \"A Primer of Birds\", published by Gehenna Press in 1981. Other poets who collaborated with the Gehenna Press included James Baldwin, Anthony Hecht and Ruth Fainlight. Sylvia Plath dedicated \"Sculptor\" to Leonard Baskin in her work, \"The Colossus and Other Poems\" (1960). \n\n\"In 1992, a 50-year retrospective of Gehenna Press books toured the country, including a major exhibition at the Library of Congress.\"\n\nHaving vowed to become a sculptor at the age of 15, Baskin studied sculpting as an apprentice to Maurice Glickman from 1937 to 1939 at the Educational Alliance in New York City. Baskin studied at the New York University School of Architecture and Applied Arts from 1939 to 1941. In 1941, he won a scholarship to Yale where he studied for two years, and founded the Gehenna Press. \n\nBaskin served in the US Navy during the final years of World War II, and then in the Merchant Navy. He then studied at The New School for Social Research, where he obtained his B.A. in 1949. \"In 1950 he went to Paris where he studied at the Academie de la Grande Chaumiere, and the following year to Florence to work at the Accademia di Belle Arti.\"\n\nBetween 1952 and 1953, he was an instructor in printmaking at the Worcester Art Museum where he taught the artists Joyce Reopel and Mel Zabarsky. In 1953, he began a twenty-year career teaching printmaking and sculpture at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. After spending several years in the 1970s in England, Baskin returned to the U.S. in 1984, and subsequently taught at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nBaskin's work is held by major museums worldwide, including the Amon Carter Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, Boca Raton Museum of Art, the British Museum, Brooklyn Museum, Brooks Memorial Art Gallery, Detroit Institute of Arts, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Honolulu Museum of Art, Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Jewish Museum, the Library of Congress, Metropolitan Museum of Art, MOMA, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the National Gallery of Art, the New Jersey State Museum, The Newark Museum of Art, Princeton University, Seattle Art Museum, Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Udinotti Museum of Figurative Art, Victoria and Albert Museum, the Vatican Museums, Wesleyan University, Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Worcester Art Museum.\n\nThe archive of his work at the Gehenna Press was acquired by the Bodleian Library at Oxford, England, in 2009. \"A catalogue raisonné of Baskin's graphic works includes 739 works,\" and the McMaster Museum of Art in Hamilton, Ontario owns over 200 of his works, most of which were donated by his brother Rabbi Bernard Baskin. \n\nBaskin was the recipient of six honorary doctorates, and a member of various national and royal academies in Belgium, Italy, and U.S. The National Foundation of Jewish Culture in the U.S. presented him with its Jewish Cultural Achievement Award in Visual Arts in 2000. Other honors and commendations include the:\n\n\nBaskin was born in New Brunswick, NJ. When Baskin was seven, the family relocated to the Jewish Orthodox section of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York. Baskin was first cousin to American modern dancer and choreographer Sophie Maslow. His first wife Esther, a nature writer, the author of “Creatures of Darkness” and “The Poppy and Other Deadly Plants,” and mother to son Tobias, died in 1973 at age 47. Baskin died at age 77 on June 3, 2000, in Northampton, where he resided. He was survived by his second wife Lisa Unger Baskin and their two children Hosea and Lucretia. \n\n\n"}

In 2021, Orchard station will become an interchange with the Thomson–East Coast line which is currently under construction.\n\nPrior to the construction of Orchard MRT station, it was named Scotts from 1967 to 1982, and then renamed to Orchard Boulevard. The station was subsequently renamed to Orchard in 1985. On 1 October 1983, the MRTC awarded the contract for the MRT tunnel from Newton to Somerset as well as Somerset MRT station to Borie SAE and Ong Chwee Kou Building Contractors Limited.\n\nOn 10 May 1984, Orchard Turn, the existing slip road from Orchard Boulevard to Orchard Road, was realigned to facilitate MRT construction works. On 27 April 1985, there was a MRT construction accident at Orchard MRT station which caused 15 workers to be treated for shock.\n\nThe construction of the lifts began in 19 June 2002 and completed on 20 August 2004. The lifts from the concourse to the street level existed for a short while before it was replaced by another lift in October 2007 due to ION Orchard's construction. Additionally, on 29 October 2006, the bus stop on the right side of Orchard Boulevard was shifted to Orchard Turn.\n\nOn 15 January 2008, Exits C and E that connects to Wisma Atria and ION Orchard were closed, and reopened on 21 July 2009 due to the building works of ION Orchard. The western concourse, linked to Exit E and ION Orchard, opened on 20 July 2009 as part of the ION Orchard development.\n\nOn 15 August 2014, LTA announced that Orchard station would be part of the proposed Thomson East-Coast line (TEL). The station will be constructed as part of Phase 3, consisting of 13 stations between Mount Pleasant and Gardens by the Bay, and is expected to be completed in 2021.\n\nThe Contract T219 for the design and construction of Orchard Station and associated tunnels was awarded to Penta-Ocean Construction Co Ltd – Bachy Soletanche Singapore Pte Ltd Joint Venture at a sum of S$498 million on July 2014. Construction will start in 2014, with completion in 2021. \n\nThe linkway between the TEL and NSL platforms was constructed using the pipe-roofing method, while the mining and underpinning method was adopted to construct the new box structure underneath the existing NSL station. Special drilling machines from Europe are being used, capable of drilling in all directions in a low headroom confined space. To minimise disruptions to the current NSL operations, mining works must be carried out strictly according to the approved design, sequence and method in a safe manner without compromising the stability and serviceability of existing surrounding structures.\n\nDue to the station's location in the Orchard Road shopping belt, the station was intended to be the MRT system's showpiece, with S$24 million spent on aesthetic elements. The station's circular concourse has a dome in diameter and an atrium design, and its floor consists of alternating granite tiles laid out in a radial arrangement. To contrast with the concourse floor, burgundy red vitreous panels were installed on parts of the concourse wall, while other walls in the station concourse and at platform level were clad in polished blue granite tiles.\n"}
{"id": "2049039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049039", "title": "Bowed tendon", "text": "Bowed tendon\n\nTendinitis/tendonitis is inflammation of a tendon. Many times, the tendon tissue is torn. A bowed tendon is a horseman's term for a tendon after a horse has sustained an injury that caused the tendon fibers to be torn, and then healed with \"bowed\" appearance.\n\nTendinitis usually involves disruption of the tendon fibers. It is most commonly seen in the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) in a front leg—the tendon that runs down the back of the leg, closest to the surface. Tendinitis is uncommon in the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) of a front leg or either the SDFT or DDFT in a hindleg.\n\nWhen the SDFT is damaged, there is a thickening of the tendon, giving it a bowed appearance when the leg is viewed from the side. Bows usually occur in the middle of the tendon region, although they may also be seen in the upper third, right below the knee or hock (high bows), and lower third, just above the fetlock (low bows).\n\nExcessive strain on a tendon can damage its collagen fibers. This is most commonly seen in performance horses that gallop or jump, who usually strain a tendon as a result of fetlock overextension when their weight is loaded on one leg. The overextension of the fetlock causes overstretching of the flexor tendons, resulting in the rupture of tendon fibers. Horses in intense training, especially those that were not conditioned properly, may damage many collagen fibers. This may occur gradually or suddenly.\n\nAfter the fibers are torn, the tendon hemorrhages and collects fluid (edema), creating swelling and lameness in the area as well as increasing the pressure. The increase in pressure may damage the tendon further by destroying the cross-linking of undamaged collagen fibers and preventing the flow of blood to the area.\n\nThe middle third of the SDFT is most likely to suffer from tendinitis for several reasons.\n\nThe SDFT is narrower in its middle third than its top or bottom sections, making it weaker. The top and bottom of the SDFT has a better supply of blood as well, with the top third supplied by the vessels from the knee, and the bottom third supplied by the vessels in the fetlock. The middle third has a poor supply of blood, relying on the tiny vessels of the peritendon (the membrane that surrounds the tendons). If this supply is for some reason compromised, the collagen fibers in the area may die, weakening the tendon in that area and making it more likely to tear.\n\nThe SDFT branches at the fetlock, creating a sling under the back of the joint. Thus, overextension of the fetlock is more likely to overstretch the SDFT than the DDFT, which simply travels straight down behind the fetlock and pastern, to attach to the coffin bone.\n\n\nEach of these factors encourage the overextension of the fetlock and knee during work. Several of these factors at once can add up.\n\n\nBandage bows are caused by applying a bandage too tightly, creating an acute pressure injury to the tendons. The compression may cause the area to swell once the bandage is removed, giving a \"bowed\" appearance. However, the damage is usually just to the skin and not to the tendon itself.\n\nHorses with bandage bows usually respond to sweats or poultices. These treatments must be applied under a bandage that is not tightly fitted and the bandage should only be left on for a few hours. Cold hosing, NSAIDs and DMSO may also help.\n\nSigns of acute tendinitis include swelling, heat, and pain when the affected area is palpated. If mild, swelling may not be readily apparent, although there will still be heat and pain in the area, as well as mild lameness. If more severe, the injury is usually accompanied by moderate lameness (2-3 on a scale of 5) with obvious swelling.\n\nIt is important not only to palpate the SDFT but the branches of the SDFT, the DDFT, check ligament, and suspensory ligament as well. These structures could have been damaged at the same time as the SDFT. Both legs should be checked, although tendinitis usually only occurs in one leg.\n\nWhen the tendon is healed, it will still have a thickened, bowed appearance that feels firm and woody. However, all heat, lameness, and pain should disappear.\n\nInitial treatment of a bowed tendon should concentrate on anti-inflammatory therapies, including cold water or ice therapy, and anti-inflammatory medications on the direction of a veterinarian. The horse should be confined to a small area until the severity of the injury can be assessed with ultrasound. Standing bandages are helpful, but care should be taken to avoid applying them too tightly.\n\nGenerally speaking, the most important aspect of long-term therapy is controlling the level of exercise. A balance must be struck between two competing ideas: \n\nFor the first several months, large area turnout is discouraged, since even a small amount of running or playing could easily re-injure the weakened tendon. As the tendon heals, it is loaded in increasing amounts. The use of diagnostic ultrasonography is extremely valuable in guiding changes in workload.\n\nMany adjunctive therapies have been attempted to improve the quality of healing or to speed the recovery process. There is no consensus in the veterinary community as to which treatments are the most effective.\n\nThe prognosis for return to full work depends on:\n\n\nThe best way to ensure that an injured horse returns to full work is to rehabilitate the animal correctly. This includes slowly bringing the horse back into training, and giving the horse light exercise each day as the tendon is healing. An impatient trainer who rushes to bring the horse back to intense training is likely to cause re-injury of the tendon.\n\n\nKing, Christine, BVSc, MACVSc, and Mansmann, Richard, VDM, PhD. \"Equine Lameness.\" Equine Research, Inc. 1997.

{"id": "2049045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049045", "title": "Mr. Arkadin", "text": "Mr. Arkadin\n\nMr. Arkadin (first released in Spain, 1955), known in Britain as Confidential Report, is a French-Spanish-Swiss coproduction film, written and directed by Orson Welles and shot in several Spanish locations, including Costa Brava, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. Filming took place throughout Europe in 1954, and scenes shot outside Spain include locations in London, Munich, Paris, the French Riviera, and the Château de Chillon in Switzerland.\n\nGuy Van Stratten (Robert Arden), a small-time American smuggler working in Europe, is found desperately trying to get a man called Jakob Zouk (Akim Tamiroff) to leave his bare, ruinous room in Munich and come with him to safety. When Zouk alleges that he's dying and doesn't want to be disturbed, Stratten desperately tells him why he has to come. We see the story in flashback as he narrates it to Zouk.\n\nIn the flashback, Stratten is with his girlfriend and accomplice Mily (Patricia Medina) in Naples when a man named Bracco is knifed in the street. Bracco does not want his last moments to be taken up with doctors and police, and he rewards the couple for not calling them with two names that he says will be profitable to them: he names Gregory Arkadin to Stratten, and one \"Sophie\" to Mily. They get away as Bracco dies, and approach Arkadin, a famous and super-wealthy businessman (Orson Welles), to see if the murder and vague references to his \"secret\" can be used to blackmail him. Arkadin's only human tie in a life of power and pleasure is his daughter Raina (Paola Mori), and Stratten manages to strike up an acquaintance with her and thus get into Arkadin's castle in Spain. He and Raina also develop feelings for each other, though they cover them up with cool sophistication.\n\nTo Stratten's surprise and Raina's displeasure, Arkadin shows them a dossier he has had compiled about Stratten and Mily's criminal career. He then hires Stratten to find out the truth about his own past; he says he woke up in a square in Switzerland in a new suit with a large sum of money in his pocket, and no memory of who he was or what he had done before that day in 1927. He wants Stratten to tell him.\n\nStratten goes all over the world, picking up clues, while Mily cruises with Arkadin on his yacht and tries to get clues from his own lips. From such people as the proprietor of a flea circus, a junk-shop owner, an impoverished noblewoman in Paris, and a heroin addict he tortures with withdrawal, Stratten learns that the pre-1927 Arkadin was involved in a sex trafficking ring in Warsaw that trapped girls who thought they were joining a dance school, and sent them to be prostitutes in South America. \"Sophie\" turns out to be the former leader of the ring and Arkadin's old girlfriend, from whom he stole the money that was in his pocket in the square. She is now married to a Mexican general, and is a relaxed, tolerant woman who remembers Arkadin with affection and has no intention of publicizing his past.\n\nHowever, while learning all this, Stratten notices that Arkadin is following him and re-interviewing the people he has found. He is puzzled by this, and more puzzled when Raina tells him her father does not have amnesia and thus the story he told of why he hired him was false. Meanwhile, Arkadin learns to his chagrin that Raina actually cares for Stratten and that Stratten wants to marry her.\n\nAt Arkadin's Christmas Eve party in Munich, just before he goes to Zouk's room and tells him all this, Stratten learns to his horror that everybody he tracked down and talked to about Arkadin's past is now dead. Mily has also been found dead, and the clues have been arranged to point to him as the murderer; the police are looking for him. He realizes that Arkadin's real motive for hiring him was to uncover whatever evidence of Arkadin's sordid past so that Arkadin can eliminate said evidence. Arkadin especially does not want his beloved daughter to learn of his past. Zouk is the last surviving member of the sex trafficking ring, and once Zouk is dead, Arkadin will murder Stratten to complete the cover-up.\n\nEven after hearing this, Zouk doesn't care whether he dies of cancer or murder, but Stratten manages to get him to his own hotel room and goes out to get him the special meal he requests. Arkadin intercepts him and mockingly helps him get the meal, but when he takes it to his room, Zouk has been stabbed to death.\n\nStratten realizes that his only hope of survival now is to get to Raina in Spain and tell her her father's secret; he manages to get the very last seat on the crowded Christmas Eve plane to Barcelona. Arkadin fails to persuade the airline to throw Stratten off and give him the seat, and when he pleads with the other passengers for a seat at a tremendous price, Stratten makes them think he is a drunk impostor. Stratten reaches the Barcelona airport just ahead of the one-man private plane Arkadin then hires; Raina meets him, but is almost immediately summoned to the control tower to talk to her father on the radio. With no time to tell her everything, Stratten coaxes her to say over the radio \"he told me everything\". When Arkadin hears the lie, the radio link goes silent, and Arkadin commits suicide by falling out of his rolling plane, which later crashes.\n\nRaina understands why Stratten did this to her father, but is unhappy, and Stratten is unhappy that she is now tremendously rich and thus beyond him. He stays at the airport, and she drives away with a previous boyfriend from England.\n\n\nThe story was based on several episodes of the radio series \"The Lives of Harry Lime\", which in turn was based on the character Welles portrayed in \"The Third Man\". The main inspiration for the plot was the episode entitled \"Man of Mystery\" though some elements may have been lifted from an episode of the radio show \"Ellery Queen\", entitled \"The Case of the Number Thirty-One,\" chiefly the similar-sounding name \"George Arkaris,\" the mysterious birthplace, the French Riviera property and the Spanish castle for example. Most of the other key elements for Arkadin's character come from a real-life arms dealer, Basil Zaharoff.\n\nIn addition, several different versions of the film were released. In his 1991 essay, \"The Seven Arkadins\", film historian Jonathan Rosenbaum identified seven different versions of the story, and since its initial publication, a further two versions have emerged including a novel and a stage play. When Welles missed an editing deadline, Producer Louis Dolivet took the film out of his hands and released several edits of the film, none of which were approved by Welles. Adding to the confusion is a novel of the same title that was credited to Welles, though Welles claimed that he was unaware of the book's existence until he saw a copy in a bookshop.\n\nIn his interview for the BBC's \"Arena\" series first shown in 1982, Welles described \"Mr. Arkadin\" as the \"biggest disaster\" of his life, due to his loss of creative control. The film was not released in the United States until 1962. Some consolation for Welles came in the form of Paola Mori who played the role of Arkadin's daughter. Mori was the stage name for the Countess Paola Di Girfalco, who would become Welles’ third wife. In addition, the film started Welles's longtime relationship with Spain, where he lived for several periods in his life.\n\nReleased in some parts of Europe as \"Confidential Report\", this film shares themes and stylistic devices with \"The Third Man\" (1949). The Criterion Collection has produced a three-DVD box set that includes three separate versions of \"Mr. Arkadin\" including a comprehensive re-edit that combines material taken from all the known versions of the film. Though the creators of this \"restored\" version express their doubts as to the \"correctness\" of altering another artist's work, this new cut is far and away the most comprehensible and easy to follow of any of the known versions. Also included are three of the Harry Lime radio plays reported to have been written by Welles and upon which he certainly based Arkadin. A copy of the Arkadin novelization — which may or may not have been adapted by Welles — is also included in the Criterion Collection as are commentary tracks from Welles' film scholars Jonathan Rosenbaum and James Naremore.\n\nIn his 1991 essay, \"The Seven Arkadins\", film historian Jonathan Rosenbaum identified seven different versions of the story, and since its initial publication, a further two versions have emerged.\n\n1. Three episodes of the radio series \"The Lives of Harry Lime\", written, directed by and starring Welles. The basic plot of a wealthy Mr. Arkadian (spelt with three As in this version) commissioning a confidential report on his former life can be found in the episode \"\"Man of Mystery\"\" (first broadcast 11 April 1952), while the episode \"\"Murder on the Riviera\"\" (first broadcast 23 May 1952) and the final episode \"\"Greek Meets Greek\"\" (first broadcast 25 July 1952) both contain plot elements repeated in the film. Note that in the film, the popular Harry Lime character from \"The Third Man\" is replaced by the less sympathetic Guy Van Stratten, since Welles did not own the copyright to the Lime character as character rights had been bought by Harry Alan Towers for the Lives of Harry Lime radio series.\n\n2. \"Masquerade\", an early version of the screenplay of what would eventually become Mr. Arkadin, has substantial differences from the film versions. The screenplay follows a strictly chronological structure rather than the back-and-forth structure of the film. Many of the scenes in the film are set in different countries, and a lengthy sequence in Mexico is entirely missing from the final film.\n\nCrucially, none of the versions available before 2006 contained all the footage found in the others; each had some elements missing from other versions, and each has substantial editing differences from the others.\n\n3. The main Spanish-language version of \"Mr. Arkadin\". (93 mins) This was filmed back-to-back with the English-language version and was the first to be released, premiering in Madrid in March 1955. Although the cast and crew were largely the same, two characters were played by Spanish actors - Amparo Rivelles plays Baroness Nagel, and Irene Lopez Heredia plays Sophie Radzweickz Martinez. The two scenes with the actresses were reshot in Spanish, but all others had Spanish dubbing over English dialogue. This one credits Robert Arden as \"Bob Harden\".\n\n4. There is a second, longer Spanish-language cut of \"Mr. Arkadin\", which was unknown to Rosenbaum at the time he wrote \"The Seven Arkadins\". (He confessed in the essay to having seen only brief clips of one version.) This one credits Robert Arden as \"Mark Sharpe\".\n\n5. \"\"Confidential Report\"\" (98 mins) - the most common European release print of \"Mr. Arkadin\", which premiered in London in August 1955. Differences to this version include the presence of off-screen narration from Van Stratten. Rosenbaum speculates that the editing of this version was based on an early draft of Welles' screenplay, since its exposition is far simpler than the \"Corinth\" version's.\n\n6. The \"Corinth\" version of \"Mr. Arkadin\". (99 mins) - named after Corinth Films, the initial US distributor of the film. Until the 2006 re-edit, it was believed to be the closest version to Welles' conception. Peter Bogdanovich discovered its existence in 1961, and secured its first US release in 1962, seven years after alternative versions of the film came out in Europe.\n\n7. The most widely seen version of \"Mr. Arkadin\", which was made for television/ home video release and is now in the public domain. (95 mins) It entirely removes the film's flashback structure and presents a simpler, linear narrative. Rosenbaum describes it as \"the least satisfactory version\", which is a \"clumsily truncated\" edit of the \"Corinth\" version, often editing out half-sentences, making some dialogue incomprehensible. As this version is in the public domain, the vast majority of DVD releases are of this version, often in poor-quality transfers.\n\n8. The novel \"Mr. Arkadin\" was first published in French, in Paris in 1955; and then in English in 1956, both in London and New York. Welles was credited as author, and the book's dustjacket boasted \"It is perhaps surprising that Orson Welles … has not written a novel before.\"\n\n\"I didn't write one word of that novel. Nor have I ever read it,\" Welles told Peter Bogdanovich. \"Somebody wrote it in French to be published in serial form in the newspapers. You know — to promote the picture. I don't know \"how\" it got under hardcovers, or who got paid for that.\"\n\nWelles always denied authorship of the book, and French actor-writer Maurice Bessy, who is credited as translating it into French, was long rumoured to be the real author. Rosenbaum suggested that the book was written in French and then translated into English, since lines from the script were approximations that seemed to have been translated from English to French to English again. Research by film scholar François Thomas in the papers of Louis Dolivet has uncovered documentary proof that Bessy was indeed the author.\n\n9. Whilst no version of the film can claim to be definitive as Welles never finished editing the film, this version is likely the closest to Welles' original vision. It was compiled in 2006 by Stefan Drössler of the Munich Film Museum and Claude Bertemes of the Cinémathèque municipale de Luxembourg, with both Peter Bogdanovich and Jonathan Rosenbaum giving technical assistance. It uses all available English-language footage, and attempts to follow Welles' structure and editing style as closely as possible and also incorporating his comments over the years on where the other editions of the film went wrong. However, it still only remains an approximation - for instance, Welles remarked that his version of the film began with a woman's body (Mily) on a beach, including a close-up which makes her identity apparent to the audience. Whilst the Criterion edit restores the film opening on a woman's body on the beach, only a long shot exists (taken from the Corinth version) in which it is unclear whose body it is; and so no close-up of Mily could be used as the footage no longer exists.\n\n\" The Criterion edit\" (106 mins) was released in a 3-disc DVD set which included:\n\nJapanese film director Shinji Aoyama listed \"Confidential Report\" as one of the Greatest Films of All Time in 2012. He said, \"No other movie is destructive as \"Confidential Report\", which gives me different emotions every time I see it. Achieving this kind of indetermination in a film is the highest goal that I always hope for, but can never achieve.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2049066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049066", "title": "Sudairi Seven", "text": "Sudairi Seven\n\nThe Sudairi Seven (, '), also spelled Sudairy or Sudayri, is the commonly used name for a powerful alliance of seven full brothers within the House of Saud. Their father King Abdulaziz 'Ibn Saud' had more sons with their mother Hussa Sudairi than he did with any of his other wives. They are also sometimes referred to as the Sudairi Clan ( ) or the Sudairi faction.\n\nThe oldest (Fahd) served as king from 1982 to 2005; the second- and fourth-oldest (Sultan and Naif) served as crown prince but predeceased King Abdullah; and the sixth-oldest (Salman) succeeded Abdullah as king in 2015. With the 2017 death of Prince Abdul Rahman only the two youngest of the Seven (Salman and Ahmed) survive. Turki had broken off with his brothers in 1978.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, King Ibn Saud rapidly expanded his power base in Nejd to establish the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, and became its first King. As part of this process of expansion, he married women from powerful Nejdi and other Arabian families to cement his control over all parts of his new domain. It is believed he married as many as 22 women as a result. One of these marriages was to Hussa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi, a member of the powerful Al Sudairi clan to which Ibn Saud's mother belonged.\n\nThe number of children that King Ibn Saud fathered in total, with all his wives, is unknown. One source indicates that he had 37 sons. The \"Sudairi Seven\" – the seven sons of King Ibn Saud and Hassa bint Ahmed – were the largest bloc of full brothers and as a consequence, were able to wield a degree of coordinated influence and power. Ibn Saud and Hassa bint Ahmed married twice; their first marriage started in 1913 and may have produced a son, Prince Sa'ad (1914–19). Hassa then married Muhammad bin Abdul-Rahman, the brother of Ibn Saud, with whom she had a son, Prince Abdullah, the father of Fahd bin Abdullah bin Mohammed Al Saud. Hassa and Ibn Saud married again in 1920, and their second marriage produced seven sons and four daughters.\n\n\nThe influence of the Sudairi Seven, which can be termed as \"asabiyya\" (group spirit) following the khaldûnian terminology, grew constantly after the accession of its leader, Prince Fahd, to crown prince in 1975 and then king in 1982. They represented one out of five of King Ibn Saud’s sons. However, they gained influence and power not solely because of their number. Unlike many of King Ibn Saud's other sons who dealt much more with business activities, the Sudairi Seven tended to be interested in politics.\n\nThe Sudairi Seven's rise to power can be traced back to the accession of King Faisal and his earlier struggle with King Saud. Although not a Sudairi himself, Faisal, in his struggle to overthrow Saud, relied heavily upon the seven Sudairi brothers. In 1962, as prime minister and heir apparent, Prince Faisal appointed Prince Fahd as Interior Minister, Prince Sultan as Defense Minister, and Prince Salman as governor of Riyadh. All were key posts. Following his accession to the throne after King Saud's deposition in 1964, King Faisal continued to favor the Sudairi Seven as his allies.\nIn 1975, following the death of King Faisal and the accession of King Khalid, Prince Fahd became Crown Prince and Prince Nayef succeeded him at the Ministry of Interior.\n\nThe Sudairis consolidated their hold over these fiefs by appointing their brothers and sons to their own ministries and other key positions. Late Prince Sultan appointed one of his younger Sudairi brothers – Prince Abdul Rahman – and one of his own sons – Prince Khalid – as his deputies. Another of Prince Sultan’s sons, Prince Bandar, served for two decades as Saudi ambassador in Washington and then head of the Saudi National Security Council. His other son Prince Khalid, the co-commander with U.S. General Norman Schwarzkopf in the Gulf War (1991), became vice defence minister. Late Prince Nayef also appointed one of his sons – Muhammad – as his deputy at the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nThe Sudairis’ rise to power and hold over government brought continuity to the system. It also prompted other princes to align quietly against them. The main opposition to the Sudairis came from Prince Abdullah prior to his accession to the throne. He cultivated allies among his other brothers and with King Faisal’s sons. Upon Prince Abdullah's accession to the throne, he created a new family council, the Allegiance Commission, to determine the future succession. The Sudairis filled a fifth of the council’s seats which is seen as a dilution of Sudairi power since their overall control over the state is perceived as proportionately greater than this.\n\nMai Yamani argues that the Sudairi brothers, previously known as the ‘Sudairi seven’, since King Fahd’s death in August 2005 reduced to \"al-Thaluth\" (‘the trio’), referring only to Prince Sultan, Prince Nayef and Prince Salman. Prince Sultan became the leader of the group after King Fahd's demise.\n\nOn 28 October 2011, Prince Nayef became the Crown Prince after the death of his full brother Prince Sultan, and his other full brother Prince Salman, who had been long-term Riyadh governor, was appointed the minister of defence. However, the eldest surviving member of the Sudairi brothers, Prince Abdul Rahman, was replaced by late Prince Sultan's son Prince Khalid as deputy minister of defence.\n\nPrince Abdul Rahman was reported to argue that he should have been promoted instead of Prince Salman. On the other hand, the youngest of the Sudairi brothers, Ahmed, who was late Prince Nayef's deputy at the ministry of interior since 1975, was reported to complain about that Prince Nayef was actively promoting the interest of his own son, Prince Mohammed. Lastly, another Sudairi Prince Turki, who returned to Riyadh in early 2011 after a long and at least partly voluntary exile in Cairo, was said to agitate for a more senior position. On the other hand, Prince Turki fully supported the appointment of late Prince Nayef as Crown Prince, indicating that the decision was completely right and that Prince Nayef had wisdom, sound management and long history in serving the country. However, although Sudairi brothers support each other against other princes, each attempts to form, with his sons, another power group.\n\nOn 16 June 2012, Crown Prince Nayef died in Geneva. His posts were filled by his younger full-brothers. Prince Salman was named as the Crown Prince and deputy prime minister, and Prince Ahmed as the minister of interior on 18 June 2012. Prince Salman and Prince Ahmed became the only politically active members of the group. However, on 5 November 2012, Prince Ahmed resigned from his post and was succeeded by Mohammed bin Nayef, son of late Prince Nayef. On 23 January 2015, King Abdullah died at the age of 90 and he was succeeded by his half brother Salman.\n\nWith the death of the old King, the new King immediately began to consolidate power on behalf of the clan. His son Mohammad bin Salman became both minister of defense and secretary general of the Court, combining two of the most powerful offices in the government, and his full nephew Mohammed bin Nayef bypassed hundreds of senior princes to become the first of the third generation to be officially placed in the line of succession. On 28 April 2015, Mohammed bin Nayef was named Crown Prince, replacing Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, the youngest half-brother of the Sudairi Seven. Mohammad bin Salman was named as deputy crown prince by his father, thus effectively putting the future of the throne in the Sudairi Seven clan's firm grip. On June 21, 2017 Mohammad bin Salman was made Crown Prince, and Mohammed bin Nayef was removed from his posts and stripped of his titles. The interior minister was succeeded by Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Nayef, the grandson of Salman's elder brother, Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz. Thus the lines of Nayef and Salman, if not those of the other Sudairi brothers, maintain strong influence.\n\n"}

The station connects to Comcentre, Singapore Power Building, Skate Park, 313@Somerset, Cathay Cineleisure Orchard, Centrepoint Shopping Centre, Mandarin Orchard, The Heeren, Faber House, Orchard Point, Peranakan Place and Emerald Hill.\n\nThe section of tracks between this station and Dhoby Ghaut MRT station is the shortest between any two MRT Stations on the North South Line, taking approximately 1 minute for a train to travel between these two stations.\n\nPrior to the construction of the station, it was named Killiney. It was renamed to Somerset in 1985. The construction required a slight diversion of Somerset Road from January 1984. Somerset MRT station was completed on 22 July 1985 after the three-month delay that was due to the difficult ground conditions and problems with backup machinery caused by tunneling from the Orchard MRT station to Somerset MRT station.\n\nConstruction of the lifts started in 28 June 2000 and were completed on 11 July 2002. Exit B of the station was heavily renovated from January 2007 to July 2009. An additional entrance, Exit D, was opened in conjunction with Orchard Gateway on 25 April 2014 along with Exit C which also connects to Orchard Gateway.\n\nA call was made from a public telephone at the station concourse at about 5 p.m. on 26 September 2007 about a bomb at the station.

{"id": "2049087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049087", "title": "Ahmed bin Abdulaziz Al Saud", "text": "Ahmed bin Abdulaziz Al Saud\n\nAhmed bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (; born 5 September 1942) is a member of House of Saud who served as deputy minister of interior of Saudi Arabia from 1975 to 2012 and briefly as Minister of Interior in 2012. He was detained in Saudi Arabia in March 2020 on the orders of his brother and nephew, King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad, and charged with treason.\n\nPrince Ahmed was born in Riyadh on 5 September 1942. He is the son of Ibn Saud and Hassa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi and the youngest of the Sudairi brothers. Prince Ahmed is supposedly the 31st son of Ibn Saud.\n\nAhmed bin Abdulaziz received his primary and secondary education at Princes' School and Anjal Institute in Riyadh. He completed secondary education in 1961. He studied English and some science subjects at the University of Southern California (USC). He then graduated from the University of Redlands in 1968 with a bachelor of arts degree in political science. On 26 July 1999, Prince Ahmed was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities from the University of Redlands.\n\nAfter his graduation, Prince Ahmed dealt with business. He was the chairman of National Gypsum Company from 1969 to 1970. In 1971, he was appointed the undersecretary of Makkah Province. He also served as the deputy governor of Makkah Province during the reign of King Faisal. Later, King Khalid appointed him as the deputy minister of interior in 1975 which lasted until 18 June 2012 when he was named interior minister.\n\nHis main function as deputy interior minister was to deal with the different provinces of the Kingdom. Ahmed bin Abdulaziz was also operational head of special security force, which reports directly to interior minister. This force was established in 1979 after the poor performance of the SANG at the Grand Mosque Seizure in Makkah. \nPrince Ahmed was given the task of introducing reforms in the Eastern Province during the early 1980s to improve the province where the kingdom's Shi’ite minority lives. In fact, this task was given him in the wake of the riots experienced in the province in 1979 to make observations about the effects of the Iranian Revolution and the Shi’ite dissention on the security of oil industry. Prince Ahmad openly declared that the Saudi government had neglected the region and had actively discriminated against its Shi’ite population. He also promised massive investments in the development of Al-Hasa's economic infrastructure, educational system, and other services. The other task of Prince Ahmed as deputy interior minister was to coordinate the contacts with ulema (the religious leaders). He also served as the vice president of the supreme commission for industrial security and chairman of preparatory committee for national security. In addition, he was the deputy chairman of civil defense council. Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi stated that Prince Ahmed was mostly involved in administrative matters instead of security during his tenure as deputy interior minister.\n\nPrince Ahmed was appointed interior minister on 18 June 2012 after the death of interior minister Prince Nayef. It was reported that he would not change the major security policies of Saudi Arabia since the country experienced a threat from Al Qaeda in Yemen and an unrest among its Shi'ite Muslim minority. His appointment as interior minister was also regarded at the time as a move, signalling that he was the most likely candidate to rule Saudi Arabia after King Abdullah and Crown Prince Salman. However, Prince Ahmed's tenure only lasted until 5 November 2012, and he was succeeded by Mohammed bin Nayef, who had been deputy interior minister. The official reason for Prince Ahmed's removal was given as his request. However, his objection to dividing the security forces into independent units was one of the actual reasons for his dismissal.\n\nPrince Ahmed was also the chairman of the supreme hajj committee during his term as interior minister.\n\nNawaf E. Obaid argued in 2002 that three members of House of Saud were especially popular, although many of them were believed to be corrupt. Prince Ahmed was one of these popular members; the others were Crown Prince Abdullah and Riyadh governor Prince Salman. Prince Ahmed was also seen as one of the potential candidates to the Saudi throne at the beginning of the 2000s. However, on 5 November 2012 he was sidelined in the sense that he was left without any major job and on 1 February 2013 Prince Muqrin was appointed second deputy prime minister and on 27 March 2014 to the new position of deputy crown prince.\n\nOn 7 March 2020 Prince Ahmed was arrested in addition to the former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef and Prince Nawwaf bin Nayef based on the claims of plotting to overthrow King Salman. His son, Prince Nayef bin Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, who served as the head of Land Forces Intelligence and Security Authority, was also detained on the same day.\n\nTogether with interior minister Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz, Prince Ahmed was reported to pay massive bonuses to successful security officers, but they also had a reputation for honesty and using the massive security budget only for the mission and not to enrich themselves.\n\nAhmed bin Abdulaziz visited Pakistan in November 2005 for three days and examined the extent of destruction caused by the Kashmir earthquake from an airplane. He promised to provide Pakistan whatever needed for the rebuilding process after the earthquake. He encouraged all Muslim nations to provide aid to Pakistan. He also condemned terrorism and stated it was incompatible with Islam. Prince Ahmed called for a \"border fence\" between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. The plan for the fence was initiated in 2006 and he stated repeatedly it would not become a \"segregation wall\".\n\nOn 29 November 2010, he attended the Crown Prince Cup, an annual horse race on behalf of Crown Prince Sultan, who was in Morocco. He said in a press conference in 2011 that for women, driving is against the law. After his appointment as interior minister, it was argued that, like Salman, he was also a supporter of King Abdullah's cautious reform initiatives.\n\nPrince Ahmed eventually left Saudi Arabia for London. On 4 September 2018, Prince Ahmed was confronted by protesters shouting slogans against him and the Saud Dynasty outside his residence in London. Prince Ahmed responded to the protesters by asking them to blame the current ruling Saudi Monarch and the current Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman instead. Following the repercussions from the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, news reports suggested that he had returned to Saudi Arabia in October 2018 (after he got guarantees from the US and UK Governments regarding his personal security) to help the Royal Family control the situation and possibly help usurp some of the Crown Prince's powers.\n\nAhmed bin Abdulaziz has two wives with whom he has five daughters and seven sons. His eldest son, Abdulaziz (born 1963), is secretary general of Arab Ophthalmology. Another son, Nayef, holds a PhD from Cambridge University and is a colonel in the Saudi Armed Forces with responsibilities for strategic planning. He served as the head of Land Forces Intelligence and Security Authority until his arrest on 7 March 2020.\n\nOne of Prince Ahmed's daughters, Falwa bint Ahmed, is married to Salman bin Sultan, former assistant general secretary of the National Security Council and Prince Sultan's son. Another son, Prince Sultan, was appointed by Royal Decree as Saudi Ambassador to the Kingdom of Bahrain, and he is known to have a keen interest in politics and international affairs.\n\nPrince Ahmed was honorary president of Saudi Alzheimer's Charitable Society.\n\n"}

It was first created in 1990, replacing the abolished electorate of Sadadeen, and was named after Tony Greatorex, the last President of the Legislative Council. Greatorex was a mostly urban electorate, covering an area of 76 km², and encompassing the Alice Springs suburbs of Sadadeen and Traeger Park. There were 4,606 people enrolled in the electorate as of August 2012.\n\nAlice Springs has always been a conservative area, and has generally been considered Country Liberal Party heartland. However, Greatorex was located in a particularly conservative portion of Alice Springs, and its demographics suggested that it should have been a very safe CLP seat even by Alice Springs standards. Nonetheless, conservative independent Denis Collins won the seat when it was first contested in 1990. Collins had represented most of the electorate as the member for Sadadeen since 1983, and before then had represented Alice Springs from 1980 to 1983, and was a former CLP MLA. He was defeated at the 1994 election by endorsed CLP candidate Dr Richard Lim. Lim was easily re-elected in 1997 and 2001, and was one of only four CLP members to survive the Labor landslide victory at the 2005 election, despite the presence of a Labor star candidate in high-profile Alice Springs mayor Fran Kilgariff. Lim resigned from parliament on 9 July 2007 in the middle of his fourth term. He was replaced by another CLP member, former radio broadcaster Matt Conlan, at the resulting by-election on 28 July.\n\nGreatorex was abolished at the 2016 general election, with its constituents divided between Araluen, Braitling and Namatjira.\n"}

Located underneath Sengkang Central near the junction with Compassvale Bow, Buangkok station is one of the two MRT stations located within the Sengkang planning area. The station serves the town of Buangkok, which sandwiches between the Trafalgar and Compassvale subzones of the Hougang and Sengkang planning areas respectively.\n\nHowever, this station is on close proximity to Hougang Central as compared to Sengkang Town Centre.\n\nThere are plans to build an \"integrated development\" next to Buangkok station, which will include residential units, commercial spaces and a future bus interchange. The residential units are now known as Sengkang Grand Residences, the commercial spaces are now known as Sengkang Grand Mall while the future bus interchange is now known as Buangkok Bus Interchange respectively.\n\nBuangkok station is near housing estates and Palm View Primary School.\n\nWhen the North East line opened, it was one of the 2 completed MRT stations in the entire system that was non-operational, the other being Woodleigh which opened on 20 June 2011. Buangkok was originally planned to be opened with 15 other stations on the North East line. However, the operator SBS Transit decided not to open the station as the area around the station was relatively undeveloped and the company claimed that the number of passengers would be too low to cover operating costs.\n\nWith the first development being ready at Compassvale Arcadia on April 2005, the station was opened on 15 January 2006. To prepare for the station's opening, the programming had to be updated to include Buangkok. Residents had said they would be willing to walk 400 metres to the station every day.\n\nThe station opened with much fanfare on that day. SBS Transit had expected around 3,500 commuters using the station daily, which would be the lowest among all the stations along the line, resulting in the station making a loss.\n\nEven so, ridership on this station was much lower than expected on its opening week. It had an average of only 1,386 passenger trips per day. As a comparison, Clarke Quay station, the next lowest in terms of ridership, had already more than 6,000 commuter trips per day. However, Clarke Quay was located in the Central Business District with considerable development in the area. This was because the station was located over 400 metres from most residents' homes.\n\nCash top ups are not accepted at the passenger service centres from 5 January 2018 at this station.\n\nOn 27 August 2005, during Minister Vivian Balakrishnan's visit to Punggol South, a resident, displeased with Buangkok's disuse, erected a series of white paper cut-outs of elephants, which were drawn in a cartoon-like style, symbolically calling the unopened Buangkok station a 'white elephant'. Soon after, police started an investigation on it as a case of a public display without permit, on the grounds that a complaint was received and that they may have been in violation of the Public Entertainment and Meetings Act, for which the maximum penalty is a fine not exceeding $10,000. It raised controversy because many people saw it as a harmless, trivial case not worthy of investigation. It also highlighted the general displeasure over the non-operation of the MRT station after it was built with public funds. It also raised questions on how much freedom of expression the government is willing to tolerate. On 6 October that year, police closed the investigation without pressing charges but issued a stern warning to the offender. This led then-Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng to comment to the media, \"We cannot apply the law to some and turn a blind eye to others. If we do, then the law becomes the real white elephant.\"\n\nOn 13 January 2006, during a carnival celebrating the opening of the MRT station, some 27 students from Raffles Girls' School were preparing to sell T-shirts bearing \"Save the White Elephants\" to raise funds for a charity Youth Guidance. This prompted a warning from the police that they needed a fund-raising permit and that \"wearing of T-shirts en masse may be misconstrued by some as an offence under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public & Order & Nuisance) (Assemblies & Processions) Rules.\" \n\nThe girls said that they had always taken a strong interest in current affairs and Buangkok incident inspired them to start what they called \"Project White Elephant\" aiming to \"galvanise the youth of today to rise up from the apathy they are stereotyped with and take an active role in airing their views\". Punggol South grassroots leaders were impressed by their \"entrepreneurial spirit and derring-do\", and invited them to set up a stall at the opening ceremony of the station to sell the T-shirts.\n\nOn 21st of that month, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng apologised for the way the police had overreacted to the group of school girls' plan to sell and wear white elephant T-shirts at the opening of Buangkok station.\n\nOn the morning of 29 July 2016, there was a train fault at this station, delaying train services between Punggol and Potong Pasir stations in the middle of the morning rush hour.\n"}

He was then appointed Minister of Defense. He was also named the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia in 2012 following the death of his brother Nayef bin Abdulaziz. Salman became King in 2015 following the death of his half-brother, King Abdullah. He is the oldest surviving son of Ibn Saud.\n\nHis major initiatives as king include the Saudi intervention in the Yemeni Civil War, Saudi Vision 2030, and a 2017 decree allowing Saudi women to drive. His son, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, is considered the \"de facto\" ruler of Saudi Arabia and has led many reforms within the country, as well as engendering a number of controversies, including the 2017 arrest of members of the Saudi royal family and the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nSalman was born on 31 December 1935, and is reported to be the 25th son of Ibn Saud, the first monarch and founder of Saudi Arabia. Salman and his six full brothers make up the Sudairi Seven. He was raised in the Murabba Palace.\n\nSalman received his early education at the Princes' School in the capital city of Riyadh, a school established by Ibn Saud specifically to provide education for his children. He studied religion and modern science.\n\n Salman was appointed deputy governor of Riyadh Province in 17 March 1954, aged 19, and held the post until 19 April 1955. He was appointed the provincial governor in 5 February 1963, and remained in that office until 5 November 2011.\n\nAs governor, he contributed to the development of Riyadh from a mid-sized town into a major urban metropolis. He served as an important liaison to attract tourism, capital projects and foreign investment to his country. He favored political and economic relationships with the West. During his governorship, Salman recruited advisors from King Saud University.\n\nDuring Salman's five decades as Riyadh governor, he became adept at managing the delicate balance of clerical, tribal, and princely interests that determine Saudi policy. He was also the chairman of the King Abdulaziz Foundation for Research and Archives (KAFRA), King Abdulaziz Museum, the Prince Salman Center for Disability Research and the Prince Fahd bin Salman Charitable Society for the Care of Kidney Patients.\n\nKing Salman also undertook several foreign tours while he was governor. In 1974, he visited Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar to strengthen Saudi Arabia's relationship with those nations. During his visit to Montreal, Canada in 1991, he inaugurated a gallery. In 1996, he was received in the Élysée Palace in Paris by the then-French president Jacques Chirac. The same year he toured Bosnia and Herzegovina to give donations to the Muslim citizens of the country. Being a part of an Asian tour in 1998, Salman visited Pakistan, Japan, Brunei and China.\n\nAccording to the \"Washington Post\", Saudi journalist the late Jamal Khashoggi \"criticized Prince Salman, then governor of Riyadh and head of the Saudi committee for support to the Afghan mujahideen, for unwisely funding Salafist extremist groups that were undermining the war [in Afghanistan against the Soviets].\"\n\nUnder Salman, Riyadh became one of the richest cities in the Middle East and an important place for trade and commerce. There were also infrastructural advances including schools, universities and sports stadiums. About the province, he said:\n\nEvery village or town in the Riyadh Region is dear to me, and holds a special place in my heart ... I witnessed every step taken by the city of Riyadh, and for this reason it is difficult for me to think about being far away from Riyadh. \n\nOn 5 November 2011, Salman was appointed Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, replacing his full brother, the late Crown Prince Sultan (at Defense). Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz was named governor of Riyadh Province. Prince Salman was also named a member of the National Security Council (NSC) on the same day.\n\nIt is speculated that he was placed in the immediate line of succession due to his personal qualities. First, he has a conciliatory and diplomatic nature. He headed the family council, called The Descendants' Council (\"Majlis al Uthra\" in Arabic), that was established by King Fahd in 2000 to solve family matters, reach consensus and try to avoid any publicly embarrassing behaviour by some family members. Second, Salman belongs to the \"middle generation\" in the royal family; therefore, he could develop close ties with both generations socially and culturally. Last, as a result of his long-term governorship, he had developed a network of relationships within Arab and international circles.\n\nSalman continued the policy of military intervention in Bahrain, to try to crush the Bahrain uprising. In April 2012, Salman visited both the United States and the United Kingdom where he met with US President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron. 2013 saw Saudi military spending climb to $67bn, overtaking that of the UK, France and Japan to place fourth globally. As defense minister, Salman was head of the military as Saudi Arabia joined the United States and other Arab countries in carrying out airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in 2014.\n\nOn 18 June 2012, Salman was appointed as Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia shortly after the death of his brother, Crown Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. Prince Salman was also made First Deputy Prime minister. His nomination as crown prince and deputy prime minister was seen by some as a signal that King Abdullah's cautious reforms were likely to continue. On the other hand, Saudi reformists stated that while Prince Salman, in contrast to other Saudi royals, took a more diplomatic approach towards them, he could not be considered a political reformer. They also argued that, like King Abdullah, Salman focused mainly on economic improvement rather than political change.\n\nOn 27 August 2012, the Royal Court announced that Salman was in charge of state affairs whilst King Abdullah was out of the country. Prince Salman launched a Twitter account on 23 February 2013. In September 2012, Salman was named as the deputy chairman of the military service council. He is a strong advocate for philanthropy in poor Muslim nations such as Somalia, Sudan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.\n\nOn 23 January 2015, Salman, aged 79, inherited the throne after his half-brother Abdullah died of pneumonia at the age of 90. The new king issued a statement which read \"His Highness Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and all members of the family and the nation mourn Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, who passed away at exactly 1 am this morning.\" He appointed his younger half-brother, Prince Muqrin, as the Crown Prince.\n\nAfter coming to power, Salman reshuffled the cabinet on 30 January 2015. Khalid bin Ali bin Abdullah al-Humaidan was made the intelligence chief. Prince Bandar bin Sultan was removed from his post in the security council and the adviser to the monarch was also removed as were the former monarch's sons Turki as governor of Riyadh and Mishaal as governor of Mecca. Ali al-Naimi remained the minister of petroleum and mineral resources, as did Saud al-Faisal of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ibrahim Al-Assaf as finance minister. Salman also \"gave a bonus of two months' salary to all Saudi state employees and military personnel\", including pensioners and students, while also asking citizens to \"not forget me in your prayers\".\n\nIn February 2015, he received Prince Charles during his six-day tour in the Middle East. They \"exchanged cordial talks and reviewed bilateral relations\" between the countries.\n\nOne of the first things the King and his son, Mohammad bin Salman, did was to streamline the government bureaucracy. On the death of King Abdullah, there were as many as eleven government secretariats, and all of these were abolished and reconstituted as only two, the Council of Political and Security Affairs (CPSA), headed by Deputy Crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, and the Council for Economic and Development Affairs (CEDA), headed by the Secretary-General of the Royal Court, Prince Mohammad bin Salman, who were given free rein to completely reorganize the government and cementing the power of the Sudairi faction, to which both princes belong.\n\nIn March 2015, the king ordered the bombing of Yemen and military intervention against the Shia Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was deposed in the 2011 uprising. He first put together a coalition of ten Sunni Muslim countries. Code-named Operation Decisive Storm, this was the first time the Saudi Air Force had launched airstrikes against another country since the 1990–91 Gulf War.\n\nAccording to Farea Al-Muslim, direct war crimes have been committed during the conflict; for example, an IDP camp was hit by a Saudi airstrike. Human Rights Watch (HRW) wrote that the Saudi-led air campaign had conducted airstrikes in apparent violation of the laws of war. Human rights groups have also criticized Saudi Arabia for the alleged use of cluster bombs against Yemeni civilians.\n\nIn April 2015, three months after becoming king, Salman appointed a full nephew, Muhammad bin Nayef, as the new Crown Prince to replace his youngest brother Prince Muqrin. Furthermore, he made his son, Mohammad bin Salman, the Deputy Crown Prince. Almost all powers under the king were concentrated in the hands of the crown prince and deputy crown prince, both of whom held the portfolio determining all security and economic development issues in Saudi Arabia.\n\nKing Salman then removed Muhammad bin Nayef from the line of succession to the Saudi throne on 21 June 2017 and designated his son Mohammad bin Salman as the new crown prince. At the same time, King Salman removed Muhammad bin Nayef from his other positions in the Saudi government. Mohammad bin Salman has been described as the power behind the throne.\n\nIn May 2015 the King Salman Center for Relief and Humanitarian Aid (KSRelief) was established to deliver aid internationally to victims of civil war and natural disaster, working with the UN and other agencies. As of June 2018, KSRelief has implemented more than 400 individual projects in 40 countries at a cost of $1.8 billion. Moreover, in 2018, KSRelief assisted 180,555 Syrian patients living in Zataari Syrian refugees camp in Jordan. In 2019, KSRelief signed a memorandum of cooperation with UNICEF that aims at enhancing cooperation in the humanitarian field, exchanging knowledge, sharing experiences, promoting voluntary work and boosting capacity building programs. Until 2019, the center provided 1,839 Yemeni civilians wounded during the war with prosthetic limbs for a total amount of $2.3 million.\n\nIn its ongoing efforts to support people of Yemen, KSRelief organized a vocational training program to train women in Yemen to enable them to earn money for themselves and their families. In a similar context, under the umbrella of the UN, KSRelief has led an international team to implement a rehabilitation project for the children affected by war in Yemen. Moreover, as part of the 40th session of the UN Human Rights' Council, KSRelief organized an event entitled: Children and the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen where it presented a number of facts and figures related to the amount of assistance provided by the center to the people of Yemen. This includes the implementation of 328 projects for an amount of $2 billion. Furthermore, in 2018 alone KSRelief provided medical services to 2,501,897 Yemenis.\n\nIn 2019, KSrelief signed a number of agreements with different civil society organizations to implement relief projects for the benefit of Palestinian and Syrian refugees as well as the host Lebanese community. An agreement was concluded with the UNHCR to support the families affected by war for an amount of $5 million. Another one was concluded with IOM to help Syrian refugees under the poverty line for an amount of $3.8 million.\n\nIn February 2012, Ali Mohammed Baqir al-Nimr was arrested for participating in, and encouraging, pro-democracy protests, when he was 16 or 17 years old. In May 2014, Ali Al-Nimr was sentenced to be executed, despite the minimum age for execution being 18 when a crime is committed. Ali Al-Nimr has reported that he was tortured during his detention. As of 23 September 2015, the sentence awaited ratification by King Salman.\n\nIn February 2015, a man from Hafar Al-Batin was sentenced to death for rejecting Islam. In June 2015, Saudi Arabia's Supreme Court upheld the sentence of 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prison for Raif Badawi, a Saudi Arabian blogger who was imprisoned in 2012 after being charged for 'insulting Islam'.\n\nIn April 2020, the Saudi Supreme Court stated under a royal decree made by King Salman that minors who commit crimes will no longer face execution, but would be sentenced to imprisonment in a juvenile detention facility for a maximum of 10 years.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Ashton Carter met with the King and his Arabian military counterpart, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, at Jeddah to answer regional security concerns in the Kingdom and the Gulf states over lifting Iranian economic and conventional military sanctions as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action outlines. The King has misgivings over the deal since it would increase the regional power of Iran especially in the proxy conflicts in Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. In January 2016, Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Saudi Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr. Iran warned that the House of Saud would pay a high price for the execution of Sheikh Nimr by God's will.\n\nSaudi Arabia has emerged as the main group to finance and arm the rebels fighting against the Syrian government. Saudi Arabia openly backed the Army of Conquest, an umbrella rebel group that reportedly included an al-Qaeda linked al-Nusra Front and another Salafi coalition known as Ahrar al-Sham.\n\nIn May 2019, leaders of Gulf and Arab states held two emergency summits in Mecca to present a united front to Iran. Salman accused Iran of threatening global oil supplies and shipping at a meeting of Arab leaders that called on the international community to confront Tehran following attacks on shipping and rising tensions in the oil rich region. Salman said \"what the Iranian regime is doing, from intervening in regional countries’ affairs and developing its nuclear program, threatening global maritime traffic and global oil supplies, is a blatant violation of the treaties and principles of the United Nations.\" He urged the international community should \"use all means to deter this regime.\"\n\nKing Salman has been implicated in the Panama Papers leaks, with two companies originating in the British Virgin Islands taking mortgages in excess of US$34 million to purchase property in central London. His role has not been specified. According to TeleSUR, \"King Salman’s net worth is estimated at US$17.0 billion.\" The then-Crown Prince Muhammad bin Nayef has also been named in association with the Papers.\n\nFurther government reforms took place in June 2018, when King Salman replaced the labor and Islamic affairs ministers. The appointment as labor minister of Ahmed al-Rajhi, a businessman, signalled a growing role for private sector expertise in the Saudi government. The new minister for Islamic affairs, Abdullatif al-Alsheikh, had previously been credited with reining in the power of the religious police.\n\nAt the same time King Salman ordered the establishment of a new Ministry of Culture, with responsibility for delivering Saudi Vision 2030's cultural goals; and the Council of Royal Reserves, tasked with environmental protection.\n\nSalman was often a mediator in settling royal conflicts among the extended Al Saud family – estimated at 4,000 princes. He was a prominent figure of the royal council, which allowed him to select which princes will be delegated which responsibilities of the Kingdom.\n\nSalman and his family own a media group, including pan-Arab daily \"Asharq Al-Awsat\" and \"Al Eqtisadiah\". Though he owns only ten percent of the Saudi Research and Marketing Group (SRMG), he is often referred by auditors as its owner. He reportedly controls the organization through his son Prince Faisal, who is a former chairman of the concern. The SRMG publishes such daily papers as \"Arab News\", \"Asharq Al-Awsat\" and \"Al Eqtisadiah\" through its subsidiary Saudi Research and Publishing Company (SRPC).\nIn a similar vein, Salman is reported to have some strong alliances with significant journalists. He is said to be close to Al Arabiya TV director and \"Asharq Al-Awsat\" journalist Abdelrahman Al Rashid and to Othman Al Omeir, who launched and is the owner of the liberal e-newspaper \"Elaph\". King Salman is thought to have connections with the \"Elaph\" website.\n\nSalman holds traditional views with regards to political reforms and social change. In November 2002, in reference to charitable organizations accused of terrorism (e.g. al-Haramain Foundation, Saudi High Commission for Relief of Bosnia and Herzegovina), he stated that he had personally taken part in the activities of such organizations, but added \"I know the assistance goes to doing good. But if there are those who change some work of charity into evil activities, then it is not the Kingdom's responsibility, nor its people, which helps its Arab and Muslim brothers around the world.\"\n\nAl Jazeera referred to Salman's views reported in a 2007 US diplomatic cable. Salman said that \"the pace and extent of reforms depend on social and cultural factors, ... that for social reasons—not [religious] reasons—reforms cannot be imposed by the [Saudi government] or there will be negative reactions, ... [and] that changes have to be introduced in a sensitive and timely manner.\" According to the cable, he said that \"democracy should not be imposed\" in Saudi Arabia, since the country \"is composed of tribes and regions and if democracy were imposed, each tribe and region would have its political party.\"\n\nSalman bin Abdulaziz has been married three times. , he had thirteen children. His first wife was Sultana bint Turki Al Sudairi, who died aged 71 in late-July 2011. She was a first cousin of Salman, being a daughter of his maternal uncle Turki bin Ahmad Al Sudairi, who was a former governor of the Asir Province. Sultana Al Sudairi supported the Prince Fahd bin Salman Charitable Society for the Care of Kidney Patients and other charitable organizations in the country. His children from this marriage are Prince Fahd (died 2001), Prince Sultan, Prince Ahmed (died 2002), Prince Abdulaziz, Prince Faisal and Princess Hassa.\n\nHis eldest son, Fahd bin Salman, died of heart failure aged 47 in July 2001. His third son, Ahmad bin Salman, died after a heart attack in July 2002 aged 43. Sultan bin Salman became the first person of royal blood, the first-ever Arab, and the first Muslim to fly in outer space when he flew aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-51-G) in June 1985. Sultan bin Salman is currently the chairman of the Saudi Space Commission. Prince Sultan bin Salman was formerly the chairman of the Saudi Commission for Tourism & Antiquities (SCTA), which later was changed to be the ministry of Tourism. Abdulaziz bin Salman has been the deputy minister of oil since 1995, then the minister of Energy since 2019 Faisal bin Salman is the governor of Madinah province.\n\nHis child from his second marriage with Sarah bint Faisal Al Subai'ai (divorced) is Prince Saud. His children from his third marriage with Fahda bint Falah bin Sultan Al Hathleen are Prince Mohammed, Prince Turki, Prince Khalid, Prince Nayif, Prince Bandar, and Prince Rakan.\n\nPrince Mohammad was his private adviser at the Ministry of Defense and at the Crown Prince Court. Mohammad was appointed as the Minister of Defense and head of the royal court upon his father's accession to the throne in January 2015. Turki bin Salman became the chairman of the Saudi Research and Marketing Group in February 2013, replacing his elder brother Faisal bin Salman.\n\nSalman was the closest brother to Crown Prince Sultan, having remained at his side during his constant illness and recovery in New York and Morocco, from 2008–11. Prince Sultan described him as \"the prince of loyalty\" in a letter sent to him. Salman was also King Fahd's most trusted adviser during his reign.\n\nHis legal counsel was William Jeffress Jr., of U.S.-based firm Baker Botts LLP, in a lawsuit filed by families of victims of the September 11 attacks from 2002–10.\n\nIn August 2010, Salman underwent spinal surgery in the United States and remained out of the kingdom for recovery. He has had one stroke and despite receiving physiotherapy; his left arm does not work as well as his right. Salman also suffers from mild dementia, specifically Alzheimer's.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials believe that King Salman has been kept apart from his wife Princess Fahda bint Falah Al Hathleen for several years, on the orders of their son Prince Mohammad bin Salman. He was reportedly concerned that she opposed his plans for a power grab that could divide the royal family, and might have tried to prevent it. The officials interviewed said the prince placed his mother under house arrest without the king's knowledge.\n\nSalman received the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Al-Turath Charity Foundation in the field of urban heritage in 2013. In 2017, Salman pledged US$15,000,000 for Rohingya Muslim refugees in Bangladesh.\n\n\n\n"}

The ring consists of nineteen carbon atoms, with four nitrogen atoms in the core of the molecule. In this sense, corrole is very similar to porphyrin, which is also an organic macrocycle but has twenty carbon atoms and is found in hemoglobin and chlorophyll.\n\nCorroles can be prepared through organic synthesis by condensation reaction of a benzaldehyde with pyrrole in a water / methanol / hydrochloric acid mixture to an open-ring bilane (or tetrapyrrane) followed by oxidation and ring closure with \"p\"-chloranil:\n\nCorrole has several important differences from porphyrin. The first is that it is normally a trianionic ligand with transition metals, while porphyrin is typically a dianionic ligand. As a result, many metallocorroles are formally high-valent, even though several are noninnocent, with a corrole radical-dianion ligand. The second difference from porphyrin is that, because the ring of corrole is smaller, there is slightly less space in the middle of it, which results in many metals sitting slightly out of the plane created by the four nitrogen atoms in the ring. See \"Porphyrins and similar compounds\" in Conjugated systems for more about these side by side images of porphyrin, chlorin, and corrin structures:\nCorroles have been attached to a wide range of transition metals, main group elements, and more recently, lanthanides, actinides. and the diprotonated, neutral corrole radical. Additionally, corroles and their metal complexes have been demonstrated to be useful as imaging agents in tumor detection, oxygen sensing, for prevention of heart disease, in synthetic chemistry as oxo, imido, and nitrido transfer agents, and as catalysts for the catalytic reduction of oxygen to water, and hydrogen production form water under aerobic conditions.\n\n"}

Incumbent Republican Governor Jeb Bush was term-limited, and could not run for reelection to a third consecutive term. The election was won by Republican Charlie Crist, the state's Attorney General. The election was notable in that for the first time, the state elected a Republican governor in three consecutive elections.\n\nTurnout for the 2006 election was down 8.5% from 2002 and down 2.7% from 1998. With Republicans holding the seat, the state avoided the wave in which Democrats netted a gain of six governorships across the nation. As of 2020, this is the last time a victorious Florida gubernatorial candidate won an absolute majority of the vote.\n\nJim Davis won the Democratic primary on September 5. Davis was the Congressman from Florida's 11th congressional district and served in the Florida House of Representatives, where he also served as the Majority Leader. On September 13, Davis selected former State Senator and 2002 gubernatorial candidate Daryl Jones of Miami as his running mate.\n\nThe Democratic primary turned heated as it approached primary day. Rod Smith attacked Jim Davis for a 1990 legislative vote denying restitution for two black men wrongfully imprisoned for murder. Davis countered that Smith was a \"pawn\" of the sugar industry, and that \"big business\" and special interests were funding many of Smith's attack ads.\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Crist, the Republican candidate, won the primary on September 5 with 64% of the vote. Crist was Florida's Attorney General at the time. Previously he was elected State Education Commissioner, and has served in the Florida Senate. He faced Bob Graham for his seat in the United States Senate in 1998. On September 13, 2006, Crist announced that State Representative Jeff Kottkamp of Cape Coral would be his running mate.\n\nThe GOP primary did not end up being very competitive. Crist touted experience in statewide offices, and a strong fundraising capability. He portrayed himself as relatively moderate on social issues, which created some misgivings among conservative Republicans in the state, but not nearly enough to sway the vote to Tom Gallagher.\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Crist won by over 7 points, winning all Republican-leaning areas of Florida, as well as the notable \"swing\" region along the I-4 corridor (Daytona Beach, Orlando, Tampa/St. Petersburg). Davis performed well in the Democrat-leaning south Florida, Gainesville, and Tallahassee areas. Crist under-performed compared to his predecessor Jeb Bush, but still outpaced Davis, despite the low turnout. Reform Party candidate Max Linn received nearly 2% of the vote, but his sizeable haul of over 92,500 votes was still not enough to sway the election. Crist also won 18% of the African American, which outpaced previous Republicans' efforts in attracting this voting bloc in statewide elections.\n\nAlso on the ballot the same day was a constitutional amendment to raise the requirement for all future ballot initiatives to a supermajority (60%). Previously, constitutional amendments put on the ballot required only a simple majority (50% +1) to be approved, and led to some controversial amendments being put on the ballot. Support and opposition for the amendment fell loosely along party lines with Democrats generally opposing its passage. Both Crist and Davis publicly opposed the measure, but it was passed anyway by the voters with a 55% margin - a higher margin than either candidate received. \n\n\n"}

There are 50 members in this committee.\n\nAttempts were made to create a congressional committee on education and labor starting with the early congresses but issues over Congress's constitutional ability to oversee such issues delayed the committee's formation. Finally, on March 21, 1867, the Committee on Education and Labor was founded following the end of the Civil War and during the rapid industrialization of America. On December 19, 1883, the committee was divided into two, the Committee on Education and the Committee on Labor. The committees again merged on January 2, 1947, after the passage of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, becoming the Committee on Education and Labor again. On January 4, 1995, when the Republicans took over the House, the Committee was renamed the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities. It was renamed again as the Committee on Education and the Workforce two years later on January 7, 1997. On January 4, 2007, with the Democrats once again in the majority, the committee's name was changed back to Committee on Education and Labor. After Republicans recaptured the House majority in the 2010 elections, they returned to the name, Committee on Education and the Workforce, effective with the opening of the 112th Congress in 2011.

The main function of an \"optio\" was as an \"optio centuriae\", the second-in-command of a century, although there were many other roles an \"optio\" could adopt.\n\n\"Optiones\" were vital in the Roman army. An \"optio\" was stationed at the rear of the ranks to keep the troops in order. Their duties would include enforcing the orders of the centurion, taking over the centurion's command in battle should the need arise, supervising his subordinates, and a variety of administration duties.\n\n\"Optio\" pay was double the standard legionary pay and they were the most likely men to replace the centurion if the position became vacant.\n\nTitles held by \"optiones\" included:\n\n\nUnlike the centurion, the cuirass was not the distinguishing part of the \"optio\"'s uniform. The identifying part would be his helmet; this would have had plumes of horse hair or feathers on either side of his helmet that could be accompanied by a helmet crest. \n\nAn \"optio\"'s armour would be more like those of the common legionary. He could wear the lorica segmentata or a lorica hamata as well as have his gladius on the right, not the left, side. One thing that did separate him from the common legionary was the staff (called a hastile), which was used to keep the legionaries in line. This staff would be roughly as tall as the \"optio\" himself. \"Optiones\" often carried wax tablets on which they kept the orders of the day.\n\n"}

It was released on 22 August 2005 in the UK as the album's second single. The song was written by Gallagher in the summer of 2004, before the band made their final attempt at recording what would become \"Don't Believe the Truth\".\n\nThe song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, staying there for a week, marking the first time that Oasis had ever earned two successive number ones in the same calendar year (having also charted at number one earlier in 2005 with \"Lyla\"). \"The Importance of Being Idle\" would prove to be the band's last UK number one prior to their break-up in 2009. As of 2019, it is also their most recent single release to be certified Silver in the UK. Noel got the title from the book of the same name, which he found whilst cleaning out a garage (it belonged not to him, but to his then-girlfriend and current wife, Sara MacDonald).\n\nIn an interview with \"Q magazine\", Noel Gallagher stated that \"The Importance of Being Idle\" sounds like songs from two British bands, The Kinks and The La's. In particular, the guitar playing, as well as the sentiment expressed, is noticeably similar to The Kinks' \"Sunny Afternoon\" and \"Dead End Street\". He also said that the lyrics are inspired by his own laziness. Additionally, the line \"I begged my doctor for one more line\" may be a reference to Noel's account of how he gave up cocaine in 1998.\n\nThe guitar sound is similar also to The La's B-sides \"Clean Prophet\". It also is a breakaway from the sound of Oasis's former albums, especially the straight ahead rock and roll anthems of \"Heathen Chemistry\". The piano used on the pre-chorus sections was bought by bassist Andy Bell from the auction website eBay.\n\nMost reviewers acclaimed the track as one of the highlights of \"Don't Believe the Truth\", which itself was widely praised as a marked return to form. The band mentioned in interviews in June 2005 that it would become the second single. The B-sides are Liam Gallagher's \"Pass Me Down the Wine\" and Gem Archer's \"The Quiet Ones\".\n\nThe song debuted at No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart, but was knocked off the spot the following week by Gorillaz's new single \"Dare\". \"Q\" magazine readers placed the song at number one in a list of 2005's greatest tracks.\n\nThe song was ranked No. 117 in XFM's 1000 Greatest Songs of All Time list. XFM also placed it at No. 48 in their 100 Best Songs of The 2000s list. The song is included on Oasis' compilation albums \"Stop the Clocks\" and \"Time Flies... 1994–2009\".\n\nThe promo film was directed by Dawn Shadforth, whose previous videos include Kylie Minogue's award-winning \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\". Shadforth's film for \"The Importance of Being Idle\" starred Welsh actor Rhys Ifans and pays homage to the style of early 1960s kitchen sink drama British films, and is set during preparations for a funeral procession in a northern town, with the extravagant undertakers parading the coffin at the video's climax and Ifans playing the part of a high-kicking funeral director whose own funeral it is.\n\nThe video is based on the film and play \"Billy Liar\" with Ifans playing the role of Billy. The Gallaghers play Shadrack & Duxbury, the owners of the funeral parlour where Billy works. The rest of the band (Gem, Andy and Zak) make brief appearances as lazy workers playing cards in an undertaker's office. The video is similar in style and concept to the black and white 1966 music video for \"Dead End Street\" by The Kinks. Liam Gallagher's second child, Lennon, cameos in this video.\n\nA short behind-the-scenes documentary of the making of the music video, which was shot partly in Greenwich, was directed by Dick Carruthers. Archer describes it as \"the best video I think we've ever done\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Nicknamed \"Nine-Tattoo Dragon\", he ranks 23rd among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nThe only child of Squire Shi, headman of the Shi Family Village in Huayin County (in present-day Shaanxi province), Shi Jin is very passionate about martial arts since childhood that his father keeps looking for better instructors to train him. To look awesome, he even has nine dragons tattooed on his body, which earn him the nickname \"Nine-Tattoo Dragon\".\n\nShi Jin is the first of the 108 Stars of Destiny to appear in the novel. He is practising with a staff in his house's courtyard when Wang Jin, an instructor of the imperial guards in the imperial capital Dongjing, walks in. Wang is temporarily putting up in the Shi household with his mother. They are fleeing to Weizhou and have by chance come to the Shi manor, where they are offered free lodgings for a night by the kindly Squire Shi. But the mother fell ill and the stay has to be extended. Wang has secretly left Dongjing in fear of revenge from his new boss Grand Marshal Gao Qiu. Gao was once beaten by Wang's father in a row at a time when Gao was still a commoner.\n\nFinding Shi Jin's fighting skill wanting, Wang makes a frank comment which the young man overhears. Stung and ignoring his father's objection, Shi Jin challenges Wang to a fight. He is easily beaten by Wang. Humbled, Shi Jin apologises to the instructor and asks him to be his teacher.\n\nWang Jin coaches Shi Jin for some time before continuing his journey to Weizhou. Shi Jin becomes headman of Shi Family Village after his father died.\n\nChen Da, one of the three bandit chiefs on Mount Shaohua (少華山; southeast of present-day Hua County, Shaanxi), comes by Shi Family Village with his men on the way to plunder the well-stocked Huayin County for food. Shi Jin blocks his path and captures him in a one-on-one fight on horseback. When told the news, the other two chiefs, Zhu Wu and Yang Chun, come to the village to beg Shi Jin to arrest them as well so that they can fulfill their oath to die together. Moved by their bond, Shi Jin frees Chen and becomes a friend of the three. Henceforth, the two sides often exchange gifts and hold feast for each other.\n\nOne day, a servant of Shi Jin, when returning from an errand to invite the bandit chiefs to a feast at his master's house, loses the reply letter of the outlaws after getting drunk and falling asleep in a grove. The letter is taken away by a hunter who submits it to the authorities. Soldiers are sent to Shi Jin's house to arrest the bunch on the night of the feast.\n\nFinding his manor surrounded, Shi Jin burns it down and fights his way out with the bandit chiefs. They make it to Mount Shaohua, where Shi Jin declines Zhu Wu's plea that he be their chief. He leaves for Weizhou to look for Wang Jin.\n\nIn Weizhou (渭州; around present-day Pingliang, Gansu), Shi Jin could not find his teacher but meets and befriends Lu Da, a local garrison officer. Later, as he wonders aimlessly and resorts to robbery to obtain money, he runs into Lu Da again, who by then has become a monk with the Buddhist name Lu Zhishen to conceal his identity as he had killed a bully. The two together defeat and kill a monk and a priest who enslaves the monks of a temple and holds a woman in captivity.\n\nShi Jin returns to Mount Shaohua and is made its chief. One day he learns that Prefect He, the governor of Hua prefecture, or Huazhou, has abducted the daughter of a painter to force her to be his concubine . Shi sneaks into the prefect's house to save the woman but is captured. \n\nThe news riles Lu Zhishen, who has come to invite Shi Jin to join Liangshan. He rushes to Huazhou alone to rescue Shi. But He spots him behaving strangely in a crowd as he contemplates assassination seeing the official appearing in public with his guards. Prefect He lures Lu to come with him to his office where the monk too is seized. Mount Shaohua turns to Liangshan for help, which promptly sends a force led by Song Jiang. Posing as imperial officials sent by the Song court to pray at the hallowed Mount Hua, the Liangshan team commands Prefect He to come out of the city to meet them. As soon as He turns up, the outlaws kill him. They then enter the city to free Shi Jin and Lu Zhishen.

He first taught in southern Italy for two years, both in a high school and at the local university, and then went to Sweden for a year as an English language teacher. His next move was as an Assistant Lecturer at the University of Libya from 1963-65. After a year studying for an advanced diploma in linguistics and English language teaching at the University of Leeds, UK he returned to Libya as Head of the English Section at the College of Engineering in Tripoli. After three more years at the Leeds Institute of Education, he returned to the Middle East, this time to the prestigious University of Khartoum, Sudan, where he was Director of the English Language Servicing Unit from 1973-1978. He returned to the UK in 1978 as a senior lecturer (later reader) in the Language Studies Unit at the University of Aston, where he jointly developed the first master’s course in the teaching of English for Specific Purposes.\n\nIn 1985 he moved to the University of Michigan on a visiting position and in 1987 was appointed Professor of Linguistics and Director of the English Language Institute from 1985 to 2001.

He is best known for being the bass player of Mudvayne. He was active with Mudvayne from 1996 until their indefinite hiatus in 2010.\n\nMartinie was raised in a Christian non-denominational church in Illinois, where his grandfather was one of the choir leaders. Therefore, he was exposed to hymns, orchestral music, and other forms of non-secular music. His father also played guitar, piano, and \"has a nice voice that he has good control over.\" When asked why he decided to play bass, he said, \"Why I requested the purchase of a bass is really still a mystery to me. I can only articulate that I remember being drawn by the sense of connection it shared with all of the other instruments.\" He studied jazz bass and won several high school awards for classical vocals. Some of his early influences include Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and several big band jazz groups. He was in a Dream Theater styled progressive rock band called Broken Altar.\n\nIn 1996, Mudvayne was formed. They initially had a different bass player, Shawn Barclay. In 1997, still with Shawn as their bass player, Mudvayne released their first EP, \"Kill, I Oughta\". However, in 1998, after seeing Broken Altar live, Mudvayne asked Martinie to join their band. Although he was initially reluctant to part ways with Broken Altar, he joined Mudvayne upon realizing that they were serious about their band. Martinie became a cult bass player, receiving positive critical acclaim for his unique and technical style of playing, that \"adds Mudvayne a whole new dimension\".\n\nMartinie was the guest bassist on a project created by guitarist and vocalist Scott Von Heldt named \"Kurai\". The drummer for the project was found in Abel Vallejo, the drum tech for Korn. The group released their debut EP, \"Breaking The Broken\" on the 17th of December, 2013.\n\nIn 2015, Martinie began playing with a jazz fusion / progressive rock trio Soften The Glare They recorded their first album Making Faces which was released on September 1, 2017.\n\nMartinie has a \"not yet defined\" side project that he intends to materialize, saying \"People are going to have to see my ugly mug again whether you want to or not. For me this is a great time for me to woodshed and to gather my ideas. To spend a lot of time reading and exposing myself to lots of different types of thought. Fiction and non-fiction. I’m definitely not sitting here idle. There is a lot going on it’s just whether these things end up being Mudvayne things or other things I’m not going to worry about what ends up being what or where it goes\". He said that his playing style will differ from that which was heard in Mudvayne. On 2 August 2012, Korn announced that Ryan Martinie will join them on their European tour that kicked off in Poland, as the band's bassist. Korn bassist Fieldy and his wife, were expecting a child.\n\nMartinie utilizes many techniques to make the instrumental edge of the band even more rich. His bass playing is a key part of Mudvayne's sound. This is particularly emphasized on the song \"A Key to Nothing\" from \"The End of All Things to Come\", which he played with a fretless bass. He does not use any effect pedals, preferring a clean, natural sound from his bass. He stated, \"I like the natural approach to playing, and I'm not exactly – I'm not a purist, I mean, go for it. If you like synth bass, octave pedals and stuff, then utilize it. I'm not against any of that stuff, but I do like to find those things with my hands.\"\n\nMartinie is known for pushing the envelope that most metal bassists limit themselves to. His right hand is one of the major reasons for this, as he pulls from many different techniques and genres. He is known for flicks (found throughout his music) and a flamenco style, notable on \"Dull Boy\" and the chorus of \"Out To Pasture\" in some way. On the chorus of \"Out To Pasture\", he does a \"fast flamenco guitar-picking pattern that's as fast as my hand can possibly play. It's just this [extremely] fast pattern, and it's a sleeper, because it sounds like I'm playing single-notes almost, or chords, like I'm strumming chords, but really what's going on there is something completely different. It's the only thing you didn't mention, which makes me really proud, because it's supposed to be transparent, which is maybe one of the most important things that has come to me – in playing and in relating to the other instruments and in particular my band.\" He has a unique heavy fingering technique from which he gets the percussive tone and the sharper, more extreme attack from his bass. He also uses slapping and popping techniques on the most of the \"L.D. 50\" album, most notably on the songs like \"Dig\".\nMartinie has developed his own tapping technique on the neck where he uses his index and middle fingers to tap an octave chord, usually high on the neck, while his left hand moves notes, doublestops or chords. This is very similar to a technique used by John Entwistle. On the album \"Mudvayne\", he also plays complex bass parts in the intros of \"Beautiful And Strange\" and \"I Can't Wait\".\n\nMartinie is known as a precise player. Even when playing his Pedulla fretless he uses quick movements and jogs up and down the neck. Martinie tends to accentuate his work with thick low end, double stops, and chords that add warmth or awkward tension (\"Pharmaecopia\", \"World So Cold\" and \"Not Falling\"). He uses harmonics that add a bright sound to his variety of styles, such as the intro to \"Death Blooms\" and \"Out To Pasture\". On his unique tapping technique, he stated: \"I’m not a pedal guy, but I like the sound that people get from octave pedals. So, to organically create that effect, I used my right-hand middle and index fingers to tap two strings at once: I come down on the strings fairly hard so they actually bounce off of the neck. That way I create some top-end click, but I retain the tonality. At the same time, I use my left hand to hold and/or move the octave. I can do it in walking form, single-note form, or whatever. The whole chorus of “Happy?” uses that technique.\"\n\nNot much is known about Martinie's personal life. He resides in Mebane, North Carolina. Martinie is known as a passionate reader. Some of his favorite musical artists include The Beatles, John Patitucci, Chick Corea, King Crimson, Death, Meshuggah, and Mastodon.\n\nMartinie is a Warwick endorser. He owns a wide variety of Warwick Thumb Neck-Through basses, which he exclusively plays. On several occasions he has been seen playing a Warwick Streamer Stage II and a Warwick Corvette Standard. \n\nMartinie uses Hi-Beams Black Beauty DR strings (.045-.105/.135).\n\nMartinie primarily used Ampeg SVT Pro amplifiers until \"The New Game\" was released, at which time he switched to Warwick amplification. He currently uses the Warwick Xtreme 10.1 Amp Head and four Warwick WCA 411 Pro cabinets. He is also known for slaving Greg Tribbett's guitar cabinets during live shows. He uses Avalon DI's for live shows and in studio.\n\nStudio albums \n\n\n\n\n"}

Birds which breed further south in Argentina and Uruguay migrate to Bolivia and southern Brazil, (the cerrado etc.), in the austral winter. There are also isolated populations in Central America and Mexico. It was discovered on Trinidad in 2004, presumably having colonised from nearby Venezuela. Also known from Barbados, certainly since 1960 if not earlier.\n\nThe grassland yellow finch, as its name implies, is found in fields and other open grassland. The female lays 3 brown-speckled pale blue-green eggs in a grassy cup nest in tall grass, and several pairs may breed close to each other in suitable areas.\n\nThe grassland yellow finch is about 12 cm long and weighs 13 g. The males have bright yellow underparts and rump, and olive yellow upperparts. The crown and nape have dark streaking, and there is yellow around the eye. Females have dark-streaked pale brown upperparts and dull yellow underparts. The call is a sharp \"te-tsip\", and the male's song, given from a perch or in a display flight, is a series of chips, buzzes and trills.\n\nGrassland yellow finches eat seeds and insects, and are usually seen in pairs or small groups.\n\n\n"}

The re-release includes new artwork, an expanded booklet, and several bonus tracks including demos and live versions featuring then-lead vocalist Luke Easter.\n\nThe band recorded \"Stop the Bleeding\" at Mixing Lab A & B studio in Garden Grove, California. The band's line-up consisted of Ted Kirkpatrick, Guy Ritter, and Gary Lenaire. Session musician Mark Lewis played nearly half of the album's lead guitar solos.\n\nPrior to the album's recording, during an \"Artists vs. Label\" softball game, a label executive accidentally ran over drummer Ted Kirkpatrick's foot (his main kick foot) while rounding second base, requiring Kirkpatrick to record the album under a great deal of pain.\n\nThe band faced other recording obstacles as well, such a power failure that forced the producer to mix the songs over again. In an interview, then-vocalist Guy Ritter reminisced:\n\nIn the original booklet, the band gave co-production credits to Roger Martinez, vocalist of fellow California-based Christian thrash metal group Vengeance Rising. However, Metal Blade Records' Bill Metoyer actually produced the album. Ritter said about this:\n\nMusically, the album was said to be \"unlike anything else on the market at the time\" and incorporates classical music to 1980s-inspired speed and thrash metal riffs. Guy Ritter's vocals on the album, which he said were inspired by glam metal vocalists, shift between low-baritone and high-falsetto vocals, although they were performed higher on the demo versions:\n\nRitter's falsetto vocals are often compared to those of King Diamond:\n\nThe album cover art features a snake restrained by chains, representing the power good has over evil and how that relates to the death and resurrection of Christ, which was the ultimate victory over Satan. The bible verse 1 John 4:4, which reads in part, \"Greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world,\" inspired this concept.\n\nThe song \"You Get What You Pray For\" was the band's first single and charted quite well. It was also a GMA Dove Award nominee for \"Metal Recorded Song of the Year.\"\n\nThe band's controversial video for \"Ark of Suffering,\" which contains graphic footage of animals in laboratories and slaughterhouses and appears on the band's \"Ocular Digital\" DVD, received airplay on MTV before the channel ceased airing it after complaints that it was too graphic. Despite MTV's ban, the video won the Christian News Forum Contemporary Christian Music Award for \"Rock Video of the Year,\" and \"Heaven's Metal\" magazine readers voted it their \"Favorite Video of the Year.\"\n\nAbout the song's airplay, Ritter said:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was once navigable for approximately 50 miles (80 km) of its length, from the Mississippi River, by Durand, northeast to Eau Claire. Its catchment defines a portion of the northern boundary of the Driftless Area. The river is easily accessible for bikers and pleasure seekers via the Chippewa River State Trail which follows the river from Eau Claire to Durand.\n\nThe river is formed by the confluence of the West Fork Chippewa River, which rises at Chippewa Lake in southeastern Bayfield County, and the East Fork Chippewa River, which rises in the swamps of the southern part of the Town of Knight in Iron County, Wisconsin. The rivers' confluence is at Lake Chippewa, a reservoir in central Sawyer County, which is the official \"beginning\" of the Chippewa River.\n\nThe river flows from Sawyer County through Rusk, Chippewa, Eau Claire, Dunn, Pepin and Buffalo Counties, in Wisconsin, before emptying out into the Mississippi River. Sediment build-up at the river's mouth forms a delta that protrudes into the Mississippi, creating Lake Pepin in the process. Along the last of its course, the main channel forms the county boundary between Pepin and Buffalo Counties.\n\nMajor lakes along the river's route include the Radisson and Holcombe Flowages, Lake Wissota and Dell's Pond, all of which are reservoirs. The largest reservoir by far is the Chippewa Flowage, which is the 3rd largest lake in Wisconsin.\n\nThe river's primary tributaries include the Couderay, Thornapple, Flambeau, Brunet, Jump, Fisher, Yellow, Eau Claire, Red Cedar and Eau Galle Rivers.\n\nThe river's confluence with the Red Cedar is just north of the Driftless Zone, at which point its floodplain widens out considerably, and includes numerous riverine islands.\n\nThe primary settlements along the river's course include Cornell, Chippewa Falls, Eau Claire, and Durand.\n\nHistorically, the Chippewa River was important as a floatway for lumbering and papermaking.\n\nThe river has a deep wide canyon, likely due to larger water discharges during Laurentide Ice Sheet retreat.\n\nChippewa River Bottoms is located along the river.\n\nThe 1742 \"Carte de la Louisiane et du Cours du Mississipi\" as \"\"Rivière de bon Secours\" ou \"Hahatonouadeba\"\", and then in the 1757 edition of the Mitchell Map as \"\"Hahatonadeba River\"\", the maps show the transliteration of the Dakota language name for the river \"Ḣaḣatuŋ[waŋ W]atpa\". The word \"Chippewa\" is a rendering of \"Ojibwe.\" The Ojibwe people controlled most of the upper Chippewa Valley and its tributaries until the Treaty of St. Peters in 1837.\n\nOf the pine forests in Wisconsin in the 1800s, the Chippewa River system held more than even the Wisconsin River. It is estimated that the Chippewa system drained 34% of Wisconsin's pineries, as compared to 21% for the Wisconsin, 14% for the St. Croix, and 7% for the Black. Before logging, the Chippewa Valley probably held about 46,000,000,000 board feet of lumber. Frederick Weyerhaeuser described it as \"a logger's paradise, a very large part of its area being heavily forested with the finest quality of white pine timber, while rivers, streams, and lakes offered an excellent network of transportation facilities.\"\n\nThe first sawmill in the Chippewa Valley was probably functioning at what would become Menomonie around 1831. By 1840 Jean Brunet and associates were sawing wood at Chippewa Falls. Floods destroyed these early mills, and the lumbermen rebuilt them. In the late 1800s, Chippewa Falls was said to have the largest sawmill under one roof in the world.\n\nBy the 1850s the loggers were binding the sawed pine lumber into rafts which were guided down the lower Chippewa to markets on the Mississippi. Above Chippewa Falls, though, the river was too rough and rocky for large rafts. Masses of individual logs were driven down by log drivers, sometimes called \"river pigs.\" To make the drives more efficient and reliable, the loggers changed the river somewhat, dynamiting troublesome rocks, cutting trees that would snag logs, building up the banks in places, and damming the river and its tributaries. Around 1876 a dam and log-sorting works was built between Eau Claire and Chippewa Falls. In 1878 a large splash dam was built at Little Falls (modern Holcombe), with so much capacity that when fully opened it could raise the Chippewa three feet 100 miles downstream. Over the Chippewa and its tributaries the loggers built at least 148 logging dams, of various sizes and purposes.\n\nThe Chippewa River is a popular destination for recreational kayakers and canoers. Paddlers experience a variety of conditions on the river, from calm, slow-moving water to small rapids and whitewater. Fishing is a popular activity: the river is known for musky, smallmouth bass, walleye, and northern pike.\n\n\n"}

She was the first woman to be Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives. Up until the election of Anna Burke on 9 October 2012, she was the only female Speaker of the lower house.\n\nGloria Joan Liles Olle was born in Yackandandah, Victoria in 1921, daughter of Warren Olle, a postmaster, and his wife Hilda née Seedsman. She attended Camberwell Girls Grammar School. She married Hal Child, a business manager who was dismissed for stealing while working in Tasmania; but he died suddenly in the mid-1960s, leaving her a widow with five sons (Peter, Andrew, Geoff, Gary and Roger) to raise, the eldest of them 17 years old and the youngest only seven. To keep the family fed and clothed, she worked in factories, shops, as a cleaner and as a cook. When the youngest boy left school, she joined the entourage of future Deputy Prime Minister Jim Cairns, first as a campaign volunteer and then as a liaison officer.\n\nA member of the Australian Labor Party, Child was elected to the House for the seat of Henty, in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, in 1974, having narrowly failed to win the seat in 1972. She was the first female Labor member of the House, and only the fourth woman elected to the House in its history. After less than two years, she was defeated in the landslide Liberal victory in 1975. Her attempt to regain the seat in 1977 failed, but she won it back in 1980 and continued to hold it until her retirement in 1990.\n\nDuring the second term of Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke, Child became Speaker on 11 February 1986 as the sole nominee of the ALP, and was elected by 78 votes to 64 over her opponent, Allan Rocher. She was re-elected Speaker after the 1987 election, winning against Don Dobie. She was liked and respected by MPs from both sides of the Chamber, but she found the notorious rowdyism of Australian parliamentary conduct difficult to deal with, and her health suffered under the strain. In August 1989 she resigned from the role.\n\nAmong the most notable events of her term in office was when the Provisional Parliament House was closed and the new Parliament House was opened in June 1988. Some discussion took place as to whether the old Speaker's Chair, which had been a gift from the Parliament of the United Kingdom, should be installed in the new building; but Child, as Speaker, refused to move the chair. She left the House of Representatives at the 1990 election, when the seat of Henty was abolished.\n\nIn the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 1990, Child was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia. She enjoyed an active retirement, her activities including membership of the Patrons' Council of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria. In February 2013, aged 91, she died. A state funeral was held on 5 March.\n\n"}

The Paspahegh Indian tribe lived in present-day Charles City and James City counties, Virginia. The Powhatan tribes were a group of Native Americans who spoke a branch of Algonquian language.\n\nThe Paspehegh sub-tribe was among the earliest to have interaction with the English colonists, who established their first permanent settlement in the Virginia Colony at Jamestown in their territory, beginning on May 14, 1607. Because of conflict with the English and likely exposure to infectious diseases, they appear to have been destroyed as a tribe by early 1611 and disappeared from the historical record.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the organization of Native Americans of the United States in the Tidewater Region of Virginia has often been mischaracterized by historians as the \"Powhatan Confederacy.\" This group of allied Algonquian tribes was not, in fact, a confederacy, which is more or less a unification of entities which are superior in self-governance to the central point of power. Chief Powhatan's organization is more accurately described by anthropologists as a chiefdom, and he (as well as his several successors) were clearly the central ruler. During the period from 1607 until his death in 1618, these Native Americans are most correctly described as being of Powhatan's \"paramount chiefdom.\"\n\n\n\n\nthe remaining troops were reduced to skin and bones. They were so desperate for food that they resorted to cannibalism of those who died. Sir Thomas Gates then arrives with more colonists, provisions, and orders from King James to \"christianize\" the Indians. Gate's fleet, also widely known in later times as the Third Supply Mission, had left England a year earlier, but become lost in a hurricane. Gates instead decided to evacuate the colony, and their fort at Jamestown was abandoned. Gates saw the condition of the men and saw that they were in no condition physically or mentally to endure anymore.\n\n\nThe original capital of the Paspahegh Indians, present-day Sandy Point in Charles City County, was settled by the English in 1617, who called it Smith's Hundred. After 1619, they renamed it Southampton Hundred. St. Mary's Anglican Church was established there prior to the Powhatan Uprising of 1622. The English later called this series of surprise attacks the Indian Massacre of 1622.\n\nAn archaeological site, known as Paspahegh or Site 44JC308, is under study near Jamestown, Virginia. First identified in 1983 by surveyors from the College of William and Mary, it is one of only a few archeological sites in the state that date to the Early Contact Period. It is located above the English fort at Jamestown. The James River Institute for Archeology (JRIA) conducted collections from a site when it was threatened with development. More concentrated work was done in an area of . The site has remains of houses, mortuary structures, kings houses, and other elements of the village, including ceramics and copper items.\n\nAnalysis of the site showed the rise in copper exchange and then its decline. The English quickly realized how highly the Powhatan peoples valued copper. As the English brought more copper into the colony over a nearly 20-year period, its value declined, and it never recovered what it had been at the time of English arrival. Copper was the most important metal in the Powhatan Confederacy, where it was a mark in life and death of the social hierarchy. The elite were buried with copper items to secure them passage in the spiritual world.\n\nThe fact that the English would trade copper enabled Chief Powhatan to free his people from relations with hostile Monacan and other tribes to the west. Similarly, the English hoped to use their colony to free themselves of dependence on other European nations for certain goods. The rapid abundance of the metal, however, led to its devaluation.\n\nOther Paspahegh villages were located on the south bank of the Chickahominy River and on the north bank of the James River in Charles City County.\n"}

The church consists of two wings that are situated at a right angle.

Then he became one of the artists from the Youths Club in Radio Cartago, in which he made his first appearances as a singer. In 1966 he arrived to Bogotá searching for an opportunity. There he became a regular performer at the Club del Clan TV Show, where his name was changed to Billy. At 14 he signed a contract with the Grill El Caracol Rojo as lead vocalist.\n\nAfter that he started working with the Tropibomba Orchestra. In early 1971 he toured the Americas, with Colombian folk singer Luis Ariel Rey. The same year he started working for the \"Miramar\" club. There he met Pacheco, a famous Colombian TV show host. Billy suggested to Pacheco using the last name Pontoni in honor of singer Rocky Pontoni and he agreed. Pacheco then introduced him as local idol Billy Pontoni at several TV shows.\n\nIn 1978 the singer was selected by RCN to represent Colombia in the seventh edition of the OTI Festival, which was held in Santiago, Chile. Although his song \"joven\" (Young) ended second to last, his career went on successfully.\n\nBecause of the surprising reception, CBS (now known as Sony Music) signed him as an exclusive artist. Since then he has released many hits in several musical styles: \"Alguien cantó una canción\", \"Dime qué pasó\", \"Por qué ahora\", \"Borra\", \"Luna Roja\", \"I like mena\", \"Angélica\", \"retarda\", \"Cómo hacerle entender que la amo\", \"Tu Complemento\" and many more.\n\nPontoni has gotten many gold records and international prizes.

Known as Naresh Ranjan Roy Choudhury in his pre-monastic days, he joined the Ramakrishna Order at its centre in Bhubaneswar in January 1939 at the age of 22. He received initiation (mantra diksha) in 1939, brahmacharya in 1944 with the name 'Amrita-chaitanya' and Sannyasa from Swami Virajananda Maharaj, the then-President of the Order. He was greatly influenced by the dedicated lives of some of the monks of Ramakrishna Order, especially Swami Prabhananda (Ketaki Maharaj), who was his cousin in his pre-monastic life. He had also once met Swami Abhedananda, a direct disciple of Ramakrishna. He served at the Advaita Ashrama, Kolkata, from 1942 to 1952 and at Shillong centre from 1953 to 1958.\n\nFrom 1953 to 1958, he was in Shillong centre, where he worked under the guidance of Swami Saumyanandaji Maharaj. During this period he also organized flood relief operations in Assam a couple of times. Keenly interested in service to sick and suffering people, he was posted to the Mission's hospital centre, Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan, Kolkata, in 1958. There he worked during the first 5 years as its Assistant Secretary under Swami Dayanandaji and then as its head for 22 years. He worked to develop the services of Seva Pratishthan to cater to the medical needs of more and more people belonging to poor and low-income sections of the society and converted the original small maternity hospital into a 550-bed, modern, well-equipped hospital.\nHe was elected a trustee of the Ramakrishna Math and Member of the Governing Body of the Ramakrishna Mission in 1965. In 1979, he was appointed an Assistant Secretary of the twin organizations. He became the General Secretary of the Math and Mission in 1989 and continued in that post for 3 years till 1992 when he became a Vice-President of the Order. In 1993, he represented the Ramakrishna Order at the commemorative function organized by Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago (and attended by 6500 people from all parts of the world) to celebrate the centenary of Swami Vivekananda's historic appearance at the World Parliament of Religions. From 1992, he was also simultaneously the head of Ramakrishna Math (Yogodyan) at Kankurgachhi, Kolkata.\n\nAs a Vice-President of the Math and Mission, Swami Gahananandaji travelled extensively in various parts of the country and visited many branches of the Order. He also visited at different times various places in USA, Canada, England, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Russia, Australia, Japan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Singapore, Malaysia and Mauritius. In all these places, he spread the message of Vedanta and Ramakrishna, Sarada Devi and Vivekananda.\n\nGahanananda was elected the president of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission in May 2005.\n\nHe died on Sunday, 4 November 2007 at 5.35 pm after a prolonged illness. He had been admitted to the Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan hospital in Kolkata on 4 September.\n\nThousands of devotees queued up to pay their last respects at Sanskriti Bhavan at Belur Math, where his body was kept after his death. The gates of the Math were kept open throughout the night and following day, until the completion of the last rites. The President of India condoled his death.\n\nIn the year 1932, with the aim of providing adequate health care to pregnant women and infants, a hospital known as \"Shishu Mangal Pratishthan\" came to be established in a small tin shed, by the efforts of Swami Dayanandaji. In this institution, holding fast to the ideals placed by Dayananda and placing himself under his guidance, Gahanananda shaped himself between 1958 and 1963. Keeping the lofty ideal of \"service to humanity in the spirit of worship of God\" bright before him, he set on a new spiritual journey. From 1958 to 1985, for 27 years, he was involved in the activities of the institution. It was owing to his efforts that \"Shishu Mangal Pratishthan\" developed into a full-fledged general hospital known as \"Seva Pratishthan\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2049265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049265", "title": "Identity documents in the United States", "text": "Identity documents in the United States\n\nIdentity documents in the United States are typically the regional state-issued driver's license or identity card, while also the Social Security card (or just the Social Security number) and the United States Passport Card may serve as national identification. The United States passport itself also may serve as identification. However there is no official \"national identity card\" in the United States, in the sense that there is no federal agency with nationwide jurisdiction that directly issues an identity document to all US citizens for mandatory regular use.\n\nThere have been proposals to nationalize ID cards, as currently citizens are identified by a patchwork of documents issued by both the federal government as well as individual state and local governments.\n\nIt is both a political issue and a practical one, and the idea of federalism is cited as supporting federated (regional) identification. All legislative attempts to create a national identity card have failed due to tenacious opposition from liberal and conservative politicians alike, who regard the national identity card as the mark of a totalitarian society.\n\nAt present, the only national photo identity documents are the passport and passport card, which are issued by the U.S. Department of State to U.S. nationals only upon voluntary application. Issuance of these documents is discretionary - that is, for various reasons, the State Department can refuse an application for a passport or passport card.\n\nThe driver's license, which is issued by each individual state, operates as the \"de facto\" national identity card due to the ubiquity of driving in the United States. Each state also issues a non-driver state identity card which fulfills the same identification functions as the driver's license, but does not permit the operation of a motor vehicle.\n\nSocial Security cards have federal jurisdiction but cannot verify identity. They verify only the match between a given name and a Social Security Number (SSN) and were intended only for use in complying with Social Security payroll tax laws. They now are used in a wider scope of activities, such as for obtaining credit and other regulated financial services in banking and investments.\n\nThe birth certificate is the initial identification document issued to parents shortly after the birth of their child. The birth certificate is typically issued by local governments, usually the city or county where a child is born. It is an important record, often called a \"feeder document,\" because it establishes U.S. citizenship through birthright citizenship, which is then used to obtain, or is the basis for, all other identity documents. By itself, the birth certificate is usually only considered proof of citizenship but not proof of identity, since it is issued without a photograph at birth, containing no identifying features. A birth certificate is normally produced along with proof of identity, such as a driver's license or the testimony of a third party (such as a parent), to establish identity or entitlement to a service.\n\nA child born abroad to two U.S. citizen parents, or one citizen parent and one non-citizen, also typically has citizenship from birth. Such births are registered with the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. If the embassy or consulate determines the child acquired citizenship at birth, it issues a Consular Report of Birth Abroad, also known as Form FS-240. A birth certificate will also be issued locally in the country where the child was born. The consular report is proof of U.S. citizenship and may be used to obtain a passport for the child and register the child for school, among other purposes.\n\nThe Social Security number (SSN) and card are issued by the Social Security Administration. Almost all parents voluntarily apply for a Social Security number shortly after the birth of a child. In the absence of a national identity card (and concordant national identity number), the Social Security number has become the \"de facto\" national identifier for a large variety of purposes, both governmental and non-governmental.\n\nThe SSN was created to ensure accurate reporting of a worker's wages to the Social Security Administration. Prior to 1986, it was common to apply for a SSN shortly before it might be needed, most often when a teenager. Tax reform acts of 1986, 1988, and 1990 required parents to supply the SSN of children over age 5, 2, or 1 respectively, to receive an income tax deduction for the child. This led to parents applying for their children's SSN at birth.\n\nBecause their original purpose was so limited, Social Security cards were not designed with the rigorous security measures typically expected of identity documents. They do not have a photograph or physical description of the bearer, nor are they required to be renewed. Therefore, the Social Security card is not usually considered proof of identity, only proof that the person named on the card holds the number indicated on the card. It is normally used in conjunction with other documents, such as a photo ID, to prove that the person holding the card is legally present in the U.S. and has the right to work in the U.S. (unless the card is marked with a restriction).\n\nMany organizations, universities, and corporations historically used SSNs to uniquely identify their customer or student populations. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, also known as the Buckley Amendment, required changes that eliminated the use of the SSN as an identifier for a student. Educational institutions now request the SSN at first contact as required by other federal laws and assign their own unique number to each person to maintain the individual’s privacy as required. Other laws require the SSN be associated with interest-bearing accounts, interest-paying loans, most public assistance programs, and state-issued identification, e.g. driver’s licenses. To reduce the incidence of identity theft, several states have passed laws that require institutions using the SSN to assign their own identifier numbers to individuals, and prohibit them from using the SSN as a primary key.\n\nA driver's license is issued by each state's DMV, which is required to drive. Each state's DMV can also issue a state identification card. It does not contain any endorsements to operate vehicles and can be used as official identification where asked for or needed.\n\nIn addition to verifying driving privileges, drivers' licenses are used to purchase automobile insurance or during a police traffic stop and serve as the primary form of identity for American adults. They are widely used by both government entities and private businesses to verify identity or age, such as in entering secure government facilities, boarding a commercial airliner, business transactions, or in the purchase of age-restricted items such as alcoholic beverages or cigarettes.\n\nDrivers' licenses issued in any state are recognized as valid identity documents in all other states under a variety of legal principles like comity and the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. However, if a person permanently moves to another state as a resident, state laws usually give a period of time, such as 60 days, in which a person must surrender his out-of-state license for the license of his new home state.\n\nDriver's licenses include a gender marker, typically either \"M\" or \"F\". This has been changing in the early 21st century. As of September 2019, at least 14 states and the District of Columbia offer a third, gender-neutral option beyond \"male\" and \"female\" to serve people with nonbinary gender identities.\n\nAlthough most American adults carry their drivers' licenses at all times when they are outside their homes, there is no legal requirement that they must carry their licenses when not operating a vehicle. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that states are permitted to require people to truthfully state their name when a police officer asks them; about half of the states have enacted some variant of stop and identify statutes requiring compliance with such police inquiries. In some states, such as California, failure to produce an identification document upon citation for \"any\" traffic infraction (such as riding a bicycle on the wrong side of a street) is sufficient justification for full custodial arrest.\n\nPrior to 2005, each state designed its own driver's license according to its own standards. In 2005, the U.S. Congress passed a controversial bill known as the REAL ID Act, which established uniform standards for the design and content of state drivers' licenses and delegated authority to the Department of Homeland Security to implement and regulate compliance with the Act. One of the more-controversial aspects of the Act was that it requires all the underlying state databases be linked into a single national database.\n\nUnited States passports are issued by the U.S. Department of State. Applications for passports are most often filed at United States Postal Service offices or local county or municipal clerk's offices. For many years, passports were not required for U.S. citizens to re-enter from countries near the United States (including Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, and most Caribbean and Central American nations.) In light of this, and given the country's immense size and the great distances which the average citizen lives from an international border, passport possession in the United States had remained relatively low. Indeed, most Americans normally did not obtain passports or carry them regularly unless traveling abroad, and as of 2006, only 60 million (20% of Americans) had passports. As of 2011, approximately 37% of Americans have passports or passport cards.\n\nHowever, in response to recommendations in the 9/11 Commission Report, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security now requires proof of citizenship for people entering the United States from neighboring countries. This requirement is known as the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, and was implemented in stages:\n\n\nBy law, an unexpired U.S. passport (or passport card) is conclusive proof of U.S. nationality (though not necessarily citizenship) and has the same force and effect as proof of United States nationality as certificates of naturalization or of citizenship, if issued to a U.S. citizen for the full period allowed by law.\n\nThe main purpose of the U.S. passport card is to provide a more convenient wallet-sized identity and travel document for citizens who want to carry an official federal ID and for those who live near a land border. It can be used for land and sea travel between the U.S. and Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda but cannot be used for other countries or for international air travel. Other than these travel limitations, the passport card carries the same rights and privileges as the passport book. The passport card is also accepted as valid identification for domestic air travel inside the United States.\n\nWhen outside the United States and the above-mentioned countries, the passport card can be used as identification and proof of citizenship \"within\" a particular country, even though it is not valid for \"travel\" internationally (i.e., traveling from Germany to Switzerland/Austria/France/etc.).\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has indicated that the U.S. Passport Card may be used in the Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 (form) process. The passport card is considered a \"List A\" document that may be presented by newly hired employees during the employment eligibility verification process to show work authorized status. \"List A\" documents are those used by employees to prove both identity and work authorization when completing the Form I-9.\n\nMembers of the Military and employees of the Department of Defense receive identity documents based on their status. A Geneva Conventions Identification Card (called a Common Access Card or CAC) is issued to Active Duty and Selected Reserve service members, DOD employees, and some contractors. Adult dependents of service members, retired service members, and members of the Inactive ready reserve receive a different kind of military ID that does not contain the smart card cryptographic chip that the Common Access Card has.\nA DOD identification card number usually matches the holder's Social Security Number. But, on June 1, 2011, the DOD began phasing out use of the SSN to protect service members' identities. It was replaced with a 10-digit DOD ID Number and a 12-digit Benefits ID Number.\n\nIn the absence of a national identity card, the typical adult in the United States often possesses a large number of documents issued by many different public and private entities to prove their identity.\n\nFor citizens who acquire United States citizenship not by virtue of being born in the United States, the federal government issues a Certificate of U.S. Citizenship or Certificate of Naturalization, which are documents that function similarly to a birth certificate. These two documents, along with a U.S. passport, are by law one of the few primary documents for proving U.S. citizenship. These certificates are normally not carried on a day-to-day basis; instead, they are used to procure other documents, such as a passport or driver's license, which are then carried and used as a primary means of identification.\n\nThe federal government also issues a variety of other documents and cards which can be used to establish identity. Immigration and travel documents such as the Green Card or a visa can be used to prove identity and the right to work in the United States (if applicable). Trusted traveler cards are issued by US Customs and Border Protection to indicate participation in the NEXUS, SENTRI, or Global Entry programs used to facilitate expedited entry through customs. Within the marine trades (and supporting trades thereof), the Transportation Worker Identification Credential provides unescorted access to secured port facilitates.\n\nFederal, state, and local governments and agencies typically issue identification cards for their employees. These cards can be used to prove identity outside of the workplace. Although there are varying degrees of acceptance, government workplace identification is generally seen as more trustworthy than workplace identification from a private company. A notable example is the Department of Defense's Common Access Card, which functions as the military's primary ID card.\n\nThere are a variety of secondary documents used to establish identity. However, these documents are typically not accepted as a primary form of identification. They are typically only used to obtain a primary form of identification (usually a driver's license or passport), when other forms of identification have been lost or stolen, or as auxiliary documents in conjunction with a primary form of identification. These other documents include:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2049290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049290", "title": "Skip-Bo", "text": "Skip-Bo\n\nSkip-Bo is a commercial version of the card game Spite and Malice. In 1967, Minnie Hazel \"Skip\" Bowman (1915–2001) of Brownfield, Texas, began producing a boxed edition of the game under the name \"SKIP-BO\". In 1980 the game was purchased by International Games, which was subsequently bought by Mattel in 1992. A mobile version of the game for iOS was released by Magmic in September, 2013.\nThere is a new version called \"SKIP-BO Mod\" that comes in a white and blue case.\n\nThe deck consists of 162 cards, twelve each of the numbers 1 through 12 and eighteen \"SKIP-BO\" wild cards which may be played as any number. Alternatively, the 162 cards could be three regular decks of playing cards, including the jokers, with ace to queen corresponding to 1 to 12 and the kings and jokers corresponding to the SKIP-BO cards. Before 1980, the commercial game consisted of four decks of regular playing cards with eight SKIP-BO cards replacing the standard two jokers in each deck. In addition, the aces, twos and threes in the fourth deck were marked SKIP-BO. The remainder of the fourth deck was discarded.\n\nTwo to four people can play at a time as individuals, or, six or more players in teams (no more than three partnerships). The object of the game is to be the first player or team to play out their entire stock pile(s). The player with the middle age goes first. Each player is dealt 30 cards (recommended 10-15 for faster gameplay) for their pile with only the top card visible, and a hand of five cards, and the remaining cards are placed face down to create a common draw pile. The shared play area allows up to four build piles, which must be started using either a \"1\" card or a Skip-Bo, and each player also has up to four personal discard piles. Each turn the active player draws until they have five cards in hand, though there are cases of not drawing more cards to equal five cards, instead doing a draw of a certain number of cards. They must play either the next card in sequential order or a wild Skip-Bo card, using either cards in hand, the top card of their stock pile, or the top card of any of their four discard piles. If the player can play all five cards from their hand, they draw five more and continue playing. When no more plays are available, the player discards one card to either an empty discard pile or on top of an existing one and play passes to the next player. When a build pile reaches 12, it is removed from the board and that space becomes empty for another pile to be started; play continues until one player has played their final start card. If a card falls on the ground and no one knows who it is the person who is winning chooses who gets it.\n\nFor single rounds, whoever goes out first is the winner. \n\nIf multiple games are going to be played, either track the number of wins for each player or a point system may be used. \n\nFor the points scoring, the winning player receives 25 points for winning plus 5 points for each card in his/her opponents' stock piles. The first player to reach 500 points wins.\n\nAnother option for game play is to pair up players as partners. Game play remains the same except:\n\nSkip-Bo was released in the iTunes App Store and for Android on November 16, 2012 by onestepmobile. The game was later developed by Magmic and is licensed through Mattel.\nVarious electronic handheld versions of Skip-Bo have been released over the years. The mobile version was pulled from the App Store and is no longer in operation as of August 27th 2019 due to Magmic no longer holding the license, much to the dismay of its long time users. No officially sanctioned version of the game currently exists on the app store.\n\nWilliam Henry Storey designed a card game \"\"Starturn\"\" which was published by Chad Valley in 1935. Two packs, 44 very dark gray and 52 stop sign red, are used in a game primarily for two players although there were versions for three or four players. Black cards are divided equally between the players, placed face down with only the top card visible, as the Stack. Five red cards are dealt to each player, made up to five on each pass, and the rest placed as the draw Pack. The aim is to make up to four Build piles starting at 1 through to 15, using cards from the player's Stack where possible. Each player must discard one card at the end of each pass (except when all cards in the hand have been used on Build piles) on to one of four discard piles in front of each player, from which cards may be used (strictly, top card first) in forming Build piles. Completed Build piles are shuffled into the Pack as soon as completed. The first player to use up all his/her Stack cards is the winner. Although the cards are of different design, the rules of Skip-bo are almost exactly the same.\n\n"}
{"id": "2049301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049301", "title": "Idealization (science philosophy)", "text": "Idealization (science philosophy)\n\nIdealization is the process by which scientific models assume facts about the phenomenon being modeled that are strictly false but make models easier to understand or solve. That is, it is determined whether the phenomenon approximates an \"ideal case,\" then the model is applied to make a prediction based on that ideal case.\n\nIf an approximation is accurate, the model will have high predictive accuracy; for example, it is not usually necessary to account for air resistance when determining the acceleration of a falling bowling ball, and doing so would be more complicated. In this case, air resistance is idealized to be zero. Although this is not strictly true, it is a good approximation because its effect is negligible compared to that of gravity.\n\nIdealizations may allow predictions to be made when none otherwise could be. For example, the approximation of air resistance as zero was the only option before the formulation of Stokes' law allowed the calculation of drag forces. Many debates surrounding the usefulness of a particular model are about the appropriateness of different idealizations.\n\nGalileo utilized the concept of idealization in order to formulate the law of free fall. Galileo, in his study of bodies in motion, set up experiments that assumed frictionless surfaces and spheres of perfect roundness. The crudity of ordinary objects has the potential to obscure their mathematical essence, and idealization is used to combat this tendency.\n\nThe most well-known example of idealization in Galileo's experiments is in his analysis of motion. Galileo predicted that if a perfectly round and smooth ball were rolled along a perfectly smooth horizontal plane, there would be nothing to stop the ball (in fact, it would slide instead of roll, because rolling requires friction). This hypothesis is predicated on the assumption that there is no air resistance.\n\nGeometry involves the process of idealization because it studies ideal entities, forms and figures. Perfect circles, spheres, straight lines and angles are abstractions that help us think about and investigate the world.\n\nAn example of the use of idealization in physics is in Boyle's Gas Law:\n\"Given any x and any y, if all the molecules in y are perfectly elastic and spherical, possess equal masses and volumes, have negligible size, and exert no forces on one another except during collisions, then if x is a gas and y is a given mass of x which is trapped in a vessel of variable size and the temperature of y is kept constant, then any decrease of the volume of y increases the pressure of y proportionally, and vice versa.\"\n\nIn physics, people will often solve for Newtonian systems without friction. While we know that friction is present in actual systems, solving the model without friction can provide insights to the behavior of actual systems where the force of friction is negligible.\n\nIt has been argued by the \"Poznań School\" (in Poland) that Karl Marx utilized idealization in the social sciences (see the works written by Leszek Nowak). Similarly, in economic models individuals are assumed to make maximally rational choices. This assumption, although known to be violated by actual humans, can often lead to insights about the behavior of human populations.\n\nIn psychology, idealization refers to a defence mechanism in which a person perceives another to be better (or have more desirable attributes) than would actually be supported by the evidence. This sometimes occurs in child custody conflicts. The child of a single parent frequently may imagine (\"idealize\") the (ideal) absent parent to have those characteristics of a perfect parent. However, the child may find imagination is favorable to reality. Upon meeting that parent, the child may be happy for a while, but disappointed later when learning that the parent does not actually nurture, support and protect as the former caretaker parent had.\n\nA notable proponent of idealization in both the natural sciences and the social sciences was the economist Milton Friedman. In his view, the standard by which we should assess any empirical theory is the accuracy of the predictions that a theory makes. This amounts to an instrumentalist conception of science, including social science. Consistently with this conception, he then argues against the criticism that we should reject an empirical theory if we find that the assumptions of that theory are not realistic, in the sense of being imperfect descriptions of reality. This criticism is wrongheaded, Friedman claims, because the assumptions of any empirical theory are necessarily unrealistic, since such a theory must abstract from the particular details of each instance of the phenomenon that the theory seeks to explain. This leads him to the conclusion that “[t]ruly important and significant hypotheses will be found to have ‘assumptions’ that are wildly inaccurate descriptive representations of reality, and, in general, the more significant the theory, the more unrealistic the assumptions (in this sense).” In this light, he makes the case for seeing the assumptions of neoclassical positive economics as not importantly different from the idealizations that are employed in natural science, drawing a comparison between treating a falling body as if it were falling in a vacuum and viewing firms as if they were rational actors seeking to maximize expected returns.\n\nAgainst this instrumentalist conception, which judges empirical theories on the basis of their predictive success, the social theorist Jon Elster has argued that an explanation in the social sciences is more convincing when it ‘opens the black box’ — that is to say, when the explanation specifies a chain of events leading from the independent variable to the dependent variable. The more detailed this chain, argues Elster, the less likely the explanation specifying that chain is neglecting a hidden variable that could account for both the independent variable and the dependent variable. Relatedly, he also contends that social-scientific explanations should be formulated in terms of causal mechanisms, which he defines as “frequently occurring and easily recognizable causal patterns that are triggered under generally unknown conditions or with indeterminate consequences.” All this informs Elster's disagreement with rational-choice theory in general and Friedman in particular. On Elster's analysis, Friedman is right to argue that criticizing the assumptions of an empirical theory as unrealistic is misguided, but he is mistaken to defend on this basis the value of rational-choice theory in social science (especially economics). Elster presents two reasons for why this is the case: first, because rational-choice theory does not illuminate “a mechanism that brings about non-intentionally the same outcome that a superrational agent could have calculated intentionally”, a mechanism “that would simulate rationality”; and second, because explanations drawing on rational-choice theory do not provide pinpoint predictions, which in certain cases (for instance, he claims, quantum mechanics) would be sufficient to convince one that the theory making these predictions is likely to be true. Accordingly, Elster wonders whether the as-if assumptions of rational-choice theory help explain any social or political phenomenon.\n\nMichael Weisberg has examined these and related questions from the vantage of philosophical reflection on models and idealization. By his lights, we can develop a classification of scientific idealization that picks out three kinds: Galilean idealization, minimalist idealization, and multiple-models idealization. Galilean idealization, in his account, consists in “introducing distortions into models with the goal of simplifying, in order to make them more mathematically or computationally tractable”, whereas minimalist idealization “is the practice of constructing and studying models that include only the core causal factors which give rise to a phenomenon.” Somewhat similar to minimalist idealization is multiple-models idealization, which Weisberg defines as “the practice of building multiple related but incompatible models, each of which makes distinct claims about the nature and causal structure giving rise to a phenomenon.” Further, these kinds of idealization can be differentiated in terms of ‘representational ideals’, which Weisberg sees as “regulat[ing] which factors are to be included in models, set[ting] up the standards theorists use to evaluate their models, and guid[ing] the direction of theoretical inquiry.” Relevant to the debate between Friedman and Elster is the representational ideal of ‘maxout’, according to which the model-builder aims only at maximal predictive accuracy; only this ideal, Weisberg claims, “sanctions black-box models” Moreover, in his view, and contrary to what Friedman's discussion of the law of falling bodies suggests, Galilean idealization has as its aim not ‘maxout’ but, rather, ‘completeness’— viz., providing a complete description of a given phenomenon. Relatedly, Weisberg also finds unsatisfying the ideal of ‘maxout’  as a principle for guiding scientific research, inasmuch as this ideal counsels only the development of predictions, thereby neglecting what Weisberg sees as a central part of the scientific enterprise: “[w]hile scientists want to know how a system will behave in the future, they also want an explanation of why it behaves the way that it does.”\n\nThe philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah has defended the value of as-if idealization more broadly, across the sciences as well as the humanities and for ends other than prediction. In short, he argues that such idealization can aid our understanding of a given phenomenon even when that idealization involves claims about that phenomenon that are false. In support of this contention he draws on the thought of Daniel Dennett\",\"in particular his notion, elaborated in \"The Intentional Stance\", that viewing a system as if it were an intentional agent can better our predictions of that system's behaviour and, moreover, bring to our attention patterns in its behaviour that we would otherwise not notice. But Appiah goes further than this, contending that as-if idealization is an essential feature of several modes of thought. Here, his principal intellectual guide is Hans Vaihinger, whose philosophy he describes in the following way: “[his thought] regards questions concerning our everyday thinking about the world as continuous with our scientific thinking: [b]oth aim, he says, at controlling reality, and both can leave things out in order to make it practicable to represent the world we want to control.” To illustrate his own claims, Appiah describes how the schematic McCulloch-Pitts neuron yielded insights regarding neurophysiology as well as computer science: “a highly idealized model of the brain acquir[ed] independent utility because its simplifying idealizations ended up providing techniques for mimicking the functions rather than the material substrate of the mind.” With respect to social science in particular, Appiah analyses the conception of rationality within rational-choice theory and arrives at the conclusion that this conception assumes perfect computational ability — that is, the ability to process information without error — but is not for that reason useless or inapplicable to the study of human phenomena. In his words:\n\nNo actual agents are computationally perfect, but the states that determine their actual behavior can still be characterized by how they would manifest themselves, given computational perfection. Analogously, the actual velocities of real gas molecules, which explain their less-than-ideal actual behavior, may nevertheless be characterized as the velocities that would, if only gas molecules were perfectly inelastic point masses, produce the ideal gas laws predicted by the simplest version of the kinetic theory of gases. (pp.84-85)\n\nWhile idealization is used extensively by certain scientific disciplines, it has been rejected by others. For instance, Edmund Husserl recognized the importance of idealization but opposed its application to the study of the mind, holding that mental phenomena do not lend themselves to idealization.\n\nAlthough idealization is considered one of the essential elements of modern science, it is nonetheless the source of continued controversy in the literature of the philosophy of science. For example, Nancy Cartwright suggested that Galilean idealization presupposes tendencies or capacities in nature and that this allows for extrapolation beyond what is the ideal case.\n\nThere is continued philosophical concern over how Galileo's idealization method assists in the description of the behavior of individuals or objects in the real world. Since the laws created through idealization (such as the ideal gas law) describe only the behavior of ideal bodies, these laws can only be used to predict the behavior of real bodies when a considerable number of factors have been physically eliminated (e.g. through shielding conditions) or ignored. Laws that account for these factors are usually more complicated and in some cases have not yet been developed.\n\n"}
{"id": "2049323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049323", "title": "Psycho Surgery", "text": "Psycho Surgery\n\nPsycho Surgery is Christian metal band Tourniquet's second album, released originally in 1991 on Intense Records and Metal Blade Records and remastered/re-released in 2001 on Pathogenic Records. The re-release includes revised artwork, an expanded booklet, and several bonus tracks that include demos and live versions featuring then-lead vocalist Luke Easter. Considered by critics to be Tourniquet's most balanced of the band's first three albums, Heaven's Metal fanzine ranked \"Psycho Surgery\" Christian metal's second-best album of all time (after Vengeance Rising's \"Human Sacrifice\"). (Tourniquet retitled the re-release \"Psychosurgery\" as one word rather than two since co-founder and drummer Ted Kirkpatrick always felt that it should have been just one.)\n\nProduced by Metal Blade Records' Bill Metoyer, Tourniquet recorded \"Psycho Surgery\" at Mixing Lab A & B studio in Garden Grove, California. Guitarist Erik Mendez and the bassist Victor Macias joined Tourniquet for this album, forming the quintet known as Tourniquet's classic line-up. After \"Stop the Bleeding\" band caught Metal Blade Records' attention, Metal Blade released the album to the secular market, leaving the Christian market to original label Intense Records.\n\n\"Psycho Surgery\" represented a more modern, experimental, and technical thrash-metal style, leaving behind the previous album's speed metal elements and incorporating classical music-influenced guitar riffs, complex tempo changes, and virtuosic guitar solos. One reviewer described the album as \"Slayer plays Beethoven in a slightly rearranged way.\" Vocalist Guy Ritter also abandoned his King Diamond-like high-pitched falsetto in favor of a more melodic baritone register. \n\nThe album's crisp production creates a somewhat clinical and sterile atmosphere that serves to undergird the album's medical themes. Using his pharmaceutical background, drummer Ted Kirkpatrick infused the lyrics with medical terminology to serve as metaphors for particular social issues such as discrimination of the developmentally delayed (\"Broken Chromosomes\"), heretical sects (\"A Dog's Breakfast\"), and parental neglect (\"Dysfunctional Domicile\"). The song \"Stereotaxic Atrocities,\" a sequel to the previous album's \"Ark of Suffering,\" features a brief reprise of the original's signature guitar riff and criticizes laboratory testing of animals.\n\nTaking advantage of rap metal's new popularity, the album's popular \"Spineless\" featured the vocal and sampling contributions of Christian hip-hop group P.I.D. Although Kirkpatrick wrote most of the song's lyrics prior to entering the studio, P.I.D.'s Fred \"Doug Tray\" Lynch and Barry \"G\" Hogan crafted their own lyrical contributions on the spot. The fast-moving instrumental \"Viento Borrascoso (Devastating Wind)\" features Kirkpatrick's virtuosic drumming. The album's final song, \"Officium Defunctorum,\" is a doom metal piece written by guitarist/vocalist Gary Lenaire that addresses the Jesus Christ's crucifixion.\n\nMetal Blade Records' wide distribution of \"Psycho Surgery\" increased Tourniquet's exposure and popularity. Following the album's release, the songs \"Psycho Surgery,\" \"Spineless,\" and \"Viento Borrascoso\" all achieved number-one positions on several charts, and readers of \"HM Magazine\" voted \"Psycho Surgery\" their \"Favorite Album of the Year\" in 1991. In 1992, \"Psycho Surgery\" also achieved two GMA Dove Award nominations in the categories Metal Album of the Year and Metal Recorded Song of the Year (\"Psycho Surgery\"). Critics consider the album a display of talented musicianship, intelligent lyrics, and originality. In August 2010, \"HM Magazine\" ranked \"Psycho Surgery\" #18 on its list of Top 100 Christian Rock Albums of All Time and the #2 album on its list of Top 100 Christian Metal Albums of All Time. In an interview with Noisecreep about the list, \"HM Magazine\" editor Doug Van Pelt explained that \"Psycho Surgery\" \"found this band playing as a five-member band for the first time and they really bent creativity in metal in new directions that have still not been matched. Nobody has ever sounded like this band. I mean, Between the Buried and Me and maybe System of a Down are the closest in stretching creative boundaries. You almost had to pull out a medical dictionary to understand their [Tourniquet's] lyrics. Standout song would have to be the epic 'Broken Chromosomes,' which is a touching song about mistreated kids that are mentally handicapped.

The format of the show is a one-hour, one-on-one interview with a non-fiction author. The series was broadcast at 8 p.m. Eastern Time each Sunday night, and was the longest-running author interview program in U.S. broadcast history.\n\n\"Booknotes\" debuted on April 2, 1989. The first guest was former United States National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, discussing \"The Grand Failure: The Birth and Death of Communism in the Twentieth Century\". The fifth anniversary was marked on April 10, 1994 with a special two-hour show featuring over 50 of the 300 authors previously featured on the program. For the tenth anniversary of \"Booknotes\" in 1999, Brian Lamb compiled and edited an anthology of stories on 78 people who influenced American history from the 18th century to 1999. Titled \"Booknotes: Life Stories\", each contributed story was written by a well-known biographer.\n\nAfter 801 interviews, the final broadcast aired December 5, 2004. Lamb's guest was Mark Edmundson, author of \"Why Read?\", professor of English at the University of Virginia and a contributing editor at \"Harper's Magazine\". The show was intended to end with the 800th episode, but due to a miscalculation, the final program was actually the 801st.\n\n\"Booknotes\" segments continue to be re-aired on C-SPAN's companion network C-SPAN 2, during Saturday \"Book TV\" broadcasts, while C-SPAN 3 airs repeat segments every weeknight at 11 p.m. Pacific Time. All 801 transcripts are available online and the 801 shows can be viewed online via the \"Booknotes\" website. Lamb's own copies of the \"Booknotes\" books, most of which contain his personal marginalia, are housed in the rare books collection of George Mason University.\n\nThe \"Booknotes\" concept grew out of a one-off interview special with Neil Sheehan, author of \"A Bright Shining Lie\", in September 1988. The interview itself resulted from Lamb having viewed a short commercial television interview with Sheehan and wanting to hear more. According to Lamb, a strong viewer response to the program led to the decision to start producing a weekly author interview program.\n\nEach \"Booknotes\" episode devoted one full hour to an interview with the author of a recently released non-fiction book. In order to avoid duplicate appearances by any one author, each guest appeared only once on the program, thus allowing for over 800 different authors to be interviewed every week over a fifteen-year stretch. The hour-long interviews explored authors' work habits, thoughts and lives, while also covering the intentions of their book and how, or if, these were achieved.\n\nResearch for the interviews was simple: producers identified subjects, arranged for them to appear and Brian Lamb would then read the book in the week prior to the interview. One reason for discontinuing the series, according to Lamb, was the time constraints imposed by reading an entire book every seven days.\n\nThe set where \"Booknotes\" was recorded was similarly basic, comprising a black backdrop, two armchairs and a coffee table.\n\nIn February 2003, Lamb was awarded the National Humanities Medal. In November 2007, Lamb received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his work on C-SPAN. The American Historical Association awarded Lamb the 2004 Theodore Roosevelt-Woodrow Wilson Award \"for extraordinary contributions to the study, teaching, and public understanding of history.\"\n\nNotable guests appearing on \"Booknotes\" to discuss their published writings have included Hillary Clinton, Pat Buchanan, Colin Powell, Frank McCourt and David Crosby. A number of former presidents have appeared on the program, including Richard Nixon on February 23, 1992, Jimmy Carter on February 19, 1995 and Bill Clinton on December 15, 1996. In addition to the U.S. presidents who were interviewed for \"Booknotes\", former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher also appeared on the program.\n\nWhile the majority of \"Booknotes\" subjects have been authors of books on history, politics or public policy, exceptions included the violinist Isaac Stern, who discussed his memoir, \"My First 79 Years\", on the program on January 23, 2000.\n\nIncluding \"Booknotes: Life Stories\", four books have been drawn from the series, with content either comprising original material or taken directly from transcripts of \"Booknotes\" interviews. \"Booknotes: America's Finest Authors on Reading, Writing and the Power of Ideas\" is a compilation of short monologues taken from the transcripts of Brian Lamb’s best interviews. The other two books are \"Booknotes: On American Character\" and \"Booknotes: Stories from American History\".\n\nBrian Lamb has written a series of books for \"Booknotes\":\n\n"}

Some believe that the late 1950s and 1960s were the golden age of Persian music. After the resignation of Mr. Pirnia, Rahi agreed to run the Golha Program and continued to do so up until his illness. He never married. One of his last works was Golhayeh Rangarang #470 that was sung by Haydeh with music by Master Tajvidi (Some claim that this is the song that made Haydeh famous).\n\nHis book \"Sayeh Omr\" (سايه عمر in Persian) (translated \"The Shadow of Life\") of poems was printed in 1964.\n\nHe died on November 15, 1968 in Tehran. He is buried in the \"Zahir o-dowleh\" cemetery in the northern parts of Tehran.\n\nدیدی که رسوا شد دلم، غرق تمنا شد دلم\n\nدیدی که من با این دل بی آرزو عاشق شدم\n\nبا آن همه آزادگی، بر زلف او عاشق شدم\n\nای وای اگر صیاد من، غافل شود از یاد من، قدرم نداند\n\nفریاد اگر از کوی خود، وز رشته‌ی گیسوی خود، بازم رهاند\n\nدر پیش بی دردان چرا، فریاد بی‌حاصل کنم\n\nگر شکوه‌ای دارم ز دل، با یار صاحبدل کنم\n\nوای ز دردی که درمان ندارد\n\nفتادم به راهی که پایان ندارد\n\nشنیدم بوی او، مستانه رفتم سوی او\n\nتا چون غبار کوی او، در کوی جان منزل کند\n\nوای ز دردی که درمان ندارد\n\nفتادم به راهی که پایان ندارد\n\nدیدی که رسوا شد دلم، غرق تمنا شد دلم\n\nدیدی که در گرداب غم، از فتنه‌ی گردون رهی\n\nافتادم و سرگشته چون، امواج دریا شد دلم\n\nدیدی که رسوا شد دلم، غرق تمنا شد دلم\n\n\n"}

It was said that during this year a group of nomadic Manobo from the frontiers of Agusan found an ideal place for their tempora-fishing retreat and rendezvous.\n\nSoon, the village of \"Tortosa\" was founded by two Christian pioneers, Innocentes Paler and Marcelo Dalaguida, who were later on joined by Luis Gupana and a handful of Manobo. Credited with a name to the village were a group of natives and Spaniards who visited the place to trade with the villagers and found the place to be abundant with the sea tortoise.\n\nThe fame of Tortosa as a good fishing was heard by the people of the neighboring Butuan. Thus a fresh wave migrants came to settle.\n\nLater, Tortosa was renamed to \"Kihaw-an\" in memory of a white deer held sacred by the early inhabitants. It was said that this deer was found dead by the natives near the bank of the river which encircles the village. Its carcass was placed all over the village thus the village got the name Kihaw-an, a derivative of a local dialect \"Baho-an\", which literally mean \"to smell\", or \"source of bad smell\".\n\nSoon the village got another new name. It was said that Adolfo Calo, a native of Butuan, together with some natives and Spaniards visited the place. They expanded their visits not only the coastal areas where flourishing because of the abundance of fish.\nAt the top of the hill they saw the village overlooking the sea. They appreciated the beauty of nature in abundance. They exclaimed \"Bien Vista\", which means \"Good View\" thus the present name \"Buenavista\".\n\nEnticed by the abundance of fish and the good prospect for agriculture, a new wave migrants from the neighboring areas continued to flock to Buenavista. Between the years 1897-1907, settlers and their families were known to have settled in the place.\n\nThe only means of transportation was by \"banca\" or fishing boats, and by horseback trudging the small mountain trails. It was only sometime in the 1920s when Buenavista was connected to Butuan by means of road. It was also given power by the Marcon Electric Company of the Marcon family but later on, operation was taken over by the government-owned electric distribution facility.\n\nEfforts of the pioneers paid off, because sometime in early 1920s, Buenavista was declared a regular barrio of the then Municipality of Butuan. As a barrio, Buenavista was able to form its own law-making body which was locally called \"Ang Tingug Sa Lungsod\", whose members were known as \"podientes\".\n\n\"Municipality of Buenavista\" through the efforts of Assemblyman Apolonio D. Curato and Governor Jose R. Rosales, Commissioner of Mindanao and Sulu Teofisto Guingona Sr., and Secretary of Interior, Elpidio Quirino, with a set of appointed officials to serve for a period of one year.\n\nIn the , Buenavista had a population of .

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nFounded in 1894, the city rose from its Spanish period beginnings to become the premier town of Agusan del Norte. Its rich cultural heritage is evident in its preserved colonial period houses and its archaeological collections.\n\nOn August 16, 2000, the seat of provincial government was transferred from Butuan to Cabadbaran through \"Republic Act 8811\", although the provincial government still holds office in Butuan City, pending the actual transfer of provincial offices to the new capital. Cabadbaran was officially declared a city in 2007.\n\nCabadbaran lies 9 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees and 30 minutes east longitude in the northeastern part of Mindanao. Its boundaries are Tubay and Santiago to the north, Butuan Bay to the west, Magallanes and R. T. Romualdez to the south, and Sibagat, Agusan del Sur to the east. It is from Butuan. It is generally flat with rolling hills and swamplands in its western part. The highest of all mountains in the Caraga region, Mount Hilong-Hilong (with an altitude of above sea level), rises in this city.\n\nCabadbaran is politically subdivided into 31 barangays.\n\nThe city belongs to the Second Climatic Type of the Corona Classification. No definite dry season in the place and maximum rainfall occurs from October to January. The average rainfall is per month, average annual temperature .\n\nTraces of 12th century villages can be found near the waterways that pass through the territory of Cabadbaran. No records are found before the Spanish colonization except for a site in Sanghan where Chinese ceramics from 15th to 16th century were found.\n\nCabadbaran was first mentioned by the Spanish as a small village chosen by the Spanish authorities to be turned into a reduction called \"La Reunion de Cabarbaran\" in 1867. The reduction was mostly populated by people from Southern Agusan. Then in 1879, the reduction was disbanded. The inhabitants of the reduction went back to their places of origin while the remaining migrated to Tubay.\n\nIn 1880-1881, the reduction was revived by Father Saturnino Urios, but was named Tolosa to honor Father Urios' hometown in Spain. In 1880, Tolosa was headed by the Teniente del Barrio Don Eduardo Curato. He petitioned to the Spanish authorities for the township application of Tolosa to be approved. In January 31, 1894, the petition was approved. The population and the economy grew, which was driven by agriculture and commerce. But the growth suddenly came to a halt when the revolution against Spain started. No significant turmoil affected the city until the coming of the American forces in 1901.\n\nWhen the Americans arrived, Spanish forces were forced to surrender. Included with them was Capt. Andres Atega. Under the Americans, the town was called again as Cabadbaran (according to Don Andres Atega's proposal).\n\nIn 1903, the public education system was established with George Bohner as the first American teacher. Public health also improved when Dr. Pedro Malbas was appointed as the Public Health Officer in the 1920s and constructed sanitary toilets, deep wells and drainage canals. Public infrastructure was also improved by the Americans.\n\nThen in the 1935 Constitutional Convention, Apolonio \"Oyok\" Curato, a lawyer, represented Agusan. He then became the Governor and Congressman of the province of Agusan.\n\nThe local economy grew when it started producing abaca from coconut plantations established by the Americans. Rice was also grown and remained as staple crop grown in the fields up to this day. The Agusan-Surigao road opened in the 1930s and several bus lines started public service along this route.\n\nCabadbaran had been occupied at one time by those resisting the Japanese occupation of Mindanao. Eventually the Japanese occupied it. On January 17, 1945, combined American and Filipino troops including recognized guerrillas fought a force of Japanese troops on the road between Cabadbaran and Butuan. The Japanese were in the process of reinforcing their garrison at Butuan. The guerrillas retreated when Japanese reinforcements arrived. The guerrillas also had depleted their ammunition.\n\nOn March 31, 1945, Major Juan Rivera and a guerrilla detachment attacked the Japanese at Cabadbaran; the Japanese abandoned the post after an hour-long battle.\n\nThe general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary was active on 1945 to 1946 in Cabadbaran during and aftermath of World War II.\n\nThe entirety of Cabadbaran speaks Cebuano. There are also significant number of people who speak Surigaonon, for these people have lived or have ancestries from the northern municipalities and speak in a variety of the Jabonganon, Mainitnon and Gigaquitnon dialects of the Surigaonon language. Hiligaynon, Waray, Manobo languages, Butuanon, Boholano dialect, and Maranao have also less significant speakers in the area while English and Filipino are also widely used spoken.\n\nCabadbaran produces several agricultural crops such as rice, corn, coconut, abaca, banana, and mango. The city has the biggest area planted with coconuts in Agusan del Norte with 18.46% of the total land area planted with the crop.\n\nThe Cabadbaran also has a booming economy based on agro industry, commerce and trade, source of several export and industrial products; it has also varied ecotourism destinations ranging from Caraga's highest peak, mile long tunnels to adventure tourism sites.\n\nLike the popular destinations situated on neighboring provinces, Cabadbaran experiences a growing ecotourism industry. Annual climbs to reach CARAGA's highest peak Mt. Hilong-Hilong (2,012 meters above sea level) has been organized by trekkers and mountaineers, there are also organized climbs to Mt. Mas-ai, a plateau located in Puting Bato which has a mountain top lake. Locals have also put up white water tubing adventures along Cabadbaran River including rappelling at some of the steep falls located at the foot of Mt. Hilong-hilong. Mt. Pongkay, which is a hill that can be seen from the city proper, can be a great destination for families who wants to experience the value of the Holy Week's penance and devotion. It is also a destination for mountain climbers and for those people who wants to see the panoramic view of Agusan del Norte and Butuan Bay.\n\nCabadbaran also has cheap inland pools by local residents that is an alternative to inland resorts. Many of these pools have sprouted through the years because of Cabadbaran's abundant fresh water which the city is known for. The city is also a beach destination for people from neighboring municipalities because of its crystal clear water and gray sandy beaches. The city has multiple hotels as well like Loreta's, Gazebo, and Casa Alburo.\n\nAlthough Cabadbaran does not yet have any mainstream fast food restaurants, the city has various restaurants that offers Filipino, Japanese, and Chinese cuisine, an alternative to people who wants to have their fine dining locally than in the neighboring Butuan City.\n\n\nAfter the Provincial Government of Agusan del Norte attain the reclassification of their land conducted by the Dept. of Agriculture (DA) in Barangay Sanghan, Cabadbaran City where the new Capitol building will be constructed, the land conversion by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) will soon follow.

There are also vans, jeep and multi-cabs that have routes towards both Surigao City and Butuan City which are stationed in the City Transport Terminal.\n\nCurrently the city has no sea and airports. Cabadbaran can be reached by air from Manila and Cebu via Butuan City which is 30 kilometers away. From the Visayas, it can be accessed via the Nasipit Municipal Port in Nasipit, Agusan del Norte (60 km) or via the Lipata Port and Verano International Port both in Surigao City (79 km) through the Maharlika Highway\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2049408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049408", "title": "Isa Khan", "text": "Isa Khan\n\nIsa Khan (c. 1529 – September 1599) was a Muslim Rajput chieftain who led the Baro Bhuiyans (twelve landlords) and a Zamindar of the Bhati region in 16th-century Bengal. Throughout his reign he resisted the Mughal empire invasion. It was only after his death that the region fell totally under Mughal control.\n\nBhagirath, grandfather of Isa Khan, belonged to the Kshatriya Rajput community of the Bais clan. He came to Bengal from Ayodhya and took the job of Dewan under the Sultan of Bengal Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah (reigned 1533–1538). His son Kalidas Gazdani inherited the post after his death. Later, Kalidas converted to Islam and took the Muslim name \"Sulaiman Khan\". Sulaiman married the Sultan's daughter Syeda Momena Khatun and received the Zamindari of Sarail (present-day Sarail Upazila, Brahmanbaria, Bangladesh) in the Bhati region. Their son, Isa Khan, was born in Sarail.\n\nFollowing the death of Sultan Ghiyasuddin, Sulaiman declared himself as the legal successor and revolted against the newly established Afghan rule. He was later killed in battle.\n\nAccording to Abul Fazl, a 16th-century historian and the author of \"Akbarnama\":\n\nWith the help of Taj Khan, a Karrani ruler during 1564–1566, Isa obtained an estate in Sonargaon and Maheswardi Pargana in 1564 as a vassal of Karrani dynasty of Bengal. He gradually increased his power. In 1573 he helped Daud Khan Karrani in his expedition to Chittagong against Udai Manikya, the king of Tripura. He also helped in driving out the Mughal's Navy from the vicinity of Sonargaon in 1575. Isa's services to Daud Khan earned him the title of \"Masnad-i-Ala\" of Khizirpur.\n\nThe ruling of Karrani dynasty ended when Daud Khan was defeated in the Battle of Rajmahal in 1576. Isa started playing a leading role in the local resistance. In the end he successfully conquered Dhaka, Rangpur, Pabna, Tripura, parts of Mymensingh and Bogra. In 1577, Isa established Egarasindhur (in present-day Pakundia Upazila, Kishoreganj) as the political and trading centre. Forming a petty kingdom that remained independent. He declared himself as the ruler of the Bhati region in 1581–82. From Sarail, he shifted his administrative centre to Sonargaon. He built fortresses at Katrabo, Kalagachhia and Khizrpur near Sonargaon.\n\nIn 1578, Mughal Subahdar of Bengal, Subahdar Khan Jahan led an expedition towards the Bhati region and set camp in Bhawal. Isa faced the Mughal force led by Shah Bardi and Muhammad Quli on the Sarail-Juan Shahi border in Kastul on the bank of Meghna river. According to the \"Rajmala\", Isa then quickly retreated to Tripura and sought assistance from the Tripura king, Amar Manikya. With the good grace of the queen Amrabati, the king granted an army of 52,000 to help Isa face the Mughals.\n\nHowever, before Isa returned to Sarail, two zamindars – Majlis Pratap and Majlis Dilawar already attacked and defeated the Mughal forces under Khan Jahan. Muhammad Quli was captured but Shah Bardi fled to Bhawal camp. Khan Jahan retreated to the city of Tandah where he died on 19 December 1578 after a prolonged illness.\n\nAccording to descriptions by Rajmala, Khan, who became the Zamindar of Sarail, sent one thousand labourers for Amar Manikya along with other Zamindars of Bengal in response to the request made by Manikya to excavate the \"Amar Sagar Dighi\" at around 1580 AD. Besides, as the naval commander of Manikya, Khan fought against the Zamindars of Taraf and Sylhet, Syed Musa and Fateh Khan respectively, in 1581.\n\nIn 1583, Mughal General Shahbaz Khan destroyed Isa's palace in Baktiarpur. In September 1584, the then-subahdar Shahbaz crossed Ganges near Khizirpur and attacked Sonargaon, Katrabo and Egarasindhur and pursued the defeated Pathan forces under Masum Kabuli up to Bikrampur in Dhaka, the cunning Isa then deluded negotiation of surrender and delayed the attack of Mughal general for several months. However, in 1584, Isa and Masum Khan Kabuli, deploying musket and gunpowder artilleries, launched a counterattack which finally defeated Shahbaz Khan in the naval and land battles of Egarasindur and Bhawal, and even killing one of Mughal general, then Shahbaz Khan retreated to Tandah.\n\nIn 1585, he attacked two Koch rulers, Ram Hazra and Lakshman Hazra, and occupied their Jangalbari Fort (in present-day Karimganj Upazila, Kishoreganj).\n\nAnother source from local tradition was recorded that this happened in 1586 after Man Singh had defeated him in the battle of Egarasindhur. In the same year, Mughal Subahdar Shahbaz Khan again sent his forces against Isa to the south.\n\nWith the help of reinforcements by Emperor Akbar, Shahbaz Khan led another military expedition towards Bhati in 1586. Isa attacked him at Bhawal (north of Dhaka) but forces of Shahbaz Khan were well fortified near Brahmaputra. Isa then chose to give allegiance towards Akbar and prevented an imminent invasion of Bengal by the Mughals.\n\nHe even promised the Mughals he would dispatch Ma'sum Khan Kabuli, the renegade to a compulsory Pilgrimage to Mecca, something that viewed as an act of banishment.\n\nIn late 1586, Ralph Fitch, an English traveler and merchant, came to Sonargaon, Bengal's eastern districts and stated,\nLater on in 1588, he was involved in conflicts against Chand Rai and Kedar Rai.\n\nIsa continued his campaign against the Koch dynasty. He fought and defeated Raghudev, the king of Koch Hajo, who ruled from Sankosh river in the west to the Bhareli river in the east on the north bank of the Brahmaputra river and rival to Koch Bihar kingdom which gained prominence after the latter's annexation by Mughal empire. Isa successfully captured portions of Raghudev's territory as far as Rangamati and Goalpara. However, later Isa Khan and Raghudev formed an alliance against the threat of Mughal invasion.\n\nOn 17 March 1594, Man Singh was appointed the Subahdar of Bengal by Emperor Akbar. After establishing Rajmahal as the capital of Bengal, Man Singh sent his own son, Durjan Singh, to Isa's Bhati region with a vast army on 7 December 1595. Isa was emboldened to resist the Mughals after he successfully sought alliance with Raghudev, his former enemy and Kedar Rai, Zamindar of Bhusna in Faridpur. In the clash that took place in August 1597, Isa became engaged in a battle against Mughal naval forces with the assistance of Masum Khan Kabuli, an ex-Mughal defector. At first Isa faced defeat with the Mughals attacking Katrabo, one of Isa's pargana and city. However, on 5 September, Durjan Singh was killed and the Mughal forces were defeated. Both the army and navy of the Mughal-Koch Bihar alliance were either routed or captured.\n\nIt is recorded that in this clash, Isa personally fought Man Singh in a duel. However, the duel ended inconclusively when Isa Khan stopped fighting after Man Singh's sword broke. The noble gesture touched Man Singh and both men developed respect for each other which culminated into a friendship. Man Singh's respect for his rival was later made evident; when Isa sought to submit to the Mughal under a guarantee that it was wiser for Mughals not to incite a full invasion, Man Singh accompanied him to the Mughal court.\n\nDue to his submission, Akbar assigned 22 parganas or administrative units under the ruling of Isa.\nKhan first married Fatima Khan, a daughter of Syed Ibrahim Danishmand and a descendant of the Hussain Shahi dynasty. Later he married Sarna Moi, the daughter of Chand Rai of Sripur. After her conversion to Islam, Sarna Moi took the name \"Sona Bibi\".\n\nKhan's son, Musa Khan, took control of Sonargaon after his death. On 10 July 1610 Musa was dethroned by Mughal General Islam Khan Chisti. After that, the descendants of Isa left Sonargaon and settled in Jangalbari Fort. Masum Khan was the eldest son of Musa Khan. Masum served as the Mughal army General during the Hughly invasion in 1632.\nHis eldest son was Monwar Khan. Monwar acted as the chief of the Bengal Zamindars' flotilla on the conquest of Chittagong in 1666. A village called \"Monwarbagh\", in Bandar Upazila of Narayanganj District, was named after him. Haybat Khan, another grandson of Musa, established \"Haybatnagar\" (in present-day Kishoreganj district) and made it the centre of his land-lordship of seven parganas.\n\nJames Wise (d. 1886), a civil surgeon in Dhaka for 10 years, published a report on Baro-Bhuyans in \"Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Volume 43\" in 1874. He found information from the account of his meeting with the descendants of Isa in Jangalbari and Haybatnagar. He addressed Isa as the \"Zamindar of Khizirpur\". The Haybatnagar family had possessed sent by Shah Shuja in 1649 and another one from Shaista Khan in 1667. Subhan Dad Khan had been the head of the family in Jangalbari in 1874. The other descendant of Haybatnagar family, Ilah Nawaz Khan, had died in Calcutta in 1872. Other branches of the family had settled in Jafarabad, Baghalpur, Mymensingh, Harishpur (Tripura), Katrabo (Dhaka), and Barisal. The wealth, property and Zamindari was distributed amongst the descendants which is why they each lived in different parts of the country.\n\nDescendants such as Dewan Amin Dau Khan, Hazi Abdul Gani Khan and many more, have families who resides within Bangladesh even today.\n\nAs of 2005, Dewan Amin Dau Khan, the 14th descendant of Isa has been living in Jangalbari Fort in Egarasindur village. The fort seemed to have a circular front and had 40 rooms. The fort was mostly destroyed during an earthquake in 1893.\n\nKhan died of natural causes in September 1599. His tomb remains in the village of Baktarpur in Kaliganj Upazila, Gazipur District of Bangladesh.\n\nOn 12 February 1909, a farmer unearthed seven cannons in Monwarbagh in Bandar, Narayanganj. The cannons were partly made of brass. They had labels \"Isa Khan\" and \"1002\" (Hijri 1002 year is 1593 CE in Gregorian Calendar). These cannons were made from the era of Sher Shah Suri who ruled Bengal before the Bara Bhuiyans while at least three cannons which carved with Isa Khan labels were made during the Baro-Bhuyans independent era.\n\nBangladesh Navy has named a base, BNS Issa Khan in his honour. The base, BNS Issa Khan, was the first Bangladesh Navy base to receive the national standard in 1974.\n\nOn 15 September 1992, Bangladesh issued a commemorative stamp in honour of Isa.\n\nA jatra, named \"Isa Khan\", depicting the life of Isa, written by Bhoironnath Gangopadhyay and directed by Mridul Kanti Dey, was staged on the premises of \"Bangladesh Lok O Karu Shilpa Foundation\" on 18 October 2012.\n\n\n\n"}

He then served for five years (1998–2003) as the network's chief Middle East correspondent.\n\nMacdonald was involved in a public dispute with Canadian media mogul Leonard Asper in 2003. Asper had accused Macdonald of being \"anti-Israeli\" after taking exception to some of the CBC's Middle East coverage. Macdonald responded with a rebuttal in \"The Globe and Mail\", accusing Asper of defamation and alleging editorial censorship in the Asper-owned CanWest media outlets.\n\nIn November 2010, Macdonald led a CBC investigation into the United Nations International Independent Investigation Commission and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which had been mandated with solving the murder of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. The report uncovered documents suggesting the UN investigative body had strong evidence to link the Shia paramilitary group Hezbollah to the 2005 bombing that killed Hariri, and that the UN had not acted on this intelligence due to diplomatic concerns. Macdonald's report also sharply criticized the performance of the Special Tribunal's head prosecutor, Daniel Bellemare, who responded that he was \"extremely disappointed\" with the report.\n\nIn 2014, Macdonald harshly criticized Linden MacIntyre, a former CBC employee, after MacIntyre made comments about the CBC in regard to the Jian Ghomeshi incident.\n\nIn 2015, Macdonald moved back to Canada after 17 years in the United States, 12 of which he spent in Washington, D.C. as the Washington bureau correspondent for \"The National\".

The album was also independently rereleased in 2001 with digital remastering, bonus tracks and new cover art (with \"Dissonance\" misspelled as \"Dissonence\" on the tray liner edges). Readers of HM Magazine voted \"Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance\" as \"Favourite Album of the 1990s\". Intense Records released the album to the Christian market and Metal Blade Records released it to the secular market. In 2010, \"HM Magazine\" ranked it #23 on the Top 100 Christian metal albums of all-time list.\n\n\"Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance\" was recorded at different studios, one being Mixing Lab A & B. The album was produced by Bill Metoyer.\n\nMusically, the album went for a more aggressive thrash metal direction. The songs are complicated and technical and feature experiments with styles such jazz and blues. The latter can be heard on the song \"Phantom Limb\". The band's characteristical style of incorporating classical music into its guitar riffs is especially reminiscent on the beginning of the title track. The album introduced more Slayer-esque shouting vocal patterns by Gary Lenaire as well as a darker atmosphere. Guy Ritter sang less on the album than on previous Tourniquet albums. It is often thought that the vocalist Guy Ritter left the band during the recording session. However, in a HM Magazine interview he clarified:\n\nRitter stated his reasons for leaving the band:\n\nAccording to Ritter, there was also some disagreements concerning the label:\n\nThe lyrics kept the pattern that began on Psycho Surgery and feature bizarre medical terminology. These terms and syndromes are used as metaphors for spiritual and social issues. The album title refers to color blindness and the title song uses it as a metaphor for lack of wisdom of sight from God. \"Gelatinous Tubercles of Purulent Ossification\" is about nicotine addiction that causes larynx benediction. The sound samples of the song are produced with Western Electric 5000 voice synthesizer.\n\nThe 10-minute song \"The Skeezix Dilemma\" uses the board Uncle Wiggily's (also a children's book series by Howard Roger Garis) concept as an allegory for child abuse. The song starts out with a minute of circus music (organ played by Bob Beeman) which is followed by a nervous child reading a bit of the game's introduction. The heavy metal song \"Exoskeletons\" contains a short riff of Black Sabbath's song \"Supernaut\" at the end.

{"id": "2049464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049464", "title": "Culture of Armenia", "text": "Culture of Armenia\n\nThe culture of Armenia encompasses many elements that are based on the geography, literature, architecture, dance, and music of the people.\n\nLiterature began in Armenia around 401 A.D. The majority of the literary arts were created by Moses of Khorene, in the 5th century. Through the years the elements of literature have changed as the stories and myths were passed on through generations. In the late 17th century, Alexander Tertzakian was a renowned Armenian writer who created several works considered to be among Armenia's classics. During the 19th century, writer Mikael Nalbandian worked to create a new Armenian literary identity. Nalbandian's poem \"Song of the Italian Girl\" may have been the inspiration for the Armenian national anthem, Mer Hayrenik.\n\nMesrop Mashtots is considered to be the creator of the Armenian alphabet. This event which took place in the 5th century is considered to be one of the most important turning points of Armenian Literature\n\nMovses Khorenatsi was a prominent Armenian historian from the period of late antiquity and the author of the \"History of the Armenians\".\n\nKhorenatsi is credited with the earliest known historiographical work on the history of Armenia written in Armenian, but was also a poet, or hymn writer, and a grammarian. The \"History of Armenia\" was written at the behest of Prince Sahak Bagratuni and has had an enormous impact on Armenian historiography. It was used and quoted extensively by later medieval Armenian authors. Although other Armenians, such as Agathangelos, had previously written histories on Armenia, Movses' work holds particular significance because it contains unique material on the old oral traditions in Armenia before its conversion to Christianity and, more importantly, traces Armenian history from Movses' day back to its origins.\n\nThe Armenian dance heritage has been one of the oldest, richest and most varied in the Near East. From the fifth to the third millennia B.C., in the higher regions of Armenia there are rock paintings of scenes of country dancing. These dances were probably accompanied by certain kinds of songs or musical instruments. In the 5th century Moses of Khorene (Movsés Khorenats'i) himself had heard of how the old descendants of Aram (that is Armenians) make mention of these things (epic tales) in the ballads for the lyre and their songs and dances.\n\nOne of the most energetic Armenian dances is the martial dance Yarkhushta. Yarkhushta is believed to have its origins in the early Middle Ages as it is mentioned in the works of Movses Khorenatsi, Faustus of Byzantium, and Grigor Magistros. Yarkhushta has traditionally been danced by Armenian soldiers before combat engagements, partly for ritualistic purposes, and partly in order to cast off fear and boost battle spirit.\n\nThe dance is performed by men, who face each other in pairs. The key element of the dance is a forward movement when participants rapidly approach one another and vigorously clap onto the palms of hands of dancers in the opposite row.\n\nClassical Armenian architecture is divided into four separate periods. The first Armenian churches were built between the 4th and 7th Century, beginning when Armenia converted to Christianity, and ending with the Arab invasion of Armenia. The early churches were mostly simple basilicas, but some with side apses. By the 5th century the typical cupola cone in the center had become widely used. By the 7th century, centrally-planned churches had been built and a more complicated \"niched buttress\" and radiating \"Hrip'simé\" style had formed. By the time of the Arab invasion, most of what we now know as classical Armenian architecture had formed.\n\nThough women historically dominated carpet-weaving in Armenian communities, several prominent carpet-weavers in Karabakh are known to have been men, and in some cases whole families took up the art. The oldest extant Armenian carpet from the region, referred to as Artsakh during the medieval era, is from the village of Banants (near Gandzak) and dates to the early 13th century. The first time that the Armenian word for carpet, \"gorg\", was used in historical sources was in a 1242-1243 Armenian inscription on the wall of the Kaptavan Church in Artsakh.\n\nArt historian Hravard Hakobyan notes that \"Artsakh carpets occupy a special place in the history of Armenian carpet-making. Common themes and patterns found on Armenian carpets were the depiction of dragons and eagles. They were diverse in style, rich in color and ornamental motifs, and were even separated in categories depending on what sort of animals were depicted on them, such as \"artsvagorgs\" (eagle-carpets), \"vishapagorgs\" (dragon-carpets) and \"otsagorgs\" (serpent-carpets). The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches, \"covered with vegatative ornaments\", and bears an artistic resemblance to the illuminated manuscripts produced in Artsakh.\n\nThe art of carpet weaving was in addition intimately connected to the making of curtains as evidenced in a passage by Kirakos Gandzaketsi, a 13th-century Armenian historian from Artsakh, who praised Arzu-Khatun, the wife of regional prince Vakhtang Khachenatsi, and her daughters for their expertise and skill in weaving.\n\nArmenian carpet was also renowned by foreigners who traveled to Artsakh; the Arab geographer and historian Al-Masudi noted that, among other works of art, he had never seen such carpets elsewhere in his life.\n\nThe National Art Gallery in Yerevan has more than 16,000 works that date back to the Middle Ages, which indicate Armenia's rich tales and stories of the times. It houses paintings by many European masters as well. The Modern Art Museum, the Children's Picture Gallery, and the Martiros Saryan Museum are only a few of the other noteworthy collections of fine art on display in Yerevan. Moreover, many private galleries are in operation, with many more opening every year, featuring rotating exhibitions and sales.\n\nLike Lacis, Armenian needlelace seems to be an obvious descendant of netmaking. Where lacis adds decorative stitches to a net ground, Armenian needlelace involves making the net itself decorative. There is some archaeological evidence suggesting the use of lace in prehistoric Armenia and the prevalence of pre-Christian symbology in traditional designs would certainly suggest a pre-Christian root for this art form.\nIn contrast to Europe where lace was the preserve of the nobility, in Armenia it decorated everything from traditional headscarves to lingerie. Thus lacemaking was part of many women's lives.\n\nBorn in Cairo, Egypt, Atom Egoyan is now an internationally known filmmaker who is celebrated for his contemporary work, including personal feature films and other related projects. He is the winner of many awards at international film festivals, such as the Grand Prix and international Critics’ Awards from the Cannes Film Festival and two Academy Award nominations for “The Sweet Hereafter”. Egoyan has also worked in the television and theatre industries, producing Wagner's Die Walkure which was performed by the Canadian Opera Company in April 2004. Egoyan's creation Ararat (2002) is about the 1915 Armenian Genocide perpetrated by Turks in the Turkish Ottoman Empire. It depicts the consequences and suffering of a child survivor Arshile Gorky, and is an incredibly made-movie for both Armenians and non-Armenians.\n\nOne of the most important parts of Armenian culture is the music, which has brought new forms of music in recent years, while maintaining traditional styles too. This is evidenced by the world-class Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra that performs at the beautifully refurbished Aram Khachaturian Concert Hall in the Yerevan Opera House, where one can also attend a full season of opera. In addition, several chamber ensembles are highly regarded for their musicianship, including the Komitas Quartet, Hover Chamber Choir, National Chamber Orchestra of Armenia and the Serenade Orchestra. Classical music can also be heard at one of several smaller venues, including the Yerevan State Musical Conservatory, the Komitas Chamber Music Hall and the Komitas Museum. Jazz is popular in Armenia, especially in the summer when live performances are a regular occurrence at one of the city's many outdoor cafés and parks. Armenian rock has made its input to the rock culture. The most known Armenian traditional instrument is the duduk ( or \"doo-dook\").\n\nModern day Armenian artists have incorporated folk music into more modern jazz and rock genres so that the traditional music still influences their creations.\n\nInga and Anush Arshakyans are an unexpected duo who create ethno, contemporary tracks that are also full of Armenian spirit. After graduating from the Yerevan State Conservatory, the singers started performing together on the professional stage in 2000. Later, in 2009 Inga & Anush represented Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest in Moscow. They ended up taking the tenth place with 92 points. Their music is a balanced fusion of Armenian folk music, rock, jazz and other contemporary genres. Some of their most popular tracks include Menq Enq Mer Sarere and Im Anune Hayastan e.\n\nAnother singer from Yerevan, Armenia who is popular among young adults is Armen Gondrachyan, more famously known as ‘Armenchik’. The influence of his father, who was also a singer, inspired Armen to start singing at the young age of seven. In 1989, Armen and his family moved to the United States, while in 1995, at the age of fifteen, he found a band and recorded his first album. In 1988, Armen went back to his hometown in Armenia and lived there for a year, and at the same time released the album, “Armen, memories from Armenia.” This release initiated his path to star-dom. With his current fame, Armen is still very dedicated to the Armenian community. It was in October 2003 that he had his first concert in Glendale, California. The concert was a sellout, and in that same year, Armen received an award for the best-selling album of the year, “Anunt Inche”.\n\nIsabel Bayrakdarian is an opera singer of Armenian descent and is now known and popular both among Armenians and non-Armenians. She graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in biomedical engineering, but has become very successful in North America as an opera singer and an active concertizer. She is featured on the Grammy-award-winning soundtrack of the infamous film, the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Bayrakdarian is also the winner of four Juno Awards for Best Classical Album (Vocal). Further, she is a featured vocalist of Atom Egoyan's movie, Ararat, in collaboration with the band “Delerium”, which brought in another Grammy nomination.\n\nŞahan Arzruni is an internationally renowned concert pianist, born in Istanbul, Turkey. Through his live performances and sound recordings he has disseminated the Armenian piano music throughout the world. He has some two dozen recordings, devoted mostly to the works of Armenian composer. Arzruni is also an author, a lecturer, a producer and impresario. He has been awarded two medals by the Armenian government for furthering Armenian culture. He lives in New York City.\n\nSince 2014, The Naghash Ensemble has been touring in Europe performing new music by American-Armenian composer John Hodian based on sacred Armenian poetry by the medieval painter, poet and priest Mkrtich Naghash. With three female vocalists, duduk, oud, dhol and piano, The Naghash Ensemble combines new classical music and post-minimaslism with Armenian folk and spiritual music.\n\n\"Soviet Armenia\" (1924) was the first Armenian documentary film. \"Namus\" was the first Armenian silent black and white film (1926, ), directed by Hamo Beknazarian and based on a play of Alexander Shirvanzade describing the ill fate of two lovers, who were engaged by their families to each other since childhood, but because of violations of \"namus\" (a tradition of honor), the girl was married by her father. In 1969, Sergei Parajanov created \"The Color of Pomegranates\".\n\nThe Armenian language dates to the early period of Indo-European differentiation and dispersion some 5000 years ago, or perhaps as early as 7,800 years ago according to some recent research. Trade and conquest forced the language to change, adding new words into the people's vocabulary. Literature and books written in Armenian appeared by the 4th century. The written language of that time, called classical Armenian or Grabar Craper, remained the Armenian literary language, with various changes, until the 19th century. Meanwhile, spoken Armenian developed independently of the written language. Many dialects appeared when Armenian communities became separated by geography or politics, and not all of these dialects are mutually intelligible. English is a popular language in the business world.\n\nArmenian cuisine is as ancient as the history of Armenia, a combination of different tastes and aromas. The food often has quite a distinct smell. Closely related to eastern and Mediterranean cuisine, various spices, vegetables, fish, and fruits combine to present unique dishes. Armenia is also famous for its wine and brandy. In particular, Armenian cognac is renowned worldwide (winner of several awards), and was considered by the late British Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill, as his favourite. It has often been referred to as the food of today.\n\nA very important aspect of the Armenian cuisine is the traditional bread called Lavash. In 2014, \"Lavash, the preparation, meaning and appearance of traditional bread as an expression of culture in Armenia\" was included in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nThe Armenian soup, Khash, also has its own, unique place in the Armenian cuisine. The name \"khash\" originates from the Armenian verb \"khashél\" (Armenian: խաշել), which means \"to boil.\" The dish, initially called \"khashoy\", is mentioned by a number of medieval Armenian authors, e.g. Grigor Magistros (11th century), Mkhitar Heratsi (12th century), Yesayi Nchetsi (13th century), etc.\n\nThe pomegranate, with its symbolic association with fertility represents that nation. The apricot is the national fruit. Since Roman times, the apricot was known as \"Prunus Armeniaca,\" literally translated as \" Armenian Plum\".\nAccording to encyclopedia.com,\"A popular Armenian drink to this day is tan, a mixture of water and soured yogurt\".\n\nA wide array of sports are played in Armenia. Football is the most popular sport in Armenia. Other popular sports are wrestling, weightlifting, judo, chess, and boxing. Armenia's mountainous terrain provides great opportunities for the practice of sports like skiing and rock climbing. Being a landlocked country, water sports can only be practiced on lakes, notably Lake Sevan. Competitively, Armenia has been very successful at chess, weightlifting, and wrestling at the international level. Armenia is also an active member of the international sports community, with full membership in the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), Federation of International Bandy (FIB), and International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). It also hosts the Pan-Armenian Games.\n\nIn Post-Soviet countries, the Armenian football players are well known for their skills and well developed techniques. This is mainly due to the success of the Armenian players such as, Khoren Hovhannisyan, Eduard Markarov, Levon Ishtoyan, Nikita Simonyan and etc. One of the biggest successes of Armenian club was the took place in the golden year of 1973, where the famous Armenian club Ararat Yerevan took both, the title of the Soviet Top League and the Soviet Cup.\n\nSince independence, Armenia has been very successful in chess. Armenia's men team have won the Chess Olympiad 3 times, making them 5th most successful team in chess world history. Famous chess players, such as Tigran Petrosyan and Garry Kasparov are both of Armenian origins.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2049480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049480", "title": "Banalata Sen", "text": "Banalata Sen\n\nBanalata Sen () is a Bengali poem written in 1942 by the poet Jibanananda Das that is one of the most read, recited and discussed poems of Bengali literature. The title of this lyric poem is a female character referred to by name in the last line of each of its three stanzas. A draft of the poem was also discovered that widely differs from the final version. Poet Jibanananda Das was a quiet person, who preferred to live in obscurity. Until the discovery of his diaries in the mid-1990s, it was considered unlikely that he could have been in love with a woman with or without the name of Banalata Sen. However, Banalata Sen of Natore, a tiny town in the Rajshahi area of what was then Bengal, has become an emblem of feminine mystery as well as beauty and love.\n\n\"Banalata Sen\" was composed by Jibanananda Das in 1934 when he was living in Calcutta, at a time in his life when he had lost his job of Assistant Lecturer at the City College, Kolkata. The relevant manuscript was discovered and labelled Book-8 while preserved in the National Library of Calcutta; the poem occurs on page 24 of this manuscript. It was first published in the December 1935 issue of the poetry magazine \"Kavita\", edited by poet Buddhadeva Bose. It is also the first poem of his third collection of poetry published in 1942 under the title \"Banalata Sen\". Earlier, the lyric was collected in \"Modern Bengali Poetry\", jointly edited by Abu Sayeed Ayub and Hirendranath Mukhopadhyaya, published in 1939. Although popularly regarded a romantic lyric, the poet's historical sense of human existence is unmistakably the underlying essence.\n\nThe poem consists of three stanzas each comprising six lines composed in the Bengali metrical pattern Aksherbritta or Poyar. The title of this lyric poem, Banalata Sen, is a female character referred to by name in the last line of each of its three stanzas. The poem is self-narrated by an unnamed traveller. Banalata Sen is the name of a woman whom the poem describes as being from the town of Natore, a town in Bangladesh.\n\nIn the first stanza the traveller describes seeing her after having wandered upon the earth over thousands of years. The narrator says that it has been a thousand years since he started trekking the earth. He describes it as a long journey in night's darkness from the Ceylonese waters to the Malayan seas. From this geographical expanse he goes on to the extent of time, saying that, in the course of his wanderings he has traversed the fading world of Bimbisara and Ashoka. He adds that he went further, to the forgotten city of Vidharbha. Finally he speaks of himself as now being a weary soul although the ocean of life around continues to foam and adds that in the meanwhile he had a few soothing moments with Natore's Banalata Sen.\n\nIn the second stanza the traveller describes Banalata Sen. First he compares her hair with the dark night of long-lost \"Vidisha\". Then he compares her face with the fine sculpture of Sravasti. Then the traveller-narrator recollects that when he saw her in the shadow it was like a mariner whose ship was wrecked in a faraway sea spotting verdant land among barren islands. In the first encounter Banalata Sen, raising her comforting eyes, inquires of him, “Where had you been lost all these days?”\n\nIn the third stanza the traveller returns from geography and history and recalls Banalata Sen with emotion. He says that when at the day's end evening crawls in like the sound of dews and the kite shakes off the smell of sun from its wings; and, then, when all colours take leave from the world except for the flicker of the hovering fireflies as all birds come home and rivers retire, a time comes when all transactions of the day are done. Then nothing remains but darkness when the traveller would like to sit face-to-face with Banalata Sen and share with her his ballad of stories.\n\nThe poet-narrator proceeds by alluding to different mythological and ancient persons, places and events. He describes having wandered from the Ceylonese ocean to the seas of Malaya, having travelled in Ancient India in the times of Emperor Bimbisara, and centuries later, in the times of Ashoka the Great. He describes having wandered in darkness in the ancient cities of Vidarbha and Vidisha, yet, for his tired soul, the only moment of peace in any age was with Banalata Sen of Natore.\n\nThe lyric Banalata Sen is the most representative of the essence of Jibanananda's poetry and exemplifies his use of imagery. The weary traveller is an interactive motif in his poetry. The poem itself uses four key images comprehensively, namely the darkness, flowing water, passage of time, and a woman. Jibanananda progressively develops these same four images throughout the poem, metamorphosing these from remoteness to intimacy, dimness to distinction and from separation to union.\n\nBanalata is a feminine name in the Bengali language that would have been fashionable in the Bengali middle class \"Bhadralok\" community of Jibanananda's parents' generation. The surname \"Sen\" ordinarily denotes the vaidya caste to which Jibanananda's own family belonged before they became Brahmo. Natore is a small \"mofussil\" town, now in Bangladesh, that developed during the Colonial era at a time that a number of towns developed throughout Bengal, spurred by the colonial economy and social changes. That places her as a contemporary woman, but Jibanananda describes her in terms of forgotten and classical locations, essentially portraying her as 'timeless'. She is as much as a spirit as a woman. Popularly, she is an emblem of beauty. Famous Indian painters who have tried to capture Banalata Sen in their works include Ganesh Paine and Jogen Chaudhuri.\n\nBanalata Sen is a recurrent theme in Jibanananda's work. Jibanananda's poetry, with his characteristic rich tapestry of imagery, repeatedly portrays the image of human fulfillment personified by a woman—in this poem Banalata Sen. For a long time it has been held that no-one like Banalata Sen actually existed in Jibanananda's life. However, Jibanananda first used this name in \"Karubasona\", by and large an autobiographical novel he wrote in 1932 which was never discussed. The novel was first published in 1986 many years after his death in 1954. There Banalata, a young maiden, happens to be the neighbour of the protagonist.\n\nOften Jibanananda's Banalata Sen has been compared with \"To Helen\" by Edgar Allan Poe. In a certain sense, \"Banalata Sen\" is akin to \"To Helen\". However, while Helen's beauty is the central theme in Poe's work, for Jibanananda, Banalata Sen is merely a framework to hold his anxiety for apparently endless human existence on earth since primordial time. She has occurred with various names like \"Shaymoli\", \"Sobita\", \"Suronjana\", etc. However, one can see that while Poe has ended by appreciating the beauty of a woman, Jibanananda has gone far deeper and on the landscape of a woman's beauty has painted the expanse of human existence both in terms of time and topography, drawing attention to the ephemeral existence of human beings. Unlike the poetry of many others, Jibanananda's poetry is the result of filtered interaction between emotions and intellect. In the endless tumultuous continuum of 'time' Banalata Sen is a dot of quietude and tranquillity. Banalata Sen is a feminine emblem that Jibanananda created in his virtual world and faced on many occasions with wonder and questions as embodied in different poems. In sum, although popularly regarded a romantic lyric, the poet's historical sense of human existence is unmistakably the underlying essence.\n\nStarting with poet Jibanananda Das himself, Banalata Sen has been translated into English by many hands. They include Martin Kirkman, one with the initials S.D., Puroshuttam Das together with Shamosri Das, P. Lal, Mary Lago in collaboration with Tarun Gupta, Pritish Nandy, Chidananda Dasgupta, Ananda Lal, Clinton B. Seely, Sukanta Chaudhuri, Anupam Banerjee, Hayat Saif, Fakrul Alam, Anjana Basu, Joe Winter, Ron. D K Banergjee, Joydeep Bhattacharya, Arun Sarker, Amitabha Mukerjee, Santanu Sinha Chaudhuri, Shamik Bose and Tanmoy Sanyal. A comparison of the translations reflect difference in understanding and interpretation as perceived by the translators. In certain points, interpretation by the translator differs from that of the poet himself, as reflected in his own translation.\n\nThere is one instance where all translators, except one, have decidedly diverted from the temporal sense of the text. The first line \"haajaar bochor dhore aami path haatitechi prithibir pothey\" is in present perfect continuous tense. Most translations have rendered this either into simple past tense or present perfect tense. Oblivious of the continuity of the act Martin Kirkman translated : A thousand years I have wandered upon the earth. Amitabha Mukerjee translated : A thousand years I have walked these paths. Sukanta Chaudhuri rendered : I have walked the roads across the earth's breast for a thousand years. Ananda Lal also used present perfect tense : I have walked the paths of earth for thousands of years. Now the translation by Joydeep Bhattacharya : I have walked earth's byways for millennia. Fakrul Alam followed suit by writing : For a thousand years I have walked the ways of the world.\n\nOn the contrary Clinton B. Seely used simple past tense : For thousands of years I roamed the paths of this earth. Joe Winter translated : For thousands of years Earth's path has been my path. This is in line with Jibanananda Das himself who translated like : Long I have been a wanderer of this world. Anjana Basu's translation is not comparable here and hence excluded.\n\nIt is Anupam Banerji who maintained the literal sense of the poem (1998) and wrote in translation : For ages I have been walking the paths of this earth. A recent translation by Arun Sarkar again considers present perfect continuous tense : For thousand years I have been walking all over the world. Recently, a translation by Shamik Bose, runs like 'For a thousand years I have been walking upon the bosom of my earth'.\n\nIn 2008, Clinton B. Seely improved on his original translation and used present perfect continuous tense.\n\nSeveral translations of this poem are available in Hindi. Translations by Prayag Shukla, Sameer Baran Nandi and Nirmal Kumar Chakraborty are notable ones. Almost unknown in literary circles, Sushil Kumar Jha has also attempted to translate Banalata Sen into Hindi retaining the essence of the poem in its true spirit.\n\n\n"}

He succeeded Turkmenistan's first president for life, Saparmurat Niyazov, when Niyazov died in 2006 after a reign of 15 years. In the 2017 election Berdimuhamedow received 98% of the country's popular vote against eight other candidates, and has now reigned for over years. The country passed reforms in 2016 eliminating term limits for the presidency and removing the previous age requirement of below 70, as well as extending the term from five to seven years.

It officially ended the Latvian War of Independence.\n\nIn Article II of the treaty, Soviet Russia recognised the independence of Latvia as inviolable \"for all future time\".\n\n\nAfter World War I, Soviet Russia wanted to regain Latvia, since it had once been a part of the Russian Empire. The Red Army invaded Latvia in 1918 after the Latvian prime minister, Karlis Ulmanis, declared its independence. The Red Army was able to capture the capital, Riga, and a Soviet Government replaced Ulmanis. Germany sent troops to help Latvia oust the Bolshevik troops, but after this was accomplished the Germans refused to leave, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. After the Estonian Army 3rd Division and the Latvians expelled the German troops, the Soviet troops once again advanced onto Riga. These troops were pushed out of Latvia by early 1920. A Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty then formally ended Latvia's War for Independence.\n\nThe treaty had twenty-three articles and dealt with the sovereignty of the state of Latvia. The first article stated that \"The state of war existing between the Parties shall be ended as of the effective date of this Peace Treaty.\" Article 2 declared the independence and sovereignty of Latvia and Article 3 set the borders of the State of Latvia, while also creating deadlines by which foreign troops should leave. Articles 4-6 dealt with military affairs and war damage, Article 7 with provisions for the return of prisoners of war, should they desire to return. Articles 8 through 9 concerned citizenship, repatriation of refugees, and property claims. Adults aged 18 or older were free to choose either Latvian or Russian citizenship, the default being that individuals were citizens of the state in which they resided at the time the treaty was signed. Articles 11 through 16 dealt with reparations Russia was to make to the Latvian state and its citizens. Articles 17 and 18 dealt with commercial, transit, postal and navigation arrangements and Article 19 with diplomatic relations. Article 20 address nationality issues and Article 21 established a commission to handle issues of mutual interest. Articles 22 and 23 deal with treaty technicalities such as language and ratification.\n\nWhile the treaty included provisions for reparations, Latvia had no practical recourse for recovering its industrial infrastructure, much of which had been taken to Russia. Agriculture and the requisite land reform became the focus for economic development in the new state.\n\n\n"}

It includes the northern portion of the San Joaquin Valley (which itself is the southern portion of the Central Valley, beginning at the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta), the Central Coast, the central hills of the California Coast Ranges, and the foothills and mountain areas of the central Sierra Nevada.\n\nCentral California is considered to be west of the crest of the Sierra Nevada. (East of the Sierras is Eastern California.) The largest cities in the region (over 50,000 population), from most to least populous, are Fresno, Bakersfield, Stockton, Modesto, Salinas, Visalia, Clovis, Santa Maria, Merced, Turlock, Madera, Lodi, Tulare, Porterville, Hanford, and Delano.\n\nCentral California can have widely varying definitions depending on the context. Some divide the state by lines of latitude making northern, central and southern sections. Others divide by county lines or watershed boundaries. Some definitions include more of the San Joaquin Valley and even larger portions of the Central Valley. Some have less or none of Central Coast.\n\nGenerally the widest definition of central California is the middle third of the state by latitude. The southern boundary of that area would be 35° 41', which nearly coincides with the county lines already used for the southern boundary that cross the state west-to-east below Monterey, Kings and Tulare Counties. The northern boundary of that area at 38° 51' crosses just north of the Sacramento metro area. However, the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento metro areas are traditionally considered parts of Northern California, intuitively grouped together as the northern urban center within the state. That leaves the most accepted definitions of central California to the areas south of there.\n\nCentral California as defined above includes the following 16 counties:\nArea cities and towns listed below are major regional centers or county seats.\n\nThe following regions are entirely contained within central California:\n\nThe following regions are partly contained within central California:\n\nCentral California has opened two new universities recently, one in each of the past two decades.\n\nThe University of California has one campus in the region. University of California, Merced opened on a newly constructed site on the east side of Merced in 2005.\n\nThe California State University system has four campuses in the region. California State University, Monterey Bay opened on the site of the former Fort Ord army base in 1994. California State University, Stanislaus in Turlock opened in 1957. California State University, Fresno opened in 1911.\n\nThe Monterey Institute of International Studies is a graduate school that offers eleven master's degree programs in international policy, international management, language teaching, and translation and interpretation. The Monterey Institute of International Studies is a graduate school of Middlebury College.\n\nSan Joaquin College of Law is a private, nonprofit law school located in Clovis.\n\nFresno Pacific University is a private university in Fresno.\n\nThe Naval Postgraduate School and Defense Language Institute are located in Monterey.\n\nThe following community college campus sites are in the region:\n\nThere are no community colleges in Madera, Mariposa or San Benito Counties.\n\nMost of the major highways in the region run north-south around the mountains. Interstate 5 and State Route 99 are the primary highways in the San Joaquin Valley. US 101 and State Route 1 are the major coastal highways.\nPassenger rail in the region consists of the Amtrak long-haul Coast Starlight and Amtrak California San Joaquin routes.\n\nThe California High-Speed Rail system is under planning. If built, it would have stations in Fresno and Merced on the initial line between San Francisco/San Jose and Los Angeles.\n\nFreight rail is served by commercial railroads.

{"id": "2049538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049538", "title": "Keep Yourself Alive", "text": "Keep Yourself Alive\n\n\"Keep Yourself Alive\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. Written by guitarist Brian May, it is the opening track on the band's eponymous debut album (1973). It was released as Queen's first single along with \"Son and Daughter\" as the B-side. \"Keep Yourself Alive\" was largely ignored upon its release and failed to chart on either side of the Atlantic. It was also re-released as the non-album B-side of \"Lily of the Valley\" in 1974.\n\nIn 2008, \"Rolling Stone Magazine\" rated the song 31st on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\".\n\nAccording to Mark Hodkinson, author of \"Queen: The Early Years\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\" was conceived on acoustic guitars during Queen's practice sessions at Imperial College and the garden at Ferry Road in 1970. At the time, Queen had not yet found a permanent bassist; the group consisted of lead singer Freddie Mercury, guitarist May, and drummer Roger Taylor. In a radio special about their 1977 album \"News of the World\", May said he had penned the lyrics thinking of them as ironic and tongue-in-cheek, but their sense was completely changed when Mercury sang them.\n\nThe first version of \"Keep Yourself Alive\" was recorded in summer 1971 at De Lane Lea Studios. It was produced by Louie Austin and includes the intro played on Brian May's Hairfred acoustic guitar. All of the song elements were already present, including call-and-response vocals by Mercury (verses) and during the break, where Taylor sang a line and May answered it. This demo version remains May's favourite take of the song.\n\nSubsequently they did several attempts to \"recapture the magic\" when they went on to do the \"real\" version at the famous Trident Studios. The one mixed by Mike Stone was the only one moderately accepted, and it is the one released as a single. It includes Mercury doing all of the harmony vocals in the chorus (multi-tracking himself) and May singing the \"two steps nearer to my grave\" line instead of Mercury (who did it live and in earlier versions). This recording does not use acoustic guitar; the printed transcription on EMI Music Publishing's \"Off the Record\"' sheet music lists at least seven electric guitar parts, one of which uses a prominent phasing effect. It can also be noted that this recording includes the line \"Come on and get it, get it, get it, boy, keep yourself alive,\" which was not in the original version.\n\nThe newly formed Queen quickly added \"Keep Yourself Alive\" to their live set. Mercury commented that the song \"was a very good way of telling people what Queen was about in those days\" (RAM, 21 May 1976, p 17). Indeed, the number included a drum solo by Taylor and one line sung/spoken by him.\n\n\"Keep Yourself Alive\" was part of the band's live set until the early 1980s. On the 1980 and 1981 tours, the band would play an improvisational jam before the start of the song then after the drum solo, it would morph into Taylor's tympani drum solo followed by May's echo-plexed guitar solo spot before either segueing into the \"Brighton Rock\" finale or a drum and guitar climax or segued into a \"Flash Gordon\" medley (which consisted of \"Battle Theme\"/\"Flash's Theme\"/\"The Hero\"). The band would not play it again until 1984 on \"The Works\" tour as part of a medley of old songs (with \"Somebody to Love\", \"Killer Queen\", \"Seven Seas of Rhye\", and \"Liar\").\n\nIn live performances, Mercury would often sing the line \"all you people keep yourself alive\" (which is sung only two times in the studio version) in place of the more-repeated line \"take you all your time and a money honey you'll survive\". \n\nThe song also appears on 1989 live album \"At the Beeb\", originally recorded for BBC Radio 1's programme \"Sound of the 70s\" in 1973. Though not released until much later, this live studio recording predates Queen's eponymous debut and presents a version of \"Keep Yourself Alive\" more in line with that of their live set. \n\nEMI Records released \"Keep Yourself Alive\" as a single in the United Kingdom on 6 July 1973, a week before \"Queen\" hit the stores. A few months later, on 9 October 1973, Elektra Records released the single in the United States. However, \"Keep Yourself Alive\" received little radio airplay and was largely ignored on both sides of the Atlantic; it failed to chart in either the UK or the US. According to Queen biographer Mark Hodkinson, although \"[o]n five separate occasions EMI's pluggers attempted to secure it space on [Britain's Radio 1] play list\", they were denied each time, reportedly because the record \"took too long to happen\". \"Keep Yourself Alive\" remains the only Queen single not to have charted in the UK.\n\nThe single received mixed reviews from the British music press. \"New Musical Express\" praised the \"cleanly recorded\" song, as well as the \"[g]ood singer\", and quipped that if Queen \"look half as good as they sound, they could be huge\". The reviewer for \"Melody Maker\" felt that Queen \"[made] an impressive debut with a heavily phased guitar intro and energetic vocal attack\"; however, he thought the song to be unoriginal, and unlikely to become a hit. On the other hand, \"Disc\" magazine's critic believed the single \"should do well\". The review praised \"Keep Yourself Alive\"'s drum solo, as well as its \"attractively stilted, vaguely Hendrix-y lead riff\". The \"South Yorkshire Times\" rated the single as \"good\"; the newspaper predicted that \"[i]f this debut sound from Queen is anything to go by, they should make very interesting listening in the future.\" In his album review of \"Queen\" for \"Rolling Stone Magazine\", Gordon Fletcher hailed \"Keep Yourself Alive\" as \"a truly awesome move for the jugular\".\n\nRetrospectively, \"Keep Yourself Alive\" is cited as the highlight of Queen's debut album. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that while \"Queen\" \"too often . . . plays like a succession of ideas instead of succinct songs\", \"[t]here is an exception to that rule — the wild, rampaging opener 'Keep Yourself Alive,' one of their very best songs\". In 2008, \"Rolling Stone Magazine\" rated the song 31st on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\". The magazine dubbed \"Keep Yourself Alive\" as \"Brian May's statement of purpose: a phalanx of overdubbed guitars crying out in unison, with rhythm and texture from over-the-top effects. . . . an entire album's worth of riffs crammed into a single song.\"\n\n\nA: \"Keep Yourself Alive\" (Brian May) – 3:47\nB: \"Son and Daughter\" (May) – 3:21\n\nA: \"Keep Yourself Alive\" (May) – 3:47\nB: \"Son and Daughter\" (May) [censored version] – 3:12\n\nA: \"Keep Yourself Alive\" (May) [US single edit] – 3:29\nB: \"Lily of the Valley\" (Freddie Mercury)/\"God Save the Queen\" (traditional, arr.

The band was formed in 1990 by Danny Spencer (vocals, keyboards) and Ric Peet (keyboards).\n\nThe duo had a top 10 UK hit single with an electronic cover of The Beatles' \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" in 1990. The track sampled the drum beat from James Brown's \"Funky Drummer\", overdubbing a hi hat and heavy reverb. Candy Flip's track was initially a club hit on the rave scene before crossing over into the pop chart. The track is now considered a \"rave classic\", and was reissued on vinyl in 2005 on S12 Records. The UK DJ remix service Disco Mix Club remixed the Candy Flip version, removing the beat and adding an interpolation of \"Hey Jude\" to the outro.\n\nThe B-side of the first 12\" single contained another electronic track entitled \"Can You Feel the Love\". A second 12\" single release featured the \"Raspberry Ripple Remix\" of the lead track backed by \"Rhythim of Love\" (sic).\n\nIn 1991, Candy Flip released their first album, \"Madstock...\", which combined rave beats with synthpop, strongly influenced by bands such as the Pet Shop Boys, New Order and the Beloved. A further two singles were released, the first being \"Space\" which made UK No. 98 and \"This Can Be Real\", which fared slightly better, reaching UK No. 60. Candy Flip split up in 1992.\n\nPeet became a record producer and engineer, working with bands such as the Charlatans and Six by Seven.\n\nSpencer, together with his brother Kelvin Andrews went on to form Sound 5, releasing the album \"No Illicit Dancing\" in 2000 on Gut Records, as well as providing remixes for other artists such as UK band Space.\n\nMore recently, Spencer and Andrews (as Soul Mekanik) produced four songs on the Robbie Williams album, \"Rudebox\" (2006).

It was one of the six newly created state funded normal schools that were designed to provide four years of \"preparatory\" (or high school) study, followed by two years of college work towards teacher certification. The school's establishment was the product of the intense lobbying efforts of the 25,000 Club, a local booster group. The club raised funds for faculty salaries so classes could begin that fall in local churches and public school classrooms. Graduates of the normal school program received lifetime teaching certification statewide. The 1910 Oklahoma Legislature funded faculty salaries and the construction of a building on a site donated by a Chickasaw allottee. In 1919, the normal schools were authorized by the Oklahoma Legislature to offer four years of teacher education, to offer bachelor's degrees, and were designated teachers' colleges.\n\nExpanding beyond education degrees, in 1939 the school became East Central State College. Fifteen years later, the regional colleges were allowed to offer graduate degrees. By 1974, the state legislature renamed the state colleges, and it became East Central Oklahoma State University—a name it retained until 1985 when it gained its present name.\n\nECU serves around 4,000 students and is perhaps best known internationally for its cartography program, as only a few such programs exist.

He first became acquainted with the tar, but later started to learn to play the violin. As soon as Ali-Naqi Vaziri established his School of Music, Khāleghi left school and joined Vaziri's school, where he studied for eight years. Soon he became his master's assistant and was placed in charge of teaching music theory. He later continued his education and obtained a BA degree in Persian Language and Literature from the University of Tehran.\n\nIn 1944 Khāleghi established the National Music Society and in 1949, thanks to the efforts of this great artist, the School of National Music was founded. After his first journey to the former U.S.S.R. in 1955, he became involved in the Iran-Soviet Society and was selected as a member of its board of directors.\n\nHe also began to serve as the director of the Payām-e-Novin Magazine. His work, The \"History of Persian Music\", which was published in two volumes, took shape during these years. His other published works include: \"Harmony of Western Music\", \"Theory of Eastern Music\", and \"Theory of Persian Music\".\n\nFor many years Khāleghi worked as a musical advisor for Radio Iran and was one of the founders of the program known as \"Gol'hā\" (Flowers). He also conducted the \"Gol'hā\" Orchestra, for which he composed many pieces and revised the original compositions of his contemporaries as well as older masters, such as Āref and Sheydā. Although revised, the compositions retained all their original characteristics.\n\nKhāleghi's compositions are not limited to what he wrote for \"Gol'hā\". In addition to such masterpieces as \"Mey-e Nāb\" (Pure Wine), \"Āh-e Sahar\" (Sigh at Dawn), \"Hālā Cherā\" (Why Now?), and \"Chang-e Rudaki\" (Rudaki's Harp), he composed many other lyrical pieces and hymns, which were mostly patriotic. These include such works as \"Ey Iran\" (see Gholām-Hossein Banān) and the Hymn for Azarbaijan. Khāleghi established The \"National Music Society\" and \"Persian National Music Conservatory\" in 1949 in Tehran.\n\nHe believed Persian classical music must turn into a polyphonic music to become more attractive.\n\nHe died in 1965 in Salzburg, Austria and was buried in Zahir o-dowleh cemetery, Darband, Tehran.\n\n\n"}

The dish is eaten with chopsticks and a soup spoon and can be eaten by itself or served with a bowl of steamed rice, noodles or rice vermicelli. Another variation of this dish would be to serve it with \"laksa\" gravy or curry sauce. Essential accompaniments are a spicy, vinegary chili sauce, originally made with red fermented bean curd and distantly similar in taste to Sriracha sauce, and a distinctive brown sweet bean sauce or hoisin sauce for dipping.\n\nIn Malaysia, particularly the Klang Valley, yong tau foo is often associated with the city of Ampang, Selangor, just outside the eastern end of Kuala Lumpur.\n\n"}

The league expanded to 26 teams with the addition of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and the Florida Panthers. The New York Rangers were the Stanley Cup champions. It was the Rangers' fourth championship overall, and their first in 54 seasons, since 1939–40.\n\nThe spectacular play of Dominik Hasek of the Buffalo Sabres ushered in a new era of goaltending dominance in the NHL. Only three teams reached the 300-goal plateau, and only one team, the Detroit Red Wings, averaged more than four goals scored per game. Goaltenders combined for 99 shutouts during the regular season, a mark that broke the all-time regular-season record of 85 set in 1974–75.\nFor this season, the names of the conferences were changed from Campbell and Wales to Western and Eastern respectively, and the divisions' names were changed from Adams, Patrick, Norris, and Smythe to Northeast, Atlantic, Central, and Pacific respectively. Each division had changes. The Northeast Division would welcome the Pittsburgh Penguins, previously from the Patrick Division. The Atlantic Division would welcome the newcomer Florida Panthers and the Tampa Bay Lightning, previously from the Norris Division. The Central Division would welcome the Winnipeg Jets, previously from the Smythe Division. The Pacific Division would welcome the newcomer Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. New league commissioner Gary Bettman, who had previously worked in the National Basketball Association (NBA), thought the old names could be confusing to non-traditional fans and believed that a change to geographically-named divisions, as used in the NBA and most other North American professional sports, would be more easily understandable to new fans.\n\nIn addition, the playoff format was changed to a conference based seeding over division specific brackets: the division winners were seeded one-two by order of point finish, then the top six remaining teams in the conference were seeded three through eight. However, unlike the NBA, the NHL matched the highest-seeded winners against the lowest-seeded winners in the second round. In order to reduce the number of long trips to and from the West Coast, whenever a Central Division team played a Pacific Division team in the playoffs, the format was 2–3–2 rather than the traditional 2–2–1–1–1, a format that was only used for the 1993–94 season.\n\n\nThe Panthers and Mighty Ducks set new records for first-year expansion teams. Both teams finished with 33 wins, surpassing the 31 wins of the Philadelphia Flyers and Los Angeles Kings in 1967–68. That mark would not be topped by another expansion team until the Vegas Golden Knights notched their 34th win in their inaugural season on February 1, 2018, finishing with 51 wins. The Panthers also set a high-water mark in points, with 83 points, surpassing the previous record set by the Flyers' 73 points in 1968. The Golden Knights would eventually shatter this inaugural expansion team record by 26 points notching a total of 109 points in 2017-18.\n\nThe division first-place finishers qualify for the playoffs as 1-2 seeding.

{"id": "2049650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049650", "title": "What Is History?", "text": "What Is History?\n\nWhat Is History? is a 1961 non-fiction book by historian Edward Hallett Carr on historiography. It discusses history, facts, the bias of historians, science, morality, individuals and society, and moral judgements in history.\n\nThe book originated in a series of lectures given by Carr in 1961 at the University of Cambridge. The lectures were intended as a broad introduction into the subject of the theory of history and their accessibility has resulted in \"What is History?\" becoming one of the key texts in the field of historiography.\n\nSome of Carr's ideas are contentious, particularly his relativism and his rejection of contingency as an important factor in historical analysis. His work provoked a number of responses, most notably Geoffrey Elton's \"The Practice of History\".\n\nCarr was in the process of revising \"What is History?\" for a second edition at the time of his death.\n\nCarr's opinions about the nature of historical work in \"What Is History?\" were controversial. In his 1967 book \"The Practice of History\", Sir Geoffrey Elton criticized Carr for his \"whimsical\" distinction between the \"historical facts\" and the \"facts of the past\", saying that it reflected \"an extraordinarily arrogant attitude both to the past and to the place of the historian studying it\". Elton praised Carr for rejecting the role of \"accidents\" in history, but said Carr's philosophy of history was an attempt to provide a secular version of the medieval view of history as the working of God's master plan with \"Progress\" playing the part of God.\n\nBritish historian Hugh Trevor-Roper said Carr's dismissal of the \"might-have-beens of history\" reflected a fundamental lack of interest in examining historical causation. Trevor-Roper said examining possible alternative outcomes of history is not a \"parlour-game\", but is an essential part of historians' work. Trevor-Roper said historians could properly understand the period under study only by looking at all possible outcomes and all sides; historians who adopted Carr's perspective of only seeking to understand the winners of history and treating the outcome of a particular set of events as the only possible outcomes, were \"bad historians\".\n\nIn a review in 1963 in \"Historische Zeitschrift\", Andreas Hillgruber wrote favourably of Carr's \"geistvoll-ironischer\" (ironically spirited) criticism of conservative, liberal and positivist historians. British philosopher W.H. Walsh said in a 1963 review that it is not a \"fact of history\" that he had toast for breakfast that day. Walsh said Carr was correct that historians did not stand above history, and were instead products of their own places and times, which in turn decided what \"facts of the past\" they determined into \"facts of history\".\n\nBritish historian Richard J. Evans said \"What Is History?\" caused a revolution in British historiography in the 1960s. Australian historian Keith Windschuttle, a critic of Carr, said \"What Is History?\" is one of the most influential books written about historiography, and that very few historians working in the English language since the 1960s had not read it.\n\n"}

It was designed as a high dependability OS in which the kernel, device drivers, and application software were all written in managed code. Internal security uses type safety instead of hardware memory protection.\n\nThe lowest-level x86 interrupt dispatch code is written in assembly language and C. Once this code has done its job, it invokes the kernel, which runtime system and garbage collector are written in Sing# (an extended version of Spec#, itself an extension of C#) and runs in unprotected mode. The hardware abstraction layer is written in C++ and runs in protected mode. There is also some C code to handle debugging. The computer's basic input/output system (BIOS) is invoked during the 16-bit real mode bootstrap stage; once in 32-bit mode, Singularity never invokes the BIOS again, but invokes device drivers written in Sing#. During installation, Common Intermediate Language (CIL) opcodes are compiled into x86 opcodes using the Bartok compiler.\n\nSingularity is a microkernel operating system. Unlike most historic microkernels, its components execute in the same address space (process), which contains \"software-isolated processes\" (SIPs). Each SIP has its own data and code layout, and is independent from other SIPs. These SIPs behave like normal processes, but avoid the cost of task-switches.\n\nProtection in this system is provided by a set of rules called invariants that are verified by static program analysis. For example, in the memory-invariant states there must be no cross-references (or memory pointers) between two SIPs; communication between SIPs occurs via higher-order communication channels managed by the operating system. Invariants are checked during installation of the application. (In Singularity, installation is managed by the operating system.)\n\nMost of the invariants rely on the use of safer memory-managed languages, such as Sing#, which have a garbage collector, allow no arbitrary pointers, and allow code to be verified to meet a given computer security policy.\n\nSingularity 1.0 was completed in 2007. A Singularity Research Development Kit (RDK) was released under a shared source license allowing academic non-commercial use, and is available from CodePlex. Version 1.1 was released in March 2007 and version 2.0 was released on November 14, 2008.\n\n\n\n"}

Its economy was heavily based on agriculture due to the fertile soil in the area.\n\nBy the seventeenth century, the Ñuñoa area kept its agricultural character, however the development of a road system that had strengthened its ties with the city of Santiago began. During the nineteenth century there were a number of changes and developments that modified the purely rural character of Ñuñoa and Macul, some of the more prevalent changes were the construction of railways, housing developments and the enactment of the Autonomous Commune Law.\n\nSince 1930, Ñuñoa has been strengthening its residential character, and due to its very accessible infrastructure for transportation and communications with the rest of the city, it has now developed as a largely industrialized settlement, with a good number of factories making their home in Ñuñoa.\n\nBeginning in 1960, the territory of Macul seizes to be an urban expansion area to the city of Santiago, reaching critical mass and the maximum for developing land as an urban area, reaching its 100% developed status. This proclamation ended in the early 1970s with the opening of the Américo Vespucio Ringroad, allowing for further development.\n\nIn 1981, Ñuñoa was subdivided into three communes: Ñuñoa, Peñalolén and Macul. It wasn't until 1984 when Macul officially became a municipality and began to operate. The municipality is now allowed to exercise its authority over the fully urbanized territory of all three communes. Macul had a significant industrial sector before combining with the commune of Ñuñoa.\n\nSince 1992, the municipal authorities are elected every four years via popular vote.\n\nAs a commune, Macul is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is elected by popular vote every four years. The 2012-2016 alcalde is Sergio Puyol Carreño (PDC). The communal council has the following members:\n\nThe commune is divided into twenty neighbourhood units, which are divided into assemblies and include participation from neighbours in the same area or district. They find solutions for common problems and concerns. \n\nWithin the electoral divisions of Chile, Macul is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Felipe Salaberry (UDI) and Ximena Vidal (PPD) as part of the 25th electoral district, (together with San Joaquín and La Granja). The commune is represented in the Senate by Soledad Alvear (PDC) and Pablo Longueira (UDI) as part of the 8th senatorial constituency (Santiago-East).\n\nThe community of Macul is home to the San Joaquín Campus of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, which is located on the eastern side of Vicuña Mackenna Avenue. The campus hosts several faculties and featured labs, libraries, casinos and sport fields of excellent quality. Three buildings on campus were designed by architect Alejandro Aravena, the 2016 laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize.\n\nMacul is also home to the athletic campus of the University of the Americas called Campus One (Sports Complex UDLA). This campus is the result of the union of ONE, a company of Hans Gildemeister, and Universidad de Las Americas, to promote physical activity within the University community.\n\nAnother higher education institution with facilities in Macul is INACAP, which replaced the former facilities of Colón and Tabancura Streets. The campus in Macul is the largest campus in Chil built by INACAP, with more than of floor space on of land. The INACAP campus is located at the intersection of Vicuña Mackenna Avenue and Escuela Agricola Street.\n\nAmong the attractions of the commune we can find the Aquatic Club Macul, the Estadio Monumental David Arellano owned by the most popular Chilean football team, Colo-Colo, and the training center of the Chilean football team Juan Pinto Durán. Departmental and Creole restaurant grill \"Donde la Cuca\" which is characterised by its pleasing atmosphere and live music is one of the biggest night clubs in Santiago, located in Luxor Disco avenue . The Vasquez Palace, also known as \"The Macul Castle\", is a beautiful palace located in the center of the community, besides being a popular tourist attraction, the palace also serves as the administration's main office.\n\nAccording to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Macul spans an area of and has 112,535 inhabitants (53,667 men and 58,868 women), making the commune an entirely urban area.

This passion for acoustic music was especially stirred by the Davey Graham album \"Folk Blues and Beyond\". He played his first gig when he was fourteen in a band called Retrospect with Richard Entwistle, John Allman and Martin Pike and other musicians, and by the time he was sixteen he was performing regularly. Beer worked with Paul Downes as a duo from 1974 and also in the Arizona Smoke Revue 1980. He was a key member of Johnny Coppin's band (ex-Decameron), and together they collaborated with Nigel Mazlyn Jones on his 1979 \"Sentinel\" album. He toured with Mike Oldfield in 1979 and also recorded some tracks at Oldfield's Througham studio. Beer joined The Albion Band in 1984 and stayed with them until 1991, touring extensively at home and abroad, and recording many albums. Show of Hands became a full-time partnership from 1991. Beer continues to do session work, most notably on The Rolling Stones' \"Steel Wheels\" album, Steve Harley's \"Poetic Justice\" and countless other mainstream and less high-profile projects.

The British, with the allied Nizam of Hyderabad and Maratha, achieved a decisive victory after breaching the walls of the fortress at Seringapatam and storming the citadel. Tipu Sultan, Mysore's ruler, was killed in the action. The British restored the Wodeyar dynasty to the throne after the victory, but retained indirect control of the kingdom. The leader of the British troops was Major General David Baird.\n\nThe battle consisted of a series of encounters around Seringapatam (the anglicised version of Srirangapatnam) in the months of April and May 1799, between the combined forces of the British East India Company and their allies, numbering over 50,000 soldiers in all, and the soldiers of the Kingdom of Mysore, ruled by Tipu Sultan, numbering up to 30,000. The Fourth Anglo-Mysore War came to an end with the defeat and death of Tipu Sultan in the battle.\n\nWhen the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War broke out, the British assembled two large columns under General George Harris. The first consisted of over 26,000 British East India Company troops, 4,000 of whom were European while the rest were local Indian sepoys. The second column was supplied by the Nizam of Hyderabad, and consisted of ten battalions and over 16,000 cavalry. Together, the allied force numbered over 50,000 soldiers. Tipu's forces had been depleted by the Third Anglo-Mysore War and the consequent loss of half his kingdom, but he still probably had up to 30,000 soldiers.\n\nThe British forces consisted of the following:\n\n\nThe Indian (sepoy) forces consisted of the following:\n\nSeringapatam was besieged by the British forces on 5 April 1799. The River Cauvery, which flowed around the city of Seringapatam, was at its lowest level of the year and could be forded by infantry — if an assault commenced before the monsoon. When letters were exchanged with Tipu, it seemed that he was playing for time. He requested two persons to be sent to him for discussions and also stated that he was preoccupied with hunting expeditions. Tipu Sultan's Chief Minister, Mir Sadiq, is alleged to have been bought over by the British. The British had sought the assistance of Mir Sadiq who, like Purnaiya and Qamar-ud-din Khan, had been for sometime past carrying on correspondence with the English against his master(p. 313).\n\nThe Governor-General of India, Richard Wellesley, planned the opening of a breach in the walls of Seringapatam. The location of the breach, as noted by Beatson, the author of an account of the Fourth Mysore War, was 'in the west curtain, a little to the right of the flank of the north-west bastion. This being the old rampart appeared weaker than the new.' The Mysorean defence succeeded in preventing the establishment of a battery on the north side of the River Cauvery on 22 April 1799. However, by 1 May, working at night, the British had completed their southern batteries and brought them up to the wall. At sunrise on 2 May, the batteries of the Nizam of Hyderabad succeeded in opening a practical breach in the outer wall. In addition, the mines that were laid under the breach were hit by artillery and blew up prematurely.\n\nThe leader of the British troops was Major General David Baird, an implacable enemy of Tipu Sultan: twenty years earlier, he had been held captive for 44 months. The storming troops, including men of the 73rd and 74th regiments, clambered up the breach and fought their way along the ramparts.\n\nOn the night of May 3 some officers crossed over to the glacis, examined the breach and the manner of attacking the fort (Lushington, \"Life of Harris\", p. 325). It was probably on this occasion that it was arranged between the English officers and Mir Sadiq that the assault should take place at midday(p.313). \n\nThe assault was to begin at 1:00 p.m. to coincide with the hottest part of the day when the defenders would be taking refreshment. Led by two forlorn-hopes, two columns would advance upon the defences around the breach, then wheel right and left to take over the fortifications. A third reserve column, commanded by Arthur Wellesley, would deploy as required to provide support where needed.\n\nAt 11:00 a.m., on 4 May 1799, the British troops were briefed and whiskey and a biscuit issued to the European soldiers, before the signal to attack was given. The forlorn-hopes, numbering seventy-six men, led the charge. The columns quickly formed, were ordered to fix bayonets, and began to move forward. \n\nAs the hour approached, Mir Sadiq withdrew the troops stationed at the breach under the pretext of distributing their pay. There was no one to protest against such a measure. Sayyid Abdul Ghaffar, who was very loyal to the Sultan, was killed by a cannon ball. Immediately after the Sayyid was killed, the traitors made a signal from the fort holding out a white handkerchief to the English troops who were assembled in the trenches, waiting for such a signal p.313-314). \n\nThe storming party dashed across the River Cauvery in water four feet deep, with covering fire from British batteries, and within 16 minutes had scaled the ramparts and swept aside the defenders quickly. The British follow-up columns turned right and left, sweeping along the inside of the walls until they met on the far side of the city.\n\nTipu's Tiger, an automaton now in the Victoria & Albert Museum, was captured at Seringapatam.\n\nThe column that rounded the northwest corner of the outer wall was immediately involved in a serious fight with a group of Mysorean warriors under a fat officer, which defended every traverse. The officer was observed to be discharging hunting weapons, loaded and passed to him by servants, at the British.

Ang was the only son in his family and he had four sisters. He was originally intended to be named Ang Hua Shing (\"Hua Shing\" literally means \"Chinese-born\") but did not push through with the plan upon learning that his cousin was given the name by his uncle.\n\nAng was taught by a commercial artist at a young age on how to make charcoal portrait. His influence at the time was the artworks of Qi Baishi. After World War II, the family moved to Cotabato. Ang made movie billboards here and later his family moved to Manila, where he attended the University of Santo Tomas where one of his mentors was Vicente Manansala. He studied in the university from 1952 to 1954.\n\nAng's first formal recognition in his career as an artist was when his work \"Calesa\" garnered third place at the Shell National Students Art Competition in 1953. In 1954, he launched his first one-man show at the Contemporary Arts Gallery after he was urged by his mentor Manansala. Within a few years his works such as garnered him more recognition such as \"Still Life (1951, Honorable mention), \"The Bird\" (1959, First Prize), \"Still Life in Red\" (1963, Third Prize), \" Fish\" (1963, Second Prize), and \"Geometric Still-Life Fish\" (1963, Second Prize). All of these recognition was from the Art Association of the Philippines.\n\nHe first attained prominence in the Philippine arts scene in the 1960s with a distinct style that fused influences from cubism, surrealism and expressionism. Some classified his style as \"figurative expressionism\", others merely called it ugly. What could not be doubted was the violence in his imagery, a factor that slighted the commercial viability of his works until the 1980s. He favored such subjects as fighting cocks, rabid dogs, and people enraptured by rage or bound in chains. As someone who has a Catholic background, he painted multiple depictions of the crucified Christ that did not shirk from portraying the agonies normally associated with the crucifixion. When asked why he was so angry, he replied, \"\"Why not? Open your eyes. Look around you. So much anger, sorrow, ugliness. And also madness.\"\" The intensity of his works stood in contrast to his own personality, described as \"placid and affable\".\n\nAng was conferred the honor of being a National Artist for Visual Arts in 2001, by virtue of Presidential Proclamation No. 32, s. 2001, which was signed on April 20, 2001. The ceremonial conferment of the honor to Ang and three other artists - F. Sionil Jose (literature), Ishmael Bernal (film) and Severino Montano (theater arts) - was held on June 11, 2001.\n\nIn the end, Ang emerged not only as a critical favorite, but a commercially popular artist as well. Upon his death from cancer on May 9, 2005, it was reported that he and fellow National Artist Fernando Amorsolo were the most widely bidded after Filipino painters in auctions.\n\n"}
{"id": "2049749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049749", "title": "Nationalist historiography", "text": "Nationalist historiography\n\nHistoriography is the study of how history is written. One pervasive influence upon the writing of history has been nationalism, a set of beliefs about political legitimacy and cultural identity. Nationalism has provided a significant framework for historical writing in Europe and in those former colonies influenced by Europe since the nineteenth century. According to the medieval historian Patrick J. Geary:\n\n[The] modern [study of] history was born in the nineteenth century, conceived and developed as an instrument of European nationalism. As a tool of nationalist ideology, the history of Europe's nations was a great success, but it has turned our understanding of the past into a toxic waste dump, filled with the poison of ethnic nationalism, and the poison has seeped deep into popular consciousness.\n\nAlthough the emergence of the nation into political consciousness is often placed in the nineteenth century, attempts by political leaders to craft new national identities, with their dynasty at the center, have been identified as early as the late Roman Empire. The Barbarian rulers of the successor states crafted these new identities on the basis of descent of the ruler from ancient noble families, a shared descent of a single people with common language, custom, and religious identity, and a definition in law of the rights and responsibilities of members of the new nation.\n\nThe eighteenth and nineteenth century saw the resurgence of national ideologies. During the French revolution a national identity was crafted, identifying the common people with the Gauls. In Germany historians and humanists, such as Johann Gottfried Herder and Johann Gottlieb Fichte, identified a linguistic and cultural identity of the German nation, which became the basis of a political movement to unite the fragmented states of this German nation.\n\nA significant historiographical outcome of this movement of German nationalism was the formation of a \"Society for Older German Historical Knowledge\", which sponsored the editing of a massive collection of documents of German history, the \"Monumenta Germaniae Historica\". The sponsors of the \"MGH\", as it is commonly known, defined German history very broadly; they edited documents concerning all territories where German-speaking people had once lived or ruled. Thus, documents from Italy to France to the Baltic were grist for the mill of the \"MGH\" editors.\n\nThis model of scholarship focusing on detailed historical and linguistic investigations of the origins of a nation, set by the founders of the \"MGH\", was imitated throughout Europe. In this framework, historical phenomena were interpreted as they related to the development of the nation-state; the state was projected into the past. National histories are thus expanded to cover everything that has ever happened within the largest extent of the expansion of a nation, turning Mousterian hunter-gatherers into incipient Frenchmen. Conversely, historical developments spanning many current countries may be ignored, or analysed from narrow parochial viewpoints.\n\nThe difficulty faced by any national history is the changeable nature of ethnicity. That one nation may turn into another nation over time, both by splitting (colonization) and by merging (syncretism, acculturation) is implicitly acknowledged by ancient writers; Herodotus describes the Armenians as \"colonists of the Phrygians\", implying that at the time of writing clearly separate groups originated as a single group. Similarly, Herodotus refers to a time when the \"Athenians were just beginning to be counted as Hellenes\", implying that a formerly Pelasgian group over time acquired \"Greekness\". The Alamanni are described by Asinius Quadratus as originally a conglomerate of various tribes which acquired a common identity over time. All these processes are summarized under the term ethnogenesis.\n\nIn ancient times, ethnicities often derived their or their rulers' origin from divine or semi-divine founders of a mythical past (for example, the Anglo-Saxons deriving their dynasties from Woden; see also Euhemerism). In modern times, such mythical aetiologies in nationalist constructions of history were replaced by the frequent attempt to link one's own ethnic group to a source as ancient as possible, often known not from tradition but only from archaeology or philology, such as Armenians claiming as their origin the Urartians, the Albanians claiming as their origin the Illyrians, the Georgians claiming as their origin the Mushki, or Hindu nationalists claiming as the origin of their religion the Indus Valley Civilization (see Indigenous Aryans (India))—all of the mentioned groups being known only from either ancient historiographers or archaeology.\n\nNationalist ideologies frequently employ results of archaeology and ancient history as propaganda, often significantly distorting them to fit their aims, cultivating national mythologies and national mysticism. Frequently this involves the uncritical identification of one's own ethnic group with some ancient or even prehistoric (known only archaeologically) group, whether mainstream scholarship accepts as plausible or reject as pseudoarchaeology the historical derivation of the contemporary group from the ancient one. The decisive point, often assumed implicitly, that it is possible to derive nationalist or ethnic pride from a population that lived millennia ago and, being known only archaeologically or epigraphically, is not remembered in living tradition.\n\nExamples include Kurds claiming identity with the Medes, Albanians claiming as their origin the Illyrians, Bulgarians claiming identity with the Thracians, Iraqi propaganda invoking Sumer or Babylonia, Georgians claiming as their origin the Mushki, Hindu nationalists claiming as their origin the Indus Valley Civilization—all of the mentioned groups being known only from either ancient historiographers or archaeology. In extreme cases, nationalists will ignore the process of ethnogenesis altogether and claim ethnic identity of their own group with some scarcely attested ancient ethnicity known to scholarship by the chances of textual transmission or archaeological excavation.\n\nHistorically, various hypotheses regarding the \"Urheimat\" of the Proto-Indo-Europeans has been a popular object of patriotic pride, quite regardless of their respective scholarly values:\n\nNationalism was so much taken for granted as the \"proper\" way to organize states and view history that nationalization of history was essentially invisible to historians until fairly recently. Then scholars such as Ernest Gellner, Benedict Anderson, and Anthony D. Smith made attempts to step back from nationalism and view it critically. Historians began to ask themselves how this ideology had affected the writing of history.\n\nSpeaking to an audience of anthropologists, the historian E. J. Hobsbawm pointed out the central role of the historical profession in the development of nationalism:\nMartin Bernal's much debated book \"Black Athena\" (1987) argues that the historiography on ancient Greece has been in part influenced by nationalism and ethnocentrism. He also claimed that influences by non-Greek or non-Indo-European cultures on Ancient Greek were marginalized.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the 14th century, it was the seat of the Courtenay family, the Earls of Devon. William Courtenay, who was the Archbishop of Canterbury from 1381 to 1396, was born here.\n\n\"Exminster\" is a major part of the electoral ward of Kenn Valley. Its population at the above census was 5,906 Exminster Marshes, to the east of the village, are a major site for birds, especially migratory ones including the rare cirl bunting.\n\nThe present parish church of Saint Martin of Tours is a Grade I listed building and was built in the late 14th and 15th centuries in the Perpendicular style. It was heavily restored in 1841 and again in 1852. It has a large three-storied tower with a polygonal stair turret. Inside, the Peamore chapel has a plaster ceiling dated 1633, depicting the Twelve Apostles and the Four Evangelists, scenes of the Nativity, Christ carrying the cross and the Resurrection. There is also a notable monument to Otho Petre of Bowhay who died in 1607.

In the episode, NASA selects Homer Simpson to participate in a spaceflight to spark public interest in space exploration and boost low ratings of the launches. Once in space, his incompetence destroys the navigation system on board the Space Shuttle.\n\nThe episode was written by showrunner David Mirkin and directed by Carlos Baeza. Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin and musician James Taylor guest-starred as themselves. The episode parodies the 1968 film \"\".\n\nSome of \"The Simpsons\"' staff, including creator Matt Groening, feared the concept was too unrealistic, resulting in some jokes being pared down and greater focus placed on relationships within the Simpson family. The episode was well-received, and many critics and fans praised it as one of the best of the series.\n\nAt the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer Simpson believes he will win the Worker of the Week award; it is a union requirement that every employee gets the prize and Homer is the only plant employee who has never won. Instead, Mr. Burns, Homer's boss, gives the award to an inanimate carbon rod instead. Homer thinks no one respects him, and watches television to lighten his mood. Suddenly, the remote breaks and the TV is stuck on a telecast of a Space Shuttle launch, which Homer finds boring. Later on at Moe's Tavern, he prank calls NASA to complain. NASA subsequently decides to send an average Joe to space to improve their Nielsen ratings and they choose Homer. But when they first approach Homer, he believes he is in trouble and blames the prank call on barfly Barney Gumble. After they invite Barney to participate in a space launch, Homer tells NASA the truth and they agree to train both of them.\n\nAt Cape Canaveral, Homer and Barney compete in training exercises. While under NASA's alcohol ban, a sober Barney develops superior skills and is chosen to fly with Buzz Aldrin and Race Banyon. After toasting with a non-alcoholic drink, Barney reverts to alcoholism and leaves via a jetpack. Homer is selected as Barney's replacement, but he grows nervous and runs away during the preparations for takeoff. Marge encourages him to take advantage of the opportunity, and he rejoins the launch; it receives good television ratings.\n\nHomer smuggles a bag of potato chips aboard the shuttle, and opens it upon reaching space. Because of the weightlessness in space, the chips disperse and clog the instruments. While eating them, Homer breaks an ant farm, and the ants destroy the navigation system. During his broadcast of the space mission, newscaster Kent Brockman erroneously believes the ants are giant aliens set to enslave Earth. Musician James Taylor, who was singing over the radio, suggests they blow the ants out the hatch. Homer fails to put on his harness and is nearly blown into space, grabbing on to the hatch handle. The hatch handle bends, preventing it from fully closing. While defending himself from a furious Race, Homer grabs a carbon rod and inadvertently uses it to seal the hatch. The shuttle returns safely to Earth, landing at a press convention. Although Buzz calls Homer a hero, the press only acknowledges the carbon rod; it appears on a \"Time\" cover and receives a ticker-tape parade. Despite this, Homer's family still celebrates him as a hero.\n\n\"Deep Space Homer\" was written by showrunner David Mirkin and directed by Carlos Baeza. He based the episode on NASA's cancellation of the Teacher in Space Project, which sent civilians to space to increase public interest in the Space Shuttle program. The staff worried that sending Homer into space was too large an idea, and \"Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening said it gave them \"nowhere to go\". Several gags were toned down to make the episode more realistic, including an idea that everyone at NASA was as stupid as Homer. Instead, Mirkin focused more on Homer's attempts to gain his family's respect.\n\nBuzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the Moon, and musician James Taylor guest-star as themselves. The staff were concerned Aldrin would consider his line \"second comes right after first\" an insult, and offered the alternative line, \"first to take a soil sample\", as a backup. Aldrin however preferred the original line, which was retained in the script. Taylor recorded an altered version of his 1970 single \"Fire and Rain\" and Carole King's 1971 \"You've Got a Friend\" for the episode. His recording session appears as an extra on the DVD release of the fifth season. David Silverman directed the potato chip sequence instead of Baeza; the chips were partly animated on an Amiga personal computer to smooth their rotation.\n\n\"Deep Space Homer\" has multiple references to the 1968 film \"\". The scene of Homer floating and eating potato chips in space includes Johann Strauss II's waltz \"The Blue Danube\", which was used in the film. Homer watches an \"Itchy and Scratchy Show\" episode that shows Itchy torturing Scratchy in an EVA pod, a reference to the film's \"Discovery\" craft. When Bart Simpson throws a marker pen, it rotates in slow motion and a match cut replaces it with a cylindrical satellite as a parody of a similar transition used in the film; both film and cartoon use Richard Strauss' tone poem \"Also sprach Zarathustra\" as backing music.\n\n\"Deep Space Homer\" deals with Barney's alcoholism as he sobers up to become fit and clear-thinking, then regresses to his usual drunken persona after he has a non-alcoholic drink, an example of \"exaggerated incompetence.\" The episode also explores the relationships between members of the Simpson family, particularly how they evolve after Homer's voyage to space. At the start of the episode, Bart writes \"Insert Brain Here\" on the back of Homer's head to imply he is not intelligent enough to earn his family's respect. After Homer returns from space, Bart instead writes \"Hero\" on the back of his head. His trip to space and his heroic act gains him increased respect from his family, something Homer had struggled with for several years.\n\nNASA's main motivation for sending Homer to space is its low ratings. This is evident when Homer and Bart, who are seen as average Joes, are attempting to quickly change the channel when a space launch is shown. By 1994, NASA could no longer present space exploration as part of the Space Race—the tension between the Soviet Union and the United States had by then dissipated. In the episode, NASA attempts to use social class as a means of increasing ratings by sending an \"average schmo\" such as Homer or Barney to space. Homer's space journey increased ratings for NASA; according to the professor of English Paul Cantor, this illustrates how easily trends in ratings can be affected by societal change.\n\n\"Deep Space Homer\" aired at 8:00 p.m. EST on February 24, 1994. It finished 32nd in ratings for the week of February 21–27, 1994, with a Nielsen rating of 11.1, the equivalent of approximately 10.3 million viewing households. Even though it was the highest-rated show on Fox that week, \"Deep Space Homer\" did not perform as well as the previous week's episode \"Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy\", which had a Nielsen rating of 11.6, equivalent to 11 million viewing households.\n\n\"Deep Space Homer\" is a part of the DVD release and Blu-ray of the show's fifth season, which includes commentary by \"Simpsons\" staff Groening, Silverman, James L. Brooks, Mirkin, Conan O'Brien, and Jim Reardon. The episode is also included in the \"Simpsons: Risky Business\" box set, and is available to stream at the \"Simpsons World\" site run by FXX. The \"Simpsons\" game \"Tapped Out\" held an event based on the episode; it allowed players to train Springfield citizens for a space mission.\n\nIn 1994, film magazine \"Empire\" declared \"Deep Space Homer\" a \"contender for the greatest episode ever\", listing it as the third-best \"Simpsons\" parody of a film. In 1998, \"TV Guide\" listed it in its list of top twelve \"Simpsons\" episodes. In his 2004 book \"Planet Simpson\", Chris Turner cited the episode as one of his five favorites. He described the sequence with Homer eating potato chips in the Space Shuttle and the speech by newscaster Kent Brockman, who believes alien ants have taken over the shuttle, as \"simply among the finest comedic moments in the history of television\".\n\nIn 2011, \"The Daily Telegraph\" named the episode among their ten favorites for its cameos and jokes. In 2017, MSNBC named \"Deep Space Homer\" its fourth-favorite \"Simpsons\" episode, describing Homer's realization that \"Planet of the Apes\" is set on Earth as \"pure genius\". Aldrin and Taylor received praise for their performances; \"IGN\" and \"Phoenix.com\" ranked Taylor's guest appearance among the show's greatest. In 2019, \"Time\" ranked the episode sixth in its list of 10 best \"Simpsons\" episodes picked by \"Simpsons\" experts.\n\nThe episode is a favorite of Silverman, but contains one of Groening's least-favorite jokes: Homer's face morphs into those of Popeye and Richard Nixon while exposed to g-forces, which Groening felt made no sense in context. At the request of astronaut Edward Lu, a copy of the episode was placed on the International Space Station for astronauts to view.\n\nKent Brockman's line, \"I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords\", became an Internet meme. It is frequently used to show mock submission or suggest a powerful entity, such as robots, could become capable enough to conquer humanity. In 2007, \"New Scientist\" used the phrase when reporting the British government's research into aliens, and in 2011, Ken Jennings, a long-standing contestant of the game show \"Jeopardy!\", used it in reference to the computer Watson.\n\n"}

In the same year he founded a paramilitary organization in Tarnów together with his brother, in which they regularly organized military exercises and training. Later this organization also engaged in recruiting to the Polish National Army.\n\nIn the years 1914-1917, he served in the I Brigade of Piłsudski's Polish Legions and became commander of an infantry platoon. In the following years he was commanding officer of, among others, the 5th Infantry Regiment, the 40th Infantry Regiment stationed in Lwów, and the 12th Infantry Division based in Tarnopol. In 1928, Władysław Langner was called to Warsaw, where he worked as Head of the Main Administration Bureau of the Ministry of War. After three years he was promoted to the second Vice Minister of War and Chief of Army Administration, and in 1934 he was promoted to General. Until 1938 he served as a CO of Łódź-based IV Corps Command. Later, until 1939, he served on the same post in the headquarters of the VI Corps Command in Lwów.\n\nDuring the Polish Defensive War of September 1939, Władysław Langner assumed command of all the Polish forces stationed in and around the city of Lwów. Although most of the regular Polish forces normally stationed in the area were transported to the front, he managed to organize the defence of both the city and its area. With march battalions, rear troops, marauders and raw recruits, he prepared the city for the fight. He commanded his forces during fights against the Wehrmacht and the Red Army, which later became known as the Battle of Lwów. Although his troops were badly outnumbered, outflanked and under equipped, the defense lasted ten days, after which General Langner surrendered the city to the Red Army so as to, according to his own words, \"not endanger further the lives of the people and risk the destruction of the city\".\n\nAfter leaving the city, he managed to escape to Romania, and then to France, where he joined the reborn Polish Army being formed under the auspices of the Polish government in exile. After the fall of France, he retreated to the United Kingdom. There, he was appointed commander of the Polish 3rd Carpathian Rifle Brigade stationed in Scotland. In 1941 he gave up this post and between 1943 and the end of World War II he served as an Inspector of Military Training of Polish Units in Great Britain.\n\nIn 1945 Władysław Langner retired to a farm near Newcastle upon Tyne, where he died in 1972.\n\n"}

{"id": "2049869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049869", "title": "Ground tissue", "text": "Ground tissue\n\nThe ground tissue of plants includes all tissues that are neither dermal nor vascular. It can be divided into three types based on the nature of the cell walls.\n\n\nParenchyma (; from Greek παρέγχυμα \"parenkhyma\", \"visceral flesh\" from παρεγχεῖν \"parenkhein\", \"to pour in\" from παρα- \"para-\", \"beside\", ἐν \"en-\", \"in\" and χεῖν \"khein\", \"to pour\") is a versatile ground tissue that generally constitutes the \"filler\" tissue in soft parts of plants. It forms, among other things, the cortex (outer region) and pith (central region) of stems, the cortex of roots, the mesophyll of leaves, the pulp of fruits, and the endosperm of seeds. Parenchyma cells are living cells and may remain meristematic at maturity—meaning that they are capable of cell division if stimulated. They have thin and flexible cellulose cell walls, and are generally polyhedral when close-packed, but can be roughly spherical when isolated from their neighbours. Parenchyma cells are generally large. They have large central vacuoles, which allow the cells to store and regulate ions, waste products, and water. Tissue specialised for food storage is commonly formed of parenchyma cells.\n\nParenchyma cells have a variety of functions:\n\nThe shape of parenchyma cells varies with their function. In the spongy mesophyll of a leaf, parenchyma cells range from near-spherical and loosely arranged with large intercellular spaces, to branched or stellate, mutually interconnected with their neighbours at the ends of their arms to form a three-dimensional network, like in the red kidney bean \"Phaseolus vulgaris\" and other mesophytes. These cells, along with the epidermal guard cells of the stoma, form a system of air spaces and chambers that regulate the exchange of gases. In some works, the cells of the leaf epidermis are regarded as specialised parenchymal cells, but the modern preference has long been to classify the epidermis as plant dermal tissue, and parenchyma as ground tissue.\n\nShapes of parenchyma:\n\nCollenchyma tissue is composed of elongated cells with irregularly thickened walls. They provide structural support, particularly in growing shoots and leaves. Collenchyma tissue makes up things such as the resilient strands in stalks of celery. Collenchyma cells are usually living, and have only a thick primary cell wall made up of cellulose and pectin. Cell wall thickness is strongly affected by mechanical stress upon the plant. The walls of collenchyma in shaken plants (to mimic the effects of wind etc.), may be 40–100% thicker than those not shaken.\n\nThere are four main types of collenchyma:\n\nCollenchyma cells are most often found adjacent to outer growing tissues such as the vascular cambium and are known for increasing structural support and integrity.\n\nThe first use of \"collenchyma\" () was by Link (1837) who used it to describe the sticky substance on \"Bletia\" (Orchidaceae) pollen. Complaining about Link's excessive nomenclature, Schleiden (1839) stated mockingly that the term \"collenchyma\" could have more easily been used to describe elongated sub-epidermal cells with unevenly thickened cell walls.\n\nSclerenchyma is the tissue which makes the plant hard and stiff. Sclerenchyma is the supporting tissue in plants. Two types of sclerenchyma cells exist: fibers and sclereids. Their cell walls consist of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Sclerenchyma cells are the principal supporting cells in plant tissues that have ceased elongation. Sclerenchyma fibers are of great economic importance, since they constitute the source material for many fabrics (e.g. [flax] hemp, jute, and ramie).\n\nUnlike the collenchyma, mature sclerenchyma is composed of dead cells with extremely thick cell walls (secondary walls) that make up to 90% of the whole cell volume. The term \"sclerenchyma\" is derived from the Greek σκληρός (\"sklērós\"), meaning \"hard.\" It is the hard, thick walls that make sclerenchyma cells important strengthening and supporting elements in plant parts that have ceased elongation. The difference between fibers and sclereids is not always clear: transitions do exist, sometimes even within the same plant.\n\nFibers or bast are generally long, slender, so-called prosenchymatous cells, usually occurring in strands or bundles. Such bundles or the totality of a stem's bundles are colloquially called fibers. Their high load-bearing capacity and the ease with which they can be processed has since antiquity made them the source material for a number of things, like ropes, fabrics and mattresses. The fibers of flax (\"Linum usitatissimum\") have been known in Europe and Egypt for more than 3,000 years, those of hemp (\"Cannabis sativa\") in China for just as long. These fibers, and those of jute (\"Corchorus capsularis\") and ramie (\"Boehmeria nivea\", a nettle), are extremely soft and elastic and are especially well suited for the processing to textiles. Their principal cell wall material is cellulose.\n\nContrasting are hard fibers that are mostly found in monocots. Typical examples are the fiber of many grasses, \"Agave sisalana\" (sisal), \"Yucca\" or \"Phormium tenax\", \"Musa textilis\" and others. Their cell walls contain, besides cellulose, a high proportion of lignin. The load-bearing capacity of \"Phormium tenax\" is as high as 20–25 kg/mm², the same as that of good steel wire (25 kg/ mm²), but the fibre tears as soon as too great a strain is placed upon it, while the wire distorts and does not tear before a strain of 80 kg/mm². The thickening of a cell wall has been studied in \"Linum\". Starting at the centre of the fiber, the thickening layers of the secondary wall are deposited one after the other. Growth at both tips of the cell leads to simultaneous elongation. During development the layers of secondary material seem like tubes, of which the outer one is always longer and older than the next. After completion of growth, the missing parts are supplemented, so that the wall is evenly thickened up to the tips of the fibers.\n\nFibers usually originate from meristematic tissues. Cambium and procambium are their main centers of production. They are usually associated with the xylem and phloem of the vascular bundles. The fibers of the xylem are always lignified, while those of the phloem are cellulosic. Reliable evidence for the fibre cells' evolutionary origin from tracheids exists. During evolution the strength of the tracheid cell walls was enhanced, the ability to conduct water was lost and the size of the pits was reduced. Fibers that do not belong to the xylem are bast (outside the ring of cambium) and such fibers that are arranged in characteristic patterns at different sites of the shoot.\nThe term \"sclerenchyma\" (originally \"Sclerenchyma\") was introduced by Mettenius in 1865.\n\nSclereids are the reduced form of sclerenchyma cells with highly thickened, lignified walls.\n\nThey are small bundles of sclerenchyma tissue in plants that form durable layers, such as the cores of apples and the gritty texture of pears (\"Pyrus communis\"). Sclereids are variable in shape. The cells can be isodiametric, prosenchymatic, forked or elaborately branched. They can be grouped into bundles, can form complete tubes located at the periphery or can occur as single cells or small groups of cells within parenchyma tissues. But compared with most fibres, sclereids are relatively short. Characteristic examples are brachysclereids or the stone cells (called stone cells because of their hardness) of pears and quinces (\"Cydonia oblonga\") and those of the shoot of the wax plant (\"Hoya carnosa\"). The cell walls fill nearly all the cell's volume. A layering of the walls and the existence of branched pits is clearly visible. Branched pits such as these are called ramiform pits. The shell of many seeds like those of nuts as well as the stones of drupes like cherries and plums are made up from sclereids.\n\nThese structures are used to protect other cells.\n\n"}

King Jammy then began working with top artists in Jamaica throughout the 1980s and 1990s such as Admiral Bailey, Admiral Tibet, Chaka Demus, Frankie Paul, Lieutenant Stitchie, Pinchers, and even Dennis Brown. Jammy's productions and sound system dominated reggae music for the remainder of the 1980s and into the 1990s. He continues to work as a producer, working with some of today's top Jamaican artists, including Sizzla.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2049887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049887", "title": "Territorial designation", "text": "Territorial designation\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a territorial designation follows modern peerage titles, linking them to a specific place or places. It is also an integral part of all baronetcies. Within Scotland, a territorial designation proclaims a relationship with a particular area of land.\n\nA territorial designation is an aspect of the creation of modern peerages that links them to a specific place or places, at least one of which is almost always in the United Kingdom. It is given in the patent of creation after the actual peerage title itself, of which it is not a part. It is also an integral part of all baronetcies.\n\nFor instance, the life peerages conferred on the former Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and James Callaghan were created as \"Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire\" and \"Baron Callaghan of Cardiff, of the City of Cardiff in the County of South Glamorgan\". The part of the peerage before the comma is the actual title, and the part after the comma is the territorial designation. These peers should be referred to as \"The Baroness Thatcher\" and \"The Lord Callaghan of Cardiff\": it is incorrect both to use part of the territorial designation as part of the title and to leave out part of the actual title; thus \"The Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven\" and \"The Lord Callaghan\" are incorrect, although the latter may be used informally.\n\nSome territorial designations name more than one place, and the format used depends on whether such places are in the same county or other administrative division. For instance, the life peerages conferred on Margaret McDonagh and John Morris were created as \"Baroness McDonagh, of Mitcham and of Morden in the London Borough of Merton\" and \"Baron Morris of Aberavon, of Aberavon in the County of West Glamorgan and of Ceredigion in the County of Dyfed\". Occasionally, a place outside the United Kingdom can be named: for instance, the life peerage conferred on Howard Florey was created as \"Baron Florey, of Adelaide in the Commonwealth of Australia and of Marston in the County of Oxford\", or the life peerage conferred on Sue Ryder was created as \"Baroness Ryder of Warsaw, of Warsaw in Poland and of Cavendish in the County of Suffolk\".\n\nWith the exception of Royal peerages, which are often created without them, territorial designations are used with the creation of almost all baronies and viscountcies. Higher ranks of the peerage often used to have them as well, but now rarely do. With the higher ranks, the format could be the same as with lower ranks or it could simply specify the location of the place named in the actual title. For example: \"Duke of Wellington, in the County of Somerset\" (1814) and \"Duke of Gordon, of Gordon Castle in Scotland\" (1876) but \"Duke of Fife\" (1899); \"Marquess of Cholmondeley, in the County Palatine of Chester\" (1815) and \"Marquess of Ailsa, of the Isle of Ailsa in the County of Ayr\" (1831) but \"Marquess of Zetland\" (1892); \"Earl of Craven, in the County of York\" (1801) and \"Earl Nelson, of Trafalgar and of Merton in the County of Surrey\" (1805) but \"Earl of Stockton\" (1984).\n\nIn the 19th century, it was possible to create a different peerage title merely by altering the location of the comma. Thus the title \"Baron Stanley of Alderley, in the County of Chester\" differs in format from \"Baron Stanley, of Bickerstaffe in the County Palatine of Lancaster\" only by the placement of the comma: the former title is \"Baron Stanley of Alderley\" whilst the latter is \"Baron Stanley\". This format is no longer used: if a peerage title in the format \"Baron X of Y\" is wanted, the full territorial designation must be used. Thus if the Barony of Stanley of Alderley were created today, it would have to be \"Baron Stanley of Alderley, of Alderley in the County of Chester\". This dual usage of the same term in the title and in the territorial designation may appear peculiar, but it does occasionally occur; an example would be Adair Turner, who was created \"Baron Turner of Ecchinswell, of Ecchinswell in the County of Hampshire\".\n\nIn the case of a victory title, at least one term usually refers to the site of the grantee's triumph, usually outside the UK. For example, the famous admiral Horatio Nelson was created \"Viscount Nelson, of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk\", the Nile being the site of his victory against the French in the Battle of the Nile, and Burnham Thorpe being his place of birth.\n\nRecognition of a Territorial Designation may also be granted in Scotland by the Lord Lyon to Scottish armigers who own (or were born in or were associated with) named land, generally outwith a town (i.e. rural). The Lord Lyon advises that for a territorial designation to be recognised, there must be 'ownership of a substantial area of land to which a well-attested name attaches, that is to say, ownership of an “estate”, or farm or, at the very least, a house with policies extending to five acres or thereby'. The Territorial Designation in this case is considered to be an indivisible part of the name, though not necessarily an indicator of ancestral or feudal nobility, though recognition of a territorial designation is usually accorded alongside the grant or matriculation of a Coat of Arms, which confers minor nobility status. A person bearing a Scottish territorial designation is either a Baron, Chief or Chieftain or a Laird, the latter denoting 'landowner', or is a descendant of one of the same. The Lord Lyon is the ultimate arbiter as to determining entitlement to a territorial designation, and his right of discretion in recognising these, and their status as a name, dignity or title, has been confirmed in the Scottish courts.\n\nAccording to Debrett's and other references, a \"John Smith of Abercrombie\" is addressed as simply \"Abercrombie\". If he is a clan chief, he may be addressed by either the place-name or the surname of his clan.\n\n"}

In 2013, Tanaka's contract was terminated for several violations, leaving KAT-TUN as a four-man ensemble, and Tatsuya Ueda took the T to keep the acronym. By the end of March 2016, Taguchi left both the group and the agency, leaving KAT-TUN with only three remaining members.\n\nBefore becoming KAT-TUN, each member belonged to different trainee units within Johnny & Associates.

The eight members were switched around before it officially became KAT-TUN, with the current three members plus Jin Akanishi, Koki Tanaka and Junnosuke Taguchi. Although the formation was only meant to be a temporary support unit, KAT-TUN gained a great deal of attention and became a solid unit.\n\nIn 2002, in response to many requests, KAT-TUN held their first concert called , for which 550,000 people tried to get tickets. That same year, they performed eleven shows in a single day. This is the current record in Japan for the most performances in one day. Since then, KAT-TUN has held concerts in Japan almost every season.\n\nIn 2003-2004, their popularity rose to that of a debuted group, to the point where they performed on Music Station multiple times before debuting.

Within the first week, \"Best of KAT-TUN\", \"Real Face\" and \"Real Face Film\" topped all three \"Oricon\" weekly charts by selling 556,548 copies, 754,234 copies and 374,202 copies respectively. They became the second artists to do so, the first being Ayumi Hamasaki. With these numbers, KAT-TUN holds the record for the highest weekly single debut sales (previously held by Arashi with their debut single \"Arashi\" of 557,000 copies sold in 1999). In addition, \"Real Face\" topped the \"Oricon\" charts for three weeks straight, becoming the first debut single to do so in Japan in 8 years 8 months since KinKi Kids' debut single \"Garasu no Shōnen.\" The single sold over a million copies in nine weeks, making \"Real Face\" the highest selling single for the year 2006.\n\nIn March 2006, KAT-TUN became the first group to hold their own performances in Japan's most popular stadium, Tokyo Dome, before debuting. They performed to 110,000 people over two days and about 630,000 people in total during the tour. About three months after releasing \"Real Face\", KAT-TUN released their second single, \"Signal\", on July 19.\n\nOn October 12, member Akanishi announced a hiatus from the group in order to study linguistics abroad in the United States, leaving KAT-TUN as a five-member group for six months. The remaining members continued activities by releasing their third single, \"Bokura no Machi de\" as the theme song to members Kamenashi and Tanaka's drama, \"Tatta Hitotsu no Koi\" and their second album, \"Cartoon KAT-TUN II You\" on December 7.\n\nKAT-TUN is the first group in Japan to have all three singles from debut to exceed 500,000 in yearly sales, taking first, fifth and thirteenth place on the Oricon yearly singles chart.\n\nUnder the same name as their second album, KAT-TUN started their second nationwide tour, \"Tour 2007 Cartoon KAT-TUN II You\", still without Akanishi, on April 3.

On May 15, during the MC segment promoting \"Don't U Ever Stop\" on Music Station, Kamenashi announced that two shows had been added to their Tokyo Dome tour dates, resulting in a total of four consecutive days at the Dome. This marked a historic event in the Dome's history, as KAT-TUN became the first Japanese artist to hold four consecutive days at the stadium since it opened in 1988. Other Japanese artists, such as SMAP, X Japan and Ayumi Hamasaki have had three consecutive days at the Dome.

Due to the political unrest in Thailand, Johnny & Associates announced on May 15 that KAT-TUN's concert in Bangkok would be indefinitely postponed.\n\nKAT-TUN released their first 2010 album, \"No More Pain\", on June 16 in two versions: a limited and regular edition that both include solo songs by each member.

On June 29 Music Station reported that KAT-TUN ranked as No.10 best-selling Heisei era's idol with the total sales of 6,661,293 copies from 17 singles.

Their stint as the show's main hosts started from April 2014 until March 2016. Another Johnny's group NEWS then replaced them as the hosts of the show.\n\nThe group has had three different radio shows, each hosted by different members and all have aired for several years.\n\nFormer members Jin Akanishi, Koki Tanaka and Junnosuke Taguchi hosted \"KAT-TUN Style\" together from April 2006 until March 2012.

He has a new radio show called \"Kamenashi Kazuya - Hang Out\" and currently airs every Saturday from 10:20am – 10:50am.\n\nTaguchi Junnosuke also had his own radio show called \"Tag-tune driving\" and a radio show together with Yuichi Nakamaru called \"KAT-TUN no Gatsūn\" from April 2012 and ended in March 2016.\n\nAs a group, KAT-TUN has appeared in Koichi Domoto's \"Shock\" musical, \"Summary of Johnnys World\" with NEWS and Ya-ya-yah and Johnny's long-running \"Dream Boys\" musicals from 2004 to 2006.\n\nSince 2004, member Kazuya Kamenashi has played the lead role in \"Dream Boys\" musicals consecutively each year, after senior Hideaki Takizawa handed down the role to Kamenashi.\nKamenashi and fellow KAT-TUN member Koki Tanaka paired up to play the lead roles for the shows held in 2007 and 2008. The pair collaborated once again as the leads for the 2011 shows alongside fellow KAT-TUN member Yuichi Nakamaru. The 2012 shows for the musical began in September, and once again Kamenashi reprised his role as the lead for the musical.\n\nSince their first concert in 2002, granted after overwhelming numbers of fan requests to Johnny's, KAT-TUN regularly holds concerts during almost every season of the year in Japan. This has helped them gain more popularity with their fans. It was considered remarkable for a Johnny's group which had not yet officially debuted to be able to hold its own concerts.\n\nKAT-TUN was the first Japanese artist to perform for four days in a row at Tokyo Dome during their \"Queen of Pirates\" tour. The following year, they broke their own record becoming the first artists ever to perform for eight consecutive days at Tokyo Dome during their \"Break The Records: By You & For You 2009\" tour. Now, Johnny & Associates submitted this new record to Guinness Book of World Records for KAT-TUN to be recognized as the Japanese boy band who broke the records in Tokyo Dome performances.\n\nThe group (excluding Jin Akanishi) held their biggest ever concert tour in 2010 titled \"KAT-TUN -NO MORE PAIИ- WORLD TOUR 2010\" which consisted of concerts in many major cities across Japan. The tour also included concerts held in Taiwan and Korea; the first time the group has ever toured outside Japan for their official concerts. \nAlthough during their pre-debut years, KAT-TUN had on several occasions toured overseas with their senior groups, while they were still Johnny Jrs.\n\nTheir nationwide tour for 2012 titled \"KAT-TUN LIVE TOUR 2012 CHAIN\" began in Nagiita on Feb 11, they toured 12 cities across Japan including Sendai; which was one of the worst affected areas by the Tohoku earthquake & tsunami disaster back in March 2011.\n\nKAT-TUN regularly appeared in TV commercials to endorse for NTT docomo, SKY PerfecTV!, Rohto and Lotte from 2005 to 2009.\n\nSince 2010, member Kazuya Kamenashi endorses Panasonic's Lamdash shaver and DOLTZ electric toothbrush, and AOKI 3D slim suits. Kamenashi also endorses KIRIN's 'Gogo no Kocha' tea since March 2012, and is endorsing SOURS Gummies since early 2013.\n\nSince early 2011, the group together has endorsed Suzuki's 'SOLIO' car, and has sung commercial theme songs for Sofina and Wing products. The group are also currently endorsing the mobile game site entag!.\n\nOn August 26–27, 2006 KAT-TUN members were the main personality supporters for the NTV telethon \"24 Hour Television: Love Saves the Earth\" charity program.\n\n"}

He attended Perth Boys Central School and grew up in Claremont.\n\nAt 15, he began writing for a local newspaper, but soon became dissatisfied by the isolation he felt. \"Living in Australia made me crazy\", he later said in an interview. \"It took a month for a book to get to Australia, a year for a play and forever for an idea.\"\n\nHe was working for \"The West Australian\" as a journalist but resigned his job in April 1930 to travel to the US. Travelling with a friend, E Irwin, he went via Sydney and Auckland, then Fiji – where they were arrested for stowing away on a ship – before arriving in Canada. They eventually arrived in the US and went to Los Angeles. and Mexico, writing for the \"Sporting Globe\". Eventually they made their way to London in July 1931.\n\nGoff was private secretary to novelist Louis Goulding.\n\nGoff and Irwin later published a book of their travels called \"No Longer Innocent\" in late 1933. This was well received.\n\nHe worked in several jobs, including as a bookie, while trying to break into journalism. He eventually found work with the \"Daily Mirror\", which in the mid-1930s sent Goff to Los Angeles as the paper's Hollywood correspondent.\n\nGoff worked as a journalist in Hollywood. In January 1937 he signed a writing contract with Warner Bros. He was linked romantically with fellow Australian expatriate, actor Constance Worth. He adapted the book \"The Story of San Michele\" although it was not made. In 1938 he was reported as working on a version of \"Svengali\".\n\nHe eventually became a staff writer at Republic Studios. His work included uncredited contributions to several of the westerns in \"The Three Mesquiteers\" series, and a Gene Autry vehicle, \"Sunset in Wyoming\" (1941).\n\nHe then joined the staff at Warner Bros. He was working on a picture called \"Stuff of Heroes\" for Jane Bryan. He wrote a film for Columbia, \"The Out for Movies\".\n\nHe was one of several writers on an A-picture, \"My Love Came Back\" (1940) and did some uncredited work on \"The Great Mr. Nobody\" (1941). He was an early writer on \"The Horn Blows at Midnight\". He also wrote a never-filmed script about an American soldier in Australia, \"Private Eddie Lawson\".\n\nHe was romantically linked with Kay Francis.\n\nDuring the war Goff joined the Army Signal Corps where he found himself making wartime propaganda shorts at the former Astoria Studios in Long Island, New York.\n\nAt the Astoria Studios, Goff met Ben Roberts, a fellow writer who had also worked at Republic. One day over lunch Roberts told Goff of an idea he had for a short story that lacked an ending. Goff came up with an ending and suggested that they turn it into a play instead of a short story. Working at night over a period of 13 months, they completed the play, which was called \"Portrait in Black\" and had runs in London and Broadway. It also sold to the movies for $100,000.\n\nGoff was also credited on a comedy for PRC, \"The Captain from Köpenick\" (1945). It would be the last film he wrote without Roberts for the rest of his career.\n\nAt the end of the war, Roberts and Goff decided to remain as a team, and wrote \"Prejudice\" (1949), a short film about anti-Semitism produced by the Protestant Film Commission.\n\nThey also wrote a screenplay based on a Ben Hecht story, \"The Shadow\", which was never filmed, but which attracted the interest of Warner Bros. who hired them to rewrite a murder mystery, \"Backfire\" (made in 1948, released in 1950). Their work on that film impressed the studio enough to sign them to a five-year contract.\n\nAlthough Goff and Roberts considered themselves primarily comedy writers, Warners saw them as action men and assigned them to rewrite another script, a gangster story called \"White Heat\" (1949). White Heat was based on a story submitted to the studio by Virginia Kellogg, which had been inspired by a real-life robbery. Goff and Roberts turned Kellogg's story inside out, making it a semi 'Greek tragedy' about a gangster with a mother complex. James Cagney agreed to star, Raoul Walsh directed and the resulting film became an instant classic. Kellogg was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Story, but, under Academy rules of the time, Goff and Roberts were not.\n\nWarners put the team on to an early draft of \"Mara Maru\" for which they were not credited. They worked on \"Captain Horatio Hornblower\" (1951), with Gregory Peck in the title role, then were reunited with Cagney on \"Come Fill the Cup\" (1951). They wrote a Joan Crawford vehicle, \"Goodbye, My Fancy\" (1952), provided the original story for a British film, \"Gift Horse\" (1952) and were among several writers on the anthology film \"O. Henry's Full House\" (1952), for 20th Century Fox.\n\nGoff and Roberts stayed with Fox for two adventure films, \"White Witch Doctor\" (1953) and \"King of the Khyber Rifles\" (1954).\n\nFrom 1954–55, Goff served as president of the screenwriters council of the Screen Writers Guild.\n\nAt MGM they wrote another adventure tale, \"Green Fire\" (1954) then returned to Warners to do a musical melodrama with Mario Lanza, \"Serenade\" (1956), from a novel by James M. Cain. At Warners they did a Civil War era saga for Raoul Walsh, \"Band of Angels\" (1957), then made a third film with Cagney, \"Man of a Thousand Faces\" (1957), a biopic of Lon Chaney which earned Goff and Roberts an Oscar nomination..\n\nThey wrote a pilot for a TV series that was never made, \"The Fat Man\" (1959). Cagney used them again for an IRA thriller, \"Shake Hands with the Devil\" (1959) and they wrote an episode of \"Bourbon Street Beat \" (1960).\n\n1960 finally saw the release of a film version of \"Portrait in Black\". It was produced by Ross Hunter who used Goff and Roberts on a similar thriller, \"Midnight Lace\" (1960). They wrote a third film for Hunter, a remake of \"Next Time We Love\", for Doris Day and Rock Hudson, but it was not made.\n\nThey did the never-made \"The Sea Wolves\" about John P. Cromwell in World War II.\n\nDuring the 1960s Goff and Roberts turned increasingly to television. They wrote a pilot for a show starring Rod Taylor, \"Dateline: San Francisco\" (1962) which was not picked up.\n\nThey created and wrote \"The Rogues\" (1964). \n\nThey wrote the pilot for a series, \"Preview Tonight\" (1968) which was not picked up, and wrote a thriller in South Africa, \"The Second Sin\" (1966). \n\n\"Three for Danger\" (1967) was another unsold pilot but they wrote an episode of \"Ironside\" and \"The Danny Thomas Hour\", and enjoyed great success as writers and producers for \"Mannix\" (1968–75) from its second season onwards, overseeing significant changes on the show. A profile of Goff and Roberts from 1968 said that \"the rapport between the producers is quite apparent. One complements the other. One will back off if the other makes a point more succinctly. Goff, perhaps a touch more serious in manner, speaks with an Aussie accent. Roberts is a quick talker and has a laugh slightly reminiscent of Ed Wynn's.\"\n\nA TV series they created \"My Friend Tony\" (1969) was less successful although it ran a season.\n\nThey wrote some thrillers, \"\" (1975) and \"The Killer Who Wouldn't Die\" (1976) (starring Mike Connors from \"Mannix\") and had an enormous success creating and writing the pilot for \"Charlie's Angels\" (1976–81). Goff and Roberts left the series after that (Goff said \"they (the producers) wanted us to write in a lot of car chases and to put guns in the hands of the girls; we walked,\") but were entitled to 12.5% of the show's profits and were part of a lawsuit against Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg to have a correct accounting done.\n\nGoff and Roberts were main writers on the TV series of \"Logan's Run\" (1976). They also created the short-lived \"Time Express\" (1979) and produced \"Nero Wolfe\" (1981). They were one of many writers on \"The Legend of the Lone Ranger\" (1981).\n\nRoberts died in 1984.\n\nHe died of Alzheimer's disease in 1999.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2049932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049932", "title": "Mahogany Ship", "text": "Mahogany Ship\n\nThe Mahogany Ship refers to a putative early Australian shipwreck that is believed by some to lie beneath the sand in the Armstrong Bay area, approximately 3 to 6 kilometres west of Warrnambool in southwest Victoria, Australia. In many modern accounts it is described as a Spanish or Portuguese caravel after the wreck was associated with the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia by Kenneth McIntyre in his 1977 book \"The Secret Discovery of Australia.\" The most recent research has questioned this theory and provided other explanations.\n\nThree Mahogany Ship Symposia have been conducted in nearby Warrnambool: in 1981, 1987 and 2005, attracting significant public and academic interest and the contributions of Manning Clark, Barry Jones, Kenneth McIntyre, Lawrence Fitzgerald, Ian McKiggan, Bill Richardson, Edmund Gill, Jack Loney and many others.\n\nWhile there is no conclusive evidence such a wreck exists today, nineteenth-century accounts of the relic persist both in popular folklore and in publications of varying academic rigour. In the 1980s and 1990s, writers Jack Loney and Ian McKiggan documented the accounts of a number of purported nineteenth century eyewitnesses to the wreck. While these were of varying degrees of detail, they indicate a strong local tradition about the wreck in the area. Commenting on the surge of interest in the wreck that appeared at the end of the nineteenth century, Loney observed that research on the wreck was often based around \"loosely written words, sometimes presented from hearsay, sometimes from people who could barely read or write, and in most cases from some recalling memories forty or fifty years old.\" McKiggan took a more liberal view, sharing the opinion of well-known local historian Jack Powling, who wrote \"When people knew it, and could see it, they called it 'The Old Wreck;' it was only after it disappeared... that it was given the romantic and slightly misleading name of 'The Mahogany Ship.' Much has been written about it, and much of what has been written has been frankly a good deal of nonsense... Legend by now it may be, but the Old Wreck is no myth...\" In 2005, Murray Johns also documented the nineteenth century eyewitnesses to the wreck, but found they fell into three distinct groups – those who placed the wreck in the sea, a second group who said it was on the beach, a third group who identified it as high up in the sand dunes. This has led Johns to conclude the accounts were describing three separate wrecks.\n\nThe earliest documented account of a wreck in the area was carried by a Portland newspaper article of 1847 which described \"a wreck, about two miles on the Belfast side of Warrnambool…of…a three hundred ton vessel …thrown completely into the [sand] hummocks\". The article went on to connect the wreck to the 1841 discovery of a number of articles of French manufacture found strewed along the beach. In 1981, writer Ian McKiggan also found further evidence of an 1841 French shipwreck in the area in the journal of Government Surveyor C.J. Tyers. Tyers wrote that the wreckage (including a keg containing a boat compass by maker Devot of Harve) indicated an unknown French whaler had been lost in the area.\n\nResearcher Jenny Williams Fawcett describes the \"1836 Hopkins River Incident\" as a foundation myth of the Mahogany Ship story. A popular version of this story was included in \"The Book of the Bush\" by George Dunderdale, in 1898, as follows:\n\nAccording to Jenny Fawcett, Dunderdale was merely repeating an account provided by David Fermaner, who also had not seen the wreck. As Fawcett notes, Captain Mills never wrote of a buried wreck himself, although he was central to various tellings of the story. Fawcett also dismisses the widely cited accounts of local whaler Hugh Donnelly, who claimed to have been a part of the 1836 incident. Fawcett's research indicates Donnelly did not actually arrive in the area until 1843.\n\nA letter to the editor of \"The Argus\" in April, 1890, quotes 'a sight-bearing' of the wreck taken by Captain Mills, and supplied to the writer by 'Mr. J.A. Lynar, of Queen-street, Melbourne'. It reads:\nAnother letter, from 1910, quoted a resident who rented a farm in the area in 1853 when the ship was said to be still readily visible and he could 'ride into its interior'. His location was:\nIn the opinion of Johns, Captain John Mason of Port Fairy was the first to describe the ship as being constructed of a dark timber which had the appearance of cedar or mahogany, in a letter to the \"Melbourne Argus\" on 1 April 1876. Mason clarified his account in \"The Australasian\" on 1 November 1890, expressing uncertainty about the provenance of the ship and stating that he did not think it was made of mahogany, however, by this time the title Mahogany Ship had already become the popular name for the wreck, thanks to the work of journalist John Stanley James (also known as \"The Vagabond\").\n\nJoseph Archibald, curator of the Warrnambool Museum, made strenuous efforts to document accounts and stimulate local interest in the wreck in the early 1890s. In June 1890, Archibald led the first organised search for the wreck. In July, former whaler Hugh Donnelly led another search, using bearings Captain John Mills was alleged to have given a friend. In November, the Victorian Government sponsored another search. In 1891, Archibald delivered a paper entitled \"Ancient Wreck at Warrnambool\", to the Royal Geographical Society, and this appears to mark the end of his active involvement. In 1910, having conducted further research, George Gordon McCrae also delivered a paper to the Geographical Society.\nFurther searches have been conducted since the 1980s, coinciding with the publication of Kenneth McIntyre's book and the Mahogany Ship symposia, conducted in nearby Warrnambool. These were conducted with the support of local authorities, businesses and volunteer organisations such as the National Trust. To date, however, nothing has been found to verify the popular Portuguese theory. Analysis of a number of artefacts alleged to be from the wreck were discussed by Rev. John Pinson in 1987. These include a ruler and two penholders, supposedly made from timber of the wreck. In both cases the wood has been identified as native to northern New South Wales or Queensland. A fragment of wood from the collection of Joseph Archibald, held by the National Library, Canberra has been identified as eucalyptus. An unusual amphora found on the beach in 1943 has been identified as of nineteenth century North African origin. In 2000, a two-metre length of European white oak was uncovered in the sand dunes. However, its shape and state indicated it was probably part of a shipment of white oak being carried on the sailing vessel \"Falls of Halladale\", which was wrecked at Peterborough in the early twentieth century.\n\nIn many of the accounts written in the late 19th century, the Mahogany Ship was described as Spanish. According to local writer and antiquarian Jack Loney, several theories supporting the Spanish connection were advanced. One theory was that the ship was the galleon \"Santa Ysabel\", which had sailed from Peru in 1595. A second theory was that the wreck was the ex-Spanish ship \"Santa Anna\". This is clearly incorrect as \"Santa Anna\" wrecked in 1811 in the Straits of Timor.\n\nToday, a popular theory suggests that the vessel is a missing ship of voyage of Portuguese exploration, wrecked in 1522. Kenneth McIntyre advanced this theory in 1977, as part of his theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia. According to McIntyre the Mahogany Ship was part of a secret expedition, under Cristóvão de Mendonça, that set out from the Spice Islands in 1522 to look for the Isles of Gold. McIntyre argued secrecy would have been essential because the mariners were entering waters deemed Spanish under the Treaty of Tordesillas. He suggested that, after discovering the north coast of Australia, they followed and chartered it and continued down the east coast and around Cape Howe, before one of the caravels was wrecked at Warrnambool. The other ships turned back and returned to the Spice Islands and then Portugal. Maps and documents of such a voyage were kept locked away in Portugal so as to avoid antagonising Spain and to keep the discoveries from her or other nations. McIntyre suggested that all of the original documents have since been lost or destroyed, except for references to Jave la Grande, which appear on the French Dieppe school of maps. Lawrence Fitzgerald also supported McIntyre's theory connecting the Mahogany ship to a Portuguese voyage in his 1984 book, \"Java La Grande\". However, Peter Trickett's 2007 book on the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia, \"Beyond Capricorn\", found fault with McIntyre's interpretation of the Mahogany ship as a caravel, and noted that until the wreck is found, \"all theories must remain to some degree speculative.\" Bob Nixon (2001) and Murray Johns (2005) have both criticised McIntyre's account for adding confusion to the story of the Mahogany ship through his identification of the wreck as a caravel and his selection and transcription of evidence.\n\nIn 2002 English writer Gavin Menzies speculated that the ship was a modified Chinese junk. He pointed to the reports that it was made of a 'dark wood' and was 'of an unconventional design'. He also cited claims that local Aborigines had a tradition that \"yellow men\" had at one time come from the wreck. The claims of Chinese origin have not been well received in academic circles. Many notable historians have dismissed the notion as fanciful at best.\n\nIn 2005, \"The Age\" newspaper reported Canberra mathematician Frank Coningham's claim that in the 1980s he had seen a document in a collection of British Parliamentary Papers showing British authorities \"dismantled the wreck to prevent an Australian land claim by the King of Portugal.\" However, Sydney archaeologist Denis Gojak has also investigated the claim and searched British Parliamentary papers. He has been unable to find such a document and doubts its existence as reported.\n\nMurray Johns' theory is that the Mahogany Ship was an incomplete vessel probably built by escaped Tasmanian convicts. He argues they may have arrived on the schooner \"Unity\" in 1813, which was wrecked or beached nearby. In his view, this theory explains the repeated nineteenth century references to several unidentified wrecks in different locations in the area. It also accounts for the finds of wood from northern New South Wales (where the \"Unity\" had been built), and the nineteenth century descriptions of the Mahogany Ship as crude construction.\n\nIn the novel \"Recollections of Geoffrey Hamlyn\" by Henry Kingsley, published in 1859, there is a fictional account of a wreck that resembled the Mahogany Ship. In the book the ship is described as being Dutch or Spanish. In some editions a footnote at the bottom of the page reads: \"Such a ship may be seen in the eastern end of Portland Bay, near the modern town of Port Fairy.\" To what extent the reference in this novel helped to promote the popular image of the wreck is uncertain. Murray Johns believes the footnote is a reference to the well documented wreck of the cedar built Schooner \"Sally Ann\" in Portland Bay. He also argues Thomas Clark's 1860 \"Mahogany Ship\" painting shows the \"Sally Ann\", the painting's title being adopted later.\n\n\"Wrack\", (1997), the first novel by Australian writer James Bradley, uses a wreck inspired by the Mahogany Ship as background to a murder mystery.\n\nIn 1992 the State Government of Victoria offered a reward of A$250,000 to anyone who could locate the wreck but the offer was withdrawn in 1993 without money having been paid.\n\nIn July 1999, shipwreck searcher Des Williams discovered wood fragments buried under the sand dunes in the area the ship was supposed to have been seen. These were found to be White Oak, which was a 'common shipbuilding timber' in the United States and Europe and, while from the Northern Hemisphere, could have been from the wreck of a different vessel.\n\nExtensive searches of the area were again conducted in late 1999 and in 2004, using heavy drills that penetrated to a depth of 10 metres.\n\nIn 2011, Rob Simpson used old accounts, especially of the 19th century search expedition by Alexander Rollo, to try to locate the vessel. He applied aerial archaeology techniques using Google Earth to identify what 'certainly seems to be a clear correlation between the coordinates and the outline vaguely visible' of a ship.\n\nToday, visitors frequently take to the Mahogany Ship Walking Track, which follows the coast between Warrnambool and Port Fairy and passes possible sites where the Mahogany Ship may rest. The area of greatest interest to contemporary researchers is Armstrong Bay east of Gorman's Road (formerly Lane) and west of Levy's Point near Dennington.\n\nA replica caravel inspired by the Mahogany Ship, named the \"Notorious\", was launched at Port Fairy in 2011.\n\n\n\n\n/ref>\n"}

But Yamaha also produced two race kits for the R7 the first for 914.25 US Dollars made when the other, unused bank of fuel injectors is activated and a pipe and ECU update. The second race kit for 12,190.00 US Dollars unleashed .\n\nThe R7 was built for racing 'out of the box', implied by the chassis, which was derived from information and geometry from the YZR500 machines of the period. The R7 was specified with Öhlins suspension components and with titanium valves, titanium conrods, a shortened Deltabox II frame and dry weight of just .\nThe intentions of the R7 were further underlined, with its designation of \"OW-02\" and the lack of any pillion/passenger provision. The ECU came pre-programmed with racing maps for fuel and ignition, which were unlocked when the ECU detected that the race kit's wiring harness had been installed.\n\n\"Super Streetbikes\" magazine ranked the R7 eighth in its list,\"The 10 Most Exotic Bikes Ever\", noting its extraordinary $32,000 price and \"top-spec Öhlins race suspension and running gear\" and that the bike, \"looked utterly amazing: genuine two-wheeled sex\", but said it was ironic that in spite of being the \"most exotic R-series bike ever\", it \"actually turned out to be a bit of a lemon\". The problem was that the bike as sold was hobbled, at only 100 hp, and that small teams could not afford the \"thousands of dollars\" of racing upgrades necessary to make the R7 competitive, and when they did, \"the crankshafts failed\". For the sake of simplicity and cost savings, Yamaha had chosen to detune the engines for bikes imported into all countries to meet the German market's maximum horsepower regulation, partially because whatever level it was detuned to was irrelevant, given that virtually every buyer intended to modify the bike from street-legal form in order to race.\n\nWhen the R7 was announced in 1999, only 50 were slated to be imported to the US, ten of which were earmarked for Yamaha's factory team. The waiting list for the remaining bikes far exceeded supply. The difficulty in obtaining one prompted \"Cycle World\"s Don Canet to caution eager buyers, \"Hey, whoah 'er down there, Mr. Trump. Having the cash is not always enough.\"\n\nIn 2001, motorcycling journalist Roland Brown had a high-side crash riding the YZF-R7 of World Superbike racer Noriyuki Haga during testing at Circuito de Jerez, Spain. \"Cycle World\", in a 2016 retrospective, had retired racer Freddie Spencer ride the R7 alongside five other famous racing bikes from the years 1986 through 2013. After riding earlier years' bikes and then moving to the R7, Spencer said, \"We've just moved into the modern age. This is the first bike that needs a steering damper.\" Compared to the other racing motorcycles, the R7 looked \"a bit pedestrian\", with its stripes and markings being only stickers instead of painted on, and having \"a subtlety to it that makes it blend into the crowd.\"\n"}

Recognized at a young age as an \"illui\", a genius, he was ordained as a rabbi at the age of seventeen by the famed Yisrael Meir Kagan, the \"Chofetz Chaim\".\n\nAs a child, he sought to leave Poland after he witnessed his father being shot by a policeman in 1919. He emigrated to the United States in 1929, studied with Harry Austryn Wolfson at Harvard and received his doctorate (concerned with the writings of Philo) at Brown University in 1935, one of the first awarded for Judaic studies in American academia. In 1940, an elaboration of his Ph.D. thesis was published with the title \"Philo and the Oral Law — The Philonic Interpretation of Biblical Law in Relation to the Palestinian Halakah.\" \n\nHe then joined the faculty of Yeshiva College, New York, where he taught Greek. He became a full professor in 1940 and was appointed dean of its Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) the same year. In 1943, Belkin was named became president of the college, Under his guidance, the institution expanded to become Yeshiva University in 1945. Belkin was a visionary who transformed Yeshiva from a small college and rabbinical seminary into a significant institution of considerable stature in Judaic Studies, natural and social sciences, and the humanities. Under his presidency, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine was opened as Yeshiva University's medical school.\n\nAs a scholar, he published many works on Jewish law and Hellenistic literature. His most significant published works are \"Philo and the Oral Law\" and \"In His Image: The Jewish Philosophy of Man as Expressed in Rabbinic Tradition\".\n\nIn his work, \"In His Image,\" Dr. Belkin described Judaism as a Democratic Theocracy — a theocracy because the first principle of Jewish thought describes the Kingship of God, and a democracy because the Written and the Oral Law emphasize the infinite worth of each human being.\n\nBelkin stepped down as university president in 1975.\n\nThe Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law gives an award to one graduating law student each year in Dr. Belkin's honor. The award recognizes the student who exemplifies the combination of excellence in leadership, scholarship and exceptional contribution to the growth and development of the law school. Past recipients of the Dr. Samuel Belkin Award include:\n\n\nBelkin died in 1976 in New York City after an illness. He was 64.\n\n\n"}

It was one of the first television shows to air on the channel. The eponymous sketch comedy trio that comprised the show's cast consisted of Dave (Gruber) Allen and brothers David Anthony Higgins and Steve Higgins.\n\n\"Higgins Boys\" was created and co-written by Joel Hodgson, the creator and original lead actor on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", another Comedy Channel program which was picked up at the same time. Like \"MST3K\", much of \"The Higgins Boys and Gruber\"'s comedy consisted of obscure pop culture references. The trio were presented as archetypal slackers who sat in a kitchen stage set, drank coffee, chain-smoked cigarettes, and talked between clips of various comedy shows, movies, and stand-up comedy acts. Aside from the standard format presented, the dialogue was largely improvised. The show was also distinctive for rerunning episodes of \"Bob and Ray\", \"Clutch Cargo\", and \"Supercar\" in their entirety, with interstitial commentary by the trio before and after commercial breaks.\n\nThe cast of \"The Kids in the Hall\" guest-starred in one episode. Joel Hodgson also appeared on the program with \"MST3K\" executive producer Jim Mallon.\n\nThe theme song of the show, entitled \"Fillet of Soul\", was written and recorded by The Young Fresh Fellows. The song originally appeared as the b-side of the band's rare 1986 \"Beer Money\" single, and has never appeared on compact disc.\n\n"}

As a poet, Melgar became one of the most prominent romantic poets of Peru in the 19th century history, best known for his famous poetic love songs known as \"yaravíes\". He is often considered like the Ecuadorian José Joaquín Olmedo and the Cuban José Martí, patriots of their respective countries.\n\nMariano Melgar was born in Arequipa on August 10, 1790, to Don Juan de Dios Melgar y Sanabria and Doña Andrea de Valdivieso, members of distinguished families of the time. He was baptized two days after birth at Arequipa's San Francisco cathedral. Growing up in Arequipa, he received his early education at the San Francisco convent and the Seminario de San Jerónimo. At a young age he demonstrated a gift for writing poetry and in his later years he was said to have fallen in love with María Santos Corrales, whom he romantically mentioned as \"Silvia\" in his poetry writings. The girl - born in 1797 - was seven years his junior and her parents opposed their relationship.\n\nAt the age of twenty his parents sent him to Lima to study law. The desire for independence in Lima was very strong and the country had promulgated a liberal constitution in 1812. Melgar became very well educated in the fields of history, geography, philosophy and mathematics. After briefly teaching what he had learned in Lima, he decided to return to Arequipa, only to find out that \"Silvia\" had been persuaded by her parents to be against a relationship with him. Melgar, in desperate sadness, left for Majes (west of Arequipa). Eventually, he established contacts with other independence revolutionaries of the time. In 1814, the revolution of Mateo Pumacahua took place in Cusco, which upset the apparent tranquillity of the Spanish viceroyalty of Peru and prompted Melgar to join the independence cause and march to combat. After winning the \"combat of Apacheta\" in Arequipa, the army marched towards Puno and fought on March 11, 1815 at the Battle of Umachiri, in which Melgar fought bravely directing the revolutionary army's artillery. The patriots were defeated and made prisoners, including the young Melgar. The Spanish General Ramirez, after holding Melgar captive, ordered his officers to place him before a firing squad. Melgar died in the morning of March 12, 1815, at the age of 24.\n\nIn a brief letter before his death, Melgar famously wrote to Spanish officials: \"Cover your eyes, since you're the ones who must be disabused because America will be free in less than ten years!\" Nine years later, on December 9, 1824, the Battle of Ayacucho, or \"La Quinua\", took place at Pampa de La Quinua, a few miles away from Ayacucho, near the town of Quinua. This battle – between the royalist (Spanish) and nationalist (republican) troops – sealed the independence of Peru and South America from Spain. On July 2, 1964, in recognition of his bravery in the first battles before independence, Peru officially recognized Mariano Melgar as one of the country's first patriots and soldiers for the revolution for independence. A memorial to Mariano Melgar can be found at the Apacheta cemetery in Arequipa, Peru.\n\nHe translated Ovid's and Virgi's poetry into Spanish.\n\n\n"}

He was Professor of Classical Archaeology and Art at the University of Oxford from 1925 to 1956.\n\nBeazley was born in Glasgow, Scotland on 13 September 1885, to Mark John Murray Beazley (died 1940) and Mary Catherine Beazley née Davidson (died 1918). He was educated at King Edward VI School, Southampton and Christ's Hospital, Sussex. He then attended Balliol College, Oxford where he read Literae Humaniores. He received firsts in both the Honour Moderations and the Final Honour School. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1907. While at Oxford he became a close friend of the poet James Elroy Flecker.\n\nAfter graduating, Beazley spent time at the British School at Athens. He then returned to University of Oxford as a student and tutor in Classics at Christ Church.\n\nDuring World War I, Beazley served in military intelligence. For most of the war he worked in Room 40 of the Admiralty's Naval Intelligence Division, where his colleagues included his fellow-archaeologist Winifred Lamb. He held the temporary rank of second lieutenant from March to October 1916 when he was on secondment to the army.\n\nIn 1925, he became Lincoln Professor of Classical Archaeology and Art at the University of Oxford, a position he held until 1956. He specialised in Greek decorated pottery (particularly black-figure and red-figure), and became a world authority on the subject. He adapted the art-historical method initiated by Giovanni Morelli to attribute the specific \"hands\" (style) of specific workshops and artists, even where no signed piece offered a name, e.g. the Berlin Painter, whose production he first distinguished. He looked at the sweep of classical pottery—major and minor pieces—to construct a history of workshops and artists in ancient Athens. The first English edition of his book, \"Attic Red-figure Vase-painters\", appeared in 1942 (in German as \"Attische Vasenmaler des rotfigurigen Stils\", 1925).\n\nBeazley retired in 1956, but continued to work until his death in Oxford, on 6 May 1970. His personal archive was purchased by the University of Oxford in 1964. It was originally accommodated in the Ashmolean Museum, but in 2007 it moved into the Ioannou Centre for Classical and Byzantine Studies as part of the new Classical Art Research Centre.\n\nBeazley was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1927. In 1954, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. \n\nBeazley was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1949, and therefore granted the title \"sir\". He was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 1959 New Year Honours \"for services to scholarship\".\n\nIn 1919, Beazley married the widow Marie Ezra (née Bloomfield), whose first husband had been killed in World War I. She died in 1967. His stepdaughter, from Marie's previous marriage, Giovanna Marie Therese Babette \"Mary\" Ezra married the Irish poet Louis MacNeice.\n\n"}

They are usually situated near the luxury boxes, whether right above, right below, or sandwiched between two levels of luxury boxes. Club-level seating is typically considered a more exclusive class of seating than elsewhere in the venue, other than the luxury boxes.\n\nUnlike some luxury box levels, most club levels do not wrap entirely around the venue. Some club levels stop at a certain point, giving way to an expansion of the mezzanine, while others give way to lower-class luxury boxes (such as \"party suites\"). A notable exception to this is Emirates Stadium in London, which has a complete tier of club seating.\n\nClub levels normally provide fans several additional amenities than standard seating. Club-level seating is open to the elements, as opposed to the entirely enclosed luxury boxes, which gives more of an outdoor impression at roofless and open-roof stadiums and arenas. Club-level seating is normally bought on a contract basis to allow for maximum profit on the part of the venue.\n\nThe club level provides fans with special access to an indoor part of the venue exclusive to fans with special tickets. These areas are climate-controlled year-round and allow access to special restaurants, bars, merchandise stands, and lounge areas of the venue. Concession stands and vendors on the club level also often offer different menus than in other stands to give more of a special feel to the club. These areas are closed off to the rest of the venue, and they usually can only be accessed through the exclusive, private club entrances.\n"}

She married Shane Richie in 1990, and they had two sons before splitting up in 1997 and divorcing in 1999. She gave birth to a daughter, Ciara, on 19 June 2001 and became engaged to her longtime boyfriend Ray Fensome (a musician who is from Leeds) when he proposed on her 40th birthday in 2005. They married in November 2007. On 6 February 2018, Nolan announced that she and Fensome were getting divorced after two years of marital difficulties. The divorce was finalised in mid-December 2018, and Nolan said that she and Fensome have been able to remain good friends with each other since the divorce.\n\nHer late mother, Maureen, was an Alzheimer's sufferer. In 2006 Nolan opened the first Alzheimer's Society information centre on the Fylde coast. Maureen died on 30 December 2007.\n\nNolan has gained media attention at times for controversial statements and opinions. In 2005, on \"Loose Women\", she claimed that if her 16-year-old son passed his exams then she would pay for him to go on a sex trip to Amsterdam and that she had given her fiancé Ray Fensome permission to have a one-night stand during the proposed trip. She was criticised by Shane Richie, who said he was \"disgusted and appalled\" by her comments about their son, and that he hoped and assumed \"it was said in total jest.\" English doctor and author Miriam Stoppard said of Nolan's comments, \"the world's gone insane\" and claimed that Nolan seemed to be shirking her responsibilities to deliver sex education.\n\nHowever, Nolan defended her comments, saying that she had told her son that she would pay for a long weekend for him anywhere in the world and that he had mentioned how he and his mates had \"always wanted to go to Amsterdam to see the red light district. If he planned to go on a trip to Ibiza everybody would have thought that was fine, even though he would probably have unprotected sex with lots of girls.\" In the \"News of the World\" newspaper she said, \"In an ideal world I'd never condone my son sleeping with hookers, but it's a fact of life that boys of his age have casual sex. So if I'm pushed, I'd rather he does it somewhere well-policed and where the girls have health checks than behind the wall of a club in Ibiza with absolutely no safeguards.\"\n\nShe added about her comments about Fensome, \"In all honesty, I couldn't care less [if he does]. What bothers me more is the thought of Ray going into a bar, chatting up a really stunning girl, having sex with her, spending the night and waking up with her the next morning. I couldn't cope with that.\"\n\nIn January 2007 Nolan courted further controversy when, during a debate on \"Loose Women\" about gay adoption, she stated that gay people should not be allowed to adopt children, and said that \"there's only so much I want to accept\".\n\nIn May 2015 she sparked outrage from viewers by comparing gay rights with supporting ISIS and by saying that bakery owners should be permitted to discriminate against same-sex couples who wish to buy a wedding cake. Her comments were made on \"Loose Women\" after a Belfast bakery company was successfully sued for refusing to bake a cake in support of same-sex marriage. Following the show viewers took to Twitter and called for ITV to fire Nolan for making the comments.\n\nIn August 2018 she and fellow panellists Linda Nolan, Janet Street-Porter and Linda Robson caused controversy due to their actions in an on-air argument with Kim Woodburn, which led to the latter leaving the show during an advertisement break. Woodburn, with whom Coleen had an onscreen history of a sour relationship (see \"Celebrity Big Brother\"), had been invited on the show to reconcile with Nolan. The row led to over 7,000 complaints to Ofcom, mostly centring on Nolan and her fellow panellists bullying of Woodburn. The controversy led her to take a break from Loose Women and also postpone her Never Too Late solo concert tour. Her management said that she was not strong enough to handle the criticism and it was unknown when she would return but it was assured that she is still a member of the \"Loose Women\" panel. She returned to the panel on 3 December 2018.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Only the T3 tankers were larger \"navy oilers\" of the period. Some 533 T2s were built between 1940 and the end of 1945. They were used to transport fuel oil, diesel fuel, gasoline and sometimes black oil-crude oil. Post war many T2s remained in use; like other hastily built World War II ships pressed into peacetime service, there were safety concerns. As was found during the war, the United States Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation in 1952 stated that in cold weather the ships were prone to metal fatigue cracking, so were \"belted\" with steel straps. This occurred after two T2s, and , split in two off Cape Cod within hours of each other. \"Pendleton\"s sinking is memorialized in \"The Finest Hours\". Engineering inquiries into the problem suggested the cause was poor welding techniques. It was found the steel (that had been successfully used in riveted ship design) was not well suited for the new wartime welding construction. The high sulfur content made the steel brittle and prone to metal fatigue at lower temperatures.\n\nThe T2 design was formalized by the United States Maritime Commission as its medium-sized \"National Defense tanker\", a ship built for merchant service which could be militarized as a fleet auxiliary in time of war. MarCom subsidized the excess cost of naval features beyond normal commercial standards. The T2 was based on two ships built in 1938–1939 by Bethlehem Steel for Socony-Vacuum Oil Company, \"Mobilfuel\" and \"Mobilube\", differing from the Mobil ships principally in the installation of more powerful engines for higher speed. Standard T2s were in total length, with a beam of . Rated at 9,900 tons gross (GRT), with , standard T2s displaced about 21,100 tons. Steam turbines driving a single propeller at delivered a top speed of . Six were built for commerce by Bethlehem-Sparrows Point Shipyard in Maryland, only to be taken over by the United States Navy following the Attack on Pearl Harbor as the .\n\nKeystone Tankships company ordered five tankers in 1940 from Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock of Chester, Pennsylvania, based on the T2 but longer and with increased capacity; Marcom would designate this design T2-A. Bigger but faster, they were in total length, displaced about 22,445 tons, and were rated at 10,600 tons gross with — yet they attained a top speed approaching . All five were requisitioned by the Navy during the war and converted to fleet oilers as the \"Mattaponi\" class.\n\nBy far the most common variety of the T2-type tanker was the T2-SE-A1, another commercial design already being built in 1940 by the Sun Shipbuilding Company for Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. They were long, abeam, with and . Their (steam) turbo-electric transmission system delivered , with maximum thrust of , which produced a top-rated speed of about with a cruising range of up to . After Pearl Harbor, the United States Maritime Commission ordered this model built \"en masse\" to supply U.S. warships already in accelerated production, and provide for the fuel needs of US forces in Europe and the Pacific, as well as to replace the tanker tonnage being lost at an alarming rate to German U-boats. 481 were built in extremely short production times by the Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company of Mobile, Alabama, the Kaiser Company at their Swan Island Yard at Portland, Oregon, the Marinship Corp. of Sausalito, California, and the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Chester, Pennsylvania. During that period, average production time from laying of the keel to \"fitting out\" was 70 days. The record, however, was held by Marinship, which had ready for sea trials in just 33 days.\n\nThe T2-SE-A2 variation, built only by Marinship of Sausalito, was nearly identical to the T2-SE-A1 version, except with rather than 7,240. The A3 variation was essentially an A2 built as a naval oiler from the start, rather than converted later as many A2s were.\n\nDespite the confusing T3 designation, the T3-S-A1s built by Bethlehem Sparrows Point for Standard Oil of New Jersey were identical to the original T2s except for having less powerful engines of .

{"id": "2050012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050012", "title": "Football Follies", "text": "Football Follies\n\nFootball Follies are collections of American football bloopers performed by National Football League players. Produced by NFL Films, these collections also spoof parts of popular culture. Mel Blanc joined in the fun in 1976 with \"The Son of Football Follies\", and returned (in one of his final efforts) in 1989 for \"The Super Duper Football Follies\". In addition, Jonathan Winters was featured in 1987's \"The NFL TV Follies\", intended as a parody of the relationship between football and television.\n\nThe series of films currently airs on NFL Network, usually as filler programming when a live game is airing on another network (most commonly Sunday or Monday Night Football).\n\nThe first film using sports bloopers to satirize PR hype nearly didn't get off the ground. The coaching staff of the Philadelphia Eagles brought the film to the Eagles training camp in 1969, but feared that the Eagle players would be angry when they saw the mistakes made by themselves and other NFL players. Instead, the film was met with roaring laughter, and was an instant hit with the players.\n\nSimon Gribben, was a producer, director, writer and editor at NFL Films from 1967 to '70. The Johnny Carson Show contacted the league owned film company and asked if they could send them some football bloopers for Carson to show once a week. A contract was signed with the 'Tonight Show' and NFL Films management decided that Gribben was the guy for the job. He pulled blooper shots out of each weeks footage edited them together and wrote a clever script which Carson read on the air. The Carson blooper segment was very popular. As a result Ed Sabol, executive producer at NFL Films came up with an idea to do a half hour version of the bloopers as one of the episodes that they were producing for the weekly show,'NFL Action' hosted by Pat Summerall. Sabol assigned the project to Gribben. To accomplish this thousands of feet of archive film would have to be screened. He needed to find the funny shots before he could write. He asked two staffers and a freelancer with film library experience to become members of his production team. Lavon Bebler, Vicki Denenberg and David Ewing. The show had an air date, so they were on deadline. Everyone worked long hours to get the job done. Jack Newman did sound design, Phil Spieler scored it. John Hentz supervised the production. The show aired during the summer of1969. When it came to his credit Gribben was too clever. He did audio credits naming each person who worked on the show. For his credit he used a shot himself standing on the sidelines of a game. He had a beard at the time. When that shot appeared the narrator said \"Produced and directed by that fellow with beard.\" By doing this he relinquished his claim to authorship. He quit NFL Films in 1970. From then on NFL Films did not give Simon Gribben credit for creating the film. It is a mystery. Gribben speculates that maybe they were mad at him for quitting on them. No one knows. Both Ed and Steve Sabol have passed away. Only they could answer the question of why they would not give Gribben credit where credit was due. Sequels were done almost every year from then on. When Steve Sabol had his own syndicated TV show he would occasionally show segments of the Follies Film. On one show he posed the question of who created the original Follies. He stated that it was one of the janitors who came up with the idea. (I am David Ewing. I was one of the assistant editors on the original Follies film. I can testify that Simon wrote every word of the script and worked his butt off editing the film.) The Football Follies went on to be the most successful film NFL Films ever produced. This year, 2019 is the 50th anniversary of the first Follies. Simon Gribben has yet to be given the credit he deserves for the wonderfully funny film he created for NFL Films.\n\nIn 1985, NFL Films released The Best of the Football Follies, a look back at some of the series' highlights. This special features two new segments: The story of two teams whose history was filled with follies - the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the lovable losers the New Orleans Saints, who had gone 78-203 in their history with only two seasons at .500 (both teams would win Super Bowls in the decades following the special); the special also included outtakes from the NFL's Best Ever Coaches (produced in 1981), focusing on head coaches (notably Dick Vermeil during the 1980 NFC Championship Game and Hank Stram at Super Bowl IV) who were wired for sound.\n\nIn the 1994, as part of NFL Films' celebration of NFL's 75th anniversary, 100 Greatest Follies counted down the 100 greatest bloopers in NFL history, chosen, according to the video's promotion, a \"secret ballot\" in NFL Films. The 100 follies shown, with the exception of follies 1-10, were not shown in numerical order, but were categorized by how certain follies related by different topics. The list of the categories were as follows:\n\n\nSeveral imitators have surfaced in response to the original \"Football Follies\", even in sports other than football.

{"id": "2050029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050029", "title": "On-Line Isotope Mass Separator", "text": "On-Line Isotope Mass Separator\n\nThe ISOLDE Radioactive Ion Beam Facility, is an on-line isotope separator facility located at heart of the CERN accelerator complex on the Franco-Swiss border. The name of the facility is an acronym for Isotope Separator On Line DEvice. Created in 1964, the ISOLDE facility started delivering radioactive ion beams to users in 1967. Originally located at the SynchroCyclotron accelerator (CERN's first ever particle accelerator), the facility has been upgraded several times most notably in 1992 when the whole facility was moved to be connected to CERN's ProtonSynchroton Booster (PSB). Entering its 6th decade of existence, ISOLDE is currently the oldest facility still in operation at CERN. From the first pioneering ISOL beams to the latest technical advances allowing for the production of the most exotic species, ISOLDE benefits a wide range of physics communities with applications covering nuclear, atomic, molecular and solid-state physics, but also biophysics and astrophysics, as well as high-precision experiments looking for physics beyond the Standard Model. The facility is operated by the ISOLDE Collaboration, comprising CERN and fifteen (mostly) European countries. As of 2019, more than 800 experimentalists around the world (including all continents) are coming to ISOLDE to perform typically 45 different experiments per year.\n\nRadioactive nuclei are produced at ISOLDE by shooting a high-energy (1.4GeV) beam of protons delivered by CERN's PSBooster accelerator on a 20 cm thick target. Several target materials are used depending on the desired final isotopes that are requested by the experimentalists. The interaction of the proton beam with the target material produces radioactive species through spallation, fragmentation and fission reactions. They are subsequently extracted from the bulk of the target material through thermal diffusion processes by heating the target to about 2000 degrees. The cocktail of produced isotopes is ultimately filtered using one of ISOLDE's two magnetic dipole mass separators to yield the desired isobar of interest. The time required for the extraction process to occur is dictated by the nature of the desired isotope and/or that of the target material and places a lower limit on the half-life of isotopes which can be produced by this method, and is typically of the order of a few milliseconds. Once extracted, the isotopes are directed either to one of several low-energy nuclear physics experiments or an isotope-harvesting area. An upgrade of the pre-existing REX post-accelerator, the latest addition to the ISOLDE facility is the HIE-ISOLDE superconducting linac which allows the re-acceleration of the radioisotopes to higher energies.\n\nThe number of protons in a nucleus determine what element it belongs to: to have a neutral atom, the same number of electrons circulate around the atomic nucleus and these define the chemical properties of the element. However, a specific element can occur with different ‘nuclei’, each having the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. These variations of the element are called its isotopes. For example, three isotopes of the element carbon are called carbon-12, carbon-13 and carbon-14; which have 6, 7, 8 neutrons respectively. The numbers added after the element name are the mass number of the isotope i.e. the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. \n\nEach isotope of an element has different stability depending on their numbers of protons and neutrons. The word nuclide is used to refer to the isotopes with respect to their stability and nuclear energy state. Stable nuclides can be found in nature but unstable (i.e. radioactive) ones cannot because they spontaneously decay into more stable nuclides. Scientists use accelerators and nuclear reactors to produce and examine radioactive nuclides. The neutron-to-proton ratio has a strong impact on the properties of the isotope in question. Most notably, as this ratio strongly departs from unity the isotopes usually become ever increasingly short-lived. The time required to lose half of a population of a given nuclide through radioactive decays, the so-called half-life, is a measure of how stable an isotope is. \n\nSimilar to the periodic table of elements for atoms, nuclides are usually visually represented on a table (the so-called Segré chart or chart of nuclides) where the proton number is represented on the y-axis while the x-axis represents the neutron number. \n\nIn 1950, two Danish physicists Otto Kofoed-Hansen and Karl-Ove Nielsen discovered a new technique for producing radioisotopes which enabled producing isotopes with shorter half-lives than earlier methods. Ten years later, in Vienna, at a symposium about separating radioisotopes, plans for an ‘on-line’ isotope separator were published. Using these plans, CERN's Nuclear Chemistry Group (NCG) built a prototype on-line mass separator coupled to target and ion source, which was bombarded by a proton beam delivered by CERN's the Synchro-Cyclotron. The test was a success and showed that the Synchro-Cyclotron was an appropriate machine for on-line rare isotope production. In 1964, a proposal for an isotope separator on-line project was accepted by the CERN Director-General and the ISOLDE project began.\n\nThe \"Finance Committee\" for the project set up with five members, then extended to 12. As the term \"Finance Committee\" had other connotations, it was decided 'until a better name was found' to call the project ISOLDE and the committee the ISOLDE Committee. In May 1966, the Synchro-Cyclotron shut down for some major modifications. One of these modifications was the construction of a new tunnel to send proton beams to a future underground hall that would be dedicated to ISOLDE. In 1965, as the underground hall at CERN was being excavated, the isotope separator for ISOLDE was being constructed in Aarhus. Separator construction made good progress in 1966 and the underground hall was finished in 1967. On 16 October 1967, the first experiment carried out and successfully.\n\nShortly after the ISOLDE experimental program started, some major improvements for SC were planned. In 1972 the SC shut down to upgrade its beam intensity by changing its radiofrequency system. The SC improvement program increased the primary proton beam intensity by about a factor of 100. To be able to handle this high-intensity ISOLDE facility also needed some modifications. After necessary modifications, the new ISOLDE facility also known as ISOLDE 2 was launched in 1974. Its new target design combined with the increased beam intensity from the SC led to significant enhancements in the number of nuclides produced. However, after some time the external beam current from the SC started to be a limiting factor. The collaboration discussed the possibility of moving the facility to an accelerator that could reach higher current values but decided on building another separator with ultra-modern design, for the facility. The new high-resolution separator, ISOLDE 3, was in full use by the end of the 80s. In 1990 a new ion source named Resonance Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS) was installed at the facility to selectively and efficiently produce radioactive beams.\n\nThe Synchro-Cyclotron was decommissioned in 1990, after having been in operation for more than three decades. As a consequence, the collaboration decided to relocate the ISOLDE facility to the Proton Synchrotron, and place the targets in an external beam from its 1 GeV booster. The construction of the new ISOLDE experimental hall started about three months prior to the decommissioning of the Synchro-Cyclotron. With the relocation also came several upgrades. The most notable being the installation of two new magnetic dipole mass separators. One general-purpose separator with only one magnet and the other one is a high-resolution separator with two magnets. The latter one is a reconstructed version of the ISOLDE 3. The first experiment at the new facility, known as ISOLDE PSB, was performed on 26 June 1992. In May 1995, two industrial robots were installed in the facility to handle the targets and ion sources units without human intervention.\n\nTo diversify the scientific activities of the facility, a post-accelerator system called REX-ISOLDE (Radioactive beam EXperiments at ISOLDE) was inaugurated at the facility in 2001. With this new addition, nuclear reaction experiments which require a high-energy radioactive ion beam could now be performed at ISOLDE. \n\nThe facility building was extended in 2005 to allow more experiments to be set up. ISCOOL, an ion cooler and buncher, increasing the beam quality for experiments was installed at the facility in 2007. Furthermore, HIE-ISOLDE (High Intensity and Energy Upgrade), a project for upgrading beam intensity and energy, was approved in 2009 and has been completed in several phases. In late 2013 the construction of a new facility for medical research called CERN MEDICIS (MEDICal Isotopes Collected from ISOLDE) started. The facility is designed to work with proton beams that have already passed a first target. Of the incident beams, only 10% are actually stopped in the targets and achieve their objective, while the remaining 90% are not used.\n\nIn 2013, during the \"Long Shutdown 1\", three ISOLDE buildings were demolished. They've been built again as a new single building with a new control room, a data storage room, three laser laboratories, a biology and materials laboratory, and a room for visitors. Another building extension for the MEDICIS project and several others equipped with electrical, cooling and ventilation systems to be used for the HIE-ISOLDE project in the future were also built. In addition, the robots which were installed for the handling of radioactive targets have been replaced with more modern robots. In 2015, for the first time, a radioactive isotope beam could be accelerated to an energy level of 4.3 MeV per nucleon in the ISOLDE facility thanks to the HIE-ISOLDE upgrades. In late 2017, the CERN-MEDICIS facility produced its first radioisotopes.\n\nBefore ISOLDE, the radioactive nuclides were transported from the production area to the laboratory for examination. In ISOLDE, from the production to the measurements all the processes are connected, or in other words, they're \"on-line\". Radioactive nuclides are produced by bombarding a target with protons from a particle accelerator. Then they are ionized using surface, plasma or laser ion sources before being separated according to their masses by using magnetic dipole mass separators. After producing the beam of the preferred isotope, the beam can be cooled and/or bunched to reduce the emittance and energy spreads of the beam. Then the beam is directed to either low-energy experiments or a post-accelerator to increase its energy.\n\nAt THE ISOLDE facility, the main beam for reactions comes from the Proton Synchrotron. This incoming proton beam has an energy value of 1.4 GeV and its average intensity is up to 2 μA. The facility has two separators. One of them called the general purpose separator (GPS) and which is made with an H-type magnet with a bending radius of 1.5 m and a bending angle of 70°. Its resolution is approximately 800. The other separator is called the high resolution separator (HRS) is made from two C-type dipole magnets. Their bending radii are 1m and bending angles are 90° and 60°. The overall resolution of these two magnets can reach values higher than 7000.\n\nThe class A laboratories, buildings for the HIE-ISOLDE and MEDICIS projects, and building 508 which serves as a home for THE ISOLDE control rooms as well as other operations can be seen on the sketch. The 1.4 GeV proton beam from the PS Booster, coming from the right on the sketch, is being directed to one of the separators. The general purpose separator sends beams to an electronic switchyard which allows scientists to conduct up to three simultaneous experiments. The high resolution separator with two magnets and beam-correcting elements, can be used for experiments that require higher mass resolution values. One branch from the GPS switchyard and HRS are connected to a common central beamline which is used to provide beam to various experimental setups dedicated to nuclear spectroscopy and nuclear orientation, laser spectroscopy, high-precision mass spectrometry, solid-state and surface studies.\n\nThe traditional ion source units at ISOLDE are based on surface or plasma ionization techniques. In addition to those techniques a laser based ion source called RILIS, which allows an element sensitive selection of isotopes, is also being used for some elements. To be able to deliver beams with higher quality and increased sensitivity an ion cooler and buncher called ISCOOL, is being used in the HRS separator. All in all, the ISOLDE facility provides 1300 isotopes from 75 elements in the periodic table.\n\nThe project CERN-MEDICIS, which is a part of the ISOLDE facility, is running to supply radioactive isotopes for medical applications. The experiments at ISOLDE facility use about half of the protons in the beams from PS Booster. The beams preserve 90% of their intensities after hitting a standard target in the facility. CERN-MEDICIS project uses the remaining protons on a target that is placed behind the HRS target to produce radioisotopes for medical purposes. The irradiated target is then being carried to MEDICIS building by using an automated conveyor to separate and collect the isotopes of interest.\n\nAccelerating them to higher energy levels is a good technique to be able to examine radioactive isotopes further. For this purpose, a post-accelerator called REX-ISOLDE, which accelerates the newly produced radioisotopes up to 3 MeV, is being used at ISOLDE facility. The accelerated isotopes are being directed to the target setup of a nuclear spectroscopy experiment, which includes charged-particle detectors and the MINIBALL gamma ray detector. Originally intended to accelerate light isotopes, REX-ISOLDE project has passed this goal and provided post-accelerated beams of a wider mass range, namely from He up to Ra. REX-ISOLDE has delivered accelerated beams of more than 100 isotopes of more than 30 elements since its commissioning.\n\nTo be able to satisfy the ever-increasing needs of higher quality, intensity, and energy of the production beam is very important for facilities such as ISOLDE. As the latest response to satisfy these needs, HIE-ISOLDE upgrade project has been started. Due to its phased planning, the upgrade project will be carried out with the least impact on the experiments continuing in the facility. The project includes an energy increase for the REX-ISOLDE up to 10 MeV as well as resonator and cooler upgrades, enhancement of the input beam from PS Booster, improvements on targets, ion sources, and mass separators. As of 2018 most of the energy upgrades, including increasing REX-ISOLDE energy to 10MeV, completed and phase two is concluded. Upgrades about intensity are planned to be done in phase three. As a state-of-the-art project, HIE-ISOLDE is expected to expand the research opportunities in ISOLDE facility to the next level. When completed, the upgraded facility will be able to host advanced experiments in fields like nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics.\n\nAttached to ISOLDE is in building 508 one of the largest solid sate physics laboratory for perturbed angular correlation that receive its major funding from BMBF. It uses about 20-25% of ISOLDE's beam time. Its major focus is the study of functional materials, such as metals, semiconductors, insulators and bio-molecules. The main use of exotic PAC-isotopes, such as Cd, Hg, Pb as well as transition metal isotopes are important for materials research. Because many isotopes have half-lives that are in the range of minutes and hours, experiments need to be performed on-site. Additional methods are tracer diffusion, online-Mössbauer spectroscopy (Mn) and photoluminescence with radioaktive nuclei.\n\nBelow is the list of some physics activities done at ISOLDE facility.\n\n\n\n"}

It is generally accepted to extend from Spencer Gulf east to the Barrier Highway, including the coastal plain, the southern part of the Flinders Ranges, and the northern part of the Mount Lofty Ranges. The area was settled as early as 1840 (South Australia settlement began in 1836) and provided early farming and mining outputs for the fledgling colony. Farming is still significant in the area, particularly wheat, sheep and grapevines. There are not currently any significant mining activities in the Mid North.\n\nGrapes are grown in the Clare Valley and Southern Flinders Ranges wine regions. Copper was formerly mined at Kapunda and Burra.\n\nThe main indigenous group of the Mid North are the Ngadjuri people. There were disputes and conflicts between the white settlers and the Aborigines, particularly in the 1850s and 1860s, but Ngadjuri people remain in the area and hold native title rights over the area. The extreme south west of the Mid North region is a part of the traditional lands of the Kaurna people.\n\nFor the purposes of weather districts, the Mid North region is divided horizontally into \"Flinders\" for the northern portion and \"Mid North\" for the southern portion by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Towns for which forecasts are published by the bureau demonstrate major townships within the bounds of the region. In the northern portion forecasts are published for: Hawker, Port Augusta and Ororroo. Towns for which forecasts are published in the southern region are: Port Pirie, Jamestown, Crystal Brook, Clare, Roseworthy and Snowtown.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2050033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050033", "title": "Guitar Craft", "text": "Guitar Craft\n\nGuitar Craft (GC) was a series of guitar and personal-development classes, founded and often presented by Robert Fripp, who is best known for his work with the rock band King Crimson. Guitar Craft courses introduced students to new standard tuning and ergonomic playing with the plectrum (pick), often using steel-stringed, acoustic, shallow-body guitars from the Ovation Guitar Company.\n\nBy 2011, three thousand students had completed the courses. Students who continue to practise Guitar Craft playing have been called \"crafties\". Notable crafties include Trey Gunn and the California Guitar Trio (all four of whom, with Fripp, constituted The Robert Fripp String Quintet) and Markus Reuter. Crafties have recorded several albums under the name of \"Robert Fripp and the League of Crafty Guitarists\", for example.\n\nAfter 25 years, the Guitar Craft movement transformed its activities into Guitar Circles, which offer introductory courses and performances in Europe and the Americas. Guitar Circles meet in many cities; in particular, The Seattle Guitar Circle meets for practices and performances and also sponsors a school.\n\nFripp's Guitar Craft courses were first offered by the American Society for Continuous Education, near the Claymont Court site in Charles Town, West Virginia. Guitar Craft stated that it offers ways to develop relationships with the guitar, music, and oneself.\n\nGC popularized New Standard Tuning (NST), Fripp's guitar tuning using the notes (C2 G2 D3 A3 E4 G4 low to high). Learning NST enabled guitarists to experience playing the guitar as a beginner, albeit usually a sophisticated beginner. At Guitar Craft seminars and courses, students work exclusively in NST. For new GC students, NST is unfamiliar, and so all students have the same experience of renewing their guitar playing while having difficulty adjusting previous habits.\n\nGuitar Craft courses welcomed students with no previous experience of guitar playing, although most students had been playing for at least two years, so that they had sufficient musculature. Fripp has stated that previous experiences sometimes burdened players with bad habits and inappropriate expectations.\n\nFor the level-one GC course, the curriculum offers seven \"primary exercises\". The first primary exercise for the left hand is followed by the second primary exercise for the right hand, which teaches alternate picking.\n\nThe guitar pick (plectrum) is held between the thumb and the index finger. The thumb is not bent forward at the first digit from the tip. Rather the thumb is brought to the index finger by its lowest joint, which maintains the convexity of the thumb's ball at the base of the hand; a collapsed thumb-ball signals improper technique. The four fingers point towards the elbow. The other three fingers curl inwards in a relaxed position, supporting the index finger, each successively supporting its predecessor. Holding the pick in this manner relaxes the hand, arm, and shoulder, allowing playing without tension. For a single note, the string is struck by only the tip of the triangular GC pick, with the force orthogonal to the string and the pick tangent to the string. The pick-string contact takes place above the sound-hole.\n\nIn the fundamental technique, the picking hand is suspended above the strings and moves over the strings without pivoting on the ball of the hand or touching the strings or bridge. Holding the pick in this manner promotes relaxation from the fingers to the back, and it also facilitates the alternate picking of single strings and the cross picking among several strings. Fripp, who is known for his cross-picking, teaches the technique in Guitar Craft. Fripp's cross-picking has influenced many other guitarists, particularly in progressive rock. The fourth primary exercise introduces cross picking.\n\nFor the fretting hand, the technique is close to the left-hand technique of Spanish classical guitar. The thumb is placed in the middle of the back of the neck, not over the back of the neck (to finger bass strings).\n\nFripp recommended that students adopt the Ovation 1867 Legend steel-string guitar, which had a shallow body. \"Fripp liked the way the Ovation 1867 fitted against his body, which made it possible for him to assume the right-arm picking position he had developed using electric guitars over the years; on deeper-bodied guitars, the Frippian arm position is impossible without uncomfortable contortions\", according to Tamm. While the 1867 Legend is no longer manufactured, it influenced the design of the Guitar Craft Pro Model of Guitar Craft Guitars, which has been endorsed by Fripp. Besides the Ovation 1867 Legend, other Ovation shallow-body guitars are widely used in Guitar Craft and recommended for use in related performing groups, such as the Guitar Circle of Europe. The Ovation's truss rod can offset the increased tension of the NST strings, protecting the neck from bending.\n\nGuitar Craft aimed at personal development, not only through guitar playing and music appreciation, but also through improved living. Students were offered instruction in practices such as \"relaxed sitting\", T'ai chi ch'uan, and the Alexander Technique. These practices are valuable especially for guitarists, who practice for at least an hour daily and therefore benefit from a stable and comfortable posture. While relaxed sitting has been practiced in Hinduism and Buddhism, the GC practice of relaxed sitting is pursued without reference to any religious tradition. Participants are encouraged to think critically and particularly to feel free to decline any practice as they see fit.\n\nCourses take place regularly in Latin America, North America, and Europe. By 2011, three thousand students had completed courses. Students who have completed a GC course and who continue GC practices are called \"crafty guitarists\" or \"crafties\". Notable crafties include Trey Gunn and the California Guitar Trio, who joined Fripp in forming the Robert Fripp String Quintet. GC-related Guitar Circles and other ensembles perform in Europe, the USA, Argentina, and Mexico.\n\nGC's official performance ensemble has been \"The League of Crafty Guitarists\". Robert Fripp and the League of Crafty Guitarists has released several albums, via Discipline Global Mobile. The League of Crafty Guitarists has been directed by Hernán Nuñez since 2002; Nuñez, a long-time instructor of GC, is one of the developers of the Guitar Craft Pro Model, whose design has been influenced by that of the Ovation Legend. For organizational logos, Guitar Craft and the League of Crafty Guitarists use a knotwork design, which was inspired by the red knotwork design appearing on later covers of the \"Discipline\" album by King Crimson; both designs were made by Steve Ball.\n\nThe Guitar-Craft experience and the League of Crafty Guitarists trained guitarists who went on to form new bands, such as the California Guitar Trio and Trey Gunn; the California Guitar Trio and Gunn toured with Fripp as The Robert Fripp String Quintet.\n\nBill Rieflin, the drummer for R.E.M. following Bill Berry's retirement, developed \"a musical style that beautifully balances mindfulness and force\" through his long association with Guitar Craft; Reiflin stated that \"I couldn't possibly describe in any detail the impact this has had in my life; I can say that it was and continues to be significant. Were I to say 'life-changing,' this would be true, but it wouldn't begin to communicate the depth of the experience.\"\n\nOther alumni of the League of Crafty Guitarists include members of Los Gauchos Alemanes, such as U.S. guitarist Steve Ball; Ball is associated with the Seattle Guitar Circle, along with LCG alumnus Curt Golden. German crafty Markus Reuter went on to play Warr Guitar in Europa String Choir and centrozoon, subsequently designing his own touch guitar and playing in Stick Men and The Crimson ProjeKct in addition to a solo career. The collection \"A Plague of Crafty Guitarists\" features the following Guitar-Craft alumni, who were listed in a review by Barry Cleveland: Tobin Buttram, Nigel Gavin, Geary Street Quartet, Bill Hibbits, Janssen and Jensen, Sur Pacifico, Playmovil, and Santos Luminosos.\n\nIn February 2009, Fripp recommended that Guitar Craft cease to exist on its 25th anniversary in 2010. In March 2010, a 25th Anniversary Course marking the Completion of Guitar Craft was held. In practice, Guitar Craft continues with a focus on \"Guitar Circles\" and \"The Orchestra of Crafty Guitarists\". Courses entitled \"Introduction to Guitar Circle\" continue to be held in the Americas and in Europe. \nThe website of Guitar Craft contains links to related and successor organizations and associations. Guitar Craft inspired the founding of the Seattle Guitar Circle and the Seattle Circle Guitar School in 2010.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lawson had three sisters: the TV chef and writer Nigella Lawson; Horatia; and Thomasina (who died of breast cancer in 1993 in her early 30s). Their mother, an heir to the Lyons Corner House empire, died from liver cancer in 1985. Lawson's father was Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1983 and 1989.\n\nLawson was married to Jane Whytehead from 1982 until 1991.\n\nHe has been married to Rosa Monckton, a Roman Catholic, the daughter of the 2nd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, since 1991. The Lawsons have two daughters (another daughter, Natalia, was stillborn), Domenica and Savannah; Domenica has Down syndrome.\n\nLawson joined the BBC as a researcher, and then wrote for the \"Financial Times\". From 1990 until 1995 he was editor of \"The Spectator\" magazine, a post his father had occupied from 1966 to 1970. In his capacity as editor of \"The Spectator\" he conducted, in June 1990, an interview with the cabinet minister Nicholas Ridley in which Ridley expressed opinions immensely hostile to Germany and the European Community, likening the initiatives of Jacques Delors and others to those of Hitler. Lawson added to the damage caused, by claiming that the opinions expressed by Ridley were shared by the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. Ridley was forced to resign from the cabinet shortly after this incident. Although some senior Tories called for Lawson to be fired, his proprietor, Conrad Black, stood by him. Under Lawson's five-year editorship, the magazine's circulation grew from 30,000 to 50,000.\n\nFrom 1995 until 2005, Lawson was editor of \"The Sunday Telegraph\". In 2006, he started to write columns for \"The Independent\" newspaper and in 2008, he became the main columnist for \"The Sunday Times\". In his article for \"The Independent\" dated 2 September 2013, he wrote that it would be his last for that newspaper, although he did not give a reason.\n\nHe is a strong chess player and is the author of \"The Inner Game\", on the inside story of the 1993 World Chess Championship. He was also involved in the organisation of the 1983 World Chess championship semi-final. Lawson writes a monthly chess column in \"Standpoint\". In 2014 he was elected president of the English Chess Federation.\n\nRichard Tomlinson alleged in 2001 that Lawson had worked with the intelligence agency MI6, but Lawson denied being an agent. Boris Johnson, then editor of \"The Spectator\", wrote a pseudonymous article on the subject which Lawson (then editor of \"The Sunday Telegraph\") found \"intensely annoying\" because of the potential increase in the threat to his newspaper's foreign correspondents. However, in 1998, Lawson had acknowledged that articles written in 1994, under a false name with a Sarajevo dateline while he was editor of the \"Spectator\" magazine, were \"probably\" written by an MI6 officer.\n\nIn 2016, Lawson attributed the result of the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum to the legalisation of same-sex marriage.\n\n"}

{"id": "2050041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050041", "title": "Sampling frame", "text": "Sampling frame\n\nIn statistics, a sampling frame is the source material or device from which a sample is drawn. It is a list of all those within a population who can be sampled, and may include individuals, households or institutions.\n\nImportance of the sampling frame is stressed by Jessen and Salant and Dillman.\n\nIn the most straightforward cases, such as when dealing with a batch of material from a production run, or using a census, it is possible to identify and measure every single item in the population and to include any one of them in our sample; this is known as \"direct element sampling\". However, in many other cases this is not possible; either because it is cost-prohibitive (reaching every citizen of a country) or impossible (reaching all humans alive).\n\nHaving established the frame, there are a number of ways for organizing it to improve efficiency and effectiveness. It's at this stage that the researcher should decide whether the sample is in fact to be the whole population and would therefore be a census.\n\nThis list should also facilitate access to the selected sampling units. A frame may also provide additional 'auxiliary information' about its elements; when this information is related to variables or groups of interest, it may be used to improve survey design. While not necessary for simple sampling, a sampling frame used for more advanced sample techniques, such as stratified sampling, may contain additional information (such as demographic information). For instance, an electoral register might include name and sex; this information can be used to ensure that a sample taken from that frame covers all demographic categories of interest. (Sometimes the auxiliary information is less explicit; for instance, a telephone number may provide some information about location.\n\nAn ideal sampling frame will have the following qualities:\n\nThe most straightforward type of frame is a list of elements of the population (preferably the entire population) with appropriate contact information. For example, in an opinion poll, possible sampling frames include an electoral register or a telephone directory. Other sampling frames can include employment records, school class lists, patient files in a hospital, organizations listed in a thematic database, and so on. On a more practical levels, sampling frames have the form of computer files.\n\nNot all frames explicitly list population elements; some list only 'clusters'. For example, a street map can be used as a frame for a door-to-door survey; although it doesn't show individual houses, we can select streets from the map and then select houses on those streets. This offers some advantages: such a frame would include people who have recently moved and are not yet on the list frames discussed above, and it may be easier to use because it doesn't require storing data for every unit in the population, only for a smaller number of clusters.\n\nThe sampling frame must be representative of the population and this is a question outside the scope of statistical theory demanding the judgment of experts in the particular subject matter being studied. All the above frames omit some people who will vote at the next election and contain some people who will not; some frames will contain multiple records for the same person. People not in the frame have no prospect of being sampled.\n\nBecause a cluster-based frame contains less information about the population, it may place constraints on the sample design, possibly requiring the use of less efficient sampling methods and/or making it harder to interpret the resulting data.\n\nStatistical theory tells us about the uncertainties in extrapolating from a sample to the frame. It should be expected that sample frames, will always contain some mistakes. In some cases, this may lead to sampling bias. Such bias should be minimized, and identified, although avoiding it completely in a real world is nearly impossible. One should also not assume that sources which claim to be unbiased and representative are such.\n\nIn defining the frame, practical, economic, ethical, and technical issues need to be addressed. The need to obtain timely results may prevent extending the frame far into the future. The difficulties can be extreme when the population and frame are disjoint. This is a particular problem in forecasting where inferences about the future are made from historical data. In fact, in 1703, when Jacob Bernoulli proposed to Gottfried Leibniz the possibility of using historical mortality data to predict the probability of early death of a living man, Gottfried Leibniz recognized the problem in replying:\n\nLeslie Kish posited four basic problems of sampling frames:\n\nProblems like those listed can be identified by the use of pre-survey tests and pilot studies.\n"}
{"id": "2050042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050042", "title": "Alisa (Russian band)", "text": "Alisa (Russian band)\n\nAlisa () is a Russian hard rock band, who are credited as one of the most influential bands in the Russian rock movement.\n\nAlisa was formed in November 1983 by bassist Svyatoslav Zadery. The band's name originated from Zadery's nickname. The band's lineup was finally completed in 1984, when new vocalist Kostya Kinchev (real name Konstantin Panfilov) and guitarist Petr Samoylov joined. Their debut album \"Energia\" was recorded between 1985 and 1986, released by state publishing monopoly Melodiya in 1988 and sold more than a million copies.\n\nBut the relations between two leaders, Konstantin and Zadery, were deteriorating, and finally Svyatoslav departed from the band. This occurred just one hour before Alisa was to perform at a concert. Alisa had to ask Kino bassist Igor Tihomirov to replace him for one concert. Later Zadery created his own band Nateh! ( - \"Take that!\"). Zadery died on 6 May 2011 due to complications from a stroke at the age of 50.\n\nThe growing popularity of the band created a fan community called the Army of Alisa, known for their rough behaviour at concerts. It led to animosity between the band and Soviet officials. In 1987, the newspaper \"Smena\" accused Alisa's leader Kinchev of Nazi propaganda and worshiping Hitler. Kinchev filed a suit for calumny and moral loss compensation. After the year-long court process the magazine published the refutation. Alisa's next album was titled \"Article 206 part 2\", a chapter (\"Hooliganism\") of the USSR Procedural Code, alluding to this process. It was recorded in 1989, but would not be released until 1994 due to the tapes going missing.\n\nThere were more changes in 1988, when guitarist Igor \"Chuma\" Chumychkin joined the band. This change was followed by the heavier sound of next two albums, \"Shabash\" and \"For those Who Fell From the Moon\". Alisa toured through Europe and Israel together with fellow Russian heavy metal band Aria. The album \"Black Mark\", released in 1994, was dedicated to the memory of Chuma, who committed suicide by jumping from a window.\n\nIn the new millennium, with albums such as \"Seychas Pozdnee Chem Ty Dumaesh\" (It is Later Than You Think, 2003) and \"Izgoy\" (Exile, 2005), the sound of Alisa was changed to a heavier one, including elements of nu, industrial and Heavy Metal. Music critics credited Clawfinger as Kinchev's greatest new music influence. This gave Alisa a new fan base among Russian hard rock fans, and three songs from \"Izgoy\" continually reached the top of the NASHE radio chart. Follow-up \"Stat Severa\" and \"Puls Hranitelia Dverey Labyrintha\" were less alternative-oriented and made a blend of older and newer styles. Alisa shot a video for the Wolfhound fantasy movie, though the song itself was cut from the soundtrack.\n\nAccording to public polls, Alisa enjoys high popularity in Russia and around, ranking among top ten most popular russian rock bands, and ranked 1st in Komsomolskaya Pravda readers poll.\n\nKinchev was baptized in 1992 after a series of concerts in Jerusalem, and since then Christianity has been the main influence on his direction and his lyrics. Although early Alisa lyrics were typical for Russian rock - social protest and rock 'n' roll hype - since the late 1990s their main theme has been ideas of Christianity, as well as Russian patriotism and nationalism.\n\nKonstantin is in good relations with the priests of the Russian Orthodox Church, especially Andrey Kuraev. The band has participated in many religion-supporting festivals, such as \"Musicians for the Christ Savior Cathedral\".\n\nKinchev's fairly conservative religious-patriotic shift was viewed unfavourably by some old fans that liked Alisa for their original \"rock\" message.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2050049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050049", "title": "À rebours", "text": "À rebours\n\nÀ rebours (; translated Against Nature or Against the Grain) (1884) is a novel by the French writer Joris-Karl Huysmans. The narrative centers on a single character: Jean des Esseintes, an eccentric, reclusive, ailing aesthete. The last scion of an aristocratic family, Des Esseintes loathes nineteenth century bourgeois society and tries to retreat into an ideal artistic world of his own creation. The narrative is almost entirely a catalogue of the neurotic Des Esseintes' aesthetic tastes, musings on literature, painting and religion, and hyperaesthesic sensory experiences.\n\n\"À rebours\" contains many themes that became associated with the Symbolist aesthetic. In doing so, it broke from Naturalism and became the ultimate example of \"Decadent\" literature, inspiring works such as Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" (1890). In his preface for the 1903 publication of the novel, Huysmans wrote that he had the idea to portray a man \"soaring upwards into dream, seeking refuge in illusions of extravagant fantasy, living alone, far from his century, among memories of more congenial times, of less base surroundings ... each chapter became the sublimate of a specialism, the refinement of a different art; it became condensed into an essence of jewellery, perfumes, religious and secular literature, of profane music and plain-chant.\"\n\n\"À rebours\" marked a watershed in Huysmans' career. His early works had been Naturalist in style, being realistic depictions of the drudgery and squalor of working- and lower-middle-class life in Paris. However, by the early 1880s, Huysmans regarded this approach to fiction as a dead end. As he wrote in his preface to the 1903 reissue of \"À rebours\":It was the heyday of Naturalism, but this school, which should have rendered the inestimable service of giving us real characters in precisely described settings, had ended up harping on the same old themes and was treading water. It scarcely admitted—in theory at least—any exceptions to the rule; thus it limited itself to depicting common existence, and struggled, under the pretext of being true to life, to create characters who would be as close as possible to the average run of mankind.Huysmans decided to keep certain features of the Naturalist style, such as its use of minutely documented realistic detail, but apply them instead to a portrait of an exceptional individual: the protagonist Jean Des Esseintes. In a letter of November 1882, Huysmans told Émile Zola, the leader of the Naturalist school of fiction, that he was changing his style of writing and had embarked on a \"wild and gloomy fantasy\". This \"fantasy\", originally entitled \"Seul\" (\"Alone\"), was to become \"À rebours\".\n\nThe character of Des Esseintes is partly based on Huysmans himself, and the two share many of the same tastes, although Huysmans, on his modest civil-service salary, was hardly able to indulge them to the same extent as his upper-class hero. The writers and dandies Charles Baudelaire and Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly also had some influence, but the most important model was the notorious aristocratic aesthete Robert de Montesquiou, who was also the basis for Baron de Charlus in Marcel Proust's \"À la recherche du temps perdu\". Montesquiou's furnishings bear a strong resemblance to those in Des Esseintes's house:In 1883, to his eternal regret, Montesquiou admitted Stéphane Mallarmé [to his home]. It was late at night when the poet was shown over the house, and the only illumination came from a few scattered candelabra; yet in the flickering light Mallarmé observed that the door-bell was in fact a sacring-bell, that one room was furnished as a monastery cell and another as the cabin of a yacht, and that the third contained a Louis Quinze pulpit, three or four cathedral stalls and a strip of altar railing. He was shown, too, a sled picturesquely placed on a snow-white bearskin, a library of rare books in suitably-coloured bindings and the remains of an unfortunate tortoise whose shell had been coated with gold paint. According to Montesquiou writing many years later in his memoirs, the sight of these marvels left Mallarmé speechless with amazement. 'He went away', records Montesquiou, 'in a state of silent exaltation ... I do not doubt therefore that it was in the most admiring, sympathetic and sincere good faith that he retailed to Huysmans what he had seen during the few moments he spent in Ali Baba's cave.'\n\nThe epigraph is a quotation from Jan van Ruysbroeck ('Ruysbroeck the Admirable'), the fourteenth-century Flemish mystic:I must rejoice beyond the bounds of time...though the world may shudder at my joy, and in its coarseness know not what I mean.\n\nJean des Esseintes is the last member of a powerful and once proud noble family. He has lived an extremely decadent life in Paris, which has left him disgusted with human society. Without telling anyone, he retreats to a house in the countryside, near Fontenay, and decides to spend the rest of his life in intellectual and aesthetic contemplation. In this sense, \"À rebours\" recalls Gustave Flaubert's \"Bouvard et Pécuchet\" (posthumously published in 1881), in which two Parisian copy-clerks decide to retire to the countryside and end up failing at various scientific and scholarly endeavors.\n\nHuysmans' novel is essentially plotless. The protagonist fills the house with his eclectic art collection, which notably consists of reprints of the paintings of Gustave Moreau (such as \"Salome Dancing before Herod\" and \"L'Apparition\"), drawings of Odilon Redon, and engravings of Jan Luyken. Throughout his intellectual experiments, Des Esseintes recalls various debauched events and love affairs of his past in Paris. He tries his hand at inventing perfumes and he creates a garden of poisonous tropical flowers. Illustrating his preference for artifice over nature (a characteristic Decadent theme), Des Esseintes chooses real flowers that apparently imitate artificial ones. In one of the book's most surrealistic episodes, he has gemstones set in the shell of a tortoise. The extra weight on the creature's back causes its death. In another episode, he decides to visit London after reading the novels of Charles Dickens. He dines at an English restaurant in Paris while waiting for his train and is delighted by the resemblance of the people to his notions derived from literature. He then cancels his trip and returns home, convinced that only disillusion would await him if he were to follow through with his plans.\n\nDes Esseintes conducts a survey of French and Latin literature, rejecting the works approved by the mainstream critics of his day. He rejects the academically respectable Latin authors of the \"Golden Age\" such as Virgil and Cicero, preferring later \"Silver Age\" writers such as Petronius (Des Esseintes praises the decadent \"Satyricon\") and Apuleius (\"Metamorphoses\", commonly known as \"The Golden Ass\") as well as works of early Christian literature, whose style was usually dismissed as the \"barbarous\" product of the Dark Ages. Among French authors, he shows nothing but contempt for the Romantics but adores the poetry of Baudelaire.\n\nDes Esseintes cares little for classic French authors like Rabelais, Molière, Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot, preferring the works of Bourdaloue, Bossuet, Nicole, and Pascal. The nineteenth-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, he exclaims, 'alone was in the right' with his philosophy of pessimism, and Des Esseintes connects Schopenhauer's pessimistic outlook with the resignation of \"The Imitation of Christ,\" a fifteenth-century Christian devotional work by Thomas à Kempis. Des Esseintes' library includes authors of the nascent Symbolist movement, including Paul Verlaine, Tristan Corbière and Stéphane Mallarmé, as well as the decadent fiction of the unorthodox Catholic writers Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam and Barbey d'Aurevilly. Among Catholic literature, Des Esseintes expresses attraction for the work of Ernest Hello.\n\nEventually, his late nights and idiosyncratic diet take their toll on his health, requiring him to return to Paris or to forfeit his life. In the last lines of the book, he compares his return to human society to that of a non-believer trying to embrace religion.\n\nHuysmans predicted his novel would be a failure with the public and critics: \"It will be the biggest fiasco of the year—but I don't care a damn! It will be something nobody has ever done before, and I shall have said what I want to say...\" However, when it appeared in May, 1884, the book created a storm of publicity. Though many critics were scandalised, it appealed to a young generation of aesthetes and writers.\n\nRichard Ellmann describes the effect of the book in his biography of Oscar Wilde:Whistler rushed to congratulate Huysmans the next day on his 'marvellous' book. Bourget, at that time a close friend of Huysmans as of Wilde, admired it greatly; Paul Valéry called it his 'Bible and his bedside book' and this is what it became for Wilde. He said to the \"Morning News\": 'This last book of Huysmans is one of the best I have ever seen'. It was being reviewed everywhere as the guidebook of decadence. At the very moment that Wilde was falling in with social patterns, he was confronted with a book which even in its title defied them. \n\nIt is widely believed that \"À rebours\" is the \"poisonous French novel\" that leads to the downfall of Dorian Gray in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\". The book's plot is said to have dominated the action of Dorian, causing him to live an amoral life of sin and hedonism. In Chapter 10, Dorian examines a book sent to him by the hedonistic aristocrat Lord Henry Wotton: It was the strangest book that he had ever read. It seemed to him that in exquisite raiment, and to the delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb show before him ... It was a novel without a plot, and with only one character, being, indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian, who spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his own ... The style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid and obscure at once, full of \"argot\" and of archaisms, of technical expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work of some of the finest artists of the French school of \"Symbolistes\". There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids, and as subtle in colour. The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical philosophy. One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the spiritual ecstasies of some mediaeval saint or the morbid confessions of a modern sinner. It was a poisonous book. The heavy odour of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain. The mere cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated, produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter, a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming ...\"\n\nOn the question of Huysmans' novel as an inspiration for the book in \"Dorian Gray,\" Ellmann writes:Wilde does not name the book but at his trial he conceded that it was, or almost, Huysmans's \"À rebours\"... To a correspondent he wrote that he had played a 'fantastic variation' upon \"À rebours\" and some day must write it down. The references in \"Dorian Gray\" to specific chapters are deliberately inaccurate. \n\nHuysmans's former mentor, Zola, gave the book a lukewarm reception. Huysmans initially tried to placate him by claiming the book was still in the Naturalist style and that Des Esseintes's opinions and tastes were not his own. However, when they met in July, Zola told Huysmans that the book had been a \"terrible blow to Naturalism\" and accused him of \"leading the school astray\" and \"burning [his] boats with such a book\", claiming that \"no type of literature was possible in this genre, exhausted by a single volume\".\n\nWhile he slowly drifted away from the Naturalists, Huysmans won new friends among the Symbolist and Catholic writers whose work he had praised in his novel. Stéphane Mallarmé responded with the tribute \"Prose pour Des Esseintes\", published in \"La Revue indépendante\" on January 1, 1885. This famous poem has been described as \"perhaps the most enigmatic of Mallarmé's works\". The opening stanza gives some of its flavour:\"Hyperbole! de ma mémoire<br>Triomphalement ne sais-tu<br>Te lever, aujourd'hui grimoire<br>Dans un livre de fer vêtu...\"<br><br>Hyperbole! Can't you arise<br>From memory, and triumph, grow<br>Today a form of conjuration<br>Robed in an iron folio?<br>(Translated by Donald Davie) \n\nThe Catholic writer Léon Bloy praised the novel, describing Huysmans as \"formerly a Naturalist, but now an Idealist capable of the most exalted mysticism, and as far removed from the crapulous [gluttonous or drunken] Zola as if all the interplanetary spaces had suddenly accumulated between them.\" In his review, Barbey d'Aurevilly compared Huysmans to Baudelaire, recalling: \"After \"Les Fleurs du mal\" I told Baudelaire it only remains for you to choose between the muzzle of the pistol and the foot of the Cross. But will the author of \"À rebours\" make the same choice?\" His prediction eventually proved true when Huysmans converted to Catholicism in the 1890s.\n\n\n"}

She is best known for her 2000 hit single \"Another Dumb Blonde\" from the soundtrack and film \"Snow Day\" and the song \"Perfect Day\" from the soundtrack and film \"Legally Blonde\".\n\nHoku was born Hoku Christian Ho on June 10, 1981, on the island of Oahu, part of the Hawaiian Islands, the daughter of entertainer Don Ho and Patricia Swallie. Her given name, Hoku, is the Hawaiian word for star. Her father was hapa, of Native Hawaiian, Chinese, Portuguese, German, and Dutch descent. She has one full sibling, a younger sister named Kaimana, and eight half-siblings. For a time, Clements lived in an affluent Hawaiian neighborhood, Diamond Head, with Don, Patricia, Kaimana, Don's ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Guevara, and Don and Elizabeth's two daughters.\n\nHoku frequently performed with her father, who taught her how to write songs, as a child. She was initially unaware of her father's fame, learning from people's reactions after realizing who her father was. \"I thought everyone's parents had shows at night,\" she said. She graduated from La Pietra.\n\nHoku credits her father for her discovery. \"People helped me a lot, because of who my dad was,\" she said. She caught the attention of songwriter and producer Antonina Armato, who encouraged her to move to Los Angeles to meet with other producers. \"She has a pure voice,\" Armato said. \"I don't have to doctor it and use all the tricks of the studio.\" Hoku was attending Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego, dropping her last name when she moved from Hawaii, when she was offered a $300,000 contract from Geffen Records. Armato assisted Hoku in securing the deal, and Ho insisted that he and his lawyers review it before she signed. \"I didn't want her signing something that wasn't good,\" he said.\n\nHoku's debut single, \"Another Dumb Blonde\" (the theme song to the 2000 film \"Snow Day\"), was released on January 18, 2000. A day after its music video premiered on MTV, it was the network's tenth most-requested video. The song was a top ten sales hit in the United States and peaked at number 27 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, additionally charting at number 47 in New Zealand. Shocked by the single's success, Hoku dropped out of Point Loma Nazarene and began recording her first album \"Hoku\" (2000). The album was released on April 18, 2000, by Geffen and Interscope Records and peaked at number 151 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\n\nHoku planned to work on a second album for Interscope after the March 2001 release of her single \"Perfect Day\". Struggling to find a niche in the pop music industry, she left the label, disagreeing with them regarding her image and marketing. She wrote and funded an EP, \"Listen Up\", which was released on August 1, 2008, through the singer's own Ola Vista Records. She opened for Gwen Stefani's Neal S. Blaisdell Center shows of The Sweet Escape Tour later that month. In March 2018, she decided to return to her music and release an EP titled Called by Name. Unlike her previous works, this is her first Christian EP.\n\nJason Lynch of \"People\" has called bubblegum pop Hoku's speciality. Hoku's AllMusic page lists her musical styles as teen pop and Europop. She has been frequently compared to fellow pop singers Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears, however, Charlotte Dillon of AllMusic has noted Hoku's distinct style, attributing it to the singer's Christian faith. \"It's not very comfortable for me to be a sex symbol, especially because of my faith,\" Hoku has said. \"That's why I enjoy being involved with the younger kids, because they relate to me being the girl next door.\" In his review of \"Hoku\", Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, \"Sure, it's commercial – that's what teen pop is all about – but never once do the record makers decide to push Hoku as a nymphet. Her songs are never sexual the way those of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera surely are.\" Erlewine also noted that her young-sounding voice made it appropriate that her music was \"targeted toward middle-school daydreams and junior-high dances\".\n\nHoku became a Christian after first attending church in 1995; she has said that nothing means more to her than music outside of her family and faith. She married her high school sweetheart, Jeremy Clements, in 1999. The couple eloped \"for personal reasons\", according to Hoku, later saying that she was scared to tell her father because of his harsh attitude towards boys she previously dated, and how young she was at the time. Hoku and her husband Jeremy have three children and serve as Arts and Worship Architects at Branches Church in Dana Point, California.\n\n\n"}

The method by which SPs are set for each runner varies in different countries but is generally by consensus of an appointed panel on the basis of their observations of the fluctuation in prices at the racetrack. \n\nThis is done as follows: \n\nFor each horse the odds offered by the bookmakers are ordered into a list from longest to shortest. This list is then divided into two equal halves and the SP is the shortest odds available in the half containing the longest odds. Thus the SP or a longer price will have been offered by at least half the bookmakers in the sample. \n\n\"Note\": This method is slightly different from the method of calculating the median.\n\nThe principal function of a starting price is to determine returns on those winning bets where fixed odds have not been taken at the time the bet was struck.\n\nTypically, on the day of the race, UK bookmakers offer a choice between placing a bet at SP, or taking a fixed price. When viewing future races, SP may be the only option available.\n\nSome bookmakers offer \"best odds guaranteed\", meaning that if a punter takes fixed odds on a race when the bet is struck and the SP turns out to be better (that is, higher), then if the punter wins, the payout is calculated using the SP. This is aimed at removing hesitancy among punters prompted by fears of taking what might prove to be a poor (that is, low) price before the race.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the stake on an SP bet is returned if the horse is withdrawn before the race starts. For fixed-odds (ante-post) bets, the stake is retained by the bookmaker.\n"}

She had been the merchant vessel \"Marquis of Rockingham\", launched in 1770 at Whitby. In naval service she sailed with \"Resolution\" on James Cook's second expedition to the Pacific in 1772–1775. She was the first ship to circumnavigate the globe from west to east. After her return she served as a store ship until 1779. The navy sold her in 1783 and she resumed a civilian career, but retaining the name \"Adventure\". She was lost in May 1811.\n\nShe began her career as the North Sea collier \"Marquis of Rockingham\", launched at Whitby in 1770.\n\nSoon after his return from his first voyage in 1771, Commander Cook was commissioned by the Royal Society of London to make a second voyage in search of a supposed southern continent, Terra Australis Incognita. He arranged for the Navy to purchase two ships, the second and smaller of which was \"Marquis of Rockingham\".\n\nThe Navy purchased her in 1771 and first named her \"Raleigh\" or \"Rayleigh\", and then \"Adventure\". The Navy commissioned her under Joseph Shank.\n\nCook was given the command of \"Resolution\", with Commander Tobias Furneaux accompanying him in \"Adventure\", having replaced Shank. Furneaux was an experienced explorer, having served on Samuel Wallis's circumnavigation in \"Dolphin\" in 1766–1768.\n\n\"Resolution\" and \"Adventure\" left Plymouth on 13 July 1772 and on 17 January 1773 were the first European ships to cross the Antarctic Circle. On 8 February 1773 the two ships became separated in a fog and Furneaux directed \"Adventure\" towards the prearranged meeting point of Queen Charlotte Sound (New Zealand), charted by Cook in 1770.\n\nOn the way to the rendezvous, \"Adventure\" surveyed the southern and eastern coasts of Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's Land), where Adventure Bay was named for the ship. Furneaux made the earliest British chart of this shore, but as he did not enter Bass Strait he assumed Tasmania to be part of Australia. Most of his names here survive; Cook, visiting this shore-line on his third voyage, confirmed Furneaux's account and delineation of it, and named after him the islands in Banks Strait.\n\n\"Adventure\" arrived at Queen Charlotte Sound on 7 May 1773 and \"Resolution\" followed on 17 May. From June to October the two ships explored the southern Pacific, reaching Tahiti on 15 August, where Omai of Ra'iatea embarked on \"Adventure\" (Omai later became the first Pacific Islander to visit Europe before returning to Tahiti with Cook in 1776). After calling at Tonga in the Friendly Islands the ships returned to New Zealand but were separated by a storm on 22 October. This time the rendezvous at Queen Charlotte Sound was missed — \"Resolution\" departed on 26 November, four days before \"Adventure\" arrived. Cook had left a message buried in the sand setting out his plan to explore the South Pacific and return to New Zealand. Furneaux decided to return home and buried a reply to that effect.\n\nBefore he could leave, a fight broke out between \"Adventure's\" crew and the local Māori people, in which ten crewmen and two Māoris were killed. This was reportedly prompted by an unknowing breach of tapu by a sailor, who placed a tin can that had held food on a chief's head. Alternatively, it may have been due to a barter gone wrong at Grass Cove on 17 Dec. 1773, and Kahura taking revenge (\"utu\").\n\"Adventure\" set out for home on 22 December 1773 via Cape Horn, She returned to England on 14 July 1774 and entered the double dock in the Royal Dockyard at Deptford where between March and May 1775 she was converted into a store ship for Halifax, Canada.\n\nLieutenant John Hallum recommissioned \"Adventure\" in March 1775. He sailed for North America on 26 June 1775. In November 1777 Lieutenant Hugh Tolken replaced Hallum at Boston. Between January and March 1779 she underwent refitting at Deptford Dockyard.\nHenry Trubshaw Bell, Coxswain of was appointed as boatswain on 30 August 1779, at Halifax. The log for 5 September 1779 shows that \"this day 8 men deserted the ship. Ditto took two of them again by information and confined them in irons\".\n\n\"Adventure\" set sail from Halifax on 26 October 1779, in company with the ships \"Keppel\", \"Royal Briton\" and \"Dunmore\". She sailed mainly in fresh or hard gales for most of the 36 days it took to reach Spithead, which is situated at the eastern part of the channel between Hampshire, England, and the Isle of Wight at Portsmouth. The voyage was not without its tensions. The log records that on 6 December 1779, the Captain \"punished William Pritt with two dozen lashes for striking the boatswain and carpenter\". \"Adventure\" arrived at Sheerness in December 1779, and was paid off on 13 January 1780. She underwent fitting as a fireship, but was never employed in that role.\n\n\"Adventure\" was laid up at Sheerness until the Navy sold her on 7 May 1783 for £900, apparently to her original owners.\n\n\"Adventure\" did not appear in \"Lloyd's Register\" (\"LR\") until 1800. In 1784 an \"Adventure\", of 350 tons (bm), British-built, entered the register, having undergone a good repair in that year. Her owner was J.Montgomerie, and her trade London-Davis Strait, i.e., she was a whaler. She was last listed in 1794.\n\n\"Adventure\" reappeared in \"Lloyd's Register\" (\"LR\") in 1800 with H.Lisk, master, T.Brown, owner, and trade London transport.\n\nOn 24 May 1811, \"Adventure\", of Whitby, Snowden, master, and sailing between Leith and Quebec, was wrecked in the Saint Lawrence River.

He appears in French romances and \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", and in subsequent modern works based on the Arthurian cycle.\n\nIn Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", Accolon is referred to as Sir Accolon of Gaul. He is the object of desire for Morgan le Fay, King Arthur's half-sister. (As described in Accolon's original story in the Post-Vulgate Cycle that was Malory's source: \"She loved him so madly that she desired to kill her husband and her brother, for she thought she could make Accolon king, either by the devil's help or by magic or by entreaty of the nobles of Great Britain.\")\n\nAt an early stage in Malory's book, Accolon is hunting with Arthur and Urien when they become lost and are forced to camp in the woods. After they came upon and board Morgan's fairy boat, Accolon awakens in a field where Morgan appears and gives him the magic sword Excalibur, which Arthur had earlier entrusted to her, telling him he must use the weapon in his next battle. Accolon's next battle is with a mysterious swordsman who is actually Arthur, wielding a sword he believes to be Excalibur but which was actually a fake given to him by Morgan. Neither man recognises the other but Accolon gains the upper hand due to wielding the real Excalibur. During the battle Arthur's sword broke; he quickly realized this was not the real Excalibur and that he had been betrayed. Rather than giving up, Arthur continued to fight with what was left of his shield. Nimue, the Lady of the Lake, arrived and used her magic to cause Excalibur to fly from Accolon's hand. Arthur then wrestled the scabbard back and dealt Accolon a mortal wound.\n\nWhen Arthur recognised Accolon and learns of Morgan's part in the battle he assures his friend that he would not be punished for the incident. However Accolon dies four days after receiving the battle-wound from Arthur. His body is sent by Arthur to Morgan. Later, Morgan saves Arthur's knight named Manassen (or Manessen) from a certain death and enables him to kill his captor after she learns Accolon was Manassen's cousin.\n\nAccolon also appears in some of modern Arthurian fiction. For instance, the scene of his battle with Arthur is included in Marion Zimmer Bradley's \"The Mists of Avalon\", though with the role of Nimue omitted. In Bradley's interpretation, Morgan and Accolon's aim was to restore the pre-Roman Celtic pagan religion, threatened by the aggressive advent of Christianity; Accolon is the second son of Uriens and a knight loyal to Avalon. He becomes Morgan's lover, and she wants him to kill King Arthur and so restore the power of Avalon, but Arthur slays him in direct combat; when Morgan's role becomes evident, she is disgraced.\n"}

From June to December 2006, he served as Minister for the Environment, one of nine FLP ministers, in the multiparty Cabinet of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. His ministerial career was terminated by the coup d'état that deposed the government on 5 December 2006, but on January 8, 2007, he was appointed as Minister for Public Service and Public Service Reform in the interim Cabinet of Commodore Frank Bainimarama.\n\nPrior to entering politics, Bune was career civil servant who held various senior civil positions including Permanent Secretary to the Public Service Commission before his appointment as Fiji's ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nBune began his political career with the now-defunct Christian Democratic Alliance (VLV), which he helped to found in 1998. He was elected to represent the Macuata Fijian Communal constituency in the House of Representatives on the VLV ticket in 1999, defeating Cabinet Minister Ratu Josefa Dimuri, and was subsequently appointed to the People's Coalition Cabinet by Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry.\n\nIn the wake of the civilian coup d'état which deposed the Chaudhry government in 2000, however, the VLV splintered in the realignment that followed, with various members teaming up with the \"Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei\" (SVT) or the newly formed \"Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua\" (SDL). Bune himself joined the FLP, and in the election held to restore democracy in 2001, he was elected to represent the Labasa Open Constituency on the FLP ticket. In 2004, he was elected Deputy Leader of the FLP, and on 29 July 2005, he was elected a Vice-President of the party, in addition to his position as Deputy Leader.\n\nBune was known for his outspokenness. In June 2005, he called on indigenous Fijians to prepare themselves to accept a non-indigenous Prime Minister, saying that the country was ready for it. On the other hand, he also said that it might be better to go back to being led by chiefs than continuing with leadership by commoners, whom he accused of retarding the country's progress. \"\"I believe we should go back to having chiefs leading the country because two commoners have led the country and they have taken us backward,\"\" Bune said - a reference to Sitiveni Rabuka (Prime Minister 1992-1999 and Laisenia Qarase (Prime Minister since 2000).\n\nBune strongly opposed the government's plans to establish a Commission with the power to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the 2000 coup. He disputed government claims that most indigenous Fijians supported the legislation, claiming that most had never been told any version other than the government's propaganda.\n\nBune had strong reservations about the government's promotion of economic growth on the basis of tourism, investment, and construction. The shift from an agricultural economy would only increase the country's import bills, he claims, as it will cause Fijian landowners to lose interest in farming their land. There were already signs of this happening, he said on 10 August 2005. The fact that milk was being imported was reflective of agricultural land lying dormant. Speaking in Parliament, he said that the government's appeal to potential investors, based on Fiji's high educational standards, widespread fluency in English, a ready labour force, and population of law-abiding systems, did not square with the truth. Muggings, rapes, and robberies, not to mention coups, were prevalent in Fiji, he said. Tourism had had a negative effect on indigenous Fijians, he said, with an increase in sexually related diseases and a breakdown of the traditional family unit. There was too much emphasis on money nowadays, he said, and not enough emphasis on life itself.\n\nOn 28 June 2005, Bune joined his party's eight representatives in the Senate in angrily denying rumours published in a newspaper that a Labour Senator had visited imprisoned Senator Ratu Inoke Takiveikata and promised that a future Labour government would free him if he resigned from the SDL Party. Bune called the report \"\"gutter-level journalism\"\", pointing out that the article provided no names and quoted anonymous sources. \"\"It is an obvious artifice,\"\" Bune said. Takiveikata was serving (and is still serving) a life sentence for his role in assisting an army mutiny at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks on 2 November 2000, an attempt by hardline Fijian nationalists to seize control of the army, then the country. Four loyal soldiers were killed in the mutiny, and after their capture, four of the rebels were beaten to death by loyalists.\n\nPrime Minister Laisenia Qarase branded Bune a \"power-hungry\" Member of Parliament on 10 August 2005. Qarase's attack came after Bune delivered a 52-minute speech in parliament, 32 minutes longer than parliamentary rules normally permitted. Works Minister Savenaca Draunidalo concurred, accusing Bune of having \"bullied\" fellow-FLP parliamentarian Surendra Lal into giving him his time allocation. Qarase announced his intention to lay a complaint about Bune's behaviour with Parliament's business committee.\n\nBune reacted the next day by accusing of the Prime Minister of \"\"exposing his ignorance of the parliamentary process.\"\" The Labour Party had decided, he said, that he should speak on matters sensitive to indigenous Fijians, as he was one of only two ethnic Fijians in the party caucus, and that Lal had agreed to give him 15 minutes of his time allotment. Parliamentary Speaker Ratu Epeli Nailatikau ruled that Bune's speech was in order, and parliamentary Secretary Mary Chapman confirmed that time-sharing within a party was compatible with parliament's rules.\n\nIn late November 2005, Bune clashed in Parliament with Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu, a Cabinet Minister and \"Tui Cakau\" (Paramount Chief of the Tovata Confederacy), accusing Lalabalavu of misleading the House. Lalabalavu, who had been sentenced to eight months' imprisonment for unlawful assembly in connection with the army munity that took place at Sukanaivalu Barracks in Labasa in 2000, claimed in Parliament on 17 November 2005 that he had acted only with a view to preventing bloodshed. Responding in the House on 23 November, Bune rejected his defence, saying that only a bargain between the mutineers and Labasa businessmen had prevented the looting of the town during the mutiny. \"\"Is this the kind of positive influence (he) is speaking of?\"\" Bune demanded, and accused Lalabalavu of trying to rewrite history. He also denied that Lalabalavu had offered a traditional apology, as claimed, to Mahendra Chaudhry. The apology had been offered, he said, only to President Ratu Josefa Iloilo, with Chaudhry invited as a guest. This was why Chaudhry had refused the invitation, Bune said.\n\nBune's attack provoked a sharp reaction from Prime Minister Qarase, who said that his charges against Lalabalavu were false and disrespectful, and showed that he did not think like a Fijian. Lalabalavu himself responded two days later with a strongly worded statement in Parliament, declaring that if Bune was truly from Macuata Province, he would not speak against the people who had tried to diffuse an incident that threatened the lives of Macuata people. He also reiterated his earlier claims that he had offered \"yaqona\" to Chaudhry in late 2004 in a traditional request for forgiveness, but had been refused. He clarified that he had done so because he believed that Chaudhry had been the aggrieved party in the 2000 coup.\n\nIn response to the Prime Minister's charge that he had treated a Paramount Chief with disrespect, Bune told Parliament on 30 November that he had not intended his clash with Lalabalavu to be disrespectful of chiefly authority. He clarified that politicians should differentiate between the \"Vanua\" (traditional hierarchy), the church, and the political realm, and recalled that Paramount Chiefs in the past, who have held parliamentary seats, have recognized that distinction. It was the Opposition's role, he said, to scrutinize government members, but that in no way slighted the chiefs. \"\"When I stand here to talk about issues, events and situations, it does not mean that I do not respect the chiefs and I want to let that be known,\"\" Bune said.\n\nBune was expelled from the FLP on 28 November 2006, the \"Fiji Times\" reported. The expulsion of Bune and four other senior members of the FLP was related to their criticism of the party's failure to nominate Vijay Singh to the Senate, which they claimed was a breach of promise. Bune's expulsion from the party was finalized on 4 December 2006. Under the Fijian constitution, Bune was set to forfeit his Ministerial role and his Parliamentary seat, subject to an appeal. The question was made redundant, however, by the coup d'état that deposed the Qarase government on 5 December 2006, one day after his final expulsion from the Labour Party.\n\nBune called on Qarase and his supporters to accept the regime change and move aside to allow the country to \"move forward.\" The lesson learned from history, he said, was that deposed leaders never return to power.\n"}

He was born in Russia to Baltic German and American parents and spent his working life in France, England and the United States.\n\nBorn in Saint Petersburg, Russia on September 4, 1900, Hoyningen-Huene was the only son of Baron Barthold Theodor Hermann (Theodorevitch) von Hoyningen-Huene (1859-1942), a Baltic nobleman, military officer and lord of Navesti manor (near Võhma), and his wife, Emily Anne \"Nan\" Lothrop (1860-1927), a daughter of George Van Ness Lothrop, an American minister to Russia. (The couple was married in Detroit, Michigan, in 1888.) He had two sisters. Helen (died 1976) became a fashion designer in France and the United States, using the name Helen de Huene. Elizabeth (1891-1973), also known as Betty, also became a fashion designer (using the name Mme. Yteb in the 1920s and 1930s) and married, first, Baron Wrangel, and, second, Lt. Col. Charles Norman Buzzard, a British Army officer.\n\nDuring the Russian Revolution, the Hoyningen-Huenes fled to first London, and later Paris. By 1925 George had already worked his way up to chief of photography of the French Vogue where he was mentor to up-and-coming photographers including François Tuefferd. In 1931 he met Horst, the future photographer, who became his lover and frequent model and traveled to England with him that winter. While there, they visited photographer Cecil Beaton, who was working for the British edition of Vogue. In 1931, Horst began his association with Vogue, publishing his first photograph in the French edition of Vogue in November of that year.\n\nIn 1935 Hoyningen-Huene moved to New York City where he did most of his work for Harper's Bazaar. He published two art books on Greece and Egypt before relocating to Hollywood, where he earned a living by shooting glamorous portraits for the film industry.\n\nHoyningen-Huene worked in huge studios and with whatever lighting worked best. Beyond fashion, he was a master portraitist of Hollywood stars to other celebrities.\n\nHe also worked in Hollywood in various capacities in the film industry, working closely with George Cukor, notably as special visual and color consultant for the 1954 Judy Garland movie \"A Star Is Born\". He served a similar role for the 1957 film \"Les Girls\", which starred Kay Kendall and Mitzi Gaynor, the Sophia Loren film \"Heller in Pink Tights\" and \"The Chapman Report\".\n\nIn 1952 his cousin Baron Ernst Lyssardt von Hoyningen-Huene, whom he had adopted, married Nancy Oakes, the daughter of the gold mining tycoon Sir Harry Oakes.

With a population of 277, it has several thatched houses and a pub called \"The New Inn\". Its post office closed in 1991.\n\nThe parish of Dowlish Wake was part of the South Petherton Hundred.\n\nThe village is situated on Dowlish Brook, which is crossed by a 17th-century packhorse bridge (widened in the 1990s) and a road bridge from the 18th century. There was a flour mill on the brook in the 17th century, but only the Mill House survives today. Until the early 1990s parts of the village were regularly cut off by floodwaters between two fords which cross the main road; however, this has largely been prevented by recent drainage improvements.\n\nThe village was a centre for the manufacture of silk and there are the remains of several limestone quarries. It was on the route of the Chard Canal, which was built around 1835–40 and intended as part of a ship canal between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel, but this was never built.\n\nIn 2004, a stone in a village garden, used by a widow to mark the grave of her pet cat, was identified by the village potter as a 9th-century Anglo-Saxon carving of St Peter.\n\nThe sports pavilion on the Lawrence Kellett Recreation Field was rebuilt in 2007, but then destroyed by arson in October 2016. A designated committee is working to raise funds to rebuild it again.\n\nAs a civil parish, Dowlish Wake has its own parish council responsible for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs, and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The council:\n\n\nThe village is part of the South Somerset local government district within the wider Somerset County Council. It was previously part of the Chard Rural District.\n\nDowlish Wake is part of the county constituency of Yeovil, which covers the towns of Yeovil, Chard, Crewkerne and Ilminster in Somerset. It is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The constituency elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Until 1983, Somerset was split into four constituencies, and Yeovil constituency also included the towns of Ilchester, Martock and Somerton, but they were moved into the newly created constituency of Somerton and Frome. As of the next election, Ilchester will be restored to the Yeovil constituency, to equalise the populations of the Somerset constituencies. The Boundary Commission for England estimate that, subsequent to these boundary changes, Yeovil constituency's electorate will be 77,049. The current MP is David Laws, a member of the Liberal Democrats.\n\nResidents of Dowlish Wake also form part of the electorate for the South West England constituency for elections to the European Parliament, which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nThe village is the home Perry's Cider Mill, manufacturers of several award-winning ciders. It occupies a 16th-century barn that may originally have been used as a smithy. It features a museum, and a cafe that opened in 2008.\n\nThe hamstone Manor House has 11th-century origins, with the present building being from all periods from the 15th century. Known as Dowlish Farm by 1688, it was held by the Wake family from the 12th century. It passed through marriage to the Speke family at the end of the 15th century; they sold it in 1920.\n\nThe Dower House dates from 1664, and was leased to female members of the Speke family in the later 18th century, giving it its name.\n\nThe hamstone Norman Church of St Andrew includes fragments of the chancel dating from the 13th century, and has a tower and aisles added in 1528. Most of it was rebuilt in 1861–62. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building.\n\nSpeke Hall, next to the church, was used, from its erection by William Speke, as the day and Sunday school from 1840 to 1949. It now serves as the village hall, hosting regular social functions.\n\nThe Manor was the home of the family of John Hanning Speke who took part in three expeditions to Central Africa from 1854-1862, the last two in search of the source of the Nile. Speke discovered Lake Victoria and maintained that it was the source of the White Nile. On his third expedition, Speke identified Ripon Falls, the outlet of Lake Victoria, as the source of the Nile; this was confirmed by Henry Morton Stanley in a later expedition. Speke was killed in Neston Park in Wiltshire by his own gun while hunting with his cousin on 18 September 1864; Dr David Livingstone and Sir Roderick Murchison, President of the Royal Geographical Society, attended his funeral. A memorial to Speke, with a lifesize bust, is in the church where he is buried.\n\nMeadowbank was the home of hot air balloonist Gary Mortimer and his family.\n"}
{"id": "2050128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050128", "title": "Bulli railway station", "text": "Bulli railway station\n\nBulli railway station is a heritage-listed railway station on the South Coast railway line in New South Wales, Australia, serving the northern Wollongong suburb of Bulli. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 30 August 2013.\n\nThe name Bulli appears to have been first recorded in the Sydney Gazette of 22 April 1815. In 1823 reference was made to a small land holding at \"Bull Eye\". A 300-acre grant was promised to Cornelius O'Brien on 31 March 1821, whose house was the only one in this part of the district for some years. In 1841 the estate of Bulli, consisting of 900 acres, was offered for private sale and later was subdivided into farms of from 25 to 165 acres. For many years the name Bulli was used for all the country from Wollongong north to Coal Cliff.\n\nThe station opened on 21 June 1887 as part of the then isolated section of the Illawarra Line from Scarborough (Clifton) to Wollongong. The line was duplicated in 1915-1917. Bulli Railway Station was planned as a typical small but complete country station having a standard 3rd class timber station building, unusually also having a detached post office. A Station Master's residence and a goods shed were also constructed in 1887. The 1887 Station Master's cottage (no longer owned by RailCorp) is a good example of the standard structure built during the 1880s. A 5 tonne derrick crane was installed in 1890.\n\nWhen the line was finally connected to Sydney in October 1888, the station's intended potential was realised which was further extended in 1916 with duplication reaching the station and construction of the Park Road overbridge with its steel beams brick abutments and balustrading. The line was then duplicated in 1923 to Woonona, resulting in the construction of the present standard brick platform building on the Up platform, and an out-of-room to the south of the new Platform 1 building. The 1917 plans show an extant \"inspectors office\" (no longer extant) to the north of the 1887 Platform 2 building. In later years the goods shed and cattle yard at the station were closed and the structure demolished.\n\nIn 1984 the Black Diamond Heritage Centre was formed by the Bulli community and they now have a large collection of local history and memorabilia on display in the central section of the 1887 Platform 2 building.\n\nIn 1986 the line was electrified as far as Wollongong.\n\nTo the south of Platform 2, a former South Bulli Colliery steam locomotive and some wagons have been plinthed.\n\nBulli has two side platforms and is serviced by NSW TrainLink South Coast line services travelling from Waterfall and Thirroul to Port Kembla. Some peak hour and late night services operate to Sydney Central, Bondi Junction and Kiama.\n\nThe station precinct includes the Platform 1 building (1923), the out of room (1923), Platform 2 building (1887), Platform 1 (1923) and Platform 2 (1887).\n\nBulli Railway Station is located between Railway Street on the west and Franklin Avenue on the east, with the Park Road overbridge at the northern end of the station being a major access point to the platforms via modern lifts which have been attached to the southern side of the overbridge. The station has two perimeter platforms, each with asphalt surfaces and brick edges. Cream coloured powder coated aluminium fencing defines the station perimeters. There is a car park on the western side of the station (adjacent to the 1923 Platform 1 building), and a curved driveway off Franklin Avenue on the eastern side to access the 1887 Platform 2 building.\n\nA large freestanding face brick platform building with a gabled corrugated steel roof. The building features timber tongue and grooved boarding and simple timber bargeboards to gable ends at north and south ends. There are two brick chimneys to the roof. The building has a skillion corrugated steel roof to a cantilevered awning on the platform (east) elevation, the awning being cantilevered on steel brackets mounted on decorative stucco wall brackets. Windows are timber framed double hung, with 9-pane top sashes with multicoloured glass panes. Window and door openings are defined with decorative stucco surrounds. There are some timber flush doors and steel security doors, some 6-pane fanlights with multicoloured glass panes. There is a weatherboard gabled shelter extension at the northern end of the building to shelter the ticket office area.\n\nThis building was originally planned with a men's toilet, ladies toilet, ladies waiting room, general waiting room, booking office and open booking lobby. The general waiting room has modern floor tiling and a modern security screen door, however retains an original ripple iron ceiling with a metal ceiling rose, and a chimney breast, though the fireplace has been blocked up, and original high moulded timber skirting boards.\n\nA small freestanding single storey brick lamp room located at the southern end of Platform 1. The building is face brick, with a gabled Colorbond roof, exposed timber rafter ends to eaves, and simple timber barge boards to the north and south gable ends. The gable ends each have rectangular timber louvred vents. The building has timber tongue and grooved boarded double doors opening on to the platform, with a fanlight above. There is a concrete lintel above the doorway.\n\nThis is a single storey gabled weatherboard platform building with weatherboard extensions at both north and south ends. The building has a corrugated steel gabled roof with 2 painted brick chimneys. The gable ends feature decorative timber bargeboards, pendants and finials, and pairs of rectangular timber louvred vents. On the west (platform) elevation, there is a skillion corrugated steel roofed awning supported on timber stop chamfered posts setback from the platform edge. This awning extends along the southern half of the original gabled section of the platform building. The awning has decorative timber valances to both north and south ends. There are some 2 panel double doors with glazing panels to top, 8-paned fanlights, and timber framed double hung windows. The extension at the southern end is a simple skillion roofed weatherboard room. The extensions at the northern end are a gabled weatherboard room with the gable end transverse to the main ridge of the building's roof. The gable ends to this extension feature timber bargeboards, pendants and finials matching those of the original section of the building. To the north of this extension is a further simple weatherboard skillion roofed room, which is the men's toilets. The main public entrance to the building was formerly from the street through a central passage with large timber panelled double doors at either side. This doorway is covered by a porch on the eastern elevation with bull nose corrugated iron roofs and cast iron lace frieze. The matching door to the platform is sheltered by the platform awning. Interior: Not accessed 2009. 1916 plans for alterations show the interior plan as an office; a combined parcels & Out-of-room; a signal box (converted from a parcels room), a central booking office, a general waiting room, with porch and verandas; gents and ladies toilets. The building still had a central booking office with staff and passenger facilities on either side in 2004.\n\nTwo perimeter platforms, each with asphalt surfaces and brick edges.\n\nThere is a tree-planted island park along Franklin Street east of the Platform 2 building, which enhances its setting. There is a circular drive around the island park to access the Platform 2 building, which appears to be an early feature of the station's landscape setting.\n\nSignificant moveable items include the 1923 waiting room and ticket office signs attached to Platform 1 building and timber luggage trolley. There are also a number of timber station signs on timber posts and station seats on the platform.\n\nThe following items were confirmed to be extant in 2012 by the Black Diamond Heritage Centre: 20 lever signal frame, interlocking signal frame, electrical repeaters, eyeball instrument, 4 x block instruments, next train/platform indicator, Bulli Lamp (Kerosene), Ptc small lamp, wooden ticket sales box, safe\n2 wheeled trolley, 2 x 4 wheeled luggage trolleys, timber ambulance box no.420/D, miscellaneous records of Bulli Railway Station, timber boxes relating to telecommunications, standard clip for T rails, fog signal flags and containers, ticket / dated punch, collection of fettlers tools, flat top fettlers, trolley and wheels, tall writing desk, 3 x Timber tables, 2 x Small timber cupboards, timber service counter, stretcher, Bulli Sidings Diagram, enamelled small Bulli platform sign, Timber Pigeon hole storage, set of 4 kerosene drums made into draws\n\n\nThe Platform 1 Building and Platforms were reported to be in good condition as at 17 October 2012. The Platform 2 building was assessed as being in moderate condition, as was the moveable items collection, with timber station signs having been damaged.\n\nThe station has a high level of integrity.\n\n\nBulli Railway Station is significant for its rare 1887 station building surviving from the first period of construction of the Illawarra line. The 1887 station building is one of the most intact of only four remaining examples of an 1880s third-class weatherboard station building along the Illawarra line, and remains as a tangible reminder of the role of Bulli Station as a transport hub for the village of Bulli since 1887. The 1923 station building and lamp room demonstrate the expansion of railway activity at Bulli into the early 20th century associated with duplication of the line during the 1920s. The juxtaposition of the 1887 and 1923 platform buildings demonstrate the evolution of railway station architecture during this period, and are both excellent examples of their periods and style. The site has special associations with the staff and volunteers of the Black Diamond District Heritage Centre, located in the central section of the 1887 station building, who continue to be instrumental in the ongoing preservation and interpretation of the site.\n\nBulli railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 30 August 2013 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nBulli Railway Station is of historical significance for its 1887 Platform 2 building surviving from the first period of construction of the Illawarra line, and for its 1923 Platform 1 building and out of room, which demonstrate the duplication of the line at this time. Bulli Railway Station is also of historical significance for its role as a transport hub for the village of Bulli since 1887, and demonstrates expansion of the railway station into the early 20th century.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nBulli Railway Station is of aesthetic significance for its 1887 and 1923 platform buildings, which demonstrate changing railway station architecture over this period. The 1887 Platform 2 building at Bulli is one of the best examples of an 1880s weatherboard third class station building surviving on the Illawarra line (other examples at Albion Park, Dapto and Thirroul). The 1923 brick platform building is a good representative example of a Federation period railway station building, of a type and construction material which is common on the Illawarra line.\n\nThe place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nThe presence of the Black Diamond District Heritage Centre occupying the central section of the 1887 Platform 2 building indicates that the place has a specific social significance for the local community.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThe 1887 Platform 2 building at Bulli is one of the best examples of an 1887 weatherboard third class platform building surviving on the Illawarra line, and one of the few buildings extant from the 1887 period of the lines' construction, with most others being replaced in 1915 for the duplication of the line. The Bulli Platform 2 building is one of only four extant 1887 weatherboard 3rd class platform buildings remaining on the Illawarra line, the others being at Albion Park Rail, Dapto and Thirroul. With the platform building at Albion Park Rail, the Bulli Platform 2 building is one of the two most intact extant platform buildings of this type.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\n\nThe 1887 and 1923 platform buildings and Out-of-room represent standard design railway station architecture of their respective periods of construction. Bulli, with its 1887 weatherboard third class platform building, is one of only 4 stations on the Illawarra line with examples of weatherboard versions of this type of platform building (other examples at Albion Park, Dapto and Thirroul).\n\n"}

{"id": "2050142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050142", "title": "Spanish Texas", "text": "Spanish Texas\n\nSpanish Texas was one of the interior provinces of the Spanish colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain from 1690 until 1821.\n\nSpain had claimed ownership of the territory in 1519, which comprised part of the present-day U.S. state of Texas, including the land north of the Medina and Nueces Rivers, but did not attempt to colonize the area until after locating evidence of the failed French colony of Fort Saint Louis in 1689. In 1690 Alonso de León escorted several Catholic missionaries to east Texas, where they established the first mission in Texas. When native tribes resisted the Spanish invasion of their homeland, the missionaries returned to Mexico, abandoning Texas for the next two decades.\nThe Spanish returned to southeastern Texas in 1716, establishing several missions and a presidio to maintain a buffer between Spanish territory and the French colonial Louisiana district of New France. Two years later in 1718, the first civilian settlement in Texas, San Antonio, originated as a way station between the missions and the next-nearest existing settlement. The new town soon became a target for raids by the Lipan Apache.\n\nThe raids continued periodically for almost three decades, until Spanish settlers and the Lipan Apache peoples made peace in 1749. But the treaty angered the enemies of the Apache, and resulted in raids on Spanish settlements by the Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai tribes. Fear of Indian attacks and the remoteness of the area from the rest of the Viceroyalty discouraged European settlers from moving to Texas. It remained one of the provinces least-populated by immigrants. The threat of attacks did not decrease until 1785, when Spain and the Comanche peoples made a peace agreement. The Comanche tribe later assisted in defeating the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes, who had continued to cause difficulties for settlers. An increase in the number of missions in the province allowed for peaceful Indian reductions of other tribes, and by the end of the 18th century only a few of the nomadic hunting and gathering tribes in the area had not converted to Roman Catholicism.\n\nFrance formally relinquished its claim to its region of Texas in 1762, when it ceded French Louisiana to the Spanish Empire. The inclusion of Spanish Louisiana into New Spain meant that Tejas lost its significance as essentially a buffer province. The easternmost Texas settlements were disbanded, with the population relocating to San Antonio. However, in 1799 Spain gave Louisiana back to France, and in 1803 Napoléon Bonaparte (First Consul of the French Republic) sold the territory to the United States of America as part of the Louisiana Purchase, U.S. President Thomas Jefferson (in office: 1801-1809) insisted that the purchase included all land to the east of the Rocky Mountains and to the north of the Rio Grande, although its large southwestern expanse lay within New Spain. The territorial ambiguity remained unresolved until the Adams–Onís Treaty compromise in 1819, when Spain ceded Spanish Florida to the United States in return for recognition of the Sabine River as the eastern boundary of Spanish Texas and western boundary of the Missouri Territory. The United States relinquished their claims on the vast Spanish territories west of the Sabine River and extending into Santa Fe de Nuevo México province (New Mexico).\n\nDuring the Mexican War of Independence of 1810 to 1821 Texas experienced much turmoil. Rebels overthrew the Spanish Governor Manuel María de Salcedo in 1810, but he persuaded his jailer to release him and to assist him in organizing a counter-coup. Three years later the Republican Army of the North, consisting primarily of Indians and of citizens of the United States, overthrew the Spanish government in Tejas and executed Salcedo. The Spanish responded brutally, and by 1820 fewer than 2000 Hispanic citizens remained in Texas. The Mexican independence movement forced Spain to relinquish its control of New Spain in 1821, with Texas becoming in 1824 part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas within the newly-formed Mexico in the period in Texas history known as Mexican Texas (1821-1836).\n\nThe Spanish left a deep mark on Texas. Their European livestock caused mesquite to spread inland, while farmers tilled and irrigated the land, changing the landscape forever. The Spanish language provided the names for many of the rivers, towns, and counties that currently exist, and Spanish architectural concepts still flourish . Although Texas eventually adopted much of the Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal practices survived, including the concepts of a homestead exemption and of community property.\n\nSpanish Texas (\"Tejas\") was a colonial province within the northeastern mainland region of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. On its southern edge, \"Tejas\" was bordered by the province of Coahuila. The boundary between the provinces was set at the line formed by the Medina River and the Nueces River, northeast of the Rio Grande. On the east, Texas bordered \"La Louisiane\" (French Louisiana). Although Spain claimed that the Red River formed the boundary between the two, France insisted that the border was the Sabine River, to the west. After Mexican independence from Spain, it was within Coahuila y Tejas from 1824 to 1835.\n\nAlthough Alonso Álvarez de Pineda claimed Texas for Spain in 1519, the area was largely ignored by Spain until the late seventeenth century. In 1685, the Spanish learned that France had established a colony in the area between New Spain and Florida. Believing the French colony was a threat to Spanish mines and shipping routes, Spanish King Carlos II's Council of War recommended that \"Spain needed swift action 'to remove this thorn which has been thrust into the heart of America. The greater the delay the greater the difficulty of attainment.'\" Having no idea where to find the French colony, the Spanish launched ten expeditions—both land and sea—over the next three years. While unable to fulfill their original goal of locating the French settlement, the expeditions did provide Spain a deeper understanding of the geography of the Gulf Coast region. The last expedition, in 1689, discovered a French deserter living in southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. In April 1689, the Frenchman helped guide the Spanish, under Alonso de León, to Fort Saint Louis, which had been destroyed by Karankawa Indians. De León's expedition also met representatives of the Caddo people, who lived between the Trinity and the Red Rivers. The Caddo expressed interest in learning about Christianity.\n\nDe León sent a report of his findings to Mexico City, where it \"created instant optimism and quickened religious fervor\". The Spanish government was convinced that the destruction of the French fort was \"proof of God's 'divine aid and favor'\". In his report de León recommended that presidios be established along the Rio Grande, the Frio River, and the Guadalupe River and that missions be established among the Hasinai Indians, whom the Spanish called the \"Tejas\", in East Texas. In Castilian Spanish, this was often written as the phonetic equivalent \"Texas\", which became the name of the future province.\n\nThe viceroy approved the establishment of a mission but rejected the idea of presidios, primarily because New Spain was chronically short of funds. On March 26, 1690, Alonso de León set out with 110 soldiers and several missionaries. The group stopped first to burn Fort Saint Louis to the ground, and then they proceeded to East Texas. Mission San Francisco de los Tejas was completed near the Hasinai village of Nabedaches in late May, and its first mass was conducted on June 1. The missionaries refused to allow the unruly soldiers to remain near the missions, and when de León returned to Mexico later that year, only 3 of his initial 110 soldiers remained to assist the monks. Father Damián Massanet, the priest in charge of the mission, left on June 2 to meet the tribes north of the mission before returning to Mexico to request an additional 14 priests and 7 lay brothers.\n\nOn January 23, 1691, Spain appointed the first governor of Texas, General Domingo Terán de los Ríos. Terán was ordered to help establish seven new missions, including two more among the Tejas Indians, four amongst the Kadohadachos, and one for the tribes near the Guadalupe River. He was only able to recruit 10 friars and 3 lay brothers. His expedition reached the existing mission in August, 1691 and discovered that the priests there had established a second mission, Santísimo Nombre de María, east of San Francisco de los Tejas. One of the priests had died, leaving two to operate the missions. The Indians regularly stole their cattle and horses and were becoming insolent. With provisions running low, Terán chose not to establish any more missions. When he left Texas later that year, most of the missionaries chose to return with him, leaving only 3 religious people and 9 soldiers at the missions.\n\nThe group also left a smallpox epidemic. The Indians had no natural immunity to the disease and at first blamed the outbreak on the baptismal waters. After thousands of natives had succumbed, the survivors rose up against the missions. In 1693, the Caddo warned the Franciscan missionaries to leave the area or be killed. The missionaries buried the church bells and burned the mission, then returned to Mexico. Although this first Spanish attempt to settle Texas failed, it provided Spain an increased awareness of the terrain, rivers, and coastline of Texas and convinced the government that \"even the most tractable of Indians\" could only be converted \"by a combination of coercion and persuasion\". For the next 20 years, Spain again ignored Texas.\n\nDuring the early eighteenth century France again provided the impetus for Spain's interest in Texas. In 1699, French forts were established at Biloxi Bay and on the Mississippi River, ending Spain's exclusive control of the Gulf Coast. Although Spain \"refused to concede France's right to be in Louisiana\" and warned King Louis XIV of France that he could be excommunicated for ignoring the 200-year-old papal edict giving the Americas to Spain, they took no further actions to stop France's encroachment or expand the Spanish presence. The two countries became allies during the War of the Spanish Succession and cooperated in the Americas. Despite their friendship, Spain remained unwilling to allow the French to trade within their territory. On hearing rumors of French incursions into Texas in 1707, the viceroy of New Spain ordered all provincial governors to prevent the entry of foreigners and their goods. To dissuade the Tejas Indians from accepting goods from the French, a contingent of soldiers under Pedro de Aguirre traveled into Texas. His expedition reached only as far as the Colorado River and turned around after learning that the Tejas chief was still unhappy with the Spanish. The group did visit the area around the San Antonio River, and was much impressed with the land and availability of water. They believed the river to be unnamed and called it San Antonio de Padua, not realizing that Terán and Massanet had camped nearby years before on the feast day of Saint Anthony of Padua and had given the river the same name.\n\nIn 1711, Franciscan missionary Francisco Hidalgo, who had served in the earlier Texas missions, wanted to reestablish missions with the Caddos. The Spanish government was unwilling to provide the funding and troops for the project, so Hidalgo approached the French governor of Louisiana, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac for help. Cadillac was under orders to turn Louisiana into a profitable colony and believed that Spanish settlers closer to Louisiana could provide new trading opportunities. He sent Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, along with brothers Pierre and Robert Talon, who, as children, had been spared at the massacre of Fort Saint Louis, to find Hidalgo and offer assistance. In July 1714, the French delegation reached the Spanish frontier, at that time around the Rio Grande, where Hidalgo was located. Although St. Denis was arrested and questioned, he was ultimately released. The Spanish recognized that the French could become a threat to other Spanish areas, and ordered the reoccupation of Texas as a buffer between French settlements in Louisiana and New Spain.\n\nOn April 12, 1716, an expedition led by Domingo Ramón left San Juan Bautista for Texas, intending to establish four missions and a presidio which would be guarded by twenty-five soldiers. The party of 75 people included 3 children, 7 women, 18 soldiers, and 10 missionaries. These were the first recorded female settlers in Spanish Texas. After marrying a Spanish woman, St. Denis also joined the Spanish expedition.\n\nThe party reached the land of the Hasinai people in late June 1716 and was greeted warmly. On July 3, mission San Francisco was reestablished as Mission Nuestro Padre San Francisco de los Tejas for the Neche Indians. Several days later, Mission Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción was established at the main village of the Hainai, the head tribe of the Hasinai Confederacy, along the Angelina River. A third mission, Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, was established east of Purísima Concepción, at the main village of the Nacogdoche tribe, at what is now Nacogdoches. A final mission, San José de los Nazonis, was built among the Nazoni Indians just north of present-day Cushing. A presidio, Nuestra Señora de los Dolores, was built opposite San Francisco de los Tejas.\n\nDuring this period, the area was named \"New Philippines\" by the missionaries in the twin hopes of gaining royal patronage, and that the Spanish efforts would be as successful as in the Philippines a century and a half earlier. The alternate name persisted in use for about 40 years, but had virtually disappeared from use (in favor of 'Texas') by the end of the century. The name however persisted in documents, especially in land grants \nAt the same time, the French were building a fort in Natchitoches to establish a more westward presence. The Spanish countered by founding two more missions just west of Natchitoches, San Miguel de los Adaes and Dolores de los Ais. The missions were located in a disputed area; France claimed the Sabine River to be the western boundary of Louisiana, while Spain claimed the Red River was the eastern boundary of Texas, leaving an overlap of .\n\nThe new missions were over from the nearest Spanish settlement, San Juan Bautista. It was difficult to reprovision the missions, and by 1718 the missionaries were in dire straits. Martín de Alarcón, who had been appointed governor of Texas in late 1716, wished to establish a way station between the settlements along the Rio Grande and the new missions in East Texas. The Coahuiltecans had built a thriving community near the headwaters of the San Antonio River, in the area the Spanish had admired in 1707. Alarcón led a group of 72 people, including 10 families, into Texas on April 9, 1718. They brought with them 548 horses, 6 droves of mules, and other livestock. On May 1, the group created a temporary mud, brush and straw structure to serve as a mission, San Antonio de Valero, whose chapel was later known as the Alamo. The mission was initially populated with three to five Indians that one of the missionaries had raised since childhood. Alarcon built a presidio, San Antonio de Béxar north of the mission. Alarcón also chartered the municipality of Béjar, now San Antonio. Given a status higher than a village (\"pueblo\") but lower than a city (\"ciudad\"), San Antonio became the only \"villa\" in Texas, and the colonists who settled there relied on farming and ranching to survive. With the new settlement established, Alarcón continued on to the East Texas missions, where he found evidence of much illicit trade with France.\n\nThe following year, the War of the Quadruple Alliance broke out, aligning Spain against France, England, the Dutch Republic, and Austria. The war was fought primarily over Italy, but England and France used the war as an excuse to attempt to take over Spanish interests in North America. In June 1719, 7 Frenchmen from Natchitoches took control of Mission San Miguel de los Adaes from its sole defender, who did not know that the countries were at war. The French soldiers explained that 100 additional soldiers were coming, and the Spanish colonists, missionaries, and remaining soldiers abandoned the area and fled to San Antonio.\n\nThe Marquis of San Miguel de Aguayo volunteered to reconquer Texas and raised an army of 500 soldiers. Aguayo was named the governor of Coahuila and Texas and the responsibilities of his office delayed his trip to Texas by a year, until late 1720. Just before he departed, the fighting in Europe halted, and King Felipe V of Spain ordered them not to invade Louisiana, but instead find a way to retake Eastern Texas without using force. The expedition brought with them over 2,800 horses, 6,400 sheep and many goats; this constituted the first large \"cattle\" drive in Texas. This greatly increased the number of domesticated animals in Texas and marked the beginning of Spanish ranching in Texas.\n\nIn July 1721, while approaching the Neches River, Aguayo's expedition met St. Denis, who had returned to the French and was leading a raid on San Antonio. Realizing that he was badly outnumbered, St. Denis agreed to abandon East Texas and return to Louisiana. Aguayo then ordered the building of a new Spanish fort Nuestra Señora del Pilar de los Adaes, located near present-day Robeline, Louisiana, only from Natchitoches. The new fort became the first capital of Texas, and was guarded by 6 cannon and 100 soldiers. The six East Texas missions were reopened, and Presidio Dolores, now known as Presidio de los Tejas, was moved from the Neches River to a site near mission Purísima Concepción near the Angelina River. The Spaniards then built another fort, Presidio La Bahía del Espíritu Santo, known as La Bahía, on the site of the former French Fort St. Louis. Nearby they established a mission, Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga (also known as La Bahía), for the Coco, Karankawa, and Cujane Indians. Ninety men were left at the garrison. Aguayo returned to Mexico City in 1722 and resigned his governorship. At the beginning of his expedition, Texas had consisted only of San Antonio and about 60 soldiers; at his resignation, the province had grown to consist of 4 presidios, over 250 soldiers, 10 missions, and the small civilian town of San Antonio.\n\nShortly after Aguayo returned to Mexico, the new viceroy of New Spain, Juan de Acuña, marqués de Casafuerte, was ordered to cut costs accrued for the defense of the northern part of the territory. Acuña appointed Colonel Pedro de Rivera y Villalón to inspect the entire northern frontier. Beginning in what is now California in November 1724, Rivera spent the next three years inspecting the northern frontier, reaching San Antonio in August 1727. His reports of Los Adaes, Presidio Nuestra Señora de Loreto, and the presidio at San Antonio were favorable, but he was unimpressed with Presidio de los Tejas, whose 25 soldiers were guarding empty missions. The native population had refused to congregate into communities around the missions and refused baptism unless they were on the brink of death. Because the Indians were well-armed, the Franciscans were unable to compel them to join the missions. The frustrated missionaries finally petitioned the Spanish government for 50 soldiers to burn the Indians' houses of worship and force them to build homes near the missions. No troops were forthcoming.\n\nRivera recommended closing Presidio de los Tejas and reducing the number of soldiers at the other presidios. His suggestions were approved in 1729, and 125 troops were removed from Texas, leaving only 144 soldiers divided between Los Adaes, La Bahía, and San Antonio. The three East Texas missions which had depended on Presidio de los Tejas were relocated along the San Antonio River in May 1731, increasing the number of missions in the San Antonio area to five. The San Antonio missions usually contained fewer than 300 Indians. Many of those who lived at the mission had nowhere else to go, and belonged to small tribes that have since become extinct.\n\nSpain discouraged manufacturing in its colonies and limited trade to Spanish goods handled by Spanish merchants and carried on Spanish vessels. Most of the ports, including all of those in Texas, were closed to commercial vessels in the hopes of dissuading smugglers. By law, all goods bound for Texas had to be shipped to Veracruz and then transported over the mountains to Mexico City before being sent to Texas. This caused the goods to be very expensive in the Texas settlements. Settlers were often forced to turn to the French for supplies, as the fort at Natchitoches was well-stocked and goods did not have to travel as far. Without many goods to trade, however, the remaining Spanish missionaries and colonists had little to offer the Indians, who remained loyal to the French traders.\n\nThe tribes traded freely, and soon many had acquired French guns, while others had traded for Spanish horses. Tribes without access to either resource were left at a disadvantage. The Lipan Apache, who had been seasonal farmers, were soon pressed by the Comanche, who had horses, and the Wichita, who had guns. The Apaches were bitter enemies of the Tejas of East Texas and had transferred their enmity to the Spanish as friends of the Tejas. After discovering San Antonio in 1720, the Apache began repeatedly raiding the area to steal livestock, especially horses. An average of 3 Spaniards died each year in Texas as a result of Apache attacks, with approximately 100 animals taken each year. In retaliation, the Spanish launched multiple attacks on the Apaches, capturing horses and mules, hides and other plunder, and taking Apache captives, whom the Spanish used as household servants. By 1731, however, the San Antonio garrison was begging the government for help in negotiating a peace with the tribes.\n\nThe Spanish government believed that settlers would defend their property, alleviating the need for some of the presidios. Texas was an unappealing prospect for most settlers, however, due to the armed nomadic tribes, high costs, and lack of precious metals. In 1731, the Spanish government resettled \n55 people, mostly women and children, from the Canary Islands to San Antonio. At that time, only 300 Hispanic settlers lived in San Antonio, with 200 others dispersed throughout the rest of the colony. The new immigrants began farming and renamed the town San Fernando de Béxar, establishing the first municipal, and only civilian, government in Texas. Juan Leal Goraz, the oldest of the settlers, was appointed the first councilman.\n\nAs the first settlers of the municipality, the Islanders and their descendants were designated hidalgos. The established settlers resented the Islanders for their new titles and exclusive privileges within the city government. The newcomers did not know how to handle horses, rendering them useless in mounted warfare against the Apaches. Unlike the established settlers, who relied on ranching, the Islanders were primarily farmers, and their refusal to build fences led to many disagreements when livestock trampled the fields. By the early 1740s, however, intermarriage and the need for closer economic ties had helped to alleviate some of the infighting, and the original settlers were given permission to serve as magistrates and council members.\n\nThe threat of Apache raids led to a constant state of unease in San Antonio, and some families left the area, while others refused to leave the safety of the town to tend their livestock. The problems culminated with a late-night raid on San Antonio by 350 Apache on June 30, 1745, retaliation for a Spanish military campaign several months before. The attackers were repelled with the assistance of 100 Indians from Mission Valero. The Apache also preyed on other tribes, including the Deadose and Tonkawa. In the 1740s, these weaker tribes requested missions along the San Gabriel River in the hopes that the Spanish could protect them from attack. Mission San Francisco Xavier was established at the confluence of the San Gabriel River and Bushy Creek in January 1746 to serve the Deadose, Mayeye, and Coco Indians. In 1748 alone, the Apaches raided the mission four times, killing three soldiers and four of the Indian residents. Many of the resident Indians fled the mission due to the threat of attacks. This did not deter the missionaries, who founded two more missions, San Ildefonso and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, in the area the following year. Within six months, all of the potential converts at San Ildefonso had left. By 1755, the missions were transferred to a new location on the San Marcos River.\n\nA peace was finally declared in August 1749, when a group of Apache chiefs and Spanish officials \"symbolically [buried] the trouble between the two parties\" by burying weapons in the plaza at San Antonio. The Spanish also promised to provide military assistance to the Apache. The Lipan Apache had asked for missions several times, and in 1757 all property of the former San Gabriel missions, as well as the military garrison which briefly protected them, was transferred to new Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá along the San Saba River northwest of San Antonio. A log stockade was constructed from the mission, on the other side of the river, so that the soldiers would not corrupt the Indians. The stockade could hold up to 400 including the 237 women and children who accompanied the soldiers.\n\nApaches shunned the mission, and on March 16, 1758, a band of Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai tribes, angry that the Spaniards were assisting their enemies, pillaged and burned the mission, killing eight people. The San Sabá mission was the only Spanish mission in Texas to be completely destroyed by Indians, and it was never rebuilt. Although the Indian force had 2000 members, they chose not to attack the fort.\n\nThe Spanish government refused to abandon the area completely out of fear that such an action would make them appear weak. While they planned a response, Indians raided the San Saba horse herd, stealing all of the horses and pack mules and killing 20 soldiers. In October 1759, Spain sent the San Sabá commander, Colonel Diego Ortiz Parrilla, on an expedition north to the Red River to avenge the attack. The tribes were forewarned and led Parrilla's army to a fortified Wichita village, surrounded by a stockade and a moat, where natives brandished French guns and waved a French flag. After a skirmish in which 52 Spaniards were killed, wounded, or deserted, the Spanish retreated. The San Sabá presidio was replaced with a limestone fortress and a moat, but the Comanches and their allies remained close and killed any soldiers who ventured out. By 1769, Spain abandoned the fort.\n\nIn 1762, missionaries established two unauthorized missions south of San Sabá, in the Nueces River valley. For several years the Apache lived in the missions most of the year, but left in winter to hunt buffalo. One of the missions closed in 1763, when the Apache never returned from their hunt. The surviving mission closed in January 1766, after a force of 400 natives from the northern tribes attacked, killing 6 Apaches and taking 25 captives as well as all the livestock in the valley. Forty-one Spanish troops and their small cannon ambushed the northern tribes as they returned to East Texas. Before the Spanish were forced to retreat, over 200 Indians and 12 Spanish soldiers died. After the battle, the Apache refused to return to the mission and returned to raiding near San Antonio. Raids by the northern tribes decreased, however.\n\nIndians confirmed in 1746 that French traders periodically arrived by sea to trade with tribes in the lower Trinity River region. Eight years later, the Spanish learned of rumors that the French had opened a trading post at the mouth of the Trinity River. In September 1754, the governor, Jacinto de Barrios y Jáuregui sent soldiers to investigate, and they captured five Frenchmen who had been living at an Indian village. To dissuade the French from returning, Spain built the presidio of San Agustín de Ahumada and the mission of Nuestra Señora de la Luz de Orcoquisac near the mouth of the Trinity at Galveston Bay. Conditions were awful at the new location, and both the presidio and the mission were closed in 1770.\n\nThe Presidio La Bahía was moved from the Guadalupe River to Goliad on the San Antonio River in 1749. Within five years, a new mission for the Karankawa tribes, Nuestra Señora del Rosario de los Cuhanes, was built upstream of the presidio. This mission survived for many years. Despite the new missions and presidios, Texas was one of the least populated provinces on the northern frontier of New Spain. By 1760, almost 1,200 Hispanic people lived in Texas, with half in San Antonio, 350 at Los Adaes, and 260 at La Bahía. Other Spaniards lived in what is now the El Paso area, but that was considered part of New Mexico and not part of Texas.\n\nOn November 3, 1762, as part of the Treaty of Fontainebleau, France ceded the portion of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River to Spain. Spain had assisted France against Britain in the Seven Years' War, and lost both Manila and Havana to the British. Although the Louisiana colony was a financial liability, King Carlos III of Spain reluctantly accepted it, as that meant France was finally ceding its claim to Texas. At the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763, Great Britain recognized Spain's right to the lands west of the Mississippi. Great Britain received the remainder of France's North American territories, and Spain exchanged some of their holdings in Florida for Havana.\n\nWith France no longer a threat to Spain's North American interests, the Spanish monarchy commissioned the Marquis of Rubí to inspect all of the presidios on the northern frontier of New Spain and make recommendations for the future. Rubí's two-year journey, beginning in early 1766, covered from the Gulf of California to East Texas. This was the first comprehensive look at the New Spain frontier since the 1720s, when Pedro de Rivera conducted his expedition. Rubí was unimpressed with the presidio at San Saba, which he declared to be the worst in the kingdom of New Spain. He recommended that only the presidios at San Antonio and La Bahía be maintained, and that East Texas be totally abandoned, with all population moving to San Antonio. With Louisiana in Spanish control, there was no need for Los Adaes to reside so closely to Natchitoches, especially after the missions had relocated to San Antonio. In August 1768, the acting governor, Juan María Vicencio, Baron of Ripperdà, moved his headquarters and the garrison to San Antonio, and in 1772 San Antonio became the new Texas capital. Los Adaes was abandoned completely. The new governor also augmented the garrison at San Antonio to protect the town from recurring Indian attacks. A new presidio, Fuerte de Santa Cruz de Cibolo, was also established southeast of San Antonio to protect farmers and ranchers from attacks.\n\nAs a result of Rubí's recommendations, Presidio de San Agustín de Ahumada was closed in 1771, leaving the Texas coast unoccupied except for La Bahía. In July 1772, however, the governor of Texas heard rumors that English traders were building a settlement in the area of the Texas coast that had been abandoned. The commander of La Bahía was sent to find the settlement, but saw no sign of other Europeans. His expedition did, however, discover that the San Jacinto River emptied into Galveston Bay and not into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe 500 Hispanic settlers who had lived near Los Adaes had to resettle in San Antonio in 1773. In the six years between the inspection and the removal of the settlers, the immigrant population of East Texas had increased from 200 Europeans to 500, a mixture of Spanish, French, Indians, and a few blacks. The settlers were given only five days to prepare to relocate to San Antonio. Many of them perished during the three-month trek and others died soon after arriving.\n\nAfter protesting, they were permitted in the following year to return to East Texas, but only as far as the Trinity River, from Natchitoches. Led by Antonio Gil Y'Barbo, the settlers founded the town of Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Bucareli \"where the trail from San Antonio to Los Adaes crossed the Trinity.\" The settlers helped smuggle contraband goods from Louisiana to San Antonio, and also helped the soldiers with coastal reconnaissance.\n\nIn May 1776, King Carlos III created a new position, the Comandancia General of the Commandancy General of the Internal Provinces of the North (\"Provincias Internas \"), to control frontier areas across northern New Spain, including Spanish Texas. The first appointee, Teodoro de Croix, served as governor and commander in chief of the area from 1776 until 1783. As de Croix prepared to take office, his predecessor, Baron of Ripperdà, wrote a detailed report, dated April 27, 1777, of the settlements in Texas. One-third of the report detailed the village of Bucareli, which he labeled as \"'of the greatest importance as a means of acquiring reports of a coast as extensive as it is uninhabited.'\" The Bucareli settlers regularly performed coastal explorations and developed a friendship with the Bidai tribe, who reported any signs of foreigners along the coast. In the summer of 1777, Gil Ybarbo discovered that a group of Englishmen had come from the sea and stayed long enough to plant a crop near the Neches River. He led an expedition to find the Englishmen, but, although they discovered the fields, the expedition did not find any of the settlers.\n\nIn 1779, the Comanches began raiding the Bucareli area, and the settlers chose to move further east to the old mission of Nacogdoches, where they founded the town of the same name. The new town quickly became a waystation for contraband. The settlers did not have authorization to move, and no troops were assigned to protect the new location until 1795.\n\nIn 1776, Native Americans at the Bahia missions told the soldiers that the Karankawas had massacred a group of Europeans who had been shipwrecked near the mouth of the Guadalupe River. After finding the remains of an English commercial frigate, the soldiers warned the Karankawa to refrain from attacking seamen. The soldiers continued to explore the coast, and reported that foreign powers could easily build a small settlement on the barrier islands, which were difficult to access from the mainland, and then ascend the Trinity or San Jacinto Rivers into the heart of Texas. Captain Luis Cazorla, the commander of the La Bahía presidio, recommended that Spain build a small fort on the barrier islands and provide a shallow-draft vessel to continually reconnoiter the coast. The fort would be both a deterrent to the more bloodthirsty tribes and to the English. The Spanish government, fearful of smuggling, declined to give permission for a port or a boat on the Texas coast.\n\nDe Croix was unimpressed with his new province, complaining that\n\nDespite his distaste for the area, he increased the number of troops in the interior provinces by 50% and created units of \"light troops\" which did not carry all of the heavy gear and could fight on foot. His administration also attempted to build alliances with native troops, and planned to work with the Comanche and the Wichita to wipe out the Apache raiders. The plan was shelved when Spain entered the American Revolution as an ally of the French and the American revolutionaries and money and troops were diverted to attacking Florida instead of exterminating the Apaches. After soldiers in Coahuila aligned with the Mescaleros against the Lipan Apaches, however, Spain was able to sign a peace treaty with the Lipans. The Comanches were also becoming more brazen, attacking Presidio La Bahía in 1781, where they were repulsed.\n\nAfter hearing that Englishman George Gauld had surveyed Gulf Coast all the way to Galveston Bay in 1777, Bernardo de Gálvez appointed a French engineer, Luis Antonio Andry, to conduct a similar survey for Spain. Andry finished his survey in March 1778, and anchored off Matagorda Bay after running dangerously low on provisions. Over a period of days, the Karankawa lured a few men at a time from the ship with offers of assistance and killed all but one, a Mayan sailor named Tomás de la Cruz. The Karankawa also burned the ship and the newly created map, possibly the first detailed Spanish map of the Texas-Louisiana coast. Several months later, the Native Americans living at Mission Rosario, near La Bahía, escaped to join the Karankawa, and together they began raiding livestock and harassing settlers. The governor pardoned many of the fugitives, and most of them returned to the mission. The Karankawa continued to cause difficulties for the Spanish, and in 1785 the interim commandant-general, Joseph Antonio Rengel, noted that they were unable to explore in the Matagorda Bay region as long as the Karankawa held it.\n\nThe Spanish again arranged for their coastline to be mapped, and in September 1783, José de Evia left Havana to chart the coastline between Key West and Matagorda Bay. During his journey, Evia gave Galveston Bay its name, in honor of his sponsor, De Gálvez. Evia later mapped the Nuevo Santander coast between Matagorda Bay and Tampico, part of which later belonged to Texas.\n\nFor much of the 1770s, the Comanche had raided in New Mexico. They were driven from New Mexico in 1779 by a broad assault led by New Mexico governor Juan Bautista de Anza and redirected their activities to the weakly defended Texas. During the same time period the Apaches, who had been stockpiling guns received from the Karankawas, returned to raiding settlements in Texas, violating their peace treaty. The Comanche promptly declared war on the Apache.\n\nGálvez became the viceroy of New Spain in 1785 and regained control of the interior provinces. Gálvez ordered that the Native Americans be encouraged to use alcohol, which they could only get through trading, and that the firearms they were traded be poorly made so that they would be awkward to use and easy to break. His policies were never implemented, as Spain did not have the money to provide gifts such as those to the tribes. Instead, the Spanish negotiated a treaty with the Comanche in late 1785. The treaty promised annual gifts to the Comanches, and the peace it brought lasted for the next 30 years. By late 1786, northern and western Texas were secure enough that Pedro Vial and a single companion safely \"pioneered a trail from San Antonio to Santa Fe,\" a distance of .\n\nThe Comanches were willing to fight the enemies of their new friends, and soon attacked the Karankawa. Over the next several years, the Comanches killed many of the Karankawa in the area and drove the others into Mexico. By 1804, very few natives lived on the barrier islands, where the Karankawa had made their home. In January 1790, the Comanche also helped the Spanish fight a large battle against the Mescalero and Lipan Apaches at Soledad Creek west of San Antonio. Over 1,000 Comanche warriors participated in raids against the Apache in 1791 and 1792, and the Apache were forced to scatter into the mountains in Mexico. In 1796, Spanish officials began an attempt to have the Apache and Comanche coexist in peace, and over the next ten years the intertribal fighting declined.\n\nIn 1791 and 1792, Fray José Francisco Garza befriended some of the Karankawa and other native peoples. Their friendship allowed Garza to explore much of the coastal areas that had been too dangerous to visit. The Native Americans requested that Garza build a mission at the junction of the San Antonio and Guadalupe Rivers, and in February 1793 Mission Nuestra Señora del Refugio opened near Mission Lake at the head of San Antonio Bay. Over 230 Native Americans lived at the mission initially, but within two years they were forced to move to a less flood-prone site, which became known as Refugio. By the end of the eighteenth century, only a small number of the hunting and gathering tribes within Texas had not been Christianized. In 1793, mission San Antonio de Valero was secularized, and the following year the four remaining missions at San Antonio were partially secularized.\n\nThe Comanches were the dominant group in the Southwest from the 1750s to the 1830s, and the domain they ruled was an empire known as Comanchería. Confronted with Spanish, Mexican, and American outposts on their periphery in New Mexico, Texas, and Coahuila and Nueva Vizcaya in northern Mexico, they worked to increase their own safety, prosperity and power. Their empire collapsed after the Spanish era as their villages were repeatedly decimated by epidemics of smallpox and cholera in the late 1840s; the population plunged from 20,000 to just a few thousand by the 1870s. The Comanches were no longer able to deal with the U.S. Army, which took over control of the region after the Mexican–American War ended in 1848.\n\nThe Comanches operated as an autonomous power inside the area claimed by Spain but not controlled by it. The Comanches used their military power to obtain supplies and labor from the Mexicans, and Native Americans through thievery, tribute, and kidnappings, and the Spanish could do little to stop them because the Comanches controlled most of the horses in the region and thus had more wealth and mobility. Although powered by violence, the Comanche empire was primarily an economic construction, rooted in an extensive commercial network that facilitated long-distance trade. Dealing with subordinate Native Americans, the Comanche spread their language and culture across the region. In terms of governance, the Comanches created a centralized political system, based on a foraging market economy, and a hierarchical social organization.\n\nThe Second Treaty of Paris in 1783 ended the American Revolution and established the United States of America. The treaty extended the new country's western boundary to the Mississippi River and within the first year after it was signed 50,000 American settlers crossed the Appalachian Mountains. As it was difficult to return east across the mountains, the settlers began looking toward the Spanish colonies of Louisiana and Texas to find places to sell their crops. Spain closed the mouth of the Mississippi to foreigners from 1784 until 1795 despite Thomas Jefferson's 1790 threat to begin an Anglo-Spanish war over the matter. Americans risked arrest to come to Texas, many of them desiring to capture wild mustangs in West Texas and trade with the Indians. In 1791, Philip Nolan became the first Anglo-American known to pursue horse-trading in Texas, and he was arrested several times for being within Spain's borders. The Spanish feared that Nolan was a spy, and in 1801 they sent 150 troops to capture Nolan and his party of 6 men; Nolan was killed during the ensuing battle. By 1810, many Americans were trading guns and ammunition to the Texas Indians, especially the Comanche, in return for livestock. Although some chiefs refused to trade with them and reported their movements to Spanish authorities, other bands welcomed the newcomers. A drought made rangeland scarce and stopped the Comanche's herds from increasing. To meet the American demand for livestock, the Comanche turned to raiding the area around San Antonio.\n\nThe Spanish government believed that security would come with a larger population, but was unable to attract colonists from Spain or from other New World colonies. By the late 18th century, Texas was one of the least populated regions of New Spain, with fewer than two inhabitants per square league. The population was relatively stagnant, having grown only to 3,169 individuals in 1790 from 3,103 in 1777. Over half of the population was classified as Spaniards, with settled Indians making up the next largest category. Blacks, mostly slaves, made up less than 1% of the population in 1777, and only 2.2% of the 1793 census. Over two-thirds of the adults in Texas were married, and single men outnumbered single women, although there was a high percentage of widows. Intermarriage was fairly common, mostly between white men and women of mixed origin. Children from these unions often passed as whites. Illegitimate births increased steadily throughout the century, reaching 20% of all births in 1799. Despite the small population, however, Spain actively discouraged immigration to Texas, and a permanent garrison was placed in Nacogdoches in 1790 to keep foreigners from settling in the area. Immigrants from the United States were allowed to settle in Louisiana and Florida after taking an oath of allegiance, but were not required to convert to Roman Catholicism.\n\nIn 1799, Spain gave Louisiana back to France in exchange for the promise of a throne in central Italy. Although the agreement was signed on October 1, 1800, it did not go into effect until 1802. The following year, Napoleon sold Louisiana to the United States. Many of the Spaniards who had moved to the colony left for Texas, Florida, or other Spanish-held lands. The original agreement between Spain and France had not explicitly specified the borders of Louisiana, and the descriptions in the documents were ambiguous and contradictory. Even when both territories had been under Spanish control, there was disagreement on where the border should be. In 1793, the King of Spain decided that there was no need to move the boundary from Natchitoches to the Sabine River, as had been recommended by some Frenchmen.\n\nThe United States insisted that its purchase also included most of West Florida and all of Texas. Thomas Jefferson claimed that Louisiana stretched west to the Rocky Mountains and included the entire watershed of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers and their tributaries, and that the southern border was the Rio Grande. Spain maintained that Louisiana extended only as far as Natchitoches, and that it did not include the Illinois Territory.\n\nTexas was again considered a buffer province, this time between New Spain and the United States. In 1804, Spain planned to send thousands of colonists to increase the number of residents in Texas (then at 4,000 Hispanic inhabitants). The plan was cancelled as the government did not have the money to relocate the settlers. The responsibility for defending Texas now rested with Nemesio Salcedo, who held the newly reopened position of Commandant General of the Internal Provinces. Salcedo promoted immigration to Texas, and a new town, Trinidad de Salcedo, was founded where the Trinity River intersected the road from San Antonio to Nacogdoches. For a brief time, Salcedo also allowed former Spanish subjects from Louisiana to come to Texas. A few Americans who had become naturalized Spaniards settled in Texas during that time. Salcedo warned, however, that \"'the foreigners are not and will not be anything but crows to pick out our eyes.'\"\n\nKing Charles IV of Spain ordered data compiled to determine the true boundary. Before the border was settled, both sides led armed excursions into the disputed areas, and Spain began increasing the number of troops stationed in Texas. By 1806, the number had doubled, with over 883 stationed in and around Nacogdoches. At the end of 1806, local commanders negotiated a temporary agreement in which neither the Spanish nor the Americans would venture into the area between the Sabine River and Arroyo Hondo. This neutral ground quickly became a haven for lawlessness and it did not stop individuals from crossing the boundary. While on a mission for the United States Army to explore some of the disputed areas of the Louisiana Purchase Zebulon Pike was arrested by the Spanish while camping on the Rio Grande and escorted back to Natchitoches. Although his maps and notes were confiscated, Pike was able to recreate most of it from memory. His glowing comments about Texas lands and animals made many Americans yearn to control the territory.\n\nIn May 1808, Napoleon forced King Ferdinand VII to abdicate the Spanish throne. His replacement, Napoleon's elder brother Joseph Bonaparte (Joseph I), was appointed King of Spain, to violent protests from the Spanish citizens. The uprisings continued for the next six years, until his abdication in 1814 and the return of Ferdinand VII. During the time, there was little oversight of the New World colonies. A shadow government operated out Cádiz during Joseph's reign, operating under the Spanish Constitution of 1812. The constitutional government included representatives from the colonies, including Texas and New Mexico in New Spain. When King Ferdinand VII resumed his throne, he refused to recognize the new constitution or the representative government. He was forced to change his mind in 1820 as the only way to avert a military coup.\n\nDuring this time of turmoil, it was unclear who actually governed the colonies: Joseph I, the shadow government representing Ferdinand VII, the colonial officials, or revolutionaries in each province. The Mexican War of Independence began in 1810 at the instigation of Miguel Hidalgo. Fearing that the revolution would reach colonial Texas, governor Manuel María de Salcedo ordered the Texas borders closed to all foreigners. He was soon reversed by his uncle, the Commandant General. Revolutionaries soon overthrew and imprisoned Salcedo, and a new government was established in Texas. Salcedo persuaded Ignacio Elizondo (his jailer) to return to the royalist cause and the two organized a counter-coup. Hidalgo was captured and executed in 1811.\n\nAlthough officially neutral during the Mexican War of Independence, the United States allowed rebels to trade at American ports and much of the weaponry and ammunition used by the rebels came from the United States. Americans also provided manpower for the conflict, with Natchitoches serving as a launching point for several expeditions into Texas. In 1812, Mexican insurgent Bernardo Gutiérrez de Lara led a small force of Americans into Texas. Indians from the eastern part of Texas quickly joined the insurgency. Calling themselves the Republican Army of the North, the group captured San Antonio in 1813, assassinated the governor, Manuel María de Salcedo, and proclaimed Texas independent from Spain. The death of the governor caused many of the Anglo-Americans to desert the cause, but on April 17, 1813, the Gutiérrez–Magee Expedition members composed Texas's first constitution, which provided for a centralized form of government. Spanish forces recaptured the province later that year at the Battle of Medina, and killed 1300 and executed any Tejanos accused of having Republican tendencies. Within 2 weeks almost 400 rebels were executed and their wives and daughters were imprisoned for 2 months. Royalist soldiers even chased many of the women and children who had fled San Antonio, killing 200–300. Captured Americans were given an opportunity to take an oath of loyalty to Spain, and those who refused were escorted back to the United States. Fearing that the Comanche would still constitute a threat, Spanish general Arredondo ordered all ranchers to move temporarily to San Antonio to help defend the city. When they returned to their ranches several months later, they found that the Comanche had slaughtered all of the livestock, leaving most of the carcasses where they fell. The Spanish army looted the rest of Texas too, and by 1820 fewer than 2000 Hispanic citizens remained in Texas. \"Spanish Texas, or what remained of it, had become a desolate, unprotected land that could not feed itself.\"\n\nAnother revolutionary, José Manuel Herrera, created a government on Galveston Island in September 1816 which he proclaimed part of a Mexican Republic. A group of French exiles in the United States attempted to create their own colony on the Trinity River, known as Le Champ d'Asile. The exiles planned to use the colony as a base to liberate New Spain and then free Napoleon from St. Helena. They abandoned the colony shortly and returned to Galveston.\nOn February 22, 1819, Spain and the United States reached agreement on the Transcontinental Treaty, which ceded Florida to the United States in return for the United States relinquishing its claim on Texas. The official boundary of Texas was set at the Sabine River (the current boundary between Texas and Louisiana), then following the Red and Arkansas Rivers to the 42nd parallel (California's current northern border). For the next two years, until early February 1821, Spain delayed ratification of the treaty, using it as leverage to prevent the United States from formally recognizing one of the rebellious Spanish colonies as an independent nation. During this period many Americans spoke out against the treaty and the renunciation of the claim to Texas. An essay in the \"City of Washington Gazette\" denounced the treaty, claiming that \"'a league'\" of the land in Texas was worth more to the United States \"'than the whole territory west of the Rocky Mountains'\".\n\nIn 1819, James Long led the Long Expedition to invade Texas. He declared Texas an independent republic, but by the end of the year his rebellion had been quelled by Colonel Ignacio Pérez and his Spanish troops. The following year Long established a new base near Galveston Bay \"to free Texas from 'the yoke of Spanish authority... the most atrocious despotism that ever disgraced the annals of Europe.'\" His basis for a rebellion was soon gone, however.\n\nOn February 24, 1821, Agustín de Iturbide launched a drive for Mexican Independence. Texas became a part of the newly independent nation without a shot being fired.\n\nSpanish control of Texas was followed by Mexican control of Texas, and it can be difficult to separate the Spanish and Mexican influences on the future state. The most obvious legacy is that of the language; the state's name comes from the Spanish rendering of an Indian word. Every major river in modern Texas, except the Red River, has a Spanish or Anglicized name, as do 42 of the state's 254 counties and numerous towns also bear Spanish names. Even many of the words that have been incorporated into American English, such as barbecue, canyon, ranch, and plaza, come from Spanish words. An additional obvious legacy is that of Roman Catholicism. At the end of Spain's reign over Texas, virtually all inhabitants practiced the Catholic religion, and it is still practiced in Texas by a large number of people. The Spanish missions built in San Antonio to convert Indians to Catholicism have been restored and are a National Historic Landmark.\n\nThe landscape of Texas was changed as a result of some Spanish policies. As early as the 1690s, Spaniards brought European livestock, including cattle, horses, and mules, with them on their expeditions throughout the province. Some of the livestock strayed or stayed behind when the Spanish retreated from the territory in 1693, allowing the Indian tribes to begin loosely managing herds of the animals. These herds grazed heavily on the native grasses, allowing mesquite, which was native to the lower Texas coast, to spread inland. Although the introduced livestock were able to adapt to the changing conditions, the buffalo had a more difficult time grazing among the new vegetation, beginning the decline in their numbers. Spanish farmers also introduced tilling and irrigation to the land, further changing the landscape. Spanish architectural concepts were also adopted by those in Texas, including the addition of patios, tile floors and roofs, arched windows and doorways, carved wooden doors, and wrought iron grillwork.\n\nAlthough Texas eventually adopted much of the Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal practices were retained. Among these was the Spanish model of keeping certain personal property safe from creditors. Texas implemented the first homestead exemption in the United States in 1839, and its property exemption laws are now the most liberal state in the United States. Furthermore, Spanish law maintained that both husband and wife should share equally in the profits of marriage, and, like many other former Spanish provinces, Texas retained the idea of community property rather than use the Anglo laws in which all property belonged to the husband. Furthermore, Spanish law allowed an independent executor to be named in probate cases who is not required to gain court permission for each act not explicitly listed in the testament. Texas retained this idea, and it has eventually spread to other states, included Arizona, Washington, and Idaho. In other legal matters, Texas kept the Spanish principle of adoption, becoming the first U.S. state to allow adoption.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2050151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050151", "title": "ALARP", "text": "ALARP\n\nALARP, which stands for \"as low as reasonably practicable\", or ALARA (\"as low as reasonably achievable\"), is a term often used in the regulation and management of safety-critical and safety-involved systems. The ALARP principle is that the residual risk shall be reduced as far as reasonably practicable. In UK and NZ Health and Safety law, it is equivalent to SFAIRP (\"so far as is reasonably practicable\").\n\nFor a risk to be ALARP, it must be possible to demonstrate that the cost involved in reducing the risk further would be grossly disproportionate to the benefit gained. The ALARP principle arises from the fact that infinite time, effort and money could be spent in the attempt of reducing a risk to zero. It should not be understood as simply a quantitative measure of benefit against detriment. It is more a best common practice of judgement of the balance of risk and societal benefit.\n\nIn this context, risk is the combination of the frequency (likelihood) and the consequence of a specified hazardous event.\n\nThe following factors are likely to be considered when deciding whether or not a risk has been reduced as far as reasonably practical.\n\nAnother factor that often comes into the ALARP principle, is the cost of assessing the improvement gained in an attempted risk reduction. In extremely complex systems, this can be very high, and could be the limiting factor in practicability of risk reduction, although according to HSE guidance, cost alone should never be a justification for taking extra safety risks.\n\nDetermining that a risk has been reduced to ALARP involves an assessment of the risk to be avoided, of the sacrifice (in money, time and trouble) involved in taking measures to avoid that risk, and a comparison of the two. This is a cost–benefit analysis.\n\nThe term ALARP arises from UK legislation, particularly the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, which requires \"Provision and maintenance of plant and systems of work that are, so far as is reasonably practicable, safe and without risks to health\". The phrase So Far As is Reasonably Practicable (SFARP) in this and similar clauses is interpreted as leading to a requirement that risks must be reduced to a level that is As Low As is Reasonably Practicable (ALARP).\n\nThe key question in determining whether a risk is ALARP is the definition of reasonably practicable. This term has been enshrined in the UK case law since the case of \"Edwards v. National Coal Board\" in 1949. The ruling was that the risk must be significant in relation to the sacrifice (in terms of money, time or trouble) required to avert it: risks must be averted unless there is a gross disproportion between the costs and benefits of doing so.\n\nIncluding gross disproportion means that an ALARP judgement in the UK is not a simple cost benefit analysis, but is weighted to favour carrying out the safety improvement. However, there is no broad consensus on the precise factor that would be appropriate.\n\nOutside the UK the ALARP principle is often not used; instead standards and 'good engineering practice' are adhered to, and legislation tends to require absolute levels of safety .\n\nThe term ALARA, or \"as low as reasonably achievable\" is used interchangeably in the United States of America, almost exclusively in the field of radiation protection .\n\nWhere the ALARP principle is used, it may not have the same implications as in the UK, as \"reasonably practicable\" may be interpreted according to the local culture, without introducing the concept of gross disproportionality.\n\nStarfish Medical, a company focusing on medical device contract manufacturing and product development, through the Medical Device Directive of Canada is undergoing extensive consideration of the transfer of ALARP to AFAP (“As Far As Possible”) specifically for the regulation of risk of medical devices. The ALARP concept contains legal interpretation of the regulatory process that promotes financial consideration in higher regard than of the requirements of safety and performance of medical devices. Contradicting this approach, AFAP requires that all ventures of safety must be addressed in the intent of the consumer and effectiveness of the product rather than capital gain of the corporation. Under AFAP standards there are two defined justifications for the lack of implementation of risk-preventative measures. The first indicates that the additional risk control will not provide additional support for the system, such as an additional alarm when a previous alarm is functioning. The second states that a risk control system does not have to be implemented if there is a more effective risk control that can not be simultaneously executed due to various scenarios such as spatial boundaries. By implementing this new standard of risk mitigation, companies must demonstrate that they have considered and implemented all necessary means of addressing risk of a product or developed system. \n\nA two-year legal battle in the European Court of Justice resulted in the SFAIRP principle being upheld on 18 January 2007 .\n\nThe European Commission had claimed that the SFAIRP wording in the Health & Safety at Work Act did not fully implement the requirements of the Framework Directive. The Directive gives employers an absolute duty \"to ensure the safety and health of workers in every aspect related to the work\", whereas the Act qualifies the duty \"So Far As is Reasonably Practicable\". The court dismissed the action and ordered the Commission to pay the UK's costs.\n\nHad the case been upheld, it would have called into question the proportionate approach to safety risk management embodied in the ALARP principle.\n\nThe carrot diagram is intended to show high (normally unacceptable) risks at the upper/wider end and low (broadly acceptable) risks at the lower/narrower end. The region in between is sometimes called the \"ALARP region\". However, this is misleading because there is no legal requirement for risks to be tolerable, nor any recognition that low risks may be regarded as broadly acceptable. ALARP refers to the principle of testing further risk reduction against the cost of this reduction effort. It therefore applies to all regions, so the diagram is a misinterpretation of UK law.\n\n\n"}

Pumaqawa was a member of the Inca nobility of Ayarmaca descent, who also has some Spanish ancestry.\n\nHe was appointed commander of the Royalist Army militias against Túpac Amaru II. Reason for this is because Amaru's uprising caught off guard colonial authorities and caused major tumult in Lima, as the colonial authorities were largely unprepared and scarce of troops in order to deal with the revolt, for this reason, Spanish colonial authorities decided to organize an army composed largely of native conscripts, a tactic repeated in the Peruvian independence wars where the Spanish royalist army of Peru was composed, outside of commanding leaders, almost entirely of levy indigenous soldiers.\n\nAs Pumakawa became head of the Royal Army indigenous militias, he persecuted José Gabriel Condorcanqui (Tupac Amaru II) during his rebellion of 1780 and 1781, Pumakawa made major contributions to the royal cause with accouterments and men. He gained prestige among the Inca nobility of Cuzco, being elected Real Ensign of Noble Indians of Cuzco in 1802. \n\nPumacahua defeated the rebel army of Tupac Amaru II in 1781, an event depicted in a mural at the church of Chinchero, although he received fame and prestige for Amaru's capture, his role was little acknowledged outside of Cuzco and Peru in spite of the fact that it was Pumaqawa, more than anyone, who defeated Tupac Amaru II. Higher-rank Spanish authorities such as the Viceroy Agustín de Jáuregui, who resided in Lima for all the duration of the conflict, received most of the credit and praise for the capture and defeat of Tupac Amaru II.\n\nThree decades later, despite being in his seventies, Pumakawa led the — essentially indigenous — militias of the Royal Army of Peru, the bulk of the army, in the expeditions of the Peruvian viceroy José Fernando de Abascal sent against the junta of La Paz in Upper Peru during 1811. Despite having won the battle of Guaqui as colonel of the Royal Army, he and a portion of his troops joined the insurrection of central and southern of Viceroyalty of Peru (Cuzco, Huamanga, Arequipa and Puno) started in Cuzco on August 3, 1814, demanding the full implementation of the Spanish Constitution of 1812 in Peru. Pumacahua was appointed member of the governing junta. Pumacahua led the forces that occupied Arequipa on November 10. On November 30, Pumacahua's troops retreated from Arequipa to the Cuzco and Puno regions. On March 11, 1815, Pumacahua and his troops were defeated in the battle of Umachiri. He was captured and executed in May by the royal army militias.\n\n"}

Debi Massey served as hostess and Chuck Riley was the announcer. The show was produced by Telepictures Productions, Createl, Ltd., and Fiedler-Berlin Productions, with Warner Bros. Television distributing. It was based on the British game show \"Bob's Full House\", which consisted of contestants trying to answer questions to fill up a 15-square bingo board.\n\nThe show was filmed at the Trump Castle (now known as \"Golden Nugget Atlantic City\") casino hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Donald Trump made a cameo appearance on its premiere episode to inaugurate the show with Cefalo.\n\nLaunching the same day as \"The Quiz Kids Challenge\" and revivals of \"The Joker's Wild\" and \"Tic-Tac-Dough\", \"Trump Card\" joined those series and \"The Challengers\" (which premiered a week before) as one of five new syndicated game shows for the 1990–91 television season. All five shows were cancelled after one single season. \"The Challengers\" and \"Trump Card\" were the only two of the five which made it through a full season before ending. After the season concluded, reruns aired until September 13, 1991.\n\nThree contestants were each given a bingo-style card with 15 numbers, arranged in three rows of five, and competed to fill in all the numbers. One contestant had the numbers 1-15, the second had 16-30, and the third had 31-45. These numbers were also used in an audience game, described below.\n\nFour categories were displayed, each containing four questions, and the winner of a random backstage draw chose one to start the round. The host read a toss-up question; if a contestant buzzed-in with the correct answer, the number in one corner of his/her card was filled in and he/she chose the next category. An incorrect buzz-in answer froze the contestant out of the next question, whose category was chosen by the host.\n\nThe first person to fill in all four corners won $750, which was his/hers to keep regardless of the game's outcome.\n\nAt the beginning of the round, the contestants were each given a Trump Card. After giving a correct answer, a contestant could play the Trump Card to impede the progress of one of the his/her opponents. That contestant would have his/her card blocked with a giant letter T, which could only be removed with a correct answer. Cefalo reminded the contestants that their Trump Cards could be used at any point during the next two rounds, but if the winning contestant managed to keep the Trump Card, he/she would gain an \"additional advantage\" he would explain later.\n\nFour new categories were displayed, each containing five questions, and the winner of round one chose first. Gameplay proceeded as in round one, but every correct answer now filled in a number on the middle row of the contestant's card. The first contestant to complete his/her row won $1,500.\n\nThis round consisted of rapid-fire general knowledge questions, and every correct answer filled in one of the remaining numbers on the contestant's card. An incorrect response froze him/her out of the next question as before. The first contestant to complete his/her card won the game, plus $3,000 and advanced to the bonus round. If time was called before this happened, the contestant who had the most numbers filled in and was not hindered by a Trump Card was declared the winner. In the event of a tie, an all-or-nothing tossup was asked of the tied contestants; answering correctly won the game while an incorrect answer gave the victory to the opponent.\n\nThe numbers 1 through 25 were displayed on a 5-by-5 grid. The champion drew one card from a deck of 25, and the space with the chosen number was filled in. He/she drew a second card if he/she had not used their Trump Card during the main game.\n\nThe champion then had 45 seconds to complete a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of five spaces by answering general knowledge questions. He/she chose a space, and the host asked a question. A correct answer filled in the space, but a pass or miss blacked it out. If the champion completed the line within 45 seconds it was worth an additional $10,000. Otherwise, the champion left with whatever he/she won during the main game. The maximum amount a winning contestant could win on a regular episode of \"Trump Card\" was $15,250, which could only be achieved by winning all three rounds in the main game and then winning the bonus round.\n\nThree new contestants competed on each episode; there were no returning champions. However, each contestant was competing for a chance to be invited back at the end of the season to participate in a tournament of champions.\n\nAudience members were each given their own double-sided cards. The front of each card followed the pattern of those used by the contestants. When a contestant answered a question correctly and filled in a number, audience members could mark it off on their cards as well. Any member who reached the goal of a round before the contestants won $10; this payout could be collected in one, two, or all three rounds, for a maximum of $30.\n\nThe other side of the card had a 3-by-3 grid of nine numbers to be used in the bonus round. If the number drawn by the champion appeared on this grid, the audience member's winnings were increased by 50% (e.g. from $20 to $30). If the champion drew a second number due to saving his/her Trump Card, and this number also appeared on the grid, the member's winnings were doubled (e.g. from $20 to $40). Members marked off numbers as the contestant gave correct answers, and any member who completed a line of three had his/her entire winnings total doubled.\n\nAudience members could win up to $120, by winning $10 in each of the three rounds, doubling the money with two matching draws in the bonus round, and doubling again by completing a line of three numbers.\n\nAs previously mentioned \"Trump Card\" ended its first and only season with a tournament of champions played for a potential top prize of $100,000 in cash. The tournament took place over ten episodes spanning two weeks and featured twenty-one bonus round winners.\n\nSeven preliminary matches were played with winners receiving $3,000, but no additional money awarded for winning either of the first two rounds. The bonus round was still played, with the same $10,000 prize awarded. After the preliminaries, the winner who performed the best was given the first berth in the final match. The other six winners played in two matches the following two days to determine the other two finalists.\n\nThe final match was played for $10,000, with the runners-up each garnering $2,500 for advancing that far. The winner then played the bponus round one final time. This time, he/she was given a choice of three different question packets to choose from before the game began. After choosing the packet and his/her free space(s), the round was played as it normally would be; the only difference was that if the tournament winner successfully completed it, his/her match winnings would be multiplied by ten for a total of $100,000. The prize went unclaimed, however, as the tournament winner was unable to complete the bonus round successfully.\n"}

It is situated on the north-western border of Stockport, adjacent to Didsbury and Burnage in Manchester.\n\nHeaton Mersey is a mostly residential area and commuter zone for Manchester. Heaton Mersey and its neighbouring areas (Heaton Norris, Heaton Chapel and Heaton Moor) are collectively known as the Four Heatons. Part of Heaton Mersey has been designated a conservation area.\n\nHeaton Mersey lies on the north bank of the River Mersey, just a few miles downstream from its source in Stockport town centre.

Just off Didsbury Road, opposite Heaton Mersey village, lies 'The Bowl' which is a large depression in the ground used as open green space.\n\nHeaton Mersey Common, which is another nature reserve with fields and woodland, is situated next to the former Cranford Golf range. It, too, contains a large pond.\n\nOut of the four Heatons, Heaton Mersey has the most green space by area and is the only to be situated on a river or contain any substantial water body.\n\nHeaton Mersey railway station, which was open from 1 January 1880 until 3 July 1961, was built by the Midland Railway and was situated on the line from to Manchester Central. The station was situated at the southern end of Station Road, which still exists. The extension to Station Road, connecting it to the western end of Craig Road so as to create access for residential development, runs parallel to the old track bed of the Midland line from Stockport Tiviot Dale.\n\nFrom January 1889 until 4 May 1968, there was a steam locomotive running shed named Heaton Mersey, coded 9F. It lay on the north bank of the Mersey and was reached by a footbridge, still extant, leading from Gorsey Bank Road.\n\nTransport in Heaton Mersey today generally consists of local buses operated by Stagecoach Manchester and First Greater Manchester along the main thoroughfare, the A5145 Didsbury Road. Local buses allow for connections to Metrolink at East Didsbury, National Rail at East Didsbury and Stockport, and local buses at Stockport bus station. Road connections are available via the A5145 to the A34 at Parrs Wood, and the A6 at Stockport. The M60 is also accessible at Junctions 1, 2 and 3.\n\nSchools include the primary schools: Tithe Barn, Didsbury Road, Mersey Vale and Saint Winifred's RC Primary School, famous for St Winifred's School Choir and chart hits in the 1980s, and Stella Maris School, an independent primary school, all rated outstanding; and St. John's Church of England, which is rated good. The local comprehensive is Priestnall School, also rated outstanding. Pre-schools are Freshfields, Didsbury Road, both rated outstanding and Mersey Vale.\n\nThe area has a Sea Scout base on Didsbury Road, with beaver scouts, cub scouts and sea scouts currently active. It also hosts regular Harvest farmer's markets, car boot sales and family fun days. The Moorfest music festival was held at the Heaton Mersey Bowl in 2005, which included appearances from Badly Drawn Boy and Howard Marks. Local attractions include the River Mersey, around which there is a nature park and trail. Heaton Mersey Common with its several pubs, delis, restaurants and shops supply the local amenities to the area. Heaton Mersey Park has a local fishing pond and further down station road is day-ticket fishing pond. Heaton Mersey is also home to the Heaton Mersey Lacrosse Team, who play in England's Northern Lacrosse division.\n\nThe Stockport-based band Blossoms used Heaton Mersey Bowl and the adjacent Vale Close to film sections of the music video for the song \"Honey Sweet\".\n\n\n"}

It assigns priority based on the \"slack time\" of a process. Slack time is the amount of time left after a job if the job was started now. This algorithm is also known as least laxity first. Its most common use is in embedded systems, especially those with multiple processors. It imposes the simple constraint that each process on each available processor possesses the same run time, and that individual processes do not have an affinity to a certain processor. This is what lends it a suitability to embedded systems.\n\nThis scheduling algorithm first selects those processes that have the smallest \"slack time\". Slack time is defined as the temporal difference between the deadline, the ready time and the run time.\n\nMore formally, the \"slack time\" formula_1 for a process is defined as:\n\nformula_2\n\nwhere formula_3 is the process deadline, formula_4 is the real time since the cycle start, and formula_5 is the remaining computation time.\n\nIn realtime scheduling algorithms for periodic jobs, an acceptance test is needed before accepting a sporadic job with a hard deadline. One of the simplest acceptance tests for a sporadic job is calculating the amount of slack time between the release time and deadline of the job.\n\nLST scheduling is most useful in systems comprising mainly aperiodic tasks, because no prior assumptions are made on the events' rate of occurrence. The main weakness of LST is that it does not look ahead, and works only on the current system state. Thus, during a brief overload of system resources, LST can be suboptimal. It will also be suboptimal when used with uninterruptible processes. However, like earliest deadline first, and unlike rate monotonic scheduling, this algorithm can be used for processor utilization up to 100%.\n"}

His works were banned when the Nazis came to power and he went into exile in France; however, there he was imprisoned as a \"foreign enemy\". He died in Les Milles (Camp des Milles) near Aix-en-Provence.\n\nBorn in Aachen, Germany, the son of the doctor Carl Georg Hasenclever (1855–1934) and his wife Mathilde Anna (1869–1953), Walter Hasenclever began studying law at Oxford University in 1908 before changing to the University of Lausanne. From 1909 to 1914 he studied in Leipzig, where he became interested in literature and philosophy. In 1910 he published his first volume of poems, \"Towns, nights and people\" (\"Städte, Nächte und Menschen\"). In 1914 his play \"The Son\" (\"Der Sohn\") was his first successful Expressionist drama.\n\nAt first, Hasenclever was pro-war and volunteered for military service; soon, however, he came to reject the war. He simulated mental illness and was released from duty in 1917. That same year he was presented with the Kleist Prize for his passionate adaptation of Sophocles' \"Antigone\". He was a good friend of the artist Oskar Kokoschka who depicted him in his 1918 work \"The Friends\" with Käthe Richter in Dresden, where Hasenclever was recuperating from his \"illness\" in a sanatorium.\n\nIn 1924, Hasenclever met Kurt Tucholsky; at this time he worked as a French correspondent for the magazine \"8-Uhr-Abendblatt\", spending a lot of time in Paris, where he also befriended the dramatist Jean Giraudoux. In 1926 he produced the successful comedy \"A Better Gentleman\" (\"Ein besserer Herr\") and in 1928 the comedy \"Marriages are Made in Heaven\" (\"Ehen werden im Himmel geschlossen\"). In 1930, he wrote scripts for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for Greta Garbo; at this time he lived in Berlin in an \"artists' colony\". When the National Socialists took power in 1933, his works were banned, burned during the book burning, then removed from libraries. Hasenclever went into exile in Nice. In 1934, he married Edith Schläfer there.\n\nDuring the Second World War Hasenclever was imprisoned twice as a \"foreign enemy\" in France. When France fell to Germany, he was in the prison camp of Camp des Milles in the south-east of France. In the early hours of 22 June 1940 he took his own life with an overdose of the barbiturate \"Veronal\", so as not to fall into the hands of the Nazis.\n\nSince 1996 the Walter Hasenclever Prize has been awarded to a German-language writer every two years. Winners have included Peter Rühmkorf (1996), George Tabori (1998), Oskar Pastior (2000), Marlene Steerewitz (2002) and Friedrich Christian Delius (2004).

He was one of five children. They were neighbors to the Vermehren family whose son, Frederik Vermehren would also become an artist, and student of Jørgen Roed.\n\nAlready while in school he had the opportunity to learn to draw and paint under schoolteacher J.J. Fyhn. Although the quality of that education was not particularly impressive, Roed’s enthusiasm was enough to inspire his parents to send him to Copenhagen in 1822 after his confirmation to train at the Royal Danish Academy of Art (\"Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi\").\n\nHe was recommended to train under portraitist Hans Hansen, father of Constantin Hansen, where he studied privately, and began to paint. The most lasting result of his education under Hansen was the friendship Roed developed with Constantine, the teacher’s son. Roed’s training under Hansen was limited to making copies of other artworks, such as his first exhibited painting in 1824, an angel’s head painted after another copy based on a work by Raphael. It was first in 1826 that he exhibited an independent piece, a portrait of his first art teacher.\n\nHe had also started his training at the Academy at the same time, first in the free hand drawing school in 1822, and then in 1825 in the School of Plaster Cast Painting. He exhibited at Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition for the first time in 1824, and continued showing there regularly throughout his life.\n\nHansen died in 1828, and both Roed and the younger Hansen came into training under Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, father of the \"Golden Age of Danish Painting\". Roed and Hansen were friends, and socialized much. Hansen was often a guest in the Roed’s home, and they traveled together in Denmark painting side-by-side.\n\nHis academic years went slowly but evenly; he was a solid student, and a solid painter. Eckersberg had a strong influence on his artistic development. Roed became a lifelong and loyal admirer of Eckersberg, and his principles of exact and careful observations of nature.\n\nHe developed his own style within genre painting, and became proficient in portrait painting. He first won the Academy’s little silver medallion along with a cash prize in 1831, and then the large silver medallion in 1833. He did not compete for the gold medallion.\n\nHe traveled to Norway in 1831.\n\nHe showed early his talent as an architecture painter, and twice won competitions in this discipline at the Art Union (\"Kunstforening\"). He won the competition, themed “A public place or building”, in 1836 with his painting was \"\"Parti af Frederiksborg. Karusselporten\"\" (\"View of Frederiksborg Castle, The Karrusel Gate\"). Niels Lauritz Høyen, who selected the theme of the competition, was a critic, art historian, leader of the Art Union and teacher at the Academy at the time. In this way he was able to infect many young artists with his interest in nationalism, and to influence their artistic development. The painting is now in the collection of the Horsens Art Museum.\n\nHe painted a number of architectural paintings during the mid-1830s including a pair featuring Roskilde Cathedral. His painting \"\"En gade i Roskilde. I baggrunden domkirken\"\" (\"A Street in Roskilde, in the Background the Cathedral\") painted in 1835-36 is in the collection of the National Art Museum (‘’Statens Museum for Kunst’’). He features the cathedral in an atmospheric streetscape, which combines his architectural perspective with a sense of its surroundings and the people that live there.\n\nStarting in 1835 he began seeking a travel stipend from the Academy, but he had stiff competition from both Wilhelm Marstrand and Louis Gurlitt, fellow students who would be prioritised higher than him for these limited funds. He, therefore, first received a two-year travel stipend in 1837, which was later renewed for a second two-year term. This allowed him to live in Italy 1837-1841.\n\nBefore leaving on his travels he became engaged to Emilie Mathilde Kruse, who waited for his return to marry.\n\nHe traveled first to Düsseldorf, and then to Italy where he stayed primarily in Rome. He also traveled to Naples in the company of Constantin Hansen and Wilhelm Marstrand. During his Italian stay he strengthened his skills painting landscapes and especially architecture. He made several paintings that come close to being architecture paintings, as well as several altarpieces for country churches. He also painted a copy based on a large painting by Raphael. A major work from this period was \"\"Fængselsgården i Palazzo del Bargello\"\" (\"Prison Yard at the Palazzo del Bargello\"), where Roed combined his fine sense of architecture with a lively group of local people into a scene fit for a genre painting.\n\nHe returned to Denmark in 1842, where these paintings were well received. Roed concentrated his efforts on establishing a career at the Academy.\n\nHe married his fiancée on 22 May 1842. They had two children, son Holger Roed, who would become an artist like his father, and daughter Helena (Helena Nyblom, née Roed), Swedish-Danish writer who would marry Carl Rupert Nyblom, art historian and member of the Swedish Academy. The couple gathered about them a circle of artists and artists’ friends, including the younger Julius Lange, upon whom Roed has a great influence.\n\nIn the summer of 1843 he was invited to become a member of the Academy based on a portrait he made of J.C. Drewsen. He submitted a portrait of sculptor H.V. Bissen for his admission piece, and was accepted into the Academy as a portraitist in 1844. These monumentally conceived painting set the standard for his many solidly produced portraits in the years to come.\n\nHe traveled to Dresden in September 1850, and again in April–November 1851.\n\nHe traveled from November 1861-March 1862, travelling to London for the World’s Exhibition where his work was on display, and then to Paris, Florence and Rome. After his return to Denmark he was named professor at the Academy’s School of Model Painting in 1862. He traveled again to Italy between August and November, 1871 (Pompeii, Capri, Rome), to Berlin July–August 1873 and to Paris August–September 1878 for the World Exhibition.\n\nHe continued teaching at the Academy until October 1887, when he took his resignation and received the title of State Councillor (\"etatsråd\").\n\nHe died August 8, 1888 at the age of 80 in Copenhagen. He was survived by his wife and daughter.\n\nIn addition to many portraits he painted a number of altarpieces and religious paintings, including \"\"Jesu Korsfæstelse\"\" (\"Crucifixion of Jesus\") in 1866 for the restored church at Frederiksborg Palace.\n\nIn his later years he sculpted a portrait of his wife in marble.\n\nHis training and career began against the backdrop of an exciting time in Danish history, the transition between the authoritative monarchy and the establishment and development of democracy—the period of the Golden Age of Danish Painting as promoted by Eckersberg, and the strong sense of patriotism and nationalism exemplified by Høyen’s theories. In Roed’s later years there would be great changes in artistic sensibilities. Roed’s artistic abilities continued to be solid throughout his lifetime, although the Golden Age ideals he represented were long gone, and replaced by new creative impulses.\n\nHis academic efforts can not be underestimated as many young artists were trained under his solid and inspiring leadership during his 25 years as professor.\n\nHis paintings are in the collection of many Danish museums including the National Art Museum (‘’Statens Museum for Kunst’’), the Hirschsprung Collection, the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Ordrupgaard, and local art museums in Aarhus, Horsens, Ribe and Randers.\n\nHis portraits document many important people of his times including poet Adam Oehlenschläger, bishop and poet Thomas Kingo and artists E.W. Norman, Albert Küchler, Jørgen Sonne, P.C. Skovgaard, and Wilhelm Marstrand. He painted selfportraits in 1829, 1866, and 1883.\n\n\n"}

His father, the owner of a linotype printing shop, relocated the family to the western suburb of Morón a few years later, and Lavagna enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires, where he graduated with a degree in political economy in 1967.\n\nHe then obtained a scholarship to study in Belgium, where he earned a graduate degree in econometrics and economic policy. At the university, he met Claudine Marechal, a student from Belgium whom he married in 1970, and with whom he had three children. Lavagna also holds an honorary doctorate from the University of Concepción del Uruguay.\n\nFollowing the election of Peronist candidate Héctor Cámpora in 1973, Lavagna was named National Director of Price Policy in the Commerce Secretariat, and was shortly afterwards named Director of Incomes Policy by the Economy Minister, José Ber Gelbard; as such he helped oversee a key policy initiative of Gelbard's \"Social Pact,\" which sought to involve management in efforts to control inflation while raising stagnant median wages. Gelbard's resignation in November 1974 led to Lavagna's entry into the private sector following a stint at the Ministry of Public Works, becoming a member of the board of directors of La Cantábrica, a since closed Morón steelmaker, until 1976. He also co-founded \"Ecolatina\", a think tank, in 1975, and was a member of the board of the Institute for Applied Economics and Society (IdEAS), from 1980 to 1990.\n\nLavagna reentered public service as President Raúl Alfonsín's Secretary of Industry and Foreign Commerce, between 1985 and 1987, during which he helped negotiate the preliminary trade accords with Brazil that later led to the establishment of the Mercosur trade region in 1991. He left the board of Ecolatina in 2000 to accept a post as Ambassador-at-large to international economic conferences, and to the European Union.\n\nLavagna was appointed Economy Minister by interim President Eduardo Duhalde, on April 27, 2002. Taking office at the depth of the Argentine economic crisis, Lavagna prioritized the planned rescision of the \"corralito\" (withdrawal limits on local bank account) over the stabilization of the Argentine peso, which had declined by 75% in four months. This put him at odds with the President of the Central Bank, Mario Blejer, who resigned in June. The peso stabilized, however, as foreign trade surpluses mounted, and confidence returned to the Argentine financial system. The corralito was phased out between December 2002 and March 2003, the economy began a vigorous recovery, and Lavagna was confirmed in his post by President Néstor Kirchner upon his taking office in May 2003. Lavagna earned further plaudits from his handling the Argentine debt restructuring, launched on January 14, 2005, by which more than 76% of the defaulted public debt bonds (worth about 93 billion dollars) for longer-term debt, with an important reduction in principal.\n\nDespite these successes, the Economy Minister was ousted by President Kirchner on November 28, 2005, after a week or so of persistent rumors followed by official denials. He was replaced by Felisa Miceli, President of Banco de la Nación Argentina (who resigned in 2007 over a money scandal, referred to by the press as toiletgate), and a former student of Lavagna's. The reasons for the forced resignation of the Minister were not made public, though speculations ranged from the failures in fighting inflation to recent Lavagna's accusations of cartelization against certain private companies involved in contracts with the government, which were seen as an indirect attack against Julio de Vido, Minister of Public Works and personally close to the President.\n\nLavagna only told the press that the President had decided his removal as part of a common post-election renewal. The next day, José Pampuro, former Minister of Defense, admitted that relations between Kirchner and Lavagna had become \"complicated\" since the elections, and that the situation was \"tense\" during the week before Lavagna's removal. Off-the-record sources also indicated that Lavagna's independence clashed with Kirchner's desire to have a homogeneous cabinet.\n\nLavagna formed a front, UNA (\"Una Nacion Avanzada\", \"An Advanced Nation\"), to run against the government's candidate, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, in the October 2007 presidential elections. Senior members of the Radical Civic Union (UCR), Socialists and Peronist supporters of former President Duhalde voiced support for a coalition behind Lavagna's candidacy, although this proved controversial in all three parties. His plan for his first 100 days of government was based on improving security and employment and reducing poverty.\n\nThe UCR endorsed Lavagna in the first election since the party's establishment in 1892 that the UCR ran in a coalition rather than field its own candidate; Gerardo Morales, leader of the UCR, was named Lavagna's running mate (Mrs. Kirchner also had a Radical as her running mate, Mendoza Governor Julio Cobos). Lavagna and UNA came third with over 3 million votes and 17%, behind Fernández and Elisa Carrió, and won solely in Córdoba Province.\n\nFollowing the 2007 election, Lavagna reached an accord with his former rivals and held talks with Néstor Kirchner over the future of the governing Justicialist Party (PJ). Lavagna was expected to become a vice-president of the Party, seen as a move to widen the base of the party and strengthen Mrs. Kirchner's government; he subsequently declared however that he would not seek a position on the PJ executive. Lavagna later became an opponent of President Fernández de Kirchner, and in 2013 co-founded \"Unidos Para Cambiar\" ('United for Change') with three leading opponents of Kirchnerism within the PJ: Córdoba Governor José Manuel de la Sota, Dissident CGT labor federation head Hugo Moyano, and Federal Peronist Congressman Francisco de Narváez.\n\n\n\n"}

From 1927 to 1936 he was Keeper of Zoology at the British Museum (Natural History) (now the Natural History Museum).\n\nHe was born in Dundee, the son of Thomas Calman, a music teacher, and Agnes Beatts Maclean.\n\nHe studied at the High School of Dundee. \n\nIn the scientific societies in Dundee, he met D'Arcy Thompson. He later became Thompson's lab boy, which allowed him to attend lectures at University College, Dundee for free. A. D. Peacock, one of Thompson's successors to the chair of Natural history at Dundee, believed this appointment came about following a letter sent by Calman in 1891 asking Thompson's advice as to applying for a post in Edinburgh. After his graduation with distinction in 1895, he took on a lecturership at the University, where he remained for eight years. When Thompson died, Calman, along with Douglas Young, wrote his obituary notice in the Royal Society of Edinburgh Yearbook.\n\nHe later worked at the Natural History Museum, where he was appointed assistant curator of Arachnida in 1904 (replacing Pocock), became assistant curator of Crustacea and Pycnogonida and Keeper of Zoology. In 1909, he wrote the Crustacea section in Lankester's \"Treatise on Zoology\", where he introduced the superorders Eucarida, Peracarida and Hoplocarida as well as the concept of the \"caridoid facies\", a hypothetical ancestral malacostracan. He wrote several of the entries about crustacea for the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition. He also established the current division of the Branchiopoda into the four orders Anostraca, Notostraca, Conchostraca and Cladocera. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1921, being the first graduate of the University of Dundee to be so. Calman retired to Tayport in 1936, but returned to teaching during the Second World War at Queen's College, Dundee and St Andrews. He was president of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1926 to 1928, president of the Linnean Society from 1934 to 1937, and was awarded the Linnean Medal in 1946.\n\nHe was awarded CB in 1935.

She showed at the Venice Biennale in 1982, becoming the first female artist to represent Australia there. In 1994 she was awarded the Order of Australia for her services to the arts.\n\nGascoigne was born Rosalie Norah King Walker in Auckland, New Zealand on 25 January 1917. She was the second of the three children of Stanley and Marion King Walker. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Auckland University in 1937. She emigrated to Canberra, Australia following her marriage to astronomer S. C. B (Ben) Gascoigne in 1943 and set up home in the isolated scientific community of Mount Stromlo. She was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in June 1994, for services to art, particularly sculpture. She died on 23 October 1999 at the John James Hospital in Canberra.\n\nDuring the many lonely years spent raising her three children, Gascoigne found solace by making natural assemblages first via traditional flower arranging then later with the rigorous Japanese art form Sogetsu Ikebana. Her work in this medium was outstanding, earning praise from Japanese master and founder of the Sogetsu School of Ikebana, Sofu Teshigahara. Nevertheless, by the late 1960s, she had become dissatisfied with the limitations of the medium and started experimenting first with small scrap iron sculptures and later wooden boxed assemblages, all composed of materials she found while on scavenging expeditions in the fierce, sunburnt landscape of Australia. While the Australian landscape was initially a shocking change from the damp green hills of her familiar New Zealand, by this time, she had come to love the \"boundless space and solitude\" of her new home. Much of her art reflects this, though some also harks back to her roots in New Zealand.\n\nShe said that her art-making materials \"need to have been open to the weather.\" She thus used mostly found materials: wood, iron, wire, feathers, and yellow and orange retro-reflective road signs; which flash and glow in the light. Some of her other best-known works use faded, once-bright drinks crates; thinly-sliced yellow Schweppes boxes; ragged domestic items such as torn floral lino and patchy enamelware; vernacular building materials such as galvanised tin, corrugated iron and masonite; and fibrous, rosy cable reel ends. These objects represent, rather than accurately depict, elements of her world. \"The countryside's discards ... no longer suggest themselves but evoke experiences, particularly of landscape.\"\n\nText is another important element of her work; she would cut up and rearrange the faded, naive lettering found on these items to create abstract yet evocative grids of letters and word fragments, sometimes alluding to the crosswords and poetry of which she was so fond. Knowledgeable and widely read, she was inspired amongst others by the artists Colin McCahon, Ken Whisson, Dick Watkins and Robert Rauschenberg, and the poets William Wordsworth, Peter Porter and Sylvia Plath. She also had a fondness for the pronouncements of Pablo Picasso. However gradually both colour and text seemed to fade from her work, and in her final years she created meditative, elegiac compositions of white or earth-brown panels.\n\nAlthough working vigorously into her 80s, with occasional help from an assistant, her age at the height of her success precluded the travelling that would have been necessary to build the international audience her work deserved. Although she exhibited occasionally overseas—including the 1982 Venice Biennale (the first Australian woman to do so), Switzerland and Sweden as well as throughout Asia (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan amongst others), the major holdings of her work remain in Australia and New Zealand, both of which claim her as their own. Fine examples of Gascoigne's oeuvre can be found in most Antipodean galleries. The Metropolitan Museum of Art owns one of her smaller pieces.\n\nThe most comprehensive book on her work to date is Martin Gascoigne's \"Rosalie Gascoigne: A catalogue raisonnè\", available to download for free at press.anu.edu.au. The most substantial exhibition catalogues are \"From the Studio of Rosalie Gascoigne\" containing memoirs and correspondence from her husband, son and studio assistants, and Kelly Gellatly's \"Rosalie Gascoigne\".

{"id": "2050237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050237", "title": "Adelaide Botanic Garden", "text": "Adelaide Botanic Garden\n\nThe Adelaide Botanic Garden is a public garden at the north-east corner of the Adelaide city centre, in the Adelaide Park Lands. It encompasses a fenced garden on North Terrace (between the old Royal Adelaide Hospital site and the National Wine Centre) and behind it the Botanic Park (adjacent to the Adelaide Zoo). Work was begun on the site in 1855, with its official opening to the public on 4 October 1857.\n\nThe Adelaide Botanic Garden and adjacent State Herbarium of South Australia, together with the Wittunga and Mt Lofty Botanic Gardens, are administered by the Board of the Botanic Gardens and State Herbarium, a State Government statutory authority.\n\nFrom the first official survey carried out for the map of Adelaide, Colonel William Light intended for the planned city to have a \"botanical garden\". To this end, he designated a naturally occurring ait that had formed in the course of the River Torrens, in what is now the West Parklands. However attempts to establish a garden were abandoned owing to frequent flooding of the area. After second attempt had failed, the northern bank of the Torrens, opposite the present location of the Adelaide Zoo, was considered, and it was here in 1839 that John Bailey, an experienced gardener, made a third attempt, but no funding was offered.\n\nThe South Australian Agricultural and Horticultural Society (formed 1842) and other groups continued to press for the creation of a public garden. The public were aware of the economic and scientific benefits of such a garden, already seen elsewhere in the British Empire. In 1854 the present site was recommended to the government by the Society and George William Francis (who had begun appealing to the Governor Sir Henry Young soon after his arrival in 1849 to establish the garden), and Francis was appointed superintendent of the garden in 1855.\n\nIn January 1855 the Legislative Council finally approved the site. The land was held sacred by the Kaurna people as the red kangaroo dreaming (\"Tarndanyangga\"), but at that time it was being used as paddocks for police horses. Francis was responsible for establishing the perimeter, solving the flooding problems and landscaping North Terrace to blend well with the entrance to the garden. In October 1855 he presented his first progress report, including a plan of Regent’s Park in London as an example of circular garden design that he thought could be adapted for Adelaide.\n\nFrancis and his family moved into the superintendent's cottage in 1856, and the Garden was opened to the public on 4 October 1857. In 1860 the \"Botanic Garden Act\" was enacted, which established the Board of Governors, with Francis as Director. The site at that time included the present Botanic Garden, Botanic Park and Adelaide Zoo.\n\nA pagoda was built in 1863, and Francis established the first herbarium and botanical library in Adelaide in 1864, a rustic temple modelled on the Museum of Economic Botany at Kew Gardens in England, with the design imitating the Parthenon in Athens. Francis gave lectures in the lecture room there each Tuesday.\n\n\"Hakea francisiana\", an Australian shrub that grows to , is named after him.\n\nAfter his retirement shortly before his death in 1865, Francis was succeeded by botanist Dr Moritz Richard Schomburgk, brother to the German naturalist Robert Hermann Schomburgk. He was a major advocate for the establishment of forest reserves in the increasingly denuded South Australian countryside.\n\nSchomburgk's successor, Dr M. W. Holtze I.S.O., did much to make the gardens more attractive to the general public.\n\nThe Palm, or Tropical, House is a Victorian-era glasshouse located to the west of the main lake. It was designed by the German architect (1822-1900) and imported from Bremen, Germany in 1875. It was opened in 1877 and was restored in 1995 and 2018. It is the second-oldest glasshouse in Australia, and the only known one of German manufacture from that period left in the world, all others having been destroyed during World War II. Originally housing tropical flora, due to corrosion problems, since the early 1990s it has held a collection of Malagasy arid flora.\n\nThe Museum of Economic Botany is dedicated to the collection and interpretation of \"useful\" plants. It was established by Schomburgk in 1879. Described as \"the last purpose-built colonial museum in the world\", it is located within the gardens a short distance to the west of the Goodman Building. Built in Greek Revival style and opened in May 1881, the building and its interior was extensively restored during 2008–09. The restoration works were assisted by a grant from the Government of Australia for $1.125 million and sponsorship by South Australian oil and gas company, Santos. The sponsorship arrangement also included naming rights and a commitment to ongoing support of the museum's exhibition program. Much of the collection originally on display in 1881 was reinstated, including a collection of papier mache and stucco replicas of various fruits and fungi. A space for temporary exhibitions within the museum was created by Khai Liew Design. Displays of Aboriginal artefacts, a subject neglected by the original museum, were prepared in collaboration with the South Australian Museum.\n\nThe museum is notable for the completeness of its preservation. The building, its interior decoration, showcases, collections and even many labels have survived from as early as 1865. The museum is on the Register of State Heritage Items, the Register of the City of Adelaide Heritage Items, and has been classified by the National Trust of Australia.\n\nThe administrative headquarters of the Botanic Garden are located in the historic Goodman building, at the Hackney Road entrance on the eastern side of the gardens. This was built in 1909 as the headquarters of the Municipal Tramways Trust, and named for its longtime Chief Engineer and General Manager W. G. T. Goodman. The adjacent Tram Barn A has been converted to hold the State Herbarium.\n\nAmong other scientific and educational displays of native and international horticulture, the gardens hold one of the earliest propagated specimens of the Wollemi Pine tree, which was discovered as recently as 1994.\n\nAs part of Adelaide's celebration of the Australian Bicentenary, the conservatory was constructed in 1987 and opened in late 1989. The building was designed by local architect Guy Maron and has won awards for its design, engineering and landscaping. It is long, wide and high making it the largest single span conservatory in the southern hemisphere.\n\nThe conservatory originally housed at-risk or endangered tropical rainforest plants from northern Australia, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and south Pacific Islands. However, in early 2012, a controversial decision was announced to remove tropical plants from the conservatory due to rising power costs. In April 2012, the entry fee to the conservatory was abolished, despite rising energy costs and budget cuts resulting in the building no longer being heated.\n\nBegun in 1996, the National Rose Trial Garden is the first garden of its kind in Australia where roses are tested for their suitability for Australian climates. The garden is a joint venture between the Botanic Gardens of Adelaide, the National Rose Trial Society of Australia and the rose industry. It has been built on part of the former Municipal Tramways Trust Hackney Depot. Roses are planted in groups such as, noisette roses, bourbon roses, tea roses, ramblers, and perpetual roses. A trial is conducted over two growing seasons and all plants are treated equally with regard to horticultural practices. The roses are judged by a panel of 10 experienced rosarians who examine them and allocate points over the two growing seasons. The results are announced publicly at the end of the trial and the best performing roses receive an award.\n\nWhile in Adelaide in 2004, Sir Cliff Richard planted a rose named 'Sir Cliff Richard' in the Rose Garden surrounded by a small group of fans and rose enthusiasts. Sales of the rose support the Bone Growth Foundation.\n\nIn order to reduce the garden's reliance on potable water from the River Murray, a new wetlands system was constructed south of the Bicentennial Conservatory to hold stormwater diverted from First Creek. The wetlands form part of an aquifer storage and recovery system which is expected to have a usable capacity of per year, enough to water the entire Botanic Garden. The project was launched in March 2011 and was opened in November 2013.\n\nOne significant purpose of the wetlands is to educate the public on the importance of wetlands, and to showcase plants which may never otherwise have been encountered by visitors. The area accommodates about 20,000 plants, including many Australian natives. The site also features a trail of interpretive signage, tiered garden beds showcasing aquatic plants and three large ponds with reed-beds which support a diverse range of native wildlife.\n\nThe Botanic Gardens of South Australia, which include Adelaide, Wittunga and Mount Lofty Botanic Gardens, and also the State Herbarium of South Australia, are administered by the Board of the Botanic Gardens and State Herbarium, a State Government statutory authority, based on the \"Botanic Gardens and State Herbarium Act 1978\" and \"Botanic Gardens and State Herbarium Regulations 2007\".\n\nDr Lucy Sutherland was appointed as the Director in 2016.\n\nThe gardens receives funding from the Government of South Australia, supplemented by sponsorship and community donations administered by the Adelaide Botanic Gardens Foundation. Funds are raised for the purposes of \"scientific research, education, acquisition and maintenance of living collections and for the long-term financial security of the Gardens.\" The Adelaide Botanic Gardens Foundation is the trustee of the not-for-profit Adelaide Botanic Gardens Foundation Fund.\n\n, the garden received support from \"program partners\" Santos and Electranet, an NFP and a private sponsor. There were also a number of supporting partners\".\n\nThe State Herbarium of South Australia publishes an open-access, peer-reviewed scientific journal on behalf of the Board of the Botanic Gardens and State Herbarium, \"Swainsona\" (2017-, Volume 30-). This was previously published as \"Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens\" (1976-2016, Volumes 1-29). The journal has a focus on Australasian taxa.\n\nThe demolition of a couple of non-heritage buildings in the old Royal Adelaide Hospital site has meant that parts of the garden need to be blocked for safety reasons. This land may be given back to the Botanic Gardens.\n\n\n"}

It is commonly called a form of Qigong, despite the differences from other Qigong methods in Zhan zhuang's orientation.\n\nThe original Zhan zhuang were health methods used by Daoists; in recent centuries, martial artists who already had static standing methods combined these with the internal mechanics of Zhan zhuang to create a superior exercise. The goal of Zhan zhuang in martial arts has always been to develop a martially capable body structure, but nowadays most practitioners have again returned to a health-preservation orientation in their training, and few teach Zhan Zhuang as a martial method.\n\nThe word \"Zhan zhuang\" is the modern term; it was coined by Wang Xiangzhai. Wang, a student of Xing Yi Quan, created a method of Kung Fu-based entirely upon Zhan zhuang, known as Yiquan, \"Intent Fist.\" Yiquan's method of study is Zhan zhuang plus movements that continue the feeling of the Standing Post in action.\n\nThe most common Zhan zhuang method is known as \"Hún Yuán\" (浑圆, \"Completely Round,\" \"Round Smoothness\") or \"Chēng Bào\" (撑抱, \"Tree Hugging\" stance). This posture is entirely Daoist in its origins, has many variations, and is the main training posture in all branches of Yiquan. This practice has recently also become common practice in Taiji and Qigong schools. In Xing Yi Quan, the practice of \"Sān Tǐ Shì\" (三體勢 / 三体势, \"Heaven, Earth, and Man\") has been a root practice for centuries.\n\nThose unfamiliar with Zhan zhuang can experience severe muscle fatigue and subsequent trembling at first. Later, once sufficient stamina and strength have been developed, the practitioner can use Zhan zhuang to work on developing the sensation of \"opposing forces,\" as well as one's central equilibrium and sensitivity to specific areas of tension in the body.\n\nZhan Zhuang has a strong connection with Traditional Chinese Medicine. Some schools use the practice as a way of removing blockages in Qi flow, believing Zhan zhuang, when correctly practiced, has a normalizing effect on the body; they claim any habitual tension or tissue shortening (or lengthening) is normalized by the practice, and the body regains its natural ability to function optimally. It is claimed that a normalized body will be less prone to muscular-skeletal medical conditions, and it is also believed that Zhan zhuang, when practiced for developing relaxed postures, will lead to a beneficial calming effect. The Dan Tian is also involved in the practice of Zhan zhuang.\n\nThe amount of time spent practicing Zhan zhuang varies between styles and schools; one may spend anywhere from two minutes to two hours standing in one posture.\n\nMany styles, especially the internal styles, combine Post Standing with Qigong training and other coordinated-body methods to develop whole-body coordination for martial purposes. The martial practice is thought to strengthen the body's Central Nervous System and develop the coordination required for effective martial performance. In Yiquan, a clear distinction is made between \"health\" postures and \"martially oriented\" postures. In Bagua Zhang's circle-walking practice, the upper body is held as a Zhan zhuang posture, while the lower body is more dynamic.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2050258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050258", "title": "Gertrude (Hamlet)", "text": "Gertrude (Hamlet)\n\nIn William Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\", Gertrude is Hamlet's mother and Queen of Denmark. Her relationship with Hamlet is somewhat turbulent, since he resents her marrying her husband's brother Claudius after he murdered the king (young Hamlet's father, King Hamlet). Gertrude reveals no guilt in her marriage with Claudius after the recent murder of her husband, and Hamlet begins to show signs of jealousy towards Claudius. According to Hamlet, she scarcely mourned her husband's death before marrying Claudius.\n\nHer name may derive from Gertrude of Bavaria, who was Queen of Denmark in the late 12th century.\n\nGertrude is first seen in Act 1 Scene 2 as she tries to cheer Hamlet over the loss of his father, begging him to stay at home rather than going back to school in Wittenberg. Her worry over him continues into the second act, as she sides with King Claudius in sending Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to raise the spirits of her son. Also, rather than ascribing Hamlet's sudden madness to Ophelia's rejection (as thought by Polonius), she believes the cause to be his father, King Hamlet's death and her quick, subsequent marriage to Claudius: \"I doubt it is no other but the main; His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.\" In Act three, she eagerly listens to the report of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern on their attempt to cheer him, and supports the King and Polonius' plan to watch Hamlet from a hidden vantage point as he speaks with Ophelia, with the hope that her presence will heal him.\n\nIn the next act, Gertrude tells Claudius of Polonius' murder, convinced that Hamlet is truly mad. She also shows genuine compassion and affection as she watches along with others as Ophelia sings and acts in absolute madness. At Ophelia's burial, she expresses her former hope that the young woman might have married her son: \"I hoped thou shouldest have been my Hamlet's wife.\" When Hamlet appears and grapples with Laertes, she asks him to stop and for someone to hold him back—saying that he may be in a fit of madness now, but that will alleviate soon. At the beginning of the play, Gertrude lies more with her husband than her son; however, after the closet scene the whole situation is switched.\n\nIn the final scene, Gertrude notices Hamlet is tired during the fight with Laertes, and offers to wipe his brow. She drinks a cup of poison intended for Hamlet by the King, against the King's wishes, and dies, shouting in agony as she falls:\n\nOther characters' views of the Queen are largely negative. When the Ghost of her former husband appears to Hamlet, he describes her as a \"seeming virtuous queen\", but orders Hamlet not to confront her about it and leave her judgement to heaven. However, his love for her while living was benevolent, as Hamlet states that his father would have held back the elements if they \"visited her face too roughly\".\n\nHamlet sees her as an example of the weakness of women (which affects his relationship with Ophelia) and constantly hurt in his reflections of how quickly (less than a month) she remarried.\n\nThere have been numerous attempts to account for Gertrude's state of mind during the play. It could be argued that as she does not confess to any sins before she dies, she did not participate in her husband's murder. However, other considerations do point to Gertrude's complicity. After repeated erratic threats towards his mother to no response, Hamlet threatens to discover the true nature of Gertrude's character by setting up a mirror, at which point she projects a killer:\n\nIn the 1919 essay \"Hamlet and his problems\" T. S. Eliot suggests that the main cause of Hamlet's internal dilemma is Gertrude's sinful behaviour. He states, \"Shakespeare's Hamlet... is a play dealing with the effect of a mother's guilt upon her son.\"\n\nIn 1924, the social reformer Lillie Buffum Chace Wyman published a study, \"Gertrude of Denmark: An Interpretive Romance\", an early attempt to give Gertrude's own perspective on her life and the events of the play. Wyman explicitly \"interrogates the nineteenth-century cult of the self-sacrificing mother\", critiquing the influence it had on interpretations of the play by both male critics and actresses playing Gertrude.\n\nIn the 1940s, Ernest Jones—a psychoanalyst and Freud's biographer—developed Freud's ideas into a series of essays that culminated in his book \"Hamlet and Oedipus\" (1949). Influenced by Jones's psychoanalytic approach, several productions have portrayed the \"closet scene\", where Hamlet confronts his mother in her private quarters, in a sexual light. In this reading, Hamlet is disgusted by his mother's \"incestuous\" relationship with Claudius while simultaneously fearful of killing him, as this would clear Hamlet's path to his mother's bed.\n\nCarolyn Heilbrun's 1957 essay \"Hamlet's Mother\" defends Gertrude, arguing that the text never hints that Gertrude knew of Claudius poisoning King Hamlet. This analysis has been championed by many feminist critics. Heilbrun argued that men have for centuries completely misinterpreted Gertrude, believing what Hamlet said about her rather than the actual text of the play. By this account, no clear evidence suggests that Gertrude is an adulteress: she is merely adapting to the circumstances of her husband's death for the good of the kingdom.\n\nWomen were almost exclusively banned from appearing as actresses on the stage until approximately 1660 and in the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods, troupes appeared that were composed entirely of boy players. Indeed, they are famously mentioned in \"Hamlet\", in which a group of travelling actors has left the city due to rivalry with a troupe of \"little eyases\" (unfledged hawks).\n\nEileen Herlie portrayed Gertrude in Laurence Olivier's 1948 \"Hamlet\".\n\nGlenn Close played mother to Mel Gibson in the Franco Zeffirelli's 1990 \"Hamlet\".\n\nJulie Christie appeared as Gertrude in Kenneth Branagh's 1996 \"Hamlet\". Despite her classical training as an actor, it was her first-ever venture into Shakespeare.\n\nIn Michael Almereyda's 2000 \"Hamlet\", Ethan Hawke plays Hamlet as a film student, while Diane Venora portrays Gertrude, wife to the former and present CEOs of \"Denmark Corporation\".\n\nIn the 2009 adaptation starring David Tennant, Gertrude is portrayed by Penny Downie.\n\nIn Ryan Imhoff's Chicago production of \"The Hamlet Project\", Gertrude is played by critically acclaimed actress Angela Morris.\n\nTabu played Gertrude who was named Ghazala in the 2014 acclaimed Bollywood adaptation of \"Hamlet\", \"Haider\".\n\nIn Heiner Müller's vanguard play \"Hamletmachine\", Gertrude is referred to \"the bitch who bore\" Hamlet.\n\nIn Giannina Braschi's political farce \"United States of Banana\", based on Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" and Pedro Calderón de la Barca's \"Life is a Dream\", a 21st-century Gertude marries the King of the United States of Banana and liberates the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo from the dungeon of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nNaomi Watts portrayed Gertrude in Claire McCarthy's 2018 \"Ophelia\".\n\n\"Gertrude and Claudius\", a John Updike novel, serves as a prequel to the events of the play. It follows Gertrude from her wedding to King Hamlet, through an affair with Claudius, and its murderous results, until the very beginning of the play. Gertrude also appears as a character in Howard Barker's \"Gertrude—The Cry\", which uses some of the characters from \"Hamlet\".\n\n\"Hamlet\" has played \"a relatively small role\" in the appropriation of Shakespeare's plays by women writers. Margaret Atwood's \"\"Gertrude Talks Back\"\", in her 1992 collection of short stories \"Good Bones\", sees the title character setting her son straight about Old Hamlet's murder: \"It wasn't Claudius, darling, it was me!\"\n\nThe character of Gemma Teller Morrow on the FX show \"Sons of Anarchy\", which incorporates plot elements from Hamlet, is influenced by and shares many traits with Queen Gertrude.\n"}

Lambert, and was developed as a medium of record for the reproduction of broadcast talks. It also previewed major literary and musical broadcasts, reviewed new books, and printed a selected list of the more intellectual broadcasts for the coming week.\n\nIts published aim was to be \"a medium for intelligent reception of broadcast programmes by way of amplification and explanation of those features which cannot now be dealt with in the editorial columns of the \"Radio Times\"\". The title reflected the fact that at the time the BBC broadcast via radio only.\n\nThe first issue was published as a four-page insert in the \"Wireless World\" magazine on 24 March 1926. \"The Listener\" was described as \"The Journal of the Wireless League\" and was edited by Prof. A. M. Low. A comment from the BBC was included: \"The B.B.C. welcomes \"The Listener\". We have always before us the need for constant progress and we gladly listen to constructive criticism and help from the large body of listeners you represent. \"The Listener\" should be a milestone in the advance of British Broadcasting.\"\n\nThe Newspaper Proprietors' Association considered its launch to be \"an illegitimate stretching of official activity\" and, after consultation between Reith and the Prime Minister, a number of compromises were agreed to, including an upper limit of 10% original contributed material not related to broadcasting. Another compromise was a limit to the amount of advertising it could carry.\n\nIt came to be seen as one of a trio of weekly magazines, the other two being \"The Spectator\" and the \"New Statesman\", though it was distinguished from them by not being associated with a political party. The management of the other two magazines were occasionally critical of what they saw as the privileged financial position of their subsidised rival.\n\nAbove all, \"The Listener\" represented the BBC's cultural mission (strongly emphasised by John Reith). It gradually declined after 1960 as British society changed, the BBC became more plural, and other sources of information became more readily available.\n\nThe first editor, Richard S. Lambert, left in 1939 after successfully suing Sir Cecil Levita for slander over allegations that he was unfit for his job because of his credulity in believing in Gef, the talking mongoose.\n\nFollowing the report of the Peacock Committee in 1986, all the BBC’s commercial activities, including \"The Listener\", were moved into BBC Enterprises Limited. Management was now mainly answerable for the magazine’s commercial performance rather than its literary standards.\n\nIn 1987 \"The Listener\" was spun out to a new company jointly owned by the BBC and rival broadcaster ITV. Seeing \"The Listener\"’s eclecticism as a lack of focus, the new company appointed Alan Coren from \"Punch\" as editor in 1987 to try to establish a clearer identity as a humorous weekly, moving slightly away from the more intellectual and artistic aspects for which the magazine had also been known.\n\nThe attempt did not work, perhaps because the change of direction alienated subscribers who had valued the eclecticism, and the company replaced Coren with Peter Fiddick in 1989. In 1990 ITV pulled out of the joint deal, the BBC found itself unable to support it on its own, and the last issue of \"The Listener\" was published in January 1991.\n\nIn 2011 the magazines were scanned for digitally preserved archiving. Issues are available via the educational publisher Gale, behind a paywall.\n\nIn its early decades \"The Listener\" attracted celebrated contributors including H. E. Bates, E. M. Forster, T. S. Eliot, Julian Huxley, George Orwell, Bertrand Russell, George Bernard Shaw, Virginia Woolf, G. K. Chesterton, Herbert Read, Hans Keller and John Kenneth Galbraith. It also provided an important platform for new writers and poets. W. H. Auden, Edwin Muir, Christopher Isherwood, Stephen Spender, Sylvia Plath and Philip Larkin all had early works published in \"The Listener\". Later, regular columnists included John Cole, Stephen Fry and Roy Hattersley. Barry Fantoni provided the magazine with cartoons and illustrations for twenty-one years.\n\n\"The Listener\" crossword puzzle, introduced in 1930, is generally regarded as the most difficult cryptic crossword to appear in a national weekly. It survived the closure of \"The Listener\" and now appears in \"The Times\" on a Saturday, along with other puzzles and game articles on the last four pages of the \"Saturday Review\" section.\n\nSolvers are invited to send in their solutions, with each of three randomly drawn correct solutions winning a prize of a book provided by the sponsors, Chambers. An annual list of statistics is also compiled for regular solvers to compare their performances. In most years only a handful of solvers are able to complete and submit all 52 puzzles correctly. The leading solver each year is awarded the Solver Silver Salver, and the all-correct solvers vote for the best puzzle of the year — the setter of which is awarded the Ascot Gold Cup.\n\n\nArts and literary editors included J. R. Ackerley 1935–1959, and Anthony Thwaite.\nAssistant Editors included Janet Adam Smith 1930–1935.\n\n"}

The reason is that such an operation is actually implemented as multiple machine instructions:\n\n\nWhen one process is doing and another is doing concurrently, there is a race condition. They might both fetch and operate on that, then both store their results with the effect that one overwrites the other and the stored value becomes either or , not as might be expected.\n\nIn uniprocessor systems with no kernel preemption supported, it is sufficient to disable interrupts before accessing a critical section.\nHowever, in multiprocessor systems (even with interrupts disabled) two or more processors could be attempting to access the same memory at the same time. The fetch-and-add instruction allows any processor to atomically increment a value in memory, preventing such multiple processor collisions.\n\nMaurice Herlihy (1991) proved that fetch-and-add has a finite consensus number, in contrast to the compare-and-swap operation. The fetch-and-add operation can solve the wait-free consensus problem for no more than two concurrent processes.\n\nThe fetch-and-add instruction behaves like the following function. Crucially, the entire function is executed atomically: no process can interrupt the function mid-execution and hence see a state that only exists during the execution of the function. This code only serves to help explain the behaviour of fetch-and-add; atomicity requires explicit hardware support and hence can not be implemented as a simple high level function.\n\nTo implement a mutual exclusion lock, we define the operation FetchAndIncrement, which is equivalent to FetchAndAdd with inc=1.\nWith this operation, a mutual exclusion lock can be implemented using the ticket lock algorithm as:\n\nThese routines provide a mutual-exclusion lock when following conditions are met:\n\nAn atomic function appears in the C++11 standard. It is available as a proprietary extension to C in the Itanium ABI specification, and (with the same syntax) in GCC.\n\nIn the x86 architecture, the instruction ADD with the destination operand specifying a memory location is a fetch-and-add instruction that has been there since the 8086 (it just wasn't called that then), and with the LOCK prefix, is atomic across multiple processors. However, it could not return the original value of the memory location (though it returned some flags) until the 486 introduced the XADD instruction.\n\nThe following is a C implementation for the GCC compiler, for both 32 and 64 bit x86 Intel platforms, based on extended asm syntax:\n\nfetch-and-add was introduced by the Ultracomputer project, which also produced a multiprocessor supporting fetch-and-add and containing custom vlsi switches that were able to combine concurrent memory references (including fetch-and-adds) to prevent them from serializing at the memory module containing the destination operand.\n\n"}

Dharma Yukam is described in the Akilam seventeen in Akilathirattu Ammanai. It is related to Dharmic moksha and to Abrahamic heaven.\n\nAs soon as Vaikundar attained Vaikundam, he was welcomed by Devas and Narayana. Then the \"Kalai Muni\" and the \"Gnana Muni\" who witnessed the activities of Vaikundar while accompanying him narrated the events. Vaikundar was crowned by Narayana as the king to rule the fourteen worlds (lokas). Then as per Narayana they carried Vaikundar in a \" 'Ratha' \" around the \"Vaikunda Loga\" playing drums and music. They brought Vaikundar along with the \"Devas\" and the \"Muni\"s in front of Narayana.\n\nNarayana proclaimed that Vaikundar is the head of Vaikundam hereafter. Then he ordered the Devas to go to Kailash and engrave on Mount Meru that, \"\"As per the holy Agama Vaikundar is going to rule the whole worlds from today onwards.\"\" Narayana Crowned Vaikundar and gave him sovereign authority and other divine paraphernalia. Narayana, Siva and other Devas seated him on the throne.\n\nLord Vaikundar pleaded to Narayana for the uplift of his people, The Santror. Narayana replied that they would be saved from the evil of Kali and Kali Yuga and would achieve bliss and prosperity in the \"Dharma Yukam\". Until then he asked Vaikundar to adopt austerity on the throne. He stated that test the faith of the people towards him (Vaikundar), a 'false deity' would claim to be god and could perform many miracles. Afterwards, the yuga will be destroyed and the people will be saved and will be given an eternal life of bliss.\n\nLord Vaikundar realised that good people are those who suffer most while those with evil thoughts lead a happy life. He refers to the \"Agamas\" to know the time limits of this. He decided to destroy the Kali-yuga. Immediately. As Vaikundar thought of this destruction, nature started to respond, burning unwanted things and beings. The whole universe got excited due to this event. \n\nThen Vaikundar thought of creating good things. Immediately good beings such as 'good people', 'good animals' , 'good birds', 'good reptiles' and 'good plants' appeared. He ordered the ocean to wash out the bad( things immediately.\n\nKroni was brought before Vaikundar and he recounted the events that took place right from his birth. He repeated the promise once he (as Kaliyan) made that, \"\"If I tend to torture any Pandaram, I and all my means will go to hell\"\". Kroni had nothing to say and surrendered all his powers and boons. The force of illusion took hold of him and put him into the flames of the abyss where the devils resided. Then the evil force along with him went into the hell. \n\nThen Vaikundar blew the conch announcing the victory. Hearing the sound all that signaled Dharma Yukam - \"the virtue, the Sastras, the plants and trees, the reptiles and the birds, the divine women and their children\" - all gathered around Vaikundar. He blessed them and instructed them to live fearlessly. He enjoined upon them to assemble in one place, to drink from the same well, and live happily as per the values of Dharma.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2050354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050354", "title": "History of Texas", "text": "History of Texas\n\nThe recorded \"history of Texas\" begins with the arrival of the first Spanish conquistadors in the region of North America now known as Texas in 1519, who found the region occupied by numerous Native American tribes. The Native Americans' ancestors had been there for more than 10,000 years as evidenced by the discovery of the remains of prehistoric Leanderthal Lady. During the period of recorded history from A.D. 1519 to 1848, all or parts of Texas were claimed by five countries: France, Spain, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, and the United States of America as well as the confederacy during the civil war.\n\nThe first European base was established in 1680, along the upper Rio Grande river, near modern El Paso, Texas with the exiled Spaniards and Native Americans from the Isleta Pueblo during the Pueblo Revolt, also known as Popé's Rebellion, from today's northern New Mexico. In 1682, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle (1643-1687), established a French colony at Fort Saint Louis, after sailing down and exploring the Mississippi River from New France (modern Canada) and the Great Lakes. He planted this early French presence at Fort Saint Louis near Matagorda Bay, along the Gulf of Mexico coast (near modern Inez, Texas), even before the establishment of New Orleans on the lower Mississippi River. The colony was killed off by Native Americans after three years, but Spanish authorities felt pressed to establish settlements to keep their claim to the land. Several Roman Catholic missions were established in East Texas; they were abandoned in 1691. Twenty years later, concerned with the continued French presence in neighboring Louisiana, Spanish authorities again tried to colonize Texas. Over the next 110 years, Spain established numerous villages, \"presidios\", and missions in the province. A small number of Spanish settlers arrived, in addition to missionaries and soldiers. Spain signed agreements with colonizers from the United States, bordering the province to the northeast ever since their Louisiana Purchase from the Emperor Napoleon I and his French Empire (France) in 1803. When Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821, Mexican Texas was part of the new nation. To encourage settlement, Mexican authorities allowed organized immigration from the United States, and by 1834, over 30,000 Anglos lived in Texas, compared to 7,800 Mexicans.\n\nAfter Santa Anna's dissolution of the Constitution of 1824 and his political shift to the right, issues such as lack of access to courts, the militarization of the region's government (e.g., response to Saltillo-Monclova problem), and self-defense issues resulting in the confrontation in Gonzales, public sentiment in Mexican and Anglo Texans turned towards revolution. Santa Anna's invasion of the territory after putting down the rebellion in Zacatecas provoked the conflict of 1836. The Texian forces fought and won the Texas Revolution in 1835–1836.\n\nAlthough not recognized as such by Mexico, Texas declared itself an independent nation, the Republic of Texas. Attracted by the rich lands for cotton plantations and ranching, tens of thousands of immigrants arrived from the U.S. and from Germany as well. In 1845, Texas joined the United States, becoming the 28th state, when the United States annexed it. Only after the conclusion of the Mexican–American War, with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, did Mexico recognize Texan independence. Texas declared its secession from the United States in 1861 to join the Confederate States of America. Only a few battles of the American Civil War were fought in Texas; most Texas regiments served in the east. When the war ended, the enslaved African Americans were freed. Texas was subject to Reconstruction, a process that left a residue of bitterness among whites. They regained political dominance and passed laws in the late 19th century creating second-class status for blacks in a Jim Crow system of segregation and disenfranchising them in 1901 through passage of a poll tax. Blacks were excluded from the formal political system until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.\n\nCotton, ranching, and farming dominated the economy, with railroad construction after 1870 a major factor in the development of new cities away from rivers and waterways. Toward the end of the 19th century, timber became an important industry in Texas as well. In 1901 a petroleum discovery at Spindletop Hill, near Beaumont, was developed as the most productive oil well the world had ever seen. The wave of oil speculation and discovery that followed came to be known as the \"Oil Boom\", permanently transforming and enriching the economy of Texas. Agriculture and ranching gave way to a service-oriented society after the boom years of World War II. Segregation ended in the 1960s due to federal legislation. Politically, Texas changed from the virtually one-party Democratic state achieved following disenfranchisement, to a highly contested political scene, until 2000 when it was solidly Republican. The economy of Texas has continued to grow rapidly, becoming the second-largest state in population in 1994, and became economically highly diversified, with a growing base in new technology.\n\nTexas lies at the juncture of two major cultural spheres of Pre-Columbian North America, the Southwestern and the Plains areas. The area now covered by Texas was occupied by three major indigenous cultures, which had reached their developmental peak before the arrival of European explorers and are known from archaeology. These are:\n\nThe Paleo-Indians who lived in Texas between 9200 – 6000 BC may have links to Clovis and Folsom cultures; these nomadic people hunted mammoths and bison latifrons using atlatls. They extracted Alibates flint from quarries in the panhandle region.\n\nBeginning during the 4th millennium BC, the population of Texas increased despite a changing climate and the extinction of giant mammals. Many pictograms from this era, drawn on the walls of caves or on rocks, are visible in the state, including at Hueco Tanks and Seminole Canyon.\n\nNative Americans in East Texas began to settle in villages shortly after 500 BC, farming and building the first burial mounds. They were influenced by the Mississippian culture, which had major sites throughout the Mississippi basin. In the Trans-Pecos area, populations were influenced by Mogollon culture.\n\nFrom the 8th century, the bow and arrow appeared in the region, manufacture of pottery developed, and Native Americans increasingly depended on bison for survival. Obsidian objects found in various Texan sites attest of trade with cultures in present-day Mexico and the Rocky Mountains, as the material is not found locally.\n\nAs of the colonial period, Texas was largely divided between 6 culture groups. The Caddoan peoples occupied the area surrounding the entire length of the Red River. Upon contact with Europeans, they formed four collective confederacies known as the Natchitoches, the Hasinai, the Wichita & the Kadohadocho (Caddo). All four of them held some land in what is now Texas. Along the Gulf Coast region were the Atakapa tribes, with at least one Coahuiltecan tribe (a culture group primarily from Northeast Mexico) a little further west on the Rio Grande. Largely between the Rio Grande & Peco River were the Puebloan peoples, part of an extensive civilization of tribes that lived in what are now the states of Texas, New Mexico, Colorado & Utah. While the northern-most groups faced a cultural collapse due to a drought, many of the southern tribes survive to the present. North of the Pueblos were the Apachean tribes. Although commonly referred to as one, single nation, they are actually a culture group. North of the Apacheans, in the Northern Panhandle region, were the Comanches.\n\nIn the 18th century, there appears to have been some sort of war in the western part of the state whereas most of the tribes of Texas divided along a line. The Coahuiltecans, at some point, would have migrated south to merge with their sister tribes. In the 18th century, the Creek Confederacy formed on the east coast, forcing several smaller Muskogean peoples out of the state. They may have migrated to Texas & Mexico, where they were absorbed into other tribes. The Choctaw also split and one of their four subtribes, the Houma came to reside in the eastern region the state before returning to Louisiana.\n\nAfter the American Revolution, many tribes were being consistently moved to migrate further west and give up their lands to American citizens. This may have been due to the unusual circumstance that the United States still considered many of these tribes as foreign nations, but outwardly claimed the land they stood on. That being said, the main push was for new, rich farmland as the plantation-style farming on the east coast soon damaged the native soil. Many tribes in the early 19th century became fed up with these practices, choosing to migrate to Texas, which was still a part of New Spain at the time. These tribes include the Mingo Seneca, the Lenape, the Kickapoo and the Muscogee. They were initially welcomed by the locals, ignored by the Spanish and played a major role in the Texas Revolution. The Native Americans also had a heavy influence in early cowboy culture in terms of dress, cuisine & the introduction of the Lasso. However, after Texas became part of the United States, most of the native people of Texas who had not integrated into White-styled culture were pushed into Indian Territory or moved further west.\n\nThe name Texas derives from \"táyshaʼ\", a word in the Caddoan language of the Hasinai, which means \"friends\" or \"allies.\"\n\nNative Americans determined the fate of European explorers and settlers depending on whether a tribe was kind or warlike. Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops, prepare foods, and hunting methods for the wild game. Warlike tribes made life difficult and dangerous for explorers and settlers through their attacks and resistance to European conquest. Many Native Americans died of new infectious diseases, which caused high fatalities and disrupted their cultures in the early years of colonization. In the 19th century, they resisted European and American expansion, and there was frequent warfare. After the American Civil War, the United States Army was used to suppress resistance in the Indian Wars.\n\nThree federally recognized Native American tribes reside in Texas: the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas, the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas, and the Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas. A remnant of the Choctaw tribe in East Texas still lives in the Mt. Tabor Community near Overton, Texas.\n\nThe first European to see Texas was Alonso Álvarez de Pineda, who led an expedition for the governor of Jamaica, Francisco de Garay, in 1520. While searching for a passage between the Gulf of Mexico and Asia, Álvarez de Pineda created the first map of the northern Gulf Coast. This map is the earliest recorded document of Texas history.\n\nBetween 1528 and 1535, four survivors of the Narváez expedition, including Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and Estevanico, spent six and a half years in Texas as slaves and traders among various native groups. Cabeza de Vaca was the first European to explore the interior of Texas.\n\nAlthough Álvarez de Pineda had claimed the area that is now Texas for Spain, the area was essentially ignored for over 160 years. Its initial settlement by Europeans occurred by accident. In April 1682, French nobleman René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle had claimed the entire Mississippi River Valley for France. The following year, he convinced King Louis XIV to establish a colony near the Mississippi, essentially splitting Spanish Florida from New Spain.\n\nLa Salle's colonization expedition left France on July 24, 1684 and soon lost one of its supply ships to Spanish privateers. A combination of inaccurate maps, La Salle's previous miscalculation of the latitude of the mouth of the Mississippi River, and overcorrecting for the Gulf currents led the ships to be unable to find the Mississippi. Instead, they landed at Matagorda Bay in early 1685, west of the Mississippi. In February, the colonists constructed Fort Saint Louis.\n\nAfter the fort was constructed, one of the ships returned to France, and the other two were soon destroyed in storms, stranding the settlers. La Salle and his men searched overland for the Mississippi River, traveling as far west as the Rio Grande and as far east as the Trinity River. Disease and hardship laid waste to the colony, and by early January 1687, fewer than 45 people remained. That month, a third expedition launched a final attempt to find the Mississippi. The expedition experienced much infighting, and La Salle was ambushed and killed somewhere in East Texas.\n\nThe Spanish learned of the French colony in late 1685. Feeling that the French colony was a threat to Spanish mines and shipping routes, King Carlos II's Council of war recommended the removal of \"this thorn which has been thrust into the heart of America. The greater the delay the greater the difficulty of attainment.\" Having no idea where to find La Salle, the Spanish launched ten expeditions—both land and sea—over the next three years. The last expedition discovered a French deserter living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans.\n\nThe Frenchman guided the Spanish to the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had become angry that the French had taken their canoes without payment and had attacked the settlement sparing only four children.\n\nNews of the destruction of the French fort \"created instant optimism and quickened religious fervor\" in Mexico City. Spain had learned a great deal about the geography of Texas during the many expeditions in search of Fort Saint Louis. In March 1690, Alonso De León led an expedition to establish a mission in East Texas. Mission San Francisco de los Tejas was completed near the Hasinai village of Nabedaches in late May, and its first mass was celebrated on June 1.\n\nOn January 23, 1691, Spain appointed the first governor of Texas, General Domingo Terán de los Ríos. On his visit to Mission San Francisco in August, he discovered that the priests had established a second mission nearby, but were having little luck converting the natives to Christianity. The Indians regularly stole the mission cattle and horses and showed little respect to the priests. When Terán left Texas later that year, most of the missionaries chose to return with him, leaving only three religious people and nine soldiers at the missions. The group also left behind a smallpox epidemic. The angry Caddo threatened the remaining Spaniards, who soon abandoned the fledgling missions and returned to Coahuila. For the next 20 years, Spain again ignored Texas.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to convince Spanish authorities to reestablish missions in Texas, in 1711 Franciscan missionary Francisco Hidalgo approached the French governor of Louisiana for help. The French governor sent representatives to meet with Hidalgo. This concerned Spanish authorities, who ordered the reoccupation of Texas as a buffer between New Spain and French settlements in Louisiana. In 1716, four missions and a presidio were established in East Texas. Accompanying the soldiers were the first recorded female settlers in Spanish Texas.\n\nThe new missions were over from the nearest Spanish settlement, San Juan Bautista. Martín de Alarcón, who had been appointed governor of Texas in late 1716, wished to establish a way station between the settlements along the Rio Grande and the new missions in East Texas. Alarcón led a group of 72 people, including 10 families, into Texas in April 1718, where they settled along the San Antonio River. Within the next week, the settlers built mission San Antonio de Valero and a presidio, and chartered the municipality of San Antonio de Béxar, now San Antonio, Texas.\n\nThe following year, the War of the Quadruple Alliance pitted Spain against France, which immediately moved to take over Spanish interests in North America. In June 1719, seven Frenchmen from Natchitoches took control of the mission San Miguel de los Adaes from its sole defender, who did not know that the countries were at war. The French soldiers explained that 100 additional soldiers were coming, and the Spanish colonists, missionaries, and remaining soldiers fled to San Antonio.\n\nThe new governor of Coahuila and Texas, the Marquis de San Miguel de Aguayo, drove the French from Los Adaes without firing a shot. He then ordered the building of a new Spanish fort Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Los Adaes, located near present-day Robeline, Louisiana, only from Natchitoches. The new fort became the first capital of Texas, and was guarded by six cannons and 100 soldiers. The six East Texas missions were reopened, and an additional mission and presidio were established at Matagorda Bay on the former site of Fort Saint Louis.\n\nIn the late 1720s, the viceroy of New Spain closed the presidio in East Texas and reduced the size of the garrisons at the remaining presidios, leaving only 144 soldiers in the entire province. With no soldiers to protect them, the East Texas missions relocated to San Antonio.\nAlthough the missionaries had been unable to convert the Hasinai tribe of East Texas, they did become friendly with the natives. The Hasinai were bitter enemies of the Lipan Apache, who transferred their enmity to Spain and began raiding San Antonio and other Spanish areas. A temporary peace was finally negotiated with the Apache in 1749, and at the request of the Indians a mission was established along the San Saba River northwest of San Antonio. The Apaches shunned the mission, but the fact that Spaniards now appeared to be friends of the Apache angered the Apache enemies, primarily the Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai tribes, who promptly destroyed the mission.\n\nIn 1762, France finally relinquished their claim to Texas by ceding all of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River to Spain as part of the treaty to end the Seven Years' War. Spain saw no need to continue to maintain settlements near French outposts and ordered the closure of Los Adaes, making San Antonio the new provincial capital. The residents of Los Adaes were relocated in 1773. After several attempts to settle in other parts of the province, the residents returned to East Texas without authorization and founded Nacogdoches.\n\nThe Comanche agreed to a peace treaty in 1785. The Comanche were willing to fight the enemies of their new friends, and soon attacked the Karankawa. Over the next several years the Comanche killed many of the Karankawa in the area and drove the others into Mexico.\n\nIn January 1790, the Comanche also helped the Spanish fight a large battle against the Mescalero and Lipan Apaches at Soledad Creek west of San Antonio. The Apaches were resoundingly defeated and the majority of the raids stopped. By the end of the 18th century only a small number of the remaining hunting and gathering tribes within Texas had not been Christianized. In 1793, mission San Antonio de Valero was secularized, and the following year the four remaining missions at San Antonio were partially secularized.\n\nIn 1799, Spain gave Louisiana back to France in exchange for the promise of a throne in central Italy. Although the agreement was signed on October 1, 1800, it did not go into effect until 1802. The following year, Napoleon sold Louisiana to the United States. The original agreement between Spain and France had not explicitly specified the borders of Louisiana, and the descriptions in the documents were ambiguous and contradictory. The United States insisted that its purchase also included most of West Florida and all of Texas.\n\nThomas Jefferson claimed that Louisiana stretched west to the Rocky Mountains and included the entire watershed of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers and their tributaries, and that the southern border was the Rio Grande. Spain maintained that Louisiana extended only as far as Natchitoches, and that it did not include the Illinois Territory. Texas was again considered a buffer province, this time between New Spain and the United States. The disagreement would continue until the signing of the 1819 Adams–Onís Treaty, at which point Spain gave Florida to the United States in return for undisputed control of Texas.\n\nDuring much of the dispute with the United States, governance of New Spain was in question. In 1808, Napoleon forced the Spanish king to abdicate the throne and appointed Joseph Bonaparte as the new monarch. A shadow government operated out of Cadiz during Joseph's reign. Revolutionaries within Mexico and the United States unsuccessfully combined to declare Texas and Mexico independent.\n\nSpanish troops reacted harshly, looting the province and executing any Tejanos accused of having Republican tendencies. By 1820 fewer than 2,000 Hispanic citizens remained in Texas. The situation did not normalize until 1821, when Agustin de Iturbide launched a drive for Mexican Independence. Texas became a part of the newly independent nation without a shot being fired, ending the period of Spanish Texas.\n\nSpanish control of Texas was followed by Mexican control of Texas, and it can be difficult to separate the Spanish and Mexican influences on the future state. The most obvious legacy is that of the language; every major river in modern Texas, including the Red River, which was baptized by the Spaniards as Colorado de Texas, has a Spanish or Anglicized name, as do 42 of the state's 254 counties. Numerous towns also bear Spanish names.\n\nAn additional obvious legacy is that of Roman Catholicism. At the end of Spain's reign over Texas, virtually all inhabitants practiced the Catholic religion, and it is still practiced in Texas by a large number of people. The Spanish missions built in San Antonio to convert Indians to Catholicism have been restored and are a National Historic Landmark.\n\nThe Spanish introduced European livestock, including cattle, horses, and mules, to Texas as early as the 1690s. These herds grazed heavily on the native grasses, allowing mesquite, which was native to the lower Texas coast, to spread inland. Spanish farmers also introduced tilling and irrigation to the land, further changing the landscape.\n\nTexas eventually adopted much of the Anglo-American legal system, but some Spanish legal practices were retained, including homestead exemption, community property, and adoption.\n\nFrom the 1750s to the 1850s, the Comanche were the dominant group in the Southwest, and the domain they ruled was known as Comancheria. Confronted with Spanish, Mexican, and American outposts on their periphery in New Mexico, Texas, and Coahuila and Nueva Vizcaya in northern Mexico, the Comanche worked to increase their own safety, prosperity and power. The population in 1810–1830 was 7,000 to 8,000.\n\nThe Comanche used their military power to obtain supplies and labor from the Americans, Mexicans, and Indians through thievery, looting and killing, tribute, and kidnappings. There was much violence committed by and against Comanche, before and after the European settlement of Texas. Although they made a living partially through raiding and violence, along with hunting/gathering, especially buffalo hunting, the Comanche empire also supported a commercial network with long-distance trade. Dealing with subordinate Indians, the Comanche spread their language and culture across the region. In terms of governance, the Comanche were nearly independent but allied bands with a loosely hierarchical social organization within bands.\n\nTheir empire collapsed when their camps and villages were repeatedly decimated by epidemics of smallpox and cholera in the late 1840s, and in bloody conflict with settlers, the Texas Rangers, and the U.S. Army. The population plunged from 20,000 to just a few thousand by the 1870s. The Comanche were no longer able to deal with the U.S. Army, which took over control of the region after the Mexican–American War ended in 1848. The long-term imprint of the Comanche on the Indian and Hispanic culture has been demonstrated by scholars such as Daniel J. Gelo and Curtis Marez.\n\nIn 1821, the Mexican War for Independence severed the control that Spain had exercised on its North American territories, and the new country of Mexico was formed from much of the lands that had comprised New Spain, including Spanish Texas. The 1824 Constitution of Mexico joined Texas with Coahuila to form the state of Coahuila y Tejas. The Congress did allow Texas the option of forming its own state \"as soon as it feels capable of doing so.\"\n\nThe same year, Mexico enacted the General Colonization Law, which enabled all heads of household, regardless of race or immigrant status, to claim land in Mexico. Mexico had neither manpower nor funds to protect settlers from near-constant Comanche raids and it hoped that getting more settlers into the area could control the raids. The government liberalized its immigration policies, allowing for settlers from the United States to immigrate to Texas.\n\nThe first empresarial grant had been made under Spanish control to Moses Austin. The grant was passed to his son Stephen F. Austin, whose settlers, known as the Old Three Hundred, settled along the Brazos River in 1822. The grant was later ratified by the Mexican government. Twenty-three other empresarios brought settlers to the state, the majority from the United States of America.\n\nStarting in 1821, and in spite of growing Mexican limitations on slavery, U.S. immigrants brought an increasing number of slaves into Texas. By 1825, 69 slave owners owned 443 slaves. Mexico granted Texas a one-year exemption from the national edict of 1829 outlawing slavery, but Mexican president Anastasio Bustamante ordered that all slaves be freed in 1830. To circumvent the law, the colonists converted their slaves into indentured servants \"for life.\" By 1836 there were 5,000 enslaved African Americans in Texas.\n\nBustamante outlawed the immigration of United States citizens to Texas in 1830. Several new presidios were established in the region to monitor immigration and customs practices. The new laws also called for the enforcement of customs duties, angering both native Mexican citizens (\"Tejanos\") and Anglos. In 1832, a group of men led a revolt against customs enforcement in Anahuac. These Anahuac Disturbances coincided with a revolt in Mexico against the current president. Texans sided with the federalists against the current government and after the Battle of Nacogdoches, drove all Mexican soldiers out of East Texas.\n\nTexans took advantage of the lack of oversight to agitate for more political freedom, resulting in the Convention of 1832. Among other issues, the convention demanded that U.S. citizens be allowed to immigrate into Texas, and requested independent statehood for the area. The following year, Texians reiterated their demands at the Convention of 1833. After presenting their petition, courier Stephen F. Austin was jailed for the next two years in Mexico City on suspicion of treason. Although Mexico implemented several measures to appease the colonists, President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna's measures to transform Mexico from a federalist to a centralist state provided an excuse for the Texan colonists to revolt.\n\nThe vague unrest erupted into armed conflict on October 2, 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales, when Texans repelled a Mexican attempt to retake a small cannon. This launched the Texas Revolution, and over the next three months, the Texian Army successfully defeated all Mexican troops in the region.\n\nOn March 2, 1836, Texans signed the Texas Declaration of Independence at Washington-on-the-Brazos, effectively creating the Republic of Texas. The revolt was justified as necessary to protect basic rights and because Mexico had annulled the federal pact. The majority of the colonists were from the United States; they said that Mexico had invited them to move to the country, but they were determined \"to enjoy\" the republican institutions to which they were accustomed in their native land.\n\nMany of the Texas settlers believed the war to be over and left the army after the initial string of victories. The remaining troops were largely recently arrived adventurers from the United States; according to historian Alwyn Barr, the numerous American volunteers \"contributed to the Mexican view that Texan opposition stemmed from outside influences.\" The Mexican congress responded to this perceived threat by authorizing the execution of any foreigner found fighting in Texas; they did not want prisoners of war.\n\nAs early as October 27, Mexican president Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna had been preparing to quell the unrest in Texas. In early 1836, Santa Anna personally led a 6,000-man force toward Texas. His force was large but ill-trained. Santa Anna led the bulk of the troops to San Antonio de Bexar to besiege the Alamo Mission, while General Jose de Urrea led the remaining troops up the coast of Texas. Urrea's forces soon defeated all the Texian resistance along the coast, culminating in the Goliad Massacre, where they executed 300 Texian prisoners of war. After a thirteen-day siege, Santa Anna's forces overwhelmed the nearly 200 Texians defending the Alamo, and killed the prisoners. \"Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad!\" became a battle cry of the Texas Revolution.\n\nNews of the defeats sparked the Runaway Scrape, where much of the population of Texas and the Texas provisional government fled east, away from the approaching Mexican army. Many settlers rejoined the Texian army, then commanded by General Sam Houston. After several weeks of maneuvering, on April 21, 1836, the Texian Army attacked Santa Anna's forces near the present-day city of Houston at the Battle of San Jacinto. They captured Santa Anna and forced him to sign the Treaties of Velasco, ending the war.\n\nThe 1st Congress of the Republic of Texas convened in October 1836 at Columbia (now West Columbia). It overturned the Mexican prohibition of slavery, although it allowed slaveholders to free their slaves if they desired. Stephen F. Austin, known as the \"Father of Texas\", died December 27, 1836, after serving two months as Secretary of State for the new Republic. In 1836, five sites served as temporary capitals of Texas (Washington-on-the-Brazos, Harrisburg, Galveston, Velasco and Columbia) before President Sam Houston moved the capital to Houston in 1837. In 1839, the capital was moved to the new town of Austin by the next president, Mirabeau B. Lamar.\n\nInternal politics of the Republic were based on the conflict between two factions. The nationalist faction, led by Mirabeau B. Lamar, advocated the continued independence of Texas, the expulsion of the Native Americans, and the expansion of Texas to the Pacific Ocean. Their opponents, led by Sam Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful co-existence with Native Americans.\n\nAlthough Texas governed itself, Mexico refused to recognize its independence. On March 5, 1842, a Mexican force of over 500 men, led by Ráfael Vásquez, invaded Texas for the first time since the revolution. They soon headed back to the Rio Grande after briefly occupying San Antonio. 1,400 Mexican troops, led by the French mercenary general Adrian Woll launched a second attack and captured San Antonio on September 11, 1842. A Texas militia retaliated at the Battle of Salado Creek. However, on September 18, this militia was defeated by Mexican soldiers and Texas Cherokee Indians during the Dawson Massacre. The Mexican army would later retreat from the city of San Antonio.\n\nMexico's attacks on Texas intensified the conflict between the political factions in an incident known as the Texas Archive War in 1842. To \"protect\" the Texas national archives, President Sam Houston ordered them out of Austin. Austin residents, suspicious of the president's motives because of his avowed disdain of the capital, forced the archives back to Austin at gunpoint. The Texas Congress admonished Houston for the incident, and the incident would solidify Austin as Texas's seat of government for the Republic and the future state.\n\nOn February 28, 1845, the U.S. Congress narrowly passed a bill that authorized the United States to annex the Republic of Texas if it so voted. The legislation set the date for annexation for December 29 of the same year. On October 13 of the same year, a majority of voters in Texas approved a proposed constitution that specifically endorsed slavery and the slave trade. This constitution was later accepted by the U.S. Congress, making Texas a U.S. state on the same day annexation took effect (therefore bypassing a territorial phase).\n\nThe Mexican government had long warned that annexation would mean war with the United States. When Texas joined the U.S., the Mexican government broke diplomatic relations with the United States. The United States now assumed the claims of Texas when it claimed all land north of the Rio Grande. In June 1845, President James K. Polk sent General Zachary Taylor to Texas, and by October, 3,500 Americans were on the Nueces River, prepared to defend Texas from a Mexican invasion. On November 10, 1845, Polk ordered General Taylor and his forces south to the Rio Grande, into disputed territory that Mexicans claimed as their own. Mexico claimed the Nueces River—about north of the Rio Grande—as its border with Texas.\n\nOn April 25, 1846, a 2,000-strong Mexican cavalry detachment attacked a 70-man U.S. patrol that had been sent into the contested territory north of the Rio Grande and south of the Nueces River. The Mexican cavalry routed the patrol, killing 16 U.S. soldiers in what later became known as the Thornton Affair. Both nations declared war. In the ensuing Mexican–American War, there were no more battles fought in Texas, but it became a major staging point for the American invasion of northern Mexico.\n\nOne of the primary motivations for annexation was the Texas government's huge debts. The United States agreed to assume many of these upon annexation. However, the former Republic never fully paid off its debt until the Compromise of 1850. In return for $10 million, a large portion of Texas-claimed territory, now parts of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Wyoming, was ceded to the Federal government.\n\nIntensified migration to Texas after statehood raised the population to about 150,000. Societies such as the Texas Emigration and Land Company now pledged to settle colonists who would agree to constitute a militia for defense against the Indians; in return they would receive a grant of 320 acres of choice land. Most of the newcomers continued to migrate from the states of the lower South; slavery was granted legal protection by the Texas constitution of 1845. The Texas population by 1860 was quite diverse, with large elements of European whites (from the American South), African Americans (mostly slaves brought from the east), Tejanos (Hispanics with Spanish heritage), and about 20,000 recent German immigrants.\n\nThe new state grew rapidly as migrants poured into the fertile cotton lands of east Texas. \nWith their investments in cotton lands and slaves, Texas planters established cotton plantations in the eastern districts. The central area of the state was developed more by subsistence farmers who seldom owned slaves.\n\nTexas in its Wild West days attracted men who could shoot straight and possessed the zest for adventure, \"for masculine renown, patriotic service, martial glory and meaningful deaths.\"\n\nThe Germans were the largest group immigrating directly from Europe. \nAccording to the \"Handbook of Texas\" :\n\nThe first Czech immigrants started their journey to Texas on August 19, 1851, headed by Jozef Šilar. Attracted to the rich farmland of Central Texas, Czechs settled in the counties of Austin, Fayette, Lavaca, and Washington. The Czech-American communities are characterized by a strong sense of community, and social clubs were a dominant aspect of Czech-American life in Texas. By 1865, the Czech population numbered 700; by 1940 there were more than 60,000 Czech-Americans in Texas.\n\nIn the summer of 1860, a slave panic erupted in North and East Texas amid rumors of arson by slaves and abolitionists. Called the \"Texas Troubles\", between 30 and 100 blacks and whites were lynched by vigilantes. The events were used to arouse support for secession.\n\nAs part of the Cotton Kingdom, planters depended on slave labor. In 1860, 30% of the total state population of 604,215 were enslaved. In the statewide election on the secession ordinance, Texans voted to secede from the Union by a vote of 46,129 to 14,697 (a 76% majority). The Secession Convention immediately organized a government, replacing Sam Houston when he refused to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy. \n\nTexas declared its secession from the United States on February 1, 1861, and joined the Confederate States of America on March 2, 1861. With few battles in its territory, Texas was mainly a \"supply state\" for the Confederate forces until mid-1863, when the Union capture of the Mississippi River made large movements of men, horses or cattle impossible. Texas regiments fought in every major battle throughout the war. The last battle of the Civil War, the Battle of Palmito Ranch, was fought in Texas on May 12, 1865. The 2nd Texas Cavalry Battalion (U.S.) (one of only two from the state) took part.\n\nSupport for the Confederacy was perhaps weakest in Texas; Elliott estimates that only a third of the white men in early 1861 supported the Confederacy. Many unionists supported the Confederacy after the war began, but many others clung to their unionism throughout the war, especially in the northern counties, the German districts, and the Mexican areas. Local officials harassed unionists and engaged in large-scale massacres against unionists and Germans. In Cooke County, 150 suspected unionists were arrested; 25 were lynched without trial and 40 more were hanged after a summary trial. Draft resistance was widespread, especially among Texans of German or Mexican descent; many of the latter went to Mexico. Potential draftees went into hiding, Confederate officials hunted them down, and many were shot. On August 1, 1862 Confederate troops executed 34 pro-Union German Texans in the \"Nueces Massacre\" of civilians.\n\nDuring the 20th century, national historiographical trends influenced the scholarship on the Civil War in Texas. Beginning in the 1950s, historians focused on military campaigns in Texas and other areas of the Southwest, a region previously neglected. Since the 1970s, scholars have shifted their attention to South Texas, exploring how its relations with Mexico and Mexican Americans affected both Confederate and Union Civil War military operations. Also since the 1970s, the \"New Social History\" has stimulated research in war-related social, economic, and political changes. This historiographical trend is related to a growing interest in local and regional history.\n\nWhen news of the Emancipation Proclamation arrived in Galveston on June 19, 1865, freed slaves rejoiced, creating the celebration of Juneteenth. The State had suffered little during the war, but trade and finance had been disrupted. Angry returning veterans seized state property, and Texas went through a period of extensive violence and disorder. Most outrages took place in northern Texas; outlaws based in the Indian Territory plundered and murdered without distinction of party.\n\nPresident Andrew Johnson appointed Union General A. J. Hamilton as provisional governor on June 17, 1865. Hamilton had been a prominent politician before the war. He granted amnesty to ex-Confederates if they promised to support the Union in the future, appointing some to office. On March 30, 1870, although Texas did not meet all the requirements, Congress restored Texas to the Union.\n\nMany free blacks were able to become businessmen and leaders. Through the young Republican Party blacks rapidly gained political power. Indeed, blacks comprised 90% of the Texas Republican Party during the 1880s. Norris Wright Cuney, an African American from Galveston, rose to the chairmanship of the Texas Republican Party and even the national committeeman.\n\nLike other Southern states, by the late 1870s white Democrats regained control of the state legislature. They passed a new constitution in 1876 that segregated schools and established a poll tax to support them, but it was not originally required for voting.\n\nWithin the Republican Party the \"Lily-white movement\" emerged, a movement to wrest control of the party by whites and eliminate black influence altogether. The movement had its origins in Texas but spread across the nation. This in addition to wider efforts to restrict the influence of non-whites rapidly reversed the fortunes of the black population.\n\nRacial violence continued by whites against blacks as they enforced white supremacy. Despite this, freedmen pursued education, organized new churches and fraternal organizations, and entered politics, winning local offices. By the 1890s, more than 100,000 blacks were voting in state elections. In 1896 and 1898, Republican Robert B. Hawley was elected to Congress from the state by a plurality, when most white voters split between the Democratic and Populist parties. Democrats were determined to end competition by Republicans and Populists, and reviewed what other Southern states were doing to disenfranchise blacks and poor whites. Mississippi's new constitution of 1890 had survived a Supreme Court case, although in practice it was highly discriminatory against freedmen.\n\nMuch of Texas politics of the remainder of the 19th century centered on land use. Guided by the federal Morill Act, Texas sold public lands to gain funds to invest in higher education. In 1876, the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas opened, and seven years later the University of Texas at Austin began conducting classes.\n\nNew land use policies drafted during the administration of Governor John Ireland enabled individuals to accumulate land, leading to the formation of large cattle ranches. Many ranchers ran barbed wire around public lands, to protect their access to water and free grazing. This caused several range wars. Governor Lawrence Sullivan Ross guided the Texas Legislature to reform the land use policies.\nThe coming of the railroads in the 1880s ended the famous cattle drives and allowed ranchers to market their cattle after a short drive, and farmers move their cotton to market cheaply. They made Dallas and other cities the centers of commercial activity. Ft. Worth became the gateway to the west, via the Fort Worth and Denver Railway. However the passenger trains were often the targets of armed gangs.\n\nGovernor Lawrence Sullivan Ross had to personally intervene to resolve the Jaybird-Woodpecker War (1888-1889) among factions of Democrats in Fort Bend County; at bottom, it was a racial conflict. The majority population was black by a large margin, and had been electing county officers for 20 years. But, the white elite Democrats wanted their own people in power. Conflict became violent and the Jaybirds ordered several blacks out of town. Tensions increased and a total of seven people were killed. In the fall of 1889, the Democratic Party created \"white-only pre-primary elections,\" which in practice were the only competitive contests in the county, and thus disenfranchised the blacks. This situation lasted until the US Supreme Court ruling in \"Terry v. Adams\" (1953) declared it unconstitutional in the last of the white primary cases.\n\nUnder Jim Hogg, the state turned its attention toward corporations violating the state monopoly laws. In 1894, Texas filed a lawsuit against John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company and its Texas subsidiary, the Waters-Pierce Oil Company of Missouri. Hogg and his attorney-general argued that the companies were engaged in rebates, price fixing, consolidation, and other tactics prohibited by the state's 1889 antitrust act. The investigation resulted in a number of indictments, including one for Rockefeller. Hogg requested that Rockefeller be extradited from New York, but the New York governor refused, as Rockefeller had not fled from Texas. Rockefeller was never tried, but other employees of the company were found guilty.\n\nGalveston, the fourth-largest city in Texas and then the major port, was destroyed by a hurricane with winds on September 8, 1900. The storm created a storm surge when it hit the island, higher than any previously recorded flood. Water covered the entire island, killing between 6,000 and 8,000 people, destroying 3,500 homes as well as the railroad causeway and wagon bridge that connected the island to the mainland. To help rebuild their city, citizens implemented a reformed government featuring a five-man city commission. Galveston was the first city to implement a city commission government, and its plan was adopted by 500 other small cities across the United States.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Galveston disaster, action proceeded on building the Houston Ship Channel to create a more protected inland port. Houston quickly grew once the Channel was completed, and rapidly became the primary port in Texas. Railroads were constructed in a radial pattern to link Houston with other major cities such as Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, and Austin.\n\nBy 1900, the Dallas population reached 38,000 as banking and insurance became major activities in the increasingly white-collar city, which was now the world's leading cotton center. It was also the world's center of harness making and leather goods. Businessmen took control of civic affairs; with little municipal patronage, there was only a small role for the Democratic Party to play. The predominantly black Republican Party was essentially closed out of politics by the disenfranchisement in 1901 of most blacks through imposition of a poll tax (see below).\n\nDetermined to control politics in the state, reduce competition from Republicans and Populists, and close blacks out of politics, in 1901 the Democrat-dominated state legislature passed a poll tax as a requirement for voting. Given the economic difficulties of the times, the poll tax caused participation by African Americans, poor whites, and Mexican Americans to drop sharply, effectively disenfranchising more than one-third of the population of the state.\n\nBy the early 20th century, the Democratic Party in Texas started using a \"white primary.\" Restricting the Democratic primary to white voters was another way of closing minorities out of politics, as the primary was the only competitive contest for office in the one-party state. By 1906, the number of black voters had dropped from more than 100,000 in the 1890s to 5,000. The state also passed a law for white primaries. In 1896, 86.6% of all voters in Texas voted in the presidential election; following disenfranchisement, voter turnout in 1904 was 29.2% and in 1920 was 21.6%.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court ruled in 1923 that white primaries established by political parties were unconstitutional, in 1927 the Texas state legislature passed a bill that authorized political parties to establish their internal practices. The Democratic Party reinstated the white primary. That law survived until 1944 before another Supreme Court case ruled that it was unconstitutional. After 1944, the NAACP and other organizations worked to register black voters and participation increased. But the major disenfranchisement continued until passage in the mid-1960s of civil rights legislation, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to provide for federal oversight in areas in which historically minorities did not vote in expected numbers based on population.\n\nTexans in 1909 marked an icon of progress with the construction of the first skyscraper west of the Mississippi. The 190-foot steel-frame skyscraper was the 14-story Praetorian Building, housing the Praetorian Insurance Company. Dallas became the regional headquarters of the Federal Reserve in 1914, strengthening its dominance of Texas banking. The city had reached 260,000 population by 1929 when the effects of the Stock Market Crash hit Texas, causing a sharp drop in the prices of oil, cotton and cattle; growth came to a standstill.\n\nOn the morning of January 10, 1901, Anthony F. Lucas, an experienced mining engineer, drilled the first major oil well at Spindletop, a small hill south of Beaumont, Texas. The East Texas Oil Field, discovered on October 5, 1930, is located in east central part of the state, and is the largest and most prolific oil reservoir in the contiguous United States. Other oil fields were later discovered in West Texas and under the Gulf of Mexico. The resulting Texas Oil Boom permanently transformed the economy of Texas, and led to its most significant economic expansion after the Civil War.\n\nThe economy, which had experienced significant recovery since the Civil War, was dealt a double blow by the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. After the Stock Market Crash of 1929, the economy suffered significant reversals. Thousands of city workers became unemployed, many of whom depended on federal relief programs such as FERA, WPA and CCC. Thousands of unemployed Mexican citizens received one-way bus tickets to their home villages in Mexico.\n\nFarmers and ranchers were especially hard hit, as prices for cotton and livestock fell sharply. Beginning in 1934 and lasting until 1939, the Dust Bowl, an ecological disaster of severe wind and drought, caused an exodus from Texas and the surrounding plains, in which over 500,000 Americans were homeless, hungry and jobless. Thousands left the region forever to seek economic opportunities in California. For the majority of farmers who remained, the New Deal's Agricultural Adjustment Act was a crash program started in 1933 that in two weeks signed up cotton growers, even as agents and committeemen faced poor roads, bureaucratic delays, inadequate supplies, balking mules, and language barriers. It brought recovery by the mid-1930s, raising cotton prices by controls on how much farmers could plant.\n\nWorld War II had a dramatic effect on Texas, as federal money poured in to build military bases, munitions factories, POW detention camps and Army hospitals; 750,000 young men left for service; the cities exploded with new industry; the colleges took on new roles; and hundreds of thousands of poor farmers left for much better-paying war jobs, never to return to agriculture. Texas needed more farm workers. The Bracero Program brought in 117,000 Mexicans to work temporarily.\n\nExisting military bases in Texas were expanded and numerous new training bases were built: Texas World War II Army Airfields; Brooke Army Medical Center, Camp Mabry, Corpus Christi Army Depot, Fort Bliss, Fort Hood, Fort Sam Houston, Ingleside Army Depot, Red River Army Depot, especially for aviation training. The good flying weather made the state a favorite location for Air Force training bases. In the largest aviation training program in the world, 200,000 graduated from programs at 40 Texas airfields, including 45,000 pilots, 12,000 bombardiers, 12,000 navigators, and thousands of aerial gunners, photographers, and mechanics. Fred Allison in a study of Majors Field, the Army Air Forces Basic Flying School, at Greenville during 1942–45, shows that the base—like most military bases in rural Texas—invigorated the local economy, but also changed the cultural climate of the conservative Christian town, especially around unprecedented freedom regarding alcohol, dating and dancing, and race relations.\nThe Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant and the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant were built as part of the WWII buildup. Hundreds of thousands of American (and some allied) soldiers, sailors and airmen trained in the state. All sectors of the economy boomed as the homefront prospered.\n\nDuring WWII, Texas became home to as many as 78,982 enemy prisoners, mainly Germans; it held 15% of the total POWs in the United States. There were fourteen prisoner-of-war camps in the state. The men in the camps were put to work to supplement the local farm labor lost to the war. Though contemporary War Department officials claimed that government attempts at denazification of the prisoners were highly successful, Nazi influence upon prisons in individual camps was common for the duration of the POW program. Walker examined Nazi activities in Texas POW camps during 1943–45 and found that the military authorities had failed to eradicate the influence of Nazi leaders.\n\nPreviously a largely rural area, East Texas became more urban as workers were recruited for the oil, shipbuilding, and aircraft industries. East Texans made many contributions to the war effort, both at home and in the armed forces. High schools had patriotic programs as well, but so many teachers and older students left for the military or for defense jobs that budgets were cut, programs dropped, and the curriculum had to be scaled down. Hospitals reported a shortage of supplies and medical personnel, as many doctors and most of the younger nurses joined the services.\n\nHarmon General Hospital, one of the Army's largest, opened in Longview in November 1942 with 157 hospital buildings and a capacity of 2,939 beds. The facility was designed for the treatment of soldiers with central nervous system syphilis, psychiatric disorders, tropical illnesses, and dermatological diseases. At the end of the war, the facility was adapted for use as the campus of LeTourneau University.\n\nBaylor University, like most schools, was successful in the multiple missions of aiding national defense, recruiting soldiers, and keeping the institution operational while the war continued. Texas Tech University likewise had many roles in the war; the most famous was the War Training Service Pre-Flight program during 1943–44. It prepared Air Force pilots for full-fledged military aviation training. The efforts of Clent Breedove and M. F. Dagley, private contractors for the Civilian Pilot Training Program at the university site since 1939, with Harold Humphries as chief pilot, brought an economic boost to Lubbock. 3,750 cadets received classroom instruction and flying time. From February 1943 to January 1944, more than 2,000 women completed training at the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps Branch Number One, Army Administration School, at Stephen F. Austin State Teacher's College in Nacogdoches.\n\nNowhere were the wartime effects greater than in Houston, which in 1940 was a city of 400,000 population dependent on shipping and oil. The war dramatically expanded the city's economic base, thanks to massive federal spending. Energetic entrepreneurs, most notably George Brown, James Elkins and James Abercrombie, landed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal wartime investment in technologically complex facilities. Houston oil companies moved from being refiners and became sophisticated producers of petrochemicals. Especially important were synthetic rubber and high octane fuel, which retained their importance after the war. The war moved the natural gas industry from a minor factor to a major energy source; Houston became a major hub when a local firm purchased the federally-financed Inch pipelines. Other major growth industries included steel, munitions, and shipbuilding.\n\nTens of thousands of new migrants streamed in from rural areas, straining the city's housing supply and the city's ability to provide local transit and schools. For the first time, high-paying jobs went to large numbers of women, blacks and Hispanics. The city's African-American community, emboldened by their newfound prosperity, increased its agitation for civil rights; they backed and funded the legal case of \"Smith v. Allwright\" (1944), in which the Supreme Court ruled against the latest version of the white primary in support of voting rights.\n\nThroughout East Texas, black family growth and dissolution came more rapidly than in peacetime; blacks were more mobile as an adjustment to employment opportunities. There was a more rapid shift to factory labor, higher economic returns, and a willingness of whites to tolerate the change in black economic status so long as the traditional \"Jim Crow\" social relations were maintained.\n\nBeginning in 1949, Texas was hit with a devastating drought that extended until 1957. Rainfall decreased 30 to 50 percent, while temperatures rose, killing crops, livestock, and triggering a rise of dust storms. As a result, the number of Texas farms and ranches declined by nearly 100,000, and Texas experienced a period of mass urbanization as the rural population moved to the city to rebuild their livelihoods. The state's rural population declined from more than a third of the population to a quarter. As a result, the Texas Water Development Board was created in 1957, and the state began a period of building a diverse system of water conservation plans. This included increasing access to groundwater, and creating lakes by damming rivers.\n\nOn Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, at 12:30 pm Central Standard Time (18:30 UTC), Lee Harvey Oswald, an alienated loner, assassinated President John F. Kennedy. The Texas Governor, John B. Connally, was also shot but survived. The episode caused a national outrage focused on right wing elements in Dallas that had long been hostile to Kennedy. For a half-century and more the people of Dallas still struggle with being branded as having some responsibility. The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, located where the assassin is believed to have fired the shots, has become a historic tourist site.\n\nDuring World War II the main universities like University of Texas and Texas A&M University gained a new national role. The wartime financing of university research, curricular change, campus trainee programs, and postwar veteran enrollments changed the tenor and allowed Texas schools to gain national stature.\n\nFrom 1950 through the 1960s, Texas modernized and dramatically expanded its system of higher education. Under the leadership of Governor Connally, the state produced a long-range plan for higher education, a more rational distribution of resources, and a central state apparatus that managed state institutions with greater efficiency. Because of these changes, Texas universities received federal funds for research and development during the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson administrations.\n\nBeginning around the mid-20th century, Texas began to transform from a rural and agricultural state to one that was urban and industrialized. The state's population grew quickly during this period, with large levels of migration from outside the state. As a part of the Sun Belt Texas experienced strong economic growth, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s. Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry. By 1990, Hispanics overtook blacks to become the largest minority group in the state.\n\nPrior to the mid-20th century Texas was essentially a one-party state, and the Democratic primary was viewed as \"the real election\". The Democratic Party had conservative and liberal factions, which became more pronounced after the New Deal. Additionally, several factions of the party briefly split during the 1930s and 40s.\n\nThe state's conservative white voters began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century. After this period, they supported Republicans for local and state offices as well, and most whites became Republican Party members. The party also attracted some minorities, but many have continued to vote for Democratic candidates. The shift to the Republican Party is much-attributed to the fact that the Democratic Party became increasingly liberal during the 20th century, and thus increasingly out-of-touch with the average Texas voter. As Texas was always a conservative state, voters switched to the GOP, which now more closely reflected their beliefs. Commentators have also attributed the shift to Republican political consultant Karl Rove, who managed numerous political campaigns in Texas in the 1980s and 90s. Other stated reasons included court-ordered redistricting and the demographic shift in relation to the Sun Belt that favored the Republican Party and conservatism.\n\nThe 2003 Texas redistricting of Congressional districts led by Republican Tom DeLay, was called by the \"New York Times\" \"an extreme case of partisan gerrymandering\". A group of Democratic legislators, the \"Texas Eleven\", fled the state in a quorum-busting effort to prevent the legislature from acting, but was unsuccessful. The state had already redistricted following the 2000 census. Despite these efforts, the legislature passed a map heavily in favor of Republicans, based on 2000 data and ignoring the estimated nearly one million new residents in the state since that date. Career attorneys and analysts at the Department of Justice objected to the plan as diluting the votes of African American and Hispanic voters, but political appointees overrode them and approved it. Legal challenges to the redistricting reached the national Supreme Court in the case \"League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry\" (2006), but the court ruled in favor of the state (and Republicans).\n\nIn the 2014 Texas elections, the Tea Party movement made large gains, with numerous Tea Party favorites being elected into office, including Dan Patrick as lieutenant governor, Ken Paxton as attorney general, in addition to numerous other candidates including conservative Republican Greg Abbott as governor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The land on which the park is located is sometimes described as a peninsula but is actually an island: the Washington Channel connects with the Tidal Basin north of the park and the Jefferson Memorial. The island is artificial: it was built up from Potomac dredging material from 1880 to 1892.\n\nIn 1920, Girl Scouts obtained permission to operate a \"tea house\" at the Hains Point Park in Washington D.C. Traveling by car was still a new adventure and the teahouse was a pleasant destination, offering refreshments and restrooms for tourists.\n\nHains Point is named in memory of Peter Conover Hains, Major General, United States Army, who is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. He designed the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C., thus solving the drainage problems and foul smell of most of the Washington area marshlands. Hains was born in 1840 and died in 1921. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point.\nHains Point was formerly known as the location of a sculpture called \"The Awakening\", which was installed at the Point in 1980. However, the sculpture was moved to the National Harbor, Maryland development on February 19, 2008.\n\nThe confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia rivers is at Hains Point. The point faces Fort Lesley McNair and the National War College, both of which are on the eastern shore of the Washington Channel, and Bolling Air Force Base, across the Anacostia River. Further northwest on the island is the Thomas Jefferson Memorial. All of these points of interest lie within the District of Columbia. To the southwest, across the Potomac in Virginia, is Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n\nHains Point and East Potomac Park are within the jurisdiction of the National Mall and Memorial Parks unit of the National Park Service. The park contains the East Potomac Golf Club and East Potomac Swimming Pool, along with a number of Washington's famous cherry trees; these trees extend well into Hains Point.\n\nThe perimeter of Hains Point and the rest of East Potomac Park is lined with a concrete walking/bike path. However, the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers often overflow their banks during high tide, covering the path with water.\n\nA straight and generally flat stretch of road extends in a loop along the perimeter of East Potomac Park, including Hains Point. This road, Ohio Drive, is one way within the park; traffic must travel clockwise, going generally northwest on the Potomac River side of the peninsula, and generally southeast on the Washington Channel side. Various cultivars of cherry trees line both sides of the road. Another road, Buckeye Drive, bisects the peninsula and connects the north and south portions of Ohio Drive within the park. Ohio Drive extends beyond the park and follows the Potomac as far as the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nAs of June 2010, East Potomac Park contains 320 parking spaces, which are accessible from both Ohio Drive and Buckeye Drive. Traffic is prohibited on weekends and some holidays on the sections of Ohio Drive between Buckeye Drive and Hains Point. This stretch of road, estimated by some as 3.2 miles (5.2 km) long (including Buckeye Drive), is a favorite of the local bicycling and inline skating community. The point and the park are also popular with other residents of the DC metropolitan area, particularly during the summer. \nThe terrain of Hains Point and East Potomac Park is flat, rising to only about .

The term “lean thinking” was coined by James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones to capture the essence of their in-depth study of Toyota's fabled Toyota Production System. Lean thinking is a way of thinking about an activity and seeing the waste inadvertently generated by the way the process is organized. It uses the concepts of:\n\n\nThe aim of lean thinking is to create a lean enterprise, one that sustains growth by aligning customer satisfaction with employee satisfaction, and that offers innovative products or services profitably while minimizing unnecessary over-costs to customers, suppliers and the environment. The basic insight of lean thinking is that if you train every person to identify wasted time and effort in their own job and to better work together to improve processes by eliminating such waste, the resulting enterprise will deliver more value at less expense while developing every employee's confidence, competence and ability to work with others.\n\nThe idea of lean thinking gained popularity in the business world and has evolved in two different directions:\n\n\nLean thinking was born out of studying the rise of Toyota Motor Company from a bankrupt Japanese automaker in the early 1950s to today's dominant global player. At every stage of its expansion, Toyota remained a puzzle by capturing new markets with products deemed relatively unattractive and with systematically lower costs while not following any of the usual management dictates. In studying the company firsthand it appeared that it had a unique group of elders (sensei) and coordinators (trainers from Japan) dedicated to help managers think differently. Contrarily to every other large company, Toyota's training in its formative years was focused on developing people's reasoning abilities rather than pushing them to execute specialist-derived systems.\n\nThese “sensei”, or masters in lean thinking would challenge line managers to look differently at their own jobs by focusing on:\n\nExperience shows that adopting lean thinking requires abandoning deeply engrained mainstream management thought routines, and this is never easy. The three main ways to adopt lean thinking are, unsurprisingly:\n\nIn the lean thinking tradition, the teacher should not explain but demonstrate – learning is the full responsibility of the learner. However, to create the proper conditions for learning the lean tradition has adopted a number of practices from Toyota's own learning curve. The aim of these practices is not to improve processes per se but to create an environment for teachable and learnable moments.\n\n\nThere are two controversies surrounding the word “lean,” one concerning the image of lean with the general public and the other within the lean movement itself.\n\nLean has repeatedly been accused of being a form of turbo-charged Taylorism, the harbinger of productivity pressure, detrimental to employee's health and autonomy at work. Unfortunately, some company programs calling themselves “lean” have indeed had a severely negative effect on the business and work relations. This problem arises when senior leaders do not seek to adopt lean thinking but instead delegate to outside consultants or internal specialist team the job of “leaning” processes. Lean thinking very clearly states that it seeks cost reductions – finding the policy origins of unnecessary costs and eliminating at the cause – and not cost cutting – forcing people to work within reduced budgets and degraded conditions in order to achieve line by line cost advantage. There is no doubt about this, but to many managers, the latter option is far more expedient than the former and it's easy to call “lean” a cost-cutting program. Nonetheless, this is not that, and any approach that doesn't have the explicit aim to develop lean thinking in every employee should not be considered to be “lean.”\n\nA second ongoing controversy, within the lean community itself, concerns how closely lean thinkers should follow Toyota practices. This is a tricky subject because on the one hand Toyota is the inventor of lean and is well ahead in both knowledge and experience but, on the other hand, why would methods invented by a Japanese auto manufacturer apply anywhere else? In fact, this debate rests on the assumption that Toyota is a monolithic company with a single unified practice. In actual terms, Toyota has changed considerably from its 1970s roots and is now a global company with hundreds of sites across all continents – no two sites are alike and although there are similar principles at work, local practices vary considerably from site to site. No one comes out of any conversation completely unchanged and, for instance, in talking to GE one comes back GE-fied as in talking to Toyota, one comes back Toyota-fied, so to speak. This debate is thus vital for the lean movement as confronting Toyota practices, such as they are here and there, to other environments is the starting point of lean thinking. In this respect, “how much like Toyota thinking should lean thinking be?” is a question without an answer that merits constant, case by case consideration.\n\nThese controversies largely emerge around the radical organizational innovation proposed by lean thinking: putting people first rather than systems. In this, lean thinking departs markedly from mainstream management:\n\nLean thinking at senior level creates leaner enterprises because sales increase through customer satisfaction with higher quality products or services, because cash improve as flexibility reduces the need for inventories or backlogs, because costs reduce through identifying costly policies that create waste at value-adding level, and because capital expenditure is less needed as people themselves invent smarter, leaner processes to flow work continuously at takt time without waste.\n\nThe importance of lean thinking goes way beyond improving business profitability. In their seminal book Natural Capitalism, authors Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and L. Hunter Lovins explicitly reference lean thinking as a way to sustain growth without so much collateral damage for the environment. Indeed, lean thinking's approach to seek to eliminate waste in the form of muri (overburden), mura (unlevelness) and muda (unnecessary resource use) is a proven practical way to attack complex problems piece by piece through concrete action. Indeed, Toyota industrial sites are well known for their sustainability efforts and well ahead of the \"zero landfill\" goal – all waste recycled within the site. Practising lean thinking offers a radically new way to look at traditional goods and service production to learn how to sustain the same benefits at a much lower cost, financially and environmentally.\n\n"}

Approximately 1000 residents attended the demonstration, which took place at 19:30 in front of the Democratic Party Headquarters in Masan. The protest sparked violent clashes between demonstrators and police officers in which several students were killed. To restore order, authorities blacked out Masan and General Carter B. Magruder eventually dispatched US Marines to quell the unrest.\n\nApril 12, 1960 – The body of Kim Ju-yul was discovered in Masan Harbor. Kim – still dressed in his uniform from Masan Commercial High School – had disappeared in the March 15 clashes. Authorities claimed that he had drowned, but many Masan residents did not believe this explanation and forced their way into the hospital where Kim's body was stored. At the hospital, they discovered that grenade fragments behind his eyes had actually killed him. In the following days, mass demonstrations broke out involving as many as 40,000 residents throughout the characteristically politically left-leaning city. During renewed clashes with police, police opened fire and killed several protesters. Once again, the US military was called in to help restore order. At this point, public anger with the government had grown to new highs and rebellion against the Rhee government mushroomed around the country. Authorities subsequently declared martial law.\n\nThus, the events in Masan in 1960 helped spark the movement against corruption known as the April 19 Movement, which eventually led to the resignation of President Syngman Rhee and the beginning of the Second Republic.\n\n1979 – Protests broke out in Masan (as well as in Busan) against the regime of President Park Chung-hee following a brutal police crackdown on a sit-in strike of female textile workers from YH Trading Company. Workers in Masan's Free-export Zone even managed to create four labour unions.\n\n2009 -\nOn December 7, the city council approved a proposal to merge Masan with Changwon and Jinhae, to form an as-then yet-to-be-named city of over one million people. The city councils of the other two cities had also approved the merger, which would bring national funds to the metropolis through a law designed to aid cities with populations of over one million. The Provincial Council of South Gyeongsang Province approved the merger, and a decision was expected to have been rendered in the penultimate week of December 2009.\n\nJuly 1, 2010 -\nThe three neighbouring cities of Masan, Changwon and Jinhae unified to create Unified Changwon City, which has a population of 1.08 million.\n\nLike most Korean cities, the city center of Masan is divided into \"administrative dong\". Outlying regions are divided into 1 \"eup\" and 4 \"myeon\":\n\n\nMasan has three institutions of higher education: public vocational focused Masan University, which is located on the northwestern outskirts of the city in Yongdam-ri, and the private Kyungnam University (경남대학교), which is located in the southern part of Masan adjacent to Shin Masan. And the small private Christian Chang Shin College, in the northeastern part of the city.\n\nThe original central business district of Masan is located in Chang-dong. But recently it has moved to Hapseong-dong. Hapseong-dong is also a commercial neighborhood. An area with many bars, restaurants, and other forms of entertainment is located in Sinmasan.\n\nMasan's baseball stadium is the home of the KBO League's NC Dinos. It previously occasionally hosted the Lotte Giants, a Korea Baseball Organization team which plays in nearby Busan. A professional women's baseball team, one of several in South Korea, plays in Sinpo-dong. An amusement park and zoo are on the tiny island of Dot-do in Masan Bay. The park is only open in the summer.\n\nMasan is also very close to Geojedo, a large island that can be reached by bus, car, or ferry.\n\nMasan is generally known for its fishing industry and is the origin of spicy Agujjim, a steamed dish made with \"agwi\" (아귀, blackmouth angler). Until the 1940s, the fish was not eaten and was frequently discarded due to its ugly appearance and low commercial value. However, as fish began to become more scarce in the late 20th century, the newly found delicacy became popular. Since its creation, \"agujjim\" has been considered a local specialty of Masan, especially around Odong-dong, one of the neighborhoods there and is favored by the public nationwide.\n\nMasan is also home of a famous fish market (locally known as \"Eosijang\"). It is located near a street with a concentration of \"agujjim\" restaurants. A municipal officer of Masan city hall stated that it is the oldest and largest fish market in Gyeongsangnam-do, even older than Jagalchi Market in Busan. \n\nConstruction of the Machang Bridge commenced in the second quarter of 2004 and opened in mid 2008. The bridge alleviates congestion in Changwon by providing a link across Masan Bay. The bridge is 1.7 kilometers long.\n\nMachang Bridge is the first large-scale bridge to be built in South Korea as a public-private partnership . The sponsors of the project, Bouygues Travaux Publics and Hyundai Engineering & Construction, had been pursuing the Project since the late 1990s. MCB Co., Ltd, the Concessionaire, is jointly owned by the sponsors and MKIF .\n\nThe port was once operated by the Mongolians (Yuan Dynasty in China) and used in the preparations to conquer Japan - which eventually failed. To this day, Masan features the small but historic \"Mongojeong\" (몽고정,蒙古井) meaning Mongol Well. It is located on Jasan-dong 117, and represents the Mongolian influence on the city.\n\nToday, Masan Port is one of the city's most dominating features. It was first opened in 1899. The port connects much of the outside world with the Changwon Industrial Complex, Masan's Free Trade Zone and the future Sachun Industrial Complex.\n\nJeodoyeonneukgyo Bridge is a popular spot to watch the beautiful sunrise and sunset. Built in 1987, the bridge connecting Gubok-ri and Jeodo Island is 182m in length and 15.5m in height. \nRocks found on both ends of the bridge extend outward toward the sea, and one can cross the bridge while enjoying the beautiful backdrop of the deep blue sea.\n\nThis park is located in the heart of Masan, with a waterwheel along a 95m-long small stream, a pine trail created with red clay, an outdoor fitness area with gym equipment, a playground for children in the forest, an outdoor performance stage, and a gateball court.\n\nThis is a mural village where people can take a walk along a winding alley, and enjoy a view of a mountain village and the Masan Port. 32 artists painted the murals without pay as part of the efforts to invigorate the communities in Chusan-dong and Seongho-dong.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2050402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050402", "title": "National Reorganization Process", "text": "National Reorganization Process\n\nThe National Reorganization Process (, often simply \"el Proceso\", \"the Process\") was the name used by its leaders for the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. In Argentina it is often known simply as última junta militar (\"last military junta\"), última dictadura militar (\"last military dictatorship\") or última dictadura cívico-militar (\"last civil-military dictatorship\"), because there have been several in the country's history.\n\nThe Argentine military seized political power during the March 1976 coup over the presidency of Isabel Perón, widow of former President Juan Domingo Perón; a time of state terrorism against civilians started, with the dictatorship labeling its own use of torture, extrajudicial murder and systematic forced disappearances as \"a Dirty War\". After starting and then losing the Falklands War to the United Kingdom in 1982, the military junta faced mounting public opposition and finally relinquished power in 1983.\n\nAlmost all of the surviving Junta members are currently serving sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide.\n\nThe military has always been highly influential in Argentine politics, and Argentine history is laced with frequent and prolonged intervals of military rule. The popular Argentine leader, Juan Perón, three-time President of Argentina, was a colonel in the army who first came to political power in the aftermath of a 1943 military coup. He advocated a new policy dubbed Justicialism, a nationalist policy which he claimed was a \"Third Position,\" an alternative to both capitalism and communism. After being re-elected to the office of president by popular vote, Perón was deposed and exiled by the Revolución Libertadora in 1955.\n\nAfter a series of weak governments, and a seven-year military government, Perón returned to Argentina in 1973, following 18 years exile in Francoist Spain, amidst escalating political unrest, divisions in the Peronist movement, and frequent outbreaks of political violence. His return was marked by 20 June 1973 Ezeiza massacre, after which the right-wing of the Peronist movement became dominant.\n\nPeron was democratically elected President in 1973, but died in July 1974. His vice president and third wife, Isabel Martínez de Perón, succeeded him, but she proved to be a weak, ineffectual ruler. A number of revolutionary organizations – chief among them \"Montoneros\", a group of far-left Peronists – escalated their wave of political violence (including kidnappings and bombings) against the campaign of harsh repressive and retaliatory measures enforced by the military and the police. In addition, right-wing paramilitary groups entered the cycle of violence, such as the \"Triple A\" death squad, founded by José López Rega, Perón's Minister of Social Welfare and a member of the P2 masonic lodge. The situation escalated until Mrs. Perón was overthrown. She was replaced on 24 March 1976 by a military junta led by Lieutenant General Jorge Rafael Videla.\n\nOfficial investigations undertaken after the end of the Dirty War by the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons documented 8,961 \"desaparecidos\" (victims of forced disappearance) and other human rights violations, noting that the correct number is bound to be higher. Many cases were never reported, when whole families were disappeared, and the military destroyed many of its records months before the return of democracy. Among the \"disappeared\" were pregnant women, who were kept alive until giving birth under often primitive circumstances in the secret prisons. The infants were generally illegally adopted by military or political families affiliated with the administration, and the mothers were generally killed. Thousands of detainees were drugged, loaded into aircraft, stripped naked and then thrown into the Rio de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean to drown in what became known as \"death flights.\"\nThe film \"The Official Story\" (1984), which won the Oscar for the Best Foreign Film category in 1985, addresses this situation. The Argentine secret service SIDE (Secretaría de Inteligencia del Estado) also cooperated with the DINA in Pinochet's Chile and other South American intelligence agencies. Eight South American nations supported endeavours to eradicate left-leaning terrorist groups on the continent, known as Operation Condor. It is estimated to have caused the deaths of more than 60,000 people. SIDE also trained – for example in the Honduran Lepaterique base – the Nicaraguan Contras who were fighting the Sandinista government there.\n\nThe regime shut down the legislature and restricted both freedom of the press and freedom of speech, adopting severe media censorship. The 1978 World Cup, which Argentina hosted and won, was used as a means of propaganda and to rally its people under a nationalist pretense.\n\nCorruption, a failing economy, growing public awareness of the harsh repressive measures taken by the regime, and the military defeat in the Falklands War, eroded the public image of the regime. The last \"de facto\" president, Reynaldo Bignone, was forced to call for elections by the lack of support within the Army and the steadily growing pressure of public opinion. On 30 October 1983, elections were held, and democracy was formally restored on 10 December with President Raúl Alfonsín being sworn into office.\n\nVidela appointed José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz as Minister of Economy, charged with stabilizing and privatizing state-owned companies, along what would later be known as neoliberal lines.\nThe Junta borrowed money abroad for public works and social welfare spending. Martínez de Hoz was forced to rely on high interest rates and an over-valued exchange rate to control inflation, which hurt Argentine industry and exports. Before the military government took office, 9% of the population lived in poverty (less than in France or the United States at that time) while the unemployment rate stood at 4.2%. The Junta's economic policies, however, led to a diminishing of living standards and an increase of inequalities.\n\nThe economic policy of the dictatorship included recipes from the International Monetary Fund, benefited a select group of monopolies and began a process of record indebtedness, which was essentially a criminal operation executed by national and foreign companies, military and economic agents , according to the judicial sentence on 13 July 2000 in the case \" \"Alejandro Olmos c / Martínez de Hoz and others s / Defraudation\" \". The level of debt rose from 7,875 million dollars at the end of 1975, to 45,087 million dollars at the end of 1983.\n\nIn 2003, French journalist Marie-Monique Robin said she had found in the archives of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs a document that proved a 1959 agreement had been made between Paris and Buenos Aires that authorized a 'permanent French military mission' being assigned to Argentina. The group was formed of soldiers who had fought in the Algerian War and dealt with insurgents. It was located in the offices of the chief of staff of the Argentine Army. She documented that Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's government secretly collaborated with Videla's junta in Argentina and with Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile.\n\nGreen deputies Noël Mamère, Martine Billard and Yves Cochet passed a resolution in September 2003 for a Parliamentary Commission to be convened on the \"role of France in the support of military regimes in Latin America from 1973 to 1984,\" to be held before the Foreign Affairs Commission of the National Assembly and presided over by Edouard Balladur. Apart from \"Le Monde\", newspapers remained silent about this request. Deputy Roland Blum, who was in charge of the Commission, refused to let Marie-Monique Robin testify.\n\nIn December 2003, his staff published a 12-page document that said no agreement had been signed between France and Argentina about military forces. But, Marie-Monique Robin had sent them a copy of the document she found showing such an agreement.\n\nWhen Minister of Foreign Affairs Dominique de Villepin traveled to Chile in February 2004, he claimed that no cooperation between France and the military regimes had occurred.\n\nSpanish judge Baltasar Garzón unsuccessfully attempted to question former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger as a witness in his investigations into the Argentine disappearances during one of Kissinger's visits to Britain, and Peter Tatchell was unable to have Kissinger arrested during the same visit for alleged war crimes under the Geneva Conventions Act.\n\nFollowing a decree of President Alfonsín mandating prosecution of the leaders of the \"Proceso\" for acts committed during their tenure, they were tried and convicted in 1985. (See \"Juicio a las Juntas\") In 1989, President Carlos Menem pardoned them during his first year in office, which was highly controversial. He said the pardons were part of healing the country. The Argentine Supreme Court declared amnesty laws unconstitutional in 2005. As a result, the government resumed trials against military officers who had been indicted for actions during the Dirty War.\n\nAdolfo Scilingo, an Argentine naval officer during the junta, was tried for his role in jettisoning drugged and naked political dissidents from military aircraft to their deaths in the Atlantic Ocean during the junta years. He was convicted in Spain in 2005 of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 640 years in prison. The sentence was later raised to 1080 years.\n\nCristian Von Wernich, a Catholic priest and former chaplain of the Buenos Aires Province Police, was arrested in 2003 on accusations of torture of political prisoners in illegal detention centers. He was convicted at trial, and on 9 October 2007, the Argentine court sentenced him to life in prison.\n\nA major trial, nicknamed \"the ESMA mega-trial\", of 63 people accused of crimes against humanity (\"lesa humanidad\") during the 1976–1983 dictatorship, including those involved in death flights, was reaching its close in July 2015. 830 witnesses and 789 victims were heard. There had been two previous trials after the Supreme Court struck down an amnesty the military dictatorship had granted its members; in the first the one accused committed suicide before a verdict was reached; in a 2009 trial twelve defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nIn December 2018, two former executives of a local Ford Motor Company plant near Buenos Aires, Pedro Muller and Hector Sibilla, were convicted for their involvement in the abduction and torture of 24 workers during the reign of the military junta. Lawyers involved in the case say this is the first time former executives of a multinational corporation operating in Argentina under the military junta have been convicted of crimes against humanity.\n\nIn 2002, the Argentine Congress declared the date of 24 March as the Day of Remembrance for Truth and Justice, in commemoration for the victims of the dictatorship. In 2006, thirty years after the coup d'état that started the \"Proceso\", the Day of Memory was declared a national public holiday. The anniversary of the coup was remembered by massive official events and demonstrations throughout the country.\n\n\nDuring the Process, there were four successive military juntas, each consisting of the heads of the three branches of the Argentine Armed Forces:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2050405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050405", "title": "Bayugan", "text": "Bayugan\n\n', officially the ', (; ), or simply known as City, is a in the province of , with postal code 8502. According to the , it has a population of people..\n\nGained cityhood through Republic Act No. 9405, it is only city in the province of Agusan del Sur. Bayugan serves as the growth center of the province.\n\nLocated at the northern part of Agusan del Sur, Bayugan is the \"cut-flower capital\" of the province owing to its lucrative cut flower industry. The city's climate, especially in the highland barangays, is conducive to high yield cut-flower production. The city is also one of the major producers of rice and vegetables in the province, even providing the needs of neighboring municipalities and provinces.\n\nThe natives called the area Bayugan since the word \"bayugan\" is a Manobo term for pathway. Another version states that \"bayug\" trees used to grow abundantly in the area. It was also believed that the natives used to make this place their meeting spot and that the means of gathering the inhabitants was by knocking on a hollow piece of wood which they termed as the \"bayug\".\n\nBayugan City was formerly a sitio of Barangay Maygatasan, Esperanza. Several versions abound on how the sitio got its name. First, the place was located along the river which served as the pathway of the natives in going to Esperanza.\n\nIn 1942, Japanese troops entered Bayugan City during the second World War.\n\nIn 1945, the town of Bayugan in Southern Agusan was liberated by Filipino soldiers and guerrillas from the Japanese forces occupying the town.\n\nIn 1948, the Department of Public Works and Highways conducted a survey for a National Highway that would connect Butuan with Davao City. Simultaneously, the Bureau of Lands surveyed the places that would be traversed by the proposed road. Possible town sites were identified and among them was Barangay Maygatasan. However, part of the National Highway (now the Narra Avenue) passed through the sitio of Bayugan instead of Barangay Maygatasan. Migrants started settling in the sitio of Bayugan, thus, prompting the transfer of the proposed town site.\n\nIn the early part of 1960, the inhabitants led by Mr. Jose Joson passed a resolution creating the sitio of Bayugan into a regular barrio. In April of that year, Barangay Bayugan was inaugurated with Joson as the Teniente del Barrio. Brought about by the construction of the National Highway which traversed the place, business activity sprouted rapidly in the area.\n\nA year later, barangay officials led by then Sergio Mullaneda worked out the creation of Bayugan into a regular municipality through the assistance of Governor Democrito O. Plaza, Governor of Agusan. By virtue of Executive Order No. 440 of then President Carlos P. Garcia, the petition to create the municipality of Bayugan was granted on August 6, 1961. Mr. Mullaneda, the first appointed Municipal Mayor of Bayugan assumed into office on August 6, 1962 during the term of President Diosdado Macapagal. In the year 2007 Bayugan was converted to a city.\n\nBayugan is a transportation highway nexus for the eastern part of Mindanao Island. Bayugan is now one if not the fastest growing component city in North Eastern Mindanao.\n\nOn July 24, 2006, congress approved R.A. 9405, an act converting the Municipality of Bayugan into a component city to be known as the City of Bayugan.\n\nBut in 2008, the Supreme Court of the Philippines declared the law unconstitutional. The court ruled that Bayugan, along with the other fifteen cities covered by the law did not meet the requirements for cityhood.\n\nMore than a year later, on December 22, 2009, acting favorably on the appeal of the sixteen affected cities, the Supreme Court reversed its earlier ruling. It deemed that the passage of the amendatory law regarding the criteria for cityhood as set by Congress specifically exempting a particular political subdivision therefrom was constitutional. The court further ruled that congress, in enacting the exempting law, effectively decreased the already codified indicators. As such, the cityhood status of Bayugan, and the rest of the fifteen local government units was restored.\n\nBut again on August 24, 2010, in a 16-page resolution, the Supreme Court reinstated its November 18, 2008 decision striking down the constitutionality of Republic Act 9405. Voting 7–6, with two justices abstaining, the SC reinstated its decision declaring RA 9405 as unconstitutional.\n\nHowever, in another twist of fate for Bayugan, the Supreme Court once again upheld for the 3rd time and final time the constitutionality of RA 9405 on February 17, 2011, thereby finalizing the cityhood of Bayugan and the other fifteen LGUs affected by the law. On July 3, 2011, the Supreme Court ordered its Clerk of Court to issue an entry of judgment on the cityhood case, sealing with finality the constitutionality of the law.\n\nBayugan is bordered by the Municipality of Sibagat and the province of Surigao del Sur to the north; the Municipality of Prosperidad to the east; the Municipality of Esperanza to the south; and the Municipality of Las Nieves, Agusan del Norte, to the west.\n\nThe city is geographically situated below the typhoon belt but is usually affected by depressions forming in the typhoon regions of Visayas and the province of Surigao del Norte. The climate map of the Philippines based on the modified coronas classification shows that the city falls under Type II. Which also is the weather classification of the province of Agusan del Sur.\n\nType II climate has no dry season with very pronounced wet season of heavy precipitation. Maximum rainfall generally occurs from December to January although there is no single dry month. Its average monthly rainfall is and average temperature is . Areas characterized by this climate type are generally along or very near the eastern coast thus are open to the north-east monsoon.\n\nBayugan is politically subdivided into 43 barangays, of which 3 are urban and 40 are rural.\n\nIndigenous people:\n\nProducts:\nFertile soil suitable for agricultural, Protection Forest About 26,107.163 Hectares = 51.697% in land classifications.

Davao Metro Shuttle, Bachelor Express, Land Car Inc., and Surigao Express are only few bus companies travelling to and from the city. Buses are serving routes from Davao City, Butuan City, Surigao City, and Mangagoy/Bislig City. Philtranco and PP Bus Line serving Pasay City/Cubao via Butuan or Davao are also available.\n\nInter-island vessels Cokaliong Shipping Lines, 2-Go and TransAsia Shipping Lines ply the Cebu-Nasipit routes on regular schedules with Nasipit Port as transit point. Multi-cabs and buses are available at the wharf going to Butuan City Integrated Terminal for the regular bus trips to Bayugan.\n\nBayugan National Comprehensive High School, or BNCHS, is a comprehensive high school with a population of about six thousand students, and is located on a site that has an area of 5 hectares. The school is currently recognized for its research program in science related topics. \"Comprehensive\" it is because it offers different curricula such as ESEP (Engineering and Science Education Program), Special Program in Journalism (pilot school for journalism in CARAGA Region), Special Program in the Arts (with the specialization of Visual Arts, Creative Writing, Dancing, Music, Media Arts and Theater Arts), Technical Vocational Courses, Special Program in Sports and Revised Basic Education Curriculum.\nAgusan del Sur College or ADSCO established in 1966, is the only private educational institution in the city offering Preparatory, Elementary, High School, College (CHED) degree courses i.e. Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) major in : Marketing Management, Financial Management, Operation Management, Bachelor of Secondary Education, Bachelor of Elementary Education, Bachelor of Arts major in English, Associate in Computer Secretarial, Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management (by year 2011) and TESDA programs like Health Care Services NC II, Computer Hardware Servicing NC II, Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW) NC II, Driving NC II, Security Services NC II, Massage Therapy NC II, Housekeeping, Commercial Cooking NC II, Bookkeeping NC II.\n\nFather Saturnino Urios College of Bayugan Inc.

By school year 2010–2011, Urios will be putting up its technical courses. The school was founded by a Jesuit priest Father Atanasio B. De Castro in 1959. The school is currently headed by Mrs. Chereil C. Martel (Principal) and Fr. Roberto Butawan (School Director).\n\n\n"}

After the storm, a Manobo woman named Bilay Ocampo was on the banks of the muddy Wawa River where she eventually found a figure where it washed up from the river. The 21-karat gold figure dating to around 850 to 950 C.E. weighs and depicts a woman sitting in the lotus position in Buddhism, is ornamented with jewelry on her body, and wears a headdress. This figure turned out to be a representation of the Bodhisattva Tara. Now known as the \"Golden Tara\", after its discovery, it was handed to the former Deputy Governor Bias Baclagon then it was passed to the Agusan Coconut Company, because of a debt. It was then being sold and was purchased for by the wife of American Governor-General Leonard Wood, Faye Cooper-Cole, who was the curator of Chicago Field Museum’s Southeast Asian department. They then donated the Golden Tara to the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois, United States where it is currently held in the Grainger Hall of Gems. Dr. H. Otley Beyer, known as the father of Philippine Archaeology and Anthropology, tried to encourage the government to buy the artifact however all attempts failed due to lack of funds.\n\nAnother historical claim has it that when Bilay Ocampo found the Golden Tara, she decided to keep it as a doll. However she was told to give it over to Baclagon because they believed it was a \"diwata\". Because of this, it was previously called \"Buwawan ni Baclagon\" or \"Ginto ni Baclagon\" (both translates to \"Gold of Baclagon\"). However, according to Bilay's granddaughter, Constancia, the Golden Tara wasn't handed over but it was stolen from her grandmother. The question of the validity of the purchase of the Golden Tara and whether it was acquired legally if it was in fact originally stolen from Bilay remains a debate of history.\n\nThe Golden Tara remains exhibited in the Grainger Hall of Chicago Field Museum (now known as the Field Museum of Natural History) up to the present time and reports has it that the Philippine government has plans to continue its negotiations in re-acquiring the figure.\n\nAccording to UP scholar Dr. Juan Francisco, he described the golden statue as, \"One of the most spectacular discoveries in the Philippine archaeological history.\"\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIn 2013, San Francisco topped first as the \"Most Competitive Municipality in the Philippines\" according to the National Competitiveness Council (NCC) from out of the 163 first-class municipalities covered by their index.\n\nThe protected area of the Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary can also be reached in San Francisco thru the Barangays Caimpugan and New Visayas.\n\nThe town is known for the gigantic Toog Tree of Alegria, which is the most sacred tribal tree for many of the indigenous peoples of San Francisco. The town is also popular for its Irosin stone crafts, which has been the cottage industry of many indigenous families in the area for hundreds of years. Due to the town's commendable folk arts and crafts made in stone, many scholars have suggested for its nomination in the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.\n\nThe town's name is sometimes colloquially shortened to \"San Franz\" or alternately spelled \"San Frans\".\n\nThe birth of San Francisco is associated with the history of Agusan and Surigao del Sur. Before San Francisco became a municipality, it was part of the District of Gibong, which was then governed by Deputy Governor Francisco Cataylo. During this period, the district comprised the \"barrio\"s of Santa Ana, Caimpugan, Ebro, Borbon, La Caridad, Prosperidad, Azpetea and Los Arcos, with Santa Ana the seat of government. Like other \"barrio\"s, Santa Ana comprised several sitios, including Sitio Hagpa, which was the site of the present day San Francisco. Hagpa was coined from a Manobo word for \"swampy\" as the sitio was a small village nestled along the Adlayan River and inhabited by Manobo tribes. \n\nThe opening of the Province of Agusan del Sur to most parts of Mindanao came during the government of President Ramon Magsaysay who ordered the first road survey to be conducted by the Department of Highway in 1952. In early 1954, road construction began paving the way for the institution of public land subdivision and the in-migration of different local tribes and settlers from the various provinces of Mindanao, Visayas and Luzon.\n\n\"Hagpa\" was later renamed \"San Francisco\" in honor of Deputy District Governor Francisco Cataylo. In early 1955, the first local government was established as San Francisco was created as a Municipal District. Francisca Tesoro Samson was appointed as the first Municipal District Mayor by then Provincial Governor Felixberto Dagani. In June 21, 1959, through \"Republic Act No. 2518\", San Francisco was officially created into a regular municipality of the Province of Agusan. In the same year, the first local officials of the municipality were elected with the Atty. Paquito Fuentes as the first elected municipal mayor, who served for three consecutive terms of office. He was succeeded by his vice mayor, Cresencio Ausmolo who stayed in office by operation of law during the latter half-portion of his last term. \n\nEight years after its creation as a regular municipality, on June 17, 1967, through \"Republic Act No. 4979\", the Province of Agusan was divided into the Provinces of Agusan del Norte and Agusan del Sur, in which San Francisco was part of the latter. The continued growth of Agusan del Sur also saw the development of the municipality of San Francisco. Its growing population later paved the way for the creation of the municipality of Rosario through \"Republic Act No. 5760\" approved by President Diosdado Macapagal on June 21, 1969, just two years after the creation of Agusan del Sur. As a result, the several \"barrio\"s of San Francisco including Bayugan III, Wasi-an, Santa Cruz, Cabawan, Cabantao, Marfil and Tagbayagan were incorporated in the newly created municipality. The \"barrio\"s of Buenasuerte, Caimpogan, Pasta, Lapinigan, Ebro, New Visayas, Bayugan II, Borbon, Tagapua, Pisaan, Santa Ana, Hubang, Alegria, San Isidro, Das-agan, Ladgadan, Lucac, Bitan-agan and Poblacion consisting of five barrios as stated in \"PD No. 86\" dated December 31, 1972, remained to form part of the 39,253-hectare Municipality of San Francisco.

They are found mostly in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. Many species are found in a very small geographic area, often even just a single river or waterfall. Because of their small range, many species are seriously threatened, especially from habitat loss (for example, due to dams flooding their habitat). Riverweeds are submerged when water levels are high, but during the dry season they live a terrestrial existence, flowering at this time. Their root anatomy is specialized for the purpose of clinging to rocks, and in fact details of the root structure are one of the ways of classifying riverweeds.\nThe Podostemaceae are related to the families Clusiaceae, Hypericaceae (the St. John's wort family, which is sometimes treated as a subfamily of Clusiaceae), and Bonnetiaceae. In the classification system of Dahlgren Podostemaceae were placed as a single family in the Podostemales order, which was the only order in the superorder Podostemiflorae (also called Podostemanae).\n\nIn many rivers, Podostemaceae are an important food source for a wide range of animals.

He worked in the diplomatic service of the Holy See from 1977 until he retired in 2001. As Archpriest of the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls from 2005 to 2009 he helped oversee important restoration work. He was made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI on 24 March 2006.\n\nMontezemolo was born in Turin, Italy of a noble family. His father Giuseppe was an Army officer, tortured and executed during the Ardeatine massacre for his role in resisting the Nazi occupation of Rome. During that year Andrea was kept hidden from the Nazis by the Ukrainian clergy in the Ukrainian Pontifical College of Saint Josaphat. Andrea and his sister Adriana have, on several occasions, been noted for their forgiveness of the perpetrators, notably Erich Priebke. He is related to Luca di Montezemolo, former president of Ferrari, former chairman of FIAT and chairman of Alitalia.\n\nMontezemolo studied in Turin and Rome and fought in World War II. After the war, he pursued higher studies in architecture and was a professional and academic. He later discerned his vocation to the priesthood and pursued studies in theology and philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian University. He also studied at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy and obtained a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Lateran University.\n\nIn 1976 he was appointed Secretary of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace in the Roman Curia. On 5 April 1977 he was appointed Titular Archbishop of Pandosia and Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Papua New Guinea and Apostolic Delegate to the Solomon Islands. On 25 October 1980 he was transferred as Apostolic Nuncio to Nicaragua and Honduras, and on 1 April 1986 to Uruguay.\n\nOn 28 April 1990 he became Apostolic Delegate to Jerusalem and Palestine and, one month later, also Pro-Nuncio to Cyprus. While he held this appointment, the 1993 Fundamental Agreement between the Holy See and the State of Israel was reached. This paved the way for establishing full diplomatic relations, so that he became the first Nuncio to Israel. In 1999 Montezemolo was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. His final diplomatic posting was as Nuncio to Italy and San Marino, to which he was named on 17 April 2001.\n\nIn 2005 he designed the coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI and shortly afterwards, on 31 May 2005, was named Archpriest of the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. As Archpriest he carried out, with the assistance of the Benedictine Monks of the Abbey of Saint Paul, important architectural work and restoration for the benefit of local Catholics and the pilgrims who come to the Basilica from various parts of the world. Pope Benedict XVI made him a cardinal in the consistory of 24 March 2006, as Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Portico. Montezemolo was already over eighty years of age and ineligible to vote in a conclave.\n\nOn 3 July 2009, Montezemolo was succeeded as Archpriest of the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls by Archbishop Francesco Monterisi, former secretary of the Congregation for Bishops.\n\nIn a 2013 interview, Montezemolo said that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI needed a new coat of arms now that he was no longer the pontiff. “The problem now is whether the Pope Emeritus can keep that same coat of arms or not”. “And as a person who has always dedicated himself to this, I say ‘no’”. He drew up a new coat of arms, which he believed could be used by the former pontiff. He moved the big keys of Saint Peter from the back of the coat of arms to the top part of the shield and made them much smaller. “But this is only a proposal, it isn’t official,” Montezemolo qualified.\n\nPope Francis visited him in a Rome nursing home in 2016.

He became physician to the English merchants in Russia, and then personal physician to the Tsar of Russia.\n\nWhile living in Russia between 1594 and 1599, he compiled two manuscript dictionaries of Russian, a Russian-English dictionary with 7,203 entries entitled and an English-Russian dictionary with 8,113 entries entitled . The Russian-English dictionary includes a short grammar of Russian on the first eight folios. Both dictionaries are now held at the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford (MSS Laud misc. 47a and 47b). After his return from Russia he also wrote two books on magnetism.\n\nThe dictionary's primary significance is in recording spoken Russian language of that era: the written language differed considerably in its vocabulary and grammar under the strong influence literary tradition of the Orthodox church texts. Thus dictionaries compiled by foreign visitors who came to Russia for business reflected the actual Russian language use that they learned through daily interaction. Whereas the written tradition can be studied using a multitude of preserved texts, the contribution of the spoken language can be studied through the records of foreign visitors who were not influenced by local stylistic and other constraints and recorded the language as it was spoken.\n\nThis thesis was realized in the works of Prof. B. A. Larin (1937, 1948, 1959) and others. The manuscript of the Ridley dictionary was originally reviewed by Simmons and Unbegaun (1951, 1962), Unbegaun (1963) from Oxford University, and later studied by a team of scholars from Kazan State University in Russia (Galiullin & Zagidullin, 1996, 1997). The manuscript was published in 1996 under the title \"A Dictionarie of the Vulgar Russe Tonge: attributed to Mark Ridley / edited from the late-sixteenth-century manuscripts and with an introduction by Gerald Stone\" by Bohlau Verlag thanks to the editorial work of Gerald Stone.\n\nThe Kazan research team in the period of 1994–2000 conducted an extensive comparative analysis of the dictionary materials in relation to the existing dictionaries of Russian language of the 16th century (to be published). These studies have confirmed the historical value of the dictionary in several aspects. The correspondence of the majority of material to the already existing records indicated the reliability of Ridley's linguistic observations. This correspondence permitted significant chronological corrections and expansion of the semantics of particular words when there were discrepancies with the major Russian historical dictionaries. Mark Ridley's dictionary also included a significant number of words or phrases never recorded before (2249 entries out of total 6975).\n\nOther studies of the Ridley dictionary were conducted by Konnova (2000), who examined its medical terminology.\n\nWhilst Ridley's Russian dictionaries are more original, he is best known as an innovative follower of Dr William Gilbert (1544–1603) and the magnetic science that Gilbert published in his \"De Magnete\" of 1600. Until Gilbert's death in 1603 Ridley had lodged with him in Wingfield House, London. In 1613 Ridley published his \"Magneticall Bodies and Motions\", the first printed work in English to promote Gilbert's ideas. Ridley was attacked by the conservative Revd William Barlow, for advancing Gilbert's Copernican astronomy and also, in Barlow's opinion, for plagiarizing his own version in English of Gilbert's magnetic science.\n\n"}

He spent two periods with Perugia (1995–98 and 1999–2001) and signed for Internazionale in 2001 for €10 million. At club level, he won a number of major honors with Inter, including five Serie A league titles in a row from 2006 to 2010, one UEFA Champions League, one FIFA Club World Cup, four Coppa Italia titles, and the Supercoppa Italiana four times.\n\nMaterazzi earned 41 caps for Italy from his debut in 2001 until 2008, playing in two World Cups and two European Championships. He was one of the key players in the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final against France, as he scored Italy's goal and later, in extra time, he received a headbutt from Zinedine Zidane, who was punished with a red card. Italy then went on to win the World Cup in a penalty shoot-out, during which Materazzi scored again.\n\nA controversial and provocative figure in football, he was known for his very physical and aggressive style of play as a defender, as well as his tight marking and strong, harsh tackling, which led him to receive more than 60 yellow cards and 25 red cards throughout his playing career. Due to his temper and his heavy challenges, he has been involved in several altercations with other players during matches, drawing comparisons with retired defender Pasquale Bruno. \"The Times\" placed Materazzi at number 45 in their list of the 50 hardest footballers in history.\n\nMaterazzi began his footballing career with the Lazio and then the Messina Peloro youth teams from 1990 to 1991. He spent his early career in the lower divisions of Italian football, with amateur side Tor di Quinto (1991–92), Serie C2 team Marsala (1993–94), and Serie C1 Trapani (1994–95), where he narrowly missed a historic promotion to Serie B after losing a promotion playoff to Gualdo. Serie B squad Perugia Calcio signed Materazzi for the first time in 1995, but he spent a part of the 1996–97 season in Serie C with Carpi.\n\nHe then spent 1998–99 with Everton, where he was sent off three times in just 27 games, and scored twice, against Middlesbrough in the league and Huddersfield Town in the League Cup.\n\nHe then returned to Perugia in 1999 and scored 12 goals, including 7 from penalties in the 2000–01 season, breaking Daniel Passarella's Serie A record of most goals by a defender in one season.\n\nMaterazzi was signed by Internazionale in July 2001 for €10 million. He took squad number 23 and made his competitive debut for the club on 26 August in the opening championship match against Perugia. Materazzi's first goal for Inter came only in his second appearance, netting inside 10 minutes in a 2–2 draw at Parma. He also played eight time in the season's UEFA Cup, with the debuting match coming on 20 September in the 3–0 win versus Romania's Brașov.\n\nMaterazzi played 23 matches in league, including the final decisive match versus Lazio which lost Inter the championship title; he was a protagonist of a controversy episode following the final whistle as he was included in a heated discussion with the opposite players which also went to physical confrontation. He was caught by the cameras shouting at Lazio captain Alessandro Nesta, saying: \"I won you the title\", in reference to Perugia's win over Juventus in 2000 which lead Lazio to the title.\n\nIn the following season, Materazzi made 33 appearances across all competitions, including 13 in UEFA Champions League, where he played his first match on 14 August 2002 in a goalless draw against Sporting CP.\n\nMaterazzi's 2003–04 season was highlighted by injuries, such as the one he suffered on 25 November during the 5–1 home loss to Arsenal in UEFA Champions League group stage which kept him out of action for two months. He was in the center of a controversy again in the beginning of 2004 for aggression towards Siena player Bruno Cirillo. This happened on 1 February in a match which was won 4–0 by Inter. Materazzi (who did not play in the match) confronted Cirillo in the dressing rooms and begun spewing insults towards him. He also punched him in the face, fracturing his lip. After the incident was denounced, the sports judge Maurizio Laudi suspended Materazzi until 29 March, meaning that he will miss eight club matches and one international match. In addition to his domestic suspension, Materazzi was also suspended by UEFA for two UEFA Cup games. Inter was also fined with €5,000. Materazzi later apologized for the incident, saying that he \"behaved badly\" and \"reacted in a bad way\", also adding that he would not appeal the suspension.\n\nIn July 2004, at the start of 2004–05 season, Inter bench was entrusted to manager Roberto Mancini, with whom – in the first season – Materazzi lost his place in the starting lineup. In the next season he played more, and was the only Italian to score a goal for the club that season. On 5 March 2006, Materazzi scored an 89th-minute header at Roma to rescue his side a point and to break the hosts' record of 11 consecutive victories. He finished the 2005–06 season by totaling 39 appearances across all competitions.\n\nMaterazzi signed a new contract in August 2006 which kept him at San Siro until June 2010. At the end of the year he was a nominee for UEFA Team of the Year along with teammate Fabio Grosso. The 2006–07 season saw him scoring 10 goals, thus being the top scoring defender of Serie A. He notably scored in the 4–3 win in Derby della Madonnina against Milan, an overhead kick versus Messina and a brace away to Siena on 23 April which won the club's 15th league title with five games remaining. For his performances, Materazzi was voted the Serie A Defender of the Year.\nMaterazzi missed the first part of 2007–08 season due to an injury suffered whilst on international duty which forced him to be sidelined until November 2007. Later in February of the following year, Materazzi gave a poor display in the first leg of 2007–08 UEFA Champions League first knockout round against Liverpool, receiving a red card in the 30th minute, as Inter lost 2–0 at Anfield. His performance was criticised by his teammates after the end of the match. Later on throughout the season, during a 2–2 draw against Siena, Materazzi argued with striker Julio Ricardo Cruz on whom to take a penalty kick. Eventually it was Materazzi who took it but his attempt was easily saved by Alex Manninger. It was his first miss since 2001. The draw spoiled Inter's chances of winning the title with one game to spare. After the match, the choice to take the penalty was criticized by manager Roberto Mancini while Materazzi himself apologized, stating that it should have been Cruz the one to take it. Inter eventually won the championship for the third consecutive time after defeating Parma 2–0 in the last matchday with Materazzi playing full-90 minutes. He concluded the season with 23 Serie A appearances, 4 Coppa Italia appearances, 1 Supercoppa Italiana appearance and 3 UEFA Champions League appearances for a total of 33 appearances.\n\nThe summer of 2008 saw the arrival of Portuguese manager José Mourinho who did not see Materazzi as the first choice in defence, relegating him to the bench. Apart from that, his season was also marred by injuries, which reduced his league tally to only 8 appearances. He scored his first UEFA Champions League goal on 4 November in a 3–3 draw at Anorthosis in the Group B matchday 4. Materazzi won his 4th championship on 17 May 2009 following Inter's 3–0 defeat of Siena. Despite playing rarely, he was still praised by president Massimo Moratti who said that Materazzi \"always played well whenever he was called upon last season\" while manager Mourinho stated that he wanted to have Materazzi in his team.\nIn June 2009, Materazzi was handed a new deal by Inter until June 2012. He was used sparingly during the 2009–10 season, making 20 appearances in all competitions. In January 2010, he underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair damage to the medial meniscus in his right knee which kept him sidelined for one month. Materazzi was an injury-time substitute for Inter in the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final against Bayern Munich, replacing Diego Milito who scored both of their goals in the 2–0 victory in Madrid. In addition to that, Inter also clinched the \"Scudetto\", for the fifth season in a row, and Coppa Italia, to complete the Treble.\n\nHe begun the 2010–11 season by coming on in the last minutes of a 3–1 home win over Roma in the Supercoppa Italiana match. Materazzi's first league match of the season came later in November where he started in the derby against Milan due to the absence of Walter Samuel; he conceded a penalty in 4th minute for fouling Zlatan Ibrahimović and was later sent to hospital after a receiving a kung-fu kick in the stomach by the Swede. Inter lost the match 1–0. Following the end of the match, manager Rafael Benítez calmed the situation by stating that Materazzi's injury \"doesn't seem serious\". He returned in action two weeks later by playing full-90 minutes in a 5–2 home win over Parma. In December, Materazzi was included in Inter's squad for 2010 FIFA Club World Cup, remaining on the bench as Inter won their 5th title of the year.\n\nMaterazzi left the club in July 2011 after not being offered a new contract, having played around 270 games for the club and winning 15 trophies, and shortly after, announced his retirement from the sport. He was later appointed in the role of ambassador to Inter. Later, Materazzi accused manager Leonardo of \"stabbing him in the back\" and being the reason for his departure from Inter, and also threw accusations to president Massimo Moratti of not having defended him against Leonardo.\n\nOn 22 September 2014, Materazzi was signed as the player-manager of Chennaiyin FC in the inaugural season of the Indian Super League. Materazzi signed a two-season contract with Chennaiyin for $1 million (USD) every season. Materazzi did not choose himself to play in their opening match, a 2–1 victory at FC Goa on 15 October courtesy of a free kick from marquee player and former Brazil international Elano. Six days later in his first home game, Chennaiyin defeated the Kerala Blasters 2–1, but four days after that he lost for the first time, 1–4 to the Delhi Dynamos. In the club's fourth match of the season, he selected himself to play for the first time, starting in a 5–1 win over Mumbai City. On 28 November, he brought his former international defensive partner Alessandro Nesta out of retirement to play for Chennaiyin until the end of the season. Chennaiyin finished the 14-game regular season in first place in the league, with Materazzi having made 6 appearances. In the end-of-season play-offs, the team were eliminated in extra time in the semi-finals by the Kerala Blasters.\n\nAt the end of the 2015 season, in which Materazzi led Chennaiyin to the Indian Super League championship, his contract ended. After the conclusion of the 2016 season, it was announced that Materazzi would not return to the club for 2017.\n\nMaterazzi made his debut for the Italy national team on 25 April 2001, in a 1–0 friendly match victory against South Africa. He made two appearances in the qualifying campaign against Georgia and Hungary. In the final tournament of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Materazzi was used as a reserve player to back up Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro. He made only one appearance by coming on as a substitute for Nesta in the 2–1 loss to Croatia in the group stage but soon in the 90th minute Materazzi played a floating ball over the top from just over half way to Inzaghi but everyone missed the ball and it rolled in the back of the net but the goal was disallowed after referee Graham Poll claimed that Inzaghi had grabbed an opponent's shirt. Materazzi was later criticised for his defending on both of Croatia's goals during the match.\n\nDespite a long suspension with Inter, Materazzi was still called up by manager Giovanni Trapattoni for the UEFA Euro 2004, where he was on the bench for Italy's first two games but started in the final group game against Bulgaria in place of the suspended Fabio Cannavaro, as Italy came from behind to win 2–1; in the first half, Materazzi was judged to have allegedly fouled Dimitar Berbatov in the area, conceding a penalty, which Martin Petrov subsequently converted. Despite the win, Italy were eliminated in the first round on direct encounters, following a three-way five point tie with Denmark and Sweden.\n\nMaterazzi played his first match as captain for Italy on 17 November 2004 in a 1–0 friendly win over Finland in which he also received a yellow card. His second and final match as captain came in another friendly against Iceland on 30 March 2005 where he played in the first half.\n\nMaterazzi was included in the 23-man squad by manager Marcello Lippi for the 2006 FIFA World Cup which was his third major tournament. He began the tournament as a reserve player, but after Alessandro Nesta suffered an injury in the group match against the Czech Republic, Materazzi came on as his replacement and made an impact by scoring a goal, and was named Man of the Match. He received a red card in the round of 16 match against Australia for a foul on Mark Bresciano, which ended in a 1–0 win for the Italians, and was suspended for the quarter-final against Ukraine, which Italy won 3–0. In the final against France, Materazzi fouled Florent Malouda to concede a penalty, which Zinedine Zidane subsequently scored. He made another impact by scoring a goal to tie the game, a header from a right sided corner by Andrea Pirlo. After the match went to extra-time, Materazzi and Zidane were involved in a confrontation in the 110th minute, where Materazzi verbally insulted Zinedine Zidane while tugging his shirt as Zidane attempted to walk away, which ended with Zidane headbutting Materazzi and receiving a red card. The game then continued to penalties. Materazzi scored Italy's second penalty as they defeated France 5–3 to claim their fourth FIFA World Cup. After the final, the confrontation resulted in a major controversy as Zidane accused Materazzi of insulting his sister and mother. Additionally, Materazzi claimed that after he had grabbed Zidane's jersey, Zidane sarcastically said to him \"\"If you want my shirt, I will give to you afterwards\"\". Materazzi then revealed that he replied, \"\"Preferisco la puttana di tua sorella\"\" (\"I would prefer your whore of a sister\"), which resulted in the headbutt. Three British tabloid newspapers, the \"Daily Star\", the \"Daily Mail\" and \"The Sun\", alleged that Materazzi had called Zidane \"\"the son of a terrorist whore.\"\" Materazzi took legal action against all three newspapers and the allegations were later withdrawn. FIFA later issued a CHF 5,000 fine and a two-match ban against Materazzi. Alongside striker Luca Toni, Materazzi was Italy's top scorer throughout the tournament with two goals; he also won 14 challenges throughout the competition. In 2010, Zidane had said that he would \"rather die than apologise\" to Materazzi for the headbutt in the final, but also admitted that he \"could never have lived with himself\" had he been allowed to remain on the pitch and help France win the match.\n\nUnder Roberto Donadoni, Materazzi appeared consistently during the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign and became a starter after Alessandro Nesta's retirement. In the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament, he started in the 3–0 loss to the Netherlands but was substituted in the 54th minute in what would later prove to be his final appearance for Italy, as he was replaced later in the tournament by Giorgio Chiellini. Later, after Lippi's return, Materazzi was not called in the national team again. He totaled 41 appearances and 2 goals for Italy.\n\nAn aggressive, physical, and hard-tackling centre-back, who was also known for his tight marking of opponents, Materazzi was considered to be one of the best defenders of his generation, and was highly regarded by two of the world's most respected coaches, Marcello Lippi and José Mourinho, later becoming close friends with both managers. Materazzi was lauded by his managers in particular for being a goal threat as a defender, due to his outstanding aerial ability, which made him dangerous during set pieces. His prolific goalscoring allowed him to capture the record for most goals in a Serie A season by a defender, which was broken during the 2000–01 season. He was also an accurate set piece and penalty kick taker, with a powerful shot from distance. In addition to these attributes, he had solid technical skills and reliable distribution, and was known for frequently playing long balls to the strikers. During his time with Internazionale, he developed the nickname \"Matrix\".\n\nMarco Materazzi was born in Lecce, where his father, Giuseppe, a professional footballer, was playing for U.S. Lecce. Giuseppe was also a former football coach and manager of teams such as Pisa, Lazio, Sporting CP and Tianjin Teda. Materazzi's mother died when he was 15 years old. His sister, Monia married Maurizio Maestrelli, the son of former manager Tommaso Maestrelli; Maurizio died on 28 November 2011. His brother Matteo is a sports agent.\n\nAs stated by his father, Marco grew up a supporter of Lazio. In September 2007, he released his autobiography called \"Una vita da guerriero\" (The Life of a Warrior) published by journalists Andrea Elefante (from \"Gazzetta dello Sport\") and Roberto De Ponti (from \"Corriere della Sera\").\n\nMaterazzi was married on 23 June 1997 to Daniela, with whom he has three children: Anna, Davide and Gianmarco.\n\nSource:\n\nSource:\n\"Italy score listed first, score column indicates score after each Materazzi goal.\"\n\nAll competitive league games (league and domestic cup) and international matches (including friendlies) are included.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The puranic name or historical name for this temple is Jayanthipuram. This temple is the fourth Hindu temple in Tamil Nadu to get ISO certification. It is located in the eastern end of the town Thiruchendur in the district of Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu, India. It is 60 km south-east of Tirunelveli, 40 km from Tuticorin and 75 km north-east of Kanyakumari. The temple complex is on the shores of Bay of Bengal. Temple is open from 5 AM to 9 PM\n\nTiruchendur Murugan Temple is an ancient Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Muruga at the site of the battle. It is one of the six major abodes, or sacred temples, of the Kaumaram religion. Soorasamharam, a reenactment of the victory over Soorapadman, and Kanda Shasti, a devotional song in praise of Lord Muruga are performed at the temple.\n\nTiruchendur means sacred and beautiful town in Tamil. The temple is dedicated to Murugan, the warrior deity and second son of Shiva. When Muruga came here for the conquest along with his army, he found it to be very small and ordered the celestial architect Viswakarma to expand it. The town came to be know with several names like Tiruchendil, Jayanthipuram, Thiruchilavay and Srisandhinagaram. It is believed to be the place where Muruga conquered the demon Surapadma. It is believed that the demigods of Muruga wanted to worship him in a place where there was a mountainous tract, sea and river and hence Tiruchendur was chosen.\n\nIt is one of the shrines of the Vaippu Sthalams sung by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Appar. \n\nThe temple, which is built near the seashore, measures north to south, east to west, and has a nine-tier gopuram, or tower gate, that is high. The principal entrance faces south, and opens into the first of two prakarams, the first of which is lined with rows of Yalis. The inner sanctum of the temple is in a cave and the main deity, or moolavar, is Murugan as a saintly child, portrayed in a granite carving. Naazhi Kinaru, a sacred well fed by a freshwater spring, is located south of the temple. Devotees undergo a ritual cleansing by bathing in water from the well after bathing in the ocean.\n\nThe Murugan temple at Thiruchendur was occupied by the Dutch East India company from 1646 to 1648, during the course of their war with the Portuguese. The local people tried to free their temple, with no success. The Dutch finally vacated the temple on orders from the Naik ruler. However, while leaving, they removed the idol of the main deity of the temple, and took it with them. During their way in sea, they encountered a strong storm and realised their mistake of stealing the idol. They dropped the idol in the middle of the sea and seen the storm stopped immediately. Later, Lord Senthil Aandavan appeared in a dream to Vadamaliyappa Pillai, an ardent devotee of Muruga, and revealed the place in the sea where the idol had been abandoned. Vadamlaiyappa Pillai and Athitha Nadar, a sponsor of services in the Thiruchendur temple, went to the spot in a fishing boat and retrieved the idol in 1653. The story is shown in paintings inside the temple.\n\n"}

{"id": "2050454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050454", "title": "Online petition", "text": "Online petition\n\nAn online petition (or Internet petition, or e-petition) is a form of petition which is signed online, usually through a form on a website. Visitors to the online petition sign the petition by adding their details such as name and email address. Typically, after there are enough signatories, the resulting letter may be delivered to the subject of the petition, usually via e-mail. The online petition may also deliver an email to the target of the petition each time the petition is signed.\n\nThe format makes it easy for people to make a petition at any time. Several websites allow anyone with computer access to make one to protest any cause, such as stopping construction or closure of a store. Because petitions are easy to set up, the site can attract frivolous causes, or jokes framed in the ostensible form of a petition.\n\nOnline petitions may be abused if signers don't use real names, thus undermining its legitimacy. Verification, for example via a confirmation e-mail can prevent padding a petition with false names and e-mails. Many petition sites now have safeguards to match real world processes; such as local governments requiring protest groups to present petition signatures, plus their printed name, and a way to verify the signature (either with a phone number or identification number via a driver's license or a passport) to ensure that the signature is legitimate and not falsified by the protestors.\n\nThere are now several major web initiatives featuring online petitions, for example Change.org, Avaaz.org, and 38 Degrees. These are growing in popularity and ability to achieve political impact. The \"Economist\" commented that Avaaz has had \"some spectacular successes\", but raises questions about what objective measures can be used to assess \"the reach of a global e-protest movement\". Recently, several petitions on Change.org have been attributed to the reversal of a United Airlines Dog Policy.\n\nSome legitimate non-governmental organizations (NGOs) shun online petitions. Reasons include the paucity of examples of this form of petition achieving its objective. Critics frequently cite it as an example of slacktivism.\n\nIn February 2007 an online petition against road pricing and car tracking on the UK Prime Minister's own website attracted over 1.8 million e-signatures from a population of 60 million people. The site was official but experimental at the time. Shocked government ministers were unable to backtrack on the site's existence in the face of national news coverage of the phenomenon. The incident has demonstrated both the potential and pitfalls of online e-Government petitions.\n\nA similar form of petition is the e-mail petition. This petition may be a simple chain letter, requesting that its users forward them to a large number of people in order to meet a goal or to attain a falsely promised reward. Other times the usage will contain a form to be printed and filled out, or a link to an offsite online petition which the recipient can sign. Usually, the e-mail petition focuses on a specific cause that is meant to cause outrage or ire, centering on a timely political or cultural topic. E-mail petitions were among the earliest attempts to garner attention to a cause from an online audience.\n\nThe first known successful online petition was written during the summer of 1998. This was a petition to the New York Mets with the goal of re-signing catcher Mike Piazza as a free agent. Piazza had been obtained by the Mets earlier in the season and was eligible for free agency for the 1999 season. The petition was publicized through a GeoCities website, various newsgroups and emails, garnering 10,316 signatures. The petition was sent to Mike Piazza, his agents, Mets ownership and general manager Mike Phillips.\n\nA digitized copy of the petition, documentation of the petition through news articles, and a sound file of Mike Phillips announcing Piazza's signing for seven years along with his acknowledgment of the petition are available in the research files of the A. Bartlett Giamatti Research Center of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.\n\nOn 23 March 2019, the record for greatest number of verified signatures on an official government petition was broken in the UK. The petition, remaining live until August 2019, calls to ‘Revoke Article 50 and remain in the E.U.', and had over 6 million signatures by 31 March 2019. It coincided with the large national People's Vote March on the same day, also protesting against the U.K. government's decision to leave the European Union following the Brexit referendum.\n\nThe international record for most successful online petition is currently held by the Change.org petition relating to the EU Copyright directive, which has over 5.1 million signatures.\n\nWith the rise of the World Wide Web as a platform for commerce, activism and discussion, an opportunity to garner attention for various social causes was perceived by various players, resulting in a more formalized structure for online petitions; one of the first web-based petition hosts, PetitionOnline, was founded in 1999, with others such as GoPetition (founded in 2000), thePetitionSite.com, iPetitions, and others being established in the years since. Petition hosts served as accessible external locations for the creation of a wide variety of petitions for free by users, providing easier interfaces for such petitions in comparison to the previous e-mail petitions and informal web forum-based petitions. However, petition hosts were criticized for their lax requirements from users who created or signed such petitions: petitions were often only signed with false or anonymous nomenclatures, and often resulted in disorganized side commentary between signers of the same petition.\n\nThe rise of online social networking in the later 2000s, however, resulted in both an increase of Internet petition integration into social networks and an increase of visibility for such petitions; Facebook, Change.org, Care2, Avaaz.org, SumOfUs, GoPetition and other sites serve as examples of the integration of Internet petitions as a form of social media and user-generated content. Such networks may have proven to be more fertile ground for the creation of, signing of and response to online petitions, as such networks generally lack the heightened level of anonymity associated with the earlier dedicated petition hosts.\n\nIn some cases petition sites have managed to reach agreement with state institutions about the implementation mechanism of widely supported initiatives. Thus, platform ManaBalss.lv in Latvia has the authority to hand over to a national parliament any legally correct initiative which has been signed by more than 10,000 authenticated supporters. Approximately half of these initiatives have been either supported by parliament or are in the process of review.\n\nThe UK Parliament petitions website has operated in various guises since 2006. Beginning in 2011, a parliamentary committee considered holding a parliamentary debate for petitions attracting more than 100,000 signatures. In 2015, the process was formalized within Parliament and a permanent Petitions Committee was established. In the UK, the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 requires all principal authorities to provide a facility for people to submit petitions electronically.\n\nSome parliaments, government agencies and officials, such as The Scottish Parliament with the e-Petitioner system (from 1999), the Queensland Parliament in Australia, German Bundestag (from 2005), Cabinet of ministers of Ukraine (from 2016) and Bristol City Council in the U.K have adopted electronic petitioning systems as a way to display a commitment to their constituents and provide greater accessibility into government operations.\n\nThe European Parliament Committee on Petitions (PETI) is one of the permanent committees of the European Parliament to offer a petition process including a web portal to create and admit petitions. The right to petition is one of the fundamental rights of the European citizens and residents.\n\nThe US government created We The People in 2011 as a platform for creating and signing petitions on the White House web server. The White House originally required petitions to gather 5,000 signatures within 30 days, after which time policy officials in the administration would review the petition and issue an official response. Within two weeks of its launch, the threshold was raised to 25,000 signatures. Further changes in 2013 raised the threshold to 100,000 signatures.\n\nOther groups are attempting to establish electronic petitioning as a way to streamline and make existing citizens' initiative processes more accessible.\n\nAs is the case with public perceptions of slacktivism, Internet petitions are both a popular resort of web-based activism and a target of criticism from those who feel that such petitions are often disregarded by their targets because of the anonymity of petition signers; Snopes.com, for example, sides against the usage of Internet petitions as a method of activism. On the other hand, the creators of petition hosts, such as Randy Paynter of Care2 and thePetitionSite.com, have defended web-based petitions as being more feasible, credible and effective than e-mail petitions, claiming they are not fairly judged as a method of activism by their critics. Since then, Snopes.com has removed the text about the inefficacy of Internet petitions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2050460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050460", "title": "Pancha pathi", "text": "Pancha pathi\n\nPancha pathi (Tamil: பஞ்ச பதி, \"the five abodes of God\") are the five important pilgrim centers of Ayyavazhi. These are also considered as the primary Pathis and as worship centers of Ayyavazhi with primary status. The first pathi is Swamithope pathi itself and is the headquarters of Ayyavazhi. The other Pathis are Muttappathi, Thamaraikulam Pathi, Ambalappathi and Pooppathi. \n\nAll the five of the Panchappathis are located within a Fifteen-kilometer circle of Kanyakumari, the land end of the Indian Sub-continent.\n\nSwamithoppe is the religious headquarters of Ayyavazhi. This was considered also as primary among the Panchappathi. This was the place where The Great Tavam of Ayya took place. The land's holiness is described in Akilattirattu Ammanai that \"Parthiban\", the legendary Arjuna made penance to get \"Pasupathasthiram\" from Lord Siva. This was also the birthplace of Veda Vyasa who wrote the Mahabharata. This was the place where the demons were burned up by Vaikundar as per Akilam. Moreover, the act of seizing the powers of witchcraft, magic etc. were conducted here. \n\nAyya also unified into him the Seven virgins at this place. Vaikundar is also said to have performed several miracles at Swamithoppe. Because of all these reasons this center is considered more sacred than all other pathi and also seen with high religious importance. \n\nThis is one of the most important religious centers in Tamil Nadu and attracts a huge crowd from across the country. The London Missionary Society Reports of the 19th century speaks in abundance about this Pathi and the huge attraction of crowd even from those days.\n\nMuttappathi was the place where the second phase Thuvayal Thavasu was conducted by the followers of Ayya Vaikundar after completing the Thuvayal Thavasu for six-months in Vahaippathi as per his instructions. The seven hundred families lived as a group, constructing huts at the sea-shore; so, there prevailed group economy. The neighbours heard about this pure Vegetarian life, which is unusual particularly among the so-called lower castes. A lot of people came to witness the life of devotees. The coconut grove where Thuvayal Thavasu was conducted belonged to a pious Brahmin. Hearing about Thuvayal Thavasu, he came to that place and witnessed it. He became so attached to these principles of Ayya Vaikundar that he gave away that land to the people Ayya Vaikundar. \n\nThe present Muttappathi was established there and was under the direct control of the Payyan dynasty. Later, due to some litigations, the land was auctioned by the government. Those who got the land in the auction conducted the daily Panividai. Now, their descendants conduct the panividai and administer the Pathi which is managed by a Trust. \n\nAlso this centre earns another religious importance. Ayya Vaikundar went into the sea just before his arrest and also after the completion of his Tavam to meet his Father Vishnu for the First Muttappathi Vinchai from near this spot. So this centre is directly associated by the incarnational activities of Vaikundar. Ayyavazhi people have a believe that, it is sanctifying to take a holy dip in the sea at Muttappathi. \n\nEvery year, on the last Friday of the Tamil Month Panguni, people march from Swamithoppe in large numbers to Muttappathi. This festival is called Panguni Theertham. The elder most or others from Payyan dynasty of Swamithoppe conduct the Panividai and also the Annadharmam on that day at Muttappathi.\n\nTamaraikulampathi is the birthplace of Hari Gopalan Citar, one of the disciples of Ayya Vaikundar. He was also called the \"Sahadevan\". Akilattirattu Ammanai, the holy book of Ayyavazhi is told as a prophecy to Hari Gopalan Citar by God. So, he became well known of all the disciples of Ayya Vaikundar. People of this village once invited Ayya Vaikundar to their village. Ayya Vaikundar went there and he was given warm welcome and a treat. Ayya Vaikundar stayed there for a day and returned to Swamithoppe. \n\nDuring the early years, Ayya Vaikundar was taken to this village in a vahana by people once in a year. The auspicious day was the last Sunday of the Tamil month Panguni. In those days, people celebrated this occasion as a festival. This practice has been discontinued for the past fifty years. Daily Panividai is being conducted here. Now, there are Vahanas made of wood for the festivals.\n\nThamaraikulam Pathi is situated in the South Thamaraikulam, one kilometer south of Swamithoppe. One can reach this place from Nagercoil or Kanyakumari by Town bus. It is fourteen kilometers away from Nagercoil.\n\nAyya Vaikundar after the Tavam, went to a place called Pallam near Manakkudy and stayed there for two years. This place is called as Ambalappathi. Ayya Vaikundar was a Shiva-sorub (taking the form of Siva) at this place. Here, an \"ambalam\" was constructed with Ninety-six beams meeting at a wooden pot mounted at center and Ayya Vaikundar preached from that Ambalam. Here, as a Shiva-sorubi, Ayya assumed the powers of Parvathi and Bhagavathi. \n\nAs Muruga, he assumed the powers of Valli and Dheivanai. As Brahma, he also assumed the powers of \"Madaikattal\". It was from this place that the devotees took Ayya on horseback to such villages as Kadambankulam and Pambankulam. Ayya established Nizhal Thangals in these villages. Later, at the end of the second year, Ayya Vaikundar returned to Swamithoppe. \n\nLater, on this very spot the owners of the land constructed a Pathi and conducted daily Panividai. Now, this Pathi is managed by the descendants of the people who constructed the Pathi. Every year Car festivals are conducted in this Pathi. There are many Vahanas to carry Ayya Vaikundar around the Pathi. This Pathi is located ten Kilometers south of Nagercoil. There is a direct bus service from Nagercoil to this Pathi. \n\nSince Ayya Vaikundar all the different divine powers into himself and revealed his supremacy at this spot, this is the most important Pilgrim centers of Ayyavazhi people, next to Swamithoppe. This Pathi is also called \"Pallathu pathi\" and \"Mulakunda pathi\".\n\nAyya Vaikundar spend his last six years of the incarnational period at Swamithoppe. He lived as a normal human person. He maintained fields and groves. He also maintained cattle. Bhoomadevi (the goddess of Earth) as Poomadanthai was living at a place near Eathamozhi. Some devotees wanted to unite this divine couple. But there was stiff opposition from the relatives of the girl. Poomadanthai was chanting the praise of Ayya Vaikundar and proved that she was extraordinary.\n\nLater, the relatives called Ayya Vaikundar to their village and give the girl's hand in a marriage to Vaikundar. Poomadanthai was happily united with Ayya Vaikundar. This Poomadanthai was one among the Seven deities unified into Vaikundar and the only deity unified not at Ambalappathi. Ayya Vaikundar took rest there in a grove full of beautiful laurel trees. Akilam says that, the buds of this trees were like pearls and the place was very cool.\n\nLater, the devotees established a Pathi at this place as per the instructions of Vaikundar found in Akilam and it is called as Poopathi. Festivals are conducted every year and this Pathi is owned by the village and maintained by the village committee. Poopathi is located about ten kilometers south of Nagercoil and Eathamozhi.\n\n\n"}
