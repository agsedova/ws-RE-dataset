It was in Kirkcaldy that \"Wispy\", as Wallace was nicknamed, developed his reputation as a top-class goal poacher, his skills being rewarded with a first Scottish League cap.\n\nWallace's form attracted attention from larger clubs, Heart of Midlothian eventually spending £15,000 to take him to Edinburgh in April 1961. The increased pressure for success at Tynecastle initially curtailed his scoring exploits, for he was expected to replace no less a figure than Alex Young, the \"Golden Vision\", whom Hearts had sold to Everton a couple of months earlier. By season 1962–63, however, Wallace was fully settled into the tactics of manager Tommy Walker, and he would become Hearts' top scorer for the next four seasons through to 1965–66. In doing so, he helped Hearts win the 1962–63 Scottish League Cup and come within a goal of winning the 1964–65 Scottish League, while gaining full international recognition for Scotland.\n\nIn 1966, however, his form plummeted and his goal scoring ceased, and, amid rumours that he had been \"tapped\" up by another club, his departure from Tynecastle was widely anticipated. The surprise was that his destination wasn't boyhood favourites Rangers but their nemesis Celtic, for whom Jock Stein paid £30,000 to secure his services.\n\nWithin 6 months he was to attain Scottish footballing immortality, as one of the \"Lisbon Lions\", the famous Celtic team who won the European Cup in 1967. He also won the league championship in each season he was at the Glasgow club, the Scottish Cup in 1967, 1969 and 1971 and the League Cup in 1968 and 1969 during an era widely considered the greatest in the club's history. In total, he scored 135 goals in 234 games. He was part of the 2–1 defeat to Feyenoord in the 1970 European Cup final.\n\nAfter five fruitful years with Celtic, Wallace and team-mate John Hughes were sold to Crystal Palace in October 1971 for a combined fee of £30,000. Neither enjoyed great success in Croydon and Wallace was back in Scotland with Dumbarton less than a year later. As his career wound down, he moved to Australia in March 1975 to play for APIA, where he won 2 league titles before returning to Scotland in March 1977, first to Partick Thistle for a week, before becoming player-coach at Ross County for the rest of the 1976–77 season.\n\nIn total, Wallace was capped seven times for Scotland and four times for the Scottish League XI. He was part of the Scotland team that defeated England at Wembley in 1967.\n\nRetiring as a player in June 1977, he joined the coaching staff at Dundee. When this role ended he returned to APIA as a coach, eventually settling in Sydney and starting his own sports shop.\n\nIn 2008, Tommy Burns, a former Celtic player and manager, died; Wallace helped organise a tribute match played on 31 May 2009 at Celtic Park, attended by over 35,000 people. The Celtic squad of the time defeated the 'Tommy Burns Select' team 11–4. In July of the same year, Wallace arranged a friendly match in Australia (where he had lived for the past 30 years) between Celtic and the local professional club Brisbane Roar; Celtic won 3–0.\n\n\n"}

Successive boundary changes removed certain ex-mining communities to the new Barnsley East constituency in 1983: this and the addition of the more Conservative-inclined ward of Wakefield South in 1997 slightly reduced Labour's dominance, but Hemsworth remained a safe seat in the 2017 election.

Consequently, Sveinbjörn gained a far higher level of musical education than other musicians in Iceland at that time.\nAs the musical opportunities were limited in Iceland at the end of the 19th century, Sveinbjörn moved to Edinburgh. His composition pieces were mostly melody songs or poetical chamber music in the spirit of Mendelssohn. Sveinbjörn also composed a considerable number of folk songs.\nIn 1922, the Icelandic parliament, Althing, decided to grant him a pension, which allowed him to return to Iceland.

{"id": "1821178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821178", "title": "Coast Air", "text": "Coast Air\n\nCoast Air AS was a regional airline based at Haugesund Airport, Karmøy in Norway. It was Norway's fourth largest airline and operated domestic services within Norway, in addition to international services. Routes were concentrated along the West Coast, as well as some public service obligation contracts in Southern Norway. The company had a fleet of de Havilland Canada Twin Otter aircraft, later replaced with Jetstream 31s and ATR 42s.\n\nThe company was founded on the remains of Coast Aero Center, which operated from 1975 to 1988. Coast Air started flying de Havilland Canada Twin Otter aircraft from Haugesund to Oslo Airport, Fornebu and Bergen Airport, Flesland. In 1990, service from Fagernes Airport, Leirin was also introduced, a route that lasted until 1997. Following the deregulation of aviation in Norway in 1994, Coast Air started several regional routes, replacing its fleet with Jetstream 31 aircraft. From 2000, Coast Air also served Florø Airport on public service obligation with the Ministry of Transport, using ATR 42 aircraft. In 2003, it lost the Florø contract, but regained the Fagernes route. From 1999, Coast Air started competing direct with the larger airlines on main routes, and introduced new regional and international services. From then on, the company continuously lost money. From 2004, it wet-leased aircraft to Vildanden, but the contract was canceled the following year. Following attempts to start new international route, Coast Air filed for bankruptcy in 2008.\n\nCoast Aero Center started operations in 1975 from Haugesund Airport. The company was a local mechanical and small-plane operator until 1984, when it started to apply for concessions to perform regional airline services in Norway. The company was owned and run by Asbjørn Utne.\nFollowing the 1984 decision by Scandinavian Airlines System to discontinue their route from Haugesund to Aberdeen in the United Kingdom, Coast Aero Center applied for the concession. They would use a 15-seat Embraer Bandeirante that would be bought used for NOK 7.5 million. Coast Aero Center started their service on 20 August 1986, but it turned out to be unprofitable, and was terminated in April 1987.\n\nIn October 1984, Coast Aero Center, along with Norving and Fonnafly, applied for concession for the routes from Stord Airport, Sørstokken to Oslo, Bergen and Stavanger. Coast Air was successful at receiving the concession, and service started on 12 August 1986 with a ten-seater Beechcraft Super King 200. In August, the company also received concession to fly from Stord via Skien Airport, Geiteryggen to Oslo. By March 1987, traffic had increased so much that the company instead put a larger, 20-seater Twin Otter aircraft into service. Additional concessions to fly to Haugesund were also granted the same year, as were direct services to Oslo, making the stops in Skien unnecessary.\n\nIn 1985, the company joined the joint venture Commuter Service, along with the other regional airlines Mørefly, based in Ålesund, Trønderfly, based in Trondheim, and Norsk Flytjeneste, based in Sandefjord. The goal was to coordinate the services, and grow through newer, smaller routes. On 20 June 1986, Coast Aero Center was awarded the concession for flying from Stavanger to Geilo Airport, Dagali until 1991. The airline put into service a Beechcraft Super King 200. The ridership from Geilo turned out to be too low, and both Coast Aero Center and Norving terminated their routes. In 1986, the revenue was NOK 14 million and the company had 24 employees. That year, they chose to connect to the PNR/Smart booking system. In 1988, the company also bid for operating parts of the Norwegian Air Ambulance.\n\nThe company was thrown into financial distress on 7 February 1988, when Den norske Creditbank (DnC) announced that they would not issue more credit. At the time the company had nine daily routes and 35 employees. All services were immediately suspended. It had a debt of NOK 23 million, of which DnC demanded NOK 13 million paid by 10 February; the bank later gave the company three weeks to find the capital. On 17 February, a proposal for refinancing was made, where the hangars were sold to the local municipalities, who would also make a guarantee for NOK 2 million. DnC would delete part of the debt, and additional capital would be granted from Kosmos-owned Norsk Air. This was not sufficient, and on 29 April Coast Aero Center filed for bankruptcy. Asbjørn Utne had to file for personal bankruptcy.\n\nFollowing the bankruptcy, the estate was purchased by Coast Air. In 1989, the new company received a one-year concession to operate from Haugesund to Bergen and Stavanger, and from Geilo to Oslo and Stavanger. The company used de Havilland Canada Twin Otter aircraft. The following year, Coast Air also received the concession for operating the subsidized routes to the newly opened Fagernes Airport, Leirin. Six companies bid for the route, but only Coast Air and Widerøe were deemed qualified; Coast Air could operate for NOK 2 million annually less than Widerøe, and therefore received the concession. Operation started on 3 September 1990, with the concession valid until 24 October 1993. In 1991, Coast Air flew 5,000 passengers to and from Fagernes Airport. With a NOK 6.8 million subsidy, it was the most expensive subsidized route per passenger in the country. This was largely due to a 20% cabin load. In August 1991, Coast Air received concession until 1993 for the route Haugesund–Bergen, but the Haugesund–Stavanger route was canceled. In March 1992, Coast Air was denied a concession to operate from Stord to Stavanger; instead, the concession was granted to Air Stord. Coast Air started flying from Skien Airport in 1993, with a route to Bergen.\n\nOn 1 April 1994, the Norwegian airline market was deregulated. Airlines no longer needed to apply for concession from the government, but could fly any route they wanted to. For the first time, several airlines could establish themselves on the same route. The exception was the state-subsidized regional routes, that would become subject to public service obligations (PSO) from 1 April 1997. Following the deregulation, Coast Air introduced a route from Bergen to Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik with a Jetstream 31. From 1995, the airline was forced to pay much higher fees to the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration, following the decision that all commercial plans, also those under , should pay flight fees. In October, Coast Air was close to buying Air Stord, but the company was instead sold to Aker. In 1995, two new Jetstream 31 aircraft were delivered, and the Twin Otter aircraft were transferred to the new route between Stord and Stavanger. A third Jetstream was delivered the following year, and the Twin Otter was taken out of service.\n\nThe state-subsidized regional airline contracts were made subject to PSO in 1996. In a trial tender for the Fagernes route. Five domestic airlines bid, and Teddy Air won. Their bid was NOK 23.7 million, 15% lower than the former subsidy for Coast Air. In the main tender, the Ministry of Transport and Communications issued seven packages, of which Coast Air chose to bid for two—to the airports in Namdal and Helgeland, and to Andøya Airport, Andenes. All seven packages were won by the incumbent operator Widerøe. The new tenders took effect on 1 April 1997, and lasted three years.\nCoast Air's first PSO contract was awarded in September 1999, on the route from Florø Airport to Oslo and Bergen. This required that the company put into service two 46-seat ATR 42–300 aircraft. It also caused a problem for Widerøe, who had their technical base for Western Norway at Florø. The company received NOK 51 million annually, from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2003; this resulted in there no longer being in intermediate stops from Florø to Bergen and Oslo. Color Air flew four or five daily trips to both Bergen and Oslo. The bid was about NOK 100 million lower than from Widerøe. Saga Petroleum, who used Florø Airport as a helicopter base to fly their workers to offshore oil platforms, was critical to the use of the ATR 42 aircraft; while they were suitable for Florø, that has a runway, the planes would not be able to land at other airports in Sogn og Fjordane. In cases of bad weather, the oil company would now have to bus their passengers from Bergen and Ålesund, instead of much closer airports, such as Førde Airport, Bringeland. In February 2000, Coast Air was hit by a strike regarding which of the pilots were to be recertified to fly the larger ATR 42 aircraft. The pilots insisted that seniority be used for selection, while management wanted to be able to choose themselves. Management also wanted to secure that all personnel that were recertified signed a three-year working contract with the company. Not until mid-March was the strike settled, after a compromise had been reached.\nIn January 2000, Braathens decided that it would terminate its service from Oslo to Røros Airport, as well as reducing the number of flights between Haugesund and Bergen. Coast Air therefore announced it would increase the number of departures between Haugesund and Bergen, and at the same time was willing to fly to Røros if a state subsidy was granted. The contract to Røros was however won by Danish Air Transport (DAT), who bid NOK 500,000 per month, NOK 64,000 less than Coast Air.\n\nThe demand for air travel dropped in 2001, and only 85,000 passengers flew with Coast Air to Florø, instead of the estimated 100,000, making the entire operation a loss for the company. Despite this, Coast Air leased a third ATR 42 aircraft in February 2002. But cancellations continued to rise, and in November the company's subsidies from the ministry were reduced due to lack of performance. In December 2001, Guard Air was forced to terminate all operations, and a new PSO tender was made for the services to Fagernes. Along with Arctic Air, Widerøe and DAT, Coast Air made a bid. The contract was won by Arctic Air. With the next round of PSO contracts, valid from 1 April 2003 through 31 March 2006, Coast Air lost the Florø contract to DAT, but succeeded at winning the contract for Fagernes for NOK 10 million per year.\n\nFollowing the 2005 announcement of the PSO contracts from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2009, Coast Air was awarded three contracts. In addition to retaining the Fagernes route, it also received the concession for the Røros and Andenes routes. The three routes gave NOK 35 million in annual subsidies. Røros and Andenes would be served by ATR 42-aircraft, while Jetstreams would be used to Fagernes. From 30 January 2007, the company also started flying from Røros to Trondheim twice a week. From 1 April 2007, Coast Air canceled their flights to Andenes. Since the operations were separated from the rest of the network, it was not possible to fly profitably. Widerøe subsequently took over the route. During July 2007, Coast Air introduced the smaller Jetstream aircraft on the routes to Røros.\n\nFollowing the loss of the Fagernes route, Coast Air relocated its services to the Bergen–Skien and the Haugesund–Aberdeen route in 1997. After Air Stord filed for bankruptcy in February 1999, Coast Air and Teddy Air both started flights from the airport to Oslo. Coast Air also expanded Kristiansand as a hub, with additional routes to Stavanger, Haugesund and Gothenburg in Sweden. In January 2000, the company announced that it was not making any money on the Kristiansand routes, and immediately terminated all four services. Coast air carried 50,000 passengers in 1999.\n\nAfter having made small profits ten years in a row until 1998, Coast Air had a loss of NOK 18.6 million and a revenue of NOK 40.5 million in 1999. To increase liquidity, the company sold two of its four Jetstream 31 aircraft. The establishment in the PSO market was expensive for Coast Air, and the airline lost NOK 9.7 million in 2000. To counteract, the company's owners chose to perform a private placement of NOK 7.5 million. By April 2001, the liquidity problems in Coast Air were so severe that the employees threatened to file for bankruptcy. Coast Air chose to terminate the Haugesund–Aberdeen route, and replace it with a service between Bergen and Aberdeen. With the Scandinavian Airlines System take-over of Braathens in May, Coast Air became the largest airline in the country not owned by the SAS Group. In 2003, the company chose to reintroduce the route between Stavanger and Geilo. Following Ryanair's establishment of a route from Haugesunnd to London-Stansted in 2003, Coast Air won the contract for ground services in competition with SAS Ground Services.\nWith the freeing up of aircraft after the 2003 PSO contract losses, Coast Air introduced and additional daily flight to Aberdeen. However, this was countered by Widerøe, who also started flying the route with Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 aircraft. Coast Air also introduced three daily flights from Stord to Oslo. On 5 May, the company started flights between Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget and Trondheim Airport, Værnes, after having received a NOK 150,000 subsidy from the Municipality of Kristiansund for marketing the route. The competition to Aberdeen proved to be too fierce, and Coast Air terminated operations in December. In September, the company ended in court with the labor union, regarding whether the company had promised them a fifth week of holiday in earlier negotiations; the company lost the court case.\n\nOn 2 June 2003, Coast Air started its first head-on competition with Scandinavian Airlines. Using the ATR planes, Coast Air started with two daily round services between Haugesund and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. By September, Coast Air increased to three daily round trips, and reduced prices to NOK 500. From 9 October, Scandinavian Airlines reduced their prices by 22% on the route. On 16 February, Coast Air also started competing with Braathens and Widerøe on the route between Stavanger and Bergen, marketing it as a low-fare service and ticket prices as low as NOK 199. The Haugesund–Oslo route cost Coast Air NOK 11 million in 2003. In March 2004, Coast Air was forced to close the Stord to Oslo route, after several reductions in frequency during the past year. To create more inertia on the Bergen–Stavanger route, Coast Air also started a cooperation with DAT, where the latter flew an extra daily round trip. Following the losses of the Haugesund–Oslo and Bergen–Stavanger routes, they were terminated in May 2004. In December, the Norwegian Competition Authority started investigating Scandinavian Airlines for illegal price dumping on the Oslo–Haugesund route. The authority suspected that SAS had illegally cross-subsidized the route to fend off the competition, and announced the company would be fined NOK 20 million. The case ended in Oslo District Court, where Scandinavian Airlines was found not guilty. Though initially appealed by the authority, the matter was settled out-of-court in December 2007, in which the airline agreed that they had broken the law, but that since it happened just after the act came into power, they would not have to pay the fine.\n\nOn 23 November 2004, eighteen local investors founded the airline Vildanden to start scheduled flights from Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. For a long period, there had been a public debate about closing the airport. It was decided to operate the company as a virtual airline, and wet lease operations from other companies. In October 2004, a contract was signed with Coast Air, who would operate a Jetstream 31 aircraft between Skien and Bergen. Coast Air also bought 20% of Vildanden. Skien Airport had then been closed since 2002, following the increased domestic and international traffic from near-by Sandefjord Airport, Torp.\n\nInitial service would have 16 weekly departures to Bergen Airport, Flesland. The main targeted market segment was the offshore petroleum industry, and the departure times were designed to meet helicopter routes to offshore installations. The company estimated that one quarter of travelers would be people commuting to the North Sea. Norsk Hydro, who have a lot of employees in the Grenland area, stated that they could not start using Vildanden because they had an agreement to use SAS Braathens' services from Sandefjord. The first scheduled service flew on 24 January 2005, carrying eight passenger.\n\nOn 19 April, a new Jetstream 32 aircraft was taken into service. This allowed capacity to increase from 12 to 19 passengers, and at the same time travel time was reduced from 47 to 39 minutes. By September, the most popular departures were being fully booked, and Vildanden asked Coast Air for a larger aircraft, with about 30 seats. In addition to allowing more passengers, larger planes would give higher comfort, and allow a more flexible ticket pricing scheme. An agreement with Danish Air Transport (DAT) to operate an ATR 42, with a capacity of 48 seats, was signed by Vildanden in mid October.\nTo be able to breach the agreement with Coast Air—who still had a wet leasing contract, but were not able to put into operation a larger aircraft—the company Skien Lufttransport AS was created, and it purchased all the revenue and passenger rights from Vildanden. At the same time, it became the legal counterpart for DAT. The new aircraft was put into service on 31 October, branded with the Vildanden logo. Coast Air chose to continue operating the route between Bergen and Skien in their own name, and used the same aircraft and slot times. At Skien Airport, the Vildanden passengers were given the choice between Coast Air and Vildanden, and all nineteen chose Vildanden. On the return flight, three passengers chose each airline. Both aircraft flew to Skien, but due to heavy rain, only the aircraft from DAT was able to land. The passengers who had taken the Coast Air aircraft were instead forced to land at Sandefjord Airport.\n\nThe following day, Coast Air terminated their flights, but stated that they still had an agreement with Vildanden. Skien Lufttransport on their hand stated that Vildanden was now a sleeping company, and that contract therefore was terminated. Both companies considered the incident a legal matter. In December, the two companies settled out of court.\n\nUntil 2004, Coast Air was owned by the holding company Kystfly AS (Norwegian for \"Coast Air\"), which was again owned by four people: Trygve Seglem through TS Invest, Harry Aase through Aase Invest, Asbjørn Utne and the Hystad family through Karmsund Maritime Invest. From 2001 to 2003, NOK 35 million were given in private placements to the company, but in February 2004, the Hystad family chose to withdraw from the corporation. At the time the company had 78 employees. By April the company was on the verge of bankruptcy, but private placements by Seglem and Aase meant the company could continue operating. However, the entire ATR 42-fleet would be sold, and Coast Air was to change focus to the wetleasing market with the Jetstream 31 aircraft.\nIn August 2004, Seglem bought the entire company from the partners. After the reorganization, the company made a small profit in the last quarter of 2004. However, for the whole 2004, the company lost NOK 17.6 million. In September, Coast Air started flying the Stord–Oslo route again, using the ATR planes, following the termination by Golden Air. On 19 November, Coast Air also started a route between Stord, Haugesund and Sandefjord once per week. In 2005, the company also introduced a flight between Haugesund and Molde Airport, Årø. In February 2006, the company started flying twice a day from Sandefjord to Stockholm using the Jetstream aircraft. With increased traffic and the new PSO contracts, Coast Air received a third ATR 42 aircraft in April. Restructurization led to Coast Air dropping ground services, and from 1 May 2007, SAS Ground Services handled Coast Air's planes at Haugesund. The company also introduced in-flight breakfast on all ATR 42-flights. In addition, it started with two daily round trips from Haugesund to Copenhagen Airport in Denmark. The airline also introduced a business lounge for passengers traveling in Super Economy class. In November, another route was opened with two weekly round services from Stord to Gdańsk in Poland.\n\nOn 23 January 2008, the board of Coast Air filed for bankruptcy. High costs made the owner Seglem lose faith in future profits. The company had lost more than NOK 100 million since 2001. It was Norway's fourth largest airline at the time. The company lost NOK 30 million in 2007, and Seglem was stated that he was tired of covering the losses of the company. He also felt that the agreement the company had with the pilots gave less working hours compared to the competitors Norwegian Air Shuttle and Danish Air Transport, and the lack of understanding from the pilots made him give up. Half the 95 employees in the company were pilots. All the aircraft were owned by the mother company Kystfly, and there were no values in the estate. DAT offered to purchase the three ATR 42 aircraft, and hire part of the crew who lost their jobs as a consequence of the bankruptcy.\n\nWiderøe announced that it would take up the routes from Haugesund to Copenhagen. After an extraordinary PSO tender, Widerøe was awarded the flights to Røros, while Air Norway was awarded the flights to Fagernes. With the fall of Coast Air, Stord Airport was without any scheduled routes and income, and lost NOK 350,000 per month until a new service was in place. The routes to Stord were taken over by Sun Air of Scandinavia, who operate Dornier 328 aircraft on franchise from British Airways.\n\nAs of January 2008, Coast Air operated to the following destinations\n\n"}

The band consisted of Bob Nanna on guitar and vocals, Todd Bell on bass and vocals, Mark Dawursk on guitar and vocals and Damon Atkinson on drums. Hey Mercedes proved a more melodic antidote to the previous band.\n\nHey Mercedes had their first practice session in April 2000. Their first release was a self-titled EP on Polyvinyl Records in September 2000. Soon after its release, they signed to Vagrant Records and started touring for support of their upcoming Vagrant full length. In 2001 alone, they performed 114 shows. In October 2001, the band released \"Everynight Fire Works\". In November and December, the group went on tour with Saves the Day and Thursday.\n\nAfter writing the majority of the band's EP and first full length at the end of 2001, Dawursk left the band and was replaced with Mike Shumaker. In February and March 2003, the group went on tour with Armor for Sleep. The band released \"Loses Control\" in October 2003. In February 2004, the group supported Wheat on their US tour. In March, the group supported The Early November on their headlining US tour. Following this, the group supported Saves the Day until mid-April.\n\nWith 2 full lengths, 3 EPs and 358 shows under their belt, Hey Mercedes called it quits. Their final show (#359) was at the Metro in Chicago on April 23 of 2005.\n\nIn a 2007 e-mail campaign, Threadless Tees reported that Hey Mercedes would play at the Metro, to celebrate the grand opening of the company's Chicago store They group performed two shows in September. The band remains inactive, but plays occasional shows.\n\nIn early 2009 lead singer Nanna confirmed via Twitter that a new band with drummer Atkinson is in the works. The band will be somewhat the same style as Hey Mercedes.\n\nIn 2016, it was announced that the band would perform at the Wrecking Ball festival in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1821191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821191", "title": "The Final Countdown (album)", "text": "The Final Countdown (album)\n\nThe Final Countdown is the third studio album by the Swedish rock band Europe. Released on 26 May 1986 through Epic Records, the album was a huge commercial success selling over 15 million copies worldwide, peaking at number 8 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 chart and reaching high positions in charts worldwide. It was recorded at Powerplay Studios in Zürich, Soundtrade Studios in Stockholm, Mastersound Studios in Atlanta and Fantasy Studios in Berkeley. \"The Final Countdown\" is the first album to feature keyboardist Mic Michaeli and drummer Ian Haugland and the last to feature guitarist John Norum until 2004's \"Start from the Dark\".\n\nFive singles were released from the album: \"The Final Countdown\", \"Love Chaser\", \"Rock the Night\", \"Carrie\", and \"Cherokee.\" The first single was responsible for launching Europe into mainstream popularity.\n\n\"Rock the Night\" and \"Ninja\" were the first songs written for the album, and were premiered on the band's \"Wings of Tomorrow\" tour in 1984. \"Rock the Night\" was released as a single in Sweden in 1985, peaking at number 4 on the chart, and was also featured on the soundtrack EP for the Swedish film \"On the Loose\" the same year, together with the songs \"On the Loose\" and \"Broken Dreams.\" \"Rock the Night\" and \"On the Loose\" would be re-recorded for inclusion on \"The Final Countdown\" along with \"Ninja\", all with slightly different lyrics.\n\nDue to the national success of \"On the Loose\" and \"Rock the Night\", Europe went on a new tour around Sweden in 1985, with new songs \"Danger on the Track\", \"Love Chaser\" and the power ballad \"Carrie\" included in the setlist and ready to be recorded for the album. \"Carrie\" was co-written by Tempest and keyboardist Mic Michaeli during a jam session. The early version of the song consisted of only keyboards and vocals, and was performed that way on the 1985 tour, but the album version would feature the whole band.\n\nThe song \"The Final Countdown\" was based on an old keyboard riff that Tempest had composed as early as 1981–82, on a Korg Polysix keyboard he had borrowed from Michaeli. In 1985 bassist John Levén suggested that Tempest should write a song based on that riff. The lyrics were inspired by David Bowie's song \"Space Oddity\". The sound of the keyboard riff used in the recording was achieved by using a Yamaha TX-816 rack unit and a Roland JX-8P synthesizer. \"I made a brassy sound from the JX-8P and used a factory sound from the Yamaha, and just layered them together\", Michaeli said.\n\n\"Cherokee\" was the last song written for the album, being written only a week before the band went to Switzerland to start recording the album. Tempest said he had been inspired by the history of the Native Americans to write the song.\n\nThe recording of the album began in September 1985 at the Powerplay Studios in Zürich, Switzerland. At the suggestion of their record company, Epic Records, the band decided to work with the American producer Kevin Elson, who had worked with bands like Journey and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Originally the band had approached Scorpions producer Dieter Dierks and Bon Jovi producer Bruce Fairbairn to produce the album, but in the end they decided to go with Elson. Elson would also produce the band's sixth studio album, \"Start from the Dark\" in 2004.\n\nDuring the recording sessions, vocalist Joey Tempest came down with a bad allergic reaction to bread products, which delayed the recording for a while, and forced Joey to make changes to his diet, so he could complete his work on the album. The vocals for the title track were recorded at the Soundtrade Studios, Stockholm, Sweden, while the rest of the vocals were recorded at the Mastersound Studios, Atlanta and Fantasy Studios, Berkeley, California.\n\nThe album was mixed in March 1986 at Fantasy Studios. Guitarist John Norum was not pleased with the result, claiming that the keyboards had \"buried\" the rhythm guitars in the final mix.\n\"The Final Countdown\" was the band's breakout album and granted Europe international recognition. Upon its release in May 1986, it sold very well in most European countries and peaked at No. 8 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 album chart. By 1994, it achieved triple Platinum status in the United States and received sales awards all over Europe.\n\nWhen it was time to choose the first single from the album, Tempest suggested \"The Final Countdown\". Originally the band had never planned to release the song as a single, and some members wanted \"Rock the Night\" to be the first single. \"The Final Countdown\" was written to be an opening song for concerts, and they never thought it would be a hit. But when their record company Epic Records suggested that it should be the first single, the band decided to release it. It became a worldwide success, peaking at number 1 in 25 countries, including the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, and Italy. In the US, it peaked at number 8 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 18 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The song has been a regular in Europe concerts ever since its live debut on the premiere of the band's Final Countdown Tour on 29 April 1986 in Gävle, Sweden and arguably became the band's most recognizable and popular song. One of the most memorable performances of the song took place in Stockholm, Sweden on 31 December 1999, as part of the Millennium celebrations.\n\n\"Love Chaser\" was released as a single in Japan only, and was on the soundtrack for the movie \"Pride One\". \"Rock the Night\" was released as the worldwide follow-up single to \"The Final Countdown.\" It became a Top 10 hit in Germany, Holland, France, Ireland, Italy and Switzerland, and peaked at number 30 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and number 12 on the UK Singles Chart. The next single, \"Carrie\", peaked at number 3 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, their highest single on the chart to date. \"Cherokee\" was released as the last single from the album, peaking at number 72 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nAll the singles \"The Final Countdown\" became hits and their accompanying music videos received heavy airplay on music television. Eight of the ten tracks on the album were featured in the 2007 comedy film \"Hot Rod\".\n\n\"The Final Countdown\" received mixed reviews upon its release. \"Rolling Stone\" \"Magazine\" writer J. D. Considine wrote that \"the words to 'The Final Countdown' make almost no sense whatsoever on paper, but there's genuine drama to the way Tempest's keening vocals surge through the mock-orchestral morass of synths and guitar. Maybe it's trite, maybe it's derivative, but it's also undeniably effective. From the stirring stadium schlock of 'Rock the Night' to the self-indulgent melodrama of 'Love Chaser', the best moments here are insidiously catchy, leaving you humming along against your better judgment\". Howard Johnson of \"Kerrang!\" was not excited by the album and considered Europe \"just bland and boring\" and \"boasting the most nauseating keyboard sound on a title track of all time\".\n\nThe contemporary review by Doug Stone of AllMusic was more positive. He finds the title track \"bombastically brilliant glorious garbage ... that could only spew from the vacuous '80s\", but writes that the rest of the songs combines \"heated drive and hot delivery to meld \"The Final Countdown\" into a unique portrait of propulsive prog and a worthy addition to any hard rock collection.\" Canadian Journalist Martin Popoff remarks how the album \"sounds very nice, rhythmic, even modern beyond its years, but it's also gutless and shamefully commercial\". PopMatters' Ben Varkentine, on the contrary, reviewed badly the album criticizing the production and the composition of \"rock songs with half-assed keyboard lines smeared on them\", which \"aimed at being anthems but succeeded only in being derivative not only of other bands but of themselves.\"\n\nThe first leg of the Swedish tour started in Gävle on 29 April 1986. The album had not been released yet because the cover art was not complete, but Europe was forced to start the scheduled tour. The album was eventually released on 26 May, the same day that the band played the last concert on the leg, at Solnahallen in Solna. The band did two concerts at Solnahallen, on 25 and 26 May. These concerts were filmed for a TV broadcast, which would later be released on VHS and DVD, entitled \"The Final Countdown Tour 1986\". A \"\" of the DVD was released in 2006. The promotional music video for \"The Final Countdown\" was shot partly during the soundchecks for those concerts and partly during the actual concerts.\n\nEurope went on a Japanese tour in September 1986, playing four concerts in Tokyo and one concert each in Nagoya and Osaka. During that tour, guitarist and band co-founder John Norum told the other band members that he wanted to leave the band, due to musical differences and other disagreements with the band's manager, Thomas Erdtman. Norum agreed to stay in the band for the second leg of the Swedish tour, which started in Örebro on 26 September 1986, as well as a promotion tour around Europe including TV appearances and interviews. He made his last appearance with the band for a Sky Channel broadcast at the club Escape in Amsterdam, Netherlands on 31 October 1986.\n\nNorum was then replaced by Kee Marcello, who had just left another Swedish rock band, Easy Action. At first Marcello had been hesitant to join Europe, because he had put a lot of work into Easy Action's upcoming album \"That Makes One\". After some consideration he changed his mind and decided to join the band. He appeared in the music videos for \"Rock the Night\", \"Cherokee\" and \"Carrie,\" before making his first TV appearance with the band at Peters Popshow in Dortmund, West Germany on 12 December 1986.\n\nThe European leg of the tour started in Bergen, Norway on 24 January 1987 and ended in Genoa, Italy on 3 March 1987. A concert done at Hammersmith Odeon, London on 23 February, was filmed and released on video, entitled \"The Final Countdown World Tour\".\n\nOn 15 April 1987 the band started their first U.S. tour at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco. The tour ended in Philadelphia on 17 May 1987, as the band had been playing in 23 cities and traveling 14,565 km. A Swedish TV crew followed the band on the tour, producing the documentary \"Europe in America\", which would be shown on TV and released on video.\n\nEurope ended the Final Countdown Tour at the Roskilde Festival in Roskilde, Denmark on 4 July 1987.\n\nAnother Tempest-written song that was recorded during the sessions, \"On Broken Wings\", was used as a B-side on the \"Final Countdown\" single.\n\nInstrumental \"Where Men Won't Dare\", co-written by Tempest and John Levén, was an unfinished outtake which was included as a bonus feature on \"\" DVD.\n\nIn 2001, Sony released a remastered version of the album with expanded liner notes and three bonus tracks, live takes of \"The Final Countdown\", \"Danger on the Track\" and \"Carrie\", taken from the \"Final Countdown World Tour\" home video that was taped at Hammersmith Odeon in London 1987.\n\nIn 2019, Rock Candy Records released a remastered version with another three bonus tracks and expanded liner notes, a 1986 version of \"Seven Doors Hotel\", b-side remix of \"Rock the Night\" and \"On Broken Wings\"\n\nEurope\n\nProduction\n"}

The film stars Anthony Quinn as Barabbas, features Silvana Mangano, Katy Jurado, Arthur Kennedy, Harry Andrews, Ernest Borgnine, Vittorio Gassman, and Jack Palance, and was distributed by Columbia Pictures. It was conceived as a grand Roman epic, was based on Nobel Prize-winning Pär Lagerkvist's 1950 novel of the same title. A previous film version of the novel, in Swedish, had been made in 1953.\n\nThe film was directed by Richard Fleischer and shot in Verona and Rome under the supervision of producer Dino De Laurentiis. It included many spectacular scenes, including a battle of gladiators in a Cinecittà film studio mock-up of the arena, and a crucifixion shot during an actual total solar eclipse.\n\nPontius Pilate offers to release either Jesus of Nazareth or Barabbas, in keeping with the Passover custom. The crowd gathered for the pardoning chooses Barabbas, and Jesus is condemned to crucifixion. Returning to his friends, Barabbas asks for his lover, Rachel. His friends inform him that Rachel has become a follower of Christ. Rachel soon returns, but she is not happy to see Barabbas.\n\nBarabbas witnesses the crucifixion of Jesus. As Jesus dies, the sky turns black, and Barabbas is shaken. He watches Christ's body sealed in the tomb. On the third morning, Barabbas finds the tomb open. Rachel tells him that Christ has risen, but Barabbas says it is an illusion, or that His followers have stolen the body. He visits the apostles; they do not know where He is, but also believe He is risen.\n\nRachel preaches in Jerusalem about Christ Jesus himself. She is stoned to death at the insistence of the priests. Barabbas, guilt-ridden, returns to his criminal ways and tries to robs a caravan transporting several of the priests. When the robbery goes bad Barabbas does not try to flee, and he is captured by Roman soldiers. The law forbids Pilate from executing someone who has previously been pardoned, so he sentences Barabbas to lifelong slavery in the sulfur mines of Sicily.\n\nBarabbas survives this hellish existence for the next twenty years. He is chained to Sahak, a Christian sailor who was sent to the mines for allowing slaves to escape. Sahak at first hates Barabbas for being pardoned instead of \"the Master\", but the two men eventually become friends. Over time, Sahak becomes too weak to work. As the guards are about to kill him the mine is destroyed in an earthquake, and Sahak and Barabbas are the only survivors. Julia, the superstitious wife of the local prefect, considers them blessed. The prefect is due to leave for Rome, having been appointed to the Senate. Julia insists that Barabbas and Sahak accompany him for good luck.\n\nOnce in Rome, the men are trained to become gladiators by Torvald, the top gladiator in Rome. After a gladiatorial event, Sahak is overheard sharing his faith with other gladiators, and is condemned to death for treason. When a firing squad deliberately miss their thrown spears, Torvald executes Sahak. The next day, Torvald and Barabbas battle in the arena. Barabbas wins, killing Torvald and impressing Emperor Nero, who sets him free. Barabbas takes Sahak's corpse to the Catacombs, where the local Christians are worshiping. They give him a proper burial.\n\nBarabbas becomes lost in the Catacombs. When he eventually emerges, Rome is on fire. Barabbas is told that the Christians started the fire. Believing that the end of the world has come (as Rachel and Sahak had taught), Barabbas sets fire to more buildings. He is confronted by Roman soldiers and tells them that he is a follower of Christ. He is imprisoned with several other Christians, among them the apostle Peter. Peter admonishes Barabbas for committing arson, informing him that Christians would not do such a thing. Afterwards, the Christians are executed by mass crucifixion in the persecutions that follow the fire. Throughout his life, Barabbas was said to be the man who could not die. Having finally placed his faith in Christ, his body breathes its last.\n\n\nBefore major casting began, Yul Brynner was actively considered for the title role, yet never got the part. His previous Biblical film roles were The Pharaoh in \"The Ten Commandments\" and Solomon in \"Solomon and Sheba\".\n\nThe music score by Mario Nascimbene, which was conducted by Franco Ferrara, the noted conductor and lecturer on conducting at several famous international academies, was noted for its unusual, stark experimental component – the composer referred to his work, which included the introduction of electronic sounds achieved by the manipulation of tape speeds, as \"new sounds\". The depiction of the crucifixion was filmed on 15 February 1961 during an actual total eclipse of the sun.\n\n\"Barabbas\" received positive reviews; it currently holds an 89% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 9 reviews with an average rating of 6.8/10.\n\n\n\n"}

(Strategic Defense Initiative) is a 1986 action adventure computer game developed and published by Cinemaware. The game is set during the Cold War.\n\nThis game was released near the end of the Cold War. According to the game introduction screen, it takes place in October 2017 (and assumes the Soviet Union had not collapsed). The game uses the controversial Strategic Defense Initiative (S.D.I.) as its plot device. True to its name, Cinemaware also looked to Hollywood for some inspiration of the storyline. The storyline is reminiscent of several secret agent movies (such as the 007 films \"From Russia with Love\" and \"Moonraker\"). The game assumes that both the USSR and the United States have their own version of S.D.I. protecting their respective nations. The American station is never referred to by name. However, the manual and the in-game text indicate that the Soviet facility is called V. I. Lenin Defense Station. It is also mentioned that the Soviet station has laser cannons for defense against fighters.\n\nThe player takes the role of the commander-in-chief of the American SDI system, who according to the game manual is a Captain named Sloan McCormick, presumably in the United States Air Force. McCormick has his headquarters in the American space station, which monitors a network of twelve anti-missile satellites in geosynchronous orbit over the United States. The game's advertising blurb indicates that these American satellites employ particle beams. The plot states that Russian revolutionary extremists, led by discontented members of the KGB have gained control of several ICBMs, as well as space launch facilities needed for deploying manned orbital fighters. Because they have received no response to their demands for the Kremlin to surrender and for the Americans to abandon their SDI system, the revolutionaries have begun using their seized assets to periodically launch fighters against both space stations. They have also begun periodically firing waves of nuclear missiles at the United States. The player engages the enemy projectiles and enemy ships using a space-based fighter. The player must destroy the incoming missiles lest they wreak destruction upon the U.S. The player must also make repairs to the defense satellites that become damaged during the battles.\n\nLater in the game, the player continues the role of McCormick as, in order to finish the game, McCormick must make a desperate attempt to rescue his lover—he does not necessarily have to succeed. She is the Soviet station commander, and according to the manual her name is Natalia \"Talia\" Kazarian. She is placed in grave danger because her station is eventually boarded by the enemy forces, so McCormack must attempt to fight his way past them and reach Kazarian before she is killed. The manual even goes so far as to say that she is at risk of torture, but this is not shown. \"Kazarian\" is not an ethnic Russian name. The name is from Armenia, or, in the counterfactual universe of the game where the Soviet Union did not fall in 1991, from the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\n\"Antic\" stated that \"S.D.I.\" for the Atari ST was \"only partially successful\". Comparing portions to \"Star Raiders\" and \"Missile Command\", the magazine stated that it \"is a series of old arcade games strung together [without] depth\", criticizing the \"fairly repetitious\" gameplay and \"inconsistent\" joystick controls. The reviewer concluded, however, asking \"why do I find myself playing it again and again? I don't know, but once I get into it, it holds a bizarre fascination as few other games do. And if that's not a recommendation, I don't know what is\". \"Computer Gaming World\" praised the ST version, particularly for its touching ending sequences. The review also noted the game \"relies more on arcade elements than the other Cinemaware games\". \"Compute!\" praised the Atari ST version's graphics but called the gameplay repetitive. The Amiga version of the arcade game was reviewed in 1987 in \"Dragon\" #128 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.\n"}

They are called \"cellophane noodles\" or \"glass noodles\" because of their cellophane- or glass-like transparency when cooked.\nCellophane noodles should not be confused with rice vermicelli, which are made from rice and are white in color rather than clear (after cooking in water).\n\nCellophane noodles are made from a variety of starches. In China, cellophane noodles are usually made of mung bean starch. Chinese varieties made from mung bean starch are called Chinese vermicelli, bean threads, or bean thread noodles. Thicker Korean varieties made with sweet potato starch are called sweet potato noodles or dangmyeon.\n\nCellophane noodles are available in various thicknesses. Wide, flat cellophane noodle sheets called mung bean sheets are also produced in China. In Korea, napjak-dangmyeon (literally \"flat \"dangmyeon\"\") refers to flat sweet potato noodles.\n\nIn China, the primary site of production of cellophane noodles is the town of Zhangxing, in Zhaoyuan, Shandong province. However, historically the noodles were shipped through the port of Longkou, and thus the noodles are known and marketed as Longkou \"fensi\" ().\n\nIn Chinese, the most commonly used names are \"fěnsī\" (, literally \"noodle thread\") and \"dōngfěn\" (, literally \"winter noodle\"). They are also marketed under the name \"saifun\", the Cantonese pronunciation of the Mandarin \"xìfěn\" (; literally \"slender noodle\"), though the name \"fánsī\" (粉絲) is the term most often used in Cantonese.\n\nIn China, cellophane noodles are a popular ingredient used in stir fries, soups, and particularly hot pots. They can also be used as an ingredient in fillings for a variety of Chinese \"jiaozi\" (dumplings) and \"bing\" (flatbreads), especially in vegetarian versions of these dishes. Thicker cellophane noodles are also commonly used to imitate the appearance and texture of shark's fin in vegetarian soups. Thicker varieties, most popular in China's northeast, are used in stir fries as well as cold salad-like dishes. A popular soup using the ingredient is fried tofu with thin noodles (; Pinyin: \"yóu dòu fu-xiàn fěn tāng\"). A popular Sichuan dish called \"ants climbing a tree\" consists of stewed cellophane noodles with a spicy ground pork meat sauce.\n\nIn Tibetan cuisine of Tibet Autonomous Region, glass noodles are called \"phing\" or \"fing\" and are used in soup, pork curry or with mushrooms.\n\nIn Japanese cuisine, they are called \"harusame\" (), literally \"spring rain\". Unlike Chinese glass noodles, they are usually made from potato starch. They are commonly used to make salads, or as an ingredient in hot pot dishes. They are also often used to make Japanese adaptations of Chinese and Korean dishes. \"Shirataki\" noodles are translucent, traditional Japanese noodles made from the konjac yam and sometimes tofu.\n\nIn Korean cuisine, glass noodles are usually made from sweet potato starch and are called \"dangmyeon\" (Hangul: ; Hanja: ; literally \"Tang noodles\"; also spelled \"dang myun\", \"dangmyun\", \"tang myun\", or \"tangmyun\"). They are commonly stir-fried in sesame oil with beef and vegetables, and flavoured with soy and sugar, in a popular dish called \"japchae\" (hangul: 잡채). They are usually thick, and are a brownish-gray color when in their uncooked form.\n\nIn India and Pakistan, glass noodles are called \"falooda\" (see falooda, the dessert dish), and are served on top of \"kulfi\" (a traditional ice cream). They are usually made from arrowroot starch using a traditional technique. The noodles are flavorless so they provide a nice contrast with the sweet \"kulfi\". \"Kulfi\" and \"falooda\" can be bought from numerous food stalls throughout Pakistan and northern parts of India.\n\nIn Indonesian cuisine, they are called \"soun\" or \"suun\".\n\nIn Malaysia they are known as \"tanghoon\" (冬粉). They are sometimes confused with \"bihun\" (米粉) which are rice vermicelli. Sometimes also known as suhun or suhoon.\n\nIn Filipino cuisine, the noodles are called a similar name: \"sotanghon\" because of the popular dish of the same name made from them using chicken and wood ears. They are also confused with rice vermicelli, which is called \"bihon\" in the Philippines.\n\nIn Thai cuisine, glass noodles are called \"wun sen\" (). They are commonly mixed with pork and shrimp in a spicy salad called \"yam wun sen\" (), or stir-fried as \"phat wun sen\" ().\n\nIn Vietnamese cuisine, there are two varieties of cellophane noodles. The first, called \"bún tàu\" or \"bún tào\", are made from mung bean starch, and were introduced by Chinese immigrants. The second, called \"miến\" or \"miến dong\", are made from canna (), and were developed in Vietnam. These cellophane noodles are a main ingredient in the dishes: \"miến gà\", \"miến lươn\", \"miến măng vịt\", and \"miến cua\". These cellophane noodles are sometimes confused with rice vermicelli (Vietnamese: bún) and arrowroot starch noodles (Vietnamese: arrowroot: \"củ dong\", arrowroot starch: \"bột dong/bột hoàng tinh/bột mì tinh\").\n\nGlass noodles were introduced to Samoa by Cantonese agricultural workers in the early 1900s where they became known as \"\"lialia\"\", a Samoan word meaning \"to twirl\", after the method of twirling the noodles around chopsticks when eating. A popular dish called \"sapasui\" (transliteration of the Cantonese chop suey) is common fare at social gatherings. Sapasui, a soupy dish of boiled glass noodles mixed with braised pork, beef, or chicken and chopped vegetables, is akin to Hawaiian \"long rice\".\n\nIn Hawaii, where cuisine is heavily influenced by Asian cultures, cellophane noodles are known locally as long rice, supposedly because the process of making the noodles involves extruding the starch through a potato ricer. They are used most often in \"chicken long rice\", a dish of cellophane noodles in chicken broth that is often served at luaus.\n\nIn 2004, a number of companies producing Longkou cellophane noodles produced in Yantai, Shandong were discovered to be adulterated, with unscrupulous companies making noodles from cornstarch instead of green beans in order to reduce costs; the companies, to make the cornstarch transparent, were adding sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate and lead-based whiteners to their noodles. \n\nIn December 2010, Czech food inspection authorities (SZPI) again inspected Chinese cellophane noodles, this time determining that of aluminium had been used in the production of the noodles. Above is an illegal amount for noodles in Czech and EU markets (see Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 and its amendments (EU) No 187/2011, 618/2013 annex I).\n\n\n"}

The group's sound was influenced by the doom metal and sludge metal genres and in particular by bands such as Grief, Black Sabbath and Eyehategod.\n\nIn 1996, the group wrote a six-song EP that was released on the small imprint Union Mill. It was reissued in 1997 when the band signed to Nottingham label Earache Records. Before the deal was made however guitarist Watson was fired and replaced by Dean Berry. The band's second release \"Our Problem\" received high acclaim. In July 1999, the band released a split CD/10\" with Japanese doom metal band Church of Misery that was put out by Man's Ruin Records.

{"id": "1821212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821212", "title": "Kato Airline", "text": "Kato Airline\n\nKato Airline AS, trading as Kato Air, was an airline which operated in Northern Norway between 1995 and 2008. Although also operating some smaller aircraft, the main portion of the airline's fleet were two Dornier Do 228. The airline was based at the grounds of Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes in Evenes.\n\nCommercial operations began in 1996. An early contract was fling newspapers out of Harstad. During 1999 the airline took delivery of two Do 228s and started a scheduled service from Harstad/Narvik to Bodø and Tromsø. The route was not viable and closed later that year. In the process Kato Air took over the fixed-wing operations of Helitrans and set up a base at Trondheim Airport, Værnes. Instead the airline focused on charter to oil companies, particularly flying charters from Trondheim to Brønnøysund.\n\nThe airline won the public service obligations from Bodø to Røst and to Narvik Airport, Framnes in 2003. Later the year they also won a major contract with Norway Post. The airline suffered two serious incidents. A Do 228 crashed and was written off after a lightning strike on 4 December 2003. A scheduled service was hijacked on 29 September 2004. The Brønnøysund, Framnes and newspaper routes were all lost in 2006, after which the company fell into financial difficulties. The maintenance certificate was withdrawn on 28 August 2008 and the airline ceased operations on 1 September.\n\nKato Air was incorporated on 16 February 1995. However, not until 21 February 1996 did it receive an air operator's certificate for general aviation. In the intermediate period the airline cooperated with another airline. The airline established a base at Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes, as the first airline to be based at the airport. The company was founded and owned by Karl Johan Karlsen, acting as chairman, and his wife Torlaug Karlsen, the managing director. \"Kato\" is derived from the first two letters from their respective first names. The fleet started off with a Piper PA-31 Chieftain and a Cessna 172 in 1995. The following year the airline bought a Maule M-5 and a Cessna 208 was procured in 1997.\n\nBy 1997, 15 million Norwegian krone had been invested in the airline. Its first permanent contract was with \"Verdens Gang\" to distribute printed newspaper from the press in Harstad to Bodø and Troms]. Later the arrangement was extended to also include the distribution of \"Dagbladet\". The company had a revenue of 6.3 million Norwegian krone in 1997, making a profit of one million. The company sourced seventy percent of its revenue from the newspaper contracts. The main \"ad hoc\" charter contractors were the Norwegian Geological Survey and the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management. A Piper PA-34 Seneca was added to the fleet in 1998.\nKato Air announced plans in October 1998 to establish a scheduled route from Harstad/Narvik to Bodø and Tromsø. The background was the Widerøe was no longer flying this route. Kato Air cooperated with the Stjørdal-based airline Helitrans, who had a surplus of Dornier Do 228. One of these was taken over by Kato Air, who christened it \"Bjørnfjell\"; the other was leased. They had 16 and 19 seats, respectively. The route commenced on 7 December 1998. Each leg had a morning and afternoon round trip on weekdays, as well as an evening flight on Sundays. Kato Air bought ground services from Scandinavian Airlines at Harstad/Narvik and from Widerøe in Bodø and Tromsø. The arrangement ultimately resulted in Kato Air taking over the entire fixed-wing division of Helitrans, who remained with only helicopter operations. Patronage on the route was too low to keep the route running, and it was terminated in November 1999. A contributing factor was an imported fast ferry service to Tromsø.\n\nThe Dorniers were subsequently mostly used for charters with oil companies, with Statoil being a dominant customer. Of particular importance was a charter route with the oil company from Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Brønnøysund Airport, Brønnøy. For a period starting in February 2002 the airline also flew a charter route from Trondheim to Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget.\n\nStarting 1 April 2003 Kato Airline took over two public service obligation routes, which received subsidies from the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Both were out of Bodø, one to Røst Airport and the other to Narvik Airport, Framnes—the downtown airport serving Narvik. The same year the airline won four-year contract with Norway Post to operate postal flights from Trondheim to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø. Kato Airline was allowed to operate the route with a Dornier Do 228, a significantly smaller aircraft than the incumbent de Havilland Canada Dash 8 used by Widerøe. By December both routes had seen a drastic fall in patronage. Røst Municipal Council came with a statement criticizing the ministry for allowing such aircraft, stating that the lacked among other amenities accessibility, pressure cabin, weather radar, space for hand luggage and that the airline did not operate with discount tickets. The company's revenue peaked at 61 million kroner in 2003.\n\nAfter failing to make a profit on the Narvik route, Kato Air announced in late 2004 that it would terminate operations on the route from 8 March 2005. No companies bid to fly the route, and so the ministry entered negotiations with Kato Airline to continue operations. This resulted in the fee for the remaining thirteen months increasing from 8 million to 18.2 million kroner. By 2006 the patronage at Narvik Airport, Framnes had halved in the three years the route was operated by Kato Airline.\n\nDuring late 2005 Kato Air lost three important contracts, both the newspaper flights, the Statoil flights and the Narvik contract. However, they won a new three-year contract to operate the route to Røst, running from 1 April 2006 through 31 March 2009. The loss of business ultimately led to a loss of 10 million kroner in 2007 and put the company under severe financial pressure. This led the company to increase its \"ad hoc\" business, which included winning the contract for the organization of the 2007 Dakar Rally. The airline made several bids to win more routes. They applied in 2006 for both PSO contracts in Finnmark, but failed to match the bid from Widerøe.\n\nFollowing an inspection, the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway withdrew Kato Air Service's aircraft maintenance certificate on 28 August 2008. They citied several severe breaches of regulation and routines. Subsequently, the board decided on 1 September to liquidate the company.\n\nThe following is a list of scheduled destinations served by Kato Airline.\n\n"}

These units were generally organised along British Army lines. The first locally raised militia in Hong Kong was the Hong Kong Volunteers, a fore runner of what was to become the Royal Hong Kong Regiment (The Volunteers).\n\nAlthough the British government, as national government, was responsible for the defence of the territories and colonies, and held direct control of military units raised within them, the local forces were raised and funded by the local governments or the territories and as such the RHKR(V) was always a branch of the Hong Kong government. It was not a part of the reserve force of the British Army. The RHKR(V) did however form part of the order of battle of 48 Gurkha Infantry Brigade and were under command of the commander of the British forces in Hong Kong.\n\nThese locally raised defence units met British military standards in organisation and efficiency. Many of the officers and NCOs attended training in the UK. Although colonial/overseas British territories' auxiliary units could have no tasking under the British Ministry of Defence, and members could not be compelled to serve outside their territory, many served voluntarily on attachment to British Regular and Territorial Army units.\n\nThe regiment should not be confused with the separate Hong Kong Regiment formed in 1892, which was a regular infantry regiment of the British Army, recruited in India.\n\nThe Hong Kong Volunteers was formed in 1854 when the Crimean War led to a reduction of the British military presence in Hong Kong. To help bolster the defences at a time when marauding pirates were still a hazard on the China coast a call for local volunteers was made. A total of 99 Europeans were recruited, mostly British but with some Portuguese, Scandinavians and Germans also answering the call. However almost as soon as it was founded, it was disbanded when the threat of war in Europe receded, and Regular units of the British Army were once again able to resume responsibility for the security of Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1862, the Hong Kong Volunteers was re-established, and in 1864 they were called out to help subdue a serious outbreak of rioting between British and Indian soldiers. In 1866 it was disbanded again. In 1878, the Hong Kong Volunteers was reborn as the \"Hong Kong Artillery and Rifle Volunteer Corps\". By 1917, it was renamed as the \"Hong Kong Defence Corps\" was actively engaged in guard and patrol duties during World War I when, owing to the recall of the British forces, they were the only military unit left in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1933, the Hong Kong Defence Corps acquired their first armoured car, equipped with an armour-plated body and mountings for two machine-guns. Later, four others were bought by the colonial government. The bodywork was outfitted by the Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company. These armoured cars played an important role in the Battle of Hong Kong in December 1941.\n\nThe Hong Kong Defence Corps, renamed the \"Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps\" (HKVDC), met their severest test in the bitter fighting that took place in the crucial weeks before the fall of Hong Kong on Christmas Day 1941. On 8 December 1941, the HKVDC, deployed a total fighting strength of 2200 all ranks in 7 infantry companies, 5 artillery batteries, 5 machine gun companies equipped with Vickers machine gun and an armoured car platoon.\n\nWhile only seeing light action in the New Territories at the beginning of the Japanese attack, the Volunteers were heavily engaged on Hong Kong Island, especially during the key battles of Wong Nai Chung Gap and Stanley. Casualties among 3 Coy at the former, and 1 Bty at the latter, were extremely heavy. 1 and 2 (Scottish) companies also suffered heavy losses, as did 5 Bty.\n\nOut of the mobilised strength of 2200, 289 were listed either as missing or killed, and many others became prisoners of war. Some, however, made their way into China where the British Army Aid Group was formed to assist the Chinese Government in the struggle against the Japanese. A number of these men later joined the Hong Kong Volunteer Company in Burma, where they were attached to the Chindits under General Orde Wingate. The services of the defence corps were later recognised by the award of 19 decorations and 18 mentioned in despatch for gallantry and good service. As a recognition of The Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps defence of Hong Kong during 1941, the Corps was awarded the battle honour \"Hong Kong\".\n\nIn 1949, The Hong Kong Regiment were reorganised and became part of the Hong Kong Defence Force, which also included separate air and naval units. In 1951 the new combined defence force was granted the title 'Royal', and replacement colours were entrusted to the care of the regiment as successor to the defunct Defence Corps.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the role of the Royal Hong Kong Defence Force changed from that of an infantry battalion to a reconnaissance regiment equipped with six British Ferret armoured cars (each armed with Browning .30-inch machine-gun) were acquired. The regiment was reorganise to form a headquarters, headquarters squadron, three reconnaissance squadrons, an infantry company and a home guard company. During the 1967 leftist riots, the Royal Hong Kong Defence Force were called out during the six-month disturbances in Hong Kong.\n\nBy 1970 the naval unit was phased out and in 1970 the Royal Hong Kong Defence Force was itself disbanded – the two remaining member units, the Hong Kong Regiment and the Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force, officially becoming separate entities. At the same time, both were granted the 'Royal' title by Queen Elizabeth II, and the words 'The Volunteers' were incorporated into the Hong Kong Regiment's title. With its new title and colours, the RHKR(V) was reorganised as a light reconnaissance unit operating under the command of the British Forces Overseas Hong Kong.\n\nIn the late 1970s the Volunteers were deployed to assist the civil powers over the problem of illegal immigration from China; as the problem grew from 1980 till 1992 the Volunteers were deployed to man the defences of the Chinese-Hong Kong border. In the late 1980s to early 1990s the Volunteers were deployed to support the colonial government in controlling the flood of Vietnamese illegal migrants, commonly known as the \"Boat People\". This included guarding temporary detention camps for Vietnamese migrants.\n\nThe regiment included several units:\n\n\nThe Sino-British Joint Declaration on the question of Hong Kong as a British colony was finalised and the joint declaration was signed in Beijing on 19 December 1984. On 27 May 1985, instruments of ratification were exchanged and the agreement entered into force. It was registered at the United Nations by the British and Chinese Governments on 12 June 1985.\n\nIn April 1992 the Security Branch of the Hong Kong Government formally announced that the Regiment would disband in September 1995.\n\n\nList of vehicles used by regiment from 1920s to 1960s:\n\n\n\nThe regiment's badge at disbandment consisted of:\n\n\nEarlier badges had a Tudor crown and the Volunteer Corps had no Oriental features:\n\n\nThe J Corps was a youth organisation created by the RHKR(V) in 1971 and now renamed Hong Kong Adventure Corps.\n\nThe RHKR(V)RP was an internal police force within the RHKR(V) to provide security and law and order within the regiment.\n\nCreated in 1995 as a charitable organization to support former members in Hong Kong with a Club House located at the Hong Kong Jockey Club Happy Valley racecourse.\n\n\n"}

It is located on the south of the island, roughly halfway between the island's eastern and western ends. Located in the county of Middlesex, it is bordered by Manchester on the west, Saint Catherine in the east, and in the north by Saint Ann. Its capital and largest town is May Pen.\n\nClarendon was named in honour of the Lord Chancellor Sir Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon. The most recent parish was formed from a combination of three parishes: St. Dorothy's, Vere and the old parish of Clarendon. Before the merger, the capital was Chapelton. Clarendon Parish was one of the original seven Anglican parishes of Jamaica set up by Sir Thomas Modyford in 1664, and it has been reorganized numerous times since. Parish registers, which are records kept by the parish church of religious events such as baptisms, marriages, and burials, are still extant from Clarendon parish almost as far back as its foundation, with the first recorded baptism dated in 1666.\n\nCovering an area of 1,196 km, Clarendon ranks as Jamaica's third largest parish. The parish is predominantly a wide plain, marked by several rivers, including the Rio Minho, which runs the length of the parish. Toward the northern end of the parish lies the Mocho Mountains, (2000 ft), and Bull Head Mountain range (2800 ft), which is considered to be the geographical centre of the island. The Vere plain is another significant geographical feature.\n\nPortland Point, the southernmost point of Jamaica, is on a peninsula in Clarendon which also hosts Portland Point Lighthouse. On the same peninsula are Jackson Bay beach, the flood-prone community of Portland Cottage, and two different locations both called Rocky Point: a residential community on the western side of the peninsula, and a port used primarily for the export of alumina on the eastern side of the peninsula.\n\nWith a population at an estimated 246,322, Clarendon is one of the most populous parishes in the island. May Pen, the capital, has a population estimated at around 60,000.\n\n\nBauxite, Jamaica's major mineral source, can be found extensively in Clarendon. Bauxite mining has been established in the parish by JAMALCO and ALCOA. Most of the island's tobacco is also grown in Clarendon, along with cotton, allspice (colloquially referred to as pimento), ginger, livestock, indigo, bananas, coffee, and cocoa. May Pen is also an important citrus packing centre, famous for 'Trout Hall' oranges. Additionally, dairy farming, fish farming, and copper mining have been carried on intermittently, and the sugar-cane production contributes significantly to the amount of sugar exported annually. The Denbigh agricultural showground is on the outskirts of May Pen.\n\nOne of the top ten credit unions in Jamaica, GSB Co-operative Credit Union has a branch here.\n\nClarendon is the location of the Milk River Bath, a mineral spa famous for the therapeutic value of its waters. The oldest church on the island is in Alley, the old capital of Vere.\n\nHalse Hall Great House is one of the island's historic houses. The land on which the house stands was given to an English officer, Major Thomas Halse, in 1655, and was passed from him to Francis Sadler Halse. Halse played a leading role in the Maroon Wars.\n\nThe Denbigh Agricultural Show Grounds – once a year, on the weekend prior to Independence celebrations, a national Agriculture Show is staged here.\n\nVernamfield was the first car-racing track established in Jamaica. The track is located on the former American lend lease air base, Vernam Field (later Vernam Air Force Base) that was named in honor of World War I flyer Remington de B. Vernam. Vernam Field is known for drag racing.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1821232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821232", "title": "Parelaphostrongylus tenuis", "text": "Parelaphostrongylus tenuis\n\nParelaphostrongylus tenuis (also known as meningeal worm or brainworm) is a neurotropic nematode parasite common to white-tailed deer, \"Odocoileus virginianus\", which causes damage to the central nervous system. Moose (\"Alces alces\"), elk (\"Cervus canadensis\"), caribou (\"Rangifer tarandus\"), mule deer (\"Odocoileus hemionus\"), and others are also susceptible to the parasite, but are aberrant hosts and are infected in neurological instead of meningeal tissue. The frequency of infection in these species increases dramatically when their ranges overlap high densities of white-tailed deer.\n\nThe lifecycle begins in infected meningeal tissues in the central nervous system (CNS) where adult brainworms lay eggs. The eggs are dislodged from the CNS and pass into the lungs, where they hatch. The larvae are then coughed up, swallowed, and proceed through the gastrointestinal tract. Snails and slugs then serve as intermediate hosts, which are later eaten by ungulates, allowing the process to continue. Changes in climate and habitat beginning in the early 1900s have expanded range overlap between white-tailed deer and moose, increasing the frequency of infection within the moose population to the concern of wildlife managers.\n\nThe lifecycle of \"P. tenuis\" is complex and multistaged.\n\nAdults lay eggs on the dura mater (the outer layer of the meninges) of the brain or directly into the bloodstream of an infected host. The eggs hatch into first-stage larvae, which travel in the bloodstream to the lungs, where they travel up the respiratory tract, are swallowed, and then pass out of the body in the mucus coating of fecal pellets.\n\nGastropods such as snails and slugs feed upon the mucus coating of the fecal pellets and ingest the larvae. While in the gastropod, the larvae develop into second- and third-stage larvae, which are capable of infection.\n\nGastropods carrying second- and third-stage larvae may be accidentally ingested with plants, which results in the larvae being transmitted to a new host. The larvae then move into the new host's stomach wall and make their way to the CNS, as in white-tailed deer, or the brain as in other ungulates. Once in these tissues, they develop into their adult third stage of life and lay eggs to begin the cycle again.\n\nAdults of \"P. tenuis\" can persist for many years in a single host, which allows for many first-stage larvae to be shed in feces. It is quite common in many populations of white-tailed deer, which have built up a strong resistance. After gastropod ingestion, moose or other deer may be hosts of the second- and third-stage worms. Moose resistance to \"P. tenuis\" is much lower than white-tailed deer, which results in a higher mortality rate.\n\nInfected deer density, temperature, climate conditions, and length of transmission periods all affect transmission levels.\n\nBrainworm affects neurological and behavioral responses. Deer rarely show any external symptoms of\" P. tenius\" infection due to their high acquired resistance. Moose, however, have low resistance, and may show a number of symptoms. Though infrequent, cases of moose recovering from brainworm infection have been reported. In both deer and moose, symptom severity does not necessarily vary with severity of infection.\n\n\nSeveral other ungulates are susceptible to brainworm infection, including elk, caribou, mule deer, sheep, goats, alpacas, rarely cattle, and rarely horses. Severe neurological damage similar to that of infected moose is shown to occur in these species.\n\nPresently, a commercial antibody test that can detect \"P. tenuis\" antemortem does not exist. Diagnosis in deer can be conducted by analyzing fecal pellets for larval \"P. tenuis\", or \"post mortem\" necropsy to detect presence of adult \"P. tenuis\" in the brain cavity or second- and third-stage worms along the spinal cord. However, brainworm larvae are difficult to distinguish from other parasitic worm species that can also be found in fecal pellets, so detection of adult worms through necropsy is recommended. Diagnosis in moose is conducted with necropsy to detect worms in the brain or spinal cord. Diagnosis in horses can be conducted with postmortem samples used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Positive PCR results show evidence of \"P.\" \"tenuis\" infecting equines. In veterinary patients, such as goats, an eosinophilic pleocytosis can be suggestive of \"P. tenuis\" infection.\n\nIn 1912, an unknown neurological disease affecting moose was first reported in Minnesota. Major declines in the moose population were reported, 1925–27 and 1933–34, following the discovery of this unknown disease. In 1963, a meningeal brainworm, \"Pneumostrongylus tenuis\", was determined as the etiological agent causing neurological disease in moose. Around 1971, taxonomists reclassified it as \"Parelaphostrongylus tenuis\".\n\nWhite-tailed deer populations in the eastern United States are now known to be commonly infected with meningeal worm. Infection in the southeastern and western United States is less common. This disease has also been found in the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia. The grassland biomes of the United States and Canada apparently act as a barrier to the movement of the disease. Evidence from Canada seems to support this, since the western distribution of meningeal worm has changed little since the 1960s.\n\nThe geographic ranges of moose and white-tailed deer were historically separate prior to the 20th century. Moose are well adapted to winter survival, whereas deer are not. They could not withstand the harsh winters in these regions of the northeastern United States and the southeastern provinces of Canada. Deer populations began to move into the southern portions of moose range in the early 1900s following changes in climate, logging, mining, forest fires, and increasing human development. High-quality deer habitat associated with these changes has led to dramatic increases in deer abundance in these regions.\n\nWhite-tailed deer are the normal host of the \"P. tenuis\" parasite and are immunologically adapted to its presence. Deer and \"P. tenuis\" have coadapted in an evolutionary arms race over time. Deer remain largely unaffected by the presence of \"P. tenuis\" because of the immunity they have built as a result of coadaptation. The prevalence and infection rate of \"P. tenuis\" in deer is density dependent; increased rates of infection by the parasite are the result of higher deer densities.\n\nMoose populations on the southern fringes of their range have recently experienced dramatic declines. As deer encroached upon the southern fringes of moose range, they introduced the parasite to a naïve host, the moose. Upon transmission of the pathogen into moose, the worm causes cerebrospinal nematodiasis, a disease of the nervous system that often results in death. \"P. tenuis\" may be one factor that has contributed to moose declines in southern portions of their range. This disruption of host-pathogen dynamics due to habitat alterations has promoted the spread of this parasite to a naïve host and has potentially contributed to declines in moose abundance and productivity in regions with high deer densities. Continued increase in deer abundance and density in the southern fringes of moose range are predicted to facilitate sustained transmission of \"P. tenuis\" to moose. Continued transmission of deer-related parasites, coupled with low productivity, habitat degradation, and a northward shift in the moose thermonuetral zone, leads to a troubling prognosis for southern moose populations. Murray et al. (2006) predict, if current trends continue, moose populations in these regions will not be viable and population declines will persist.\n\nCurrently, there is no definitive treatment for \"P. tenuis\" in mammals, though research is still being conducted\".\" The use of anthelmintics (ivermectin and fenbendazole) have been attempted in white-tailed deer. The results indicate, however, that ivermectin was ineffective against larvae that had already reached the spinal cord. Fenbendazole and ivermectin, combined with anti-inflammatory therapy have been used to manage infections in goats.\n\nThe majority of moose brainworm research in North America has been conducted in northern Minnesota, where a historical moose population of 4,000 to 5,000 moose had declined to an estimated 1,200 individuals by 1997. In this region, wildlife managers are challenged to predict and attempt to mitigate moose declines resulting from deer-related pathogens. Because no effective methods to prevent the transmission or infection of brainworm in moose have been found, managers have focused their efforts on decreasing deer densities in these regions. The Minnesota DNR identified that population densities greater than 12 deer/square mile result in increased moose mortality as a result of brainworm. Managers in these areas are responsible for evaluating suitable habitat for moose and deer, as well as setting management priorities and population goals to decrease the transmission of \"Parelaphostrongylus tenuis\" in moose. Though the main focus of research has been on white-tailed deer and moose, research has found that the guinea pig can be used as an experimental model of \"P. tenuis\" infection.\n"}

The company markets several lines of hard drives with a capacity of up to many terabytes of data, with a choice of interfaces (FireWire 400, FireWire 800, eSATA, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, Thunderbolt, and Ethernet). LaCie also has a series of mobile bus-powered hard drives.\n\nLaCie's computer display product line is targeted specifically to graphics professionals, with an emphasis on color matching.\n\nLaCie began life as two separate computer storage companies: in 1989 as électronique d2 in Paris, France, and in 1987 as LaCie in Tigard, Oregon (later Portland, Oregon), USA.\n\nIn 1995, électronique d2 acquired La Cie, and later adopted the name 'LaCie' for all of its operations. At the early founding stages of both companies, both focused their businesses on IT storage solutions, based on the SCSI interface standard for connecting external devices to computers. SCSI was adopted by Apple Computer as its main peripheral interface standard and the market for both LaCie and d2 became closely, but not exclusively, associated with the Macintosh platform.\n\nIn Europe, the French company \"électronique d2\" was founded in 1989 by Pierre Fournier and Philippe Spruch, working from their apartment in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. d2's main activity was assembling hard drives in external SCSI casings and selling them as peripheral devices.\n\nBy 1990, the company had outgrown its small beginnings and moved to new 900 square meter premises in rue Watt, also in Paris. By this stage, designing casings was no longer sufficient for d2 to maintain a competitive edge, and so the company began to develop its own products and invest in R&D. d2 began to open subsidiaries around Europe, the first in London in 1991, followed by offices in Brussels and Copenhagen. The company began to expand its business beyond the Mac market and target PC users. In 1995, électronique d2 acquired the US company La Cie, a subsidiary of Quantum. LaCie was operating in the same market niche as électronique d2, and the buyout gave d2 a foothold into the North American market. In 1998, it was decided to adopt the name LaCie as a worldwide brand, dropping the d2 name from its product range (although even today, several products still retain reference to it).\n\nIn the United States, La Cie, Ltd. (La Cie) was founded in July 1987 in Tigard, Oregon, USA. Joel Kamerman, his parents Robert and Tudy Kamerman, and Roger Bates founded La Cie. Joel Kamerman was La Cie's president and general manager from July 1987 through January 1997.\n\nJoel Kamerman founded La Cie on three principles:\n\n• Profit was more important than revenue\n\n• Product differentiation would create profit\n\n• Vertical integration was key to La Cie's long term viability\n\nLa Cie's objective was to create premier products and differentiate the company through industrial design and value added software.\n\nIn the US, La Cie was acquired by Plus Development, a subsidiary of the storage manufacturer Quantum in December 1990. As a subsidiary of Quantum, La Cie was licensed as the exclusive manufacturer of Apple-branded external SCSI hard drives, using Quantum hard disks. Joel Kamerman and Scott Phillips negotiated the deal between Apple Computer and La Cie. After the 1995 acquisition of La Cie by électronique d2, company management was headed by Philippe Spruch, who continues to head the combined company as of December 2013.\n\nSeagate Technology announced in March 2012 it would purchase LaCie for $186 million, with the transaction expected to close in 2014. In August 2013, the US headquarters were moved back to Tigard.\n\n\nLaCie's original business was external SCSI hard drives, but its range has expanded over the years to include early CD writers, some of the first DVD drives, magneto-optical drives, SyQuest drives, tape backup, RAID arrays, and mobile USB and FireWire drives.\n\nDuring the 1980s, little attention was paid to design aesthetic of computers and peripherals to it.\n\nDesign – if any – was minimalistic, and tended towards beige metal boxes with no frills.\n\nBecause d2's original target market was Apple Macintosh users – many who tended to work in creative, artistic professions – such as designers, printers, digital video artists, etc., d2 tailored its products much more carefully – by offering \"designer drives\" to satisfy the tastes of these \"content creators\" than other manufacturers were doing.\n\nPrior to the électronique d2 buyout in 1995, Ziba Design, in Portland Oregon, designed the majority of LaCie's products, including the award winning Joule tower, the Cirrus and the Tsunami drive. By 1995 LaCie had won awards for industrial design for every external storage product they introduced.\n\nIn Paris, France, électronique d2 began to make a name for itself as early as 1991 by hiring designers like Philippe Starck and Neil Poulton. The emphasis was on ergonomics, distinctive moulding and some radically different designs.\n\nThe French designer Philippe Starck designed three products for the company: \"K1\", \"Apollo\" and \"Tokyo\". These three \"toaster\" drives were manufactured in gravity-cast, hand polished aluminium and gained their nickname because of a passing resemblance to 1950s chrome toasters. Neil Poulton and Christophe Pillet, then Starck employees and both future LaCie designers, ran the projects. A fourth Starck-designed product was completed to model stage in 1992 but was never manufactured.\n\nIndustrial designer Neil Poulton has the longest running history with électronique d2/LaCie. From 1991 onwards, Scottish-born Poulton designed numerous products for d2, including the \"Shark' and \"FM Tuner' and the award-winning, phallic \"le Coq\" hard drive. Poulton also designed d2's graphics, literature, packaging, trade fair booths, and the two électronique d2 logos. When d2 bought out LaCie in 1995, Poulton was brought in to design the current LaCie logo and the company's corporate identity.\n\nPoulton is responsible for the design of the best-selling \"d2\" range, the \"Pocketdrive\" range, the \"Rugged\" drive, the \"Little Big Disk' and numerous professional and \"unsigned\" d2/LaCie products dating back to 1991. His funnel-inspired \"Firewire Speakers\" won the French \"Janus de l'Industrie' award in 2007.\n\nChristophe Pillet, better known for his high-end furniture, designed products for d2 /LaCie from 1994-96 after quitting Philippe Starck's office.\n\nIn 2003, Philippe Spruch commissioned an agency to identify the world's \"best known\" design studio. He then hired the world-famous Porsche Design company to design a product range which would become best-sellers for LaCie between 2003-6.\n\nA spate of colorful products released in 2006 included Karim Rashid's \"shocking\" dayglo products and the popular Brick drive designed by Frenchman Ora-Ito. Never far from controversy, Ito's award winning USB Hub of 2007 had to be renamed to avoid infringement with the original name.\n\nIn 2007, the French national museum, Centre Georges Pompidou, in Paris acquired LaCie products for its permanent collection including Poulton's \"le Coq\", \"d2\",\" LBD\", \"Firewire Speakers\", \"Pocketdrive\" and \"Rugged\", Ito's \"Brick\" and \"USB Hub\", and two Porsche Design drives.\n\nPoulton and Ito continue to work as designers for LaCie.\n\nLaCie developed the first universal disk formatting software for SCSI drives, Silverlining.\n\nLaCie was one of the first companies to include switchable, built-in termination with their Cirrus, Tsunami, and ZFP SCSI drives for Macintosh computers.\n\n"}
{"id": "1821240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821240", "title": "Access Software", "text": "Access Software\n\nAccess Software, Inc. was an American video game developer based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Founded in November 1982 by Bruce Carver and Chris Jones, the company created the \"Beach Head\", \"Links\" and \"Tex Murphy\" series, as well as \"Raid over Moscow\". Access Software was acquired by Microsoft in April 1999, transitioning in name twice before being acquired by Take-Two Interactive in October 2004, receiving the name Indie Built. In January 2005, Access Software became part of Take-Two's 2K label. Following a poor financial performance at Take-Two, Indie Built was closed down in May 2006.\n\nTruGolf, a company that develops indoor golf simulators, was formerly a subsidiary of Access Software based on the display technology they had made for the \"Links\" games and spun out to its own company during the Microsoft acquisition. Following the closure by Take-Two, many of the studio's developers went to TruGolf. Separately, Jones has established Big Finish Games to continue the \"Tex Murphy\" series.\n\nIn 1982, Bruce Carver, an engineer for Salt Lake City-based company Redd Engineering, created a sprite-editing program called Spritemaster. He presented the product to Steve Witzel, who operated Computers Plus, a retail computer store in Salt Lake City's Midvale suburb; Witzel provided Carver with several improvement suggestions for the program. After Carver had implemented these changes, he began selling them under the name \"Access Software\" through Computers Plus. The name was chosen Carver and some of his friends had searched through a dictionary, considering \"Action Software\" and \"Center Soft\" before sticking with \"Access Software\". In November that year, Carver, together with Chris Jones, incorporated Access Software with a starting capital of . In its early days, Access Software operated out of Carver's basement.\n\nOne of Access' key products were a series of sprite-based golfing games in the \"Links\". In 1984, while there were other golf games on the market, most used a top-down approach, while Bruce Carver wanted to create a game that was shown from behind the golfer. With little artistic skill among their team, the developers set up a small studio in the basement, projecting frame-by-frame VHS footage of Roger Carver's golf swing onto a clear sheet, tracing his outline onto the sheets as to then convert them into sprites within the Commodore 64 system. This became the basis of \"Leader Board\", the first game considered part of the \"Links\" series, and would establish the behind-the-golfer view for most other golf simulation games that followed. As Access continued to develop the \"Links\" games for computers, they established a subsidiary, TruGolf, that created golf simulators, with Roger Carver overseeing this division.\n\nOn April 19, 1999, Access Software was acquired by Microsoft for an undisclosed sum. Microsoft sought to acquire Access to gain its \"Links\" series of golf games; Access had created \"Microsoft Golf\" as one of the first games to run within the Microsoft Windows operating system based on \"Links 386 Pro\". According to Steve Witzel, Microsoft looked to acquire Access after \"USA Today\" reviewed both \"Microsoft Golf\" and \"Links\" and rated the latter much higher; Microsoft thought it would be easier to buy Access than try to compete. Microsoft desired to produce a high-end line of golf games based on \"Links\" with Access, while offering \"Microsoft Golf\" as lower-budget titles. With the acquisition, Access's principal offices remained in Salt Lake City. Access divested itself of the TruGolf division and made the company its own entity with Microsoft's purchase.\n\nUpon the formation of Microsoft Game Studios (then called Microsoft Games) in 2000, Microsoft rebranded Access Software as Salt Lake Games Studio. Initially working on products to for the personal computer, Salt Lake City Studio transitioned to Xbox versions of \"Links\" as well as the \"\" snowboarding and \"Top Spin\" tennis sports games, following the console's introduction in 2002.\n\nIn 2003, Microsoft rebranded Salt Like Games Studio as Indie Games. That year, Carver left the company to pursue new interests, eventually founding Carver Homes, a construction company, in 2004. He later died from cancer on December 28, 2005.\n\nAround 2004, Microsoft opted to leave the sports-game development market due to the impact of the Electronic Arts Sports (EA Sports) label, using their strength to produce sports-related games for the Xbox console. Microsoft had laid off about 76 employees with Microsoft Game Studios in 2004, and around August and September 2004, sold Indie Games to Take-Two Interactive, who renamed the studio to Indie Built. Take-Two had been keen on challenging the dominance of EA Sports, and its acquisition of Indie Built was among it had spent through 2005 acquiring developers. In early 2005, Take-Two Interactive established the publishing label 2K, which would henceforth manage their development studios for sports games, including Indie Built.\n\nWhile part of Take-Two, Indie Built created sequels for \"Amped\" and \"Top Spin\", but these titles were not strong successes. Take-Two's 2006 fiscal year was poor as the company was dealing with both Security and Exchange Commission investigations related to its past reporting, and harsh criticism for the \"Hot Coffee\" mod as part of \"\". Indie Built was closed on May 2006 by Take-Two as part of a re-alignment of their business strategy to overcome the weak 2006 fiscal year.\n\nFollowing Indie Built's closure, most of the employees transitioned to TruGolf, helping to improve the golf simulations. Additionally, Jones and Conners established Big Finish Games in 2007, where they planned to continue more narrative games, including expanding the \"Tex Murphy\" series.\n"}

It was a joint production of the BBC in the United Kingdom and PBS member station WGBH Boston in the United States. The series was first shown on BBC in the 1995, 1996 and 1997 television seasons before being shown elsewhere in the world and before being broadcast in the US in 1998.\n\nThe 26 one-hour episodes examined the socio-economic, political, and cultural movements that shaped the 20th century.\nThe series represented a departure from documentaries that present history through recounting the actions of great men; \"People's Century\" considers the century from the perspective of common people. Most of those interviewed were ordinary men and women who closely witnessed various events and who give personal accounts of the manner in which the developments and disruptions of the 20th century affected their lives.\n\nThe British version was narrated by Sean Barrett and Veronika Hyks, the American version by actors John Forsythe and Alfre Woodard. \"People's Century\" was co-produced by the BBC and WGBH with executive producers Peter Pagnamenta and Zvi Dor-Ner, respectively, along with producer David Espar.\n\nThe opening credits depict various images from the century, accompanied with a theme music score by Zbigniew Preisner. The documentary won an International Emmy Award, among others.\n\n\"People's Century\" was broadcast in several non-English-speaking countries, for example Norway (with subtitles, Norwegian television is nearly always texted, not dubbed). In Germany, the series was dubbed, under English title, on VOX as a weekly feature on a 4-to-6h slot called \"DCTP Nachtclub\" with several episodes in each slot, as part of the channel's \"Spiegel TV\" documentaries program co-operation with Der Spiegel. A Swiss-produced VHS set was released of the German-dubbed version under the title \"Chronik des 20. Jahrhunderts\". The German dub also ran on Austrian and Swiss television.\n\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, VHS box sets were produced in PAL and NTSC. By 2007, most original episodes remained unavailable on DVD, however in late 2006 DVD editions were released in the US of the two world-war episodes \"Killing Fields\" and \"Total War\" exclusively in NTSC, with a few cut-down post-war episodes (on a DVD called \"Young Blood\", drawing from the previously released \"Baby Boomers Boxed Set\" on VHS that had contained 5 complete episodes), by WGBH Boston.\n\n"}

The term became popular in English literature \"sometime before 1890\" and was first used in 1758.\n\nAlternate meanings describe \"Maharshi\" as a collective name that refers to the seven rishis or saptarishis (including Maharishi Bhrigu) cited in the scriptures of Rig Veda and the Puranas, or any of the several mythological seers that are referenced in Vedic writings and associated with the seven stars of the constellation Ursa Major.\n\nThe only ones who can adopt the title are those who achieve the highest state of awareness in the path of evolution and completely understand the working of parabramha.

{"id": "1821276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821276", "title": "Nina Williams", "text": "Nina Williams\n\nNina has an unstable and often violent relationship with her younger sister, Anna Williams, who is frequently her arch-rival in the series. She is known for her fast and lethal fighting style, based loosely on the fighting arts Hapkido and Koppojutsu, among others. \n\nNina was mostly very well received, often regarded as one of the best \"Tekken\" characters as well as one of the most attractive and stylish female characters in gaming. Nina is perhaps the most famous female fighter in the \"Tekken\" series.\n\nNina Williams was the daughter of an Irish father, former assassin Richard Williams, and an unnamed British mother in Ireland, as was her sister, Anna. From a young age, both Nina, and Anna, were taught various forms of martial arts such as assassination martial arts, hapkido and koppojutsu. Both sisters admired their father, which spawned a sibling rivalry between the two as they craved and competed for his attention. When Richard died, both sisters blamed each other as the cause of his death. Although they tried to maintain their relationship following their father's last wish, it only made their rivalry strengthen even further. Nina's training in the assassination martial arts helped her to quickly become an assassin for-hire. The 20-year-old Nina had later been hired during The King of Iron Fist Tournament to assassinate the head of Mishima Zaibatsu, Heihachi Mishima. However, she failed.\n\nTwo years later, Nina was contracted again to assassinate the current head of Mishima Zaibatsu, Kazuya Mishima, by entering The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2, but Anna intervened, and a conflict prevented her from fulfilling the assignment. Nina was captured by Kazuya after failing to assassinate him and was used as a test subject in the \"cold sleep\" project by Dr. Boskonovitch - a cryogenic experiment. Anna Williams volunteered to be put in cryogenic sleep, but demanded to be awoken at the same time as Nina. The experiment went on for 19 years.\n\nWhen Nina woke up from the cryosleep, she suffered heavy amnesia, a fate from which her sister Anna was spared. She was also controlled by the recently awakened Ogre, the God of Fighting who sent her to participate in The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3 to assassinate Jin Kazama, - Heihachi Mishima's grandson. Near the end of the tournament, Jin managed to beat Nina back to her senses, allowing her to break free from Ogre's control. As an act of compassion, Anna wanted to end Nina's job of an assassin, however wanted to continue their rivalry. So Anna worked intensively with Dr. Boskonovitch to bring her sister's memories back. However, the project failed when Nina recovered the memory about the fact that she and her sister did not get along. After this, Nina left and did not contact Anna for some time.\n\nNina soon revived her role as an assassin, the only other memory that she recalled from her previous life. Two years later, she was contracted by a Mafia syndicate to kill a famous British boxer, Steve Fox. However, she discovered that Steve was in fact her biological son, who was born through In vitro fertilisation during her years in cryosleep. With her genes, Doctor Abel conducted a Hybrid Gene experiment creating children, including Steve, until the experiment was cancelled after most of children died during that experiment, except for Steve and one of the surviving children, whose statuses were covered by the former Zaibatsu, now G Corporation researcher, Emma Kliesen, (Leo's mother) from being watched by the Zaibatsu's eyes. At the last moment when she tried to pull the trigger to her rifle, she somehow and rarely regained her human emotions, and refused to kill Fox. Nina abandoned her assassination attempt after detective Lei Wulong brought down the syndicate. After the collapse of her employers, Nina no longer possessed a viable reason to pursue her target. It was also revealed that she remained emotionally impassive about the discovery of her biological son, but the fact that she did not kill him when the chance presented itself shows otherwise for some.\n\nNina decided that it was time that she re-discovered her lost memories and came to the conclusion that the only person who could help her was her sister, Anna Williams. Anna met with Nina soon after. However, Nina's memories and hatred instinctively returned, and they rapidly engaged in a brawling duel. The duel lasted for days in a stalemate and the two later agreed to meet at The King of Iron Fist Tournament 5 to finish their battle. The two promised that only one would walk away from the coming battle, however, after Nina's victory, she refused to take Anna's life as their fight was not satisfactory.\n\nLater, Nina was approached by the Mishima Zaibatsu's new CEO, Jin Kazama, who had already launched war around the world, to be his personal bodyguard. Nina accepted and entered The King of Iron Fist Tournament 6 to intercept any possible threat to him. Meanwhile, Anna, vowed to take revenge on Nina and became Kazuya Mishima's personal bodyguard, with the belief that she was bound to come face to face with Nina along the way. In the Scenario Campaign mode of the console version of \"Tekken 6\", Nina served as one of the antagonists, assisting Jin at his scheme. After Jin sacrificed himself to kill Azazel at the end, Nina told Lars that she already knew of Jin's plans about the world war since the beginning: so he can awaken Azazel's physical body, but she was unsure of whether Jin's actions were right or wrong. Nina then left with a Mishima Zaibatsu helicopter, which may or may not signify that she became Mishima Zaibatsu's temporary new CEO during Jin's disappearance.\n\nNina did not appear in \"Tekken 7\"'s original arcade release, but Nina returned in its updated title, \"Tekken 7: Fated Retribution\". In the story mode, she was forced to work for the returning Heihachi in the first-half, until she began to have concerns about Lars' good reason to keep Jin safe with him, and deemed it very interesting to watch. She resigned from the Zaibatsu, faked her death, then set her private assassination job for hire. She was later tasked with infiltrating a mafia wedding which happened to be held by G Corpotation, and posed as the bride, while the real bride of the mafia happened to be her sister Anna, whom Nina stole the wedding dress from. Although she succeeded in murdering Anna's groom, Nina was somehow pursued by her son Steve, and the Tekken Force as well Anna and the fellow G Corporation mafia themselves. However, encountering Steve will give her a best opportunity to escape. Eventually in Steve's ending, continued from his \"Tag 2\" ending finally revealed that when she was put to cryosleep between \"Tekken\" \"2\" and \"3\", Mishima Zaibatsu attempted to use her genes to create child super soldiers that could fit the Devil Gene project for the organization army. Steve is one of the survivors thanks to the cover by the now late-Doctor Emma Kliesen.\n\nNina stars in her own action game, \"Death by Degrees\", released in 2005. The game provides an alternate backstory for Nina and Anna; the plot concentrating more on their father and how he died when they were children. In this game it is revealed that Richard Williams had struggled with a few guardsmen, and shouted for Nina to grab a gun which one of guardsmen had dropped. However, her hesitation and fear caused the guards to get the upper hand and shoot Richard Williams, killing him. Anna is shown comforting her sister moments after, while the older Nina looks over the scene. The rivalry which stemmed from the incident crossed over to the real-time events of the \"Tekken\" series.\n\nNina also appears in the crossover fighting game \"Street Fighter X Tekken\" with her official tag partner, Kazuya. In the cinematic trailer, they battle against Ryu and Ken at a condemned building, before Kazuya captures Ryu as bait to lure Jin out.\n\nAccording to Namco's \"Tekken\" original design team, \"it was Nina or Kazuya who was the soul, the cool part, of the [first] game.\" Producer Yozo Sakagami said about their choice of Roberto Ferrari as her character designer, \"Nina is a white character, and as you can see with games like \"Final Fantasy\", when Japanese artists try to design white women or whatever, [the characters] kind of turn Japanese in their facial features and just the way they look, generally. And we didn't want that with Nina.\"\n\nNina has a blonde ponytail, blue eyes, and a slim hourglass figure, yet a powerful build. Her look contrasts that of her sister, Anna, who is a brunette. She dresses primarily in purple fitted costumes and is commonly seen wearing a military style outfit (to suit her occupation), sometimes also in costumes made of materials resembling spandex, PVC and leather; she was barefoot in the first game but most often, she wears stiletto heels (a nod to her assassin motif). In \"Tekken 6\", one of Nina's extra outfits is one of her \"Death by Degrees\" costumes. Her default costume in \"Tekken 7\" is Anna's stolen wedding gown: off-white, burned and tattered, long strapless wedding gown and veil, white gloves and stockings, and white stilettos.\n\nNina is known for her lethal grappling techniques and counterattacks. She also has a versatile repertoire of striking attacks with all limbs; Anna shares many moves with her. Nina was also among the first characters to utilize chain throws, having them since \"Tekken 2\" where she was recommended for aggressive players. \"In Tekken Tag Tournament\", she was noted as \"feared by many players\" due to her many combos that are difficult to counter, but her command list has a high execution barrier; she is a challenge, requiring a lot of practice to master. In \"Tekken 6\", she has strong jabbing abilities, is agile and has above average strength.\n\nNina also appears in the OVA \"\" as one of the main antagonists. She is seduced by Lee Chaolan and he hires her to kill Kazuya Mishima so that he will inherit the Mishima Zaibatsu from Heihachi. Nina attempts many times to assassinate Kazuya, but he keeps foiling her with his superior skills. Her rivalry with Anna is also present, although it differs from the games in the sense that Nina was favored by their father, who Anna killed out of resentment. Eventually, Nina fights Anna somewhere on the island where the tournament is being held. As Anna is ambushed and devoured by a biologically enhanced dinosaur-like being (similar in appearance to Alex), Nina flees. She is last seen among the other fighters who made it off the island before it explodes, but with Lee's death and Heihachi fleeing, she abandons her contract against Kazuya.\n\nNina Williams was portrayed by South African model and singer Candîce Hillebrand in the 2009 film adaptation, \"Tekken\". In the film, she is a participant in the Iron Fist tournament, yet serves as an assassin under Kazuya along with Anna. Both of them are also Kazuya's lovers. Kazuya sends Nina and Anna to assassinate Jin Kazama, but the ensuing fight attracts Christie Monteiro's attention and Nina and Anna flee. In the next round, Jin recognizes Nina as one of the assassins, and Christie takes her revenge on Nina by beating her soundly in the ring. She returns when Kazuya order his soldiers to arrest the fighters. Nina is seen in one of the cells with Anna and Dragunov. Unlike the games, she and Anna are on good terms and has no relation to Steve Fox.\n\nNina also appears in the animated film \"\". In its beginning, she rides a motorcycle while fighting Anna. Despite being cornered, she still manages to escape and is sent to Russia by Jin to find Alisa Bosconovitch. She once again appears after Xiaoyu and Alisa escape from Anna. Anna attempts to capture Nina, amusing Lee.\n\nSummer Daniels portrayed Nina in the \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\" live-action trailer \"Girl Power\" in 2012. In 1998, Epoch Co. released a 1/10 scale Nina action figure based on her appearance in \"Tekken 3\", including two plastic swords and one plastic gun. An action figure based on her appearance from \"Tekken 5\" was released in 2006; two figures based on her appearance in \"Death by Degrees\" were also released that same year. Kotabukiya released a bishoujo figure of Nina from \"Tag Tournament 2\" designed by Shunya Yamashita for the 20th anniversary of \"Tekken\" in 2014.\n\nThe character was received mostly very positively. Gaming Target listed the \"world's sexiest assassin\" Nina Williams as the fifth best \"Tekken\" character in 2006. \"Complex\" ranked this \"ultimate ice queen\" as the second best \"Tekken\" character in 2013 for her \"huge arsenal of pokes at her disposal, not to mention chain throws and combo launchers.\" In an official poll by Namco, Nina ranked as the 14th most requested \"Tekken\" character to be playable in \"Tekken X Street Fighter\".\n\nNina Williams was chosen as one of the 20 \"muses\" of video games by Brazilian magazine \"SuperGamePower\" in 2001 and as the number one Namco muse by \"Dicas & Truques para PlayStation\" in 2004. In 2007, Tom's Games listed Nina among the 50 greatest female characters in video game history, commenting that \"she has without a doubt one of the best bodies in the business\". In QMI Agency's 2012 poll \"ultimate fighting champion\", Nina beat \"Dead or Alive\"'s Kasumi and \"Virtua Fighter\"'s Pai Chan, before losing to \"Mortal Kombat\"'s Liu Kang. In 2014, What Culture ranked Nina as the 12th greatest ever fighting game character, opining she \"isn’t overtly sexualised in the same way that, say, Taki and Ivy from \"SoulCalibur\" are,\" and regarding her as among the strongest female video game characters.\n\nNina was often noted for sex appeal. Readers of German magazine \"Mega Fun\" and of Polish edition of \"GameStar\" had her voted at third place for the \"Video Game Babe of 1998\" award and fifth in the 2006 poll for the title of \"Miss of the Video Game World\", respectively. She was voted the \"Hottest Female Fighting Character\" in a 2008 poll by \"Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition\", also previously being voted number one in the \"Hot\" category by readers of French magazine \"Consoles +\" in 2004. \n\nShe has been placed on many lists of most attractive female game characters, including being placed sixth by GameTrailers in 2007, 30th by GameDaily in 2008, 17th by UGO in 2011, 20th by Gadget Review in 2012, and 15th by GameHall's Portal PlayGame in 2014. \"Maxim\" listed Nina among the top nine \"video game vixens\" in 2009, complimenting her costumes and her running around with a katana with very high heels in \"Death by Degrees\" as \"frightening and erotic at the same time,\" and she was also showcased on a similar list by Polish magazine \"Fakt\" in 2013. MSN included her among the 20 \"hottest women in video game history\" in 2012, adding that \"she became hotter and hotter as graphics technology improved,\" while Interia.pl included Nina among the \"sexiest game heroines\" of that year. \n\n\"PLAY\" ranked her as second top \"hottest\" blonde in games in 2010, adding that she \"was sexy even back when her hair was made out of about eight polygons,\" while Gadżetomania.pl ranked her as number one top \"sexiest and fierce\" blonde in games. In addition, she was included in GameDaily's top list of hottest blondes in video games, for having both \"a killer body\" and a killer instinct. Lisa Foiles of \"The Escapist\" put her among the top five \"hottest blonde chicks\" in 2011, stating her preference of Nina over many other fighting game blondes (such as Cammy, Jill Valentine, Sarah Bryant, Sophitia and Tina Armstrong), as well as her sister Anna, and noting Nina's resemblance to Capcom's Jill Valentine in \"Resident Evil 5\".\n\nG4 included Nina among her the best assassins in all video games in 2004. In 2011, Joystick Division ranked Nina as the second most \"badass\" Irish character in video games and \"PlayStation Official Magazine\" listed her among \"PlayStation’s meanest mothers\". \"FHM\" listed a fight between Nina and Poison as one of the ten \"awesome fantasy fights\" in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", as \"hot girls fighting is always a spectacle to see, and these two represent the sauciest for both franchises.\"\n\nHowever, the \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" called the \"Death by Degrees\" Nina as an \"overrated\" spin-off character in comparison to \"Whiplash\" protagonist Spanx. GameDaily listed Nina's appearance in \"Death by Degrees\" as one of her worst moments, citing the game's poor gameplay and below-average graphics.\n\n\n"}

The hardships of life at sea damaged his health permanently, but provided him with material for a career as a writer. He wrote short stories, press articles, historical essays, biographies and a book of verse, but was known best for his novels, most of which were about life at sea. He maintained a simultaneous career as a journalist, principally as a columnist on nautical subjects for \"The Daily Telegraph\".\n\nRussell campaigned for better conditions for merchant seamen, and his work influenced reforms approved by Parliament to prevent unscrupulous ship-owners from exploiting their crews. His influence in this respect was acknowledged by the future King George V. Among Russell's contemporary admirers were Herman Melville, Algernon Swinburne and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\nWilliam Clark Russell was born in New York in the Carlton House Hotel, Broadway, one of four sons of the English composer Henry Russell and his first wife, Isabella Lloyd (1811?–1887).\n\nIt was from Isabella, \"who was a relative of the poet William Wordsworth\" and writer herself, that Russell inherited his love for literature and talent as a wordsmith. Additionally, he was the half-brother of the impresario Henry Russell and the conductor Sir Landon Ronald.\n\nA letter in the collection of Robert Lee Wolff provides a scalding vindication of Russell's father, stemming from his father's abandonment of his family.If you know who my father is, I shall feel obliged by your not saying so. Enough if I hint at the degradation of a second marriage, at the imposition of a ready-made family of active and talkative youth to explain why I wish that you will be absolutely silent on the subject of my paternal parentageWilliam Russell was never able to forgive his father for his second marriage and his abandonment of his initial family to raise a new one with his second wife. Russell continued this long held resentment against his father and his new family until his father's death in 1900. Not only did he avoid attending the funeral, but he also never acknowledged his half brothers.\n\nHe was educated at private schools in Britain (Winchester) and France (Boulogne). At the latter, together with a school friend, a son of Charles Dickens, he planned to quit school to travel in Africa. A letter from Dickens dissuaded the boys, but Russell continued to crave a life of adventure.\n\nAt the age of 13, Russell left school and joined the United Kingdom's Merchant Navy as an apprentice on the Duncan Dunbar. In 1894 he recollected:\n\nRussell travelled to Asia and Australia. Off the coast of China during 1860 he witnessed the capture of the Taku Forts by combined British and French forces. Later, while he was serving on the ship Hougomont, the third mate went mad, and attacked him with a table-knife. Russell began to write of some of his experiences when he was confined to his quarters for a breach of discipline.\n\nAt the age of 21, in 1866, Russell quit the Merchant Service. As the privations of his eight years as a sailor had gravely damaged his health, he was never completely healthy again for the rest of his life. The positive legacy from his service was a wealth of material on which he based a successful career as a novelist.\n\nAt the age of 24, Russell married Anna Maria Alexandrina Clark Russell \"née\" Henry (January 1845September 11, 1926), whom he referred to as Alexandrina. The two married on June 27, 1868 in St. Stephen, Paddington, Westminster, England.\n\nIn just one year, William and Alexandrina welcomed their first son, Herbert Henry William (March 28, 1896March 23, 1944), on March 28, 1869. In total the couple had six children, two sons and 4 daughters, during their years together. In April 1870, Eveleen Katherina (April 1870January 1879) was born, but her life was cut short in January 1879 at the young age of 9. Following the loss of their first born daughter, the couple had Geraldine Mary Clark (April 1872Mary 15, 1949) in April 1872. Then came Charles Edward (June 9, 1875October 19, 1906), born June 9, 1875; Marguerite Isabelle Ellaby (April 1877May 1, 1961) born April 1877; and finally Annie Marcella (October 1880May 19, 1966), born October 1880.\n\nWilliam Russell's first-born, Herbert, followed closely in his father's footsteps. Having caught his father's love for the sea and literature, Herbert followed a similar path to William's, also becoming a journalist for the very same newspapers, \"The Newcastle Daily Chronicle\" and \"The Daily Telegraph.\" Subsequently, Herbert wrote his own nautical novels and accompanied the Prince of Wales on his tour of India and Japan (1921–1922).\n\nThe Magazine, \"The War Illustrated\", mentions both William Clarke Russell and Herbert Henry William Russell in their publication on June 7, 1917.Lastly, but not least, for he is the biggest man of all the correspondents at G.H.Q., France, comes Mr. Herbert Russell, the representative of Reuter's and the Press Association. Big, bluff, and hearty, he is known among his colleagues as \"The Genial Russell.\" He has the sailor rather than the soldier manner, which is fitting, perhaps, for he is the son of Clark Russell, the sailor and famous writer of sailor stories.\n\nIt is to the sea and sailors and especially to the Navy that Russell has devoted his enthusiasm as a journalist. But his dispatches of late, with their quick, common-sense surveys of what is happening at the war, have shown that he is as \"handy\" a correspondent on land as on sea ? and they say that Russell can give you from memory the size, armament, and equipment of any ship in the British Navy with details of its personnel, which, as the Yankees would say it 'going some'.\n\nRussell had an office job with a commercial company for a few months, after which he decided to attempt a literary career. His first attempt was a five-act tragedy, \"Fra Angelico\", which was staged unsuccessfully in London during 1866. At the same time, he began work as a journalist in order to provide a stable income for himself and his family. In 1868, he began his journalism career and was the editor for \"The Leader\" for a brief period of time until 1871 when he joined the \"Kent County News\". and during the next two decades wrote for a variety of newspapers including \"The Newcastle Daily Chronicle\", \"The Kent County News\", and most importantly for him, \"The Daily Telegraph\", for which he wrote articles for about seven years using the pseudonym \"Seafarer\".\n\nAt his time with the \"Daily Telegraph\" he planted the seeds of what would be his legacy, his masterful prose of the sea. Among his works with the \"Daily Telegraph\" are the \"Indian Chief\" (5 January 1881), and many of his articles were reprinted in volumes to create \"My Watch Below\" (1882) and \"Round the Galley Fire\" (1883).\n\nThere is much confusion around Russell's career, possibly a result of his writings being published anonymously or under various pseudonyms, so much so that even his immediate family were unaware of the full extent of his writings. From the early 1870s, Russell published novels using various pseudonyms (Sydney Mostyn, Eliza Rhyl Davies, and Philip Sheldon) with modest success. The adoption of the more feminine pseudonyms, according to Andrew Nash, \"arose from his perception of the novel as a feminized form and novel-reading as predominantly a female activity.\" Adopting many feminine pseudonyms in his early works was a result of the Victorian era belief that certain genres were destined only for certain genders. His early attempts at novels set on land only proved to be a failure, obscured by the nautical novels that had established him as a master of the niche during his time. In conjunction, his poetic and artistic prose and description of the sea facilitated his literary success.\n\nThe stories of an old seaman at Ramsgate gave him the idea of writing about life at sea, drawing on his own experience. An obituarist of Russell wrote that since the heyday of such writers as Captain Marryat, Michael Scott and Frederick Chamier some thirty or forty years before, \"no one in this country had written of the sea from actual knowledge\". As Richard D. Graham notes in \"Masters of Victorian Literature, 1837-1897,\" \"Of living authors, William Clark Russell (1844) is the true successor of Marryat, and may even be said to excel the older writer in the power with which he has described the cruel mystery of the sea, its dangers, and the crimes and superstitions of the men who do business upon it\".\nRussell was at first doubtful if stories of merchant navy life could compete with tales of the Royal Navy: \"Only two writers had dealt with the mercantile side of the ocean life – Dana, the author of \"Two Years before the Mast\" and Herman Melville, both of them, it is needless to say, Americans. I could not recollect [such] a book written by an Englishman.\" His first attempt at a novel of merchant navy life was John Holdsworth, Chief Mate during 1875, which Russell later thought of as \"reluctant and timid in dealing with sea topics\". It received kindly reviews, but Russell regarded his next attempt, \"The Wreck of the Grosvenor\" (1877), as his first real sea book.\n\nRussell sold the copyright of \"The Wreck of the Grosvenor\" to the publisher Sampson Low for £50 (about £21,000 in 2011 terms). During the next four years it sold nearly 35,000 copies. Excellent reviews and good sales helped establish Russell's writing pattern. The scholar John Sutherland wrote during 1989 that \"The Wreck of the Grosvenor\" was \"the most popular mid-Victorian melodrama of adventure and heroism at sea.\" It remained popular and widely read in illustrated editions well into the first half of the 20th century. It was Russell's best-selling and best-known novel, though at the time of its first appearance in 1877, it published anonymously. Russell noted in a preface, the novel \"found its first and best welcome in the United States,\" and commented elsewhere that his work was greeted with more enthusiasm in the United States than in Britain.\n\nThe biographer G S Woods lists among Russell's best sea novels \"The Frozen Pirate\" (1877), \"A Sailor's Sweetheart\" (1880), \"An Ocean Tragedy\" (1881), \"The Death Ship\" (1888), \"List, ye Landsmen\" (1894) and \"Overdue\" (1903). According to Woods, Russell wrote a total of 57 novels. Additionally, he published collections of short stories and newspaper articles; a volume of historical essays; popular biographies (William Dampier and Admirals Nelson and Collingwood); and a collection of verses.\n\nAmong authors, Russell is widely admired and revered. Algernon Swinburne described Russell as \"the greatest master of the sea, living or dead.\" Herman Melville admired Russell's work, and dedicated his book \"John Marr and Other Sailors\" (1888) to him. Russell reciprocated, dedicating \"An Ocean Tragedy\" to Melville during 1890. Despite their mutual regard, neither writer influenced the other's style, and it is Melville's works that have proved the more enduring. Arthur Conan Doyle made Dr. John Watson an admirer in The Five Orange Pips in which he was \"deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea stories\" while temporarily back in 221B Baker Street.\n\nParticularly during later years, when arthritis made it difficult for him to hold a pen, Russell dictated his work to a secretary. According to \"The Manchester Guardian\", \"like most dictated work, these books have a rather inflated, rhetorical, literary manner.\" Despite this criticism, the paper concluded:\nAccording to Woods, \"His descriptions of storms at sea and atmospheric effects were brilliant pieces of word painting, but his characterization was often indifferent, and his plots were apt to become monotonous.\" Among the praise Russell received from his colleagues, he is also far revered by his contemporaries such as Sir Edwin Arnold who said, \"he was the prose Homer of the great ocean\".\n\nWoods writes that Russell's sea novels \"stimulated public interest in the conditions under which sailors lived, and thereby paved the way for the reform of many abuses.\" The year after Russell's death, Woods wrote:\nLater, Russell turned his attention to the deplorable provisions that unscrupulous ship-owners provided for merchant seamen on their vessels: \"Nothing more atrociously nasty could be found amongst the neglected putrid sweepings of a butcher's back premises\".\n\nBut, his efforts did not stop there. Russell extended his sympathy even to the captive natives of the time of British colonization of Tasmania. He described in great detail the merciless treatment the British forces used against native captives. One such description so horrifically described was the story of Lalla Rookh of Tasmania, a Tasmanian girl who had watched her mother get butchered by the British settlers, her sisters raped and captured, and the men of her family shot dead in front of her. The horrors for Lalla only continued as she was taken on a convict ship sailing to Australia, all of which Russell was a witness. \"The Owl,\" a Birmingham newspaper, wrote the following:The poor wretches were treated like beasts and flogged unmercifully, and their fearful experiences on an outward bound convict ship, so vividly painted by William Clark Russell, were but foretastes of the horrors awaiting them in the penal colonies of Australia.Though this did little to halt the brutish treatment by the British colonizers, Russell's empathy towards those captive people helped to record and reveal the atrocity committed by the British people.\n\nDuring his last two decades Russell became progressively more disabled by arthritis, generally regarded as a legacy of his years at sea as a youth – \"the sailor's enemy\", as \"The Manchester Guardian\" stated. He did not allow this to stop him writing; \"The Times\" commented, \"He worked harder than many haler men.\" He went to health resorts including Bath, Droitwich and Madeira, and after living in Ramsgate and Deal on the south coast of England, he settled in Bath. He was bed-ridden for the last six months of his life.\n\nRussell died at his home in Bath at the age of 67, and his remains are buried in Smallcombe Cemetery in Bath.\n\n\n\n"}

For 40 years Creech was the chief publisher in Edinburgh. He published the first Edinburgh edition of Robert Burns' poems, and Sir John Sinclair's influential \"Statistical Accounts of Scotland\". In publishing Creech often went under the pseudonym of Theophrastus.\n\nWilliam was the son of Rev William Creech, a minister in Newbattle, Midlothian and his wife, Mary Buley. His father died when he was four months old and William spent time with his mother in both Perth and Dalkeith. He was educated at Dalkeith Grammar School then studied Medicine at Edinburgh University.\n\nFor two years (1766 to 1768) he travelled with William Strahan and Thomas Cadell to London and the continent, both France and Holland. After some time back in Edinburgh he went on a Grand Tour with Lord Kilmaurs in 1770, visiting France, Germany, Switzerland and Holland.\n\nHis mother struck up a friendship with Alexander Kincaid and thereafter he trained as an apprentice printer in the firm of Kincaid & Bell. In 1771 he went into partnership with his former master (and erstwhile stepfather), Alexander Kincaid. Kincaid was a publisher (and later Lord Provost of Edinburgh) who had purchased Allan Ramsay's bookshop in the Luckenbooths next to St. Giles Cathedral. In 1773 Kincaid gave Creech the bookshop to concentrate on the printing side of his work. The building soon thereafter became known as \"Creech's Land\", Creech staying here for 44 years. Burn's poems were published from this building.\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1784 (in the first intake of members following its foundation in 1783). His proposers were Andrew Dalzell, James Gregory and Alexander Fraser Tytler. In 1786 he was a founder member of the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce.\n\nIn 1786, John 15th Lord Glencairn introduced Creech to Robert Burns an important alliance was created, leading to Creech printing and selling the famous \"Edinburgh Edition\"s of Burns' poems in 1787, 1793 and 1794. Creech is one of the very small and elite group to have had two poems written about him by Robert Burns: \"Lament for the Absence of William Creech\" (usually called \"Willie's Awa'\"), marking Creech's absence from Edinburgh to visit London: and \"On William Creech\", a short, sharp poem following an argument.\n\nIn 1788 he was a member of the jury in Deacon William Brodie's trial for robbery. Within days, his account of the trial and execution was for sale in his High Street bookshop.\n\nServing as a Councillor from 1780 and Bailie from 1807, he served as Edinburgh's Lord Provost from 1811 to 1813.\n\nCreech never married and had no children. He is buried at Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh in the western extension, midway along the western path. \n\nA plaque to his, and his father's, memory can be seen at Newbattle Kirk.\n\nHe lived at Craigs Close on the Royal Mile until around 1800 then moved to 5 George Street in the new Town for his final years.\n\nCreech's land (his shop) was demolished in 1817 to allow vehicles to pass on the north side of St Giles Cathedral.\n\nCreech occasionally wrote the books which he published. The most notable are:\n\n\nDue to Creech's position and standing he held a unique and pivotal role within the Scottish Enlightenment and had both business relationships and friendships with many of the Edinburgh literati.\n\nHis most notable relationships include: Robert Burns, Lord Kames, Hugh Blair, James Beattie and Dugald Stewart.\n\n"}

In the Early Middle Ages, there were, in each province, a number of feudal lords who often were just as powerful, and sometimes more so, than the rulers themselves. In old times, no title other than \"knight\" existed.\n\nIn the middle of the fourteenth century, quarrels between the feudal lords reduced many families and castles to ruins, contributing to the Dukes of Burgundys' acquisition by conquest or inheritance of many of the provinces forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n\nIn 1581, representatives of the Seven Provinces abjured Philip II of Spain, heir of the Dukes of Burgundy. This left a great part of the executive and legislative power to the Ridderschap (\"knight\") of each province, which consisted of the representatives of those families of the old feudal nobility.\n\nIn 1795, the Batavian Revolution did away with their power, and it was not before 1813, when William I became King of the Netherlands, that they were again given power in another form. Still, by the time of the constitution of 1848, they had no influence in government affairs.\n\nIn 1813, if no higher title was recognised, the men only were to bear the hereditary predicate of \"Jonkheer\". Some old feudal families obtained the title of \"Baron\" or \"Baroness\" for all their descendants.\n\nOlder nobility, having been granted their titles by either the Holy Roman Emperors or French Kings long before 1813, held their pre-existent titles, which were confirmed in the new Kingdom of the Netherlands (such as the families Bentinck, Limburg Stirum and Van Rechteren). In some of these families it is more usual that only the oldest male descendant bears the family title while other descendants bear the predicate of \"Jonkheer\" (m) or \"Jonkvrouw\" (f).\n\n\n\"The title Duke/Duchess (Hertog in Dutch) is no longer in existence in noble families of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in this day and age.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Jonkheer/Jonkvrouw\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Ten years after its dissolution it was revived and now continues as Cashbox Magazine (with \"Cashbox\" a single word), an online magazine with weekly charts and occasional special print issues.\n\n\"Cashbox\" is one of several magazines that publish record charts in the United States. Its most prominent competitors are \"Billboard\" and \"Record World\" (known as \"Music Vendor\" prior to April 1964). Unlike \"Billboard\", \"Cashbox\" combines all currently available recordings of a song into one chart position with artist and label information shown for each version, alphabetized by label. Originally, no indication of which version was the biggest seller was given, but from October 25, 1952, a star was placed next to the names of the most important artists. \"Cash Box\" also printed shorter jukebox charts that included specific artist data beginning in Spring 1950. Separate charts were presented for jukebox popularity, record sales and radio airplay. This was similar to \"Billboard\"s methodology prior to August 1958, when \"Billboard\" debuted its \"Hot 100\", which attempted to combine all measures of popularity into one all-encompassing chart.

The organisation aims to \"contribute to progressive political thinking\" as well as \"progressive political culture\".\n\nThe Australian Fabians have historically had close ties with the Australian Labor Party (ALP). This is evidenced by the number of past ALP prime ministers, federal ministers and state premiers who were active members of the Australian Fabians while in office. The role of patron of the Australian Fabians is filled by media and Social Commentator and progressive thinker, Eva Cox, but was previously filled by former Australian prime minister, the late Gough Whitlam. This is a temporary arrangement and the position will be filled when an appropriate person to fund and uphold the society's values is found.\n\nThe Australian Fabians have had a significant influence on public policy development in Australia since the Second World War, with many of its members having held influential political offices in Australian governments.\n\nAn earlier experiment with Fabianism in Australia was initiated in Adelaide in 1891 by the Rev Charles Marson, who had joined the Fabians in London in 1885 and drew in trade unionists like David Charleston, Robert Guthrie and John McPherson as well as social reformers like James & Lucy Morice into the first overseas branch of the UK Fabian Society. The Australian members retained their membership for ten years until the Adelaide branch was wound up in 1902.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Victorian branch was closely aligned with the Participants grouping within the Victorian Labor Party, \"who became the centre of organised support for Whitlam and opposition to the hard-left dominated Victorian Central Executive\". The Victorian Labor Party at the time was run by the historic left grouping, while Whitlam and other states were involved with the historic right grouping.\n\nThe Australian Fabians' Statement of Purpose states:\n\"Australian Fabians promote the common good and foster the advance of social democracy in Australia through reasoned debate by:\"\n\"a) Contributing to progressive political thinking by generating ideas that reflect a level of thinking that meets the challenges of the times.\"\n\"b) Contributing to a progressive political culture by disseminating these ideas and getting them into the public domain.\"\n\"c) Creating an active movement of people who identify with, are engaged in and who encourage progressive political debate and reform, and\"\n\"d) Influencing the ideas and policies of political parties, especially the Australian Labor Party.\"\nPrime Ministers\n\nPremiers\n\nPoliticians\n\nOther members\n"}

Dyce was associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and played a part in their early popularity.\n\nDyce was born on the 19 September 1806 at 48 Marischal Street in Aberdeen, the son of Dr William Dyce of Fonthill and Cuttlehill FRSE (1770–1835) and Margaret Chalmers of Westburn (1776–1856). His uncle was General Alexander Dyce FRSE (d.1834). His older brother was Prof Robert Dyce FRSE.\n\nDyce began his career at the Royal Academy schools, and then travelled to Rome for the first time in 1825. While he was there, he studied the works of Titian and Poussin. He returned to Rome in 1827, this time staying for a year and a half, and during this period he appears to have made the acquaintance of the German Nazarene painter Friedrich Overbeck. After these travels, he settled for several years in Edinburgh. He supported himself by painting portraits at first, but soon took to other subjects of art, especially the religious subjects he preferred.\n\nDyce was given charge of the School of Design in Edinburgh, and was then invited to London, where he was based thereafter, to head the newly established Government School of Design, later to become the Royal College of Art. Before taking up this post in 1838 he and a colleague were sent to visit France and Germany to enquire into design education there and prepare a report. He left the school in 1843, to be able to paint more, but remained a member of the Council of the school. The ideas that were turned in the following decade into the \"South Kensington system\" that dominated English art education for the rest of the century really have their origin in Dyce's work.\n\nDyce is less known for, but nevertheless important as, the founder of the Motett Society (1840–1852), which sought to advance the restoration and liturgical use of long-neglected works of the English church. He was noted as an able organist, and is also reputed to have composed some musical works (unverified).\n\nDyce died in Streatham in Surrey on 14 February 1864. He is buried in the churchyard of St Leonards Church in Streatham. He is also memorialised on his parent's grave in St Nicholas Churchyard on Union Street in Aberdeen, and there is a street in Streatham named for him – William Dyce Mews. A stained glass window in St Machar's Cathedral is jointly dedicated to Dyce.\n\nDyce's most highly thought of painting today is his exceptionally detailed seaside landscape of Pegwell Bay in Kent, now in the Tate Gallery. A rather atypical work, it is fully titled \"Pegwell Bay, Kent – a Recollection of October 5th 1858\", and was exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1860.\n\nThe largest collection of Dyce's work is held at Aberdeen Art Gallery, Scotland.\n\nDyce is the figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites. He befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to the influential art critic John Ruskin. His later work was Pre-Raphaelite in its spirituality, as can be seen in his \"The Man of Sorrows\" and \"David in the Wilderness\" (both 1860), which contain a Pre-Raphaelite attention to detail.\n\nLater in his career, Dyce turned to fresco-painting, and was selected to execute a series of murals at the newly completed the Palace of Westminster. In preparation for work at Westminster, he returned to Italy in 1845–47, to observe the fresco techniques employed there. He was particularly impressed by Pinturicchio's frescoes in the Piccolomini Library in Siena, and by the works of Perugino.\n\nDyce was commissioned to decorate the Queen's Robing Room in the Palace. He chose as his subject the Arthurian legends, He had some difficulty adapting the Courtly love of Malory's tales to Victorian mores. The Arthurian legend became popular later in the Victorian period, but when Dyce received the commission to decorate the room in 1847, it was still an obscure subject. The legend soon became a major problem for Dyce, as it turns on the unfaithfulness of a queen, which causes the fall of a kingdom.\n\nAfter initially experimenting with a narrative sequence in which the tale would unfold in the room's panels, Dyce abandoned this in favour of an allegorical approach. In their finished form, Dyce's frescoes depict scenes from the Arthurian legend that are intended to exemplify the virtues inscribed beneath them. The actions of the figures in his frescoes appear to the modern viewer to convey qualities whose status as virtues is uncertain, and the connection between the episodes from the Arthurian legend and the virtues they represent is sometimes difficult to discern. The virtues depicted are \"Mercy\", \"Hospitality\", \"Generosity\", \"Religion\", and \"Courtesy\". Two projected frescoes, \"Courage\" and \"Fidelity\", were never executed.\n\nDyce was working on the frescoes in Westminster when he collapsed, and later died at his home in Streatham on 14 February 1864. He was buried at St Leonard's Church, Streatham. A nearby drinking fountain, designed in the neo-Gothic style by Dyce, was subsequently dedicated to him by the parishioners.\n\nIn 1850 Dyce married Jane Bickerton Brand (d.1885).\n\nDyce's nephew (his sister's son) was the engineer William Dyce Cay, and his niece was Meredith Jemima Brown.\n\n"}

{"id": "1821304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821304", "title": "Joan Laporta", "text": "Joan Laporta\n\nJoan Laporta Estruch (; born 29 June 1962) is a Spanish politician and former president of FC Barcelona between 2003 and 2010.\n\nLaporta is a lawyer (he graduated from the University of Barcelona) with his own firm, Laporta & Arbós, which has important firms as clients. Laporta was married to Constanza Echevarría and has three sons, Pol, Guillem and Jan. He served as MP in the Parliament of Catalonia between 2010 and 2012.\n\nAlthough his career at Barcelona ended his recent years, he left the club having won six trophies in one year (2009) setting a new record.\n\nLaporta started his involvement with FC Barcelona leading the \"\"Elefant Blau\"\" (\"Blue Elephant\"), a group which opposed former president Josep Lluís Núñez and which, in 1998, tried unsuccessfully a vote of no confidence against him.\n\nIn the 2003 elections, Laporta did not start as the favourite, but his charisma grew during the electoral campaign and he finally won against the expected victor, publicist Lluís Bassat, in part because of a widely published (and ultimately unfulfilled) promise to bring David Beckham to Barcelona. Laporta had the support of other young businessmen of Barcelona, such as Sandro Rosell. Laporta quickly became a media star, even more than some of the players.\n\nLaporta's first season (2003–04) as president would prove to be a watershed for the club, but not without initial instability. The club situation was one of bitter unhappiness and disappointment amongst both fans and players after the club failed to meet their own standards to match Real Madrid's success in the early 2000s, having not won trophies since 1999.\n\nWith Laporta's arrival, and that of football superstar Ronaldinho (his solution signing after David Beckham's decision to turn down the club) as well as new manager Frank Rijkaard, among others, the club was forced to embark on a new phase, having elected a new, young and largely untested managerial board along with him. Laporta also decided to fight against the threat of violence outside the Camp Nou stadium, specially from the \"Boixos Nois\" (Mad Boys) ultras gang, and faced insults and death threats from them. Police investigation revealed they had planned to kidnap him. To exacerbate the situation, the 2003–04 season began abysmally results-wise, with Laporta constantly having to call for the fans' understanding and patience with him and Rijkaard as the club slowly phased out underachieving players from the old guard in order to rebuild a new-look side around Ronaldinho.\n\nLaporta also had to spur his board to foster creative business ideas to raise revenue, and in recent years, that new style of management eventually succeeded in turning around the fortunes of the club with the team spectacularly returning to form and finishing second after being at the bottom of the table in 2003–04, and then finally managing to win La Liga titles both in 2004–05 and in 2005–06. During this period, the inherited massive financial debt started to be cut down, and only two players remained from the original team that did not win a major title in six years, with players like Deco, Samuel Eto'o and Edmílson as the new starlets, around Ronaldinho and a core of home-grown players like Carles Puyol, Xavi, Víctor Valdés and Oleguer. The club finally won the UEFA Champions League on 17 May 2006, only their second time in history, as well as that year's Liga championship.\n\nBarcelona had a long history of avoiding shirt sponsors. In 2006, FC Barcelona announced a five-year agreement with UNICEF, where the club would donate €1.5 million and the UNICEF logo would feature on their shirts. After Laporta left as president, the club signed shirt sponsorships with Qatar Foundation and later Qatar Airways, which he criticised.\n\nNonetheless, Laporta's management of the sports sections of the club, especially the basketball section, has been controversial. On 2 June 2005, he faced the resignation of five members of the club's board of directors, including Sandro Rosell. They accused him of having changed for the worse as a person, having adopted authoritarian traits and harbouring ambitions of power.\n\nIn October 2005, he faced a scandal when his brother-in-law and member of the board of directors in charge of security, Alejandro Echevarría, was revealed to be a member of the Francisco Franco Foundation. After several denials by Echevarría and Laporta, contested by documents shown by a former member of the board of directors, Laporta was finally forced to accept Echevarría's resignation. Echevarría continued, however, to be close to the club and he organized the security during the celebrations of the 2005–06 La Liga championship.\n\nLaporta's own political history added to the complications surrounding the Echevarría scandal, as his politics are diametrically opposed to those implied by Echevarría's membership of the Francisco Franco Foundation. Laporta is a self-described Catalan nationalist and has been identified on several occasions as supporting the independence of Catalonia from Spain. In the early 1990s, he and fellow Catalan politicians Pilar Rahola and Ángel Colom founded the now-defunct Partit per la independencia, which supported Catalan separatism. He was also an active participant at the controversial Frankfurt Book Fair of 2007, at which Catalan language and culture were the special featured invitees, but not including other Catalonia-based authors who wrote in other languages, such as Spanish. At the fair, Laporta stated that he \"hopes that FC Barcelona continues to be a tool to promote the Catalan language and culture\" and to the contrary, he would feel obligated \"to create the Catalan Republic of Barcelona\".\n\nLaporta has been accused of mixing the club with his own political agenda.\n\nThere was some discussion about when exactly Laporta's mandate started, with the board of directors holding one opinion and the opposition another. One club member went to the court and, on 19 July 2006, a judge ruled that the first eight days of his presidency in June 2003 counted as the first year of his four-year term; his term had therefore expired and new elections were called. Temporarily, the club was ruled by a management committee led by the economist Xavier Sala-i-Martin.\n\nThe elections were to be held on 3 September 2006, but they turned out to be unnecessary: On 22 August, Barcelona confirmed Laporta's presidency for another four years after no other would-be candidate received the 1,804 signatures required to stand.\n\nThe poor results of the sports sections, especially in football, together with concerns about his leadership style, resulted in a censure motion which took place on 6 July 2008 and was led by Oriol Giralt. Exit polls showed that 60.60% of the 39,389 votes cast were against Laporta. Even though he lost the overall vote, however, the necessary 66% to hold new elections was not reached.\n\nFollowing the results, it was speculated that Laporta would resign due to pressure from fellow directors. This would have resulted in then vice-president Albert Vicens taking over for Laporta, with Ferran Soriano replacing Vicens as the main vice-president. These rumours, however, were quickly dismissed by Laporta. On 10 July 2008, 8 of the 17 board members – vice-presidents Albert Vicens, Ferran Soriano and Marc Ingla, and directors Evarist Murtra, Toni Rovira, Xavier Cambra, Clàudia Vives-Fierro and Josep Lluís Vilaseca – resigned following Laporta's confirmation that he will stay on as president of the club despite the opinion of the members. In a press statement, they revealed that they resigned due to \"discrepancies in the way to act after the result of the motion\".\n\nAfter dismissing Barcelona head coach Frank Rijkaard, Laporta appointed the untested and inexperienced Pep Guardiola, Barça's team captain at the end of the \"Dream Team\" era. Guardiola's only experience as a coach was with the B team the previous season (which won promotion from the fourth tier to the third). Although the team started poorly, losing the first match to Numancia and drawing the second, Barcelona had the best season in its history, winning the treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Champions League. Supercopa de España and UEFA Super Cup titles followed in August, as well as a FIFA Club World Cup victory in December.\n\nLaporta has long been involved in politics. In 1996, he joined the Independence Party, formed by Pilar Rahola and Àngel Colom, former members of the Republican Left of Catalonia.\n\nLaporta has long held ambitions to enter Spanish politics after leaving office as president of FC Barcelona. He has in the past been outspoken about his political affiliations: he supports Catalan independence from Spain. FC Barcelona is seen by many as a symbol of Catalonia, a generally accepted fact which Laporta often emphasizes but has been criticized by those who think that Barça should remain neutral from a political standpoint.\n\nFollowing the end of his second term as president, Laporta formed the independence-seeking political party \"Democràcia Catalana\" (Catalan Democracy). In the summer of 2010, Laporta's party merged with other extra-parliamentary pro-independence parties and grassroots movements into a political platform called Catalan Solidarity for Independence. Laporta was elected its president.\n\nIn the Catalan elections of 28 November 2010, the new party managed to win 4 seats in the 135-member Catalan Parliament, making it the sixth largest party out of seven. Laporta was elected in the circumscription of Barcelona.\n\nIn 2011, Laporta stepped down as president of the Catalan Solidarity for Independence and left the party.\n\nLaporta's son Pol is a footballer who plays as a midfielder.\n\n"}

It was presented to a special meeting of the American Historical Association at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois in 1893, and published later that year first in \"Proceedings of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin\", then in the \"Annual Report of the American Historical Association\". It has been subsequently reprinted and anthologized many times, and was incorporated into Turner's 1921 book, \"The Frontier in American History\", as Chapter I. \n\nThe thesis shares his views on how the idea of the frontier shaped the American being and characteristics. He writes how the frontier drove American history and why America is what it is today. Turner reflects on the past to illustrate his point by noting human fascination with the frontier and how expansion to the American West changed people's views on their culture. It is a thesis that has been respected in the historical circle for many years.\n\nIn 1942, in \"The Frontier and American Institutions: A Criticism of the Turner Thesis,\" Professor George Wilson Pierson debated the validity of the Turner thesis, stating that many factors influenced American culture besides the looming frontier. Although he respected Turner, Pierson strongly argues his point by looking beyond the frontier and acknowledging other factors in American development.\n\nThe Turner Thesis was also critiqued by Patricia Nelson Limerick in her 1987 book, \"The Legacy of Conquest: The Unbroken Past of the American West\". Limerick asserts the notion of a \"New Western History\" in which the American West is treated as a place and not a process of finite expansion. Limerick pushes for a continuation of study within the historical and social atmosphere of the American West, which she believes did not end in 1890, but rather continues on to this very day.\n\nUrban historian Richard C. Wade challenged the Frontier Thesis in his first asset, \"The Urban Frontier\" (1959), asserting that western cities such as Pittsburgh, Louisville, and Cincinnati, not the farmer pioneers, were the catalysts for western expansion.\n\nMore recently Glenda Riley has argued that Turner’s thesis ignored women. She argues that his context and upbringing led him to ignore the female portion of society, which directly led to the frontier becoming an exclusively male phenomenon. The exclusion of women is one of the central debates around his work, particularly referred to by New Western Historians.\n\n"}

{"id": "1821327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821327", "title": "Slide attack", "text": "Slide attack\n\nThe slide attack is a form of cryptanalysis designed to deal with the prevailing idea that even weak ciphers can become very strong by increasing the number of rounds, which can ward off a differential attack. The slide attack works in such a way as to make the number of rounds in a cipher irrelevant. Rather than looking at the data-randomizing aspects of the block cipher, the slide attack works by analyzing the key schedule and exploiting weaknesses in it to break the cipher. The most common one is the keys repeating in a cyclic manner.\n\nThe attack was first described by David Wagner and Alex Biryukov. Bruce Schneier first suggested the term \"slide attack\" to them, and they used it in their 1999 paper describing the attack.\n\nThe only requirements for a slide attack to work on a cipher is that it can be broken down into multiple rounds of an identical \"F\" function. This probably means that it has a cyclic key schedule. The \"F\" function must be vulnerable to a known-plaintext attack. The slide attack is closely related to the related-key attack.\n\nThe idea of the slide attack has roots in a paper published by Edna Grossman and Bryant Tuckerman in an IBM Technical Report in 1977. Grossman and Tuckerman demonstrated the attack on a weak block cipher named New Data Seal (NDS). The attack relied on the fact that the cipher has identical subkeys in each round, so the cipher had a cyclic key schedule with a cycle of only one key, which makes it an early version of the slide attack. A summary of the report, including a description of the NDS block cipher and the attack, is given in \"Cipher Systems\" (Beker & Piper, 1982).\n\nFirst, to introduce some notation. In this section assume the cipher takes \"n\" bit blocks and has a key-schedule using formula_1 as keys of any length.\n\nThe slide attack works by breaking the cipher up into identical permutation\nfunctions, \"F\". This \"F\" function may consist of more than one round\nof the cipher; it is defined by the key-schedule. For example, if a cipher uses an alternating key schedule where it switches between a formula_2 and formula_3 for each round, the \"F\" function would consist of two rounds. Each of the formula_4 will\nappear at least once in \"F\".\n\nThe next step is to collect formula_5 plaintext-ciphertext pairs. Depending on\nthe characteristics of the cipher fewer may suffice, but by the birthday problem no more than formula_5 should be needed. These pairs, which denoted as formula_7 are then used to find a slid pair which is denoted formula_8. A slid pair has the property that formula_9 and that formula_10. Once a slid pair is identified, the cipher is broken because of the vulnerability to known-plaintext attacks. The key can easily be extracted from this pairing.\nThe slid pair can be thought to be what happens to a message after one application of the function \"F\". It is ’slid’ over one encryption round and this is where the attack gets its\nname.\n\nThe process of finding a slid pair is somewhat different for each cipher\nbut follows the same basic scheme. One uses the fact that it is relatively\neasy to extract the key from just one iteration of \"F\". Choose any pair of\nplaintext-ciphertext pairs, formula_8 and check to see what the keys corresponding to formula_9 and formula_10 are. If these keys match, this is a slid pair; otherwise move on to the next pair.\n\nWith formula_5 plaintext-ciphertext pairs one slid pair is expected, along with a small number of false-positives depending on the structure of the cipher. The false positives\ncan be eliminated by using the keys on a different message-ciphertext pair to see if the encryption is correct. The probability that the wrong key will correctly encipher two or more messages is very low for a good cipher.\n\nSometimes the structure of the cipher greatly reduces the number of\nplaintext-ciphertext pairs needed, and thus also a large amount of the work.\nThe clearest of these examples is the Feistel cipher using a cyclic key schedule.\nThe reason for this is given a formula_15 the search is for a formula_16. This reduces the possible paired messages from formula_17\ndown to formula_5 (since half the message is fixed) and so at most formula_19 plaintext-ciphertext pairs are needed in order to find a slid pair.\n\n"}

It is one of the first candidate exoplanets to be directly observed (by infrared imaging). It was discovered in April 2004 by the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the Paranal Observatory in Chile by a team from the European Southern Observatory led by Gaël Chauvin. It is believed to be from 3 to 10 times the mass of Jupiter and may orbit 2M1207 at a distance roughly as far from the brown dwarf as Pluto is from the Sun.\n\nThe object is a very hot gas giant; the estimated surface temperature is roughly 1600 K (1300 °C or 2400 °F), mostly due to gravitational contraction. Its mass is well below the calculated limit for deuterium fusion in brown dwarfs, which is 13 Jupiter masses. The projected distance between 2M1207b and its primary is around 40 AU (similar to the mean distance between Pluto and the Sun). Its infrared spectrum indicates the presence of water molecules in its atmosphere. The object is not a likely candidate to support life, either on its surface or on any satellites.\n\n2M1207b is around 100 times fainter in the sky than its companion. It was first spotted as a \"faint reddish speck of light\" in 2004 by the VLT. After the initial observation, there was some question as to whether the objects might be merely an optical double, but subsequent observations by the \"Hubble Space Telescope\" and the VLT have shown that the objects move together and are therefore presumably a binary system.\n\nAn initial photometric estimate for the distance to 2M1207b was 70 parsecs. In December 2005, American astronomer Eric Mamajek reported a more accurate distance (53 ± 6 parsecs) to 2M1207b using the moving-cluster method. Recent trigonometric parallax results have confirmed this moving-cluster distance, leading to a distance estimate of 52.75 parsecs or 172 ± 3 light years.\n\nEstimates for the mass, size, and temperature of 2M1207b are still uncertain. Although spectroscopic evidence is consistent with a mass of 8 ± 2 Jupiter masses and a surface temperature of 1600 ± 100 kelvins, theoretical models for such an object predict a luminosity 10 times greater than observed. Because of this, lower estimates for the mass and temperature have been proposed. Alternatively, 2M1207b might be dimmed by a surrounding disk of dust and gas. As an unlikely possibility, Mamajek and Michael Meyer have suggested that the planet is actually much smaller, but is radiating away heat generated by a recent collision.\n\nAlthough the mass of 2M1207b is less than that required for deuterium fusion to occur, some 13 times the mass of Jupiter, and the image of 2M1207b has been widely hailed as the first direct image of an exoplanet, it may be questioned whether 2M1207b is actually a planet. Some definitions of the term \"planet\" require a planet to have formed in the same way as the planets in the Solar System did, by secondary accretion in a protoplanetary disk. With such a definition, if 2M1207b formed by direct gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula, it would be a sub-brown dwarf rather than a planet. A similar debate exists regarding the identity of GQ Lupi b, also first imaged in 2004. On the other hand, the discovery of marginal cases like Cha 110913-773444—a free-floating, planetary-mass object—raises the question of whether distinction by formation is a reliable dividing line between stars/brown dwarfs and planets. As of 2006, the International Astronomical Union Working Group on Extrasolar Planets described 2M1207b as a \"possible planetary-mass companion to a brown dwarf.\"\n\n\n"}

Early in his career Kalvik found success putting music to the poetry of popular Norwegian writers André Bjerke and Inger Hagerup. He made his breakthrough in 1969 with the song \"Finne meg sjæl\", and he also had major hits in 1971 with \"En tur rundt i byen\" (based on Ralph McTell's \"Streets Of London\") and in 1975 with \"Ride ranke\" (based on Harry Chapin's \"Cat's in the Cradle\").\n\nHis first four albums reached top 15 on the Norwegian record charts: \"Tusenfryd og grå hverdag\" (1971), \"Finn\" (1972), \"Nøkkelen ligger under matta\" (1974) and \"Fyll mine seil\" (1976). The 1979 album \"Kom ut kom fram\" (1979) was produced by ABBA member/composer Benny Andersson; so was the 1981 album \"Natt og dag\". The 1982 album \"Tenn dine vakre øyne\" reached top 20 on the charts.\n\nOne of the songs on \"Natt og dag\" was \"Aldri i livet\" (Never in my life), with which Kalvik won the Norwegian Melodi Grand Prix in 1981. However his performance in the European finals ended with an infamous zero points. The song was still a big success in Norway, and was even recorded in English as \"Here in My Heart\" with lyrics by Ralph McTell and backing vocals by ABBA's Agnetha Fältskog and Annifrid Lyngstad. He returned to Melodi Grand Prix once more in 1987 when he sang his song \"Malene\" to a fourth place in the Norwegian selection. The song was dedicated to his daughter.\n\nLater albums include \"Det søte liv\" (1984), \"Livets lyse side\" (1988), \"Innsida ut\" (1991), \"I egne hender\" (1995), \"Imellom to evigheter\" (2000), \"Klassisk Kalvik\" (2002), \"Dagdrivernotater\" (2004) and \"Klassisk Kalvik II\" (2005). The two \"Klassisk Kalvik\" albums were re-recordings of old songs with a symphony orchestra. In 2000 Kalvik also scored a hit with a version of Andersson's song \"Tröstevisa\", performed as a duet with Swedish singer CajsaStina Åkerström.\n\nKalvik is also an avid painter.\n\nIn 1998 the comedy program \"Åpen post\" featured a segment called \"Finn Kalvik-nyhetene\", Finn Kalvik news, where jokes were made about Kalvik. The segment caused mental distress for Kalvik, and the jokesters Harald Eia and Bård Tufte Johansen had to apologize publicly (via the show's producer, Lars Hognestad).\n"}

The Gardens have existed for more than a century, and are one of the oldest roadside tourist attractions in the United States. The Gardens are now operated by the City of St. Petersburg, FL and maintained with the help of volunteers. Sunken Gardens are open to the public every day of the week. An admission fee is charged for entrance into the gardens and a yearly membership is also available.\n\nSunken Gardens retains their historical interest as an important example of a 1930s Florida roadside commercial attraction, and is probably the oldest commercial tourist attraction on Florida's west coast. The Gardens are open to the public for educational programs, tours, and special events, particularly weddings which have taken place for decades on the Wedding Lawn, and in the banquet facilities in the Garden Room overlooking the unique garden setting.\n\nThe Gardens began in 1903, when plumber and avid gardener George Turner Sr. purchased six acres of land , including a shallow lake below sea level, which he drained to form his private \"sunken\" garden. Turner started planting papayas and citrus fruits along with other exotic plants on the rich soil surrounding his home. By the 1920s, Turner had opened a nursery and began selling fruits, vegetables, and other plants, and visitors were paying a nickel each to stroll through the gardens. In the fall of 1935, he fenced his garden and started charging an admission fee of 25 cents. The Gardens eventually became widely popular, and from the 1950s through the 1970s were ranked among Florida's top ten commercial attractions. After George's death in 1961, his sons, Ralph and George Jr. continued to run the gardens, which were eventually passed on to Ralph's three sons. They eventually sold it to the city in 1999 for more than $2.26 million.\n\nThe Gardens include a large building originally known as the Sanitary Public Market, first constructed in 1926-27, and designed by architect Albert Lee Hawes. It was a Mediterranean Revival style arcade with twin Moorish towers, cast stone trim, and a tile roof. In 1940, it was converted for use as the Coca-Cola Bottling Company, and restyled in Art Moderne. The Turner family purchased the building in 1967 to create the World's Largest Gift Shop and the King of Kings Wax Museum, adding faux lava portions at that time. In 1999, it was purchased by the City of St. Petersburg, along with the adjoining gardens, using a voter-approved tax. The Gardens were designated as a local historic landmark and treated to several years' efforts of restoration. On June 27, 2002, the former Sanitary Public Market building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, and is now the home of a children's science museum called Great Explorations.\n\nThe Gardens currently contain over 500 species of tropical and subtropical plants amidst pools and cascading waterfalls, lushly planted in a collection of more than 50,000 tropical plants and flowers. They include a Japanese garden, cactus garden, and butterfly garden, and Chilean flamingos. Plants include bougainvilleas, royal palms, water lilies, shrimp plants, and fruit trees. The garden atmosphere is peaceful and many of the plants are quite large (compared to typical specimens) due to their long history of protection and cultivation.\n\nIn 2016, Sunken Gardens acquired a new young flock of 20 Flamingos from the San Antonio Zoo. They joined elderly flamingo residents, George and Lucy, the two remaining Chilean flamingos from the original 17 bird flock that have been on exhibit since 1956. The new flamingos were purchased with funds raised by a nonprofit group, Flamingos Forever, composed of volunteers. Additionally, the city purchased a $30,000 nighttime enclosure for the new flock. Flamingos Forever changed their name to Sunken Gardens Forever, after the acquisition of the new flock, and St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman named May \"Sunken Gardens Forever Appreciation Month\" in St. Petersburg, FL, in honor of their fundraising efforts.\n\nSunken Gardens offers horticulture and other education programs for children and adults. Examples include \"Cameras and Kids\" where children learn nature photography skills with their own camera or smartphone, \"Propagation Techniques,\" \"Growing Microgreens,\" \"Rain Gardens and Barrels,\" and \"Think Outside the Pot: Mounting Orchids\". Programs are often free with membership and are included with paid admission, though some include a fee in addition to standard admission.\n\n\n"}

In addition to charter aviation and an aviation workshop, it offered until 2017 a scheduled service between Bergen and Notodden Airport, Tuven. The airline operated two Beechcraft B200 King Air aircraft and one Cessna Citation CJ2. The airline was established in 1998, offering seaplane charter flights using Cessna 421 aircraft. The service to Notodden started in 2000; a Cessna 441 was acquired in 2003, and from 2006 the company used two Beechcraft. The company is owned by Geir Hellsten and Håkon Lie-Nielsen.\n\nThis airline is not to be confused with Bergen Air Transport (1967), which operated from approximately 1967 to 1981 with Douglas DC-3, DC-4 und DHC-2 Beaver. \n\nBergen Air Transport was founded in 1998 by Geir Hellsten and Håkon Lie-Nielsen, and commenced operations the following year. Initial operations consisted of charter services, using a Cessna 421B.

{"id": "1821375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821375", "title": "Spanish transition to democracy", "text": "Spanish transition to democracy\n\nThe Spanish transition to democracy (, ), known in Spain as the Transition (, ) or the Spanish transition (, ), is a period of modern Spanish history that started on 20 November 1975, the date of death of Francisco Franco, who had established a dictatorship after the victory of the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. However, historians disagree on the exact date the transition was completed: some say it ended after the 1977 general election, while others place it later, when the 1978 Constitution was approved. Others suggest it ended with the failure of the 1981 attempted \"coup d'état\". At its latest, the Transition is said to have ended with the first peaceful transfer of executive power, after the victory of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) in the 1982 general election.\n\nFrancisco Franco came to power in 1939, following the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), and ruled as a dictator until his death in 1975. In 1969, he designated Prince Juan Carlos, grandson of Spain's most recent king, Alfonso XIII, as his official successor. For the next six years, Prince Juan Carlos initially remained in the background during public appearances and seemed ready to follow in Franco's footsteps. Once in power as King of Spain, however, he facilitated the development of a constitutional monarchy as his father, Don Juan de Borbón, had advocated since 1946.\n\nThe transition was an ambitious plan that counted on ample support both within and outside of Spain. Western governments, headed by the United States, now favoured a Spanish constitutional monarchy, as did many Spanish and international liberal capitalists.\nPrime Minister Adolfo Suárez's party, the UCD, received a plurality, but not an absolute majority, in both the June 1977 and March 1979 elections. To exercise power, the UCD had to form parliamentary coalitions with other political parties. The government spent much of its time from 1979 working to hold together the many factions within the party itself, as well as their coalitions. In 1980, the Suárez government had for the most part accomplished its goals of transition to democracy and lacked a further clear agenda. Many UCD members were fairly conservative and did not want further change. For example, a bill to legalize divorce caused much dissension inside the UCD, in spite of being supported by the majority of the populace . The UCD coalition fell apart.\n\nThe clashes among the several factions inside the party eroded Suárez's authority and his role as leader. The tension exploded in 1981: Suárez resigned as the head of government, and Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo was appointed, first to lead the new cabinet and later to the presidency of the UCD; social democrats led by Francisco Fernández Ordóñez defected from the coalition, later joining the PSOE, while Christian democrats left to form the People's Democratic Party.\n\nWhile the democratic normalization had succeeded in convincing ETA (pm), the \"political-military\" faction of ETA, to abandon arms and enter parliamentary politics, it did not stop the continuation of terrorist attacks by ETA (m) (\"ETA Military\"; later simply \"ETA\") or to a lesser extent, GRAPO. Meanwhile, restlessness in various sections of the armed forces created fear of an impending military coup. The attempted coup known as 23-F, in which Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Tejero led an occupation by a group of \"Guardia Civil\" of the Congress of Deputies on the afternoon of 23 February 1981 failed, but demonstrated the existence of insurrectionary elements within the army.\n\nCalvo Sotelo dissolved parliament and called for elections in October 1982. In the 1979 election the UCD had achieved a plurality, but in 1982 it suffered a spectacular defeat with only 11 seats in the Parliament. The 1982 elections gave an absolute majority to the PSOE, which had already spent many years preparing its image of an alternative government.\n\nAt the 28th Congress of the PSOE (May 1979), secretary-general Felipe González resigned rather than ally with the strong revolutionary elements that seemed to dominate the party. A special congress was called that September, and realigned the party along more moderate lines, renouncing Marxism and allowing González to take charge once more.\n\nThroughout 1982, the PSOE confirmed its moderate orientation and brought in the social democrats who had just broken from the UCD.\n\nWinning an absolute majority in parliament in two consecutive elections (1982 and 1986), and exactly half the seats in 1989, allowed the PSOE to legislate and govern without establishing pacts with the other parliamentary political forces. In this way, the PSOE could make laws to achieve the goals of its political program, \"\"el cambio\"\" (\"the change\"). At the same time, the PSOE led many local and regional administrations. This comfortable political majority allowed the PSOE to give the country a long period of tranquility and stability, after the intense years of the transition.\n\n"}

He lived as a hermit close to the abbey until the death of the monastery's abbot, Saint Eustace of Luxeuil, when Waldebert was elected Luxeuil's third abbot (c. 628).\n\nHe was abbot of the monastery for forty years, during which the school of Luxeuil trained the Frankish aristocrats who became bishops in the Frankish kingdoms; Waldebert added the Benedictine Rule to the Rule of St. Columban, though in the rule he drew up for the convent of Faremoutiers he drew upon the rules of Columbanus as well as Benedict, but made no mention whatsoever of a ritual of either profession or oblation. He also gained from Pope John IV the independence of his community from episcopal control and increased the size and prosperity of the monastery's territories and buildings.

{"id": "1821380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821380", "title": "Alpine style", "text": "Alpine style\n\nAlpine style is mountaineering in a self-sufficient manner, thereby carrying all of one's food, shelter and equipment as one climbs, as opposed to expedition style (or siege style) mountaineering which involves setting up a fixed line of stocked camps on the mountain which can be accessed at one's leisure. Additionally, alpine style climbing means the refusal of fixed ropes, high-altitude porters, supplemental oxygen and portable hyperbaric bag. \n\nMany consider alpine style to be the most aesthetically \"pure\" form of mountaineering, setting a standard to which all mountaineers should aspire. This style became well-known and popular with Reinhold Messner, when he and Peter Habeler climbed Gasherbrum I (K5) without oxygen equipment in 1975. Earlier, Wojciech Kurtyka began alpine-style climbing at high altitudes (1972 - Akher Tsagh (7017 m) and Kohe Tez (7015 m)). It was Hermann Buhl's idea to demonstrate alpine style in the Karakoram at the successful Austrian Broad Peak expedition in 1957; in pure alpine style the members of this expedition later climbed Skil Brum (Marcus Schmuck and Fritz Wintersteller) and approached Chogolisa (Hermann Buhl and Kurt Diemberger).\n\nThe benefits of alpine style include spending much less time on the route, thereby reducing objective dangers such as avalanches or blizzards. This can be a major factor on routes with ice fields full of blocks of ice hundreds of feet tall which could fall at any time. Snow and icy conditions often change over the course of a day forcing climbing parties to climb in the early hours before the sun melts the snow or ice making it unsuitable and more susceptible to avalanche. This tendency to climb in the morning has led to the term \"Alpine Start\". An \"Alpine Start\" is an early start that ranges from starting at 11:00pm of the night before on long routes, to not long before sunrise for shorter routes or faster parties. An \"Alpine Start\" must begin in the dark.\n\nThe problems encountered while alpine style climbing are related to lack of support and potentially the lack of acclimatization associated with spending less time at very high altitudes. Without fixed ropes to retreat down in case of emergency, or a lower camp to return to, the commitment of alpine style is greater than expedition style in terms of the choice to ascend or descend. A climbing group caught at a point where conditions do not allow further ascent must consider other options such as an unplanned bivouac (perhaps without the appropriate gear), rappels (leaving multiple pieces of protection behind), or moving to another route from their current position (perhaps without adequate knowledge of an alternative route). However, alpine style often is cheaper and faster for those on a budget, as alpine style climbing typically involves less equipment, and eliminates the need to hire porters.\n"}

He was the son of Sir Francis Palgrave and Elizabeth Turner, daughter of the banker Dawson Turner. His brothers were Francis Turner Palgrave, Inglis Palgrave and Reginald Palgrave. He was educated at Charterhouse School, then occupying its original site near Smithfield, and under the head-mastership of Dr. Saunders, afterwards Dean of Peterborough. Among other honours he won the school gold medal for classical verse, and proceeded to Trinity College, Oxford, where he obtained a scholarship, graduating First Class Lit. Hum., Second Class Math., 1846.\n\nHe went straight from college to India, and served for a time in the 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot, Bombay Native Infantry, H.I.C. Shortly after this he became a Roman Catholic, was ordained a priest, and joined the order of the Jesuits, (Society of Jesus), and served as a member of the order in India, Rome, and in Syria, where he acquired a colloquial command of Arabic.\n\nHe convinced his superiors to support a mission to the interior of Arabia, which at that time was \"terra incognita\" to the rest of the world. He also gained the support of the French emperor, Napoleon III, representing to him that better knowledge of Arabia would benefit French imperialistic schemes in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nPalgrave then returned to Syria, where he assumed the identity of a travelling Syrian physician. Stocking his bags with medicines and small trade goods, and accompanied by one servant, he set off for Najd, in north-central Arabia. He traveled as a Christian. The service he would do for the Society of Jesus and the French empire would be as a spy, not a missionary.\n\nPalgrave became friendly with Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah Al Saud while in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Faisal's son, Abdul Rahman bin Faisal, asked Palgrave to get him strychnine. Palgrave believed that Abdul wanted it to poison his father. Palgrave was accused of espionage and was almost executed for his Christian beliefs.\n\nAfter travelling for a year from Syria, through Najd, and on to Bahrain and Oman, he returned to Europe, where he wrote a narrative of his travels. This narrative became a bestseller and has been reprinted many times. It makes no mention of the covert motives for his journey.\n\nAfter writing this book, Palgrave made yet another \"volte-face\" and renounced the Catholic Church in 1865. He then entered the British Foreign Office and was appointed consul at Sukhum-Kale (Sukhumi) in 1866, and moved to Trebizond (Trabzon) in 1867. In 1868 he married Katherine, the daughter of George Edward Simpson, of Norwich, by whom he had three sons. He was appointed consul at St. Thomas and St. Croix in 1873, Manila in 1876, and in 1878 in Bulgaria, where he was appointed Consul-General. In 1879 he was moved to Bangkok. In 1884 he was appointed Minister Resident and Consul-General to Uruguay, where he served until his death in 1888.\n\n<br>\nBesides his work on \"Central Arabia\", Gifford Palgrave published a volume of \"Essays on Eastern Questions,\" a narrative called \"Hermann Agha,\" a sketch of \"Dutch Guiana\", and a volume of essays titled \"Ulysses\".\n\n\n"}

It was released, on the Virgin label, in 1975. It consists of two side-long compositions mixed from studio recordings and the UK portion of their August–October 1975 European Tour. The sound of the album is similar to that of the group's other \"Virgin Years\" releases, relying heavily on synthesizers and sequencers to produce a dense, ambient soundscape, but is much more energetic than their previous works. \"Ricochet\" uses more percussion and electric guitar than its predecessors \"Phaedra\" and \"Rubycon\", and borders on electronic rock. The main innovation on the album is the use of complex, multi-layered rhythms, foreshadowing the band's own direction in the 1980s and trance music and similar genres of electronic dance music.\n\nAccording to the official \"In Search Of Hades\" boxed set, Part 1 was entirely recorded at The Manor Studio in England. The opening synthesizer line was based on the opening of the show at the Fairfield Halls in Croydon, but was rerecorded for the album. The rest of Part 1 was entirely created in-studio by the band from several improvised sessions.\n\nMost of Part 2 was recorded at Croydon during Tangerine Dream's live performance there on 23 October 1975. The original, unedited version of this performance can be heard in set 3 of \"The Bootleg Box Set Vol. 1\". No other concerts were recorded for the Ricochet album. The piano solo at the beginning of Part 2 was recorded by Edgar Froese on an old upright piano at The Manor Studio. Immediately after the Croydon concert the band brought a four-track recording of the show to The Manor. Each band member's equipment rig had been recorded on a single channel, and a fourth channel was used for an audience mic to capture crowd noise and overall ambience. The band selected two roughly eight-minute sections from the performance and edited down the individual parts performed by the band members in those sections, mixing each bandmember's parts in and out and panning the tracks to simulate a stereo field. A brief vocal-effects section serves as a bridge between the two live excerpts, which were extracted from different sections of the Croydon performance.\n\nAfter the Top 20 placings for \"Phaedra\" and \"Rubycon\", \"Ricochet\" fared less well in sales, spending four weeks on the UK album chart, (all editions of the now defunct \"British Hit Albums\" erroneously state only two), reaching number 40.\n\nIn the original release of \"Ricochet\", the sound of two hands clapping can be heard at the beginning of the second track. This is the final bit of applause before the music started, and was possibly left as a buffer before the start of the piece. This sound has been edited out in some of the re-released versions of the album, notably Virgin's 1995 \"Definitive Edition\" CD release, being possibly regarded as noise.\n\n\n7-inch promotional singles were issued in France and Australia, featuring excerpts from the full album:\n"}
{"id": "1821411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821411", "title": "Diamond-like carbon", "text": "Diamond-like carbon\n\nDiamond-like carbon (DLC) is a class of amorphous carbon material that displays some of the typical properties of diamond. DLC is usually applied as coatings to other materials that could benefit from some of those properties.\n\nDLC exists in seven different forms. All seven contain significant amounts of sp hybridized carbon atoms. The reason that there are different types is that even diamond can be found in two crystalline polytypes. The more common one has its carbon atoms arranged in a cubic lattice, while the less common one, lonsdaleite, has a hexagonal lattice. By mixing these polytypes in various ways at the nanoscale level of structure, DLC coatings can be made that at the same time are amorphous, flexible, and yet purely sp bonded \"diamond\". The hardest, strongest, and slickest is such a mixture, known as tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C). For example a coating of only 2 μm thickness of \"ta-C\" increases the resistance of common (e.g., type 304) stainless steel against abrasive wear, changing its lifetime in such service from one week to 85 years. Such \"ta-C\" can be considered to be the \"pure\" form of DLC, since it consists only of sp bonded carbon atoms. Fillers such as hydrogen, graphitic sp carbon, and metals are used in the other 6 forms to reduce production expenses or to impart other desirable properties.\n\nThe various forms of DLC can be applied to almost any material that is compatible with a vacuum environment. In 2006, the market for outsourced DLC coatings was estimated as about €30,000,000 in the European Union. In October 2011, \"Science Daily\" reported that researchers at Stanford University have created a super-hard amorphous diamond under conditions of ultrahigh pressure, which lacks the crystalline structure of diamond but has the light weight characteristic of carbon.\n\nNaturally occurring diamond is almost always found in the crystalline form with a purely cubic orientation of sp bonded carbon atoms. Sometimes there are lattice defects or inclusions of atoms of other elements that give color to the stone, but the lattice arrangement of the carbons remains cubic and bonding is purely sp. The internal energy of the cubic polytype is slightly lower than that of the hexagonal form and growth rates from molten material in both natural and bulk synthetic diamond production methods are slow enough that the lattice structure has time to grow in the lowest energy (cubic) form that is possible for sp bonding of carbon atoms. In contrast, DLC is typically produced by processes in which high energy precursive carbons (e.g. in plasmas, in filtered cathodic arc deposition, in sputter deposition and in ion beam deposition) are rapidly cooled or quenched on relatively cold surfaces. In those cases cubic and hexagonal lattices can be randomly intermixed, layer by atomic layer, because there is no time available for one of the crystalline geometries to grow at the expense of the other before the atoms are \"frozen\" in place in the material. Amorphous DLC coatings can result in materials that have no long-range crystalline order. Without long range order there are no brittle fracture planes, so such coatings are flexible and conformal to the underlying shape being coated, while still being as hard as diamond. In fact this property has been exploited to study atom-by-atom wear at the nanoscale in DLC.\n\nThere are several methods producing DLC, which rely on the lower density of sp than sp carbon. So the application of pressure, impact, catalysis, or some combination of these at the atomic scale can force sp bonded carbon atoms closer together into sp bonds. This must be done vigorously enough that the atoms cannot simply spring back apart into separations characteristic of sp bonds. Usually techniques either combine such a compression with a push of the new cluster of sp bonded carbon deeper into the coating so that there is no room for expansion back to separations needed for sp bonding; or the new cluster is buried by the arrival of new carbon destined for the next cycle of impacts. It is reasonable to envisage the process as a \"hail\" of projectiles that produce localized, faster, nanoscale versions of the classic combinations of heat and pressure that produce natural and synthetic diamond. Because they occur independently at many places across the surface of a growing film or coating, they tend to produce an analog of a cobblestone street with the cobbles being nodules or clusters of sp bonded carbon. Depending upon the particular \"recipe\" being used, there are cycles of deposition of carbon and impact or continuous proportions of new carbon arriving and projectiles conveying the impacts needed to force the formation of the sp bonds. As a result, \"ta-C\" may have the structure of a cobblestone street, or the nodules may \"melt together\" to make something more like a sponge or the cobbles may be so small as to be nearly invisible to imaging. A classic \"medium\" morphology for a \"ta-C\" film is shown in the figure.\n\nAs implied by the name, diamond-like carbon (DLC), the value of such coatings accrues from their ability to provide some of the properties of diamond to surfaces of almost any material. The primary desirable qualities are hardness, wear resistance, and slickness (DLC film friction coefficient against polished steel ranges from 0.05 to 0.20 ). DLC properties highly depends on plasma treatment deposition parameters, like effect of bias voltage, DLC coating thickness, interlayer thickness, etc. Moreover, the heat treatment also change the coating properties such as hardness, toughness and wear rate.\n\nHowever, which properties are added to a surface and to what degree depends upon which of the 7 forms are applied, and further upon the amounts and types of diluents added to reduce the cost of production. In 2006 the Association of German Engineers, VDI, the largest engineering association in Western Europe issued an authoritative report VDI2840 in order to clarify the existing multiplicity of confusing terms and trade names. It provides a unique classification and nomenclature for diamond-like-carbon (DLC) and diamond films. It succeeded in reporting all information necessary to identify and to compare different DLC films which are offered on the market. Quoting from that document:These [sp] bonds can occur not only with crystals - in other words, in solids with long-range order - but also in amorphous solids where the atoms are in a random arrangement. In this case there will be bonding only between a few individual atoms and not in a long-range order extending over a large number of atoms. The bond types have a considerable influence on the material properties of amorphous carbon films. If the sp type is predominant the film will be softer, if the sp type is predominant the film will be harder. A secondary determinant of quality was found to be the fractional content of hydrogen. Some of the production methods involve hydrogen or methane as a catalyst and a considerable percentage of hydrogen can remain in the finished DLC material. When it is recalled that the soft plastic, polyethylene is made from carbon that is bonded purely by the diamond-like sp bonds, but also includes chemically bonded hydrogen, it is not surprising to learn that fractions of hydrogen remaining in DLC films degrade them almost as much as do residues of sp bonded carbon. The VDI2840 report confirmed the utility of locating a particular DLC material onto a 2-dimensional map on which the X-axis described the fraction of hydrogen in the material and the Y-axis described the fraction of sp bonded carbon atoms. The highest quality of diamond-like properties was affirmed to be correlated with the proximity of the map point plotting the (X,Y) coordinates of a particular material to the upper left corner at (0,1), namely 0% hydrogen and 100% sp bonding. That \"pure\" DLC material is \"ta-C\" and others are approximations that are degraded by diluents such as hydrogen, sp bonded carbon, and metals. Valuable properties of materials that are \"ta-C\", or nearly \"ta-C\" follow.\n\nWithin the \"cobblestones\", nodules, clusters, or \"sponges\" (the volumes in which local bonding is sp) bond angles may be distorted from those found in either pure cubic or hexagonal lattices because of intermixing of the two. The result is internal (compressive) stress that can appear to add to the hardness measured for a sample of DLC. Hardness is often measured by nanoindentation methods in which a finely pointed stylus of natural diamond is forced into the surface of a specimen. If the sample is so thin that there is only a single layer of nodules, then the stylus may enter the DLC layer between the hard cobblestones and push them apart without sensing the hardness of the sp bonded volumes. Measurements would be low. Conversely, if the probing stylus enters a film thick enough to have several layers of nodules so it cannot be spread laterally, or if it enters on top of a cobblestone in a single layer, then it will measure not only the real hardness of the diamond bonding, but an apparent hardness even greater because the internal compressive stress in those nodules would provide further resistance to penetration of the material by the stylus. Nanoindentation measurements have reported hardness as great as 50% more than values for natural crystalline diamond. Since the stylus is blunted in such cases or even broken, actual numbers for hardness that exceed that of natural diamond are meaningless. They only show that the hard parts of an optimal \"ta-C\" material will break natural diamond rather than the inverse. Nevertheless, from a practical viewpoint it does not matter how the resistance of a DLC material is developed, it can be harder than natural diamond in usage. One method of testing the coating hardness is by means of the Persoz pendulum.\n\nThe same internal stress that benefits the hardness of DLC materials makes it difficult to bond such coatings to the substrates to be protected. The internal stresses try to \"pop\" the DLC coatings off of the underlying samples. This challenging downside of extreme hardness is answered in several ways, depending upon the particular \"art\" of the production process. The most simple is to exploit the natural chemical bonding that happens in cases in which incident carbon ions supply the material to be impacted into sp bonded carbon atoms and the impacting energies that are compressing carbon volumes condensed earlier. In this case the first carbon ions will impact the surface of the item to be coated. If that item is made of a carbide-forming substance such as Ti or Fe in steel a layer of carbide will be formed that is later bonded to the DLC grown on top of it. Other methods of bonding include such strategies as depositing intermediate layers that have atomic spacings that grade from those of the substrate to those characteristic of sp bonded carbon. In 2006 there were as many successful recipes for bonding DLC coatings as there were sources of DLC.\n\nDLC coatings are often used to prevent wear due to their excellent tribological properties. DLC is very resistant to abrasive and adhesive wear making it suitable for use in applications that experience extreme contact pressure, both in rolling and sliding contact. DLC is often used to prevent wear on razor blades and metal cutting tools, including lathe inserts and milling cutters. DLC is used in bearings, cams, cam followers, and shafts in the automobile industry. The coatings reduce wear during the 'break-in' period, where drive train components may be starved for lubrication.\n\nDLCs may also be used in chameleon coatings that are designed to prevent wear during launch, orbit, and re-entry of land-launched space vehicles. DLC provides lubricity at ambient atmosphere and at vacuum unlike graphite, which requires moisture to be lubricious. Isolated carbon particles embedded diamond-like carbon coatings are the recent development in this area. The wear rate of amorphous DLC can be reduced up to 60% by embedding isolated carbon nanoparticles embedded simultaneous to DLC deposition. The isolated particles were in-situ created through rapid plasma quenching with Helium pulses.\n\nDespite the favorable tribological properties of DLC it must be used with caution on ferrous metals. If it is used at higher temperatures, the substrate or counter face may carburize, which could lead to loss of function due to a change in hardness. The final, end use temperature of a coated component should be kept below the temperature at which a PVC DLC coating is applied.\n\nIf a DLC material is close enough to \"ta-C\" on plots of bonding ratios and hydrogen content it can be an insulator with a high value of resistivity. Perhaps more interesting is that if prepared in the \"medium\" cobblestone version such as shown in the above figure, electricity is passed through it by a mechanism of hopping conductivity. In this type of conduction of electricity the electrons move by quantum mechanical tunneling between pockets of conductive material isolated in an insulator. The result is that such a process makes the material something like a semiconductor. Further research on electrical properties is needed to explicate such conductivity in \"ta-C\" in order to determine its practical value. However, a different electrical property of emissivity has been shown to occur at unique levels for \"ta-C\". Such high values allow for electrons to be emitted from \"ta-C\" coated electrodes into vacuum or into other solids with application of modest levels of applied voltage. This has supported important advances in medical technology.\n\nApplications of DLC typically utilize the ability of the material to reduce abrasive wear. Tooling components, such as endmills, drill bits, dies and molds often use DLC in this manner. DLC is also used in the engines of modern supersport motorcycles, Formula 1 racecars, NASCAR vehicles, and as a coating on hard-disk platters and hard-disk read heads to protect against head crashes. Virtually all of the multi-bladed razors used for wet shaving have the edges coated with hydrogen-free DLC to reduce friction, preventing abrasion of sensitive skin. It is also being used as a coating by some weapon manufacturers/custom gunsmiths. Some forms have been certified in the EU for food service and find extensive uses in the high-speed actions involved in processing novelty foods such as potato chips and in guiding material flows in packaging foodstuffs with plastic wraps. DLC coats the cutting edges of tools for the high-speed, dry shaping of difficult exposed surfaces of wood and aluminium, for example on automobile dashboards.\n\nThe wear, friction, and electrical properties of DLC make it an appealing material for medical applications. Fortunately, DLC has proved to have excellent bio-compatibility as well. This has enabled many medical procedures, such as Percutaneous coronary intervention employing brachytherapy to benefit from the unique electrical properties of DLC. At low voltages and low temperatures electrodes coated with DLC can emit enough electrons to be arranged into disposable, micro-X-ray tubes as small as the radioactive seeds that are introduced into arteries or tumors in conventional brachytherapy. The same dose of prescribed radiation can be applied \"from the inside, out\" with the additional possibility to switch on and off the radiation in the prescribed pattern for the X-rays being used. DLC has proved to be an excellent coating to prolong the life of and reduce complications with replacement hip joints and artificial knees. It also has been successfully applied to coronary artery stents, reducing the incidence of thrombosis. The implantable human heart pump can be considered the ultimate biomedical application where DLC coating is used on blood contacting surfaces of the key components of the device.\n\nThe Space Black stainless steel Apple Watch is coated with diamond-like carbon.\n\nThe increase in lifetime of articles coated with DLC that wear out because of abrasion can be described by the formula \"f = (g)\", where \"g\" is a number that characterizes the type of DLC, the type of abrasion, the substrate material and μ is the thickness of the DLC coating in μm. For \"low-impact\" abrasion (pistons in cylinders, impellers in pumps for sandy liquids, etc.), \"g\" for pure \"ta-C\" on 304 stainless steel is 66. This means that one-μm thickness (that is ≈5% of the thickness of a human hair-end) would increase service lifetime for the article it coated from a week to over a year and two-μm thickness would increase it from a week to 85 years. These are measured values; though in the case of the 2 μm coating the lifetime was extrapolated from the last time the sample was evaluated until the testing apparatus itself wore out.\n\nThere are environmental arguments that a sustainable economy ought to encourage articles not engineered to lower performance or to fail prematurely. This in turn will reduce the need to support greater production of units and their frequent replacement, which might provide an economic disincentive to manufacturers of such devices.\n\nCurrently there are about 100 outsource vendors of DLC coatings that are loaded with amounts of graphite and hydrogen and so give much lower g-numbers than 66 on the same substrates.\n\n\n"}

This generally happens on a fourth down in American football and a third down in Canadian football. Punters may also occasionally take part in fake punts in those same situations, when they throw or run the football instead of punting.\n\nThe purpose of the punt is to force the team that is receiving the kick to start as far as possible from the kicking team's end zone. Accordingly, the most effective punts land just outside the receiving team's end zone and land either out of bounds (making it impossible to advance the ball until the next play) or after being kicked exceptionally high (allowing the kicking team time to run down the field and prevent the punt returner from advancing the ball). Punters therefore must be able to kick the ball high, long distances, and precisely. One standard is that a punt should be in the air for at least 1 second for every 10 yards it travels, but the linear relationship drops off once it hits over 50 yards. \n\nPunters may also impart a spin to the ball that makes it harder to catch, increasing the odds of a muff that may lead to the punter's team regaining possession.\nThe punter frequently serves as the holder on field goal attempts. The punter has typically developed chemistry with the long snapper and is thus accustomed to catching a long-snapped ball. Additionally, punters are also kickers and understand kicking mechanics, such as how far back to lean the ball as the kicker makes an attempt, and when a field goal attempt should be aborted. Punters may pass or run the ball on fake field goal attempts and fake punts.\n\nMany punters also double duty as kickoff specialists as most punters have been at one point field goal kickers as well, and some, such as Craig Hentrich, have filled in as worthy backup field goal kickers. \nPunters seldom receive much attention or fan support, in part because they are called upon when a team's offense has just failed. \n\nCertain punters can have exceptionally long careers, compared to other NFL position players (there is a similar tendency with kickers). One reason for this is that their limited time on the field and heavy protection by penalties against defensive players for late hits makes them far less likely to be injured than other positions. Sean Landeta, for instance, played 19 NFL seasons and three USFL seasons for eight different teams. Jeff Feagles played 22 seasons as a punter, on five different teams.\n\nConversely, placekickers and punters can also have very short careers, mainly because of a lack of opportunity. Because the risk of injury is remote, NFL teams typically only carry one punter on their roster at any given time. Thus, the only opportunity a punter has of breaking into the league is if the incumbent punter leaves the team or is injured. Some NFL teams will carry two punters during the preseason, but the second punter is typically \"camp fodder\" and seldom makes the opening day roster. Unlike backups at other positions, backup placekickers and punters are not employed by any given team until they are needed; most indoor American football teams, because of smaller rosters and fields along with rules that either ban or discourage punting, do not employ punting specialists.\n\nBob Cameron of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (CFL), in a 23-year career, has the most career punting yards, with 134,301 yards.\n\nJeff Feagles holds the NFL record for career punting yards with 71,211 yards. He played from 1988-2009 for five different teams in the NFL.\n\nFormer Oakland Raiders player Ray Guy is the only pure punter to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, as well as the only pure punter to be picked in the first round of the NFL Draft. Russell Erxleben was selected as the 11th pick in the first round of the 1979 draft by the New Orleans Saints as a punter but performed other kicking duties as well. Guy is credited with raising the status of punters in the NFL because he proved to be a major ingredient in the Raiders' success during the 1970s by preventing opponents from gaining field position advantage.\n\nBefore Guy's arrival in Oakland, many teams trained a position player to double as a punter (the placekicker was likewise expected to \"double-up\" at another position), even after the one-platoon system (which effectively required a punter to play offensive and defensive positions on top of their duties) was abolished in the 1940s. The Green Bay Packers won Super Bowl I and Super Bowl II using running back Donny Anderson as their punter. The Packers' regular placekicker, Don Chandler, was an All-Pro punter with the New York Giants but Vince Lombardi brought Chandler in from his old team to serve exclusively as a kicker after Paul Hornung, who set the NFL single-season scoring record with 176 points in 12 games in 1960, was suspended for gambling in 1963 and suffered a sharp decline in accuracy in 1964. Linebacker Paul Maguire served as a punter for the AFL-champion San Diego Chargers and Buffalo Bills in the 1960s.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, who played in Super Bowl I and won Super Bowl IV, bucked the trend at the time by signing Jerrel Wilson as a punting specialist in 1966. Wilson punted for the Chiefs for 13 seasons, and combined with placekicker Jan Stenerud to give the team one of the best kicking combinations in the league.\n\nBackup quarterbacks were commonly used to punt well into the 1970s. Steve Spurrier, who was stuck behind John Brodie at quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, served as the team's primary punter for the first four years of his career. Bob Lee took on the same role for the Minnesota Vikings in the late 1960s and early 1970s, punting for the club in Super Bowl IV.\n\nDanny White played little as a backup quarterback to Roger Staubach with the Dallas Cowboys from 1976 through 1979, but was the team's primary punter from 1975 through 1984, when he gave up the kicking duties to Mike Saxon.\n\nOne of the last examples of a punting quarterback was Tom Tupa. A quarterback and punter in college, Tupa started his career in the NFL as a quarterback but eventually settled into a role as a full-time punter and emergency quarterback.\n\nLately, NFL teams have been turning to retired Australian rules football players to punt for them, as punting is a basic skill in that game. Darren Bennett, who played for the San Diego Chargers and Minnesota Vikings in his career, was one of the first successful AFL players to make the jump to the United States, doing so in 1994. Ben Graham, who entered the league with the New York Jets, became the first AFL player to play in a Super Bowl when he played in Super Bowl XLIII with the Arizona Cardinals. Graham is now a free agent. Other former AFL players who made the transition to NFL punters include former NFL punter Mat McBriar and Sav Rocca, formerly of the Washington Redskins. In recent years, an increasing number of Australians have been making the transition to gridiron football at earlier ages, with a significant number now playing for U.S. college teams. The five most recent Ray Guy Awards, presented to the top punter in NCAA Division I football, have gone to Australians. Tom Hornsey of the University of Memphis won in 2013, followed by two punters from the University of Utah—Tom Hackett (2014 and 2015) and Mitch Wishnowsky (2016). Michael Dickson of the University of Texas won in 2017. All three finalists for the 2016 award were Australians. In the 2018 season, nearly one-fourth of the schools in college football's top level, Division I FBS, including seven in Utah's home of the Pac-12 Conference, have at least one Australian punter on their roster.\n\nTechnically, Sam Koch revolutionized punting by developing many variations, due to his flexible hips in an effort to increase net punting average by giving the ball variable trajectories and bounce, making it more difficult for returners to catch and return.\n\nThe New England Patriots were noted for almost exclusively employing left-footed punters during the coaching tenure of Bill Belichick, who has claimed the coincidence is unintentional. Left-footed punters have been increasingly used at the NFL level; at the start of the 2001 NFL season, there were 26 right-footed punters, four left-footed ones and one (Chris Hanson) who was dual-footed. By the 2017 NFL season, there were 22 right-footed punters and 10 left-footed ones.\n"}

Tupa played mostly quarterback at Brecksville-Broadview Heights High School; he led his team to the state championship while also lettering in basketball (where he averaged 20.8 points per game) and baseball (where he was a pitcher and shortstop). While in high school, Tupa played on the same basketball team as former NBA head coach Eric Musselman and former NBA forward Scott Roth.\n\nAfter sitting three seasons behind Mike Tomczak and Jim Karsatos, Tupa took over the starting quarterback job at The Ohio State University in 1987, throwing for 2,252 yards, 15 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He was selected as an All-American punter in the same season, as well as All-Big 10. Tupa was a four-time football letterman and was also selected to play in the 1988 Hula Bowl all-star game.\n\nTupa is currently the offensive coordinator at his high school alma mater, Brecksville-Broadview Heights High School, where he called the plays for both his sons. He is also Brecksville's Recreation Director.\n\nHis son Tom Tupa III (high school class of 2013) was a quarterback for Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. His son Tim Tupa (high school class of 2014) played wide receiver for the Bowling Green State University.\nHis son Tyler Tupa (high school class of 2016) currently plays wide receiver for Ohio University.\n\nHe is a first cousin of former Colorado Democratic State Senator and Majority Caucus Leader Ron Tupa.\n\nTupa was drafted in the third round (68th overall) of the 1988 NFL Draft by the Phoenix Cardinals. During his rookie year, he was used exclusively as a quarterback, playing in two games and completing 4-of-5 passes for 49 yards. His second season with the team saw an expanded role. He started two games at quarterback, while registering six punts for 46.7 yards per punt. After spending the entire 1990 season as strictly a holder on kicks, he was the primary quarterback for the Cardinals the following year, playing in 11 games and throwing six touchdowns to 13 interceptions. He then joined the Indianapolis Colts in 1992, playing as a backup quarterback to Jack Trudeau and Jeff George.\n\nThat season also marked the last time Tupa was used regularly as a quarterback; since then he almost exclusively punted, with only emergency occasions or trick plays making use of his throwing skills. Tupa did not play in the 1993 NFL season, having been cut by the Cleveland Browns right before the season and later re-signed as a backup in November following an injury to starting quarterback Vinny Testaverde and the release of backup Bernie Kosar. He was retained by the Browns the following year and stayed with them for two seasons as their starting punter. With the Browns, Tupa scored the first two-point conversion in NFL history, running in a faked extra point kick attempt for the Browns in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals in the first week of the 1994 season. He scored a total of three such conversions that season, earning him the nickname \"Two Point Tupa.\"\n\nTupa joined the New England Patriots in 1996 and played for them for three years. During his Patriots tenure, he played in Super Bowl XXXI, in which the Patriots lost to the Green Bay Packers. He would be named the Patriots' All-1990s Team.\n\nIn 1999, Tupa signed with the New York Jets. It was during this season that Tupa received his first invitation to the Pro Bowl. He also made his first pass attempt since 1996, and went 6-of-11 for 165 yards and two touchdowns during the Jets' week one matchup against his former team, the Patriots. Tupa was put in at quarterback in the first quarter after Vinny Testaverde tore his achilles tendon. Despite his success, the Jets lost the game to the Patriots. He remained with the Jets through the 2001 season.\n\n2002 saw Tupa sign with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he was their punter on their road to Super Bowl XXXVII, where they defeated the Oakland Raiders. Before the start of the 2004 NFL season, Tupa signed with the Washington Redskins. In 2004, he was named as a Pro Bowl second alternate. He spent 2005 on the injured reserve list, and did not appear in a game.\n\nThe final pass of Tupa's career was thrown in an overtime loss in the 2002 season-opener against the New Orleans Saints during a punt attempt from the Buccaneers' five-yard line. Pressure from a Saints defender forced Tupa to abort the punt attempt and throw a desperation pass with his non-throwing arm which was intercepted by a Saints defender and returned for a touchdown, ending the game.\n\nTupa announced his retirement from football in the spring of 2006. In February 2006, he was appointed as the recreation director of Brecksville, Ohio.\n"}

His parents were strict Calvinists. When he was still young, his father quit farming. After time at a chapel school, Fox became a weaver's boy, an errand-boy, and in 1799, a bank clerk. An autodidact, he entered prize competitions.\n\nFrom September 1806 Fox trained for the Independent ministry, at Homerton College. His tutor there was John Pye Smith, the Congregational theologian. Early in 1810 he took charge of a congregation at Fareham in Hampshire. Failing to make a small seceding congregation there viable, he left within two years to become minister of the Unitarian chapel at Chichester.\n\nIn 1817 Fox moved to London, becoming minister of Parliament Court Chapel. In 1824 he moved the congregation to South Place Chapel, in Finsbury on the edge of the City of London, which had been built specifically for him. Around Fox and the chapel there gathered a group of progressive thinkers, including feminists and, through William Lovett, some adherents of Chartism. The circle included Sophia Dobson Collet, who saw some of Fox's sermons into print; Mary Leman Gillies, who wrote on women's rights; and Caroline Ashurst Stansfeld, whose marriage to James Stansfeld was conducted by Fox.\nFox's position as a leading Unitarian minister was jeopardized in 1834-5 when he left his wife for one of his wards, and became an advocate of freer divorce. The Chapel's committee, led by Thomas Field Gibson’s father Thomas Gibson, accepted Fox's resignation, which led to Fox’s removal from the Unitarian ministry and a secession of fifty families from the Chapel. He set up a new household in the Craven Hill area of Bayswater and re-established himself as a preacher of rationalism. Charles Hardwick grouped Fox with Theodore Parker and Robert William Mackay as proponents of \"absolute religion\". Fox's public presence became increasingly that of a commentator on social and political matters. The South Place chapel itself eventually lost its identification with Unitarianism, becoming the South Place Ethical Society.\n\nAs a supporter of the Anti-Corn-Law movement, Fox won celebrity as an impassioned orator and journalist, and from 1847 to 1862 he intermittently represented Oldham in Parliament as a Liberal.\n\nFox died 3 June 1864, in London.\n\nHe was editor of the \"Monthly Repository\", and a frequent contributor to the \"Westminster Review\", and published works on political and religious topics. An edition of his \"Works\" was edited by William Ballantyne Hodgson and Henry James Slack, and appeared from 1865.\n\nThe ambition of Fox was to become a great political orator and debater, in which at last he succeeded. His mental agility was manifest in his reply to an elector whom he had canvassed for a vote, and who offered him a halter [an old euphemism for noose] instead. \"Oh thank you,\" said Fox, \"I would not deprive you of what is evidently a family relic.\"\n\nHis method was to take each argument of an opponent, and dispose of it in regular order. His passion was for argument, upon great or petty subjects. He availed himself of every opportunity to speak. \"During five whole sessions,\" he said, \"I spoke every night but one; and I regret that I did not speak on that night, too.\" - \"Successful Methods of Public Speaking\", 1920\n\nFox was a friend of radical journalist Benjamin Flower. On Flower's death in 1829, his two daughters, Eliza Flower and Sarah Fuller Flower Adams, became Fox's wards. Fox separated from his wife in the 1830s, and, causing much scandal, apparently set up home with Eliza Flower and his children. Following the separation from his wife, Fox brought up his ward himself, living first in Stamford Hill and later Bayswater. One of Fox's daughters, also named Eliza, married Frederick Lee Bridell. Both were accomplished artists.\n"}

Most of the constituency was formerly in the Stamford and Spalding constituency. As well as the two Lincolnshire constituencies that it neighbours (Sleaford and South Holland), it neighbours Rutland and Melton to the west, and North West Cambridgeshire to the south. All five are academically considered, based on results in recent elections, Conservative safe seats.\n\nFollowing a Boundary Commission review for the 2010 election, the constituency's boundary with the Sleaford and North Hykeham constituency saw more wards ceded to the latter seat and all of Truesdale was united into this seat, which before was shared with South Holland and The Deepings. The recommendation saw an estimated electorate size of 73,336. The new boundary does not include Barrowby, Sedgebrook, Great Gonerby or Belton but includes Baston and Langtoft.\n\nThis is a large rural seat in southern Lincolnshire. Grantham and Stamford are at the extreme north and south of the seat, with a large swathe of agricultural countryside between them, dotted with small rural villages. The only other large settlement in the seat is the rapidly growing town of Bourne, situated at the west of the Lincolnshire Fens. Food processing and agriculture are the major industries.\n\nPolitically, Grantham is associated with former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was born and raised in the town. However, the town of Grantham itself probably has the biggest Labour Party support of the constituency. The rural part of the seat and the historical town of Stamford outweigh any Labour votes in Grantham, and it is normally a safe Conservative seat. The history of Conservative representation was briefly interrupted between 2007-10 when the sitting Conservative MP, Quentin Davies defected to Labour, as well as 2019 when an MP, Nick Boles, left the Conservative Party.\n\nWorkless claimants were in November 2012 significantly lower than the national average of 3.8%, at 2.8% of the population based on a statistical compilation by \"The Guardian\".\n\nThe whole constituency lies within the area served by Lincolnshire County Council and South Kesteven District Council.\n\n\n"}

He was attainted with his titles forfeited. However, Lord Nithsdale made a celebrated escape from the Tower of London by changing clothes with his wife's maid the day before he was due to be executed. The lordship of Herries of Terregles was later restored to his descendants and remains extant.\n\nHe was the eldest son of Robert, fourth Earl of Nithsdale (1627/8–1683), and Lady Lucie Douglas (died 1713), daughter of William, eleventh earl of Angus and first Marquess of Douglas. He was probably born at Terregles Castle, near Dumfries. The early death of his father ensured that he was raised by his mother, the Dowager Countess, who educated him to be a faithful and conventionally devout Roman Catholic and a partisan of the Stuart cause.\n\nOn reaching the age of 21, in 1697, he visited the Jacobite court at Saint-Germain to give his allegiance to the exiled King James II and VII, where he met his future wife Lady Winifred Herbert, daughter of the Duke of Powis. After their marriage at Saint-Germain in 1699, they settled at his family seat at Terregles. As a prominent Catholic in the predominantly Covenanting Lowlands, he was on a number of occasions the object of Presbyterian assaults on his estate, on suspicion of harbouring Jesuits.\n\nDespite his discretion, he was long suspected of Jacobite sympathies. In the Jacobite rising of 1715, after some hesitation, he proclaimed James III and VIII at Dumfries and Jedburgh, before joining the main Jacobite forces at Hexham under General Thomas Forster. Nithsdale was captured at Preston together with other Jacobite leaders, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to death. The night before the day appointed for his execution (24 February 1716), he effected an escape from the Tower of London meticulously planned by his daring and devoted Countess, who had been admitted to his room.

The festival claims to be the world's largest tulip festival, displaying over one million tulips, with attendance of over 650,000 visitors annually. Large displays of tulips are planted throughout the city, and the largest display of tulips is found in Commissioners Park on the shores of Dow's Lake, and along the Rideau Canal with 300,000 tulips planted there alone. Millions of tulips set the stage for a celebration of authentic art, cultural, historic, culinary and family tulip experiences at various official venues across the capital.\n\nIn 1945, the Dutch royal family sent 100,000 tulip bulbs to Ottawa in gratitude for Canadians having sheltered the future Queen Juliana and her family for the preceding three years during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands in the Second World War. The most noteworthy event during their time in Canada was the birth in 1943 of Princess Margriet at the Ottawa Civic Hospital. The maternity ward was temporarily declared to be extraterritorial by the Canadian government, thereby allowing Princess Margriet's citizenship to be solely influenced by her mother's Dutch citizenship. In 1946, Juliana sent another 20,500 bulbs requesting that a display be created for the hospital, and promised to send 10,000 more bulbs each year.\n\nIn the years following Queen Juliana's original donation, Ottawa became famous for its tulips and in 1953 the Ottawa Board of Trade and photographer Malak Karsh organized the first \"Canadian Tulip Festival\". Queen Juliana returned to celebrate the festival in 1967, and Princess Margriet returned in 2002 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the festival.\n\nFor many years, the festival featured a series of outdoor music concerts in addition to the tulips.\nThe 1972 festival saw Liberace give an opening concert, and at the 1987 festival, Canadian singer Alanis Morissette made her first appearance at the age of 12. The Trews first became widely known after opening for Big Sugar at the 2003 festival. Montreal's General Rudie also gained valuable exposure early in their career with a performance at the 2000 festival.\n\nAfter several years of cold and rainy weekends drove the festival to the brink of bankruptcy in 2006, the outdoor music concerts were discontinued. Even though concert admission fees were a source of revenue for the festival, rainy weather contributed to low concert attendance on many occasions, making the concerts a heavy financial risk.\n\nIn 2007, the festival was reorganised under new leadership. The festival was redesigned to focus on promoting international friendship, the original symbolic role of the gift of tulips. Park admission charges were eliminated and a new feature called \"Celebridée: a Celebration of Ideas\" was introduced. Another component of the 2007 festival was a fund-raising effort in support of War Child Canada.\n\nBeyond celebrating the tulip as a symbol of beauty and friendship, the Canadian Tulip Festival, through Celebridée, aims to present some of the most brilliant thinkers of our time speaking about ideas that matter. \nCelebridée has continued to grow since its inception in 2007. 2008's speakers included such diverse and thought-provoking individuals as Sir Salman Rushdie, Wired Magazine's Chris Anderson, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of \"Guns, Germs and Steel\" Jared Diamond, and world-renowned pianist Angela Hewitt.\n\nOfficial Sites\n\nAttraction Sites\n\nPartner Sites\n\nBecause of the ongoing Canadian support for the Netherlands during the war, Seymour Cobley of the Royal Horticultural Society actually donated 83,000 tulips to Canada from 1941–1943, several years before the Royal Family followed suit.\n\nWhile the Netherlands continues to send 20,000 bulbs to Canada each year (10,000 from the Royal Family and 10,000 from the Dutch Bulb Growers Association), by 1963 the festival featured more than 2 million, and today sees nearly 3 million tulips purchased from Dutch and Canadian distributors.\n\nPhotographer Malak Karsh became widely known for his photographs of the Tulip Festival.\n\nCommissioner's Park, on the shores of Dow's Lake is a major centre of activity for the Tulip Festival.

Lincoln was a bellwether between 1974 and 2017. The seat bucked the national Conservative victory in 1970 by electing a Labour MP, as it did in 2017.\n\nThe seat has been considered relative to others an ultra-marginal seat, as well as a swing seat, since 2005 as its winner's majority has not exceeded 3.2% of the vote since the 12.5% majority won in 2005 and the seat has changed hands three times since that year.\n\n1918–1950: The County Borough of Lincoln, and the Urban District of Bracebridge.\n\n1950–1974: The County Borough of Lincoln.\n\n1974–1983: As prior but with redrawn boundaries.\n\n1983–1997: The City of Lincoln, and the District of North Kesteven wards of Bracebridge Heath, North Hykeham Central, North Hykeham North, North Hykeham South, Skellingthorpe, and Waddington West.\n\n1997–2010: The City of Lincoln, and the District of North Kesteven ward of Bracebridge Heath.\n\n2010–present: The City of Lincoln, and the District of North Kesteven wards of Bracebridge Heath and Waddington East, and Skellingthorpe.\n\nThe constituency, as its name suggests, covers the cathedral city of Lincoln in Lincolnshire, and most of its directly adjoining villages.\n\nLincoln first sent Members to Parliament in 1265, thirty years before the first all-over coverage of cities and qualifying towns was introduced in the Model Parliament, and has done so ever since, although no records exist from before the end of the 13th century. The early elections were held at the Guildhall and the burgesses elected were usually officials of the borough.\n\nThe representation, originally two Members (\"burgesses\"), was reduced to one Member in 1885.\n\nThe seat was represented for five years by former Cabinet minister Margaret Jackson, later Margaret Beckett. Lincoln became the oldest constituency in the country in 2010 when the City of York constituency was divided.\n\nThe seat includes the University of Lincoln. From 1945 to 1972 Lincoln was continuously held by the Labour Party, often as a safe seat. The city has good transport links with Nottingham, Hull and the smaller ancient market towns in Lincolnshire, such as Spalding, Market Rasen and Boston. Lincoln was a bellwether constituency from October 1974 to 2015, voting for the party which would form the government in each election.

Kacyvenski ( ; born October 3, 1977) is a former American football linebacker of the National Football League. He was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in the fourth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. He played college football at Harvard and earned an MBA from Harvard Business School after he retired.\n\nKacyvenski also spent time with the St. Louis Rams and Oakland Raiders. After spending the 2007 season out of football trying to return from microfracture surgery, Kacyvenski officially announced his retirement in 2008.\n\nIsaiah is currently the Founder and Managing Partner of Will Ventures, a venture capital fund focused on sports technology opening up large, adjacent markets.\n\nIsaiah Kacyvenski was the youngest of five children growing up in upstate Endicott, New York. He grew up at times homeless and without food with his parents; his caring mother and his alcoholic and sometimes abusive father until their divorce when he was nine. When he was thirteen, his mother left to do missionary work, leaving the care of him and his siblings back with their father, now sober.\n\nKacyvenski attended Union-Endicott High School where he was an honors student and served as captain of the football team. His ultimate goal was to earn a football scholarship to University of Notre Dame to play with the Fighting Irish. His mother was killed by a truck as she walked along the road on the same day of Kacyvenski's biggest high school football game in his senior season. Upon hearing of his mother's death, he fell \"to his knees crying.\" He ended up playing in the game that night, calling it one of the best games of his life.\n\nHe received a phone call at the end of his senior year from Harvard Crimson football coach Tim Murphy offering him an academic scholarship. While Kacyvenski was reluctant to go to for fear of not fitting in, his coach convinced him that he would never regret going to Harvard.\n\nWhile he was a freshman at Harvard, Kacyvenski came across items that belonged to his mother. Among the items he found a picture of his mother wearing a Harvard sweatshirt and her Bible with a passage highlighted: \"Can a woman forget her own baby and not love the child she bore? Even if a mother should forget her child, I will never forget you. I can never forget you! I have written you in the palm of my hands.\" – Isaiah 49:15. Kacyvenski took these things as signs that he was making the right decision in his life. Coincidentally, 49 was also the jersey number he had been randomly assigned upon arrival at Harvard.\n\nFor four years, Kacyvenski started every game at Harvard University. As a freshman, he won the Ivy League Rookie of the Year award, and for three years, won All-Ivy League first team honors. As a senior, he had a school single-season record 135 tackles, and for his college career, finished with a school career-record 395 tackles, 4.5 sacks, 11 interceptions, and 8 fumble recoveries. He received the Nils V. \"Swede\" Nelson Award given to \"best, most academically talented\" football player in New England, and also the Harvard University Male Athlete of the Year following his senior season. Isaiah was a finalist for the Buck Buchanan Award that is given to the top 1-AA defensive player in the country, as well as a 1st Team Associated Press All-American.\n\nIn 2000, Kacyvenski was selected in the 4th round of the NFL draft by the Seattle Seahawks and became the highest draft pick in Harvard history. He graduated cum laude with a pre-med degree, but elected to miss his commencement ceremony to attend the first days of football training camp. His father attended the ceremony in cap and gown in Kacyvenski's stead and received the Harvard diploma for his son.\n\nKacyvenski played six-plus seasons with the Seattle Seahawks recording 267 tackles in 90 games and was elected as the Special Teams Captain 3 years in a row. In 2002, Isaiah earned the starting job at Middle Linebacker, after battling for the position with Orlando Huff. In 2005, Kacyvenski was Special Teams Captain of the Seattle Seahawks and helped lead the team to Super Bowl XL, which was played in Detroit, Michigan. He was released by the team on September 30, 2006.\n\nKacyvenski signed a one-year contract with the St. Louis Rams on October 3, 2006, and played in ten games for them during the remainder of the 2006 season after suffering 2 concussions 3 weeks apart.\n\nAn unrestricted free agent in the 2007 offseason, Kacyvenski signed a one-year contract with the Oakland Raiders on July 11. He was placed on season-ending injured reserve on August 7 and released with an injury settlement a week later after undergoing microfracture surgery on his leg.\n\nAfter being released by the Raiders with an injury settlement, Kacyvenski said he wanted to return for another season in the NFL.\n\nHowever, in September 2008, it was reported that Kacyvenski had decided to retire. A knee injury kept him out of the 2007 season and it was recommended by Dr. James Andrews that he not continue playing.\n\nAlso in September, Kacyvenski, the first of five other former NFL players that soon followed, agreed to donate his brain upon his death to the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, a joint program between the Boston University School of Medicine and Sports Legacy Institute in order to have research into the effects of concussions on the human brain performed. Kacyvenski, like many NFL players, suffered a number of concussions over the course of his playing career. At the end of 2008, Isaiah was awarded the PETA Compassionate Action Award after being the first professional athlete to donate his brain to science.\n\nHe was elected to the Board of Directors of Sports Legacy Institute in 2008, and has used this as a platform for awareness surrounding head trauma and making contact sports safer to play.\n\nKacyvenski earned his MBA from Harvard Business School in 2011.\n\nIsaiah is currently the Founder and Managing Partner of Will Ventures. Will Ventures is a venture capital investment fund focused on sports technology opening up the massive, adjacent market opportunities such as Healthcare, IoT, Digital Media, eSports, Nutrition, Sports Medicine, and more.\n\nPrior to Will Ventures, Isaiah was a Founder and Managing Director of the Sports Innovation Lab. A leading market research and advisory firm delivering insights on intersection of sports and technology, the Sports Innovation Lab evaluates and identifies the technology products and services that will power the future of sports. The Boston-based, market research and advisory firm uses data analysis to reveal compelling stories that mobilize global partnerships among startups, investment capital firms, and corporate influencers. \n\nPrior to founding the Sports Innovation Lab, Kacyvenski was one of the first employees to join a very early stage MC10, a cutting-edge conformal electronics company focused on optimizing objective physiological data capture outside of a controlled setting, and remained there for 6 years as the Global Head of Business Development as well as Chairman of the MC10 Sports-Medicine Advisory Board.\n\nKacyvenski is also an individual investor in, and advisor to, several companies in technology, sports, biotech, consumer, media and sports medicine.\n\nOn the July 12, 2007 episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", Kacyvenski appeared as the first guest to talk about his rough childhood and reconciliation with his abusive father.\n\nKacyvenski was featured in an NFL Films production that was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Long Feature in 2007.\n\nOn October 24, 2010, Kacyvenski was invited back to Seattle to raise the famous 12th Man Flag before the Seahawks played the Cardinals.\n\nDuring his time at Harvard, Kacyvenski was roommates with Christopher Nowinski, who later went on to become a WWE wrestler. After retiring from wrestling due to concussions, Nowinski has spearheaded the effort to make sports safer in the United States and worldwide.\n\nAmong his investments, Kacyvenski is a founding investor in b.good, a chain of healthy fast casual restaurants located globally.\n\nKacyvenski was chosen to announce the Seattle Seahawks second round draft pick from the podium during the 2013 NFL Draft, one of 32 NFL Greats chosen.\n\n"}

It is traversed jointly by U.S. Highway 24 (US 24) (between Hartsel and Buena Vista) and US 285 (between Fairplay and Buena Vista). It is passable by most motorized vehicles and is closed only during severe winter storms. The approach from the north is mild, while the south side has a moderate 5% grade.\n\nCuriously, the elevation stated on the highway sign at the summit (see attached picture) appears to be in error by about , as it disagrees with well-established topographic maps as well as published data.\n\nGeologically, the pass is located on a fault that runs along the Mosquito Range. Road cuts along the eastern approach to the pass reveal Pennsylvanian black shale and thin gray limestone layers that were laid down prior to the creation of the Ancestral Rockies. These Paleozoic layers were not uplifted during the creation of the Ancestral Rockies approximately 300 MYA and thus were not eroded to the same degree as other areas to the east and west.\n\nThe pass was traversed by the Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad in 1879, providing the first rail link between Denver and Leadville in the early days of the Colorado Silver Boom.

It also covers parts of the Bassetlaw and Rushcliffe areas including Markham Moor and Bingham.\n\nA parliamentary borough of the same name existed from 1673 to 1885, when it was replaced by a county division of the same name, the year of the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.\n\nNewark was the last borough to be added to the Unreformed House of Commons which took place in 1673, prior to the Reform Act 1832.

Quasimoto is composed of Madlib and his animated alter ego Lord Quas. Lord Quas is known for his high pitched voice, which often interacts with Madlib's regular voice. Quasimoto was conceived one day in the studio, when Madlib decided to rap to his own beats. Madlib did not like the sound of his voice (his friends in Oxnard call him 'Barry White' in reference to his deep voice) so he decided to slow his recorder down, rap slowly, then speed the recording back up to produce Lord Quas' distinctive high pitched sound. Quasimoto's lyrics frequently address themes such as violence and drug use in a comedic fashion, and the character of Lord Quas has frequently been interpreted as a satirical take on gangsta-rap. \n\nPeanut Butter Wolf, DJ and owner of Stones Throw Records, heard Quas' demo tapes and encouraged Madlib to release more tracks under this alias. Quasimoto was featured on Wolf's \"My Vinyl Weighs a Ton\" album in 1998, on the song \"Styles Crews Flows Beats.\" Later, Madlib put out Quasimoto's debut album - \"The Unseen\" - in 2000. This album received much praise from underground fans and from mainstream media, making it onto Spin Magazine's top albums of the year list.\n\nAfter the release of \"The Unseen\", Madlib spent the next few years working on different projects such as Yesterdays New Quintet and his album \"Shades of Blue\". Quas re-emerged in 2003, making a few guest appearances, notably on Jaylib's \"Champion Sound\" and Madvillain's \"Madvillainy\" (Madlib and MF DOOM). Quasimoto officially returned with the vinyl-only \"Bus Ride\" EP in 2005, continuing his distinctive style of high pitched rhymes and unorthodox samples.\n\nIn 2005, Quasimoto dropped \"The Further Adventures of Lord Quas\" which featured M.E.D. and MF DOOM. The album cover features a reference to Frank Zappa's debut album, \"Freak Out!\", a picture of super-producer J Dilla, and a picture of Wild Man Fischer, who is also referenced in one of the songs. The voice of Melvin Van Peebles is sampled on several tracks from both albums.\n\nQuasimoto released their third studio album entitled \"Yessir Whatever\" in June 2013, which is a compilation of several previously unreleased works. It collects 12-tracks made by Madlib and Quas over a roughly 12-year period. A few were released on rare and out-of-print vinyl, while a few others are previously unreleased, now mixed and mastered for the first time.\n\nIn an interview, Madlib said that the atmosphere and sound on the Quasimoto albums owe much to the work of Alain Goraguer on the soundtrack of \"La Planete Sauvage\". An early Quasimoto video features excerpts from the film, and the song \"Come On Feet\" contains a sample from its soundtrack.\n\n\n\n"}

This is a labeling for simple graphs in which no two distinct edges connect the same two distinct vertices, no edge connects a vertex to itself, and the graph is connected. Edge-graceful labelings were first introduced by Sheng-Ping Lo in his seminal paper.\n\nGiven a graph \"G\", we denote the set of edges by formula_1 and the vertices by formula_2. Let \"q\" be the cardinality of formula_1 and \"p\" be that of formula_2. Once a labeling of the edges is given, a vertex \"u\" of the graph is labeled by the sum of the labels of the edges incident to it, modulo \"p\". Or, in symbols, the induced labeling on the vertex \"u\" is given by\n\nwhere \"V\"(\"u\") is the label for the vertex and \"E\"(\"e\") is the assigned value of an edge incident to \"u\".\n\nThe problem is to find a labeling for the edges such that all the labels from 1 to \"q\" are used once and the induced labels on the vertices run from 0 to formula_6. In other words, the resulting set for labels of the edges should be formula_7 and formula_8 for the vertices.\n\nA graph \"G\" is said to be edge-graceful if it admits an edge-graceful labeling.\n\nConsider the cycle with three vertices, \"C\". This is simply a triangle. One can label the edges 1, 2, and 3, and check directly that, along with the induced labeling on the vertices, this gives an edge-graceful labeling. Similar to paths, formula_9 is edge-graceful when \"m\" is odd and not when \"m\" is even.\n\nConsider a path with two vertices, \"P\". Here the only possibility is to label the only edge in the graph 1. The induced labeling on the two vertices are both 1. So \"P\" is not edge-graceful.\n\nAppending an edge and a vertex to \"P\" gives \"P\", the path with three vertices. Denote the vertices by \"v\", \"v\", and \"v\". Label the two edges in the following way: the edge (\"v\", \"v\") is labeled 1 and (\"v\", \"v\") labeled 2. The induced labelings on \"v\", \"v\", and \"v\" are then 1, 0, and 2 respectively. This is an edge-graceful labeling and so \"P\" is edge-graceful.\n\nSimilarly, one can check that \"P\" is not edge-graceful.\n\nIn general, \"P\" is edge-graceful when \"m\" is odd and not edge-graceful when it is even. This follows from a necessary condition for edge-gracefulness.\n\nLo gave a necessary condition for a graph to be edge-graceful. It is that a graph with \"q\" edges and \"p\" vertices is edge graceful only if\n\nor, in symbols,\n\nThis is referred to as Lo's condition in the literature.

{"id": "1821481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821481", "title": "Symphony No. 4 (Tchaikovsky)", "text": "Symphony No. 4 (Tchaikovsky)\n\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 4 in F minor, Op. 36, was written between 1877 and 1878. Its first performance was at a Russian Musical Society concert in Moscow on February 22 (or the 10th using the calendar of the time), 1878, with Nikolai Rubinstein as conductor. In Middle Europe it sometimes receives the nickname \"Fatum\", or \"Fate\".\n\nDuring the composition of the symphony, Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, that he wanted \"very much\" to dedicate it to her, and that he would write on it \"Dedicated to My Best Friend\". He had begun composing the symphony not long after Meck had entered his life. He would complete it in the aftermath of his catastrophic marriage and claimed she would find in it \"an echo of your most intimate thoughts and emotions.\" The dedication was significant in more than one way. One important facet of the paternalistic nature of Russian society was that, in artistic patronage, patron and artist were considered equals. Dedications of works to patrons were not gestures of humble gratitude but expressions of artistic partnership. By dedicating the Fourth Symphony to her, he was affirming her as an equal partner in its creation.\n\nIt is also due to Madame von Meck that, at her request, Tchaikovsky wrote a program explaining the symphony. This action encouraged numerous writers to quote it instead of focusing on the symphony's purely musical qualities, including what Hans Keller termed \"one of the most towering symphonic structures in our whole literature\" in the opening movement. This program hindered acceptance of the symphony for many years, prejudicing Alfred Einstein and other musicologists against it. But this must be seen in the context of Einstein's general lack of sympathy for Tchaikovsky's music.\n\nBut despite this negative impact on the symphony's reception history, the composer's program gives one very telling clue regarding the work's musical architecture. Assertions to the effect that \"the first movement represents Fate\" are oversimplifications: according to a letter the composer wrote to Madame von Meck in 1878, it is actually the fanfare first heard at the opening (\"the kernel, the quintessence, the chief thought of the whole symphony\") that stands for \"Fate\", with this being \"the fatal power which prevents one from attaining the goal of happiness ... There is nothing to be done but to submit to it and lament in vain\". As the composer explained it, the programme of the first movement is—\"roughly\"—that \"all life is an unbroken alternation of hard reality with swiftly passing dreams and visions of happiness ...\". He went on: \"No haven exists ... Drift upon that sea until it engulfs and submerges you in its depths\".\n\nThe composer's description of the symphony's opening fanfare as a metaphor for \"Fate\" becomes more telling in the context of a letter he wrote Sergei Taneyev. He wrote Taneyev that the Fourth Symphony was both program music and a reflection of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in the central idea of its program. Keller has mentioned a parallel between the four-note motif which opens Beethoven's Fifth and the fanfare at the outset of Tchaikovsky's Fourth. Like Beethoven, Tchaikovsky uses his fanfare as a structural marker. Moreover, because of both the length and unorthodox form of the symphony, he may have felt using such a marker was a musical necessity.\n\nThe symphony is in four movements:\nThe symphony opens with horns and woodwinds, and trumpets join with a higher A. As the music solidifies into large, slow syncopated chords, Tchaikovsky unleashes the musical equivalent of lightning bolts: two short \"fortissimo\" chords, each followed by a long measure of silence. As the music ebbs away, the woodwinds hint at the main melody, which is properly introduced by the strings at the \"Moderato con anima\". (The score at this point is marked \"In movimento di Valse\", as it is written in .) The melody develops quite rapidly. Much later in the movement, the same A is played by the trumpets. This movement is marked by continual introductions of the fate motif, the A phrase. The motif serves as a separation between each section of the sonata—allegro form. At around twenty minutes in length in some performances, this is one of the longest symphonic movements by Tchaikovsky. It is also just short of the length of the remaining movements combined.\n\nThe second movement is introduced by the melancholy melody of the oboe. The music's impassioned climax is a reminder of the grieving phrases that dominated the opening movement.\n\nStrings play pizzicato throughout the third movement. They are joined by the woodwinds later when an oboe's long, high A signals the start of the A major Trio section. Later, the brass instruments come in, playing very quietly and staccato. The three groups (strings, woodwinds, and brass) are the only groups that play; there is no percussion in this movement except for the timpani, as in the previous movement. It ends quietly with pizzicato strings.\n\nIn the vigorous finale, Tchaikovsky incorporates a famous Russian folk song, \"In the Field Stood a Birch Tree\", as the secondary theme — firstly in A minor, the second time in B minor and then in D minor, which leads to the A phrase of the first movement, with the 'lightning bolts', with cymbals added, being much louder. The coda is also vigorous and triumphant.\n\nA typical performance has a duration of about 40 minutes.\n\nThe symphony is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, and strings.\n\nThe Fourth Symphony is where Tchaikovsky's struggles with Western sonata form came to a head. In some ways he was not alone. The Romantics in general were never natural symphonists because music was to them primarily evocative and biographical. Western musical form, as developed primarily by Germanic composers, was analytical and architectural; it simply was not designed to handle the personal emotions the Romantics wished to express. The difference with Tchaikovsky was that while the other Romantics remained generally autobiographical in what they wanted to express, he became more specific and, consequently, more intense.\n\nIn his first three symphonies he had striven to stay within strict Western form. The turbulent changes in his personal life, including his marital crisis, now led him to write music so strongly personal and expressive that structural matters could not stay as they had been. Beginning with the Fourth Symphony, the symphony served as a human document—dramatic, autobiographical, concerned not with everyday things but with things psychological. This was because Tchaikovsky's creative impulses had become unprecedentedly personal, urgent, capable of enormous expressive forcefulness, even violence.\n\nAlong with this emotional urgency came an unprecedented flow of melody. Here, Tchaikovsky developed his gift for tunefulness more freely and deployed it more liberally than he had previously. Paradoxically, this great asset also became his greatest enemy in terms of form. A melody is complete on its own terms. Because of this completeness, it stands apart from other themes meant not only to contrast, but more importantly to interact and build upon one another naturally. This dominance of one melody can ruin the balance and proportion Western classical composers considered the proper beauties of sonata form.\n\nThe combination of emotional urgency and supercharged melody precluded musical development not only because of the completeness of the melody, but also because the melody's emotional content was already in full bloom, with all the emotional and musical interest it could bear. Since musical development is a creative unfolding of the latent possibilities—rhythmic, melodic and harmonic—of contrasting themes, there was literally nothing to develop further. The only course of action left was to substitute repetition for true development—in other words, to say again in a different way what has already been said and to trust the beauty and significance of what are fundamentally variations to supply the place of a development section as demanded by sonata form.\n\nLike \"The Five,\" Tchaikovsky found that with a loose symphonic-poem type of structure pioneered by Franz Liszt, he could combine large-scale orchestral writing with emotions and instrumental colors toward which he gravitated naturally. The result was a symphonic hybrid, a cross between the primarily architectural form of the symphony and the primarily \"literary\" or \"poetic\" form of the symphonic poem. This is why he could write to Nadezhda von Meck, regarding the Fourth Symphony,\n\nThis hybrid form allowed Tchaikovsky to fall back on a structure that was basically a series of self-contained sections, emphasizing the contrast between these sections, however violent, while allowing the consequent drama to erupt in the context of one movement. This perhaps seemed only natural—many Russian folk songs are actually a series of variations on one basic shape or pattern of a few notes, so it was something with which Tchaikovsky was already familiar. The problem was that it did not solve the problem of inertia. The key of the music could change, but the music itself would basically repeat itself, remaining static in the Western sense of musical architecture.\n\nHowever, structure in Tchaikovsky's work became more than purely architecture. Melody, tonality, rhythm and orchestral timbres work together to form an indivisible whole. In the first movement of the Fourth Symphony, he introduces a highly rhythmic theme in the brass. The structure of this movement is made up of a complete series of rotating thirds, from F to A, B D and back to F, then a recapitulation to a third below the tonic. The brass theme delineates each stage of the structure. To heighten drama, he focuses mainly on rhythm, texture and orchestral color. The resulting tension in the first movement does not come from a Germanic transformation of themes. It results from rhythmic opposition between the polonaise rhythm of the aggressive \"Fate\" motif in the brass and the gentler waltz of the first theme, carried alternately by woodwinds and strings.\n\nThe finale of this symphony is generally judged by its success in rounding off the symphonic cycle into a cohesive whole. Tchaikovsky here repeats the \"Fate\" motif which opened the piece. However, it could be said to appeal to the patriotic and heroic feelings of his aristocratic listeners. This would place it in line with the finales of Tchaikovsky's three earlier symphonies as an apotheosis in Imperial style.\n\nInitial critical reaction to the work was unfavorable. Tchaikovsky was in Florence, Italy when the symphony was premiered and received word only from von Meck at first. His closest friends were so unsure about parts of the work that they did not say anything to him. A telegram from Rubinstein and the other musicians involved in the performances assured him only that the symphony had been well played. After a month, the composer wrote to Sergei Taneyev. Taneyev replied promptly and, as per his nature, all too honestly. Taneyev had found the symphony excellent in parts but less impressive overall. While he admired the first movement, he also considered it overlong. This, he thought, gave the work as a whole the feeling of a symphonic poem with three additional movements attached to justify it being called a symphony. Rubinstein had liked the finale best. Tchaikovsky replied defensively to Taneyev but was appreciative of his candor. He also suspected—rightly, it turned out—that Taneyev was hiding the news of a lukewarm reception to the premiere. At its St. Petersburg premiere the following November, the symphony was better received.\n\nReaction to the premiere in the United States was also negative. In 1890 a reviewer for the \"New York Post\" wrote, \"The Fourth Tchaikovsky Symphony proved to be one of the most thoroughly Russian, i.e. semi-barbaric, compositions ever heard in the city. ... If Tchaikovsky had called his symphony 'A Sleigh Ride Through Siberia' no one would have found this title inappropriate.\"\n\nThe British premiere was in June 1893, conducted by the composer, who was attending Cambridge University to receive an honorary doctorate, along with Camille Saint-Saëns, Max Bruch and Arrigo Boito (Edvard Grieg was also honoured, but was unable to attend in person). The hall was filled to capacity, and the symphony received great applause after each movement.\n\nA reviewer in Germany in 1897 wrote \"The composer's twaddle disturbed my mood. The confusion in brass and the abuse of the kettledrums drove me away!\"\n\nIn spite of its early critical reviews, the symphony has become a staple of the orchestral repertoire, and remains one of the most frequently performed symphonies of the late 19th century. It is also ranked as one of the best of Tchaikovsky's symphonies.\n\nAt least 200 commercial recordings exist of this symphony, including:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The seat was created in 1997 and has always been represented by Members of Parliament (MPs) from the Conservative Party; like all British constituencies, it elects one candidate by the first-past-the-post voting system. Johnson became the MP for the constituency after a by-election in December 2016, following the resignation of the previous MP for the seat, Stephen Phillips. The constituency is considered a safe seat for the Conservatives.\n\n1997–2010: The District of North Kesteven except for the ward of Bracebridge Heath, and the District of South Kesteven wards of Ermine, Heath, Loveden, Saxonwell, and Witham Valley.\n\n2010–present: The District of North Kesteven wards of Ashby de la Launde, Bassingham, Billinghay, Branston and Mere, Brant Broughton, Cliff Villages, Cranwell and Byard’s Leap, Eagle and North Scarle, Heckington Rural, Heighington and Washingborough, Kyme, Leasingham and Roxholm, Martin, Metheringham, North Hykeham Forum, North Hykeham Memorial, North Hykeham Mill, North Hykeham Moor, North Hykeham Witham, Osbournby, Ruskington, Sleaford Castle, Sleaford Holdingham, Sleaford Mareham, Sleaford Navigation, Sleaford Quarrington, Sleaford Westholme, and Waddington West, and the District of South Kesteven wards of Barrowby, Ermine, Heath, Loveden, Peascliffe, Saxonwell, and Witham Valley.\n\nThe constituency covers the towns of Sleaford and North Hykeham and a large area of rural Lincolnshire south west of Lindsey. The constituency's boundaries roughly correspond to those of North Kesteven local government district. In their formative proposals for 1997, the Boundary Commission for England proposed calling the new constituency Mid Lincolnshire, however the name was changed to its current form during the local inquiry process. The inclusion of North Hykeham in the constituency title was criticised by the author and psephologist Robert Waller in 1995, on the grounds that North Hykeham was effectively an overspill area of the City of Lincoln; however, not on the grounds of its actual inclusion, as its local government authority has long been seen as linked with the villages to the south in this seat, and wholly separate from the city.\n\nFollowing another Boundary Commission review, the constituency boundaries with two of its neighbouring seats Lincoln and Grantham and Stamford were changed for the 2010 general election.\n\nThe areas within the constituency of Sleaford and North Hykeham are under the control and come under the responsibility of Lincolnshire County Council for the provision of certain public services, such as roads and local authority education.\n\nDouglas Hogg moved to represent Sleaford and North Hykeham from the previously existing Grantham constituency, a safe Conservative seat which he had held since 1979. At the 1997 general election, Hogg won 43.9% of the vote, giving him a majority of 5,123 votes (9.6%) ahead of the second-placed Labour Party. At the 2001 general election, the Conservatives increased their vote share by 5.7%, while the Labour Party's vote share decreased; the seat had a majority of 8,622 votes (17.7%), which was the 104th-smallest percentage majority out of the 166 seats won by the Conservatives. At the 2005 general election, Hogg won a majority of 12,705 votes (23.8%); this was the 35th-largest absolute majority (number of votes) and 52nd-largest percentage majority of the 198 seats won by the Conservative Party. UKIP, a minor party, won 5% of the vote in the constituency (coming fourth), retaining its deposit. He stood down at the 2010 general election owing to controversy over his expenses claims, making him the first MP to resign because of the scandal. \n\nHogg was replaced by fellow Conservative Stephen Phillips. In 2010, he won a majority of 19,905 votes (33.4%); the Liberal Democrats came second. Out of the 650 UK Parliament constituencies contested at the election, Sleaford and North Hykeham had the 14th-largest absolute majority and the 72nd-largest percentage majority. The Lincolnshire Independents, a minor party, won 6.4% of the vote in the seat and came fourth; as this was more than 5%, the party retained its deposit. At the 2015 general election, Phillips won a majority of 24,115 votes (38.9%), with the Labour Party coming second in the seat. This made the constituency the 34th-safest by absolute majority, and the 99th-safest by percentage majority, out of the 650 constituencies.\n\nPhillips stood down as an MP on 4 November 2016, owing to \"irreconcilable differences\" with the Government over the issue of Brexit. This triggered a by-election within the constituency, which was held on 8 December; Caroline Johnson retained the seat for the Conservatives with a large majority.\n\nAt the 2017 general election, Johnson won a majority of 25,237 votes; this was the second-largest majority of any seat in the East Midlands region (after Leicester South. Johnson's 42,245 votes were the greatest tally for her party in that election. The majority in percentage was surpassed by six candidates of the same party. At the 2019 general election, the Conservatives increased their majority to further to 32,565. This was the largest Conservative majority (measured by number of votes) at the election, and the largest majority of any seat in the East Midlands.\nThe seat is overweight in electorate meaning each elector's potential vote counts for about 15% less than the smallest mainland seats and each potential vote has 24.4% of the potential effect as the remote seat covering Na h-Eileanan an Iar (the Western Isles or Outer Hebrides).

The novel draws on Slavic folklore and concerns the fate of a girl who has drowned and becomes a rusalka. It is also an exploration of magic and the development of a young wizard.\n\n\"Rusalka\" was nominated for the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 1990 and was a third-place runner-up.\n\nCherryh self-published a revised edition of \"Rusalka\" in e-book format in October 2010 at Closed Circle Publications.\n\nSasha is a 15-year-old downtrodden stable boy living with his aunt and uncle at an inn they run in the town of Vojvoda. Sasha's parents had been killed in a house fire that he was accused of starting through wizardry. Pyetr is one of the town's audacious young men, and one day he is attacked and wounded by old Yurishev for having a liaison with his young wife. Pyetr escapes, but later learns that Yurishev is dead, and that he has been accused of murdering him by sorcery. Pyetr hides in the stables at the inn, and Sasha helps him leave the town. With no future for himself in Vojvoda, Sasha accompanies the wounded Pyetr.\n\nPyetr and Sasha walk for days through fields and into a dead forest. Sasha does not believe he is a wizard, but finds he sometimes has the ability to successfully wish for things. Pyetr does not believe in wizards at all, and laughs at Sasha's wishing. Exhausted and without food, the pair find a cottage by a river. Its occupant, a wizard named Uulamets, heals Pyetr and agrees to let them stay on condition that they help him find his daughter, Eveshka, who had drowned when she was 16 and is now a rusalka. Pyetr is suspicious of Uulamets and does not believe in rusalkas. Later, while the three of them are searching for Eveshka, she makes herself visible to Pyetr, overpowers him, and leads him into the forest. Rusalkas are renowned for drowning men they have chosen, but Eveshka abandons Pyetr and disappears again. Uulamets and Sasha find Pyetr unharmed, but are attacked by Hwiuur, a shapeshifting vodyanoi, known to drown people who go too close to the water.\n\nUulamets traps Hwiuur and threatens to kill it. The creature pleads for its life and admits to drowning Eveshka, but blames Chernevog, a former student of Uulamets. Eveshka had fallen in love with Chernevog and run off with him, but Chernevog had used his newly acquired wizardry to control her, and then handed her over to Hwiuur. Even as a rusalka Chernevog still controls Eveshka and will not let her return to her father. Uulamets agrees to let Hwiuur go on condition that he helps them find Chernevog.\n\nWhile searching for Chernevog, Pyetr spots Eveshka and chases after her. Sasha wants to follow Pyetr to protect him, but Uulamets wills Sasha to stay. Uulamets had recognised Sasha's potential for wizardry and taught him how to use his talents, but stressed the dangers of unchecked wishing and the importance of considering their consequences first. Pyetr, who now has feelings for Eveshka, and is slowly accepting this new world of wizards, rusalkas and river creatures, finds her and together they locate Chernevog's house in the forest. Chernevog immediately takes control of Pyetr and instructs Hwiuur to guard him. As Uulamets and Sasha approach the house Chernevog starts sending lightning bolts at them, but Uulamets is able to redirect them back at the house, setting it ablaze. In the chaos, Pyetr breaks free of Hwiuur and overpowers a weakened Chernevog. Uulamets then casts a wizard's once-in-a-lifetime spell and commands Eveshka to \"live!\". This final wish kills the wizard but resurrects Eveshka. Sasha discovers that that spell also bestowed on him all of the wizard's knowledge and abilities.\n\nChernevog is unconscious, but Sasha cannot kill him and instead puts him into a long, deep sleep. Hwiuur has disappeared, and leshys, woodland spirits, appear and celebrate the downfall of Chernevog. They put him on a stone in a circle of trees and agree to guard him. With Eveshka flesh and bone again, she and Pyetr finally unite, and Sasha, now a wizard, has new responsibilities to attend to.\n\nIn a review in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", science fiction and fantasy writer Roland J.

{"id": "1821528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821528", "title": "Stupid Dream", "text": "Stupid Dream\n\nStupid Dream is the fifth studio album by British progressive rock band Porcupine Tree. It was first released in March 1999, and then re-released on 15 May 2006 due to the band's rising popularity on major record label Lava Records with their releases of \"In Absentia\" in 2002 and \"Deadwing\" in 2005. The album, along with \"Lightbulb Sun\" in 2000, represented a transitional period for the band, moving away from the band's earlier work in instrumental and psychedelic music, but before they took a more metal direction in 2002 onwards. The album takes a commercially accessible pop rock sound while still retaining heavy progressive rock influences.\n\nThe album's title is a reference to frontman Steven Wilson's view of the music industry; while many aspire to be a musician for fame and glamorous lifestyle, he feels it's a \"stupid dream\" because it actually leads to a life of hard work and struggle.\n\nFrontman Steven Wilson explained the transitional period for the band at the time, stating:\n\nWilson said that the album marked a transition away from \"abstract instrumentality\" into more \"natural songwriting\" also was due to the influence of the music he had been listening to since the release of their last album, \"Signify\" in 1996. These artists included Jeff Buckley, Soundgarden, Brian Wilson, Todd Rundgren, and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.\n\nThe album was recorded at Foel Studios in Llanfair Caerinon, Wales, and at No Man's Land Studios at Hemel Hempstead, England. Wilson stated that it was the first time that the band sat down and recorded a whole album in one extended period, rather than sporadically as with past albums. He contends that this helped the band \"experiment and collaborate on a cohesive sound for the album\" and that the album \"contains our most vertically complex music, as opposed to horizontally complex (whereby the tracks comprise simple sections, but many of them strung together). Here the songs are relatively tightly structured but much more layered than anything we had attempted before.\" The band also had a much larger budget than in the past; the album production cost £15,000, compared to only £2,000 for their previous album \"Signify\".<ref name=\"Porcupine Tree Review/Interview\"></ref> This enabled them to bring in an orchestra to record parts for the album. Strings were arranged by Chris Thorpe and Wilson and performed by the East of England Orchestra.\n\nKeyboardist Richard Barbieri took a different approach to the album's recording as well: A much more sophisticated sound and meticulous attention to detail defines my approach on this album. Steven came up with a strong selection of songs and a long process followed during which we attempted to condense as many ideas, flavours and colours into the arrangements as possible. Orchestra, flute and saxophone added further to the eclectic mix and I also feel that we started to focus more of what each other was contributing. Nearly all my work was completed within an intense 7 day session in Wales. Before the sessions we had decided that the keyboards used would be analogue only. Much of my work was spontaneous performance recorded onto hard disk, which allowed me to adopt an approach whereby multiple takes and parts could be recorded and edited and compiled later on - a much more creative way of working than always looking for the one \"perfect\" take. But the other side to the recording was getting the pre-written parts worked out and played as well as possible, things like the mellotron and Hammond organ parts.\n\nThe album was finished in late 1998 and released in March 1999. The band's next album, \"Lightbulb Sun\", was recorded so closely after the \"Stupid Dream\" sessions that Wilson later reflected that they sounded like \"two parts of a double record\". Songs from these sessions that were ultimately left off both albums were later compiled onto the b-side album \"Recordings\" in 2001.\n\nThe lyrics of the album were much more personal to Wilson than they had been in previous Porcupine Tree albums. Wilson said the album deals with his own personal \"insecurities and feelings\" and \"the usual singer-songwriter stuff\", because he believed the most relatable and affecting lyrics were from a personal point of view. Much of the personal lyrics are also in regards to his relationship and views on the music industry:\n\nThe album cover photography, taken by Robert Harding, is linked to the album's concept as well. Wilson stated:\n\nThree singles were released from the album: \"Piano Lessons\", \"Stranger by the Minute\", and \"Pure Narcotic\". \"Piano Lessons\" was the first single for the album and was released just a week prior to the album's release. A music video was made in which band members used signs referencing ironic marketing terminology, related to the album's concept of being part of the music industry as a \"stupid dream\". \"Stranger by the Minute\" was the second single from the album. The song itself features a harmonization in the chorus, between Wilson and drummer Chris Maitland, his only vocal performance on the whole album. Wilson also plays the bass on the song, instead of bassist Colin Edwin. \"Pure Narcotic\" was the third and final single from the album. This track features acoustic guitars, close harmony vocals, glockenspiel, pastoral piano and lyrics. The lyrics make a reference to Radiohead's album \"The Bends\": \"You keep me hating, You keep me listening to 'The Bends'.\"\n\n\"Even Less\" was originally 17 minutes long, but Wilson decided to only use the first 7 minutes for the \"Stupid Dream\" album version. A separate, second 7-minute section of the song was released on the CD single of \"Stranger by the Minute\", and a combined version of 14 minutes in length was later released on their 2001 \"Recordings\" compilation album. Additionally, a 15-minute demo version of the song with alternate lyrics can only be found in the special edition of the \"Four Chords That Made a Million\" single. At the end of the track a woman can be heard repeating the pattern of numbers: \"0096 2251 2110 8105\". About these numbers, Wilson stated: \"The counting in 'Even Less' is taken from a recording of a shortwave numbers station. It is understood that these stations are used by intelligence agencies to transmit coded messages to overseas operatives, although no government agency has ever acknowledged the existence of these stations or what their actual purpose might be. They are virtually impossible to decode without the key since the message and its key are generated at random.\"\n\nThe song \"Stupid Dream\" is actually only a short, 28 second instrumental piece of a tuning orchestra and sound effects. \"Slave Called Shiver\", and \"Don't Hate Me\", according to Wilson, are about feelings of \"unreturned love\". He said of them, \"[A Slave Called Shiver]'s a very perverse love song, yeah. I mean, it's an unrequited love song. It's a love song with somebody who's obsessed with someone else, but none of that affection is returned. It relates very closely to 'Don't Hate Me', which is a song again about someone who's obsessed with someone from afar. 'Don't Hate Me' is an even more extreme version, because here this person actually begins to follow and make phone calls and, you know, it becomes very unhealthy. 'Slave Called Shiver' is slightly less extreme. It's about someone who's very much in love and obsessed with somebody else. That love is not returned and so there's a slightly violent perverse undercurrent. 'Pure Narcotic' also is very much the same subject\". \"Don't Hate Me\" featured the first use of saxophone in the music of Porcupine Tree, courtesy of Theo Travis. During live performances, the flute and saxophone solos are replaced by Barbieri's keyboard and Wilson guitar solos respectively.\n\n\"This Is No Rehearsal\" has been described as a mixture of \"semi-acoustic segments with desperate vocals and heavy metal raves\". Wilson said it \"...was directly inspired by a tragic UK event a few years ago. A child was taken from a shopping mall while his mother was momentarily distracted and was later found dead and tortured near a railway track. The most disturbing thing about the story was that the two abductors/murderers turned out to be children themselves.\"\n\n\"Baby Dream in Cellophane\" is a short psychedelic track. Colin Edwin does not appear in this track, Wilson plays the bass instead. Wilson has said of the song, \"The baby in the song is basically singing the song: 'I am in my pram'. And it's quite a cynical song because he's basically saying that the boy's life is almost mapped out already as the child is born, it's already predetermined by society and the baby's kind of singing from the pram if you like, saying 'well, actually no, I'm not going to go down this path that's been laid out for me. I'm gonna break out.' It's almost like a very surreal teen rebellion song.\"\n\nIn \"A Smart Kid\" Wilson returns to a topic he has touched on before in \"Radioactive Toy\", a track from their first album, \"On the Sunday of Life...\". The lyrics deal with a sole survivor after a possible apocalyptic war that gets picked up by an exploring spaceship.\n\n\"Tinto Brass\" is the only song on the album credited to the whole band, not just Wilson, and was named after Italian director Tinto Brass. The track is an instrumental, with the exception of a spoken word part. Regarding that part of the song, Wilson said: \"Oh, yes, it's spoken in Japanese! It's my girlfriend who's Japanese and she's got a film book. I tell you it's so difficult to find anything on Tinto Brass in England. He's completely unknown... And then my girlfriend... found this little biography: where he was born, the films he made. So she said, 'well, should I translate that for you?' (because I wanted it to be spoken in the track) and I said 'No, it's great' — I thought — 'I'll have it in Japanese'. So she just read it in Japanese. But it's just a list of his films and where he's from... It's nothing interesting\".\n\nThe album is closed with the track \"Stop Swimming\". Wilson said of its meaning, \"I found that when I was writing the music for this album a lot of the songs were about me and my relationship with the music industry and how I felt about where I was going in the music business and all that. Things like 'Stop Swimming'... maybe it's time to stop swimming... and this kind of whole impulse to just give up and go with the flow can be very strong sometimes. I mean I've never given into it. I never will.\" Additionally, from the \"Warszawa\" live album liner notes, he said, \"This is a very sad song, but if you're like me, I always find the saddest music is also the most beautiful and this is one of my favorite songs that I've ever written\"\n\nReception for the album has been generally positive. \"Billboard\" praised the album, saying it contained some of Wilson's best lyrics, and favorably compared the album to the work of the band Radiohead. Allmusic praised the songwriting and dynamics of the album, stating \"Wilson as a songwriter and singer both sounds recharged and more ambitious, while the group collectively pours it on. The loud passages feel truly sky-smashing, the calmer ones perfectly close, and the overall sense of build and drama -- \"A Smart Kid\" is a fine example—spot-on.\" The \"Dutch Progressive Rock Page\" was mostly positive as well, concluding \"People who love The Tree for their long, experimental and instrumental compositions might be put off by this new album. On the other hand, those who preferred the vocal tracks will probably find a lot of beauties on this new CD...Still a brilliant piece of work though.\" In 2005, \"Stupid Dream\" was ranked number 339 in \"Rock Hard\" magazine's book of \"The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time\".\n\nIn October 2011, it was awarded a gold certification from the Independent Music Companies Association (IMPALA), which indicated sales in excess of 75,000 copies throughout Europe.\n\nAll songs written by Steven Wilson, except \"Tinto Brass\", which is credited to all four band members.\nThe re-release was in the form as both a 2 disc CD/DVD-A set, and double vinyl LP. The double vinyl LP was only available through the band's official store, Burning Shed. The CD contains a new mix of the album by Wilson, and the DVD-A contains a 5.1 surround mix, the video for \"Piano Lessons\", and two bonus tracks, the full 14 minute version of \"Even Less\", and \"Ambulance Chasing\", both previously released on \"Recordings\" in 2001. The Korean edition of \"Stupid Dream\" included the \"Piano Lessons\" video as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Water of Leith is also to the west.\n\nThe name is first recorded in 1278 as \"Crag quam Stephanus Loccard miles tenuit\", thus \"Craig (or rock) of Loccard\". The family, whose name was changed to Lockhart, are credited by Historic Scotland with building Craiglockhart Castle in the fifteenth century.\n\nThe oldest \"structure\" in the area is the remains of a vitrified fort on the top of Wester Craiglockhart Hill, which is of prehistoric origin. This was somewhat mutilated by the addition of gun-emplacements in World War II, guarding against aerial attack. Excavations show the fort was re-occupied during Roman times. Craiglockhart Castle dates from the 15th century but is now ruined. The hill is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to its diverse biological habitat.\n\nIn Victorian times the area was dominated by hospital buildings: The City Hospital (1896); Old Craig House (1565) converted to an asylum in 1878; its \"modern\" partner, Craighouse, purpose-built as part of the Royal Edinburgh Asylum (1889); the City Poorhouse (1867) later converted to Greenlea's Old People's Home; and Craiglockhart Hydropathic Institution, and in the years 1871-1982 this building rose dramatically above and directly overlooked the home playing grounds of Edinburgh University RFC. Craighouse and The Hydropathic are now part of the campus of Edinburgh Napier University. During the First World War, the hospital was used to house officers suffering from the symptoms of shell-shock. Invalids here included the poets Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon, who met while patients. After the war this the building served as a convent and then a theological school, before passing to the then Napier College.\nThe area became part of Edinburgh City in 1920 and consequently the area was developed in the 1930s, largely with bungalows and low density housing on the low-lying ground around the Wester and Easter Craiglockhart Hills. \n\nApproximately at the boundary point between Craiglockhart and Merchiston runs the Edinburgh Suburban railway line. There was once a station just off Colinton Road, and this may return, since the line is mooted for re-opening as part of Edinburgh's future transport strategy.\n\nCraiglockhart today is chiefly residential, with a small proportion of commercial properties, and is in general considered to be a comfortable middle-class area, with a mixture of terraced and detached villas, of a variety of ages.\n\nCraiglockhart Tennis Centre plays host to large international tennis competitions, with a series of well kept indoor and outdoor courts. One famous product of the centre is Andy Murray, who often trained there. On the same ground is Craiglockhart Sport And Leisure Centre which has a small boating pond (built as a curling pond in 1878).\n\nA small cluster of commercial premises remain close to the station site, with a further group located opposite the Craiglockhart Tennis Centre. A small Tesco \"Express\" supermarket has been built on the site of a former petrol station adjacent to the Meggetland playing fields. The opening of this branch of Tesco was vociferously opposed by the Scottish food writer Joanna Blythman, who claimed that opening the store would damage the local grocery store at Happy Valley.\n\nThere is a Craiglockhart Primary School, although this is a little to the north of Craiglockhart itself, technically within North Merchiston (though commonly described as within Polwarth or Shandon.)\n\n"}
{"id": "1821541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821541", "title": "Flag of Bohemia", "text": "Flag of Bohemia\n\nThe flag of Bohemia is a historic flag, which now forms part of the design in the modern flag of the Czech Republic. The flag, a horizontal bicolour, was based on the colours of the former monarchs of Bohemia.\n\nThe heraldic flag of Bohemia (the flag of Bohemia in the form of the flag with coat of arms) is described and drawn for example in the work of Jacob Koebel: \"Wapen des heyligen römischen Reichs teutscher Nation\" from 1545. The even older description of this flag (13th century) can be read in the chronicle of Ottokar aus der Gaal (Otacher ouz der Geul, Ottokar von Steiermark) (* about 1265; † between 1318 and 1322): \"Die Steirische Reimchronik\".\n\n\"The colors of the flag, white and red, were derived from the coat of arms of the King of Bohemia (silver lion on a red field) which was granted to the king Vladislaus I in the 12th century. This quickly became the coat of arm of the whole kingdom.\"\n\nThe oldest surviving full colour depiction of the arms of Bohemia is represented by the fresco in the hall of the castle of Gozzoburg in Krems an der Donau, that comes from the early 1270s. A further depiction can be found in the manuscript of abbes Kunigunde from the 1310s.\n\nThe bicolor white-red banners were therefore carried into battle by the armies of the Bohemian kings and in the 19th century the colors were adopted by the Czech national movement. But when the goals of the movement were fulfilled in 1918 by the restoration of the independent Czech state, the need for the significant symbols, including a flag which was not identical to that of neighbouring Poland, led to the approval of the new flag of Czechoslovakia in 1920. This new flag still included the white and red horizontal stripes from the flag of Bohemia.\n\nIn 1990, the Bohemian flag was adopted as the official flag of the Czech Republic, then part of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic (ČSFR, 1990–1992). The flag was adopted in reaction to the adoption of separate Slovak symbols. However, the Czech flag was used much less than the wider flag of Czechoslovakia, whereas the flag of Slovakia (then without coat of arms and thus identical to flag of the World War II Slovak Republic) was widely used in Slovakia. This difference mirrored prevailing separatist tendencies in the Slovak Republic and federalist tendencies in the Czech Republic. Another problem, again, was the Bohemian flag's similarity to the flag of neighbouring Poland, because the only difference was the proportion 2:3 (Polish flag is 5:8). For these reasons, Czech politicians decided to preserve the flag of Czechoslovakia as the symbol of the state with which most of Czech society was identified.\n\nSince 1993, the flag of Bohemia has had no legal status and is only rarely seen today in the Czech Republic.\n\n\n"}

He then attended Grand Canyon University, Cochise College, and Yavapai College, playing baseball at all three colleges.\n\nCurtis was drafted in the 45th round of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft by the California Angels, the 1,155th player chosen.\n\nHe made his major-league debut in 1992, playing in 139 games at all three outfield positions. He compiled a .259 average with 10 home runs and 46 runs batted in, also stealing 43 bases, but was thrown out 18 times (2nd in the American League).\n\nIn 1993, Curtis hit .285 with 6 home runs and 59 runs batted in, but led the league with 24 times caught stealing. He also led all AL outfielders in errors, with nine. In the strike-shortened 1994 season, Curtis played in 114 games, batting .256 while hitting 11 home runs with 50 runs batted in. During the season, Curtis had an argument with batting instructor Rod Carew, after which Carew said Curtis was selfish and \"uncoachable.\" In the off-season, Curtis had a shouting match with General Manager Bill Bavasi about Curtis's contract.\n\nOn April 13, 1995, the 26-year-old Curtis was traded to the Detroit Tigers for 36-year-old utility player Tony Phillips.\n\nDuring his first season as a Tiger, Curtis hit .268 with 21 homers and 67 runs batted in, while leading the American League with 670 plate appearances. In 1996, Curtis played in 104 games, hitting .263 with 10 home runs and 37 runs batted in. The Tigers, who had planned on releasing Curtis at the end of the season, traded him to the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 31, 1996, for relief pitchers John Cummings and Joey Eischen.\n\nCurtis played in 43 games with the Dodgers, hitting just .212 with only 9 runs batted in. During the 1996 postseason, Curtis was 0-for-3 in his only game played. That season his salary was $2 million. On October 15, 1996, he became a free agent.\n\nCurtis signed with the Indians on December 18, 1996. In 1997, Curtis played in only 22 games for the Indians, hitting .207 (6-for-29) with three home runs and five runs batted in.\n\nIn May 1997, after Curtis objected to lyrics of a rap song teammate Kevin Mitchell was playing in the clubhouse, and shut off the clubhouse stereo, he exchanged punches with Mitchell, who threw him over a ping pong table. Curtis sustained a bruised right thumb in the fight, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list.\n\nThe Indians traded Curtis to the Yankees on June 9, 1997, for pitcher David Weathers.\n\nIn 1997 with the Yankees, Curtis hit .291 with 12 home runs and 50 runs batted in. In the postseason he went 1-for-6 with 3 walks and 1 strikeout. In 1998, Curtis hit .243 with 10 home runs and 56 runs batted in during the Yankees' 114-win regular season. In the 1998 American League Division Series, Curtis was 2-for-3 with a run scored and a stolen base. In the 1998 AL Championship Series, he was 0-for-4 with a walk and a strikeout. He did not play in the 1998 World Series, but still received a World Series ring.\n\nIn 1999, Curtis played in just 99 games, hitting .262 with five home runs and 24 runs batted in. In the 1999 American League Division Series Curtis played in all three games, and scored one run despite not recording any hits. In the 1999 American League Championship Series, he scored a run and stole a base, again without recording a hit.\n\nCurtis played all four games of the 1999 World Series in left field. He is best known for hitting a walk-off home run in Game 3 of the series against the Atlanta Braves; it was his second home run of the game. When, immediately following the home run, NBC sportscaster Jim Gray sought to conduct an on-field interview with Curtis, Curtis refused to talk with him. He indicated that this was in response to Gray's earlier, pointed interview on gambling with Pete Rose, a former baseball player who had been banned from involvement with MLB because of his gambling history. Curtis told Gray: \"I can't do it. As a team, we kind of decided, because of what happened with Pete, we're not going to talk out here on the field\". Then-Yankees manager Joe Torre later said there was no such unified effort to snub Gray from either Yankees players or front office staff, and that Curtis had acted alone.\n\nDuring Curtis' playing time in New York he was known \"more for his aggressive proselytizing and capacity for moral reprobation than anything he did on the field\". He publicly scolded his teammate Derek Jeter, in front of teammates and reporters both near the dugout and at Jeter's locker in the clubhouse, for fraternizing with then-Seattle Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez during an on-field fracas between the two teams, telling Jeter he did not know how to play the game. He also persistently solicited Jeter to attend chapel, after Jeter had already declined. Curtis said: \"If I have something that I believe is the truth and it's necessary for other people to come to some type of a recognition or grip of that truth, then I want to share it.\"\n\nOn December 13, 1999, the Yankees traded Curtis to the Texas Rangers for pitchers Brandon Knight and Sam Marsonek. A Yankee official said: \"Chad just couldn't stay around any longer because that act gets tired. Once he became comfortable here, he became a preacher, and it ran its course.\"\n\nDuring the 2000 season, Curtis became the first right-handed batter to hit a home run into the upper deck in right field at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. Curtis played in 108 games that year, hitting .272 with 8 home runs and 48 runs batted in. He was second in the AL among left fielders in errors, with five. That season his salary was $2 million.\n\nIn April 2000 Curtis had a heated confrontation in the clubhouse weight room with teammate Royce Clayton that nearly came to blows, after Curtis insisted on turning off rap music that Clayton was playing whose lyrics Curtis objected to. Curtis also turned off a television show in the clubhouse that he disapproved of his teammates watching. During that season he also told outfielder Gabe Kapler, his Jewish teammate, that Kapler was going to hell if he didn't believe that Jesus Christ was his lord and savior.\n\nIn 2001, he hit .252 with 3 home runs and 10 runs batted in just 38 games. That season he earned $1.9 million. On November 5, 2001, Curtis was granted free agency. He retired from professional baseball after the 2001 season.\n\nCurtis married his college sweetheart, the former Candace Reynolds, in 1990 and the since divorced couple has six children. He views himself as a \"Bible-believing Christian\", and says he never drinks alcohol and never swears, quoting from the New Testament (Colossians 3:8), and says he has never cheated on his wife. As a major league baseball player, he chastised teammates for missing chapel, listening to explicit rap, or watching \"The Jerry Springer Show\" on television.\n\nAfter retiring from Major League Baseball, Curtis earned a teaching certificate at the evangelical Cornerstone University in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nCurtis then worked for two years as a physical education teacher and coach at Caledonia High School, outside of Grand Rapids.\n\nStarting in the fall of 2006, he was employed as the athletic director and weight training instructor at NorthPointe Christian High School in Grand Rapids, a fundamentalist Baptist school. He helped construct a weight room at the school. He was fired without public explanation, in the late fall of 2009.\n\nDuring the 2010-11 school year, Curtis began substitute teaching and volunteering in the Lakewood High School weight room. Along with coaching youth baseball, in 2011 Curtis coached the Lakewood Public Schools equestrian team, which included two of his daughters, with the team winning state Division D championship honors that same year. Curtis also worked as a substitute teacher, high school weight-training coach, and head coach of the high school varsity football team.\n\nIn May 2012, after several female students accused him of \"inappropriate touching\", Curtis resigned from his positions at Lakewood Public Schools. In June 2012, Curtis was ordered to stand trial for five counts of criminal sexual conduct ranging from misdemeanors to felonies carrying a potential 15-year sentence. In August 2012, Curtis was charged with an additional, sixth count of criminal sexual conduct.\n\nCurtis's criminal trial began on August 12, 2013, during which three of his victims and two others, all underage girls, testified. Curtis according to testimony offered massages to some of the girl athletes at the school, but not to any of the boys. Curtis was accused of touching the buttocks and breasts of and molesting two 15-year-old girls in 2012 when he was a volunteer weight-room strength trainer at Lakewood High School in Lake Odessa, Michigan, and touching, fondling, kissing the breast of, and sexually penetrating with his finger a 16-year-old girl in 2011 (he said it was the \"most unfaithful he's ever been to [his] wife\".). He gave the massages first in the school's weight room, then in a room next to the weight room, and ultimately in a windowless trainer's room.\n\nOn August 16 Curtis was found guilty on all six counts, including third-degree criminal sexual conduct, a crime that involves sexual penetration. In an hour-long address to the court, Curtis accused all his victims of lying, spoke of how he decided to become a servant of God while playing for Detroit, spoke of the people he brought to Christ through his example, and said that he was the one rebuffing advances from the girls. The Barry County, Michigan Prosecutor Julie Nakfoor Pratt later stated that Curtis' sentencing statement \"was the most selfish, self-serving, victim-blaming statement I've heard in my career as a prosecutor. ... It speaks volumes about his character, or lack thereof.\"\n\nOn October 3, 2013, Curtis was sentenced by Barry County Circuit Court Judge Amy McDowell to 7 to 15 years in prison. In February 2015, Curtis's criminal convictions were upheld by the Michigan state appeals court, in a 3–0 decision. After pursuing an attempt in March 2016 for re-sentencing, Curtis later withdrew the request when the presiding judge signaled that Curtis faced the possibility of a longer term of incarceration.\n\nAfter Curtis's conviction, his former teammate Gabe Kapler wrote:\n\nI'm floored that I misjudged the character of a man so horribly. Perhaps I was blinded with the mantle of righteous moral authority he always tried to wear and never looked deeper. ... Chad Curtis wasn't the first major leaguer to commit a heinous crime. I'm confident in my assessment, however, that he'll represent the last time that I allow the veil of religion and perceived moral high ground to impede my better judgment of another human being's fiber.\n\nCurtis was incarcerated at the Gus Harrison Correctional Facility in Adrian, Michigan. He will be eligible for parole on September 13, 2020.\n\nIn a 2014 federal civil lawsuit filed against Curtis by his three victims in the criminal sexual conduct case plus a fourth Lakewood High School student accuser with similar claims, Curtis was found liable for battery against the four girls by Janet Neff, U.S. District Court Judge for the Western District of Michigan. A former Lakewood Public Schools board member who had started a group ministry with Curtis, Brian Potter, revealed for the first time in a 2015 deposition that Curtis had admitted to him in May 2012 that Curtis kissed one of the victims and had been \"inappropriate,\" but that Potter had not reported the conversation to authorities. In June 2017 Curtis' victims settled a civil lawsuit against Lakewood Public Schools for $575,000.\n\nIn September 2017 Curtis settled a federal civil lawsuit with three of his four victims. The fourth victim took Curtis to trial, and in October 2017 was awarded a $1.8 million judgment against Curtis.\n\nIn May 2018 a federal lawsuit was filed by one of Curtis' victims, claiming that Curtis transferred nearly all his money and assets to his ex-wife, Candace Curtis, in an effort to avoid the court-ordered payouts to his victims. Citing recorded telephone conversations between Chad and Candace Curtis, plaintiff's attorney Monica Beck said, \"They [Curtis and his ex-wife] transferred lots of money, vehicles, houses, and disposed and liquidated a lot of their assets, which they then tried to hide from the state of Michigan and then tried to hide from our client.\" Beck also cited a statement by Candace Curtis during one of those telephone conversations: \"I'm trying to keep things out of (victim's) hands.\" In January 2019 Candace Curtis lost a bankruptcy petition, with the ruling judge writing that \"[Candace Curtis] is simply attempting to forestall, if not escape, the post-judgment collection proceedings in District Court,\" and \"[Candace Curtis'] testimony [ ] is indicative of [her] lack of good faith.\"\n"}
{"id": "1821555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821555", "title": "Double clarinet", "text": "Double clarinet\n\nThe term double clarinet refers to any of several woodwind instruments consisting of two parallel pipes made of cane, bird bone, or metal, played simultaneously, with a single reed for each. Commonly, there are five or six tone holes in each pipe, or holes in only one pipe while the other acts as a drone, and the reeds are either cut from the body of the instrument or created by inserting smaller, slit tubes into the ends of the pipes. The player typically uses circular breathing.\n\nThe double clarinet is not a clarinet in the modern western sense of the term, since it lacks a register key; in this regard it is more closely related to the chalumeau.\n\nDouble clarinets are found primarily in Middle Eastern music, but also in India; there are different versions and names in different countries. In Yemen, the double clarinet is called a \"mizmār\" (a word used for other types of instruments in other countries). More common terms are \"zamr\", \"zammāra\", \"arghūl\", and \"mijwiz\". The first two of these names have the same linguistic root as \"mizmār\".\n\nIn Albania the instrument is called a \"zumare\". It has five holes in each pipe, and a bell.\n\nIn Egypt the instrument is known as a \"zummāra\". Both tubes are about thirty to thirty-five centimetres long; one may have four to six holes while the other has none and acts as a drone, or both can have holes. Its range is very limited, about a fourth.\n\nThe arghūl is primarily an Egyptian instrument, having a melody pipe with five to seven holes and a longer drone pipe without holes. It occurs in several sizes. In one specimen the melody and drone pipes are about 80 and 240 centimetres long, respectively, though the drone has removable sections to alter its pitch.\n\nThe Iraqi double clarinet is also called a \"zummāra\", although this term also is used for a single-tube simple clarinet. It is similar to the Syrian \"mijwiz\".\n\nIn Morocco and Tunisia the instrument, called \"zamr\", has a single or double bell. The Moroccan instrument has six holes in each pipe. The Moroccan \"mizmār\" or \"zamr rīfī\" is over 100 centimetres long, again with six holes in each pipe, ending in two bull's horns.\n\nThe double clarinet in Syria, western Iraq, Lebanon, northern Israel, and Jordan is called a \"mijwiz\". It is about thirty centimetres long, typically with six holes for each tube. Melodies are played in unison on both pipes, often with one pipe tuned slightly higher than the other to produce acoustic beats.\n\nThe Yemeni instrument is called a \"mizmār\". It is attached to the player's mouth using a muzzle.\n\nIn Italy, the Sicilian zampogna bagpipe, also called a \"ciaramedda\", is additionally referred to as a \"doppio clarinetto\" (double clarinet), because of its two equal length single reed chanters. A version of this instrument is also played in the Province of Reggio Calabria. Other single reed, double chanter bagpipes found in Southern Italy include the Sordulina and the zampogna \"a moderna\", both of which are found in Calabria. In the province of Messina, in the local dialect, the single blade can reed mounted in the instrument's chanters and drones is called a \"zammara.\"\n\nIn the island of Ibiza, in the Balearic Islands of Spain, there is the \"reclam de xeremies\". Basque Country has the \"alboka\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1821556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821556", "title": "Humber Super Snipe", "text": "Humber Super Snipe\n\nThe Humber Super Snipe is a car which was produced from 1938 to 1967 by British-based Humber Limited.\n\nThe Super Snipe was introduced in October 1938, derived by combining the four-litre inline six-cylinder engine from the larger Humber Pullman with the chassis and body of the Humber Snipe, normally powered by a three-litre engine. The result was a car of enhanced performance and a top speed of —fast for its day. Its design was contributed to by American engine genius Delmar \"Barney\" Roos who left a successful career at Studebaker to join Rootes in 1936.\n\nThe Super Snipe was marketed to upper-middle-class managers, professional people and government officials. It was relatively low-priced for its large size and performance, and was similar to American cars in appearance and concept, and in providing value for money.\n\nWithin a year of introduction, World War II broke out in Europe but the car continued in production as a British military staff car, the Car, 4-seater, 4x2, while the same chassis was used for an armoured reconnaissance vehicle, the Humber Light Reconnaissance Car.\n\nIn 1946, post-war civilian production resumed and the Super Snipe evolved through several versions, each designated by a Mark number, each generally larger, more powerful, and more modern, until production ended in 1957 with the Mark IVB version.\n\nThe Mark I was essentially a 6-cylinder version of the 1945 Humber Hawk, itself a facelifted pre-war car. A version of the 1930s Snipe remained available, with the 1936-introduced 2731 cc engine. However, the standard Super Snipe engine was the 4086cc side-valve engine that had appeared in the Humber Pullman nearly a decade earlier, in 1936, and which would continue to power post-war Super Snipes until 1952. Throughout the years 1936–1952 the maximum power output of the engine was always given by the manufacturer as 100 bhp at 3400 rpm.\n\nThe Mark II announced in mid-September 1948 was mostly redesigned in chassis and body. Now a full six-seater with a bench-type front seat it was given a wider track and a variable ratio steering unit. The gear lever was now mounted on the steering column. Like Humber's Pullman the headlights were fitted into the wings and running-boards were re-introduced. The transverse-spring independent suspension, first introduced on the Snipe and Pullman in 1935, continued but with 14 leaves instead of eight.\n\nThe smaller-engined Snipe was discontinued. Early Mark II Super Snipes can be distinguished by round lamps below the head lamps. The left one was a fog lamp, and the right one was a \"pass\" lamp with a low narrow beam for passing cars when using dipped headlights. These were dropped in 1949 in favour of rectangular side lamps which were continued in the Mark III.\n\n\"The Times\" motoring correspondent tested the new car at the end of 1948. The spare wheel was criticized as being difficult to extract and the indirect gears were, he thought, not as quiet as they might be. Overall the finish reflected the excellent taste that distinguished Rootes Group products\n\n125 drophead coupés were made by Tickford in 1949 and 1950.\n\nThe Mk III followed in August 1950. Easily identifiable by spats over the rear wheels it had a Panhard rod added to the rear suspension which limited sideways movement of the rear wheels and so permitted the use of softer springs. The 1950 car can be readily distinguished from the previous model by the simpler dome-shaped bumpers and the rectangular stainless-steel foot-treads on the running-boards.\n\nA Mk III tested by \"The Motor\" magazine in 1951 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 19.1 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1,471 including taxes.\nThe all-new Mark IV Super Snipe announced mid-October 1952, Earls Court Motor Show time, used a Hawk Mk IV body shell lengthened by but with a 4138 cc overhead-valve engine also used in a Rootes Group Commer truck. Chassis and suspension components were uprated to take the greater weight and power of the Super Snipe, those parts ceasing to be interchangeable with those of the Hawk. From 1955, overdrive was available as an option, followed in 1956 by an automatic gearbox.\n\nShortly after the car's announcement Leslie Johnson, Stirling Moss, and two Rootes Group staff, drove a new silver-grey Super Snipe from Oslo to Lisbon, travelling through fifteen European countries in 3 days, 17 hours and 59 minutes. The run demonstrated the car's high-speed reliability in far from ideal conditions.\n\nIn 1953 \"The Motor\" tested a Mk IV and found the larger engine had increased performance with the top speed now and acceleration from 0- in 14.7 seconds. Fuel consumption had increased to . The test car cost slightly more at £1,481, including taxes.\nThe Automatic Mk IV saloon tested by The Motor in 1956 Ref. 21/56 Continental, recorded a maximum speed of 97.0mph (mean) and 98.9mph (best). 0–60 mph acceleration was 14.8 sec, with a 0–90 in 38.2 sec, The Standing Quarter Mile was 20.4 sec. The axle ratio was 3.7:1 and maximum bhp 122 on a 7.13:1 compression ratio, as stated in the data panel of this road test.\n\nIn 1957 \"The Times\" commented that the car was handsome if somewhat dated. It attracted favourable attention from passers-by and gave its occupants a satisfying sense of solidity and respectability. The two separate front seats were described as \"enormous\" and it was noted their backs could be reclined to the horizontal for a passenger to sleep. The steering was described as generally imprecise, uncomfortably low-geared for parking, and in need of power assistance. The car represented \"remarkably fine\" value for money.\nIn October 1958, a new Super Snipe was introduced and first presented to the public at the opening of the Paris Salon de l'Automobile. Confusingly, the designation returned to the Super Snipe I, but this time the variants were identified by a \"series\" number. The new car was based on the unitized chassis and body of the four-cylinder Humber Hawk, but with a new 2.6 litre, 2,651 cc, six-cylinder overhead-valve engine based on an Armstrong Siddeley design with bore and stroke of and near-hemispherical combustion chambers producing 112 bhp at 5000 rpm.\n\nThis engine was matched to a three-speed manual transmission with optional Laycock de Normanville overdrive on second and top gears, or Borg Warner DG automatic transmission. Power steering was available as an option. Also offered was a touring limousine model with glass partition.\n\nThe new car was smaller on the outside, but larger on the inside, with improved performance and the appearance of a reduced size 4-door sedan.\nIn October 1959 the Series II entered production with its engine enlarged to 3 litres, 2,965 cc, by increasing the bore to . A new Zenith carburettor was fitted and the engine's output was raised to 129 bhp at 4800 rpm. A new eight-bladed fan improved engine cooling. Girling disc brakes were introduced on the front wheels with drums on the rear axle. A stiffer anti-roll bar was fitted to the front suspension.\n\nA Series II with overdrive and power steering was tested by \"The Motor\" in 1960 and had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 16.5 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1,601 including taxes. The basic car cost £1453.\n\nThe styling of the Series III which the Rootes Group announced in October 1960 was distinguishable by its four headlights and revised full-width grille. This Snipe was the first British car to fit two pairs of headlamps. The suspension of the car had been considerably modified along with the car's floor structure which improved the car's high speed stability. The front of the car was redesigned to give a lower bonnet line. The nose of the car was also lengthened by to accommodate an additional pulley, mounted on the front of the crankshaft, that enabled air conditioning to be included as an option, principally for the North American market. Separate ducts were provided for heating and cooling air to the passenger compartment. The engine received improved bearings with a changed lubrication system and was given better cooling with a quieter fan. Seats were redesigned to give more leg space for back seat passengers.\n\nWhen tested by \"The Times\" complaints focussed on a perceived need for more logical grouping of instruments, a horn ring obstructing the driver's view of the instruments and an over-bright white choke warning light. The power steering seemed to lack \"feel\". In direct top gear a speed of 95 mph was obtained, less if overdrive had been engaged.\n\nFor the October 1962 Motor Show there were minor improvements. The rear window was changed to give the roof line an improved appearance and now more nearly match the original shape. Engine output was now rated at bhp and the rear axle had been given a higher gear ratio. Manual gearbox cars received a new type of diaphragm clutch made by Borg and Beck and the petrol tank was enlarged from 12.5 to 16 gallons capacity. It can be distinguished by its revised rear-window treatment (doesn't wrap around quite as much as earlier models), Snipe bird badge on grille, opening quarter-light windows in the rear doors, and other trim differences.\nIn October 1964 the final Series V version of the Saloon saw an upper body restyle, (also applied to the Hawk Saloon and the Rootes Group's smaller Hillman Super Minx and its derivatives) with a flat roofline and rear window, six-light side windows and a larger, taller windscreen. The Estate body in both marques remained unchanged. Twin Zenith Stromberg 175CD carburettors were fitted along with a Harry Weslake tuned cylinder head, increasing the power to , and synchromesh was fitted to all ratios in the gearbox—on the previous versions it had only been on the upper two. Major modifications were made to front and rear suspensions and they required less maintenance. Sound insulation was further improved.\n\nHydrosteer power steering was available as an optional extra, as was an automatic transmission (Borg Warner Type 35 on Series Va), and metallic paint finishes. The motoring correspondent of the Motoring and Driving Register (July 1967) had this to say of the car: \"The Humber Super Snipe is an assured car for travelling comfortably from town to town and even on the new fast motorways. Yet its powerful engine allows it to handle the challenges of smaller lanes where the speeds rise and fall with each change of direction and each corner negotiated.\"\n\nIntended to match BMC's Rolls-Royce engined Vanden Plas Princess 4-litre R the Imperial shared the basic specification and performance of the Super Snipe with the addition of a vinyl roof, fully reclining front seats, automatic transmission and hydrosteer power steering as standard. However, a manual 3-speed transmission could be ordered. The car also featured electrically adjustable rear shock absorber settings, a separately controlled rear passenger heater and optional West-of-England cloth-trimmed seats as well as many smaller amenities such as individual reading lamps.\nThe Rootes Group ceased production of the Series Va version in July 1967, by which time the group was under the control of the American Chrysler Corporation. The last of the big Humbers were assembled by Chrysler in Melbourne, Australia. Plans to introduce a V8 engine, and for the Chrysler 180/2L to be marketed as a Humber in the UK did not materialise, although a small number of Chrysler LA engine (318ci) powered prototypes were built.\nWhile the post-World War II home market for the car continued as before, the Rootes Group also marketed the car for export. The Super Snipe was assembled in Australia, commencing in 1953 with the Mark IV. From 1956 the car was available with automatic transmission, but the model was discontinued shortly afterwards.\n\nSuper Snipes were also assembled in New Zealand for a number of years by Rootes Group and Chrysler importer Todd Motors which later became Mitsubishi New Zealand.\n\nRootes Humbers\n"}

{"id": "1821561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821561", "title": "Casa Bonita (South Park)", "text": "Casa Bonita (South Park)\n\n\"Casa Bonita\" is the eleventh episode of the seventh season of the American animated television series \"South Park\", and the 107th episode of the series overall. It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 12, 2003. In the episode, Cartman misleads Butters into going missing in order to gain an invitation to Kyle's birthday party. The titular restaurant in the episode is based on the real-life Casa Bonita, a Mexican-themed restaurant in Denver, Colorado.\n\nThe episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker. The show's writing team had the idea of Cartman convincing Butters to disappear long before the episode's production. The rest of the episode's storyline and script were developed in the week preceding its broadcast. The inclusion of Casa Bonita was based on the crew's memories of going there as children; Parker, co-creator Matt Stone, director Eric Stough, and other members of the show's staff had visited the restaurant before. As such, the show's depiction of the restaurant is fairly accurate.\n\nThe episode received positive reviews from television critics, and is one of Parker's favorite episodes. The real-life restaurant saw an increase in visitors following the episode's airing. \"Casa Bonita\" was released on DVD along with the rest of the seventh season in 2006, and it is currently available for streaming on Hulu.\n\nKyle announces that as a birthday treat, his mother Sheila is taking him and three of his friends to Casa Bonita. Cartman's initial joy is crushed when Kyle says he is taking Stan, Kenny, and Butters instead of Cartman, due to his rampant anti-Semitism. Cartman decides to prove that he is actually nice, but since kindness is such a foreign concept to him, his first attempts are unsuccessful. Eventually, he succeeds by apologizing for his actions and Kyle is touched, and tells him that if Butters is for some reason unable to attend, Cartman can. Cartman subsequently tells Butters that a meteor is about to hit Earth and hides him in a bomb shelter, so that he does not appear in time for the trip.\n\nCartman is set to replace Butters when Butters' parents tearfully inform the boys that Butters is missing, causing Kyle to postpone his party until next Saturday. Cartman then tells Butters that the meteor has hit, civilization has crumbled, and that the world is filled with radioactive cannibals. Butters' disappearance causes a town search party and several days later, the police announce that will be checking ducts, wells, and bomb shelters, potentially ruining Cartman's evil plan. He then guides Butters out of the shelter, making him wear a box over his head so he cannot see that everything is really okay under the pretense of protecting him from the radiation. Cartman relocates Butters to a broken-down gas station and he locks him in an abandoned refrigerator for his protection after pretending to get bit by a radioactive cannibal. After Cartman leaves, a garbage truck comes and takes Butters to the city dump. Butters mistakes the dump for post-apocalyptic Earth, and after finding a dog, tries to build a \"new civilization.\" A few days later, a female junkyard worker named Irene stumbles across Butters and tells him the truth about everything.\n\nJust as the party arrives at Casa Bonita, Sheila gets a phone call informing her of what has happened to Butters. She and the other boys confront Cartman, notifying him that the police are on their way. Knowing that his entire plan failed, Cartman makes a mad dash through the restaurant to sample every attraction and food in the last minute of freedom he has left. He is finally cornered by the police, Sheila, and the boys. Cartman, however, jumps off the fake waterfall. A police officer explains the trouble Cartman has caused, noting that he will be sent to juvenile hall for a week, made the whole town worried over nothing, and his friends now hate him. The officer asks Cartman if it was worth it, to which the latter responds, \"totally!\"\n\n\"Casa Bonita\" was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker. Like many \"South Park\" episodes, it was produced in the week preceding its broadcast. The concept for the episode came together at the last minute. One of the episode's plot elements, that Cartman convinces Butters that an asteroid is going to hit Earth, existed for a \"long time\" before the episode entered production. It was a Thursday—one week before the episode's airdate—when the show's writing team developed the concept that Cartman would be invited to a birthday party if Butters were unable to go.\n\nThe titular restaurant in the episode is based on the real-life Casa Bonita, a Mexican-themed \"eatertainment\" restaurant in the Denver suburb of Lakewood, Colorado. Parker and co-creator Matt Stone had both gone to the restaurant as children. They received clearance from Casa Bonita to use their name and likeness, which Parker and co-creator Matt Stone thought was very unusual, making them \"even cooler.\" The restaurant inquired as to whether it would be the subject of mockery, to which Parker responded, \"How can we rip on Casa Bonita? That was your dream as a kid, to be able to go to Casa Bonita for your birthday.\" The design of the restaurant in \"South Park\" is modeled heavily on the actual place. The show's animation director, Eric Stough, had also gone to Casa Bonita as a child, and other individuals on the crew from Kansas and New Mexico were familiar with the restaurant.\n\nParker has called \"Casa Bonita\" among his top ten favorite episodes of \"South Park\". In 2012, Mark Tornga, writing for \"The A.V. Club\", wrote that \"\"South Park\" delivered the best possible commercial for this restaurant/adventurescape with the surprisingly accurate and compelling 2003 \"Casa Bonita\" episode of the show. Of the hundred or so Google and Yelp reviews I've read about Casa Bonita, a solid half of them mentioned Cartman or \"South Park\" as their motivation for dining.\"\n\nThe actual Casa Bonita has seen a boost in visitors since the episode's airing. \"The Denver Post\" ran an article about the restaurant in 2014, and its general manager noted that the \"South Park\" episode helped its business: \"Our demographics have changed slightly because of the \"South Park\" episode. We are now cool with the 18-25- year-olds [\"sic\"].\"\n\n\"Casa Bonita\", along with the fourteen other episodes from \"South Park\"s seventh season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on March 26, 2006. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. The episode is available for streaming on Hulu and Netflix\n\n"}

This palimpsest is the oldest copy of the gospels in Syriac, one of two surviving manuscripts (the other being the Curetonian Gospels) that are conventionally dated to before the Peshitta, the standard Syriac translation,\n\nBoth the Syriac Sinaiticus (designated syr) and the Curetonian Gospels (designated syr) contain similar renderings of the gospel text, exhibiting conformity with the Greek. Even so, syr retains some readings from even earlier lost Syriac gospels and from the 2nd-century Septuagint manuscripts, which brought the four gospels into harmony with one another through selective readings and emendations.\n\nIt had been ascertained that the Diatessaron, or Harmony of the Four Gospels, composed by Tatian in the second century, had to be supplanted in the Syrian churches. There was a promulgation by Bishop Rabbula of Edessa in between AD 411 and 435, that four separate Gospels come into being in use in Syriac churches.\n\nThe importance of such early, least conforming texts is emphasized by the revision of the Peshitta that was made about 508, ordered by bishop Philoxenus of Mabbog. His revision, it is said, skilfully moved the Peshitta nearer to the Greek text; \"it is very remarkable that his own frequent gospel quotations preserved in his writings show that he used an Old Syriac set of the four gospels\".\n\nThe palimpsest was identified in the library at Saint Catherine's Monastery in February 1892 by Agnes Smith Lewis and her sister Margaret Dunlop Gibson, who returned with a team of scholars that included J. Rendel Harris, to photograph and transcribe the work in its entirety. It is still kept by the Monastery.\n\nThe German theologian Adalbert Merx devoted much of his later research to the elucidation of the Sinaitic Palimpsest, the results being embodied in \"Die vier kanonischen Evangelien nach dem ältesten bekannten Texte\" (1897-1905).\n\nThe Sinaitic Palimpsest immediately became a central document in tracing the history of the New Testament. The palimpsest's importance lies especially in making the Greek New Testament manuscripts understandable to Aramaic speaking communities during that period.\n\nThe palimpsest lacks the last 12 verses of Mark, Christ's agony (Luke 22:43-44), the Pericope Adulteræ (John 7:53-8:11), and the reconciliation of Pilate with Herod (Luke 23:10-12).\n\nIn Matthew 1:16, it contains \"Joseph, to whom was betrothed Mary the Virgin, begat Jesus, who is called the Christ\"\n\nIn Matthew 4:10, it contains a singular reading reflecting the Greek ὕπαγε ὀπίσω σου (\"get you behind\" or \"get behind you\").\n\nMatthew 12:47 is omitted, as in א*, B, L, Γ, 1009, ℓ \"12\", ff, k, syr, cop.\n\nIn Matthew 14:12, it reflects πτωμα (\"corpse\") with א B C D L Θ \"f\" \"f\" 33 565 700 892 1241 1424 e k ℓ \"844\" ℓ \"2211\" syr cop\n\nIn Matthew 16:12, it reflects της ζυμης (\"leaven\") with D, Θ, \"f\", 565, a, b, ff\n\nMatthew 21:44 is omitted, as in formula_1, D, 33, it, ff, ff, r, Irenaeus, Origen, Eusebius\n\nIn Matthew 27:9, text reflecting Ιερεμιου (\"Jeremiah\") is omitted, as in Φ 33 it it syr cop\n\nIn Matthew 27:16, it reflects Ἰησοῦν τὸν Βαραββᾶν (\"Jesus the Barabbas\") with Θ \"f\" 700* arm geo\n\nIn Mark 2:26, the phrase \"when Abiatar was high priest\" is omitted, as in D, W, 1009, 1546, it\n\nIn Mark 10:2, the phrase \"the Pharisees came\" is omitted, as in D, it, (syr)\n\nIn Mark 10:7, the phrase \"and be joined to his wife\" is omitted, as in א, B, Ψ, 892*, 2427, ℓ \"48\", goth.\n\nIn Luke 4:17, it reflects ἀνοίξας (\"opened\") with A, B, L, W, Ξ, 33, 579, 892, 1195, 1241, ℓ \"547\", syr, cop\n\nIn Luke 9:35, it reflects ἐκλελεγμένος (\"Elect One\") with formula_1 formula_1 א B L Ξ 892 1241 it vgst cop\n\nIn Luke 10:41b-42a, the phrase \"you are worried and being troubled about many things, but only one thing is needed\" is omitted, as in it Ambrose\n\nIn Luke 23:34, the phrase \"And Jesus said: Father forgive them, they know not what they do\" is omitted, agreeing with formula_1, א, B, D*, W, Θ, 0124, 1241, a, Bezae, cop, cop.\n\nLuke 24:40 is omitted, as in D it, syr\n\nIn Luke 24:52, the phrase \"after worshiping him\" is omitted, as in D it (syr)\n\nIn Luke 24:53, it reflects εὐλογοῦντες (\"blessing\") with formula_1 א B C* L\n\nIn John 1:34, it reflects ὁ ἐκλεκτός (\"the Elect One\") with formula_1 formula_1 א* it syr\n\nIn John 6:23, the phrase \"the Lord having given thanks\" is omitted, as in D 091 it syr\n\nIn John 6:42, the phrase \"and his mother\" is omitted, as in א* W it syr\n\nIn John 6:46, it contains a singular reading reflecting the Greek θεον πατερα (\"God the Father\").\n\nIn John 6:47, it reflects ὁ πιστεύων εις θεον ἔχει ζωὴν αἰώνιον (\"he who is believing in God has life everlasting\") in agreement only with syr.\n\nIn John 6:51, it reflects του εμου ἄρτου (\"my bread\") with א it\n\nIn John 6:64, the text \"who they are who are not believing, and\" is omitted, as in formula_1 it syr\n\nIn John 7:32, the phrase \"the chief priests and the Pharisees\" is omitted, as in 118 it\n\nIn John 8:16, text reflecting πατήρ (\"father\") is omitted, as in א* D 1655* it syr\n\nIn John 8:53, the phrase \"our father\" is omitted, as in D W it cop\n\nIn John 9:18, the phrase \"had been blind and had received sight\" is omitted, as in formula_1 \"f\" 565 it cop\n\nIn John 9:35, it reflects υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου (\"Son of Man\") with formula_1 formula_1 א B D W cop\n\nIn John 11:25, the phrase \"and the life\" is omitted, as in formula_1 it Diatessaron Cyprian\n\nIn John 11:39, the phrase \"the sister of the deceased\" is omitted, as in Θ it ac\n\nIn John 11:51, the phrase \"of that year\" is omitted, as in formula_1 it\n\nJohn 12:8 is omitted, as in D it\n\nIn John 13:32, the phrase \"If God has been glorified in him\" is omitted, as in formula_1 א* B C* D L W X 579 it vg syr ac mf co\n\nIn John 14:1, the phrase \"And he said to his disciples\" starts the passage, as in D it\n\nJohn 14:14 in omitted, as in X Λ* 0141 \"f\" 565 it vg arm\n\nJohn 16:3 is omitted.\n\nIn John 16:28, the phrase \"I came forth from the Father\" is omitted, as in D W it ac cop\n\nIn John 17:14, the phrase \"just as I am not of the world\" is omitted, as in formula_1 D \"f\" it\n\nIn John 18:5, the phrase \"the one betraying him\" is omitted, as in formula_1\n\nIn John 18:13-24, the verse order is 13, 24, 14-15, 19–23, 16–18\n\nIn John 20:1, the text reads \"from the opening of the tomb\" with א W \"f\" 22 565 579 it vg cop cop\n\nJohn 20:13 contains an interpolation (in bold): \"Woman, why are you weeping?

It is very similar in appearance to the closely related edible frog and pool frog. These three species, now again in the genus \"Pelophylax\", are often referred to as \"green frogs\" to distinguish them from the more terrestrial European \"Rana\" species, which are known as \"brown frogs\" (best exemplified by the common frog \"Rana temporaria\").\n\nThe marsh frog is a water-dwelling, generally green-coloured frog species. It can reach a maximum length of 17 centimetres, but males remain smaller (around 12 cm). The head is proportionally large and the hind legs are long, which gives them excellent jumping abilities.\n\nThere is a large variation in colour and pattern, ranging from dark green to brown or grey, sometimes with some lighter green lines; a lighter line on the back is generally present. The Western European populations are generally dark green to black with dark spots on the back and sides and three clear green lines on the back.\n\nThere are known three hybridogenetic hybrids of the marsh frog:\nTheir populations are maintained however through other crossings by hybridogenesis.\n\nThe diet of the marsh frog consists of dragonflies and other insects, spiders, earthworms, and slugs. Larger frogs also eat small rodents and sometimes smaller amphibians and fish.\n\nThe marsh frog occurs in a large part of Europe, and in Asia east to ca. 81° E in Asiatic Russia, south to western Iran and Afghanistan, as well as isolated populations in Saudi Arabia. They prefer a water temperature of approximately 15 °C.\n\nIt is now distinguished from \"Pelophylax kurtmuelleri\" (Balkan frog), which it resembles greatly, and which outnumbers it in most of Greece.\n\n\nListen to \"Pelophylax ridibundus\" call sound\n"}

{"id": "1821598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821598", "title": "William Ellis (missionary)", "text": "William Ellis (missionary)\n\nWilliam Ellis (29 August 1794 – 9 June 1872) was an English missionary and author. He travelled through the Society Islands, Hawaiian Islands, and Madagascar, and wrote several books describing his experiences.\n\nHe was born in London of working-class parents on 24 August 1794. His father (from Norwich) and a short-lived older brother (25 May 1793 – 3 December 1793) were also named William. (If a child died young, parents often named another child by the same name, especially if they wanted to pass on a parent's or grandparent's name.)\n\nNot much is known of his mother; her maiden name was Sarah Bedborough (died in Wisbech on 15th February, 1837 aged 75), she was born in Reading, England, and married William Ellis on 13 August 1792.\nTheir other children were: Sarah Ellis(c1797), Mary Ellis(born c1803), Ann Barnard (born Ellis c1805) and Thomas Ellis(born c1800).\n\nHe was brought by his parents to Wisbech, Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire at the age of four. Young William developed a love of plants in his youth and became a gardener. He worked first in Wisbech and then Thorney in the Isle of Ely, later moving to Outwell to work for Rev. Hardwicke. He had left school by the age of twelve, then at a nursery north of London, and eventually for a wealthy family in Stoke Newington. Being of a religious nature, he applied to train as a Christian missionary for the London Missionary Society and was accepted to the school. He began writing at the age of 12, on being urged by a Unitarian minister at elementary school named Wright, who discerned his talent at an early age.\n\nAfter attending Homerton College, then in Hampstead, Ellis was ordained in 1815. He married Mary Mercy Moor (born 16 October 1793) on 9 November 1815. she was the daughter of Alexander Moor (from Perth, died c1794) and Mary Mercy (died 1799).\n\nHe was soon posted to the South Sea Islands with his wife, leaving England on 23 January 1816. They arrived at Eimeo, one of the Windward Islands, via Sydney, and learned the language there. His daughter Mary (1817–1837) was born. During their stay, several chiefs of nearby Pacific islands who had assisted Pomare in regaining sovereignty of Tahiti, visited Eimeo and welcomed the LMS missionaries (including John Orsmond and John Williams and their wives) to their own islands. All three missionary families went to Huahine, arriving in June 1818, drawing crowds from neighbouring islands, including King Tamatoa of Raiatea.\nThey had four children, Mary (1817-1837), John Eimeo Ellis (born 1818), Elizabeth (1820–1858) and Ann Ellis (1821–1862). \n\nEllis and a small group travelled from Tahiti on the schooner \"Mermaid\" to the Hawaiian Islands, known then as the Sandwich Islands. On the same voyage, another small schooner called \"Prince Regent\", outfitted with six cannons, was presented to King Kamehameha II. The party arrived in Honolulu on 16 April 1822. Although the plan had been to also visit the Marquesas Islands, it returned to Tahiti on 27 August 1822.\n\nEllis was invited to stay and he arranged for his family to come to Hawaii, where they arrived on the \"Active\" on 4 February 1823. In June 1823 Ellis joined the American Missionaries Asa Thurston, Artemas Bishop, and Joseph Goodrich on a tour of the island of Hawaii, to investigate suitable sites for mission stations. On the way he stopped at Maui and met and baptized Queen Keōpūolani. Their first stop was Kailua-Kona, where they met the Governor of the island, Kuakini, who was known as John Adams.\n\nEllis and his party visited Kealakekua Bay, and toured the historic sites nearby, such as the Puuhonoua o Hōnaunau. They travelled south past the Mauna Loa volcano. They were some of the first Europeans to visit the caldera of the Kīlauea volcano, which was active at the time. On the eastern side they visited Hilo and Waipio Valley, and some of the party continued up snow-covered Mauna Kea.\n\nSome of the important missions set up as a result of this trip include Mokuaikaua Church, Imiola Church, Kealakekua Church, and the Haili Church. Returning to Honolulu, Ellis set about learning the Hawaiian language. He transcribed the language into a Roman alphabet and helped set up a printing press.\n\nIn August 1824 they had to return to England, as Mrs Ellis was in poor health, and so took a ship via America. Back in London, Ellis published his narrative of travels in Hawaii. He was selected as Assistant Foreign Secretary of the London Missionary Society in 1830 and its Chief Foreign Secretary in 1832. His wife Mary, mother of four children, died on 11 January 1835. In 1836, Crocker & Brewster published a biography by her husband, \"Memoir of Mrs. Mary Mercy Ellis\".\n\nEllis remarried two years later to Sarah Stickney (1799–1872) on 23 May, the couple were unable to have a wedding trip as William's eldest daughter was ill, she died in June and was buried in Bunhill Fields burial-ground, next to her mother. She had been brought up a Quaker but latterly chosen to become an Independent or Congregationalist, as did many of those involved in the London Missionary Society, albeit a non-denominational one. She shared her husband's love of books and of writing. He had started to become a successful writer about the topography, history, botany, and ethnography of Polynesia since returning from the South Seas. Sarah Ellis gained her own success, primarily with books on women's role in society.\n\nEllis's most important work was \"Polynesian Researches\". This established him as a talented ethnographic and geographical writer, and was reviewed in the \"Quarterly Review\" by Robert Southey: \"A more interesting book we have never perused.\" This and similar acclaim for Ellis's writing from others influenced investors to regard the missionaries more favourably, particularly the LMS missionaries. They had previously been portrayed as naively raising the expectations, educational level, liberty and status of slaves and native peoples, rather than taking a traditionally hard-headed approach to trade and commerce.\n\nEllis was asked by the directors of the LMS to write up his studies of Madagascar, which were published in 1838 as the two-volume \"History of Madagascar\". In 1844 the first volume of his \"History of the London Missionary Society\" was also published. Due to ill health, Ellis resigned from the LMS, wanting also to spend more time with his wife Sarah in their house in the country village of Hoddesdon in Hertfordshire, twenty miles north of London, which she had set us Rawdon House in 1840. In 1847, he was offered a post in Hoddesdon as pastor of its Congregational church.\n\nAfter five years, Ellis recovered his health and accepted an LMS offer to travel to Madagascar as their official emissary. Arriving in 1853, he was rebuffed by officials in attempting to establish a mission and refused permission to go to the capital. Establishing a temporary base in Mauritius, he again sought entry to Madagascar, but was refused. He made a third visit in 1856, but Queen Ranavalona I permitted him only a one-month stay. To mark these events he wrote \"Three Visits to Madagascar\" (1858).\n\nEllis returned to Wisbech in April, 1860, delivering an address on Madagascar. A collection was taken and later used to provide a gift of a ‘Blackie’s Imperial Atlas’ and a clock to Radama II, King of Madagascar. A photographic portrait of the king in military dress, with his crown on a table, taken by Ellis was displayed at the Wisbech Working Men's Institute. \n\nOn his fourth attempt in 1861, Ellis was finally permitted entry. French influence in the area was said to have been a factor hitherto, as the French did not want other Europeans gaining a toehold on the island. Ellis stayed until 1865, gradually laying the foundations for Christianity. He returned to a great welcome in England in 1865 and was asked to lecture widely about his travels and his religious influence in the islands.\nEllis returned to Wisbech in 1867 to give a further talk on Madagascar in the Lecture Room at Wisbech Public Hall. Ellis was a member of Wisbech Working Men's Institute, after his death a fellow member Samuel Smith (photographer) printed some of his photographs. A portrait in oils of Elis was presented to the Working Men's Institute by Mr Johnathan Peckover for display, it is now (2019) in Wisbech & Fenland Museum. Specimens of costumes and cloth brought back by Ellis were presented to the museum.\nFour years later, in 1869, Queen Ranavalona II and the royal court of Madagascar converted to Christianity.\n\nEllis's books about his experiences and the history and geography of the island were \"Madagascar Revisited\" (1867) and \"Martyr Church of Madagascar\" (1870).\n\nEllis caught cold while on a train journey and died on 9 June 1872.\nSarah Ellis died seven days later on 16 June.\nThey had been married for 35 years.\n\nEllis is buried in a venerated spot in the Congregationalists' non-denominational Abney Park Cemetery in London, near where Isaac Watts once lived. His intricately carved hip tomb is aligned with its chapel. His wife preferred to be buried near their country home. A biography written by his son John Ellis and Henry Allon was published soon after his death.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1821600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821600", "title": "James Craig (architect)", "text": "James Craig (architect)\n\nJames Craig (31 October 1739 – 23 June 1795) was a Scottish architect who worked mostly in lowlands of the country and especially his native city of Edinburgh. He is remembered primarily for his layout of the first Edinburgh New Town.\n\nJames Craig's birth date is traditionally given as 1744, as his baptism is recorded in parish register as Tuesday 13 November 1744. However, more recent research has shown that his birth date was 31 October 1739, as recorded in the registers of George Watson's Hospital, where Craig was educated. As well as his date of birth, the records show he entered the school in 1748, and left in 1755. The 1744 date must therefore be incorrect, as it would mean he started school aged four, and left aged eleven. The baptism year, although not the date, has been shown to be in error, as 13 November fell on a Tuesday in 1739 also.\n\nJames Craig was the son of William Craig (1695–1762), a merchant, and Mary Thomson (1710–1790), sister of the poet James Thomson (1700–1748). In later life, the architect was famous for being the nephew of the poet. However, closer examination of his family history shows that he had well established links to Edinburgh Town Council, Edinburgh College and the city's Churches where he would later find work as an architect. He was also proud to be a Craig, and his letter seal bore the Craig arms and motto.\n\nHis father was William Craig, a son of Robert Craig (1660–1738), a businessman and successful local politician, and Elizabeth Handieside. He had eight siblings of whom James, John and Janet lived into later life, with other sisters Marion and Agnes also reaching adulthood. Witnesses to the births of Robert Craig's children denote his political and professional friends. These included politicians with links to the College and Town Council, and clergymen.\n\nFrom 1694 Robert Craig had trained to be a merchant in Edinburgh. Though in late in life to do so, this decision was a good one as he and his elder brother, John Craig, who was a lawyer. Together the Craigs formed an effective partnership in managing money, loans, merchandise and property. The family legacy was that the architect James Craig inherited a family used to discussing and managing property planning and building.\n\nFrom being a burgess and guildbrother of Edinburgh and a church elder (Greyfriars, Edinburgh, 1701 on), by 1704 Robert had been elected to the city's Town Council. Within two years he was Edinburgh College's Treasurer, and then Baillie of Leith in 1707, an Edinburgh Baillie after 1708, and Water Baillie of Leith in 1709. His rise was impressive enough to be elected a Governor of George Heriot's Hospital in 1710. The very same year he was made a burgess of the burgh of Canongate.\n\nThe next decade saw Robert Craig's political career continue to flourish. In 1713 he was elected Baron Baillie of Canongate, and from 1714 he became Edinburgh Town Council's moderator of stent tax, annually levied on property values, and its Dean of Guild. As Dean he held one of the top three posts in the Town Council beside the Treasurer and Lord Provost. He served a full three-year term in this post until 1717. In this period, from 1714 to 1716, he was Edinburgh's Commissioner of the General Convention of Royal Burghs. Here he saw applications from other Scottish towns and cities to expand and improve through new harbours, bridges and roads.\n\nIn his later years as an active politician until 1720 Robert Craig could be found in Town Council meetings and affairs as \"Old Dean of Guild\" Craig or \"Old Baillie\" Craig. He oversaw tax collection, accounts, the city's market and property management. He was clearly a capable and trusted administrator of the city's affairs, and one who oversaw building up the city's interests and physical size. As well as writing reports on the city's finances, in 1719 he also inspected land around Broughton and Multrees Hill - the area near where the New Town was planned out.\n\nRobert Craig would have known many architects and tradesmen as well as politicians. Not least among these magistrates would have been George Drummond. From 1723 Drummond had the ambition to create Edinburgh's New Town through petitions to Parliament to building Register House.\n\nRobert Craig's sons, James (1691–1775) and John became clerks to the Presbyterian Church of Scotland's Assembly in Edinburgh, and after 1715 joined his brother William in being made a burgess and guildbrother of Edinburgh through his father. The Craig family home was a temple tenement at the foot of West Bow facing the Corn Market. In later years, they all, including James the architect, lived in the first floor apartment of this property.\n\nIn business, Robert traded in many different goods but died leaving debts to be paid. William took on his business and managed his father's bank account into the 1740s. Newspaper advertisements from the 1730s and 1740s reveal that his shop was in Forglen's Land from where he also traded in many goods, including tobacco and sugar. William did not follow his father into Town Council politics, but in 1745 he was elected by the magistrates to be its sword and mace bearer for formal processions and ceremonies which gave an allowance of £200 (Scots). However, at the same time, like his father, he too ran into business difficulties.\n\nOf the six children he and Mary Thomson had, James was the only one to survive infancy. By then 1750s, William Craig's business was in serious decline, and through rights of his grandfather and father's lives as merchants and familial poverty, James was able to claim a place at George Watson's College, which had been recently set up as a school to educate the sons of \"deceased and indigent\" merchants.\n\nAlthough James Craig the architect celebrated his family's history primarily through the poet, James Thomson, a review of the books and goods he kept at the family home indicate that there were family heirlooms there inherited from his grandfather Robert. These included a twenty-four-hour clock and pewter plates. Other inheritances were probably old books on religion which Robert, James and John had kept.\n\nHowever, it clear from his business affairs, library and goods, that Craig spent money collecting books and objects celebrating James Thomson and the poets and followers in his circle in England. In fact, Thomson's poetry influenced his work as an architect. He often edited his Uncle's poems to quote them on plans, or derived decorations for buildings based on Thomson's most famous poem, the Seasons. In business, he asked members of the Thomson family to help him. For his contract with the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh he had the financial support of blood relatives James Bell, a Minister in Coldstream, and butcher, Robert Thomson, in Lanark.\nFrom 1773 he lived with his uncle, also James Craig, Session Clerk to the High Court, at the foot of West Bow (sometimes then called the Well Bow), off the Grassmarket.\n\nIn 1775 he even donated a portrait by John Baptist Medina (1659–1710) of the poet to Edinburgh College, which was widely reported in the press and had a dedication to Thomson on its frame. Craig promoted himself as the most celebrated living relative of Thomson. Throughout his career as an architect he was widely noted as the poet's nephew in books, the media, and participated in public and private celebrations of Thomson's life and work in both England and Scotland.\n\nAs he grew older it was clear that James Craig family line was going to end with the architect's death. However, he had contact with relatives from the Thomson family in Lanarkshire. James Craig's focus on Thomson led to his obituary in volume IV of the Scots Register of 1796 suggesting that the architect believed he should be chosen for work primarily because of his relationship to the famous poet rather than sound business practice. The validity of this remark can be debated but it was clear to all that family commitments played significant roles in Craig's business and architecture.\n\nIn 1755 Craig left school aged sixteen. This was because he was to be the apprentice to the incorporation of wrights and masons of Edinburgh, and its Council Deacon Patrick Jamieson. Given the anticipation of the city's New Town through suggested plans, petitions, pamphlets and most recently the city's Improvement Act of 1753, taking up a career in building was confident and ambitious. The incorporation and Craig agreed that his training would begin in 1759 and run for the normal six-year period. Writing in April 1777, as an architect, Craig told Edinburgh Town Council's Chamberlain that he had been \"bred in the executive part\" of his business as an architect.\n\nWhilst studying under Jamieson Craig would have seen and known the mason's building projects. These included the new Exchange building where Jamieson was chief mason. Through his master and such prestigious projects, Craig would have met a number of architects, including John Adam (1721–1792). He had designed the Exchange and was to later supervise Craig’s work in Edinburgh and elsewhere.\n\nLike other apprentices, Craig was also expected to read architectural treatises, such as Palladio's books on architecture, and learn how to draw the architectutral orders, plan and survey buildings, use building materials and prepare accounts. The architecture books and equipment he kept in his apartment, together with sculptures of artists and writers there, indicate that Craig presented himself as a cultivated, skilled and tasteful architect. Like John Adam, Craig did not go on a \"Grand Tour\" of Europe to draw antiquities and study at academies or under other architects.\n\nIn fact, in 1762, just three years into his apprenticeship, his father died. Quite what the twenty three year old apprentice decided to do then remains unrecorded. Surviving evidence suggests he chose to develop a career as a draughtsman and architect.\n\nHe was due to complete his apprenticeship in 1765, and yet his name appeared in a published plan for the proposed bridge over the Nor Loch in the Scots Magazine in July 1763 North Bridge. Signed \"James Craig Delint\" it indicated his skill as a draughtsman, and intention to become known as a designer or architect.\n\nAlthough the incorporation did not record Craig submitting his \"essay\" for examination and being accepted into the incorporation as a freeman mason in the usual way, in June 1765 the incorporation's rolls of apprentices does noted Deacon Jamieson discharging James Craig as his apprentice. This same year Craig was due to sit his essay to become a freeman mason of the incorporation, but the discharge meant that he missed this exam and never formally entered the incorporation itself.\n\nInstead, he set himself up as a draughtsman or architect. For in 1765, Craig also prepared a plan for a road running from Holyrood through the south of Canongate dating to 1765 which was completed for the Middle Road District. Both the bridge and road indicate Craig's interest in town planning.\n\nFollowing on from his work in 1765, Craig entered the competition to plan the New Town of Edinburgh in 1766 through which he won his fame and reputation as an architect. He spent the next fifteen years working on plans and buildings for the New Town, and presented two of these in the portrait painting David Allan made in 1781; a New Town plan with a central circus, and the Royal College of Physicians Hall with proposed wings to either side.\n\nPlans for a New Town, to ease overcrowding in the medieval Royal burgh of Edinburgh, had been suggested since the late 17th century. However, it was not until the middle of the 18th century that Lord Provost George Drummond (1688–1766) succeeded in extending the town boundary to encompass the fields to the north of the Nor Loch. A competition was held in January 1766, in which six plans were entered. Craig's was considered the best, and he was awarded the prize; the Freedom of the City and a gold medal.\n\nHowever, his design was not initially considered suitable for construction, and was reviewed by a committee, including the law judges Lord Kames (1696–1782), Lord Elliock (1712–1793) and Lord Hailes (1726–1792) and architects John Adam and William Mylne (1734–1790), and Sir James Clerk, 3rd Baronet (1709–1783). With the judges advice Craig drew up the final approved version, and a feuing plan to match it so that prospective property developers and owners could see what the New Town would look like and buy a building plot. It was formally adopted by Edinburgh Town Council in July 1767, and later that year presented to King George III (1738–1820). Craig soon had plan made into a print and copies were sold by bookshops and from his own home at the foot of Edinburgh's West Bow.\n\nThe plan comprised a simple rectilinear arrangement of three parallel main streets (Princes Street, George Street and Queen Street) with a square at each end (St Andrew Square and Charlotte Square). From 1770 to 1781 Craig offered at least three alternative New Town plans which included a large circus at the centre of the development, although this idea was never adopted.\n\nConstruction of the New Town began in 1767 with St Andrew's Square in the east, and continued until after Craig's death in 1795, with Charlotte Square being completed in 1800. Craig was responsible only for the layout of the streets, and had no design input into the appearance of most new buildings apart from his the Royal College of Physicians Hall and Library on the south side of George Street (1776–1781). Unbuilt designs included wings to either side of the Hall (1779–1781) and for the new Assembly Rooms on the same side of the street(1781), and for buildings on Lord Ankerville's plot on Princes Street(1777).\n\nCraig is best known as the architect who planned Edinburgh's New Town and surviving examples of his work indicate that he had a profound interest in town planning and urban architecture.\n\nIn Edinburgh he designed other new streets and squares including St James Square and Merchant Street from 1772 to 1774. In the next decade he also proposed plans, such as in 1786 he published a pamphlet \"Plan for Improving the City of Edinburgh\", which included proposals for remodelling the Old Town, with squares and crescents along the Royal Mile as his plan for the new south bridge and college. Two years later he then designed of a large square for the Edinburgh merchant Robert Hope which was also a development on the south side of Edinburgh. Other town plans included proposed development of Leith, including a long boulevard for Leith Walk linking that burgh with Edinburgh New Town.\nIn terms of actually surveying and building urban housing, in 1772 he prepared a property on the top floor of a tenement on Smith's Land on the north side of the High Street for sale, and in 1779 surveyed a tenement in Libberton Wynd and built a new one on North Bridge Street.\n\nElsewhere, Craig prepared plans for the development of Glasgow. This was firstly for Trongate's Tontine Hotel from 1781 to 1782. A decade later, he planned the Blythswood estate, to the city's west end, and adjoining lands owned by Glasgow Town Council. The city's town council minutes for 9 August 1792 recorded that \" Mr Craig Architect in Edinbugh\" was to \" plan Meadowflatt for building ground as Mr Craig is employed by Colonel Campbell of Blythswood to make a plan of his building ground in the neighbourhood of Meadowflatt and it will be attended with considerable advantage to have the streets upon the two grounds uniform to and corresponding with each other\". While nothing was built until the 19th century, Craig may be responsible for the strict grid layout of the area and thereby responsible for shaping both central Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n\nCraig never held a salaried post as architect to Edinburgh Town Council or any other Scottish Town Council but he did enjoy the patronage of several Edinburgh Lord Provosts from Gilbert Laurie in 1767 to David Steuart in 1781, and was employed to work in other towns and cities in Scotland including Dundee and Glasgow. In Dundee he designed the new church in 1769 which later became St Andrew's Church, and his work in Glasgow took place from 1781 to 1792.\n\nBut, it was for Edinburgh Town Council that he worked the longest. Remembering that this Town Council oversaw the New Town's planning and building meant that Craig frequently presented plans to Lord Provosts and its committees for approval. Such presentations included those for the New Town plan leading to the final authorized plan, and feuing plan, of 1767. These were followed by the circus plan variants of 1770, 1774 and 1780.\n\nDespite not being adopted, Craig retained the confidence of the magistrates and merchants who dominated it. For example, in 1774 the Merchant Company of Edinburgh asked Craig to plan it a new street, south of the Old Town's Cowgate. To advertise it for development, Craig proposed a facades of its buildings.\n\nFollowing the New Town, the Town Council asked Craig to plan the Town its Observatory on Calton hill from 1775 to 1776 and he was then contracted to build it. The new City Observatory on Calton Hill had a gothic tower, now known as Observatory House, which was the only part to be completed before money ran out in 1777. The rest was finally finished in 1792, although this too was replaced, by William Henry Playfair (1790–1857) in 1818.\n\nIn 1777 Craig was then asked to plan the refurbishment of the New Church St Giles' Cathedral, and entered the competition to plan Leith Ballast Quay. He was initially chosen to build the quay but was replaced by mason, William Jamieson, son of his former master in the incorporation of wrights and masons. He also in this year planned the funerary monument for Lord Provost Alexander Kincaid intended.\n\nThe New Church work kept Craig busy from 1780 and 1781. In these years, he also prepared plans for the proposed new Bridewell, new Edinburgh College classrooms and oversaw the building of Leith Gun Battery Leith where he had design control over the building elevations but not over technical aspects of the fort. The main gate and guard house remain, although the rest of the fort was demolished in the 1950s.\n\nSuch public architecture projects were commonly funded by Edinburgh Town Council working in partnership with national government. For examples, the New Church and Leith Gun Battery were partially funded by government grants. Other projects, such as the Inverkeithing Lazaretto in 1771, Royal Botanical Gardens from 1774 to 1782, and May Island Lighthouse in 1786 were all also partially funded through national government and its agencies.\n\nPoliticians aside, another significant source of patronage and friendship Craig enjoyed was from academic professionals including physicians, lawyers, professors to gentlemen living in country houses.\n\nThe most significant building Craig designed and undertook in the Edinburgh New Town was Hall and Library of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (1776–1781) on the south side of George Street, directly facing the later church of St Andrews and St George on the opposite side of the Street. In 1775 former College President Sir Alexander Dick of Prestonfield expressed his approval of the college's choice of Craig as the architect of its long-awaited new Hall. This was not first time that Craig had worked with physicians. Whilst in London in 1767 and 1768, he worked with Sir John Pringle (1707–1782) to present his New Town plan to King George III, then in 1772 in Edinburgh he planned the development of Robertson's Close for Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.\n\nFor the Physicians' Hall, Craig worked closely with William Cullen (1710–1790) to agree his contract and then present drawings and proposals for the Hall's enlargement to the Town Council from 1776 to 1780. Over this period of time, Craig also worked with other physicians in the College including Joseph Black (1728–1799) and John Robison (1739–1805) for the Calton Hill Observatory, John Hope (1725–1786), the botanist, for the Botanical Gardens and President Alexander Monro (1733–1817) to hand the hall to the College to use.\n\nThe rising cost of the building, partially due to wage strikes by journeymen in 1778 and 1779, led to disagreements between the College and Craig. It was never completed to the architect's satisfaction lacking it balustrade and statues on the exterior. Once built, the College considered offering it as the New Town Assembly Rooms for rent to recover costs, but decided to move in. By 1843 it was found to be inconvenient and was demolished that year, to be replaced by a banking hall by David Rhind (1808–1883).\n\nFrom 1774 to 1782 Craig worked on the Botanical Gardens which was the on Leith Walk. He produced plans for its entrance, greenhouses, gardener's cottage and several monuments. In 1778, he also oversaw the construction of Robert Adam's plan for the monument to Carl Linnaeus.\n\nElsewhere in Edinburgh, from 1778 to 1779 Craig planned the new hall of the Writers to the Signet, which had they been adopted, would have given the architect a new building project to follow immediately on from the Physicians Hall. He had some friends and patrons among lawyers, including enjoying the confidence of one the judges of the New Town plan, Lord Kames, and was an occasional social acquaintance with celebrated lawyer, James Boswell (1740–1795). Another prominent lawyer who was a patron was Robert Gray, Procurator Fiscal of Edinburgh. Craig prepared a site plan for him bearing the title, \"Plan of Mr Gray's property designed by James Craig\". It is undated but was once situated on Leith Walk nearby St James Square, which Craig also designed. In fact, such was the proximity of the house and square that Gray and the square's developer, the writer, Walter Ferguson, faced one another in the Court of Session in 1775 and again in 1791. These developments, including the plan Craig prepared for Leith Walk, which is again undated, shows that the architect was prepared to plan out new developments in and near Edinburgh. Lawyers Craig knew through their interests in property development such as, James Jollie, and representing architects and tradesmen in court, such as John Eiston, held land by the Walk which Craig's plan noted.\n\nOther less well known lawyers with whom he worked included property lawyers Walter Ferguson, James McQueen, in legal disputes, John Eiston and financing loans William McEwan and Samuel Watson. He continued to prepare layouts for new developments, including St James Square, to the east of the New Town, in 1773. Most of the square was demolished in the 1950s to make way for the St. James Centre shopping and office complex. Later, Craig prepared plans for new classrooms for the College of Edinburgh in 1781. The room was for Alexander Tytler (1747–1784), Professor of Universal History, and Allan Maconochie (1748–1816), Professor of Public Law.\n\nGiven Craig's own family link with the Presbyterian Church and Greyfriars Church in Edinburgh, he can be found working as an architect in churches. Such work was also a route to be considered for national government patronage via its close contact with the Assembly. In fact, his New Town plans showed new churches were a constantly in his thoughts, and the presence of Alexander Webster (1708–1784) on the project's administrative committees meant that the architect often worked closely with the Minister. But, it was in 1769 that he planned a new church for Dundee. Also north of the Firth of Forth, from 1773 to 1775, Craig planned to refurbish St Salvator's and St Leonard's College Chapels in St Andrews. He worked on the former.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1775 he planned and built a funerary monument for John Fullarton of Carberry inside St Michael's church, where Alexander Carlyle (1722–1805) was its Minister Inveresk.\n\nFrom 1775 to 1776, he planned the new seating plan for Kinghorn Parish Church in Fife; an exercise which he then returned to for the Edinburgh New Church in 1777. This New Church refurbishment would also have meant working with its Minister, Hugh Blair (1718–1800), who was also Professor of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh College. Given his connection with Dr Carlyle, and James Thomson, Blair may have warmed to Craig's obvious interests in literature and education with the architect drawn to the Moderate party of the Church of Scotland. As if to illustrate his commitment to Scottish literature, in 1788 Craig worked with Professor William Richardson (1743–1814) of Glasgow College and other Glaswegians and local me to erect a monument commemorating George Buchanan (1506–1582) at Killearn. Craig could not afford to subscribe money but offered to plan it for free. It was a large obelisk and won his wide media coverage and acclaim. \nIn later years, Craig prepared plans for new seating for South Leith Church from 1789 and 1793. In 1791, the architect claimed payment for plans he had made for Edinburgh's St Cuthbert's Church. The precise date of this work remains unknown but they probably related to work there from either 1773 to 1775, or in 1789 when a new steeple was put up.\n\nJames Craig worked on some engineering projects, which was a consequence of his work as an architect and the demand for improvements for trade, transport and industry. The Edinburgh north and south bridge projects have already been mentioned, and from 1777 to 1779 he and John Adam inspected building work by the north bridge for the Dean of Guild Court. Other work undertaken in 1777 which touched upon engineering included the Leith Ballast Quay. \nHowever, most of Craig's engineering projects appear to have proposed in the 1780s. Another bridge project he enquired about was the Bridge of Dun over the Esk for Montrose Town Council. Correspondence between the architect and Town Council's clerk was exchanged between 1783 and 1784. Other projects north of the Forth was Craig's survey and plan of May Island Lighthouse in 1786 for the newly established Chamber of Commerce. It decided against using Craig's proposed plans because there was no precedant for them. Later, Craig also proposed an improved Kirkcadly Harbour in 1788.\n\nAlthough Craig is best known for his urban architecture, he did also work on some country houses belonging to prestigious clients. Among these were proposed improvements to Mountstuart House for Earl Bute, for which Craig surveyed, and made plans from 1769 to 1770. Later, he also surveyed and planned Dalkeith Palace for the Duke of Buccleuch (1746–1812) in 1776, and in 1785 he surveyed and proposed improvements for Callender House which the businessman William Forbes of Callendar(1756–1823) had purchased. Although undated, Craig also worked at Hopetoun House to plan a new farm on its estate.\n\nSmaller scale projects for country houses included providing an elevation of Mountquhanie House in Fife in 1770 for John Gillespie, and from 1774 to 1775 Craig provided Noel Hill, 1st Lord Berwick, with a drawing of Tern Hall in Shropshire at a time when Hill proposed to convert it into Attingham Hall. This remains Craig's only known English house project although he travelled between England and Scotland many times. In 1790 he designed the stable block at Newhailes House in Musselburgh.\n\nCraig died at his house at West Bow of consumption (tuberculosis) in 1795. He was buried in the Craig family plot in northmost section of Greyfriars Kirkyard. At the time gravestones were only permitted on the perimeter wall of Greyfriars so no stone was permitted (a stone was later added). No record of who attended his funeral has been found but his death was widely reported in the British press typically commenting that the architect of the New Town and nephew of James Thomson has died. These facts were commonly reported again in subsequent press reports running into the next century.\n\nHe died in debt and his goods and books, drawings and equipment were sold at auction to pay creditors in the same year, with their matters for finally settled three years later. Craig was not the only architect or tradesman to have faced financial difficulties, but the commissary court's inventories of his possessions give a fascinating insight into his life and work. No copies of Coernelius Elliot's auction catalogues of Craig's goods and drawings are known to have survived.\n\nCraig was never able to fully capitalise on his success as the architect of the New Town. The management of the project did not lie with him, or any architect, but with Edinburgh Town Council. After 1767, and due to meeting its own financial commitments, the magistrates favoured builders rather than architects. Other causes of frustration were equally also out of his hands and these included political changes within Edinburgh Town Council. Given Craig's heyday was in the 1770s whenSir Lawrence Dundas (1710–1781) dominated Edinburgh, the fall of the Baronet from power after 1781, and the rise of the new regime under Henry Dundas (1742–1811) and the Duke of Buccleuch gave new architects and more builders opportunities to impress the city's leaders. By then, Craig had a reputation for being expensive, as per the Physicians Hall and Observatory, and headstrong in his criticism, as some of his existing letters indicate.\n\nBy 1782, his letters to his banker, and confidante, Sir William Forbes (1739–1806), indicate both his frustration at exclusion from work and need to raise money through loans. This need led him to raise loans from lawyers, merchants and others some of whom are listed by the commissary court in 1795. Fatally, such was his inability to replay loans quickly that he had his bank account arrested. For on 16 September 1791 the Town Council Alexander Dawson, a teller in the Royal Bank of Scotland, stopped Craig being paid £350 for work done for the city. The Commissary court records of 1795 indicate Craig had borrowed money from Dawson in 1786. This incident shows that he may have borrowed even more. Had the architect been able to keep his account and receive payment then he may have died without debt. Later critical reviews of his ability as an architect may have different as most focus on his shortcomings as a businessman. To date there is only one published assessment of his drawings or approach to design from sketch to final measured drawing.\n\nIf the first half of his career was a period when he did most in Edinburgh, the second half, from 1782 on, shows Craig moving around the country more. In 1787 he even wrote to James Boswell to enquire about moving to work in London. Despite being prepared to travel to work, his financial difficulties led to more frequent appearances in Edinburgh's courts either chasing unpaid bills or being chased for his own debts. Soon, it appears that cash in hand work was the best form of payment for Craig as his debtors circled his bank accounts. In theory, Craig offered Edinburgh town plans featuring circuses, an octagon, a crescent and squares. They were all features which broke what he himself called the \"monotony of the straight line\". Ironically, it is the grid plan of the New Town for which he is best known. The inventiveness of his town planning matched that of his plans for the Writers' Court and May Island Lighthouse and give reason for why he was known for ingenuity.\n\nCraig was buried in the Craig family plot. It was unmarked. The family was not known for its wealth and on death James' family line ended. He did, however, give it some fame from his work as an architect. Despite his occasional quarrelsome correspondence, commonly caused by non-payment or refusal to adhere to advice, Craig did have friends and allies. Dr William Cullen, Dugald Stewart (1753–1828), Lord Kames, Sir Alexander Dick of Prestonfield, Dr John Hope, James Boswell, Alexander Adam (1741–1809) and many more can be found on good terms with him and after death Craig's reputation as a being a respectable or eminent architect was not tarnished by his debts as when media reports appeared his work and relationship to Thomson was remembered. Legacies of his career today include monuments such as the Fullarton (Inveresk Church) and Buchanan monument (Killearn) as well as the New Town plans of Edinburgh and Glasgow where the grid of streets contrasts Craig's own interests in introducing circuses, octagons and other features to break the pattern up. James Begg was also his draughtsman and pupil who later became the architect of Edinburgh's Gayfield Square.\n\nDue to complex bans on monuments in Greyfriars' churchyard (not lifted until the late 19th century) the grave was only marked in the 1930s, then being done as part of half a dozen new memorials to notable persons by the Saltire Society. Subsequent celebrations of Craig and his work have been undertaken in Edinburgh through temporary museum exhibitions in 1967 and 1995, displaying his portrait and surviving mathematical instruments at Huntly House/Museum of Edinburgh, and numerous publications on the New Town with one, \"James Craig, 1744–1795,The Ingenious Architect of the New Town of Edinburgh\" (Mercat Press, 1995) being the only book of essays focussing on the architect.\n\n"}

His mother was Margrethe Pape, (1620–1684) who was made Baronesse of Løvendal by King Christian IV on September 15 that same year. When his father became King of Denmark in 1648, Ulrik Frederik assumed the surname Gyldenløve which was used by illegitimate sons of Danish kings.\n\nDuring the first half of the 1650s, he traveled in Europe, visiting France, Italy and Spain. He attended the University of Siena in 1654 and in Rome in 1655.\nOn August 21, 1655 he became a naturalised Danish noble.\n\nIn 1661, he was put in charge at Vordingborg and appointed commander Kalø Castle in Århus. \nIn 1657 he became colonel in Norway. Gyldenlove participated in the Dano-Swedish War (1658–1660), where he distinguished himself in the Battle of Nyborg on 14 November 1659.\nIn 1664 Gyldenløve was appointed viceroy (\"Statholder\") of Norway, replacing Iver Krabbe (1602- 1666). He studied conditions in Norway very carefully, and became a strong advocate for many important reforms, such as a simplified tax system and the establishment of a Court of appeals in Norway separate from the one in Denmark. He is also remembered for his role in the construction and improvement of nine fortresses along the Swedish border.\nGyldenløve took part in the 17th-century Dano-Swedish wars where he was particularly successful at the Battle of Nyborg on 14 November 1659. In 1666, he became commander-in-chief of the Norwegian army which was victorious in the Scanian Wars (1675–1679).\n\nGyldenløve implemented the reforms initiated by the prior Governor-general Hannibal Sehested (1609–1666) effecting taxation, defence and justice and protection for tenant farmers. He was also active in Danish politics from 1670 in association with Peder Griffenfeld (1635–1699) who served as Chancellor of Denmark.\n\nIn 1671, Gyldenløve founded the city of Laurvig (modern-day Larvik), and was named Count of Laurvig. In Larvik, he is remembered for the construction of Larvik Church (\"Larvik kirke\"), its main church as well as Laurvig Manor House (\"Laurvig Herregården\"), which is still one of the largest wooden structures in Norway. Larvik Church was inaugurated in 1677. Gyldenløve issued a gift to the church where the interest on the capital was to be used for maintenance. Laurvig Manor House was built beginning in 1674 and was completed for his third wedding with Antoinette Augusta von Aldenburg in 1677.\nThe site of Gyldenløve Chamber in Copenhagen, later to be known as Charlottenborg Palace (\"Charlottenborg Slot\"), was donated by King Christian V of Denmark to his half brother Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve on 22 March 1669 in connection with the establishment of Kongens Nytorv. Gyldenløve built his new mansion from 1672 to 1683 as the first building on the new square.\n\nCount Ulrik Frederik married thrice: Marie Grubbe (1643–1718) from whom he was divorced after nine years in 1670. He wed secondly, Sophie Urne (1629-1714), daughter of Jørgen Urne and Margrete Marsvin. His third wife was Countess Antoinette Augusta von Aldenburg (1660-1701), eldest daughter of Anton I, Count von Aldenburg und Knyphausen (by his first wife, Countess Auguste Johanna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein), legitimated son of Anton Gunther, who belonged to the Delmenhorst cadet branch of the House of Oldenburg whose senior line became hereditary kings of Denmark. Ulrik Frederik's two first marriages ended in divorces, but he has descendants from the second and third.\n\nHe had many children, both legitimate and illegitimate, four of whom lived to adulthood, married and left descendants:\n\nBy Sophie Urne:\n\nBy Countess Antoinette Augusta von Aldenburg:\n\nThrough his daughter, Charlotte Amalie, and her daughter, Countess Frederikke Louise af Danneskiold-Samsø , Ulrik Frederik became the ancestor of the Dukes of Augustenborg and thus, among others, of Frederick VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein and the German Empress Augusta.\n\n\n\n"}

The land was the site of an old gravel pit, and the ground was not built in time for the start of the 1910–11 season. As a result, the club played at the adjacent King's Park until moving into Dean Court in December 1910. However, the club facilities were still not ready, and players initially had to change in a nearby hotel. Early developments at the ground included a 300-seat stand.\n\nIn 1923, the club were elected to Division Three South of the Football League, at which point they changed their name to Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic. The first Football League match was played at Dean Court on 1 September 1923, with 7,000 watching a 0–0 draw with Swindon Town. Subsequent ground improvements were made following the purchase of fittings from the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, which allowed the construction of a 3,700-seat stand. A covered terrace was added at the southern end of the ground in 1936.\n\nThe club's record League attendance was set on 14 April 1948, when 25,495 watched a 1–0 defeat to QPR. The overall record attendance was set on 2 March 1957, when 28,799 spectators watched an FA Cup match against Manchester United. Shortly afterwards, a roof was added to the western stand. The club also purchased more land behind the northern end of the ground, with the intention of enlarging the stand and building a leisure centre. However, the club ran out of money during its construction and abandoned the scheme in 1984. As a result, the half-built structure was demolished and housing was built on that part of the site. The club's lowest Football League attendance was set on 4 March 1986, when only 1,873 saw a 2–2 drawn with Lincoln City.\n\nThe ground was completely rebuilt in 2001, with the pitch rotated ninety degrees from its original position and the ground moved away from adjacent housing. Because the work was not finished in time for the start of the 2001–02 season, Bournemouth played their first eight games at the Avenue Stadium in nearby Dorchester. When Dean Court reopened with a game against Wrexham on 10 November, it gained its first sponsored name, becoming the Fitness First Stadium. Although it was rebuilt as a three sided stadium with a capacity of 9,600, seats were placed on the undeveloped south end in the autumn of 2005. On 24 February 2004 Bournemouth's James Hayter scored the Football League's fastest-ever hat-trick at Dean Court, scoring three goals in 2 minutes and 20 seconds during a 6–0 victory over Wrexham. The club sold the stadium in December 2005 in a sale-and-leaseback deal with London property company Structadene.\n\nIn the 2010–11 a temporary south stand was built, but was removed during the 2011–12 season after attendances fell. In July 2011 the stadium was renamed the Seward Stadium after the naming rights were sold to the Seward Motor Group. Following Seward entering administration in February 2012, the ground was subsequently renamed the Goldsands Stadium in a two-year deal. During the summer of 2013 a 2,400 seat stand was built on the undeveloped end of the ground as a result of the club's promotion to the Championship. In July 2013 it was named after former club striker Ted MacDougall.\n\nIn August 2014, chairman Jeff Mostyn revealed that the club were looking at the possibility of redeveloping the stadium rather than moving to Matchams. With a limited capacity of 11,464, the club were exploring the option of building a new, permanent stand and filling-in the stadium's corners should they continue to be successful in the Premier League. The naming rights changed once more in July 2015 when the stadium became the Vitality Stadium. \n\nIn May 2016, Bournemouth announced that they will not be adding new capacity to its ground in time for the next Premier League season. The club has taken the decision to delay redevelopment plans following a meeting of its board. A statement from the Cherries blamed \"ongoing negotiations with the club's landlord to purchase the stadium\". The club had previously said improving the stadium's size was needed as \"demand for tickets far outweighs our current capacity\". Dean Court remains the smallest ground in the Premier League.\n\nIn December 2016 the club announced plans to find a new site due to the ongoing issues regarding ownership of the ground.\n\nIn July 2017 the club confirmed it was looking to build a new stadium near the current site in Kings Park.\n\nIn 2013 both England Ladies and Under 16 sides played games at the ground. The stadium has also been used for music concerts, hosting Elton John in 2006.\n\n"}

A furthering of the theory of quadratic forms, he stated the problem as follows:\n\nAs stated by Kaplansky, \"The 11th Problem is simply this: classify quadratic forms over algebraic number fields.\" This is exactly what Minkowski did for quadratic form with fractional coefficients. A quadratic form (not quadratic equation) is any polynomial in which each term has variables appearing exactly twice. The general form of such an equation is \"ax\" + \"bxy\" + \"cy\". (All coefficients must be whole numbers.)\n\nA given quadratic form is said to \"represent\" a natural number if substituting specific numbers for the variables gives the number. Gauss and those who followed found that if we change variables in certain ways, the new quadratic form represented the same natural numbers as the old, but in a different, more easily interpreted form. He used this theory of equivalent quadratic forms to prove number theory results. Lagrange, for example, had shown that any natural number can be expressed as the sum of four squares. Gauss proved this using his theory of equivalence relations by showing that the quadratic formula_1 represents all natural numbers. As mentioned earlier, Minkowski created and proved a similar theory for quadratic forms that had fractions as coefficients. Hilbert's eleventh problem asks for a similar theory. That is, a mode of classification so we can tell if one form is equivalent to another, but in the case where coefficients can be algebraic numbers. Helmut Hasse's accomplished this in a proof using his local-global principle and the fact that the theory is relatively simple for \"p\"-adic systems in October 1920. He published his work in 1923 and 1924. See Hasse principle, Hasse-Minkowski theorem. The local-global principle says that a general result about a rational number or even all rational numbers can often be established by verifying that the result holds true for each of the \"p\"-adic number systems.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1821658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821658", "title": "Richard E. Morgan", "text": "Richard E. Morgan\n\nRichard Ernest \"Dick\" Morgan (May 17, 1937 – November 13, 2014) was a conservative author, contributing editor of \"City Journal\", and the William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Government at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, United States. His areas of academic interest included the history, law and politics of the First Amendment. At the time of his death, Morgan was one of the leading conservatives of his generation.\n\nIn a speech and debate with Mark Tushnet before the James Madison Memorial Fellowship in July 2000, he outlined what he considered the greatest challenge facing America: judicial supremacy. By examining New Hampshire political culture from the 18th century through the 1990s, he explained what he thought was at stake in debates about the financing of public schools. He argued that the role of the courts in restructuring school funding away from an older \"New Hampshire model\" was more of a challenge to traditions of republican self-government than most acknowledged.\n\nA strong proponent of a locally funded tax structure for public schools and other measures often characterized as \"school privatization\", Morgan grounded his arguments in a series of essays for \"City Journal\" in the 1990s. First, he argued that the segregationist reaction to \"Brown v. Board\" in 1954 (a reaction he disparaged) gave resistance to judicial over-reaching a bad name in general. In an important 1996 essay, \"Coming Clean About Brown\", Morgan recommended overturning \"Brown v. Board\". Second, he did not accept the idea that the government should take direct action to foster racial integration.\n\nIn addition, he, along with his wife Jean Yarbrough, was a strong proponent of the study of the American founders. In his teaching, he sought to nourish a variety of views \"hinged\" by the Constitution. One of Morgan's most important works, \"Disabling America: The Rights Industry in Our Time\" (1984), is in part an extended refutation of Ronald Dworkin's \"Taking Rights Seriously\" (1977). Through several essays during the Reagan-Rehnquist period of American political and judicial history, Morgan helped to theorize the intellectual basis of colorblind constitutionalism as an antidote to the kind of argument made by Dworkin.\n\nDworkin's book, which appeared at about the same time as his important November 1977 essay \"Why Bakke Has No Case\" in the NYRB, grounded a form of jurisprudence consistent with the affirmative action decision in \"University of California Regents v. Bakke\". Morgan considered Dworkin \"one of the most prolific and one of the most audacious theoreticians of rights and liberties writing today.\" His counter-argument to Dworkin and others on affirmative action was spelled out in an essay, \"Negating Affirmative Action\".\n\n\"Across the country, it's beginning to sink in that programs and practices sold as temporary remedies are on their way to becoming permanent features of the American landscape. This situation is untenable, since the majority of Americans agree that non-discriminating colorblindness is the only truly just principle, even though the elites may disagree.\"\n\nWithin conservative circles, Morgan is known for his attempt to re-unite different branches of the American conservative coalition after the First Things coalition began falling apart. Father Richard John Neuhaus had claimed that the judicial overreaching of recent decades amounts to a \"usurpation of politics\" which warranted radical resistance to the American government. Morgan, in his writings during the following decade, tried to mend the fallout between Father Neuhaus and those who had left the board—Gertrude Himmelfarb, Walter Berns, and Peter Berger—by encouraging those on both sides of the divide to focus on the problem of \"judicial supremacy\".\n\nMorgan was particularly worried about interpretations of this controversy that heightened the divide between Christians and Jews within the conservative fold. In the essay, Morgan wrote,\n\n\"we are most effective in opposing judicial activism precisely when we invoke the American constitutional tradition itself— when we speak in the idiom of The Federalist, Jefferson, and Lincoln—not when we stand outside it.\"\n\nHis important essay with Jean Yarbrough, \"Why the Founding Is Back in Fashion\" (1999), can also be seen as an attempt to mend the intra-conservative divide that emerged in the wake of First Things' \"End of Democracy?\" symposium. In the essay, Morgan and Yarbrough try to give an account of what those on both sides of the First Things controversy should hold in common—a restoration of the role that virtue and character played in the writings of the American founders. Morgan argued that those trying to carry on a tradition of local, republican self-government should focus on safeguarding the \"institutions—ranging from the family, the farm, and the schools all the way up to organized religions... that shape a distinctive American character.\"\n\nMorgan held an A.B. degree from Bowdoin College (1959) and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University. He joined the Bowdoin faculty in 1969 after one year as a Fellow in Law and Government at Harvard Law School. Morgan served as the chair of Bowdoin's Government Department three times—from 1969-1975, from 1983–85, and from 1992-94.\n\nAuthored, co-authored or edited:\n\n"}

{"id": "1821662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821662", "title": "Viva Ned Flanders", "text": "Viva Ned Flanders\n\n\"Viva Ned Flanders\" is the tenth episode of \"The Simpsons\" tenth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 10, 1999. In the episode, Ned Flanders, who is revealed to be 60 years old, feels that he has not lived his life to the fullest. He asks for help from his neighbor, Homer Simpson, who takes Ned to Las Vegas to show him \"the right way to live\". However, while there, the two become intoxicated and accidentally marry two cocktail waitresses.\n\nThe episode was written by David M. Stern and directed by Neil Affleck. The revelation of Ned's age was heavily debated between the \"Simpsons\" staff, and the decision to make him 60 years old could have been inspired from a joke by \"Simpsons\" writer Ron Hauge. A scene in the episode features the song \"Viva Las Vegas\" by Elvis Presley, although the staff originally wanted a version of the song performed by Bruce Springsteen. The Moody Blues guest-starred as themselves in the episode, and the episode marked the first appearance of the cocktail waitresses Amber and Ginger, who were voiced by Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille respectively.\n\nThe episode was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour) in 1999, which it ultimately lost to \"King of the Hill\". Following the tenth season's release on DVD, the episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. Amber and Ginger have appeared in later episodes in the series, the first time being the season 13 episode \"Brawl in the Family\", which serves as a continuation of \"Viva Ned Flanders\".\n\nMr. Burns' Casino is about to get demolished; however, confusion over whether demolitions are supposed to involve implosions or explosions results in the casino being blasted into a huge dust cloud. The family goes to the car wash to get rid of the dust, and when Homer is there, he sees that Ned Flanders gets a senior discount. Homer thinks Ned is lying and tries to expose him at church, but Ned proves he really is sixty years old. People are impressed that Ned looks so young for his age and remark that he must take exceptional care of himself, but when Ned says that he follows the three \"c\"s of success—clean living, chewing thoroughly, and \"a daily dose of vitamin Church!\"—they start to pity him for having never, in their view, truly lived at all.\n\nNed reluctantly agrees with this and asks Homer to teach him the secret to his lust for life. This leads Homer to head towards Mr. Burns' Casino, but when Ned reminds Homer it is now defunct, Homer instead takes Ned on a gambling trip to Las Vegas. Homer is confident about going there, but Flanders is nervous. When they arrive, they see Captain Lance Murdock (from \"Bart the Daredevil\") doing one of his stunts, and Homer chooses to volunteer, and survives (although Murdock is again badly injured). They wander into a casino called \"Nero's Palace\" and begin to play roulette. Ned protests against games of chance because of Deuteronomy 7, but Homer ignores him and takes the reference as a lucky number. They win, but immediately lose all they won. They then go to the casino's bar, and Ned gives into temptation and gets drunk on wine spritzers. Homer and Ned wake up the next morning in their hotel room married to two cocktail waitresses: Homer's new wife is named Amber, and Ned's new wife is Ginger. Homer finally realizes he got in over his head. While Homer fantasizes about bigamy, Ned snaps Homer back to reality by saying they were drunk and thus not of sound judgement to have such quick weddings; while also being married.\n\nHomer and Ned try to escape from the waitresses, going on a wild rampage through the casino, until they are confronted by casino security, Gunter and Ernst (also from \"$pringfield\"), Drederick Tatum, Boomhauer, and the Moody Blues. Homer and Ned attempt to escape in a car, but are beaten up in the process and are exiled from Las Vegas, with Amber and Ginger quickly leaving them for Gunter and Ernst. Homer and Ned head back to their real wives in Springfield by hitchhiking, only to be attacked by two hungry vultures on their way back, being heard screaming as the credits roll.\n\n\"Viva Ned Flanders\" was written by writer David M. Stern and directed by director Neil Affleck. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on January 10, 1999. It was recorded in July 1998.\n\nThe beginning of the episode shows Mr. Burns' casino being demolished with explosion. In the DVD commentary for the episode, show runner Mike Scully stated that there was \"a lot of talk\" and news reports about implosions at the time. Only directly after the implosion do the on-lookers realize the amount of dust that is unleashed. This is based on an observation by the writers, who noted that, when an implosion takes place, \"everybody wants to be right next to them\", not realizing that dust and asbestos will \"fly in the air\". In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, director Affleck stated that the scene was very complicated to animate, and took about \"four or five takes\" to get right. Scully thought that the explosion looked \"fantastic\".\n\nThe revelation of Ned's age was much discussed among the writers, and Scully stated that they argued over \"how old they could get away with\", since Ned had \"lived such a pure life\" and had \"taken such good care of himself\". The writers kept pitching for him to be older and older, eventually debating whether his age would be 57 or 58. They then decided on 60, an idea that could have come from Ron Hauge, one of the \"Simpsons\" writers. A few weeks before the discussions, after having found out that he was slightly older than the next oldest writer in the staff, Hauge had told one of the writers, in \"the most serious reasonable\" voice, that he was 60 years old. At the time, Hauge was \"around 40\" years old.\n\nThe morning after having drunk extensively, Homer and Ned are seen sleeping, clothed, in a Jacuzzi. The staff discussed whether or not the two should wake up naked or clothed; series creator Matt Groening, for example, wanted them to wake up naked, since it would \"raise some questions\". During production, Affleck had drawn an alternate version of the scene, which would be based on his \"extensive experience in the field of alcohol abuse\" in his younger years. The scene would be in Ned's point of view, and would show Homer's open mouth half submerged in the Jacuzzi. Affleck described the alternate scene as being \"a little bit Fellini-esque\" and therefore did not fit with \"The Simpsons\" style. Scully had also suggested that Ned would throw up on screen at the end of the scene, however the idea never came to fruition.\n\nThe song used during the chase scene in the casino is \"Viva Las Vegas\", performed by Elvis Presley. Although he admitted that he has \"nothing against Elvis\", Scully originally wanted to use a \"hard to find\" version of the song performed by Bruce Springsteen. However, Scully could not clear the version in time, and therefore had to resort to using Elvis' version of the song. The episode features The Moody Blues as themselves. Scully commented that they were \"very good actors\" and \"did a great job\". The episode also features the first appearance of Amber and Ginger, who were voiced by Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille respectively. Real-life commentator Don Rickles and fictional character Lance Murdock were both portrayed by series regular voice actor Dan Castellaneta, who plays Homer among many others in the series.\n\nAffleck described the plot of the episode to have a \"grotesque\" and \"burlesque\", yet \"plausible\" quality to it. In a scene in the episode, Homer, not knowing of Ned's age, accuses Ned of defrauding a carwash salesman. Affleck commented that the scene has \"a touch of music-hall\" in it, as it turns, from a scene in church, to a \"courtroom scene\". He also noted that Ned's journey to Las Vegas can be compared to a Christian's travel to the temple of Mammon, a figure that in the Bible is characterized as the personification of wealth and greed.\n\nThe episode's title is a reference to the film \"Viva Las Vegas\" (1964). The panic and smoke cloud generated from the implosion of Mr Burns' casino is reminiscent of the 1997 disaster film \"Dante's Peak\", and the Simpson family's escape from the smoke cloud is a reference to a scene in the 1996 science fiction film \"Independence Day\". Outside Rev. Lovejoy's church is a notice that today's sermon will be 'He Knows What You Did Last Summer', which is a reference to the title of the 1997 slasher film \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\". As Homer and Ned escape from Vegas, a snippet of the theme from the 1996 comic science fiction film \"Mars Attacks!\" can be heard. The Comic Book Guy's license plate is NCC-1701, which is also the registration of the USS Enterprise, a fictional starship from the \"Star Trek\" media franchise. He also has a bumper sticker which reads \"my other car is the \"Millennium Falcon\"\" which was given to him by somebody who looked like the actor Harrison Ford; the \"Millennium Falcon\" was the ship used by Ford's character Han Solo in the \"Star Wars\" film series. The line Homer gives after Ned signs the contract is a reference to the 1997 film The Game.\n\nThe song Homer and Ned listen to on the way to Las Vegas is “Highway Star” by English rock band Deep Purple. The two characters driving the other way from Las Vegas were based on Ralph Steadman's illustrations of Raoul Duke and his attorney Dr Gonzo from the novel \"\", written by Hunter S. Thompson. The reference was contributed by \"Simpsons\" writer George Meyer, who stated that, since Homer and Ned were driving to Las Vegas, \"we [the \"Simpsons\" writers] had to do a Ralph Steadman tribute. In the wedding video, Homer is seen wearing an attire similar to the ones worn by the Rat Pack members.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on January 10, 1999, \"Viva Ned Flanders\" received an 11.6 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 11.5 million viewers. The same year, the episode was nominated for an Emmy award in the category of animated programming less than one hour, but it ultimately lost to the \"King of the Hill\" episode \"And They Call It Bobby Love\". On August 7, 2007, the episode was released as part of \"The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD set.\n\nFollowing its home video release, \"Viva Ned Flanders\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ian Jane of DVD Talk wrote that the episode is a \"classic\", and Jake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News found it to be one of the better episodes of the season. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that even though he found Ned being 60 years old \"absurd\", the episode \"musters plenty of fine laughs\". He especially liked Homer's escapades, as well as the scenes in Vegas. He concluded his review by writing that \"now it’s Marge’s time to shine!\" is one of his favorite lines of the series.\n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", were also positive, commenting that the episode is \"one of the fastest paced episodes ever\", and \"moves at breathless speed\". They added that it is \"enormous fun with more bizarre moments than you can shake a stick at\", particularly praising a scene involving \"a hysterical Joan Rivers\". Mac MacEntire of DVD Verdict wrote that the establishing shots in Vegas were the episode's highlights. Aaron Roxby of Collider thought negatively of the episode however, writing that, even though the episode has \"some decent gags\", it is overall \"one of the weaker Flanders based episodes\".\n\nSimilarities have been noted on multiple occasions between this episode and the 2009 film \"The Hangover\", particularly in the inclusion of plot devices such as intoxicated, unexpected marriage and the protagonists meeting an iconic boxer, as well as featuring a massive suite at Caesar's Palace (or \"Nero's Palace\" in \"The Simpsons\").\nAmber and Ginger would re-appear in later episodes of the series. They first returned in the season 13 episode \"Brawl in the Family\", in which they track down Homer and Ned. In the DVD commentary for said episode, current show runner Al Jean praised \"Viva Ned Flanders\", but stated that he thought the ending was \"loose\". He said, \"Usually, like, if you leave a wife like, in Vegas, they track you down\". \"Brawl in the Family\" was produced to \"resolve\" the ending to \"Viva Ned Flanders\".

As a Commissioner (Judge) at the trial of King Charles I, he signed the king's death warrant but was one of the few regicides to be pardoned.\n\nRichard Ingoldsby was the second son of Sir Richard Ingoldsby K.B. of Lethenborough in Buckinghamshire and Elizabeth, the daughter of Sir Oliver Cromwell of Hinchingbrooke, Huntingdon (the uncle and godfather of Oliver Cromwell the Lord Protector). This meant that Ingoldsby was a cousin of the Lord Protector. He was educated at Lord Williams's School in Thame, Oxfordshire. He had four sisters and seven brothers, including the oldest, Francis Ingoldsby, and Sir Henry Ingoldsby, 1st Baronet.\n\nDuring the English Civil War he joined John Hampden's regiment as a Captain and followed Oliver Cromwell into the New Model Army where he served as Colonel. He was detached by Sir Thomas Fairfax in May 1645 to relieve Taunton. He took part in the western campaign and was involved in the capture of Bristol and Bridgewater. His regiment garrisoned Oxford when it surrendered in 1646. In the quarrel between the parliament and the army in 1647 Ingoldsby's regiment took the army's part with the army. The regiment was ordered to be disbanded on 14 June, and money was sent to pay it off. The money was recalled by subsequent vote, but it had already reached Oxford, and the soldiers forcibly took it and routed the escorting troops. Ingoldsby's regiment also petitioned against the Treaty of Newport and in favor of punishing the King. On 4 October 1647 Ingoldsby was elected Member of Parliament (M.P.) for Wendover in the Long Parliament. Ingoldsby himself was appointed one of the King's judges, which ended in his signing the death-warrant, although there is no evidence that he was present at any of previous court sessions. In 1649 his regiment was one of the regiments which supported the Bishopsgate mutiny and for a time he was held prisoner by his own men. Some Levellers, notably Col. William Eyres, were imprisoned in Oxford after the Banbury mutiny, and contrived to inspire a second mutiny in the garrison, although it was quickly suppressed by Ingoldsby and others, and two of the ring-leaders were shot in Broken Hayes. In May 1651 Ingoldsby's regiment left Oxford and joined the army which fought at the Battle of Worcester the last battle of the English Civil War.\n\nIngoldsby was chosen one of the Council of State in November 1652. He was elected MP for Buckinghamshire in 1654 for the First Protectorate Parliament and 1656 for the Second Protectorate Parliament. He sat in the second house of Parliament commonly known as Cromwell's Other House in 1657–1659. When Oliver Cromwell died in 1659, Ingoldsby supported Richard Cromwell as Lord Protector when the officers of the army began to agitate against Richard Cromwell. Ingoldsby vigorously supported the new Protector, who was his own kinsman, but after the Rump Parliament removed Richard he threw in his lot with General George Monck and the move towards the restoration of the English monarchy. Seeing the Restoration at hand, he entered into negotiation with the agents of Charles II. As he was a regicide, the King refused to promise him indemnity, and left him to earn a pardon by his good services. In the struggle between Parliament and the army he energetically backed Parliament, and on 28 December 1659 he received its thanks for seizing Windsor Castle. Monck appointed him to command Colonel Rich's regiment (February 1660), and sent him to suppress John Lambert's intended rising (18 April 1660). Lambert had escaped from the Tower where General George Monck had imprisoned him, and had tried to raise the supporters of the Good Old Cause in a last-ditch attempt to stop the English Restoration in 1660. On 22 April Ingoldsby met Lambert's forces near Daventry, arrested him as he tried to flee, and brought him in triumph to London. Ingoldsby was thanked by the House of Commons on 26 April 1660. He was elected Member of Parliament for the constituency of Aylesbury in early 1660 in the Convention Parliament.\n\nAfter the Restoration Ingoldsby was pardoned for his regicide, firstly for his activities in support of General Monck, and secondly because he pleaded that he had been forced to sign the death warrant by his cousin Oliver Cromwell, in that \"\"he refused but Cromwell and the others held him by violence; and Cromwell, with a loud laugh, taking his hand in his, and putting the pen between his fingers, with his own hand wrote Richard Ingoldsby\"\". He was not only spared the punishment which befell the rest of the regicides, but was created a Knight of the Bath at the coronation of Charles II on 20 April 1661. He was re-elected MP for Aylesbury in the Cavalier Parliament and held the seat until 1685.\n\nIngoldsby died in 1685 and was buried in Hartwell Church, Buckinghamshire, on 16 September 1685. He had married Elizabeth Lee, second daughter of Sir George Croke of Waterstock, Oxfordshire, and widow of Thomas Lee of Hartwell. Richard Ingoldsby, commander of the Army in Ireland, was his nephew.\n\n\n \n"}

Bum Rush the Show is the debut studio album by American hip hop group Public Enemy, released on February 10, 1987. It was recorded at Spectrum City Studios in Hempstead, New York, and became one of the fastest-selling hip hop records, but was controversial among radio stations and critics, in part due to lead rapper Chuck D's black nationalist politics. Despite this, the album has since been regarded as one of hip hop's greatest and most influential records.\n\n\"Yo! Bum Rush the Show\" debuts The Bomb Squad's sample-heavy production style, which is prominent on the group's following work. Joe Brown of \"The Washington Post\" described the album's music as \"a more serious brand of inner-city aggression\", in comparison to \"Licensed to Ill\" (1986) by Def Jam label-mates the Beastie Boys. On its musical style, Brown wrote \"Public Enemy's mean and minimalist rap is marked by an absolute absence of melody – the scary sound is just a throbbing pulse, hard drums and a designed-to-irritate electronic whine, like a dentist's drill or a persistent mosquito\". The album's sound is accented by the scratching of DJ Terminator X. \"Chicago Tribune\" writer Daniel Brogan described Public Enemy's style on the album as \"raw and confrontational\", writing that the group \"doesn't aim to – or have a chance at – crossing over\". \n\nAccording to music journalist Jeff Chang, Public Enemy embodied the \"bumrush aesthetic\" of underground black radicalism and used their debut album's cover to illustrate a resurgence in the spirit of militancy. The cover features the group in a poorly lit basement, \"readying themselves to bring black militancy back into the high noon of the Reagan day\", as Chang described and compared to the 1987 Boogie Down Productions album \"Criminal Minded\" that followed. Chuck D is shown dressed in white Islamic clothing, Professor Griff is on the far right wearing a red beret, and Flavor Flav has his hand reaching out over a turntable, which Chang interpreted as him blessing the vinyl record. A second black hand is shown reaching at the play button to \"begin the revolution\", in Chang's words. A line of repeated text is printed at the bottom of the photo, described by Chang as a punchline, and reading: \"THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBLE . . . THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBLE . . . THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBLE . . .\" The cover marked the first appearance of Public Enemy's logo, a silhouette of a black man in a rifle's crosshairs.\n\n\"Yo! Bum Rush the Show\" was released on February 10, 1987, by Def Jam Recordings and Columbia Records. It was promoted with the release of two singles that year: \"Public Enemy No. 1\" in March and \"You're Gonna Get Yours\" in May. \n\nThe album was largely ignored by radio programmers, including most African-American radio stations. On record charts, it reached the 125th position of the \"Billboard\" Top LPs and number 28 on the Top Black Albums in the United States. Jon Pareles reported in May 1987, however, that it had become one of hip hop's fastest selling records. By the following year, it had sold more than 300,000 copies in the US, and 400,000 by 1989. On October 3, 1994, the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, indicating 500,000 units moved.\n\nAccording to Robert Hilburn in 1988, \"Yo! Bum Rush the Show\" was widely acclaimed by critics. However, fellow music journalist Christopher R. Weingarten later recalled American critics were originally lukewarm to the album. In Chang's estimation, white journalists in particular strongly criticized Chuck D's pro-black nationalist sentiments. \n\nIn a review published in \"The Village Voice\" under the title \"Noise Annoys\", John Leland avoided the group's politics entirely and simply found Chuck D boring, instead preferring the more entertaining rhymes of Flavor Flav. Fellow \"Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau said the group has \"literary chops—amid puns more Elvis Costello than Peter Tosh, their 'Megablast' is cutting anticrack narrative-propaganda--and they make something personal of rap's ranking minimalist groove.\" He found them lacking in levity, however, and complained that \"Chuck D takes the bully-boy orotundity of his school of rap elocution into a realm of vocal self-involvement worthy of Pavarotti, Steve Perry, or the preacher at a Richard Pryor funeral.\" Pareles was more enthusiastic in \"The New York Times\", hailing \"Yo! Bum Rush the Show\" as rap's \"grittiest\" full-length record. While still finding Public Enemy plagued by the immature machismo prevalent in the genre, the journalist said its songs are \"far more convincing - and unsettling - when [Chuck] D takes on money and power\", and concluded: \"At a time when most rappers typecast themselves as comedy acts or party bands, Public Enemy's best moments promise something far more dangerous and subversive: realism.\"\n\nAccording to Chang, the album fared better among critics in the United Kingdom, where music publications ranked it as one of the year's best records. In \"NME\" magazine's critics poll, it was named the best album of 1987. It was also voted the 14th best album of the year in \"The Village Voice\"s Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide. \n\nIn subsequent years, \"Yo! Bum Rush the Show\" has been considered a classic and one of hip hop's most influential records. In 1998, it was selected as one of \"The Source\"s 100 Best Rap Albums. The single \"Saturday Night\" was also listed at number 28 on their list of Top 50 tracks of the year. In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it number 497 on a list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, but the album was dropped from the 2012 list.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1821689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821689", "title": "Specific rotation", "text": "Specific rotation\n\nIn chemistry, specific rotation ([α]) is a property of a chiral chemical compound. It is defined as the change in orientation of monochromatic plane-polarized light, per unit distance–concentration product, as the light passes through a sample of a compound in solution. Compounds which rotate the plane of polarization of a beam of plane polarized light clockwise are said to be dextrorotary, and correspond with positive specific rotation values, while compounds which rotate the plane of polarization of plane polarized light counterclockwise are said to be levorotary, and correspond with negative values. If a compound is able to rotate the plane of polarization of plane-polarized light, it is said to be “optically active”.\n\nSpecific rotation is an intensive property, distinguishing it from the more general phenomenon of optical rotation. As such, the \"observed\" rotation (α) of a sample of a compound can be used to quantify the enantiomeric excess of that compound, provided that the \"specific\" rotation ([α]) for the enantiopure compound is known. The variance of specific rotation with wavelength—a phenomenon known as optical rotatory dispersion—can be used to find the absolute configuration of a molecule. The concentration of bulk sugar solutions is sometimes determined by comparison of the observed optical rotation with the known specific rotation.\n\nThe CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics defines specific rotation as:\n\nFor an optically active substance, defined by [α] = α/γl, where α is the angle through which plane polarized light is rotated by a solution of mass concentration γ and path length l. Here θ is the Celsius temperature and λ the wavelength of the light at which the measurement is carried out.\n\nValues for specific rotation are reported in units of deg·mL·g·dm, which are typically shortened to just degrees, wherein the other components of the unit are tacitly assumed. These values should always be accompanied by information about the temperature, solvent and wavelength of light used, as all of these variables can affect the specific rotation. As noted above, temperature and wavelength are frequently reported as a superscript and subscript, respectively, while the solvent is reported parenthetically, or omitted if it happens to be water.\n\nOptical rotation is measured with an instrument called a polarimeter. There is a linear relationship between the observed rotation and the concentration of optically active compound in the sample. There is a nonlinear relationship between the observed rotation and the wavelength of light used. Specific rotation is calculated using either of two equations, depending on whether the sample is a pure chemical to be tested or that chemical dissolved in solution.\n\nThis equation is used:\n\nIn this equation, α (Greek letter \"alpha\") is the measured rotation in degrees, \"l\" is the path length in decimeters, and \"ρ\" (Greek letter \"rho\") is the density of the liquid in g/mL, for a sample at a temperature \"T\" (given in degrees Celsius) and wavelength \"λ\" (in nanometers). If the wavelength of the light used is 589 nanometers (the sodium D line), the symbol “D” is used. The sign of the rotation (+ or −) is always given.\n\nFor solutions, a slightly different equation is used:\n\nIn this equation, α (Greek letter \"alpha\") is the measured rotation in degrees, \"l\" is the path length in decimeters, \"c\" is the concentration in g/mL, \"T\" is the temperature at which the measurement was taken (in degrees Celsius), and \"λ\" is the wavelength in nanometers.\n\nFor practical and historical reasons, concentrations are often reported in units of g/100mL. In this case, a correction factor in the numerator is necessary:\n\nWhen using this equation, the concentration and the solvent may be provided in parentheses after the rotation. The rotation is reported using degrees, and no units of concentration are given (it is assumed to be g/100mL). The sign of the rotation (+ or −) is always given. If the wavelength of the light used is 589 nanometer (the sodium D line), the symbol “D” is used. If the temperature is omitted, it is assumed to be at standard room temperature (20 °C).\n\nFor example, the specific rotation of a compound would be reported in the scientific literature as:\n\nIf a compound has a very large specific rotation or a sample is very concentrated, the actual rotation of the sample may be larger than 180°, and so a single polarimeter measurement cannot detect when this has happened (for example, the values +270° and −90° are not distinguishable, nor are the values 361° and 1°). In these cases, measuring the rotation at several different concentrations allows one to determine the true value. Another method would be to use shorter path-lengths to perform the measurements.\n\nIn cases of very small or very large angles, one can also use the variation of specific rotation with wavelength to facilitate measurement. Switching wavelength is particularly useful when the angle is small. Many polarimeters are equipped with a mercury lamp (in addition to the sodium lamp) for this purpose.\n\nIf the specific rotation, formula_6 of a pure chiral compound is known, it is possible to use the observed specific rotation, formula_7 to determine the enantiomeric excess (\"ee\"), or \"optical purity\", of a sample of the compound, by using the formula:\n\nFor example, if a sample of bromobutane measured under standard conditions has an observed specific rotation of −9.2°, this indicates that the net effect is due to (9.2°/23.1°)(100%) = 40% of the R enantiomer. The remainder of the sample is a racemic mixture of the enantiomers (30% R and 30% S), which has no net contribution to the observed rotation. The enantiomeric excess is 40%; the total concentration of R is 70%.\n\nHowever, in practice the utility of this method is limited, as the presence of small amounts of highly rotating impurities can greatly affect the rotation of a given sample. Moreover, the optical rotation of a compound may be non-linearly dependent on its enantiomeric excess because of aggregation in solution. For these reasons other methods of determining the enantiomeric ratio, such as gas chromatography or HPLC with a chiral column, are generally preferred.\n\nThe variation of specific rotation with wavelength is called optical rotatory dispersion (ORD). ORD can be used in conjunction with computational methods to determine the absolute configuration of certain compounds.\n"}

The vast majority of these mountains are located on the edge of the Indian and Eurasian continental plates. Only those summits are included that, by an objective measure, may be considered individual mountains as opposed to subsidiary peaks.\n\nThe dividing line between a mountain with multiple peaks and separate mountains is not always clear (see also Highest unclimbed mountain). A popular and intuitive way to distinguish mountains from subsidiary peaks is by their height above the highest saddle connecting it to a higher summit, a measure called topographic prominence or re-ascent (the higher summit is called the \"parent peak\"). A common definition of a mountain is a summit with prominence. Alternatively, a relative prominence (prominence/height) is used (usually 7–8%) to reflect that in higher mountain ranges everything is on a larger scale. The table below lists the highest 100 summits with at least prominence, approximating a 7% relative prominence. A drawback of a prominence-based list is that it may exclude well-known or spectacular mountains that are connected via a high ridge to a taller summit, such as Eiger or Nuptse. A few such peaks and mountains with nearly sufficient prominence are included but not numbered in this list.\n\nIt is very unlikely that all given heights are correct to the nearest metre; indeed, the sea level is often problematic to define when a mountain is remote from the sea. Different sources often differ by many metres, and the heights given below may well differ from those elsewhere in this encyclopedia. As an extreme example, Ulugh Muztagh on the north Tibetan Plateau is often listed as to , but appears to be only to . Some mountains differ by > on different maps, while even very thorough current measurements of Mount Everest range from to . These discrepancies serve to emphasize the uncertainties in the listed heights.\n\nThough some parts of the world, especially the most mountainous parts, have never been thoroughly mapped, it is unlikely that any mountains this high have been overlooked, because synthetic aperture radar can and has been used to measure elevations of most otherwise inaccessible places. Still, heights or prominences may be revised, so that the order of the list may change and even \"new\" mountains could enter the list over time. To be safe, the list has been extended to include all peaks.\n\nThe highest mountains above sea level are generally not the highest above the surrounding terrain. There is no precise definition of surrounding base, but Denali, Mount Kilimanjaro and Nanga Parbat are possible candidates for the tallest mountain on land by this measure. The bases of mountain islands are below sea level, and given this consideration Mauna Kea ( above sea level) is the world's tallest mountain and volcano, rising about from the Pacific Ocean floor. Ojos del Salado has the greatest rise on Earth: vertically to the summit from the bottom of the Atacama Trench, which is about away, although most of this rise is not part of the mountain.\n\nThe highest mountains are also not generally the most voluminous. Mauna Loa () is the largest mountain on Earth in terms of base area (about ) and volume (about ), although, due to the intergrade of lava from Kilauea, Hualalai and Mauna Kea, the volume can only be estimated based on surface area and height of the edifice. Mt. Kilimanjaro is the largest non-shield volcano in terms of both base area () and volume (). Mount Logan is the largest non-volcanic mountain in base area ().\n\nThe highest mountains above sea level are also not those with peaks farthest from the centre of the Earth, because the figure of the Earth is not spherical. Sea level closer to the equator is several kilometres farther from the centre of the Earth. The summit of Chimborazo, Ecuador's tallest mountain, is usually considered to be the farthest point from the Earth's centre, although the southern summit of Peru's tallest mountain, Huascarán, is another contender. Both have elevations above sea level more than 2 km less than that of Everest.\n\nAlmost all mountains in the list are located in the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges to the south and west of the Tibetan plateau. All peaks or higher are located in East, Central or South Asia in a rectangle edged by Noshaq () on the Afghanistan–Pakistan border in the west, Jengish Chokusu (Tuōmù'ěr Fēng, ) on the Kyrgyzstan–Xinjiang border to the north, Gongga Shan (Minya Konka, ) in Sichuan to the east, and Kabru () on the Sikkim–Nepal border to the south.\n\n, the highest peak on four of the mountains — Gangkhar Puensum, Labuche Kang III, Karjiang, and Tongshanjiabu, all located in Bhutan or China — have not been ascended. The most recent peak to have its first ever ascent is Saser Kangri II East, in India, on 24 August 2011.\n\nThe highest mountain outside of Asia is Aconcagua (), which would place it at 189th highest in Asia.\n\nThe following graph ranks the countries by number of mountain peaks over 7,200 metres (23,622 ft) above sea level. Note that 38 peaks are on \"de facto\" borders and two (Jongsong Peak and Sia Kangri) are on tripoints.\n\nThe following is a stem and leaf plot of the above data. The two digits to the left of the line are the first two digits of the mountain's height (metres), and each digit to the right of the line represents the third digit of the mountain's height. Each number on the right is linked to the corresponding mountain's article. For example, the height of one of the mountains (namely Mount Everest) is .

It is located in Hannam-dong, Yongsan District. It holds lectures in English, Arabic, and Korean. Friday prayers regularly attract between four hundred and five hundred worshipers in the afternoon, though regular attendance has sometimes been known to climb as high as eight hundred people.\n\nIn the decade or so before the construction of the mosque, the Korean Muslim Federation (originally known as the Korean Muslim Society) held services in a makeshift prayer hall located in the downtown area of Seoul. Fewer than three thousand Muslims were known to be living in Korea at the time.\n\nPresident Park Chung-hee offered the Korean Muslim Federation land on which to build a proper mosque as a gesture of good will to potential Middle Eastern allies for the still young Republic of Korea. The governments of Saudi Arabia and several other Middle Eastern nations responded by providing funds to aid in the construction of the mosque. Most of the funds came from Saudi Arabia.\n\nWithin one year of the opening of Seoul Central Mosque, the number of Muslims in Korea rose from less than three thousand to over fifteen thousand. That number rose again sharply to around one hundred fifty thousand with the large influx of foreign workers from Muslim countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia in the 1990s. Today there are estimated to be at least one hundred thousand Muslims in South Korea (though some estimates suggest there being as many as two hundred thousand).\n\nSince the opening of Seoul Central Mosque, seven more mosques have been built throughout Korea. However, Seoul Central Mosque remains the only mosque in the Seoul Capital Area and thus it serves as the functional hub of the Islamic cultural community in Seoul. A busy commercial area has developed around the mosque, primarily centered around the sale and preparation of Middle Eastern cuisine and other halal food.\n\nWhile the 2007 South Korean hostage crisis in Afghanistan was underway, Seoul Central Mosque became the location of several anti-Islamic protests by Christian groups and the recipient of various bomb threats, to the point where a significant increase in police presence was deemed necessary to prevent an attack on worshipers or else on the building itself.\n\nThe mosque is also noted for its characteristically Islamic design. The large minarets on the building and the engraved Arabic calligraphy near its entrance are noteworthy in particular as being as out of place among the more standard Korean architecture that makes up the rest of Itaewon.\n\n\n"}

The rosettes are either worn on the medal to denote a higher rank, or for situations where wearing the medal is deemed inappropriate, such as on a suit. Rosettes are issued in nations such as Belgium, France, Italy and Japan. Rosettes are also sometimes called bowknots, due to their shape. Moreover, a large rosette is sometimes pinned onto the ribbon which suspends a medal, typically the Officer (and sometimes Grand Officer)'s badge of certain orders of chivalry.\n\nSome small lapel rosettes are worn in the same manner as lapel pins. For instance, knights of the Order of the British Empire now wear a lapel rosette bearing the order's cross in the center, whereas previously this was a purely metallic lapel pin. While a metal lapel pin mounted on a silk rosette is considered a decoration of distinction, this is not always true of a metal emblem lacking the ribbon backing.\n\nIn the United States, the Medal of Honor is issued with a 1/2 inch light blue rosette with white stars, authorized for civilian wear as a lapel button. Previously, the Purple Heart was also presented with a purple and white rosette, but now has been replaced by a metallic lapel pin. The lapel pin is designed to be a smaller version of the rectangular service ribbon, also for use on civilian wear. Most American military medals have the ribbon bar design scaled down to the size of a lapel pin. Members of the Sons of the American Revolution wear small, blue-and-buff rosettes as lapel buttons. The colors match those of the uniform of Gen. George Washington and the Continental Army.\n\nA rosette adorns the ribbon of all national Orders of Merit (namely the Order of Leopold, the Order of the Crown, the Order of Leopold II, and the dormant Order of the African Star and Royal Order of the Lion) at the rank of Officer. Such rosette may also be worn in diminutive form on appropriate civilian dress. Ranks above that of Officer (Commander, Grand Officer and Grand Cross) may wear a rosette adorned with gold and/or silver bars (or \"half-knots\") on each side of the rosette on appropriate civilian dress. Such rosette also adorns ribbon bars worn on the semi-formal dress uniform.\n\nSeveral of the top decorations of France, including the Légion d'honneur and the Ordre national du Mérite, are presented with a rosette along with the medal. The Legion of Honor authorized a rosette for those who are the rank of officer or above. If the grade is higher, the rosette is adorned with gold and/or silver bars (or \"half-knots\") which are place beside each side of the rosette. The same manner is accorded to the Order of National Merit. In occasions when ribbon bars are worn alone, the above-mentioned half-knots and/or rosettes are pinned onto the ribbon bars as appropriate to denote the wearer's grade.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, small silver rosettes can be added to the ribbons that are worn in place of medals. Usually these indicate multiple award bars, the number of times a decoration for merit or distinguished service has been awarded. (Exceptions are the George Cross and Victoria Cross, where the ribbons are issued only with miniatures of the medals attached.) Holders of the 1914 Star, the 1939-45 Star, the Atlantic Star, the Pacific Star, the Burma Star, the South Atlantic Medal (awarded for service in the Falklands War), the Gulf War Medal 1991 and the Sierra Leone medal could also receive these rosettes if they met certain criteria for combat service.\n\nSeveral American-based lineage societies provide a rosette as an insignia of membership for informal wear.\n\n"}

It reflects the degree to which a sample contains one enantiomer in greater amounts than the other. A racemic mixture has an ee of 0%, while a single completely pure enantiomer has an ee of 100%. A sample with 70% of one enantiomer and 30% of the other has an ee of 40% (70% − 30%).\n\nEnantiomeric excess is defined as the absolute difference between the mole fraction of each enantiomer:\n\nwhere\n\nIn practice, it is most often expressed as a percent enantiomeric excess.\nThe enantiomeric excess can be determined in another way if we know the amount of each enantiomer produced.

For mixtures of diastereomers, there are analogous definitions and uses for diastereomeric excess and percent diastereomeric excess.\n\nAs an example, a sample with 70 % of isomer and 30 % of will have a percent enantiomeric excess of 40. This can also be thought of as a mixture of 40 % pure with 60 % of a racemic mixture (which contributes half 30 % and the other half 30 % to the overall composition).\n\nIf given the enantiomeric excess formula_3 of a mixture, the fraction of the main isomer, say , can be determined using formula_4 and the lesser isomer formula_5.\n\nA non-racemic mixture of two enantiomers will have a net optical rotation. It is possible to determine the specific rotation of the mixture and, with knowledge of the specific rotation of the pure enantiomer, the optical purity can be determined.\n\nIdeally, the contribution of each component of the mixture to the total optical rotation is directly proportional to its mole fraction, and as a result the numerical value of the optical purity is identical to the enantiomeric excess. This has led to informal use the two terms as interchangeable, especially because optical purity was the traditional way of measuring enantiomeric excess. However, other methods such as chiral column chromatography and NMR spectroscopy can now be used for measuring the amount of each enantiomer individually.\n\nThe ideal equivalence between enantiomeric excess and optical purity does not always hold. For example,\n\nThe term enantiomeric excess was introduced in 1971 by Morrison and Mosher in their publication \"Asymmetric Organic Reactions\". The use of enantiomeric excess has established itself because of its historic ties with optical rotation. It has been suggested that the concept of \"ee\" should be replaced by that of \"er\" which stands for enantiomeric ratio or er (S:R) or q (S/R) because determination of optical purity has been replaced by other techniques which directly measure R and S and because it simplifies mathematical treatments such as the calculation of equilibrium constants and relative reaction rates. The same arguments are valid for changing diastereomeric excess (de) to diastereomeric ratio (dr).\n"}

Franco (born 1956) is a professor of government at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, and a leading authority on the British political philosopher Michael Oakeshott.\n\nFranco holds a B.A. from Colorado College, where he studied under Oakeshott scholar Timothy Fuller, an M.Sc. from the London School of Economics, where he studied under Oakeshott himself, and a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, where his advisor was Joseph Cropsey, a friend and disciple of the political philosopher Leo Strauss. Before Bowdoin, he taught at the University of Chicago as a William Rainey Harper Fellow.\n\nFuller called his book, \"The Political Philosophy of Michael Oakeshott\" (1990) the \"only complete and current exposition\" of Oakeshott so far. In \"The Conservative Soul, Fundamentalism, Freedom, and the Future of the Right\" (2006) blogger Andrew Sullivan referred to Franco as one of Oakeshott's \"most insightful students.\" Franco's attempt to restore Hegel's place as an enlightenment philosopher \"Hegel's Philosophy of Freedom\" (2002) addresses a growing emphasis on Hegel's romanticism and historicism. Franco's Hegel book is now generally read alongside the work of other eminent Hegel scholars such as Robert Pippin, Charles Taylor, Steven Smith, and Alexander Kojeve. Franco's current work focuses on Friedrich Nietzsche's middle works.\n\nFranco's articles and reviews have appeared in \"The American Political Science Review\", \"Political Theory\", \"The Journal of Politics\", \"The Review of Politics\", \"Political Studies\", \"Ethics\", and \"The Political Science Reviewer\".\n\n\"The Problem of Culture\": Professor Franco delivered the Karofsky Lecture at Bowdoin College on September 6, 2007. His lecture was entitled \"Friedrich Nietzsche and Liberal Education\" and in it he formulates the \"Problem of Culture:\"\n\n\"We have seen that Nietzsche’s fundamental solution to the problem was to posit the production of great human being or geniuses as the goal of education. Such a goal he thought would provide unity to an otherwise fragmentary culture, and meaning to the otherwise egoistic lives of individuals. It is in many ways a beguiling solution, but it is also deeply at odds with the fundamental presuppositions of 21st century American democracy. For this reason, it ultimately fails to carry conviction. Even Nietzsche himself changed his mind about the nature of the goal to be aimed at and his later philosophy is littered with figures, free-spirits, supermen, new philosophers, who were meant to fill the role originally attributed to the genius. Perhaps this is one of Nietzsche’s most enduring lessons—not his specific solutions he came up with, but the tireless quest to find a goal for culture and education in a world that had lost its traditional bearings, and was headed into the long twilight of nihilism. Though he may not have discovered a goal that we find compelling today, he brings home the danger, especially for education, of doing without any goal at all\" \n\n\"Freedom after the Cold War\": Franco's work on Hegel seeks to overcome the dichotomy between positive and negative liberty as articulated by western political thinkers like Isaiah Berlin during the cold war.\n\n\"Societas\" and \"universitas\": These two poles anchor Franco's thought. The former, as expressed by Oakeshott, refers to a \"band of eccentrics\" bound together by no common purposes. Universitas refers to a political order conceived as a people consecrated to a collective enterprise. Franco's work on Oakeshott leans towards the Societas understanding of politics whereas his recent works on Nietzsche lean towards a universitas conception of politics. He does not seem to think these two are mutually exclusive. One could say his project is trying to reconcile universitas and liberalism for the 21st century.\n\n"}

{"id": "1821737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821737", "title": "Love It to Death", "text": "Love It to Death\n\nLove It to Death is the third studio album by American rock group Alice Cooper, released in March 1971. It was the band's first commercially successful album and the first album that consolidated the band's aggressive hard-rocking sound. The album's best-known track, \"I'm Eighteen\", was released as a single to test the band's commercial viability before the album was recorded.\n\nFormed in the mid-1960s, the band took the name Alice Cooper in 1968 and became known for its outrageous theatrical live shows. The loose, psychedelic freak rock of the first two albums failed to find an audience. The band moved to Detroit in 1970 where they were influenced by the aggressive hard rock scene. A young Bob Ezrin was enlisted as producer; he encouraged the band to tighten its songwriting over two months of rehearsing ten to twelve hours a day. The single \"I'm Eighteen\" achieved top-forty success soon after, peaking at . This convinced Warner Bros. that Alice Cooper had the commercial potential to release an album. After its release in March 1971, \"Love It to Death\" reached on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart and has since been certified platinum. The album's second single, \"Caught in a Dream\", charted at .\n\nThe original album cover featured the singer Cooper posed with his thumb protruding so it appeared to be his penis; Warner Bros. soon replaced it with a censored version. The Love It to Death tour featured an elaborate shock rock live show: during \"Ballad of Dwight Fry\"—about an inmate in an insane asylum—Cooper would be dragged offstage and return in a straitjacket, and the show climaxed with Cooper's mock execution in a prop electric chair during \"Black Juju\". Ezrin and the Coopers continued to work together for a string of hit albums until the band's breakup in 1974. The album has come to be seen as a foundational influence on hard rock, punk, and heavy metal; several tracks have become live Alice Cooper standards and are frequently covered by other bands.\n\nDetroit-born vocalist Vincent Furnier co-formed the Earwigs in the mid-1960s in Phoenix, Arizona. The band released a few singles and went through a few name changes before settling on a lineup with guitarist Glen Buxton, guitarist and keyboardist Michael Bruce, bassist Dennis Dunaway, and drummer Neal Smith. In 1968 the band adopted the name Alice Cooper—a name Furnier later adopted as his own—and presented a story that it came from a 17th-century witch whose name they learned from a session with a ouija board.\n\nAt some point Buxton painted circles under his eyes with cigarette ashes, and soon the rest followed with ghoulish black makeup and outlandish clothes. The band moved to Los Angeles and became known for its provocative, theatrical shock rock stage show. In an incident during a performance at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival in 1969, Cooper threw a live chicken into the audience, who tore it to shreds.\n\nThe group's first two albums, \"Pretties for You\" (1969) and \"Easy Action\" (1970), appeared on Frank Zappa's Straight Records label, and failed to find an audience. The band relocated to Detroit and found itself in the midst of a music scene populated with the hard-driving rock of the MC5, the stage-diving Iggy Pop with the Stooges, and the theatricality of George Clinton's Parliament and Funkadelic. The Alice Cooper band incorporated these influences into a tight hard-rock sound coupled with an outrageous live show.\n\nWhile at the Strawberry Fields Festival in Canada in April 1970, band manager Shep Gordon contacted producer Jack Richardson, who had produced hit singles for the Guess Who. Richardson was uninterested in producing the Alice Cooper band himself, and sent the young Bob Ezrin in his place. Cooper recalled the junior producer as \"a nineteen-year-old Jewish hippie\" who reacted to meeting the outlandish band \"as if he had just opened a surprise package and found a box full of maggots\".\n\nEzrin initially turned down working with the band, but changed his mind when he saw them perform at Max's Kansas City in New York City the following October. Ezrin was impressed with the band's audience-participation rock-theater performance and the cult-like devotion of the band's fans, who dressed up and knew the lyrics and actions to the music, which Ezrin compared to the later cult following of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\". Ezrin returned to Toronto to convince Richardson to take on the band; Richardson did not want to work directly with such a group but agreed on condition that Ezrin took the lead.\n\nThe band and Ezrin did pre-production for the album in Pontiac, Michigan, in November and December 1970, and recorded at the RCA Mid-American Recording Center in Chicago in December. Richardson and Ezrin produced the album for Richardson's Nimbus 9 Productions, with Richardson as executive producer.\n\nEzrin, with his classical and folk background, attempted to have the band tighten the loosely structured songs. The band resisted at first but came to see things Ezrin's way, and ten to twelve hours a day of rehearsal resulted in a tight set of hard rock songs with little of the psychedelic freak-rock aesthetic of the first two albums. According to Cooper, Ezrin \"ironed the songs out note by note, giving them coloring, personality\". Ezrin rearranged \"I'm Eighteen\" from an eight-minute jam piece called \"I Wish I Was 18 Again\" to a taut three-minute rocker.\n\nBoth Buxton and Bruce used Gibson SG guitars and tended to double up, playing similar parts with subtle differences in phrasing and tone. Dunaway often played a moving counter-melody bass part, rather than following the typical rock strategy of holding to the chord's root.\n\nZappa had sold Straight Records to Warner Bros. in 1970 for $50,000. That November the group released a single of \"I'm Eighteen\" backed with \"Is It My Body\"; and Warner Bros. agreed to allow the group to proceed with an album if the single sold well. The band posed as fans and made hundreds of calls to radio stations to request the song, and Gordon is said to have paid others a dollar per radio request. Soon the song was on the airwaves across the US—even on mainstream AM radio—and peaked at on the charts. The success of the single convinced Warner to contract Richardson to produce \"Love It to Death\".\n\nEzrin was intent on developing a cohesive sound for the album, and his earnestness was a source of humor for the band. At a time when the Beatles had a reputation that made them seem beyond criticism, the Alice Cooper band intended \"Second Coming\" as a jab at the recently released track \"The Long and Winding Road\" with Phil Spector's elaborate production—the hyperbolic acclaim it received struck the band as if it were the Second Coming of a master composer on the order of Beethoven—as well as Ezrin's attempts to bring such production values to Alice Cooper's music. Ezrin did not realize the joke was largely at his expense. When recording the \"I wanna get out of here\" sequence of \"Ballad of Dwight Fry\", Ezrin had Cooper lie on the floor surrounded by a cage of metal chairs to create an element of realism to the singer's frantic screams. \"Black Juju\" was the only track recorded live in the studio. \"I'm Eighteen\" was a sixteen-track recording at 15 IPS; other tracks were recorded at 30 IPS.\n\nA dark, aggressive song whose lumbering, distorted guitar riff is in E minor scale, \"I'm Eighteen\" was the band's first to hit global audience. In raspy vocals against arpeggiated guitar backing, the lyrics describe the existential anguish of being at the cusp of adulthood, decrying in each verse being \"in the middle\" of something, such as \"life\" or \"doubt\". The chorus switches to a series of power chords building from A, the vocals proclaiming: \"I'm eighteen / And I don't know what I want ... I gotta get out of this place / I'll go runnin' in outer space\". The song turns around at the conclusion with an embrace of those things that had caused such anguish: \"I'm eighteen and I like it!\"\n\n\"I'm Eighteen\" comes between two straight-ahead rockers: \"Long Way to Go\" and album opener \"Caught in a Dream\". Both follow simple hard-rock , trading heavy riffing with guitar fills and solos. The album title derives from lyrics in \"Long Way to Go\". \"Caught in a Dream\" was the album's second single and features irreverent, tongue-in-cheek lyrics such as \"I need everything the world owes me / I tell that to myself and I agree\". The first side closes with \"Black Juju\" by bassist Dunaway, a lengthy track in the vein of The Doors, and Pink Floyd's \"Interstellar Overdrive\"—both bands Alice Cooper earlier had opened for—with an organ part derived from Pink Floyd's \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\". The band named the song after a stray dog in Pontiac.\n\n\"Is It My Body\", the B-side to the \"I'm Eighteen\" single, opens the second side of the album. The verses pose the questions: \"What have I got? / That makes you want to love me? / Is it my body?\"—and declare in the chorus: \"Have you got the time to find out / Who I really am?\" \"Hallowed Be My Name\" follows with lyrics such as \"Screaming at mothers / Cursing the Bible\". \"Second Coming\" continues on the theme of religion: \"... have no other gods before me / I'm the light / The devil's getting smarter all the time\" The track developed from one of Cooper's lyrical fragments—\"Time is getting closer / I read it on a poster\"—and is set to a delicate piano by Ezrin.\n\n\"The Ballad of Dwight Fry\" is a dramatic piece about the inmate of a mental asylum. It opens with a young girl's voice asking if her \"Daddy\" will \"ever come home\", against a childlike piano backdrop. The song shifts to acoustic guitar and Cooper singing presumably in the persona of the girl's father, at first in a wavering almost-whisper. His voice builds with his persona's increasing instability, eventually shouting in the heavy, guitar-backed chorus: \"See my only mind explode / Since I've gone away\". After the second chorus there is a softer, creepy keyboard break written by Bruce but played by Ezrin, and when the vocals reappear they repeat \"I wanna get out of here\", at first tentative and imploring, before climaxing in the character's total mental breakdown and a return to the chorus. The song's main character is named for Dwight Frye, an actor Hollywood media dubbed \"the man with the thousand-watt stare\" who portrayed Renfield, the lunatic slave of the titular vampire in the 1931 film \"Dracula\" starring Bela Lugosi.\n\nThe album closes with a cover of \"Sun Arise\" by Australian entertainer Rolf Harris. The upbeat pop song had been a show-opener for the band throughout 1970, and contrasts with the darkness of the rest of the album.\n\n\"I'm Eighteen\" was the band's first top 40 in the US, a success that led to a recording deal with Warner Bros. Records. It spent eight weeks on the US charts, peaking at . In Canada it broke the top ten, peaking at .\n\n\"Love It to Death\" was released on March 8, 1971; a British release of the album followed in June on the Straight label. \"Love It to Death\" was the first of the band's albums on which the members received individual credit for songs; previously the band as a whole was credited with all material. Although the original sleeve stated that the album was a Straight release, Straight had already been purchased by Warner Bros and the album bore Warner disc labels. The album reached on the US album charts, in Britain, and in Canada. The RIAA certified the album gold on November 6, 1972, and platinum on July 30, 2001. Alice Cooper was the first band on Warner Music Canada's roster to sell more than 100,000 copies each of four albums in Canada. In 1973 the band was awarded platinum albums in Canada for \"Love It to Death\", \"Killer\", \"School's Out\", and \"Billion Dollar Babies\". The album first appeared on CD in October 1990.\n\nThe original cover shows the long-haired band members in dresses and makeup, and Cooper holding a cape around himself with his thumb sticking out to give the illusion of an exposed penis. This led Warner Bros. to censor it—first that December by covering it with white strips, then by having the photo touched up with paint in pressings beginning in 1972. Both front and back cover photos were taken by Roger Prigent, credited as \"Prigent\". The gatefold features a close-up photo by Dave Griffith of Cooper's eyes heavily made-up with spidery eyelashes; in his pupils appear photos of the other band members.\n\n\"Caught in a Dream\" was released as a single backed with \"Hallowed Be My Name\" on April 27, 1971; it peaked in the US at . The group supported the album with extensive touring. \"Ballad of Dwight Fry\" was a dramatized set piece in the live show, featuring an actress dressed as a nurse who dragged Cooper offstage and brought him back on straitjacketed in time for the second verse's \"Sleepin' don't come very easy / In a strait white vest\". At the song's climax, Cooper would break free of the straitjacket and hurl it into the audience. The Love It to Death tour of 1971 featured an electric chair in the earliest staged executions of the singer. These executions were to become an attraction of the band's shows, which became progressively more flamboyant; the shows in the Billion Dollar Babies tour of 1973 concluded with Cooper's execution by prop guillotine. The Love It to Death tour grossed so much the band bought a forty-two room mansion from Ann-Margret in Greenwich, Connecticut, which was to be its home base for the next few years.\n\nIn contrast to the first two albums, which have been entirely unrepresented in Cooper’s band and solo concerts since the release of \"Killer\", \"Love It to Death\" is the fourth-most-represented album in these setlists, behind \"Welcome to My Nightmare\",\" Billion Dollar Babies \"and\" Killer\". Nevertheless, \"Love It to Death\"’s strong concert representation is almost entirely due to three songs—“I’m Eighteen”, “Is It My Body” and “The Ballad of Dwight Fry”—which have each seen over a thousand performances. “Hallowed Be My Name” has never been played live, whilst “Black Juju” and “Second Coming” have never been performed since the release of \"Killer\". Even “Caught in a Dream” and “Long Way to Go” disappeared from Cooper’s setlist after \"Killer\" was released and were revived only for individual tours after 1999.\n\nThe album garnered mixed reviews. \"Billboard\" called the album \"artfully absurd third-generation rock\" and the group \"the first stars of future rock\". John Mendelsohn gave the album a favorable review in \"Rolling Stone\", writing that it \"represents at least a modest oasis in the desert of dreary blue-jeaned aloofness served up in concert by most American rock-and-rollers\". However, referring to \"Black Juju\" he also said that \"the one bummer on this album is so loud a bummer that it may threaten to neutralize the ingratiating effect\" of the other tracks. Robert Christgau wrote in \"The Village Voice\", \"The singles ('Caught in a Dream' and 'I'm Eighteen') are fantastic, but the album is freighted with post-psychedelic garbage, the kind of thing that's done better by the heavy metal kids down the block.\"\n\nThe band saw its popularity rise over the next several albums. \"Killer\" followed in November 1971 and reached on the US charts, and the band finally topped those charts in 1973 with its sixth album, \"Billion Dollar Babies\". Unreleased demos of \"Love It to Death\" have circulated among fans; highlights include outtakes of \"Ballad of Dwight Fry\" with alternative lyrics, and early versions of \"You Drive Me Nervous\", which did not have an official release until it appeared on \"Killer\".\n\n\"Love It to Death\" is seen as one of the foundational albums of the heavy metal sound, along with contemporary releases by Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and others. A review in British magazine \"Melody Maker\" called it \"an album for the punk and pimply crowd\" a few years before punk rock became a phenomenon. Pioneer punk band the Ramones found inspiration in Alice Cooper's music and \"Love It to Death\" in particular. Vocalist Joey Ramone based the group's first song, \"I Don't Care\", on the chords of the main riff to \"I'm Eighteen\". John Lydon wrote the song \"Seventeen\" on the Sex Pistols album \"Never Mind the Bollocks\" in response to \"I'm Eighteen\", and is said to have auditioned for the Sex Pistols by miming to an Alice Cooper song—most frequently reported as \"I'm Eighteen\". \"Love It to Death\" inspired Pat Smear to pick up the guitar at age twelve; he went on to co-found the Germs, tour as second guitarist for Nirvana, and play rhythm guitar for the Foo Fighters.\n\n\"Hit Parader\" included \"Love It to Death\" in its heavy metal Hall of Fame in 1982, and placed the album twenty-first on its list of \"Top 100 Metal Albums\" in 1989. In 2012 it was ranked on \"Rolling Stone\"s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Greg Prato of AllMusic called \"Love It to Death\" \"an incredibly consistent listen from beginning to end\" and \"the release when everything began to come together for the band\". To Pete Prown and HP Newquist, the groups's theatrical arrangements help its two guitarists \" the all-too-common clichés\" in their simple hard-rock riffing and soloing \"that were part and parcel of early seventies rock\".\n\nThe band was pleased with the collaboration with Ezrin, and he remained their producer (with the exception of \"Muscle of Love\", released in 1973) until Cooper's first solo album, \"Welcome to My Nightmare\" in 1975. \"Love It to Death\" launched Ezrin's own production career, which went on to include prominent albums such as Aerosmith's \"Get Your Wings\" (1974), Kiss's \"Destroyer\" (1976), and Pink Floyd‘s \"The Wall\" (1979).\n\nSongs from \"Love It to Death\" continued to be frequent requests long after Cooper went solo. In response, when writing material for his 1989 album \"Trash\", Cooper and producer Desmond Child spent time listening to \"Love it to Death\" and the band's 1974 \"Greatest Hits\" album to \"find that vibe and match it to\" a style appropriate to the 1990s.\n\nThrash metal band Anthrax included a cover of \"I'm Eighteen\" on its debut album \"Fistful of Metal\" in 1984. Alternative metal band the Melvins covered \"Second Coming\" and \"Ballad of Dwight Fry\" on their album \"Lysol\" in 1992. The song \"Dreamin on the 1998 Kiss album \"Psycho Circus\" bears such a resemblance to \"I'm Eighteen\" that a month after the album's release Cooper's publisher filed a plagiarism suit, settled out of court in Cooper's favor. Swedish death metal band Entombed released an EP in 1999 entitled \"Black Juju\" that included a cover of \"Black Juju\".\nAlternative rock band Sonic Youth recorded covers of \"Hallowed Be My Name\" (as \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\") and \"Is It My Body\"—the latter of which is bassist Kim Gordon's favorite of her own vocal performances. Gordon used the song's title for a 1993 essay on the artist Mike Kelley, in which she described the Coopers as \"anti-hippie[s] reveling in the aesthetics of the ugly\". The essay appeared in 2014 in a collection by Gordon also titled \"Is It My Body?\"\n\nThe band members and recording personnel for \"Love It to Death\":\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located within the borough of Eastleigh. Close to the city of Southampton, Bursledon has a railway station, a marina, dockyards and the Bursledon Windmill. Nearby villages include Swanwick, Hamble-le-Rice, Netley and Sarisbury Green.\n\nThe village has close ties to the sea. The Elephant Boatyard located in Old Bursledon dates back centuries and is where Henry VIII's fleet was built. Submerged remnants of the fleet can be found in the River Hamble. The village, particularly the Jolly Sailor Pub and the Elephant Boatyard, were used as the primary filming venue for the 1980s BBC TV soap opera \"Howards' Way\".\n\nThe village was known as \"Brixendona\" or Brixenden in the 12th century, Burstlesden in the 14th century, and \"Bristelden\" in the 16th century. The name probably means \"Hill associated with a man called Beorhtsige\", from Old English personal name meaning 'bright victory' and \"dun\" meaning \"hill, modern down\". It is unlikely the Beohrtsige is the same individual who gave his name to Brixton in South London.\n\nThe original bridge carrying what is now the A27 road across the River Hamble was made of wood in 1783, and was a toll bridge. Bursledon's waterside position and woodland surroundings made it a natural location for building wooden ships. Numerous vessels were built for the Royal Navy at private shipyards at Bursledon, although a claim that two eighty-gun ships were constructed at Bursledon during the reign of William IV is untrue. The yard owned by Philemon Ewer in the 18th century was responsible for the building of the 50-gun and the sloop in 1744, the 50-gun in 1745, the 24-gun in 1746, and the 60-gun HMS \"Anson\" in 1747 among other vessels. There is a monument to Ewer, who died in 1750, featuring a model of the \"Anson\" in the parish church. George Parsons's Bursledon shipyard built a number of naval ships from 1778 to 1807, when he moved to Warsash at the mouth of the River Hamble; this included HMS \"Elephant\" launched in 1786, which carried Nelson to the Battle of Copenhagen. Although most of the construction of these ships was carried out in Bursledon, they were sailed after their launchings to Portsmouth to be sheathed in copper there.\n\nBy the 1870s, the shipbuilding trade had disappeared from Bursledon and the main industry was arable agriculture, particularly the growing of strawberries.\n\nThe Bursledon Brickworks, based in the village of Swanwick (now in the Borough of Fareham), was founded in 1897 and produced the famous Fareham red brick. Today it is the last surviving example of a Victorian steam powered brickworks in the country. The brickworks were sold to Hampshire Buildings Preservation Trust , and can be visited as the Bursledon Brickworks Industrial Museum.\n\nNotable people from Bursledon include:\n\nAccording to local legend, the old Victorian bridge over the railway line on Coal Park Lane is haunted by the ghost of Polly Crook whose love of distilled apple cider and clay pipe caused her to accidentally ignite herself on this spot.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1821753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821753", "title": "Golden billion", "text": "Golden billion\n\nThe golden billion () is a term, in the Russian-speaking world, referring to the relatively wealthy people in industrially developed nations, or the West.\n\nAccording to Sergey Kara-Murza, the golden billion consumes the lion's share of all resources on the planet. If at least half of the global population begins to consume resources to the same extent, these resources wouldn't be sufficient. This is partly based on the ideas of Thomas Malthus, in that emphasis is placed on the scarcity of natural resources. However, whereas Malthus was mostly concerned with finite global crop yields, anti-globalists that advocate the idea of a \"golden billion\" are mostly concerned with finite natural resources such as fossil fuels and metal. According to Kara-Murza, the developed countries, while preserving for their nationals a high level of consumption, endorse political, military and economic measures designed to keep the rest of the world in an industrially undeveloped state and as a raw-material appendage area for the dumping of hazardous waste and as a source of cheap labor.\nThe theory, which holds that the wealth of the West, including that of the lower classes, is mostly based on exploitation of the former colonies in the third world, is not new in Russia, where it was first popularized by Vladimir Lenin, in Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. Lenin described the relationship between capitalism and imperialism, wherein the merging of banks and industrial cartels produces finance capital. The final, imperialist stage of capitalism, originates in the financial function of generating greater profits than the home market can yield; thus, business exports (excess) capital, which, in due course, leads to the economic division of the world among international business monopolies, and imperial European states colonising large portions of the world to generate investment profits.\n\nWhereas Lenin and other Marxist anti-imperialists such as Immanuel Wallerstein called for an end to the domination of developed nations through international communism, Kara-Murza and his contemporaries in Russia believe that a restriction of free trade (especially with the West), and various methods of state intervention in the economy is the best solution. This economic rationale for protectionism dates back to the early United States and is known as the infant industry argument. The crux of the argument is that nascent industries often do not have the economies of scale that their older competitors from other countries may have, and thus need to be protected until they can attain similar economies of scale. The argument was first explicated by Alexander Hamilton in his 1790 Report on Manufactures, was systematically developed by Daniel Raymond, and was later picked up by Friedrich List in his 1841 work \"The National System of Political Economy\", following his exposure to the idea during his residence in the United States in the 1820s.\n\nThe differences in incomes in first-world countries and third-world countries cannot be explained by differences in individual productivity. For example, the Caterpillar (CAT) factory in Tosno, Russia has the highest productivity of all CAT factories in Europe, but the workers are paid about an order of magnitude less. The difference is even more startling when comparing the wages of textile workers in United States factories and in China sweatshops. This means that the multinational corporations appropriate a disproportionally high share of the surplus value in \"developing\" countries. The argument usually holds that the continuation of this exploitation retards the development and prosperity of the developing nations. Hence, globalization and modern capitalism benefit mostly the golden billion, while people in the so-called \"developing\" countries are getting the short end of the stick.\n\nThe term was coined by A. Kuzmich (Anatoly Tsikunov) in his book \"The Plot of World Government: Russia and the Golden Billion\" and used in his articles. The main idea behind this term was taken from Limits to Growth – that there are enough resources for only one billion wealthy people on Earth. The term was later popularized by Russian writer Sergey Kara-Murza.\n\nCensurers were studying the use of the concept \"golden billion\" for the analysis of a state of the world and prospects of the development. They specified that the problem of possible imbalance of growth of the population with limited resource of Earth was considered in the past repeatedly. The early Christian theologian Tertullian, who lived in 1st–2nd centuries AD gave the alarm about it: \"The strongest witness is the vast population of the earth to which we are a burden and she scarcely can provide for our needs; as our demands grow greater, our complaints against Nature's inadequacy are heard by all. The scourges of pestilence, famine, wars and earthquakes have come to be regarded as a blessing to overcrowded nations, since they serve to prune away the luxuriant growth of the human race.\"\n\nOpponents of the concept often invoke market efficiency to argue that free trade and capitalism will make everybody wealthy eventually. Proponents counter that the ongoing process of multinational corporations channeling wealth from poorer countries to richer ones dictates that the gap will not diminish.\n\nAvailable data indicates convergence of income for many developing countries.\n\nIn his book The Ultimate Resource, Julian Simon offers the view that scarcity of physical resources can be overcome by the human mind. For example, the argument of scarcity of oil could be overcome by some of energy development strategies, such as use of synthetic fuels.\n\nModern estimations indicate that mineral shortages will not become a threat for many centuries \n\nConcerning exploitation of the former colonies, Gregory Clark notes: \"Yet generations of research by economic historians – David Landes, Deirdre McCloskey, and Joel Mokyr, among others – show that the wealth of the West was homegrown, the result of a stream of Western technological advances since the Industrial Revolution.\"\n\nAn online search for the terms \"gold billion\" or \"golden billion\" suggest that the term is little known in the English-speaking world. One article about the role of libraries in helping people realize community potential references the concept:\n\n"}

Bidwill (September 16, 1895 – April 19, 1947), sometimes known as Charley Bidwill, was an owner of the National Football League's Chicago Cardinals. He owned the team for 14 seasons, from 1933 through 1946. His interest in sports was demonstrated by his two aims in life: to win an NFL Championship and the Kentucky Derby. He would accomplish neither during his lifetime, although his Cardinals won the 1947 NFL title only eight months after his death. The title still remains the most recent in franchise history.\n\nCharles was the son of Chicago 9th Ward Alderman Joseph Edward Bidwill and Mary Anne Sullivan. His eldest brother Joseph Edward Bidwill Jr. was a clerk of the Chicago Circuit Court; his younger brother Arthur John Bidwill was a Republican State Senator; and Loretta was Charlie's only sister.\n\nPrior to his ownership of the Cardinals, Bidwill was a successful businessman and wealthy lawyer in Chicago, with ties to organized crime boss Al Capone. He was owner of a racing stable, the president of the Chicago Stadium Operating Company and owner of a printing company. Bidwill's only physical participation in athletics came only during his time at St. Ignatius High School and Loyola University. After graduation in 1916, he began his law practice, serving as assistant prosecutor for Chicago and corporation counsel. As a businessman, Bidwill was often referred to as \"Blue Shirt Charlie\" because he sometimes favored a blue shirt and high boots instead of the traditional white shirt and businessman's shoes.'.\n\nBidwill was part owner of the Chicago Bears, after he helped George Halas buy Edward “Dutch” Sternaman share of the team in 1933. According to Halas, Bidwill purchased team stocks for $5,000:\n\nOne night in 1932, Dr. David Jones, the then-owner of the Cardinals, and his wife were guests at an informal dinner party aboard Bidwill's luxurious power-cruising yacht, \"The Ren-Mar\". Bidwill, then a vice president of the Chicago Bears, spoke with Jones that night and the conversation turned to pro football, with Jones complaining of the poor state of his team. Half jokingly, Charles' wife, Violet, asked Jones, \"Why don't you sell the Cardinals to Charley?\" Jones replied that he would sell anything he owned if the price was right. Bidwill soon turned to Jones and the two began to discuss an offer. Bidwill went on to buy the Cardinals from Jones for $50,000. Bidwill handed Jones a down payment of $2,000 and the two men shook hands. The sale was not announced until 1933 to allow Bidwill time to dispose of his stock in the Bears. It was well known that Bidwill would have much preferred to buy the Bears, but George Halas refused to sell.\n\nIn spite of Bidwill's enthusiasm for the game, the Cardinals were not a successful club during the 1930s and early 1940s. Despite Bidwill's wealth and enthusiasm, the Cardinals found the going difficult both on and off the field for most of his tenure as owner. In addition to the Great Depression, they had the misfortune of sharing Chicago with the popular Bears. Bidwill had become so discouraged that by 1940 he made a try at buying the Detroit Lions. When that effort fell through, he redoubled his efforts to rebuild the Cardinals. One move was to hire Jimmy Conzelman as coach. However, the Cards continued to lose, and Conzelman quit as coach to go into the front office of baseball's St. Louis Browns.\n\nBidwill remained a Bears fan for years, even after he purchased the Cardinals. He would often root for the Bears against the Cardinals when his old team was a contender and the Cards were perpetually stuck in last place. For example, in 1941 the Bears needed a victory over the Cardinals to force a playoff game, but trailed the 3–6–1 Cardinals by a score of 24–20 before pulling out two last-minute touchdowns to win, 34–24. After the game, instead of complimenting coach Jimmy Conzelman on the fine showing, the nervous Bidwill sighed, \"Whew, that was a close one, wasn't it?\"\n\nCardinals founder Chris O'Brien did not attempt to publicly take credit for the Cardinals winning the 1925 NFL Championship. The 1925 NFL Championship was surrounded in a controversy, since the Pottsville Maroons won the championship that year only to have their title stripped after playing an illegal game in Philadelphia after they had finished the season with the NFL's best record. However Bidwill claimed the 1925 title after he took over the team in 1933. There are some who believe that a \"curse\" was placed on the Cardinals as a result of the debacle, and that in an era where the NFL has implemented measures to ensure competitive parity, the curse is the reason for the failure of the Cardinals to win as many championships as would be expected with a team of such longevity (the Cardinals' only other championship came in 1947).\n\nThe lowest point of Bidwill's tenure came in 1944. Due to World War II, many players were serving in the United States military. This left a league-wide shortage of players. As a result, the Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Steelers merged their teams for the season. The team's name Card-Pitt was quickly dubbed the \"Carpets\" by detractors, as \"every team in the league walks over them\". The team lost ten straight to post an 0–10 record.\n\nThe end of the war brought another problem when the upstart AAFC placed a team in Chicago, the Rockets. The new AAFC franchise publicly pushed for the Cardinals to leave town, believing that Chicago wasn't big enough for three top-level pro football teams. Bidwill grew angry and vowed to turn his team into a profitable winner. He stunned the football world in 1947 when he outbid the Rockets for the rights to All-American Charley Trippi, signing him to a then record $100,000 contract. Trippi was the final piece of what Bidwill called his \"Dream Backfield\" of Paul Christman, Pat Harder, Marshall Goldberg, Elmer Angsman, and Trippi. They led the Cardinals to their first (and, to date, only) undisputed NFL championship in 1947. He was 51 when he died\n\nBidwill was not around to see his \"Dream Backfield\" win the 1947 title; he died of pneumonia in April, shortly after signing Trippi. His widow Violet inherited the team and ran it until her death in early 1962. During Violet's tenure as the Cardinals owner, she and her husband Walter Wolfner relocated the franchise to St. Louis in 1960. Following her death, she left the team to her adopted sons from her first marriage, Charles Jr. and Bill. He is a member of the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967.\n\nBill bought his older brother's share in 1972, and remained sole owner until his death in 2019. The team is currently held in an estate, though Bill's son Michael, who has been team president and operating head of the franchise since 2007, is expected to take over legal ownership. Since Bill took over, the team has since relocated once more, to their current location in Phoenix, Arizona in 1988, and since 1994, have been known as the Arizona Cardinals. Only the Bears (owned by Halas and his descendants since 1921) and the New York Giants (owned by the Mara family since their founding in 1925) have been in the hands of one family longer than the Cardinals.\n\n"}

Ocna Mureș has a chlorosodic products plant,a salt extraction plant and a spa which uses the salty water from the former mines.\n\nThe town administers five villages: Cisteiu de Mureș (\"Magyarcsesztve\"), Micoșlaca (\"Miklóslaka\"), Războieni-Cetate (\"Székelyföldvár\"), Uioara de Jos (until 1965 \"Ciunga\"; \"Csongva\") and Uioara de Sus (\"Felsőmarosújvár\").\n\nThe spa is no longer running. The chemical plant in town was lastly purchased by an Indian company from a company based in Timișoara. Currently the plant has ceased activity. The majority of high school students attend either Liceul Teoretic Petru Maior or the 'Chemistry School,' where many are trained to later work for the factory in town.

{"id": "1821758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821758", "title": "For Your Pleasure", "text": "For Your Pleasure\n\nFor Your Pleasure is the second album by the English rock band Roxy Music, released by Island Records in 1973. It was their last to feature synthesiser and sound specialist Brian Eno, who would later gain acclaim as a solo artist and producer.\n\nThe group was able to spend more studio time on this album than on their debut, combining strong song material by Bryan Ferry with more elaborate production treatments. For example, the song \"In Every Dream Home a Heartache\" (Ferry's sinister ode to a blow-up doll) fades out in its closing section, only to fade in again with all the instruments subjected to a pronounced phasing treatment. The title track fades out in an elaborate blend of tape loop effects. Brian Eno remarked that the eerie \"The Bogus Man\", with lyrics about a sexual stalker, displayed similarities with contemporary material by the krautrock group Can.\n\nOf the more upbeat numbers on the album, \"Do the Strand\" and \"Editions of You\" were both based around insistent rhythms in the tradition of the band's first single \"Virginia Plain\". \"Do the Strand\" has been called the archetypal Roxy Music anthem, whilst \"Editions of You\" was notable for a series of ear-catching solos by Andy Mackay (saxophone), Eno (VCS3), and Phil Manzanera (guitar).\n\nEno is very present in the final song from the album, \"For Your Pleasure\" making it unlike any other song on the album. The song ends with the voice of Judi Dench saying \"\"You don't ask. You don't ask why\"\" amid tapes of the opening vocals ('Well, how are you?') from \"Chance Meeting\" from the first Roxy Music album. A live recording of the song has been used in 1975 as a B-side to \"Both Ends Burning\".\n\nThe original UK LP cover credits \"Produced by Chris Thomas and Roxy Music\" for the entire album, but only the side one label repeats that; the side two label credits \"Produced by John Anthony and Roxy Music.\" Various foreign editions and reissues have confused the matter with random variations. \n\nAs with the debut Roxy Music album, no UK singles were lifted from \"For Your Pleasure\" upon its initial release. A non-album single \"Pyjamarama\" b/w \"The Pride and the Pain\", was issued in advance of the album in Britain, making #10. \"Do the Strand\" b/w \"Editions of You\" was released as a single in the US and Europe; it was finally issued as a UK single in 1978 to promote Roxy's \"Greatest Hits\" album, released in December the previous year.\n\nThe cover photo, taken by Karl Stoecker, featured Bryan Ferry's girlfriend at the time, singer and model Amanda Lear, who later became Salvador Dalí's muse. Original pressings of the album (by Island Records in the UK, and Warner Bros. Records in the US), featured a gatefold sleeve picturing all five band members posing with guitars.\n\n\"For Your Pleasure\" made No. 4 in UK charts in 1973. In 2000 \"Q\" magazine placed it at number 33 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 1973, Paul Gambaccini of \"Rolling Stone\" gave it a mixed review, and wrote that \"the bulk of \"For Your Pleasure\" is either above us, beneath us, or on another plane altogether.\" However, by 2012, the album was ranked number 396 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It was one of four by the group that made the list (\"Country Life\", \"Siren\" and \"Avalon\" being the others). It placed at 87 on \"Pitchfork\"'s Top 100 Albums of the 1970s. The citation notes that Morrissey told the British press that \"he could 'only think of one truly great British album: \"For Your Pleasure\".\" \"Classic Rock\" named the album in their list of \"10 Essential Glam Rock Albums\". \"NME\" ranked the album at 88 on their list of 500 greatest albums of all time, and called it \"the pinnacle of English art rock.\" \"Happy Mag\" named the album in their list of \"10 records to introduce you to the world of art-rock\" and called it \"an art-pop, glam-rock masterpiece.\"\n\nRoxy Music\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nProduction\n\n"}

It is situated to the south-east of the city of Southampton, and flanked on one side by the ruins of Netley Abbey and on the other by the Royal Victoria Country Park.\n\nAs late as 1800, Netley consisted of little other than the ruins of the Abbey, and two villas known as Netley Castle and Netley Lodge. Development of the village expanded after the founding of the old Royal Victoria Military Hospital (or Netley Hospital) in 1856, in connection with the Crimean War. The hospital was used extensively from 1863 through World War II until its closure in 1979 when it was converted into a country park.\n\nEarlier, the abbey ruins made Netley a popular excursion from Southampton - both Cassandra Austen and her sister Jane planning excursions there, for example, when staying in the town in 1808.\n\nThe oldest part of Netley retains the feel of a somewhat old-fashioned and quaint village, with some traditional small shops, and rows of colourful terraced cottages. It is located along the eastern shore of Southampton Water; the shingle beach looks across to Hythe and Fawley, although the vista is somewhat dominated by Fawley Oil Refinery.\n\nAway from the shore, larger estates of houses have developed over the years which have greatly increased Netley's population and blurred the boundary between Netley Abbey and Butlocks Heath. There were two schools linked to each other, called Netley Abbey Infant School and Netley Abbey & Butlocks Heath County Junior School; there was extensive building on the site of the junior school in the late 1980s, and the site now provides a primary school for the village. There are a handful of churches, including the parish church of St Edward the Confessor.\n\nNetley Railway Station has hourly services to Southampton Central and Portsmouth Harbour via the train company South Western Railway, providing links for commuters both in and out of the village.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1821769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821769", "title": "Kelso (horse)", "text": "Kelso (horse)\n\nKelso (April 4, 1957 – October 16, 1983) was an American thoroughbred race horse considered among the best racehorses in history. In the list of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century by The Blood-Horse magazine, Kelso ranks 4th, behind only Man o' War (1st), Secretariat (2nd) and Citation (3rd). In his long career, Kelso defeated many leading Thoroughbred racehorses including Carry Back, Gun Bow, Bald Eagle, Tompion, Never Bend, Beau Purple, Quadrangle, Roman Brother, Crimson Satan, Jaipur, Ridan and Pia Star, as well as other top thoroughbreds, often conceding weight under handicap conditions. In doing so, Kelso beat more champions and Hall of Fame horses than any other thoroughbred racehorse in the 20th Century.\n\nKelso's pedigree was undistinguished. Born at Claiborne Farm near Paris, Kentucky, he was sired by a well-known racehorse who was an unproven stallion, Your Host. Kelso's dam was the unheralded Maid of Flight (although her sire was Count Fleet and her grandsire was Man o' War). Kelso was her first foal; he was scrawny, runty and hard to handle. He was a maternal grandson of U.S. Triple Crown champion Count Fleet, who is ranked #5 by \"The Blood-Horse\". Before he set foot on a track, owner Allaire du Pont had him gelded in the hopes of calming him down. According to many, it did not work; Kelso was never a well-mannered horse. He was named for Mrs. du Pont's friend Kelso Everett and, like Mr. Everett, who went by the nickname of \"Kelly\", so did the horse.\n\nThe Right Rev. Arthur Raymond McKinstry was known as Kelso's chaplain. Talking to reporters, McKinstry said, \"On the occasion of President Johnson and Mrs. Johnson's 30th wedding anniversary, the White House reporters asked me if I had any other claim to fame. I thought a little while and then had to confess to them that, among my friends in Wilmington, I am casually spoken of as the private chaplain for the great racehorse, Kelso. Taken aback, one reporter turned and asked me, 'Do you mean to say that you direct heavenly words to God on behalf of a racehorse?' 'I don't have to,' I replied. 'Let's say I just sit there with my fingers crossed and hope a little.'\"\n\nTrained by Dr. John Lee and racing for Ms. du Pont's \"nom de course\" Bohemia Stable, Kelso, ridden by John Block, made his two-year-old debut on September 4, 1959, at Atlantic City Race Course (at that time one of the country's premier tracks). The race was an ordinary maiden event (which he won). He was lightly regarded in his second start ten days later, when he finished second. The gelding was the favorite in his third race, which was shortly after his second and in which he again placed second. He did not race again as a two-year-old.\n\nKelso's three-year-old season began after the Triple Crown races of 1960 were run. Dr. John Lee had returned to his veterinary practice, and Kelso's new trainer was Carl Hanford (inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2006), who handled him for the remainder of his career. Bill Hartack was his jockey for a short time, followed by Eddie Arcaro, who rode Kelso from mid-1960 to November 1961, when he retired as a jockey. In 1962, Ismael Valenzuela became Kelso's principal rider for more than three years.\n\nKelso's first start as a three-year-old (and first win for Hanford) was at Monmouth Park. Hanford said, \"He was an extremely determined horse. If he saw a horse in front, he wanted to get to him. You could take him back or send him to the front. He was an extremely sound horse who was light on his feet with incredible balance. Kelso could wheel on a dime, spinning round in a circle and never letting his feet touch each other.\" After the Monmouth race, he won eight of his next nine starts: a mile race at Aqueduct Racetrack in a record for a three-year-old at that distance, the Choice Stakes, the Jerome Handicap, the Discovery Handicap, the Lawrence Realization Stakes, the Hawthorne Gold Cup Handicap and the 2 mile Jockey Club Gold Cup (the latter two against older horses). In the Lawrence Realization, he equaled Man O 'War's time of 2:40-4/5 for 1⅝ miles. In 1960, Kelso was voted Three-Year-Old Champion Male and received the American Horse of the Year award ahead of Bald Eagle.\n\nAt age four in 1961, Kelso won seven of nine starts. That year, he was voted Champion Older Horse and again Horse of the Year. In 1962, he won a third Horse of the Year title, taking 28 of the 32 votes in the \"Daily Racing Form\" poll. A year later, he was even more dominant, being a unanimous choice for his fourth DRF title, as well as taking the Horse of the Year awards of the Thoroughbred Racing Association and Turf and Sport Digest magazine. Kelso again swept the Horse of the Year awards by all three organisations in 1964.\n\n\nUnlike many top racehorses, Kelso took a while to warm up his career. He competed for eight seasons, from 1959 to 1966. As his career reached its zenith, so did his popularity, and huge crowds flocked to see him. Kelso competed on fourteen tracks, won in six states, set nine track records (plus two American records), was the all-time leading money-winner at his retirement and was beloved by racing fans for his courage and consistency.\n\nIn March 1966, Kelso suffered a hairline fracture of the inside sesamoid of his right hind foot. Hanford immediately retired him at age nine. Kelso left the track as racing's all-time leading money winner with lifetime earnings of $1,977,896. This earnings record held for 14 years, until it was surpassed by Affirmed in 1979. Of Kelso's 63 starts, he won 39, placed 12 times and finished third twice. He was out of the money 10 times. His record probably would have been even better if not for the huge weight allowances he spotted his rivals under handicap conditions for much of his career.\n\nAccepting his Hall of Fame award in August 2006, Carl Hanford said, \"I am here today because of one horse and one horse only. Although I've had a few stakes horses before, they didn't compare with Kelso. There is an old saying on the racetrack that 'a good horse is dangerous in anybody's hands.' How true that is. Of all the top trainers in the past that have had this honor, I may be a little bit prejudiced, but I don't think any one of them had their hands on a horse like Kelso.\"\n\nOne of the greatest turf writers in history, Joe Hirsch, wrote, \"Once upon a time there was a horse named Kelso. But only once.\"\n\nAs a gelding, Kelso could not be retired to stud. Instead, he went on to a second career as a hunter and show jumper. In 1967, he was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.\n\nOn October 15, 1983, the 26-year-old Kelso paraded prior to the start of the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park along with champion horse Forego and the still active John Henry in front of a crowd of over 32,000 spectators. It was Kelso's final public appearance - he died the next day on October 16, 1983. He is buried in the equine cemetery at Allaire du Pont's Woodstock Farm in Chesapeake City, Maryland.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on Valentine's Day, 1999. The episode takes place on Valentine's Day, and the wives of Springfield are jealous of the attention Apu gives to his wife Manjula. Angered by this, Moe and the Springfield husbands spy on Apu to sabotage his romantic plans.\n\n\"I'm with Cupid\" was written by Dan Greaney and directed by Bob Anderson. Because the episode was to air on Valentine's Day, Fox wanted the episode to relate to the holiday, although the idea for the episode was pitched by Greaney. The title of the episode is based on the popular T-shirt slogan \"I'm with stupid\". Elton John guest-starred as himself, and recorded a new version of his song \"Your Song\" for the episode. The episode also features references to \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", Tiffany & Co. and \"Lisa the Vegetarian\", an earlier episode in the series.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"I'm With Cupid\" was seen by approximately 7.7 million viewers and finished in 48th place in the ratings the week it aired. \n\nFollowing the home media release of \"The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season\", the episode received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\nApu and his new wife Manjula invite Homer and Marge to their house for dinner. However, Apu and Manjula get in a fight, after Marge mentions to Manjula that Apu does not need to work as much as he does. The week before Valentine's Day, Apu tells Homer that he is disappointed that Manjula does not love him, until Homer assures him that Manjula will not leave him before Valentine's Day, and Apu agrees. Apu decides to shower Manjula with many romantic surprises to regain her love. However, although many of Apu's surprises succeed in fixing his marriage, they ruin other people's relationships. The rest of Springfield's women become jealous from all the attention Manjula is receiving, and find their men to be cheapskates (including Maude Flanders). At Moe's Tavern, Homer encourages several of Springfield's men that they have to prevent Apu and Manjula from reconciling to save their own relationships and marriages.\n\nDuring Valentine's Day, Homer, Chief Wiggum, Dr. Hibbert, Moe, and Ned Flanders investigate what Apu is doing so they can stop it. They go around town and Flanders is thrown out of the group for suggesting they should be using their time to be more romantic to their wives instead of trying to sabotage Apu. Following Apu to the airport, the remaining group see Elton John there, and they think that he came to Springfield to perform a concert for Apu and Manjula at his insistence (in reality, he had to make an emergency landing because the chandelier on his plane was malfunctioning). However, Apu's actual plan is that he arranged for a skywriter to write \"I ♥ U MANJULA\". During the trouble that ensues, Homer jumps on the plane during takeoff to try to stop the skywriter from spraying the message. When Homer destroys the plane's canister in mid-air it only sprayed part of the message - \"I ♥ U ★\", which the other women think is for them. While Homer and the pilot fight, Marge remains unconvinced until the plane flies by and Homer drops out of it covered with roses after the plane flew out of control through a thorny rose patch, possibly giving Homer a collapsed lung, nonetheless, Elton John is able to perform a private concert for Apu and Manjula, and their marriage is saved. The end credits are red instead of their usual orange.\n\n\"I'm With Cupid\" was written by Dan Greaney and directed by Bob Anderson. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on Valentine's Day, 1999. Because they knew it would air on Valentine's Day, Fox asked the \"Simpsons\" staff to produce an episode related to the holiday. The episode's ending credits were also painted red in honor of the holiday. The idea for the episode was pitched by Greaney, who also wrote the episode's first draft. The episode's title was pitched by fellow \"Simpsons\" writer Ron Hauge, who based it on the popular T-shirt slogan I'm with stupid. However, Hauge later found out that the title had already been used before for an episode of another television series. However, he did not believe that copyright issues would arise: \"It's a very innocent mistake,\" Hauge said in the DVD commentary for the episode. \"It is one of those things that, in the course of a career, you're gonna be on both sides of that, so nobody ever sues on it.\"\n\nJan Hooks reprised her role as Manjula in the episode. In a scene in the episode, Apu and Manjula are arguing in Hindi. During the scene, both characters speak the language accurately, as both Hooks and Hank Azaria (the voice of Apu) were given a phonetic transcription of their lines. The singing parrot that Apu sends to Manjula was voiced by series main cast member Nancy Cartwright, who also portrays Bart in the series. The episode features singer Sir Elton John as himself. John's lines were recorded by current showrunner Al Jean, who found working with John being a \"wonderful experience\". \"Elton John was a very nice person,\" Scully spoke for Jean in the DVD commentary for the episode, since Jean was busy during the commentary record. \"He was a great sport and worked really hard for the show.\" Scully also stated that the re-recording of \"Your Song\", which appears near the end of the episode, had to be recorded \"several times,\" but that John was \"very accommodating\" about it.\n\nIn their book \"Picturing South Asian Culture in English: Textual and Visual Representations\", Tasleem Shakur and Karen D'Souza analyzed \"I'm with Cupid\" along with the season 9 episode \"The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons\". The two argued that \"I'm with Cupid\" represents Apu's role in the series, and \"reinforces the romanticised view of Apu's marriage through the increasingly elaborate ways in which he expresses his love for his wife.\" They wrote: \"In a Valentine's day episode, the message is clearly critically showing up the all-American men of Springfield for their lack of romance. [...] Throughout this episode, Apu's identity is reinforced as exotic other, but not so much as 'South Asian' other, as an 'American' ideal other, that more wholesome, romantic male juxtaposed to the Duff drinking, couch potato male typified by the men of Moe's bar and Homer Simpson. Again, Apu is not so much represented in his ethnicity, but presented in his critical otherness to both contemporary degenerativeness of American culture, specifically male identities and ironically (re)constructed idea of South Asianness. In these two episodes, the Asian cultural space which Apu, his mother and Manjula perform is a hybrid one, mixing 'Asian' and 'American' values and identities, but critically displacing Asian 'authenticity' and revealing the displacement of contemporary American marriage from its 'authentic' traditions.\"\n\nIn a scene late in the episode, John, having just chewed his way out of a dog carrier, meets Apu, who exclaims \"Elton John!\", to which John replies \"That's my name! Well, not really.\" The exchange references John's name change, as his birth name was Reginald Dwight. Apu quotes the names of four of John's songs, \"Take Me to the Pilot\", \"Your Song\", \"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\" and \"The Bitch is Back\". At the end of the episode, John performs a version of \"Your Song\" for Apu and Manjula on the roof of the Kwik-E-Mart. The scene is a callback to the season 7 episode \"Lisa the Vegetarian\", in which Paul McCartney performed on the roof. The scene in which Homer is seen jamming Valentine's Day cards into their holders were based on an observation by the writers. Writer George Meyer said of the scene: \"You just see cards get really man-handled, and the envelopes get switched with the wrong sizes.\" In another scene, Marge and Manjula are seen playing badminton. While the scene was conceived in order to provide exposition, the sport was included because badminton is \"very popular\" in India, according to writer Ian Maxtone-Graham. The episode also mentions the 1961 film \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\". In a scene, Apu, carrying a shopping bag, exits the jewellery and silverware store Tiffany & Co. Meanwhile, Homer, along with Wiggum, Moe, Flanders and Dr. Hibbert are watching Apu, assuming he bought jewellery for Manjula. It is soon revealed that Apu bought a croissant in the store, to which Wiggum says \"Oh, that's right, they have breakfast at Tiffany's now.\" The heart-shaped fade out at the end of the episode is a reference to the series \"Love, American Style\".\n\nIn its original American broadcast on February 14, 1999, \"I'm with Cupid\" received a 7.7 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 7.7 million viewers. The episode finished in 48th place in the ratings for the week of February 8–14, 1999. On August 7, 2007, the episode was released as part of \"The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD box set. Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Ron Hauge and Matt Selman participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode.\n\nFollowing its home video release, \"I'm with Cupid\" received generally positive reviews from critics. \n\nIn 2007, Simon Crerar of \"The Times\" listed Elton John's performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show. \n\nJames Plath of DVD Town wrote that the episode is \"funny\" because \"it has a plot we recognize from our own lives,\" and Jake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News considered it to be one of the season's best episodes. \n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\" gave the episode a positive review as well, calling it \"Very, very clever and funny,\" and wrote \"it's executed stylishly and Homer wins in the end; entirely by default of course, but maybe that's his reward for not falling off the skywriting plane until the last minute!\" However, they also criticized the episode for being \"a little tacky,\" writing \"After all, how nice are these people who want to ruin Apu and Manjula's day just because they're scared of looking bad?\"\n\nWriting for IGN, Robert Canning described \"I'm with Cupid\" as \"very smart and very funny\" and \"a great episode representing one piece of Apu's journey.\" However, he disliked John's guest appearance in the episode, describing it as \"completely unnecessary\" and \"very tacked on,\" and described John's performance as \"very flat.\" Nevertheless, Canning gave the episode an 8.8 rating and concluded his review by describing it as a \"tightly written Valentine's episode.\" \n\nGiving the episode a more mixed review, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide criticized it for being too similar to an earlier episode, writing \"Didn’t we already see that Flanders makes everyone else look like a jerk on Valentine’s Day? Doesn’t that theme mean that 'Cupid' is somewhat redundant?\" He added \"Yes that the show lacks any spark, as it throws out a reasonable number of laughs,\" and concluded his review by writing that \"it seems a little stale and not one of the year’s better programs.\"\n\n\n"}

The album consists of with big band arrangements. It comprises a first half of big band songs and a second half of string-backed ballads. \"The Genius of Ray Charles\" sold fewer than 500,000 copies and charted at number 17 on the \"Billboard\" 200. \"Let the Good Times Roll\" and \"Don't Let the Sun Catch You Cryin'\" were released as singles in 1959.\n\nThe album showcased Charles' breakout from rhythm and blues and onto a broader musical stage. Atlantic Records gave him full support in production and arrangements. As originally presented, the A side of the album featured the Ray Charles band with David \"Fathead\" Newman supplemented by players from the Count Basie and Duke Ellington bands, and arrangements by Quincy Jones.\n\nThe B side of the original album consists of six ballads with arrangements by Ralph Burns and a large string orchestra. Charles's performance of \"Come Rain or Come Shine\", a song identified with Frank Sinatra, brought public attention to his voice alone without the \"distractions\" of his soulful piano and his snappy band. \n\nEach side contains a tribute to Louis Jordan with two songs he had hits with \"Let the Good Times Roll\" and \"Don't Let the Sun Catch You Cryin'\".\n\nIn a contemporary review, Joe Goldberg of the \"American Record Guide\" panned the arrangements as \"hopelessly banal and inadequate, saved only\" by the piano playing of Charles, who \"comes through beautifully\", and felt that only the last three songs give the album \"its importance\". He called \"Am I Blue?\" the album's highlight and \"almost unbearably poignant, with the same feeling of deep sensibility transcending limited vocal equipment that can be heard on Walter Huston's recording of 'September Song', or Adolph Green's of 'A Quiet Girl'.\"\n\nIn a retrospective review for Allmusic, music critic Scott Yanow wrote that \"Charles' voice is heard throughout in peak form, giving soul to even the veteran standards.\" In a 1990 review of its CD reissue, Lloyd Sachs of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote that \"The Genius of Ray Charles\" is \"one of the all-time great albums. But it is not, alas, one of all the all-time great CDs. The sound is extremely harsh, exaggerating the partially hidden flaws of the original ... Still, the glory of Charles' singing and the ace arrangements ... have a way of breaking down resistance.\" In 2000, \"Q\" magazine included \"The Genius of Ray Charles\" in their list of the \"Best Soul Albums of All Time\" and wrote that it \"finds the great man swinging, emoting, cajoling and laughing his way through a selection of standards that he makes his own ... it exudes pure class.\"\n\nIt was voted number 390 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).\nIn 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"The Genius of Ray Charles\" number 263 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and 265 in a 2012 revised list. In a 2004 review for the magazine, Robert Christgau praised producers Jerry Wexler and Nesuhi Ertegun for persuading \"five different arrangers into the subtlest charts of Charles' career.\" Christgau asserted that \"Charles tried many times, but except for \"Modern Sounds\", he never again assembled such a consistent album in this mode.\" In \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" (2004), critics J. D. Considine and Michaelangelo Matos said that it is \"perhaps the most important of [Charles'] albums for Atlantic\", because it \"introduces the musical approach he would follow for much of the '70s.\" They argued that, instead of pursuing the contemporary sounds of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, or swing era big bands, Charles played a \"curious hybrid of the brassy R&B of his pop-oriented recordings and the showy shmaltz favored by the era's middle-of-the-road acts.\" However, they cautioned listeners that the album was \"abysmally recorded, with frequent overmodulation muddying its brasher moments.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was an acknowledged illegitimate son of King Christian V of Denmark and his officially acknowledged royal mistress Sophie Amalie Moth.\n\nWhen Gyldenløve was 6 years old, his father appointed him Governor of Iceland, then a Danish possession, a position that he held until his death, although he never visited the country.\n\nAlthough Frederick IV of Denmark strongly distrusted nobility, his half-brother, Ulrik Christian Gyldenløve became Lieutenant General Admiral of the Danish Fleet in 1697, ultimately going on to become Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. He is also recognized as the founder of the Royal Danish Naval Academy.\n\nBy the outbreak of the Great Northern War General-Admiral Gyldenløve and the fleet were ready for the confrontation, but to no avail. The allied fleets of Sweden, Britain and the Dutch Republic sailed into the Øresund, and, since they severely outnumbered the Danish fleet (61 ships of the line against 21), prevented the Danish fleet from interdicting the Swedish troop transports. Under the cover of these combined fleets, Charles XII of Sweden put troops ashore and bombarded Copenhagen, thus ending the early Danish participation in the Great Northern War. \n\nBy 1709, when the war resumed, Gyldenløve had risen in the organization. Under his command, late in the autumn of 1712 the North Squadron joined with the Baltic fleet. Lord High Admiral Gyldenløve had gathered the fleet to support the siege of Stralsund. This fleet attacked the Swedish fleet while they were offloading transports on 29 September; Gyldenløve's fleet fired 80 transport ships, making it impossible for Sweden to relieve Stralsund. This represented a notable victory. The fleet played a continued role in the siege of Stralsund, ultimately resulting in the loss of the city and the flight of Charles XII to Sweden.\n\n"}

In this context, the concept of \"industry\" is far-reaching: it includes agriculture, for instance. An example of invention which would \"not\" be susceptible of industrial application is \"a method of contraception [...] to be applied in the private and personal sphere of a human being\".\n\nIn United States patent law, the utility requirement is a more or less corresponding, but different, requirement.\n\nAt the European Patent Office (EPO), the requirement that an invention is susceptible of an industrial application has generally been taken to be more or less automatically fulfilled until a 2005 decision of the Boards of Appeal of the EPO saw this requirement analysed in new detail.

Boating plays an important part in the village's economy, and the village has a sailing club. It is also home to the Warsash Maritime Academy, part of Southampton Solent University, which provides training for Merchant Navy Officers from around the world.\n\nThe Locks Heath, Warsash and Whiteley urban area had a combined population of 43,359 according to 2011 Census. This also includes Park Gate and Swanwick and forms a subdivision of the South Hampshire built up area.\n\nWarsash is in the borough of Fareham, and is part of the Fareham parliamentary constituency. The village lies in the Hook-with-Warsash parish, with the hamlet of Hook.\n\nBefore the 19th century what is now known as Warsash was a number of separate hamlets; Warsash itself; Hook to the south at the mouth of the River Hamble; Newtown between Hook and Warsash and Chilling on Southampton Water. Hook was of earlier importance, as a 'dockyard' during the Hundred Years' War. At the end of this war Hook's importance declined, and for the next 300 years it, Chilling and Warsash continued as hamlets making livings from fishing and smuggling. Newtown had in addition a number of salterns.\n\nTowards the end of the 18th century the land around Hook had been acquired by the Hornby family to form the Hook Estate This new estate was bordered to the north by the existing Warsash House estate.\n\nIn 1807 the shipbuilder George Parsons, who had lost the lease of his former shipyard up-river at Bursledon, began construction of a shipyard at Warsash at a site where the present Shore Road was later built; all the buildings at the former Bursledon site, including a graving shed and a mould-loft, were dismantled and re-erected at Warsash In partnership with his son John Parsons and grandson John Rubie, Parsons then built a number of vessels during the following four years, including four ships for the Royal Navy - the 18-gun brig-sloop HMS \"Peruvian\" in 1808, the 36-gun frigates HMS \"Theban\" and HMS \"Hotspur\" in 1809 and 1810 , and the 38-gun frigate HMS \"Nymphe\" in 1812. Following George's death in 1812, his son and grandson built a further ship for the Navy - the 36-gun frigate HMS \"Laurel\".\n\nIn the 19th century Warsash started to expand in size and importance when shipbuilding moved across the river from Hamble-le-Rice. Along the coast Newtown was also expanding, the salterns had expanded into a chemical works and an iron smelting industry had started. By the mid-19th century the two communities had been linked by road, with housing along these roads filling the open space to create one community.\n\nBy the end of 19th century the lack of threat from the French had sent the shipbuilding industry into decline. The iron and chemical works were also declining. The main sources of income for the area were the burgeoning strawberry growing industry and traditional fishing and agriculture. Alongside these industries grew businesses providing refreshments and services to visitors to the area, especially those of the new leisure sailing pursuits. At the crossroads in the centre of the village there is an unusual clock tower built around 1900, an example of the prosperity the leisure industry brought.\n\nWarsash House Estate built a tower faced by a clock in the centre of the village to hold up to 6,000 gallons of water. In present days the water tower has been removed and the clock tower is a private residence.\n\nWarsash has 4 pubs within of each other. The Rising Sun on the shore front, The Ship and Shovel (previously The Ferryman and before that a popular jazz pub known as The Great Harry), The Jolly Farmer in Fleet End Road and The Silver Fern.\n\nThe parish church, St Mary's, dates from 1871. The old vicarage site on Osborne Road has been redeveloped and new houses erected. In 2000, local sculptor Ian G Brennan was commissioned to produce a bas-relief carving to be fitted above the entrance to the vestry. The finished piece is made of lime-wood and shows various landmarks of the village and a large dove of peace. The approach to the church (Church Road) was previously an undeveloped laurel avenue. Many of the hedges have been replaced by fences or walls but several are still flourishing. At the end of the road the mounting block still survives, at the site of the old avenue gates.\n\nOn 5 June 1944 British and allied commando units sailed from Warsash for the Normandy Landings. Some of the units were trained at HMS Tormentor.\n\nWarsash is the eastern landing-place for the ferry crossing the River Hamble from Hamble-le-Rice. The ferry was once an important link in a historic route between Portsmouth and Southampton. The ferry now provides a link in local, national and international footpaths such as the Solent Way and cycle routes such as National Cycle Route 2.\n\nThe ferry, a foot-passenger only service, is notable for its boats, each painted bright pink. The pink paint scheme is echoed on the shelter by the landing on the east bank of the river.\n\nThroughout the sixties and seventies the ferry was run by a Ray Sedgwick, a local boatman who hired boats out to tourists etc. The ferry hut on the Warsash side was built in the early 1900s by the Bugle pub who sold beer to other local pubs, the hut was used to store kegs as well as keeping travellers out of the rain.\n\nWarsash has one primary school, located in Church Road. This school, Hook-with-Warsash Academy, has outstanding ofstead ratings and is a feeder school to Brookfield Community School.\n\n"}

FSYO is the oldest operating youth symphony in the state of Florida and is believed to be the 3rd oldest in the southeastern United States. It was originally affiliated with the now-defunct Florida Symphony Orchestra.\n\nBoth new and returning student members are required to audition annually. Acceptance and orchestra placement is a competitive, merit-based process in which auditionees must meet requirements for consideration. The organization is under the musical direction of Hanrich Claassen.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Alphonse Carlo, who was both a Rollins College associate professor of music and the concertmaster of the newly-formed Florida Symphony Orchestra, recognized a need for a youth orchestra in Central Florida and worked for years to get one started. Although FSYO officially celebrates its founding as the fall of 1957, evidence supports that the youth orchestra was started 4 years earlier.  In September 1953, Mr. Carlo convinced the Orange County School Board to partner with the professional Florida Symphony Orchestra to provide string lessons and a youth orchestra for the area students.  The program included a “school” which offered free lessons on Saturday mornings for 1st and 2nd year string players as well as a youth orchestra for “those students who were sufficiently advanced.”  The first classes/rehearsals were held at Howard Junior High School on November 7, 1953.\n\nThe supporting co-sponsors changed a couple of times over the first 5 years of the fledgling program.  The Orlando Sentinel stepped in as a financial partner in 1955 and was later replaced by Rollins College through its School for the Creative Arts in 1958.  The strings school component appears to have been dropped sometime during the 1959-60 season, leaving just the youth orchestra that exists today.\n\nIn 1962, the program gained considerable structure and support under the full wing of the professional Florida Symphony Orchestra and its music director, Henry Mazer. In 1980, FSYO became independent by incorporating as a non-profit and received its 501(c)(3) charitable tax status in 1982.\n\nDespite its legal and financial independence in 1980, FSYO remained closely associated with the Florida Symphony Orchestra (FSO) until the professional orchestra ceased operations in 1993. Documents discovered in the Rollins College Dept. of Archives & Special Collections, show that while FSO provided the music staff and administration during the early years, the Rollins College School of Creative Arts (which has since closed) provided the funding for the expenses of running the youth orchestra, including paying for conductor salaries, music, rent, janitorial, etc. Although complete records are missing, receipts and archive concert programs show that this arrangement continued for approximately 20 years from the late 1950s until the late 1970s.\n\nAs evidenced from various old newspaper articles and archived concert programs, the youth orchestra changed its name 9 times since inception. All but one of the changes took place in the program's first 23 years. The earliest formation of the youth orchestra in 1953 was named the “Florida Symphony Student Orchestra.” But by 1956, it was being called the “Florida Youth Symphony.”  Today’s familiar name of the “Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra” came about In 1958.  However, it didn't last for long.\n\nIn 1962, new FSO music director Henry Mazer and the FSO organization, fully adopted the youth program and rebranded it as the “Florida Symphony Youth Training Orchestra,” and then later shortened it to the “Florida Symphony Training Orchestra.”  After Mazer left in the spring of 1966, the name was changed back to the “Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra” for a brief time.  Next came new FSO music director, Herman Hertz in 1967, who promptly changed the name to the “Florida Youth Symphony” and then later changed it again to “Florida Youth Orchestra.”  In 1976, the name was changed back to the original, “Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra” and it remained so for 41 years.   \n\nIn 2017, FSYO's Board of Directors voted to slightly change the name by replacing \"Orchestra\" with the plural, \"Orchestras,\" to better reflect the current size & breadth of the entire program.\n\n\n\n"}

Her debut was in 1995 under the guidance of 3p Records executive and mentor Moses Pelham, producer of her breakthrough single \"Ja Klar.\" Following the drop of her pseudonym and a number-one single, \"Du Liebst Mich Nicht,\" in 1997, a series of hit records established her position as Germany's \"best known and highest-selling female rap act\" to date.\n\nSetlur is the only artist to date to have ever won three ECHO Awards for \"Best National Female Artist.\" According to several sources, she has sold more than two million albums and singles domestically.\n\nHer most recent album was released in 2007.\n\nSetlur is the elder of two sisters born to Krishnan Setlur, a Kannadiga banker, and his wife Theresa, a Malayali nurse, in Frankfurt am Main, Hesse. She and her four-years-younger sister Yvonne were primarily raised in Bad Soden am Taunus, where Setlur became acquainted with future Rödelheim Hartreim Projekt members Thomas Hofmann and Moses Pelham in her high school years. After a spontaneous performance of Dr. Dre's \"Nuthin' But a \"G\" Thang\" in 1993 Hofmann and Pelham asked her to contribute a verse to the early Rödelheim Hartreim Projekt track \"Wenn Es Nicht Hart Ist.\" As she had never rapped before, Setlur reportedly hesitated; but soon accepted their invitation into the recording studio. Impressed by her talent, Pelham offered her a record contract with Pelham Power Productions, and as a result Setlur quit studying business administration and instead signed a deal with 3p Records.\n\nIn 1995, Setlur released the Moses Pelham-produced double A single \"Hier kommt die Schwester/Pass auf\" under the pseudonym Schwester S. Her breakthrough single was \"Ja klar\" from her debut album \"S ist soweit\" (ranking #11), which was released in February 1995.\nIn 1996 she won the ECHO award for \"Best Female Artist\". In addition, she began her own hip hop broadcast on the radio station hr3.\n\nAfter 3p's sudden major label change in 1997 Setlur released her second album \"Die Neue S-Klasse\" under her birth name in February of the same year. The album debuted at #10 on the albums chart and spawned Setlur's first and only #1 single \"Du Liebst Mich Nicht\", whose sales earned her another ECHO and a Comet award for \"Best Female Artist\" in 1998, as well as a golden record for more than 300.000 units sold. In the meantime Setlur was featured on the singles by Faithless' \"Bring My Family Back\" and then-newcomer Xavier Naidoo's \"Freisein\".\n\nIn 1999 Setlur's third album \"Aus der Sicht und mit den Worten von...\" outperformed the success of its predecessors when it peaked at #3 on the German albums chart. Though its singles could not link to previous accomplishments, the album's sales earned Setlur her third ECHO for \"Best Female Artist\" in 2000. A few months later Sabrina constantly hit the headlines when paparazzi revealed her relationship to former tennis star Boris Becker. The couple separated shortly afterwards, but due to conflicting rumours about anorexia Setlur's name maintained popular in magazines and papers. \"I was suddenly in the newspaper, not because of my job, only because we were together\", said Setlur in an interview with online magazine \"Spiegel Online\". \"Suddenly they wrote stuff about me, which hasn't something to do with my job.\"\n\nSetlur channeled much of her heavily media-discussed experiences into the production of her fourth studio album \"Sabs\". Released in November 2003, the CD received a mixed reception from most professional music critics, with \"Laut\" calling it \"a chavvy and antiquated [but] good rap album\" and \"CDStarts\" declaring it a \"insignificant [but] practiced comeback.\" Promoted by Setlur's engagement as a judge on the third installment of the German reality television series \"Popstars - Das Duell\" (which created both the male quartet Overground and the girl group Preluders), the album spawned four moderately successful singles, including \"Liebe\", a collaboration with Glashaus and labelmate Franziska. Setlur used to contend for the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 in Istanbul. Following several weeks of promotional appearances, Setlur entered the competition on March 19, 2004 with the album's second single, and although considered as a favourite by the media, Setlur failed to place within the top 5, eventually falling against singer Max Mutzke and his song \"Can't Wait Until Tonight.\"\n\nIn early 2005 she released a best of compilation, titled \"10 Jahre Sabrina Setlur\". The compilation album features all of her singles (by then fifteen) as well as the album tracks \"Ich bin raus\" (taken from \"S ist soweit\") and \"Ohne Worte\" (from \"Aus der Sicht und mit den Worten von...\") but did not include new material. The song \"Mein Herz\", originally released on \"Sabs\", was used as single to promote the album.\n\nReturning from yet another musical hiatus, Setlur's fifth studio album \"Rot\" was released on August 24, 2007.\n\nIn May 2016, veteran band Kraftwerk lost a 19-year copyright infringement legal suit against Setlur, for her use of a two-second sample from the song \"Metal on Metal\" on their 1977 album \"Trans-Europe Express\" in her 1997 song \"Nur mir\".\n\n\n"}

He was formerly chief executive of the major British jewellery company Ratners Group (now the Signet Group). He achieved notoriety after making a speech in which he jokingly denigrated two of the company's products. He currently speaks around the world at corporate and promotional events.\n\nGerald Ratner was born in London to a Jewish family and based his philosophy of business on his experiences as a boy in Petticoat Lane Market. He observed that \"the people who shouted the loudest and appeared to give the best offers sold the most.\"\n\nHis sister Denise Ratner was married to stockbroker Anthony Parnes, one of the \"Guiness four\".\n\nRatner joined the family business in 1966 and built up an extremely successful chain of jewellers during the 1980s, of which he was chief executive. The shops shocked the formerly staid jewellery industry by displaying fluorescent orange posters advertising cut-price bargains and by offering low price ranges. The Ratners Group consisted of Ratners, H. Samuel, Ernest Jones, Leslie Davis, Watches of Switzerland and over 1000 shops in the US including Kays. \n\nAlthough widely regarded as \"tacky\", the shops and their wares were nevertheless extremely popular with the public, until Ratner made a speech addressing a conference of the Institute of Directors at the Royal Albert Hall on 23 April 1991. During the speech, he commented:\n\nHe compounded this by going on to remark that one of the sets of earrings was \"cheaper than an M&S prawn sandwich but probably wouldn't last as long.\" Ratner's comments have become textbook examples of why chief executives should choose their words carefully. In the furore that ensued, customers stayed away from Ratner shops. After the speech, the value of the Ratner group plummeted by around £500 million, which very nearly resulted in the firm's collapse. Ratner hired a chairman in an attempt to stabilise the situation, but was subsequently fired by the new company leader in November 1992. The group then changed its name to Signet Group in September 1993.\n\nToday, Ratner's speech is still famous in the corporate world as an example of the value of branding and image over quality. Such gaffes are now sometimes called \"doing a Ratner\", and Ratner himself has acquired the sobriquet \"The Sultan of Bling\". Ratner has said in his defence that his remarks were not meant to be taken seriously. He also largely blamed the aggressiveness and deliberately wrongful interpretation of several media outlets for the severe consumer reaction.\n\nFollowing an unsuccessful attempt to become a jewellery consultant in France during the mid-1990s, he set up a health club in Henley-on-Thames in 1996, which was sold for £3.9m in 2001. Ratner now runs, in collaboration with SB&T International Ltd, an export manufacturing company based in India and the online jewellery business Gerald Online.\nIn 2013, during a visit to India for the inaugural eTailing India Expo, Ratner announced that he would be entering the Indian market.\n\nRatner has two daughters from his first marriage. According to Ratner, \"my first wife left me because I was never at home.\"\n\nHe is now married to Moira, and they live in Cookham, Berkshire. They have a daughter and a son.\n"}

The old neighbourhood of Risskov at the seaside of the Aarhus Bay, is one of the most affluent areas in Denmark. \n\nThe name of Risskov literally means \"The Forest of Riis\", as described on the memorial stone marking the entrance to the area and derives from the small local forest of Riis Skov. The southern parts of the forest was granted to the city of Aarhus by Margaret I of Denmark as the first, Danish public forest. In 1542, Christian III of Denmark granted the northern part of the forest to Aarhus as well. From early on, the forest was used for leisurely activities, and during the 1800s, restaurants, entertainment parks and musical pavilions sprung up in different parts of the woodland. Today the forest is known for its sharp smell of ramson in the spring and its abundance of anemones. It is still a popular destination for families and couples. Supposedly the ramson was brought to Denmark by Spanish soldiers, who then brought it to the forest of Riis Skov in 1808, during the Napoleonic Wars. In October 1951, a meteorite exploded in the atmosphere over Denmark and the largest piece of it, about the size of a clenched fist, was recovered in Riis Skov, where a memorial stone now commemorates the event.\n\nToday the neighbourhood of Risskov is an affluent suburban area, with many large mansions and detached houses in connectivity with the sandy beaches of Bellevue and the woodland park of Riis Skov in the south. \n\nNotable sights in Risskov include:\n\nThe beaches at Risskov, presents a beautiful panoramic view of the Bay of Aarhus, with Samsø, Helgenæs and Mols visible on the horizon on most days.\n\nWriter Svend Aage Madsen has written many stories about Aarhus and Risskov, where he resides himself.

{"id": "1821848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821848", "title": "Jonathan May", "text": "Jonathan May\n\nJonathan May (October 9, 1958 – February 27, 2010) was an American cellist and conductor. He resided in the Orlando, Florida area and was noted for founding and directing numerous youth orchestras and music programs throughout the region.\n\nOne of seven children, May was born in Eau Claire, Wisconsin to Walter and Eleanor May, each an accomplished musician and teacher. At the age of four, the family moved to Fairport, New York where Jonathan would learn to play the cello at a young age. He was a student of Lynn Richmond and played in the Rochester Youth Symphony. When Jonathan was in high school, the family moved, to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He earned a bachelor's degree at Augustana College in Sioux Falls, where his father was chairman of the music department. During this time, he met his future wife, Maureen Getting, also an accomplished cellist and student of his mother. Jonathan received his master's degree at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, where he and Maureen would begin a lifelong pursuit of teaching music that would take them across the country.\n\nThe May family moved to Central Florida in the early 1990s, where Jonathan would join the faculty of Stetson University in DeLand. As his reputation as a music teacher in the region grew, he was made Artistic Director of the Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra in 1994. When May assumed artistic control of the 90-piece youth orchestra, it consisted of two orchestras of students representing 45 schools from eight counties in Central Florida; just three years later the orchestra grew to over 200 students and four divisions ranging from beginner to a top-level symphony. In 1997, he would lead the orchestra on a tour of Australia, which culminated in a performance at the Sidney Opera House. The same year May would also help form and lead the Daytona Beach Youth Orchestra at Daytona Beach Community College, where he was also a professor.\n\nMay would continue successfully leading the FSYO until 1998, when a split occurred among orchestra board members over the artistic direction of the orchestra. May was reportedly forced out of critical artistic choices by FSYO board members who sought to widen their artistic direction and exclude him from the orchestra's audition process. As May would explain to the \"Orlando Sentinel\": \"What this is is a difference of philosophy. One is a strong musical director with a supporting board; the other is a weak musical director and a strong board calling the shots.\" Not content with assuming the role of a weak musical director, May would form a competing orchestra with former FSYO board members and supporters. Though this period marked a fractious time for the youth orchestra movement in Central Florida, with some patrons claiming there were not enough students, venues, or funding to support another youth orchestra in the Orlando area, May remained undaunted and would answer these concerns with his familiar humor and a prophetic movie quote: \"If you build it, they will come.\"\n\nMay founded the Florida Young Artists Orchestra in 1998 in Orlando. May's leadership helped oversee its growth into five separate orchestras composed of about 200 students (ages 6–22) from several Central Florida counties. He was also the founder and director of the strings program at Park Maitland School in Maitland, Florida and Trinity Preparatory School in Winter Park, Florida, where he was also the composition teacher.\n\nWhat began as a strings program started by May in 1994 would become the Central Florida Youth Orchestra in 2001, which met at Lake-Sumter Community College in Leesburg; May served as Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of the group of young musicians aged 6–19 spanning beginner, intermediate, and advanced ability. In just a few years the orchestra would grow to five groups and increasingly become known for its inclusiveness, as no student was denied the opportunity to learn music, as well as May's relentless efforts to raise awareness about the value of an orchestral education to children of the Central Florida community.\n\nAs dedicated member of the Central Florida community, May devoted a great deal of his time bringing music to those that might not otherwise have the opportunity. Like he did in Lake County, May would form an orchestral program in Flagler County where none had existed previously. Beginning in 2001 as a small strings program of a dozen musicians known as the Flagler Symphonic Society, with the help of Flagler County school system the program grew in 2005 into the Flagler Youth Orchestra of Palm Coast, Florida. May served as Artistic Director of the after-school music-education program, which was available free of charge to all Flagler County public, private and home-schooled students. May would lead 125 students in the first year and the program would quickly grow to become the largest performing arts program in Flagler County, with routine enrollment of 300 or more students every year. May's reputation for inclusiveness and excellence in music education would continue to grow each year and with each new orchestra and music program he founded.\n\nUnder his guidance, and as part of his desire to provide students with the most comprehensive orchestra experience, May's orchestras often performed with professional guest soloists and in venues across the globe, including in Australia, England, Scotland, throughout Austria, in major Italian venues in Milan, Fiesole, and at the Academy of Music at Santa Cecelia. May also worked with professional orchestras in Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, and Florida and returned to Prague as guest conductor of that city's Symphony Orchestra.\n\nOn Sunday, June 15, 2008 (Father's Day), May would take 110 student musicians from all his orchestras to perform on the most revered stage in music, the Isaac Stern Auditorium / Ronald O. Perelman Stage of Carnegie Hall in New York City, as part of the venue's \"Ensemble Spotlight Series\". Members from the Central Florida Youth Orchestra, Daytona Beach Youth Orchestra, Flagler Youth Orchestra, and Florida Young Artists Orchestra would combine to form the Florida Festival Youth Orchestra. May appeared with the orchestra on the CBS Early Show and the trip culminated with orchestra performing before a large, enthusiastic crowd in Carnegie Hall. May conducted the orchestra as they performed three works commissioned especially for the event: \"The Phoenix Rising\" by Stella Sung, \"Alligator Songs\" by May's brother, composer Daniel May, and \"The Ponce De Leon Suite\" by Robert Kerr. The orchestra would receive several standing ovations throughout the program. Always conscious of the difficulties of funding the arts but never doubting the need to do so, May and his orchestras sought to raise money for their trip by doing what they did best and holding performances for the community, as he told the press: \"Selling cookies is not what we do. If people wonder why this is a worthy cause, they can come and listen.\"\n\nOn February 26, 2010 Jonathan Paul May suffered a sudden brain bleed and died at 2:45pm the next afternoon, February 27, 2010, age 51. His public memorial at Northland Church in Longwood, Florida was attended by over 1,700 admirers, friends, students and colleagues. He had four children, Emily (b. 1987), Elliot (b. 1988), Allison (b. 1990), and Nathan (b. 1994), and was married to Maureen May, a cellist with the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra, the Bach Festival, as well as a teacher of strings at Millennium Middle School and Trinity Preparatory School. The last piece May ever conducted was \"Dona nobis pacem\" (Grant Us Peace) with the students at Park Maitland.\n\nDuring May's quarter century as a music professional and teacher, he worked with orchestras all over the world as both a musician and conductor. May was the Artistic Director of the Academy of Music at Schloss-Ort, Gmunden, Upper Austria, where he performed as cellist and conductor. He was also recognized by his peers and several organizations for his superior work, including winning the Teachers Who Make a Difference Award, and an ASCAP award at the American Symphony Orchestra League's annual conference. In addition to his orchestras and programs, May maintained a private studio and all told taught well over 1,000 students each week.\n\nKnown to his students and colleagues as a magnetic personality who was always quick with a joke or bad pun, his passion for educating students of music was infectious. Referred to as \"the Johnny Appleseed of music\" by his brother, composer Daniel May, he sought to create musical opportunities for students wherever he saw an opening. May would not only create a large number of youth orchestras and music programs in Florida, but would also inspire other musicians and music teachers to do the same, leading directly to the creation of orchestras all over the country.\n\nIn the often-political world of youth orchestras, he retained an insouciance and positive attitude that allowed him to focus on the music education of his students over politics or status. May was well known for a motto, often used as a mantra to help educate his students about dealing with musical changes: \"You must…\" he would say. \"Adjust!\" they would respond. As with all of May's musical lessons, these words would apply as much to life as to music.\n\nSince May's death, many Central Florida concerts and performances have been dedicated to his honor. The Central Florida Youth Orchestra, the Flagler Youth Orchestra, and the Trinity Prep Theater Department all dedicated performances to May. The Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra (OPO) also dedicated the first number of its \"Myth and Poetry\" program on November 1, 2010 to May; \"The Phoenix Rising\", composed by May's friend and OPO's composer-in-residence Stella Sung, was originally commissioned by May for his youth orchestra. Upon completion of the emotional piece, OPO conductor Christopher Wilkins embraced Maureen May, who plays cello in the orchestra. Additional tributes to May have been planned by the CFYO, the FYO, and the Metropolitan Area Youth Symphony.\n\nMay 1st has been designated by the government of Orange County, Florida as Mr. Jonathan May Day. The first celebration was held May 1, 2010 at Trinity Preparatory School in Winter Park, Florida, and events are planned annually in Central Florida to honor and celebrate May's love and lifelong commitment to music education.\n\nOn May 14, 2011, the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra honored May at its concert featuring violinist Joshua Bell with the world premiere performance of a commissioned work by May's brother, Daniel. The piece, \"Tall and Small\", was named to reflect the wide impact May's passion for music had on children and adults alike. The professional OPO musicians were joined onstage by 30–35 student musicians of all skill levels that worked with or were inspired by May. The \"Make Music-Make History\" competition continued through April 1, 2011 with live audition recordings conducted by the Metropolitan Area Youth Symphony in March. The sold-out concert began with \"The Tall and the Small,\" a 12-minute piece that the \"Orlando Sentinel\" reviewed as \"reminiscent of that moment when the sun emerges after a long stretch of rain.\" The OPO was accompanied by a 36-member youth ensemble that featured two of May's children, as well as his wife, Maureen, who was seated in front of the orchestra and played an emotional cello solo on Jonathan's cello.\n\nIn 2012, tributes to Jonathan May continued to be made throughout Central Florida. The CFYO renamed its annual season finale concert \"MAYFEST\" to serve as a tribute to its former leader. After honoring May's memory in 2011 with a February 28 performance at the cold-weather shelter at First United Methodist Church in Bunnell, Florida, the Flagler Youth Orchestra honored May's memory in 2012 with a day-long tour of assisted and independent living facilities in Palm Coast on the weekend before Jonathan May Day.\n\nIn 2010, May was named as honorary founder of the Metropolitan Area Youth Symphony (MAYS) in the Orlando area, founded by his wife, Maureen, and longtime friend, colleague, and fellow conductor, Michael Miller of The Geneva School in Winter Park, with his daughter Emily serving as program organizer. The MAYS sets out to continue May's inclusive music educational philosophy, and states about him on the orchestra website: \"The MAYS is dedicated to his honor and maintaining the high musical, educational, and ethical ideals that he brought with him to each of his orchestras and students.\n\nThe Jonathan May Foundation was formed in 2012 to encourage participation in youth orchestra by providing scholarships and assistance to MAYS and the students in all of its orchestras and programs. The nonprofit foundation sponsors free MAYS concerts throughout the season, as well as the season finale MAYSfest, which features all the students from each MAYS orchestra and program.\n\n"}

It is located east of the Singapore River—across from Chinatown, located west of the river—and north of Kampong Glam. Both areas are part of the urban planning area of Rochor. Little India is commonly known as \"Tekka\" in the Indian Singaporean community.\n\nLittle India is distinct from the Chulia Kampong area, which, under the Raffles Plan of Singapore, was originally a division of colonial Singapore where ethnic Indian immigrants would reside under the British policy of ethnic segregation. However, as Chulia Kampong became more crowded and competition for land escalated, many ethnic Indians moved into what is now known as Little India. (The Chulia Kampong district no longer exists as a distinct area.)\n\nThe Little India area is reported to have developed around a former settlement for Indian convicts. Its location along the Serangoon River originally made it attractive for raising cattle, and trade in livestock was once prominent in the area. Eventually, other economic activity developed, and by the turn of the 20th century, the area began to look like an ethnic Indian neighbourhood.\n\nLittle India was the site of a two-hour-long riot that occurred on 8 December 2013, after a man was killed in a traffic accident. 27 people were injured, and 40 people were arrested.\n\nAlthough ethnic Indians no longer tend to stay solely segregated in one place as previously arranged under the modern People's Action Party (PAP) policy of racial harmony, for the sake of cultural heritage, many of the ethnically Indian commercial or cottage industry usages are concentrated in Little India, although Indian-dominant commercial zones are also found in HDB estates. Contrary to stereotypes, Little India is not solely an Indian neighbourhood. Located in the neighbourhood alongside shops that cater predominantly to the Indians are Chinese clan associations, places of worship of different religions, and a variety of different business ranging from electrical supplies, hardware, second-hand goods alongside traditional spice grinders and grocers. One of the more prominent examples of cross-cultural patronage besides those regarding food is that many Chinese parents go to shops in Little India to grind rice to make congee for infants. The machinery used in this instance was initially flown in from India to grind spices into powder for use in Indian cuisine. Little India differs from many other neighbourhoods in Singapore in many ways. Tekka Market is also multi-cultural, with produce and sundries that cater to the many ethnic groups in Singapore.\n\nSerangoon Road is the main commercial thoroughfare in Little India. It intersects Rochor Canal Road and Bukit Timah Sungei Road. Along Serangoon Road is the Tekka Centre, the Tekka Mall, the Little India Arcade, Serangoon Plaza, and the Mustafa Centre (on a side-road). Farrer Park Fields is located in the district. Several Hindu temples, mosques, and other place of worship include Far Kor Sun Monkey God Temple (花果山福广宫), Foochow Methodist Church, Kampong Kapor Methodist Church which was completed in 1929, Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, Angullia Mosque, Sri Vadapathira Kaliamman Temple, Jalan Mosque, and the Central Sikh Gurdwara. \n\nThe Abdul Gafoor Mosque, built in 1859 and named after a Tamil lawyer's clerk, features Arabian- and Renaissance-style architecture. Its prayer hall, decorated with Moorish arch-work, displays a tableau featuring the history of the Islamic religion. The Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple, along Serangoon Road, features a high gopuram (tower), and was built in 1855. The Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple, also along Serangoon Road, originally established by Thai monk Vuthisasara in 1927.

Although he tried his luck as a film actor, he did not succeed a great deal in acting.\n\nTalat received Padma Bhushan in 1992, in recognition of his artistic contributions in the spheres of cinematic and ghazal music. he had a unique, elegant and profoundly artistic style of singing. Talat was a very gifted singer in every sense. He was particularly famous for singing soft and sombre semi-classical and non-classical \"ghazal\"s, but the film songs sung by him are also considered critically flawless and outstanding. Although Talat's typical genre was Ghazal, he was an astoundingly brilliant film singer who sung innumerable fantastic film songs.\n\nRomantic and tragic were the moods he liked most and it was he who helped a great deal in shaping the style and method of modern ghazal singing. He can be described as the real founder of modern semi-classical and non-classical ghazal. During the 1950s and 60s, Talat was the first choice of the high-brow literary and artistic community of Indian sub-continent, especially Urdu-speaking community. Even his cancelled songs were immensely popular among them. No other singer had such intellectually high-class and learned audience at the time with an exception of Manna Dey. Talat's voice has often been described as the softest male voice of the Indian sub-continent; not only this, but his voice is also considered among the most soulful male voices ever heard in the Indian sub-continent.\n\nTalat Mahmood was born in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, to Manzoor Mahmood. Talat showed his musical leanings from a very young age and would enjoy sitting through all-night music soirees listening patiently to some of the biggest names in classical Indian music then.\n\nComing from a conservative Muslim background, singing was not encouraged. Talat had to choose between working in films and staying at home. Despite his parental objection he opted for the former, though his family accepted the fact only about a decade later when he gained respect in the industry.\n\nTalat apprenticed classical music under Pandit S.C.R. Bhat at Marris College of Music, Lucknow (presently Bhatkhande Music Institute) some time in late-30s. He started his career purely as a \"ghazal\" singer in 1939. Talat Mahmood began his singing career at the age of 16 in 1939 when he began singing the \"Ghazal\"s of Daag, Mir, Jigar etc. on All India Radio, Lucknow. His voice had a quality distinct from all the other singers. HMV was quick to notice this and offered Talat his first disc in 1941 \"Sab din ek samaan nahin tha, Bun jaoon ga kya se kya main, Iska to kuch dhyan nahin tha\".\n\nHis reputation as a \"ghazal\" singer was not limited to his hometown of Lucknow, but it reached the city that proved to shape his destiny – Calcutta. The then famous \"ghazal\" singers were Ustad Barkat Ali Khan, K.L. Saigal and M.A. Rauf. The classical songs he sang were \"Sapnon Ki Suhaani Duniyaa Ko\" for film \"Shikast\" and \"Laage Tose Naina\" for \"Chaandi Ki Deewar\".\n\nIn 1944 came the hit \"Tasveer teri dil mera behela nah sake gi\". Its popularity was so phenomenal and unrivalled that even today it remains one of the top selling non-film discs. This disc brought Talat the fame throughout India and soon he was beckoned by the Calcutta film industry. Talat made cameo appearances and starred in about 16 films, for both the Calcutta (film hub of the 1940s) and Bombay Film Industry. The three films in which he starred were regional hits in Calcutta. Initially, in Calcutta, he recorded a lot of Bangla songs (basic album) under the assumed name of \"Tapankumar\". Several of his Bangla numbers were super hits in Bengal and are still aired on All India Radio old song reminisces. He sang to the tune of eminent music directors like Kamal Dasgupta [\"Du'ti paakhi du'ti teere... \"], Sudhin Dasgupta [\"Ei rimjhimjhim barosha...\"], Rabin Chattopadhyayaa [\"Chander eto aalo...\"], Hemanta Mukhopadhayay [\"E Jodi aakash hoy...\"] and V. Balsara [\"Tumi sundar jodi nahi...\"] during the 50s and early 60s.\n\nIn 1949 Talat moved to Bombay, to sing for the Hindi film industry. His name and fame had already preceded him and soon he was flooded with offers. His big break came with the song \"Ae dil mujhe aisi jagha le chal jahan koi na ho\" composed by music director Anil Biswas for the soundtrack of the film \"Arzoo\". The song proved to be extremely popular.\n\nLaxmikant Pyarelal, The most prolific duo of Hindi Film Music were also great fan of Talat Mahboob's silky voice. They composed an extremely melodious duet with Lata Mangeshkar in 1971 film \"Woh Din Yaad Karo\", this happened to be his last song in Hindi films.\n\nTalat Mehmood was the real founder of modern semi-classical and non-classical ghazal. So, his influence upon other contemporary and succeeding ghazal singers has been broad and profound. It was he who paved the way for such legendary ghazal singers as \"Mehdi Hassan\" and \"Jagjit Singh\". Hence he will always be placed very high for his contributions to transform and revitalize the whole art and form ghazal singing.\n\nTalat Mehmood can safely be placed among the greatest male gazal and/or film singers of the Indian subcontinent together with the singers like K. L. Saigal, Mohammed Rafi, Ahmed Rushdi, Mehdi Hassan, Manna Dey, Mahendra Kapoor, Ustad Amanat Ali Khan, Kishore Kumar, Jagjit Singh, Ustad Ghulam Ali and Mukesh. Because of his soft and silky voice, subtly intricate and detailed method, correct pronunciation, infallible striking of the notes that are being tried, very sound knowledge of Indian music, striking the right note on the right time, and never missing a single bit of a beat, Talat conquered the souls of countless people throughout the globe, wherever Urdu and Hindi are spoken and understood. He is particularly and immensely popular among learned Urdu-speaking audiences having literary or artistic background, especially in Pakistan.\n\nTalat was a member of the famous male singers' troika of the 1950s who had their respective separate fan-followings throughout the Indian subcontinent, the other two were Muhammad Rafi and Mukesh. This famous troika was the most popular group of the film singers of the 1950s in the entire sub-continent, who enjoyed the largest audience ever existed during any period of sub-continent's cinematic history. Talat exerted a profound influence upon the ghazal singing of his time with his immensely melodious voice and artistic craftsmanship, particularly suitable for typically semi-classical ghazal singing. He was born to be a Ghazal singer, with his majestic style and brilliant diction he conquered not only the hearts of innumerable high-brow listeners but also common folks of his time. He was the heart-favorite singer of the older and maturer audience of his time, and this type of audience still listens to him more than any of the ghazal singers who ever sung except the Shahenshah-e-Ghazal Mehdi Hassan and Jagjit Singh. So, in a sense, he still necessarily is a member of another troika, to be more precise, the three most influential ghazal singers of all time.\n\nTalat particularly and profoundly influenced a whole generation of young singers who succeeded him; including legendary ghazal singers Jagjit Singh and Pankaj Udhas (who always honors him with the title of Shahenshah-E-Ghazal), singer Sajjad Ali and playback singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya..\n\nG. M. Durrani was a model to many playback singers who followed then. The soulful renditions of Durrani were to be reminded of by Talat's singing as well.\n\nBesides being a gifted singer, Mahmood was quite handsome as well. He acted in over a dozen films with top actresses of the time like Nutan, Mala Sinha, Suraiya and others. Later he decided to give up acting to concentrate on singing.\n\nTalat acted in the following Hindi films:\n\nThe advent of rock-n-roll in the late 1960s sidelined singers like Talat. As long as he was top box-office draw, the film producers insisted on including his songs in their films. Talat's velvety vocals posed a special challenge to the music-composers, most of whom leaned towards the deep baritones of Mohammad Rafi and Mukesh. The resultant demise of his film career led to the decline of his singing career. At the same time, the social changes and happiness brought about by increasing prosperity in India meant that blue mood ghazals and heart-rending ballads were not popular any more. Talat continued to record good songs, but less in number. His last soundtrack recording, in 1985, is the song \"Mere Shareek-e-Safar\", a duet sung with Miss Hemlata, from the film \"Wali-e-Azam\" composed by Chitragupt and written by Ahmed Wasi.\n\nHowever, Talat who was the first Indian singer to go on foreign concert tours in 1956 to East Africa found eager fans awaiting his arrival in other foreign countries. Jam packed audience in the United States, the UK, West Indies and other countries awaited his arrival enthusiastically. He performed in famous Royal Albert Hall in London, Madison Square Garden in the States and Jean Pierre Complex in the West Indies. He continued singing in the packed auditoriums until 1991 when he toured the Netherlands. Talat sang about 800 songs in his long career. His songs are still popular among the music lovers as they were in the days these were released.\n\nTalat married a Bengali Christian girl from Calcutta, who also acted in films and was a great fan of his, Latika Mullick, later named Nasreen on 20 February 1951 and had two children Khalid born in 1953 and Sabina born in 1959\n\nPeople, who were close to Talat, describe his nature as a quiet one. He is often remarked as a decent man, and his velvety and silky voice also reflected that decency and sense of calmness. Music directors, who worked with him, claimed that while listening to him, one would develop the feeling that Talat was a soft-hearted man. Dilip Kumar termed Talat as \"a perfect gentleman\". He was a fine gentleman who always had time and respect for his admirers.\n\nTalat sang approximately 800 songs spread over 4 decades spanning between the 40s and 80s. Some of the most popular work of Talat is available even today with the following titles:\n\n\nEven though Talat sang hundreds of hits, some of his most memorable songs from Indian cinema are:\n\n"}

He ruled a vast territory from the Hindu-Kush to the Punjab around 170 BCE. He was almost certainly the eponymous son of Antimachus I, who is known from a unique preserved tax receipt. Bopearachchi dated Antimachus II to 160–155 BCE on numismatical grounds, but changed this to 174–165 BCE after the tax receipt was revealed to synchronise his reign with that of Antimachus I. R. C. Senior has not dated Antimachus II but thinks that his coins were possibly Indian issues of Antimachus I, despite their different epithets and coin types.\n\nIn both of Boperachchi's reconstructions, Antimachus II was succeeded by Menander I who inherited three of his four monograms. Antimachus II probably fought against the Bactrian king Eucratides I, who had dethroned his father in Bactria.\n\nAntimachus II did not strike a portrait on his coins, likely since this was not custom in India. Neither did the early kings strike tetradrachms. Antimachus II struck a large number of bilingual drachms on the same lighter Indian standard as Apollodotus I, though round in shape. On the obverse is Nike, and on the reverse a king on horseback.\n\nHe also issued bilingual bronzes with aegis / laurel wreath and palm.

Founded in 1812, it is the oldest historical society in the United States with a national focus. Its main building, known as Antiquarian Hall, is a U.S. National Historic Landmark in recognition of this legacy. The mission of the AAS is to collect, preserve and make available for study all printed records of what is now known as the United States of America. This includes materials from the first European settlement through the year 1876.\n\nThe AAS offers programs for professional scholars, pre-collegiate, undergraduate and graduate students, educators, professional artists, writers, genealogists, and the general public. AAS has many digital collections available, including \"A New Nation Votes: American Election Returns 1788–1824.\"\n\nThe collections of the AAS contain over three million books, pamphlets, newspapers, periodicals, graphic arts materials and manuscripts. The Society is estimated to hold copies of two-thirds of the total books known to have been printed in what is now the United States from the establishment of the first press in 1640 through the year 1820; many of these volumes are exceedingly rare and a number of them are unique. Historic materials from all fifty U.S. states, most of Canada and the British West Indies are included in the AAS repository. One of the more famous volumes held by the Society is a copy of the first book printed in America, the Bay Psalm Book. AAS also has one of the largest collections of newspapers printed in America through 1876, with more than two million issues in its collection.\n\nOn the initiative of Isaiah Thomas, the AAS was founded on October 24, 1812, through an act of the Massachusetts General Court. It was the third historical society established in America, and the first to be national in its scope. Isaiah Thomas started the collection with approximately 8,000 books from his personal library. The first library building was erected in 1820 in downtown Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1853, the Society moved its collections to a larger building at the corner of Highland Street, also in Worcester. This building was later abandoned and another new building was constructed. Designed by Winslow, Bigelow & Wadsworth, the Georgian Revival building was completed in 1910 and stands on the corner of Park Avenue and Salisbury Street. There have been several additions to this building to accommodate the growing collection, the most recent of which was completed in 2003. AAS was presented with the 2013 National Humanities Medal by President Obama in a ceremony at the White House.\n\nAs part of AAS's mission as a learned society, it offers a variety of public lectures and seminars. One topic to which AAS dedicates significant academic energies is printing technology, especially in eighteenth-century British North America. Since Isaiah Thomas was a newspaper man himself, he collected a large number of printed materials. With regard to printing, paper making, edition setting, and reprinting, not much had changed in European technology by the eighteenth century. It was not until the late eighteenth century that paper-making material began to evolve from a hand-woven cloth to an industrial pulp. AAS undertakes special efforts to preserve printed records from this time period, as the Society maintains an on-site conservation department with various sewing, cloth, and binding materials to aid in the preservation process.\n\nThe American Antiquarian Society's membership includes scholars, writers, journalists, filmmakers, collectors, American presidents, and civic leaders.

The race began as a fight between Chiarelli and Munter, with Munter getting the edge and 2003 candidate Terry Kilrea in a close third. However, in the summer O'Brien joined the campaign, prompting Kilrea to drop out and endorse Chiarelli. However, most of Kilrea's support went to O'Brien, creating a tight three-way race.

At an altitude of 1437 meters above sea level, Andermatt is located at the center of the Saint-Gotthard Massif and the historical center cross of north-south and east-west traverses of Switzerland. It is some south of Altdorf, the capital of Uri.\n\nAndermatt is in the Urseren valley, on the headwaters of the river Reuss and surrounded by the Adula Alps. Immediately to the north of Andermatt, the Reuss flows through the steeply descending Schöllenen Gorge (or \"the Schöllenen\") to Göschenen and further down the Reuss Valley to the north. It then flows, near Altdorf, into the Urnersee, part of Lake Lucerne. In the other three directions, the valley is linked by three Alpine passes: the Oberalp Pass (6,706 ft; 2,044 m.) to the east, the St Gotthard Pass (6,909 ft; 2,106 m.) to the south and the Furka Pass (7,992 ft; 2,436 m.) to the west.\n\nAndermatt has an area, , of . Of this area, 40.8% is used for agricultural purposes, while 5.5% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 1.7% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (52%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains). , 0.4% of the total land area was heavily forested, while 5.1% is covered in small trees and shrubbery. Of the agricultural land, 4.3% is used for orchards or vine crops and 36.5% is used for alpine pastures. Of the settled areas, 0.5% is covered with buildings, and 1.1% is transportation infrastructure. Of the unproductive areas, 0.5% is unproductive standing water (ponds or lakes), 1.0% is unproductive flowing water (rivers), 30.9% is too rocky for vegetation, and 19.7% is other unproductive land.\n\nAndermatt serves as a crossroads between southern Switzerland and the north as well as between eastern Switzerland (i.e. Graubünden/Grisons) and western Switzerland, (i.e. Valais, Bern and the Swiss Romande). The village is connected by three Alpine passes: the Oberalp Pass (6,706 ft; 2,044 m.) to the east connecting the Surselva in the canton of Graubünden, the St Gotthard Pass (6,909 ft; 2,106 m.) to the south connecting with the Valle Leventina in canton of Ticino, and the Furka Pass (7,992 ft; 2,436 m.) to the west connecting with the Obergoms in canton of Valais. To the north the steeply descending Schöllenen Gorge links Andermatt with Göschenen and is the location of the famous Devil's Bridge.\n\nSince the opening of the Schöllenen route, around 1200, Andermatt has been on the Gotthard route.\n\nThe town is served by a Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn (MGB) owned and operated railway station. The station is connected with Brig and Visp (Valais) and with the western terminus of the Rhaetian Railway at Disentis/Mustér (Grisons). There is also a very short branch line, the Schöllenenbahn, nowadays part of MGB, between Andermatt and Göschenen, at the northern end of the Gotthard Rail Tunnel, connecting with the Gotthard railway line.\n\nArchaeological finds dating back to 4000 BC indicate that the Urseren was already populated in the Neolithic period. During Roman times this Alpine valley was probably inhabited by some Helvetic Celtic tribes. However, the origins of Andermatt can only be traced back to Alemannic tribes, the Walsers, who established settlements in the area, where the current town of Andermatt is situated.\nThe parish of Andermatt was not mentioned until 1203; it was held by the Benedictine Disentis Abbey. This first mention refers to it as \"de Prato\". In 1290 it was mentioned as \"A der Matte\". In 1649, with the emergence of an independent Swiss Confederation, the ecclesiastical rights of the Disentis monastery were revoked in favour of civil legislation.\n\nIn the Flight of the Earls, Irish earls lost a fortune in gold at the Devil's Bridge crossing ravine on St Patrick's Day 1608. It has never been recovered and is known as the Lost Treasure of the St Gotthard Pass.\n\nNearby Schöllenen Gorge is the site of a memorial commemorating the 1799 campaign of the Russian general Alexander Suvorov.\n\nBetween 1818-1831 the nearby St Gotthard Pass was made accessible to stagecoaches. As the last resort before the pass, Andermatt flourished economically and became a popular spa town.\n\nThe opening, in 1881, of the St Gotthard railway tunnel, however, reversed its fortunes as the tunnel runs immediately beneath the town, connecting the Central Swiss town Göschenen with Airolo in Ticino. Some Andermattians who worked on the tunnel were killed during its construction.

The Grand Hotel Bellevue, which was built by the aristocratic Müller family from neighbouring Hospental (who at one time or another owned many other hotels nearby including the Hotel Furkablick and Hotel Furka Passhöhe - as well as hotels in Flüelen, Alpnachstad, Herisau and Neuchâtel) was converted in the 1970s into apartments, but by 1990 had been abandoned and was demolished with explosives. By the turn of the 21st century, as an alternative to the expensive skiing resorts in the Grisons (Graubünden) at St Moritz and Gstaad, Andermatt's fortunes again revived and the town has seen considerable expansion and is currently undergoing much speculative building.\n\nAndermatt has a population (as of ) of . , 10.0% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years the population has decreased at a rate of -8.8%. Most of the population () speaks German (95.2%), with Portuguese being second most common (1.0%) and Italian being third (0.9%). the gender distribution of the population was 50.8% male and 49.2% female.\n\nIn Andermatt about 75.2% of the population (between age 25-64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a \"Fachhochschule\").\n\nAndermatt has an unemployment rate of 0.9%. , there were 51 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 22 businesses involved in this sector. 90 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 13 businesses in this sector. 599 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 78 businesses in this sector.\n\nBetween 1961 and 1990 Andermatt had an average of 147.3 days of rain per year and on average received of precipitation.

The patriarchate also has three minor basilicas: the Basilica of Our Lady of the Martyrs and Basilica of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus in Estrela, both in Lisbon; the Basilica of Our Lady and St. Anthony in Mafra; and two World Heritage Site monasteries: the Monastery of the Hieronymites, in Lisbon, and the Monastery of Saint Mary of Alcobaça, in Alcobaça\n\nThe patriarchate pastorally served, as per 2014, 1,648,885 Catholics (86% of 1,924,650 total) on 3,735 km² in 285 parishes and 604 missions, with 543 priests (291 diocesan, 252 religious), 84 deacons, 1,505 lay religious (401 brothers, 1,104 sisters) and 54 seminarians.\n\nThe diocese of Lisbon was created in the 4th century, but it lay vacant after 716 when the city was captured by the Moors, notwithstanding that there are references to Mozarabic bishops of the Mozarabic Rite in that period. The diocese was restored when the city was captured by King Afonso I of Portugal during the Second Crusade in 1147 during the siege of Lisbon. A crusader's account of that event refers to the local \"elderly Bishop of the city\" being slain \"against all right and justice\", by marauding Flemish and German crusaders, in direct defiance of the terms of the city's rendition.\n\nAs Portugal grew in political importance and colonial possessions the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan of Lisbon expanded; Stadel says in his \"Compendium geographiae ecclesiasticae universalis\" (1712) that Coimbra, Leiria, Portalegre, Elvas, Funchal, Angra, Congo, St. James of Cape Verde, São Tomé, and Baia of All Saints were suffragans of Lisbon. As a reward for its assistance against the Turks, Pope Clement XI in 1708 raised the Chapel of the Royal Palace to Collegiate rank and associated with it three parishes in the dioceses of Bragança and Lamego. Later, yielding to the request of King John V, he issued the Bull \"In Supremo Apostolatus Solio\" (22 October 1716) – known as the Golden Bull because the seal or \"bulla\" was affixed with gold instead of lead – giving the collegiate chapel cathedral rank, with metropolitical rights, and conferring on its titular the rank of patriarch.\n\nThe city of Lisbon was ecclesiastically divided into Eastern and Western Lisbon. The former archbishop of Lisbon retained jurisdiction over Eastern Lisbon, and had as suffragan dioceses those of Guarda, Portalegre, St. James of Cape Verde, São Tomé, and São Salvador in Congo. Western Lisbon and metropolitan rights over Leiria, Lamego, Funchal and Angra, together with elaborate privileges and honours, were granted to the new patriarch and his successors. It was further agreed between pope and king that the patriarch of Lisbon should be made a cardinal at the first consistory following his appointment (\"Inter praecipuas apostolici ministerii\", 1737).\n\nThe first patriarch of Lisbon was Tomás de Almeida (1670–1754), formerly bishop of Porto; he was raised to the cardinalate on 20 December 1737 by Pope Clement XII. There thus existed side by side in the city of Lisbon two metropolitical churches. To obviate the inconvenience of this arrangement Pope Benedict XIV (13 December 1740) united East and West Lisbon into one single archdiocese under Patriarch Almeida, who ruled the see until his death in 1754. The double chapter however remained until 1843, when the old cathedral chapter was dissolved by Pope Gregory XVI. It was during the patriarchate of Cardinal Almeida (1746) that the famous Chapel of Saint John the Baptist was built in Rome (1742–1747) at the expense of King John V and consecrated by Pope Benedict XIV, and then transported to and reconstructed in the Church of St. Roch in Lisbon. Patriarch Almeida is buried in the chancel of that church.\n\nAt what date the patriarchs of Lisbon began to quarter the tiara with three crowns, though without the keys, on their coat of arms is uncertain and there are no documents referring to the grant of such a privilege. By apostolic letters dated 30 September 1881 the metropolitan of Lisbon claims as suffragans the dioceses of Angola, St. James of Cape Verde, São Tomé, Egitan, Portalegre, Angra, and Funchal.\n\nThroughout history, many privileges have been granted to the patriarchate of Lisbon and its patriarch by the Holy See.\n\n\nThese privileges were granted by Popes Clement XI, Innocent XIII, Benedict XIII and Clement XII. However, some have fallen into disuse over the centuries.\n\nLisbon, being one of the oldest cities in Iberia, has had a rich ecclesiastical history, in which the ordinaries of Lisbon have held different titles, partially depending on the country/city's rulers and their political/colonial power.\n\n\nAfter the Muslim invasion of Lisbon in 716, the see was vacant. The diocese was revitalized with the Siege of Lisbon in 1147, when the city was once again in Christian hands.\n\n\n\n\nThe suffragan sees of the Metropolitan are :\n\n\n"}

Its concept revolves around the history of airborne exploration.\n\nMusically, this album is somewhat different from \"Try Anything Once\" and the Alan Parsons Project albums, opting for more of a soft rock sound and a more stable band line-up rather than the funky rhythms, symphonic flares, or rotating vocalists of the past.\n\nThe album follows the history of airborne exploration, from the mythological flight of Daedalus and Icarus to escape the labyrinth of the Minotaur in \"Too Close to the Sun\", through Leonardo da Vinci's search to design a flying machine, or ornithopter, in long-time Project drummer Stuart Elliott's \"One Day To Fly\", until finally mankind's aspirations for space exploration placed on the shoulders of a single astronaut in \"So Far Away\" and the subsequent superpower race to put a man on the moon in \"Apollo\", a track backed by John F.

{"id": "1821909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821909", "title": "Integrity USA", "text": "Integrity USA\n\nIntegrity USA is a nonprofit organization that claims to work with the Episcopal Church in the United States (TEC) for the full inclusion of members and their allies. Integrity was founded by Louie Crew in rural Georgia, U.S., in 1974 and it had been a leading grassroots voice for the full inclusion of LGBT persons in The Episcopal Church and for equal access to its rites. \n\nFollowing a series of board resignations and controversy over allegations of mismanagement and lack of transparency, the organization and its future is a focus of scrutiny within the Christian press and members of the LGBT community. \n\nIn 1974, Louie Crew who was on a teaching fellowship in San Francisco telephoned the reportedly progressive Grace Cathedral in that city, asking if they could help him and his partner meet other gay Episcopalians. The derisive laughter he heard in response prompted him to start a newsletter that November to help gay and lesbian members of the church support one another in what was then a fairly hostile environment.\n\nA gifted writer, Dr. Crew penned the lead editorial himself:\n\n\"\"Integrity derives from integer, Latin for 'entire.' All Christian wholeness demands affirmation of God ordained sexuality; and gays and straights alike are Charged with the responsibility of using their sexuality in healthy human sharing rather than perversely trying to change or exchange the Gift of God.\" \"\n\nAcross the country, people saw the newsletter advertised in both church and gay publications. They organized into a handful of chapters and gathered, 200 strong, the following year for a national convention. The newsletter grew into a magazine, which was published until 2007, by which time the Internet was providing more immediate, interactive and cost-effective means of communication with Integrity's members.\n\nOften working in coalitions with both secular and other faith-based groups, Integrity has been instrumental in advancing the claim LGBT persons are making for equal protection and opportunity. Through its many ministries Integrity stood at the forefront of LGBT acceptance within The Episcopal Church and continued to work for progress towards full inclusion of its people.\n\nIntegrity has had official representation at every triennial General Convention of the Episcopal Church since 1977. The organization's members have helped draft and gather support for the legislative resolutions by which the church's official stance has evolved from denial to tolerance to welcome. The Integrity Eucharist at General Convention, once held on the margins, became an event that at its zenith drew nearly 2,000 worshipers. Some resolutions towards equality that Integrity had helped to achieve included: \n\nAt the 2012 General Convention of the Episcopal Church in Indianapolis, nearly every resolution which Integrity supported was affirmed by the church leadership:\n\nIntegrity USA was the fiscal sponsor of TransEpiscopal, an organization founded in 2004. TransEpiscopal is a group of transgender Episcopalians and their significant others, families, friends and allies dedicated to enriching their spiritual lives and to making the Episcopal Church a welcoming and empowering place that all truly can call their spiritual home. In 2012 the two groups collaborated on a video, Voices of Witness: Out of the Box, featuring transgender people of faith telling their own stories.\n\nSeveral Integrity chapters were joint chapters with Dignity, the pro-LGBT group working with Roman Catholics. Unlike Dignity in the Roman Catholic Church, Integrity does not act as an alternative to a parish (primarily because gay and lesbian Anglicans are not normally refused the Eucharist in parishes like their Roman Catholic counterparts). Most Integrity members are active in Episcopal parishes in addition to their Integrity activities.\n\nIntegrity USA has members in The Episcopal Church outside of the US, wherever TEC has congregations. Other organizations work in churches that are part of the Anglican Communion, but they are not part of Integrity USA's official structure and still function after the nationak body’s 2019 decline. Many of them are loosely affiliated with Integrity USA, as they share similar missions. For instance, LGBT members of the Anglican Church of Canada (ACC) have formed local Integrity groups, beginning with Integrity Toronto, which are loosely connected. There is no national Integrity organization in Canada. Integrity also has independent chapters in Australia.\n\nBetween March and June 2018, three Integrity USA board members resigned, leaving only one elected board member. \n\nBy Autumn 2019, Integrity USA was described by the Episcopal News Service as “a shadow of its former self, beset by struggles with leadership, finances, and communication.”\n\nIn 2019, Integrity USA’s board leadership had been described in the press as marked by \"instability and uncertainty\". In late November 2019, Integrity USA's president resigned, citing the need to spend more time with her family.\n\nIntegrity USA Founder Louie Crew Clay died two days later on November 27, 2019.\n\nAs further appointments to the organization's board were made in contravention of the Integrity USA's bylaws, the legitimacy of Integrity USA’s leadership and future elections have been placed in doubt by some remaining membership. \n\nIn 2020, multiple former presidents called for Integrity USA's dissolution. \n\n\n"}

They settled in Lincolnshire in the 14th century and became a prominent family there.\n\nSir Edmund Anderson, son of Edward Anderson, was born in Flixborough in Lincolnshire c. 1530. He received the first part of his education in the country and then spent a brief period at Lincoln College, Oxford, before entering the Inner Temple in June 1550. He is recorded to have matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge in 1549.\n\nIn 1577, Anderson was created Serjeant-at-Law and in 1578 he was appointed Queen's Sergeant. In 1581 he was appointed Justice of Assize on the Norfolk circuit and tried Edmund Campion and others for high treason in November 1581, securing an unexpected conviction. This set the pattern for the rest of his career: as a judge he was notorious for severity to Catholics and non-conformists, markedly so in the cases of John Perrot and John Udall, the puritan minister.\n\nOn the back of that success, Anderson was made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in 1582 and was knighted. He was reappointed by James I and held office until his death. Throughout his career he played a prominent role in some of the most important political trials of Elizabeth's reign including that of Mary, Queen of Scots, and Sir Walter Raleigh. Sir Edmund also presided over the trial of William Davison, the Queen's secretary who was accused of erroneously issuing the warrant for the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nIn 1588 he was sent to Ireland, where he headed a judicial commission to deal with the flood of litigation which followed the forfeiture of the lands of the Earl of Desmond. Its findings were something of a foregone conclusion, since the judges had instructions to find in favour of the English Crown in all disputed cases, and duly did so. This however was untypical, as in civil cases he usually went to great lengths to be impartial.\n\nAnderson died on 1 August 1605 at Eyeworth in Bedfordshire.\n\nAnderson was often described as a strict lawyer who was \"completely governed by the law\". He even stated at an important trial that, \"I sit here to judge of law, not logic\". Yet he also had a reputation for deciding cases according to reason, without over reliance on the precedents. He was highly praised for his efficient dispatch of business: it was said that he wrote more orders in a morning then most of his predecessors had in a week.\n\nIn \"Sir Edward Coke and the Elizabeth Age\" by Allen D. Boyer, Sir Edmund is described as \"the monster: an angry man in the courtroom and a resentful man afterward, an advocate who begrudged other lawyers' victories\". On the other hand, Francis Bacon praised him as a great judge.\n\nAnderson wrote two books, \"Reports of Many Principal Cases Argued and Adjudged in the Time of Queen Elizabeth, in the Common Bench 1644\" and \"Resolutions and Judgments on the Cases and Matters Agitated in All the Courts of Westminster, in the latter end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth 1653\", which are still today very influential legal references.\n\nAnderson married Magdalen Smyth from Annables, Hertfordshire, daughter of Christopher Smyth and Margaret Hyde. They had 9 children, 3 sons and 6 daughters. Anderson became lord of the parish of Eyeworth, Bedfordshire, and his family remained the local gentry for many generations. He also bought Arbury Priory, which he demolished and replaced with Arbury Hall.\n"}

Goetz was one of the founders of Twentieth Century Pictures, later renamed 20th Century Fox. He served as Fox's vice president and later became the head of production at Universal-International.\n\nBorn to a Jewish working-class family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Goetz was the youngest of eight children. His mother died when he was ten years old and shortly thereafter his father abandoned the family. Raised by older brothers, at the age of twenty-one he followed some of his brothers to Hollywood where he found work as a crew hand at one of the large studios. After a few years, he began doing production work and in 1930 was made an associate producer at Fox Films.\n\nIn 1932, Goetz received the financial support necessary from his new father-in-law, Louis B. Mayer, to become a minor partner with Joseph Schenck, the former president of United Artists, and Darryl F. Zanuck from Warner Bros. to create Twentieth Century Pictures. Zanuck was named president, and Goetz served as vice president. Successful from the very beginning, their 1934 film \"The House of Rothschild\" was nominated for Academy Award for Best Picture. In 1935, Twentieth Century bought the financially strapped Fox Films to create 20th Century Fox.\n\nGoetz served as vice president of 20th Century Fox, but in 1942, he took charge of the studio temporarily when Zanuck, a veteran of World War I, joined the United States military effort in World War II. Goetz liked the top role in the company, and after Zanuck returned, relationships became strained.\n\nIn 1943, Goetz resigned to form his own independent company with Leo Spitz, a former lawyer who worked as a movie company advisor. Their partnership, International Pictures, ended its short-lived existence when they made a deal in July 1946 to merge with the British Rank Organization's distribution arm and Universal Pictures. Goetz was made president and placed in charge of production for the newly merged Universal-International studio.\n\nAlthough one of the studio executives who formulated the 1947 Waldorf Statement, Goetz later softened his stand on the issue. In 1949, Goetz called upon his close friendship with MCA head Lew Wasserman, one of the more powerful agents in Hollywood. They revolutionized the motion picture industry when they agreed to a deal where James Stewart was signed to a profit participation deal to act in a Universal film. In lieu of a salary for his performance, Stewart was guaranteed half of the film's profits, and the concept was negotiated for other stars who recognized the value of their own box-office drawing power. Universal-International was acquired by Decca Records in late 1951, and Goetz was replaced by Edward Muhl in 1953. After leaving Universal, Goetz became an independent producer. He made 1957's \"Sayonara\", which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. He signed a six-picture deal with Columbia Pictures and produced \"Me and the Colonel\", \"They Came to Cordura\", \"The Mountain Road\", \"Song Without End\" and \"Cry for Happy\".\n\nIn March 1930, Goetz married Edith Mayer (1905–1988), daughter of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio head Louis B. Mayer – who at first was less than enthusiastic at the idea. The couple had two daughters, Judith and Barbara. Goetz and Mayer remained married until his death in 1969.\n\nGoetz's sister-in-law was theatrical producer Irene Mayer Selznick. Goetz's brother-in-law was film producer David O. Selznick to whom Irene was married from April 1930 to 1949.\n\nGoetz was a liberal Democrat and enthusiastically campaigned for Adlai Stevenson II in 1952 presidential election. Goetz angered his Republican Party father-in-law Louis B. Mayer when he announced plans to host a party for Stevenson at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Mayer was further angered when he learned that the party was to be co-hosted by film executive Dore Schary, the man with whom Mayer had worked with (and often fought with) at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and who replaced Mayer as the head of MGM in 1956. Although Mayer adored his daughter Edith, he had a difficult relationship with Goetz. This episode further strained their relationship, and Mayer never spoke to his son-in-law again.\n\nA very wealthy man, Goetz raised thoroughbred racehorses. His horse Your Host won the 1950 Santa Anita Derby and subsequently sired Kelso, a Hall of Fame inductee and one of the greatest horses in racing history.\n\nGoetz and his wife also were major investors in art, acquiring a significant collection of impressionist and post-impressionist works. They owned paintings and sculptures by artists such as Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne, Berthe Morisot, Édouard Manet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, Chaim Soutine, Pierre Bonnard, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, and Henri Fantin-Latour. In 1949, a controversy erupted over a Vincent van Gogh self-portrait titled \"Study by Candlelight\" that Goetz had purchased two years earlier. The painting was declared a fake by art expert Willem Sandberg and the artist's nephew, V.W. van Gogh, resulting in an international debate among art experts. The painting remained controversial and was not put up for auction with the rest of the Goetz collection following Edith Goetz's death in 1987. The painting was exhibited April 13–25, 2013 in the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno, Nevada.\n\nOn August 15, 1969, Goetz died of cancer at his Holmby Hills, Los Angeles home at the age of 66. He was buried in Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.\n"}

The landed gentry Lancelyn Green family can be traced back to 1093, with the marriage of Randle Greene (sic) and Elizabeth, daughter of William Lancelyn, taking place in the reign of Elizabeth I.\n\nHe studied under C.

His works of original fiction include \"The Luck of Troy\", set during the Trojan War, and \"The Land of the Lord High Tiger\", a fantasy that has been compared to the Narnia books.\n\nChronological order\n\n\nLancelyn Green wrote biographies of J. M. Barrie, Andrew Lang, and C. S. Lewis. His new edition of selected tales of Hans Christian Andersen contains a short biography. He also wrote a brief biography of Anthony Hope as the introduction to a one-volume Everyman's Library edition of \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" and its sequel \"Rupert of Hentzau\". He was editor of the \"Kipling Journal\", 1957–1979.\n\nLancelyn Green was particularly interested in Lewis Carroll, publishing several books and articles. His book \"The Story of Lewis Carroll\" (1949) led to an invitation from Carroll's nieces, Violet and Menella Dodgson, to produce an edited version of his diary; this appeared in 1953, and has been at the centre of the recent debate about the alleged 'Carroll Myth'. Karoline Leach devoted much space to considering it in her book \"In the Shadow of the Dreamchild\", claiming that something like 60% of the diary material was left out of this publication, and that Lancelyn Green's allegedly partial, inaccurate and misleading editing had contributed to a continued misrepresentation of Carroll in biographies and the media. At the time of publication, Lancelyn Green claimed to have seen all the diaries and certainly gave the impression he had been allowed unrestricted access, however Leach alleges he later retracted this claim and admitted he had been forced to work with heavily edited transcripts prepared for him by Menella Dodgson, 'for reasons of safety'. He was later a founder and vice-president of the Lewis Carroll Society and helped Morton N. Cohen to edit Carroll's collected letters.\n\nChronological order\n\n\nGreen was a part-time professional actor from 1942 to 1945, and a member of the Oxford literary group, the Inklings, along with C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. He was Deputy Librarian of Merton College, Oxford from 1945 to 1950 and William Nobel Research Fellow in English Literature at the University of Liverpool from 1950 to 1952. He was later a member of the Council of the University of Liverpool, from 1964 to 1971.\n\n"}

Following her hit version of \"Could It Be I'm Falling in Love\" with David Grant in 1985, Graham scored a further five UK Top 20 hits over a two-year period. In 1994, her cover version of Chaka Khan's hit \"Ain't Nobody\" reached number one on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Dance Chart.\n\nGraham was born in Birmingham to Jamaican immigrants. In 1983 after recording a session for a jazz funk band called ‘Medium Heat Wave’, Graham was spotted by a talent scout and signed to EMI Records. Soon after signing with the company \"What’s the Name of Your Game\" was released and this gave Graham her first TV appearance on the highly rated BBC children’s programme \"Crackerjack\" in 1984. Two further solo singles followed that year \"Heaven Knows\" (the title of her first album) and \"Once More with the Feeling\".\n\nThe duet with David Grant, a cover version of the Detroit Spinners track \"Could It be I’m Falling in Love\", was released in early 1985 reaching No. 5 in March of that year. Graham's fourth, and probably best known, solo single \"Round and Around\" saw her return to the UK top 10 a few months later. As her first album reached completion in the summer of that year, \"Heaven Knows\" was re-released and she toured the UK for the first time. A new song was recorded and released to end the year entitled \"Mated\". The song received wide critical acclaim gaining significant airplay.\n\nGraham's single \"Set Me Free\" was released in early 1986 and reached No. 7 in the UK, also seeing the success repeated throughout Europe. \"Breaking Away\" was released in August as the follow up single, reaching No. 14 in the UK charts. Graham's second album of the same name was also released. \"Breaking Away\" proved to be a surprise hit in Asia and to this date it remains one of Graham's most popular songs in this territory. Later in 1986 her hit \"Step Right Up\" was remixed and released also making the UK top 20.\n\nDuring this time, American singer Michael McDonald was looking for a female singer to accompany him on the track \"On My Own\" (originally recorded with Patti Labelle) for his next UK tour. After hearing Graham's voice, McDonald was quoted as saying \"Jaki is one of the best singers Britain has ever produced\", and a deep friendship and mutual respect grew between the two artists that remains to this day, with McDonald having written for Graham's albums and featuring her as a special guest on his UK tours.\n\nIn 1989 she released her third and final album recorded on the EMI label called \"From Now On\". This featured a more diverse sound than her two previous albums. The album includes two singles: the title track and ballad \"The Better Part of Me\", both of which failed to reach the UK top 40. Promotion for the album never truly got underway and Graham's time at EMI Records came to an end. As the 80’s drew to a close, \"Billboard\" magazine established Graham as Britain’s most successful black female artist throughout the decade.\n\nIn 1991, Graham joined with Paul Hardcastle in the group 'Kiss The Sky' - their self titled album was released that year.\nIn 1993, Graham was spotted by AVEX International, Japan, whilst at the Midem music conference and was immediately signed to the label. Work started in 1994 on her ‘Real Life’ album. Three singles were released internationally from the album, \"You Can Count On Me (For Love)\", \"Absolute E-Sensual\" and the song that would be Graham's biggest international single to date \"Ain't Nobody\".\n\n‘Ain't Nobody’ entered the charts in Europe, Asia, Australia and reached No.1 in the US Billboard Dance Chart for five weeks as well as being in the Top 5 favourite videos for BET (Black Entertainment Charts). The \"Real Life\" album was followed by a tour of Japan and Australia.\n\nIn 1995, Graham completed work on her second album for AVEX entitled \"Rhythm of Life\" which was again a chart success in chosen territories. In Sweden the album was released under the title \"Hold On\" and in the US \"Don’t Keep Me Waiting\", with both albums containing additional tracks exclusive to these releases. Graham's fourth and final album with AVEX was the R&B influenced \"My Life\" with one of the popular tracks being her version of Julia Fordham's \"Happy Ever After\".\n\nBetween March 2008 and April 2009, her early record label, EMI, re-released all three of Graham's albums digitally which included bonus tracks and 12” versions that were only previously available on vinyl 7” and 12” singles.\n\nIn October 2009, Graham performed at the Birmingham Town Hall with the BBC Big Band to perform specially arranged versions of Gershwin classics. Both the concert and the transmission that followed later on BBC Radio 2, received high critical acclaim and within a few weeks of the transmission Graham was invited back, this time to perform Duke Ellington classics in March 2010.\n\n2010 was a popular year for her music catalogue. In August, almost 24 years to the date of its original release, \"Breaking Away – Special Edition\" was put out on CD across the UK and Ireland via Cherry Pop. In addition to the 12 songs that were included in the original album, an additional five bonus tracks, three of which were exclusive to the CD, were added.\n\nDuring 2010, Graham accompanied Michael McDonald (singer) and Al Green on their UK ‘Legends’ Arena Tour which included Birmingham LG, Manchester MEN and London’s O2 Arena, as McDonald's special guest. Later in 2010, Demon Music released \"Absolute Essential – The Very Best of Jaki Graham\". This would be Graham's first ‘official’ ‘greatest hits’ album and included 28 songs over two CDs. The album included all of her singles from the 1980s, including for the first time \"Once More with the Feeling\", as well as 14 songs selected from Graham's time with AVEX.\n\nDuring 2011, Graham continued to perform worldwide at both public and corporate events. She also started to make plans and choose songs for what would become her seventh studio album, \"For Sentimental Reasons\". However, prior to the recording of the album, Graham was invited to join Sir Cliff Richard on his successful ‘Soulicious’ Arena Tour in October. This was his only British special guest alongside James Ingram, Percy Sledge, Freda Payne, Lamont Dozier and Marilyn McCoo & Billy Davis Jr of The 5th Dimension. The event was filmed across two nights at London’s O2 Arena and issued as a DVD.\n\nIn early 2012, she entered a small recording studio in Leeds, and along with her band, would record her new album. Graham returned to the recording studio in Leeds to add some additional backing vocals (along with half a day in the studio in Birmingham) and the album was complete. The mixing of the album took place in early August and was released in October 2012.\n\nGraham continued to perform worldwide and in late 2013 was approached to create a new show to perform on the cruise liner ‘Britannia’. The ship set sail from Southampton in March 2014 and she performed over 60 shows during that year at the ’Limelight’ venue on board.\n\nIn summer 2015, to coincide with the 30th Anniversary of the release of her debut album, \"Heaven Knows\", Demon Music released \"The Studio Albums: 1985-1998\" on its Edsel label. The 7CD, 86-track box set included the EMI albums \"Heaven Knows\", \"Breaking Away\" and \"From Now On\", as well as the four Avex albums; \"Real Life\", \"Hold On\", \"Rhythm of Life\" and \"My Life\"; the latter four receiving their first official UK release.\n\nIn 2016, Graham presented a radio programme, 'Soul on Sunday', on BBC Radio London. She continues to work as a singer on cruises worldwide, and has toured as part of the line-up for the retro/80's UK summer music festivals Let's Rock and Rewind.\n\nIn 2018, Graham released a new studio album, \"When A Woman Loves\", on her own label, JNT Music Ltd.\n\nIn early October 2012, Graham was honoured with a ‘Birmingham’s ‘Walk of Star’ on Broad Street. A show took place in the evening that month where she performed some of her hits, as well as a selection of songs from ‘For Sentimental Reasons’.\n\nIn 2015, Graham was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Wolverhampton in recognition of her services to the music industry.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1821950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821950", "title": "Elias Howe Company", "text": "Elias Howe Company\n\nThe Elias Howe Company was a 19th and early 20th century musical firm located in Boston, USA and founded by Elias Howe, Jr. (1820–1895). His company was successful, selling more than a million copies of his music instruction books by 1892. Howe was cousin to the inventor of the sewing machine and related to Julia Ward Howe, composer of The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\n\nHowe acquired a fiddle as a young boy and soon learned to play, working his way through tunes that he heard. He couldn't afford to buy the expensive sheet music of his day, but his ear was good enough for him to write down tunes that he heard other New England fiddlers play. He put together a book of tunes in this manner, while still young.\n\nHowe eventually acquired a substantial collection of these tunes and managed to get them published in book form in 1840 as \"The Musician's Companion\". He was unable to pay all at once for the 500 copies that printer Wright & Kidder agreed to print for him, but bought copies as he was able. The books were successful, and he sold enough of them, door-to-door and city-to-city, to open his own shop in 1842.\n\nBy 1850, Howe had published several other volumes of tune collections and musical instruction. In about that year, he sold his rights to those works to the Oliver Ditson Company of Boston and agreed to desist from publishing music for a period of 10 years, buying land in South Framingham and managing the South Reading Ice Company. He returned to publishing in about 1861 after the term of the agreement with Ditson had elapsed and became one of the country's most prolific musical publishers. By his own estimate, he compiled and published about 200 \"musical works\", under his own name, and using the pseudonyms \"Gumbo Chaff,\" \"Patrick O'Flanigan,\" and \"Mary O'Neill.\"\n\nSky notes that during the American Civil War, Howe expanded his activities to include manufacturing drums for Massachusetts regiments. He was offered the position of Director of Bands for the United States Army, and the rank of Lt. Colonel, by President Lincoln. He chose instead to continue manufacturing drums and fifes and publishing books on their use in marching bands.\n\nThe Elias Howe Company for many years was located at 88 Court Street in Boston and many of the volumes of sheet music and instrumental instruction that the company produced bear that address. Archival photos of the Scollay Square area of Boston dating from the 1880s often show the \"Howe's Music\" sign silhouetted against the sky above the buildings at the end of Court Street.\n\nAlthough company letterhead states that the firm was founded in 1840 (when Elias Howe, Jr. first published his fiddle tune collection), it was not formally incorporated until 1898, three years after the death of its founder. The principals at that time were Elias's sons Willam H. and Edward F. Howe, who served as president and treasurer, respectively. Their sister Harriet Howe was the company bookkeeper. The company expanded its operations considerably and became a full-service music store, offering several different types of musical instrument, parts for instruments, and, of course, an extensive catalog of musical publications. It has not been proven whether the company made their own instruments or contracted with local companies to build them. Whether they made the instruments or not, they did handle tonewood and were described as a large importer of the wood. \n\nThe company later relocated to 8 Bosworth Street in Boston, a few blocks from its earlier Court Street address. From the Bosworth Street location, the Elias Howe Company issued an extensively illustrated 97-page catalog.\nAlthough most of the goods for offer were related to violin-family instruments, the catalog also includes lines of guitars and mandolins. Of particular note are the Howe-Orme guitars and mandolins. These were highly innovative instruments that as early as 1897 incorporated novel features that eventually found their way into the designs of American instruments that followed. The mandolins featured an elaborate \"E H Co\" monogram inlaid in ivory-colored plastic into the instruments' tortoise pick guards. That logo may be among the most enduring visual reminders of the company. Ironically, it did not appear until two years after Elias Howe's death.\n\nThe Elias Howe Company closed its doors in the 1930s. Many of the music collections and instruments the company supplied to the nation remain in active use and are valued to this day.\n\nThe Howe-Orme name arises from the association of the younger Howes (William H. and Edward F. Howe) of Boston with George L. Orme of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. A May 1896 newspaper article announced a deal between \"Orme & Son\" and the \"Elias Howe Company\" for the United States manufacturing rights (on a royalty basis) for \"the celebrated \"Orme guitar and lute banjo.\"\n\nG. L. Orme was the younger partner in J. L. Orme & Son, a company founded by his father, James L. Orme. J. L. Orme & Son was a retailer of musical instruments, primarily pianos and organs, and a publisher of sheet music. They also had a musical instrument factory for their violins and guitars over their piano \"wareroom\". Like Elias Howe, Jr., J. L. Orme was deceased by the time that the Howe-Orme instruments appeared and his son, George, ran the company.\n\nGeorge Orme was an associate of James S. Back, with whom he shared patent rights to the musical instrument design that became the hallmark of Howe-Orme instruments. This design, first described in an 1893 patent (U. S. Patent No. 508858) awarded to Back with half-ownership assigned to Orme. The critical feature described in the patent is a \"raised longitudinal belly ridge\" extending along the top of the instrument, under the strings, from the end of the fingerboard to the tailpiece. The innovation is depicted on a guitar in the patent application but the patent text makes mention of its applicability to other stringed instruments. A subsequent design patent (U. S. Patent No. D27560) shows the concept applied to a guitar-shaped mandolin. That patent was awarded to Edward F. Howe on August 24, 1897.\n\nThe Howe-Orme instrument line comprises several models of guitar and an entire line of mandolin-family instruments including mandolin, tenor mandola, octave mandola, and mando-cello. Howe-Orme instruments were among the first to be produced in the United States in multiple sizes analogous to the members of the violin family. These mandolin-family instruments are unique not only because of the \"raised longitudinal belly ridge\" but because they are shaped like guitars and have absolutely flat backs. Although guitar-shaped mandolins were subsequently manufactured by other firms, an Elias Howe Company catalog from approximately 1910 notes that the Howe-Orme mandolins were the first such instruments. The catalog also points out the ease of holding a guitar-shaped instrument in contrast to the awkwardness of the bowl-back mandolins of that era.\n\nThe guitars had another unique feature in addition to the longitudinal ridge: their necks were easily detachable and their angle could be adjusted without any disassembly. The neck design, like the longitudinal ridge, originated with J. S. Back and is described most fully in U. S. Patent No. 538205, issued to Back, with half-ownership to G. L. Orme, in April, 1895.\n\nExamples of a guitar-shaped mandolin made solely by J. L. Orme company are very rare; after discovering one, a collector called his \"the missing link\" between the Canadian company and its patents and the variety of \"Howe-Orme\" instruments made by The Elias Howe Company. Although the J.L. Orme Company made the guitar-shaped mandolin in Canada, advertisements from the company focus on their guitars and their lute-banjos. The J. L. Orme & Son \"Lute-Banjo\" had a rounded, fat, oval body, with a neck held on by three screws (making the angle adjustable). \n\nThe (U.S. based) Elias Howe Company's \"Howe-Orme\" instruments had bodies shaped like guitars, with (at least for the mandolins) necks that were glued to the bodies with a dove-tail joint. \n\nThe patents covered a wide variety of instruments, being used to create guitars, mandolins and lute-banjos. What the two companies' instruments shared was the patented arched soundboard. Opinions by collectors have indicated that the Elias Howe instruments had a pressed soundboard, which kept its shape with internal braces. The Howe-Orme guitar also shared the adjustable neck system.\n\n\nAyars, C. M. (1937). \"Contribution to the art of music in America by the music industries of Boston 1640-1936\". New York: H. W.

Like many close and closed communities, the language used can often be full of jargon and not readily intelligible to outsiders—sometimes this is for military operational or security reasons; other times it is because of the natural evolution of the day-to-day language used in the various units.\n\nFor example: \"Captain, this situation is 'Scale A'\", \"Scale A\" being an army's parlance for \"This situation requires the closest of attention and resources and all members of relevance should be present.\"\n\nThe military has developed its own slang, partly as means of self-identification. This slang is also used to reinforce the (usually friendly) interservice rivalries. Some terms are derogatory to varying degrees and many service personnel take some pleasure in the sense of shared hardships which they endure and which is reflected in the slang terms.\n\nThe military often use initials and abbreviations of all kinds - partly for security and operational reasons and partly for the simple convenience of their use; like all such things they can be hard to understand for outsiders. A few examples are given below:\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Four Fs\" is a military term used in the United States military, especially during World War II.\n\nDesigned to be easy to remember, the \"Four Fs\" are as follows:\n\nThe British Army uses the mnemonic \"Perry Rat Likes Shooting Arseholes Regularly\" as a way of remembering its Six Section Battle Drills (Squad Tactics):\n\nAlternatively, the British Army uses the mnemonic P.R.E.W.A.R. to remember the 6 section battle drills. These are:\n\nThe seven Ps\n\nMany armed forces, particularly the US Army, use songs as part of the training process, to help build morale and allow troops to train to a unified rhythm. Historically armies also went into battle led by a military band and such bands are still maintained in the armed forces today - albeit for mainly ceremonial purposes.\n\nApart from the official side of music, fighting troops have always sung to keep up their morale and to ridicule the enemy, examples from the two world wars include:\n\n\nMilitary ranks are necessary to identify the role of each serving individual and to show the hierarchy of command; however they can be obscure to non-military personnel and even comparing comparative ranks between different services is not always straightforward; the following pages detail these matters in more detail:\n\n\nRank insignia is worn on military uniforms to identify the rank of the wearer and can involve such diverse elements as different uniforms, shoulder flashes, armbands and cap insignia.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 28, 1999. After causing damage at the Smithsonian expedition, Homer is forced to allow a cell phone company to build a mast in the Simpson's house. With it taking up Lisa's room. Lisa is forced to share with Bart, but the stress of living in the same room as Bart gives her stomach aches. Homer and Lisa decide to visit a New Age store, where the owner convinces them to go on a spiritual journey by lying in a sensory deprivation tank for a prolonged amount of time.\n\n\"Make Room for Lisa\" was written by Brian Scully and was the first full \"The Simpsons\" episode Matthew Nastuk directed, having received a co-director credit for \"D'oh-in' in the Wind\", for which he directed one scene. The episode's subplot, which revolves around Marge listening in on phone calls using a baby monitor, was inspired by former showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, who also listened to private phone calls with a monitor. The episode contains references to the American sitcom \"All in the Family\", and advises children to be accepting of their parents. \n\nIn its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 7.6 million viewers, finishing in 52nd place in the ratings the week it aired. \n\nFollowing the home video release of \"The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season\", \"Make Room for Lisa\" received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nHomer participates in a KBBL-sponsored drinking contest at P.J. O'Harrigan's, an Irish pub, and wins the trophy and title of \"Sir Drinks-A-Lot\". Once sober, Marge reminds Homer of his promise to spend one Saturday a month with the children. Much to Homer's chagrin, Bart traded his turn to choose with Lisa for her dessert, and Lisa suggests that the family go to the traveling Smithsonian Institution exhibit. Homer attempts to punish Bart by forbidding him to have any dessert, but this backfires when Bart gives his turn to Lisa in exchange for her dessert again, much to Homer's discomfort. They arrive at the exhibit, which is sponsored by a cell phone company called OmniTouch, has Abraham Lincoln's hat, Fonzie's jacket, Archie Bunker's chair, and the Bill of Rights, which is ruined when Homer reads it with chocolate-covered hands. In an attempt to lick it clean he licks off the section that forbids cruel and unusual punishment. Homer is unable to pay the $10,000 repair bill and so Omnitouch installs a cellular transmitter on the roof of his house to help him pay the bill, with the control equipment in Lisa's room. Lisa moves in with Bart, but she is overwhelmed when Bart has made up rules and noises distract her from her homework. She is further stressed when Homer has her watch TV with him instead of letting her focus on her homework.\n\nWhen Lisa develops stomach aches, she visits Dr. Hibbert, who suggests he could prescribe 'harsh Antacids' but says herbal tea could also work. Lisa wants the tea but Homer, scoffs at the tea and demands the antacids. While leaving the office Lisa has had enough and snaps at her father for belittling everything she believes in. When Lisa sees how she upset him, she says that they are just too different and will eventually drift apart. To make things up to her, Homer takes her to a local New Age store that introduces Homer and Lisa to water-filled sensory deprivation tanks, where they experience their own spiritual journey. On her journey, Lisa sees herself from the perspective of various figures in her life. She eventually sees herself from Homer's perspective, reprimanding him for snoring during a ballet recital. Lisa realizes that despite his boorish personality, Homer loves Lisa enough to take her to events and places that he does not personally like just so she can be happy. Meanwhile, a pair of repo men start to clean out the store despite the lease not being up for months, taking the tank that Homer is in. Homer's \"journey\" becomes a real one, as his tank falls out of the back of the van. Mistaken by the Flanders' as a coffin, they bury him, only for the tank to fall through the soil and into a pipe where it is washed up onto the beach. Chief Wiggum finds it and returns it to the store. When Homer and Lisa both leave their tanks, Lisa decides to go and do something they both enjoy - a demolition derby, even though Homer is the only fan.\n\nMeanwhile, Maggie's baby monitor receives transmissions from the cellular tower. Rather than report this to Omnitouch, Marge becomes obsessed with eavesdropping on private calls. Eventually Bart and Milhouse play a prank on Marge by making her think that an escaped convict was attempting to break into the house. When Milhouse opens the front door and tries to tell Marge that it was just a prank, Marge smashes the baby monitor on Milhouse's head and knocks him out and Bart rebukes that it was a fair punishment for eavesdropping, to which Marge reluctantly agrees she has learned her lesson, though asks Bart to take the blame for hitting Milhouse if anyone asks.\n\n\"Make Room for Lisa\" was written by Brian Scully and was the first full episode Matthew Nastuk directed for \"The Simpsons\". Nastuk had previously received a credit for \"D'oh-in' in the Wind\", which he directed one scene for. \"Make Room for Lisa\" was also the second episode about Homer and Lisa that Scully wrote for the series, the first one being \"Lost Our Lisa\" from the previous season. \"Make Room for Lisa\" was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February 28, 1999. When writing the episode, the \"Simpsons\" writing staff debated what to do with Lisa after her room had been rebuilt. Brian Scully eventually pitched that Lisa and Bart would have to share a room together, as it would, according to staff writer Matt Selman, comment on the feeling of having to share a room with a sibling, and how it would \"incredibly suck.\" The writers then wrote the episode around that plot point.\n\nNear the beginning of the episode, Homer takes part in, and wins, KBBL's drinking contest. In the next scene, Homer is seen fallen out of his car, and waken up by Marge. The scene was inspired by Scully's brother Mike Scully, who, during a date, saw his date's father \"drunk and passed out\" on her lawn, in the same pose as Homer in the scene. The episode's subplot revolves around Marge, who listens to phone calls by picking up their frequencies with a baby monitor. The storyline was based on former \"Simpsons\" showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, who also used to listen to other people's phone calls through airwave signals. At one point in the episode, Marge overhears a conversation between Moe Szyslak and Lenny Leonard. Originally, the conversation would be between two women, but the writers thought it would be \"too cliche\" to show women gossiping, and changed it to Moe and Lenny instead. While inside the isolation tank, Homer gets bored and starts singing \"Witch Doctor\" by Armenian-American singer Ross Bagdasarian Sr. aka David Seville. According to Mike Scully, the \"Simpsons\" staff had to pay the song's record company $100 000 for the rights to use the tune in the episode. The episode features a \"prototype\" of what would become the recurring character Lindsey Naegle, who is voiced by American actress Tress MacNeille.\n\nThroughout the series, Homer and Lisa's relationship is problematic, as Homer often struggles to understand Lisa, who in many ways is a little girl but who is also smarter than him. Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay analyzed \"Make Room for Lisa\" in their book \"The Simpsons in the classroom: Embiggening the Learning Experience with the Wisdom of Springfield\". They wrote that in the episode, Homer and Lisa's relationship is badly damaged after Homer allows Lisa's room to be turned into a cell phone tower. When the two enter sensory-deprivation tanks, Lisa has several hallucinations, including one in which she becomes Homer. This experience shows Lisa how she appears from Homer's point of view, and makes her realize that her treatment of Homer is hurtful, as he often participates in activities with her that he does not enjoy. The episode ends with Homer and Lisa watching a demolition derby, which Lisa enjoys because she is spending time with Homer. The episode advises children to be accepting of their parents, who \"do the best [they] can\" to raise them.\n\nThe American sitcom \"All in the Family\" has provided much influence for the comedy in \"The Simpsons\", as John Alberti writes in his book \"Leaving Springfield: the Simpsons and the possibility of oppositional culture\". He wrote that the series influence on \"The Simpsons\" is \"acknowledged quite openly in the program itself,\" and used a scene in \"Make Room for Lisa\" as an example. The scene shows Homer, Bart and Lisa visiting the Smithsonian Exhibition, where a jacket worn by Fonzie, a character from another 70's series, \"Happy Days\", receives more attention from visitors than the Bill of Rights. It does however catch the attention of Homer, who picks it up and reads it while sitting in a wing chair owned by Archie Bunker, a character from \"All in the Family\". Homer is accosted by two security guards, who assault him using, according to Alberti, \"the kind of language we have learned to accept from the erstwhile occupant of that chair [Bunker].\" Homer and the two guards have the following exchange:\n\nAlberti opines that, rather than denying \"All in the Family\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s influence on \"The Simpsons\", the series writers \"mockingly embrace it\" by having Homer visually likened to Bunker as he sits on his chair. Alberti also noted that one of the security officer's use of the word \"pinko\", a term used for a person who is regarded as sympathetic towards communism, is \"ironic\" as it was used by Bunker, whose chair Homer is sitting in. When the other officer complains about citizens \"hiding behind the Bill of Rights\", Homer shields himself from the officers blows with the actual manuscript, making the officer's previous statement literal.\n\nAt the beginning of the episode, when Homer overhears a radio broadcast explaining the year being 1939 and comes to the mistaken assumption that he somehow traveled back in time, the song playing on the radio was Sing, Sing, Sing by Benny Goodman.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on February 28, 1999, \"Make Room for Lisa\" received a 7.6 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 7.6 million viewers. The episode finished in 52nd place in the ratings for the week of February 22–28, 1999, tied with a new episode of the CBS documentary and news program \"48 Hours\". On August 7, 2007, the episode was released as part of \"The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD box set. Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Ron Hauge, Matt Selman and Mike B. Anderson participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode.\n\nFollowing its home video release, \"Make Room for Lisa\" received mixed reviews from critics. \n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\" described the episode as having \"two distinct halves, although the second far outweighs the first.\" They added that Homer's adventure in the sensory deprivation tank was \"inspired,\" in its \"almost Keystone Kop humour as he gets from point A to point B and so on, finally getting back to point A none the wiser.\" They concluded their review by calling the episode \"classic.\" \n\nColin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a mixed review, and described its main plot as \"feeling a bit stale.\" He felt that there were already several episodes dedicated to Homer and Lisa's problematic relationship, and that \"Make Room for Lisa\" \"doesn't do much to expand that theme.\" However, he described the episode's subplot as \"interesting,\" and wrote \"Marge's fascination with intercepted cell phone calls amuses.\" He concluded his review by describing the episode as \"pretty average.\" \n\nDVD Town's James Plath gave the episode a mixed review as well, calling it \"okay.\"\n\n"}

In 1823 he became a member of the Académie Nationale de Médecine. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849.\n\nAndral is remembered for his pioneer investigations of blood chemistry.

{"id": "1821966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821966", "title": "Firth Park (ward)", "text": "Firth Park (ward)\n\nFirth Park ward—which includes the districts of Firth Park, Longley, Parson Cross and parts of Wincobank—is one of the 28 electoral wards in City of Sheffield, England located in the northern part of the city and covering an area of . The population of this ward in 2011 was 21,141 people in 8,602 households.\n\nFirth Park is one of the four-and-a-half wards that make up the current Sheffield Hillsborough and Brightside Parliamentary constituency.\n\nFirth Park () is a district of Sheffield surrounding the local park, also named Firth Park, given to the city by Mark Firth in 1875 and was opened by the Prince of Wales, HRH Prince Albert Edward, later Edward VII. Mark Firth was the pioneer of a number of Sheffield Steelworks including the well-known company of the era 'Firth Brown'. He was reported as to wanting to create an environment with quality housing, leisure and greenery for his workers and their families. The concept has been likened to that of the Bournville project near Birmingham.\n\nLocated just from Meadowhall Shopping Centre and the M1 junction 34, and from the city centre, the area runs from Addison Road in the south of postal district S5 to the top of Bellhouse Road bordering Sheffield Lane Top and Shiregreen. The main through routes are the B6086 and A6135.\n\nFirth Park includes the protected ancient woodland known as Hinde Common Wood, plus a substantial area of parkland along with mostly large Victorian style terraced houses which were built around 1910. Well known landmarks include the clock tower community centre and old library on Firth Park Road, both listed buildings from the early 1900s.\n\nThe area benefits from being on a major cross city public transport route for the city of Sheffield and has a shopping centre with over 40 independent shops as well as High Street banks and building societies, national supermarket chains, well-known chemists and a variety of healthcare practitioners.\n\nIn the centre of the Firth Park area is the park of the same name, which was refurbished between 1998 and 2004 with a major community centre added in the place of the old park keepers house, new trees planted and a refurbished central roundabout themed on the old tram turnaround point from the 1950s.\n\nIn January 2010, the Firth Park regeneration masterplan has been announced to include the utilisation of the natural water stream which runs through Hinde Common Wood. The plans are to bring the stream to the surface within the park itself on Firth Park Road, through the centre of the parkland then under the road to rejoin the woodland via the old boating lake/duckpond next to the historic clock tower.\n\nThe scheme is to include new architecture, lighting and seating. It is aimed that the scheme will complete around 2012 and add further trees to the already attractive and popular woodland area.\n\nSignificant city council regeneration of private properties in the south of the area in 2005 has helped both the quality of housing and the respective house prices. The area is now one of the more popular residential districts on the North side of the city.\n\nFirth Park district has also been at the forefront of domestic technology for a number of decades. The early 1960s saw the first UK cable TV trial known as 'British Relay' installed across the area and then the city of Sheffield. Yorkshire Cable (Virgin Media) installed cable TV and telephone as early as 1994. British Telecom also provide high speed broadband to the district from their nearby exchange. All major mobile phone operators are served by a transmitter at the centre of the village.\n\nThe Firth Park Grammar School was also a well-known landmark and stood for over 100 years at the north of the area with a well-deserved reputation for quality schooling. It was demolished and replaced by a new community college in 2003 which offers a diverse range of subjects.\n\nThe Northern General Hospital (formerly the City General), which lies on the edge of the ward, is the largest teaching hospital in the county, spreading from Barnsley Road on the west of the village across to Herries Road on a large site, and has a number of specialist units of national repute. Off Barnsley Road at the bottom of Idsworth Road stands one of Sheffield's oldest working mans club, The Firth Park Working Man's Club.\n\nImmediately north of Firth Park is Shiregreen, the first and largest council housing estate in the UK.\n\nLongley is a district of the city made up of mainly local authority built houses and is located between the districts of Firth Park and Sheffield Lane Top in the North of the City.\n\nLongley Park is a substantial area of parkland and adds to beautiful views over part of the city. In the 1960s the park was home to “Longley Baths”, Sheffield’s most popular lido. On warm summer days, especially during the school annual holidays, it was a leisure point for many of North Sheffield’s teenage population.\nLocal business includes the head office of the National Blood transfusion service.\n\nParson Cross () is a Council housing estate situated north of Sheffield City Centre. Most of the housing was built pre-war in 1938 (referred to as \"Old Parson Cross\" or simply \"Sheffield 5\") and post-war in 1947 (referred to as \"New Parson Cross\" or \"The Colley Estate\" ), although there was significant continuation during the war, using Italian PoWs who were billeted at Potter Hill Camp, High Green, and Lodge Moor Camp.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, Sheffield Council, and the neighbouring Wortley Rural District Council agreed to develop a large area of farmland for domestic habitation. The green belt was bordered to the south by Hillsborough and Wadsley Bridge and to the north by Grenoside and Ecclesfield. The Sheffield-West Riding demarcation line ran through the centre; consequently, there was a small but vociferous opposition from some members of the Wortley Rural District Council, who saw it as an inevitable “swallowing up” of their historical villages by an ever-expanding industrial city. For Sheffield, however, it was essential that they find room for some 30,000 new homes as they continued production of a large proportion of the world's stainless steel. A power sharing agreement ensured that one third of these new homes would be built here, Parson Cross. (One anomaly of this power sharing was that kids in the same class at school, who lived at different ends of the same street, could well be administered by differing education authorities.) According to a 1901 map, a circle based around Parson Cross Road and Parson Cross School, was then a small estate known as Parson Cross. The name originates from a large marker cross based at \"The Grange\" (now Wadsley Bridge WMC) which was visible from miles around, and signified the pathway to the Parsonage at Ecclesfield Church. The base to this cross was unearthed in circa 1908, on the site of The Grange's new vinery, and scattered into pieces. A second marker cross was situated at Creswick Greave. The only recognisable Parson Cross street in existence in 1901 was Doe Royd Lane.\n\nTowards the end of the Second World War, and immediately afterwards, Henry Boot Construction were tasked with building the new estate. German PoWs, who were encamped at the site which would become \"Parson Cross Filling Station\", were a key part of the building team, and left their mark in fresh concrete at a number of sites, notably at the Westernmost junction of Wordsworth Avenue and Margetson Crescent. During the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s, families were moved onto Parson Cross from industrialized areas of Sheffield such as Attercliffe and Heeley, where Victorian and Georgian cramped social housing units were being demolished, or turned from multi-occupancy to single-occupancy buildings. The estate now bordered the other Sheffield estates of Shiregreen, Ecclesfield, Longley, Southey, Owlerton, Wadsley Bridge, and Foxhill.\n\nThe two main roads (no new thoroughfare was called “Street”) were Wordsworth Avenue, which runs the entire length from south to north, and Deerlands Avenue, running east to west. The point at which the two avenues cross is generally seen as the epicentre of (nickname) “The Cross” and is home to The Parson Cross Hotel and, for many years, was the 53 bus terminus. In 2011 a large Asda Supermarket opened at this juncture, on Chaucer School's former playing fields. Still the epicentre, it's now universally known as \"The Asda Roundabout\"\n\nThe other thoroughfares (Chaucer Road, Yew Lane, Southey Green Road, Buchanan Road, Lindsay Avenue and Colley Road) cross the estate. The A61 (Halifax Road) runs to the west and the A6135 (Barnsley Road) runs to the east of the estate. Other popular public houses are The Wordsworth Tavern on Wordsworth Avenue and “The Beagle” on Knutton Crescent. There is also a large working men's club, Colley WMC, next to Margetson Shops. Schools include Meynell, Mansel, Monteney, Parson Cross and St Thomas More's Primary Schools with Yewlands and Chaucer Secondary Schools. Shopping centres are located on Margetson Crescent, Wordsworth Drive, Buchanan Road, Lindsay Avenue, Wheata Road and Chaucer Road. Playing fields are situated at Colley Recreation Ground and Parson Cross Park. A new library was built on Wordsworth Avenue, opposite the Asda in 2011. The church for the post-war New Parson Cross area is St Paul's on Wordsworth Avenue. The only significant waterway in Parson Cross is the \"Tongue Gutter\", a small brook which runs parallel with Deerlands Avenue for the entire width of the estate and which fed Ecclesfield Well from the 16th century onwards. In 1960, Parson Cross contained 10,000 houses, which were home to a total of 50,000 people, one-tenth of Sheffield's entire population, and together with the Shiregreen estate formed \"Sheffield 5\", Europe’s largest social housing conurbation.\n\nFor the first families moving on to Parson Cross, it was a working-class paradise. Most had experienced only multi-occupancy terraced dwellings, and the chance to have one's own house, with indoor bathroom and toilet and front and back gardens was something previously unimaginable, especially after the dark years of World War II and the extra industrial responsibility this laid on the shoulders of the local industries. Those who did not go to war had worked long hard hours in cramped and often dangerous conditions, providing the backbone to the war effort. Welders, platers and grinders provided munitions of all shapes and sizes, and many female steelworkers, filled the gaps the men had left. Even the heavy industry of the rolling mills and forges continued.\n\nAfter the war, the wives of Parson Cross turned their hands to the bakeries (Fletchers and Sunblest) and confectionery (Bachelors and Bassetts). Many continued working in the steel industry, although most of the skilled work went back to the men, and the women picked up the more routine roles.\n\nMany of the children born in the immediate post-war years, were the first phase of Baby Boomers. For these families Parson cross was an idyll. First-class social housing, blending into a lush green belt.\n\nIn September 1955, the Parish Council expressed interest in acquiring certain sites for “allotment purposes”. The estate is referred to as “Ecclesfield Parson Cross” by the architect.\n\nSite A Mansell Rd West Side of street, in centre.\n\nSite B Knutton Crescent, north side of eightfoot walking towards Chaucer Rd\n\nSite C Knutton Rd behind Margetson Shops (now SOAR Works)\n\nSite D Adlington Rd, North of Deerlands Ave junction.\n\nSite E, Holgate Crescent, North of Deerlands Ave junction.\n\nSite F, Rokeby Rd, Just east of junction with Turie Avenue.\n\nSite G, Colley Crescent, NE of Rokeby Drive junction\n\nSite H, Monteney Rd, South side of street at Wordsworth Avenue end.\n\nSite J, North side of street at Morrall Rd end\n\nIn the following exchange of letters, it was suggested that, rather than allotment sites, they should be used for the construction of garages.\n\nSite B was suggested as a children’s playground site.\n\nSheffield Corporation asked if they could acquire Site C for a “Public Works Depot” (in the 1960s, this was indeed the local PWD site) and Site G for a “Sunday School” Site C is now home to SOAR Works, an Enterprise Centre providing office, artist and workshop space to local businesses and individuals.\n\nThe local cinema was The Ritz. Situated at the junction of Wordsworth Avenue and Southey Green Road, it opened in 1939 and closed as a cinema in 1966, although it continued as a bingo hall until 2001. The final film was shown on Wednesday 9 November 1966 – Kim Novak & Richard Johnson in “The Amorous Adventures Of Moll Flanders”. During the early years of the new millennium, the building was allowed to fall into ruin and became the victim of graffiti artists and arsonists alike. In the closing weeks of 2012, the bulldozers moved in and began dismantling this former \"Palace of Laughter\", completing the task in early 2013.\n\nParson Cross’s most famous son is The Right Honourable David Blunkett (born 6 June 1947), who, despite being born totally blind, carved out a successful political career, rising to the post of Education Secretary and eventually Home Secretary. He announced that he would be retiring as an MP at the 2015 election.\nOlympic silver medallist Sheila Sherwood (Long Jump, Mexico 1968) is also a native of the estate. As Sheila Parkin, she attended local secondary modern school “Yew Lane”, later renamed \"Yewlands\", where, at the age of fifteen, she was appointed as Head-Girl. After a successful set of O-Level results, she transferred to a grammar school in nearby Ecclesfield to study for her A-Levels.\n\nValerie Georgina Howarth, Baroness Howarth of Breckland, OBE (born 5 September 1940) was born and grew up on Buchanan Rd, and took the title of \"Baroness of Parson Cross in the County of South Yorkshire\" when she was made a life peer in 2001. She attended Southey School until the age of 11 when she transferred to the Girls High School at Abbeydale Grange. She was Head of Social Services for Brent Council and later worked alongside Esther Rantzen as Director of Childline\n\nIn the late 1990s, the housing Authorities instigated a program of housing reduction. Many of the two-bedroom houses, especially those on and around Buchanan Road, were demolished, and the land they occupied left to grow wild. In 2012 some of these sites were developed as new housing facilities.\n\nThis was followed by the demolition of the Malthouses (houses built by World War II Italian POWs constructed from reinforced concrete sections) on Mansel Crescent, Mansel Avenue and Wordsworth Avenue.\n\nThe long-term effect of this program, still underway in 2009, is to create a less crowded, greener environment for future generations.\n\nIn June 2008, Radio Sheffield broadcast a play about the impact of this regeneration. Entitled The View, it featured four fictional characters and was used as a catalyst for an invited audience of Parson Cross residents to comment on the plans and to talk about the issues raised.\n\nIt was written by Ashley Barnes, the artistic director of the Dead Earnest theatre company. Much of the content was inspired by the writings of present and former residents on the Parson Cross section of the Sheffield Forum, a website for all things Sheffield.\n\nIn 2010 a book about growing up in Parson Cross in the fifties, “Get Thi Neck Weshed” by Graham Shepherd, was published by ACMRetro, specialists in Sheffield’s post war social history.\nThis was followed in 2011 by “Gee’or Ruwerin” by Steve Bush, a similar account but based this time centred around a 1960s childhood.\nBoth books are unashamedly written in the Parson Cross vernacular and contain a wealth of local idioms.\n\nOrigin of the word “Eightfoot”\n\nA letter from the Parish Clerk to County Hall in Wakefield, January 1954, refers to the pathways between houses on Parson Cross, Wordsworth Avenue, Colley Avenue and Rokeby Rd, as “Eight-foot Pathways”. This was the name given to these walkways by the site architects. The paths are still known as “Eightfoots” by local residents. In 2017 a bistro pub called \"The Eightfoot-Way\" opened on the site of Chaucer School's Netball Court.\n\n"}

{"id": "1821971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821971", "title": "Mid-ocean ridge", "text": "Mid-ocean ridge\n\nA mid-ocean ridge (MOR) is a seafloor mountain system formed by plate tectonics. It typically has a depth of ~ and rises about two kilometers above the deepest portion of an ocean basin. This feature is where seafloor spreading takes place along a divergent plate boundary. The rate of seafloor spreading determines the morphology of the crest of the mid-ocean ridge and its width in an ocean basin. The production of new seafloor and oceanic lithosphere results from mantle upwelling in response to plate separation. The melt rises as magma at the linear weakness between the separating plates, and emerges as lava, creating new oceanic crust and lithosphere upon cooling. The first discovered mid-ocean ridge was the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is a spreading center that bisects the North and South Atlantic basins; hence the origin of the name 'mid-ocean ridge'. Most oceanic spreading centers are not in the middle of their hosting ocean basis but regardless, are traditionally called mid-ocean ridges. Mid-ocean ridges around the globe are linked by plate tectonic boundaries and the trace of the ridges across the ocean floor appears similar to the seam of a baseball. The mid-ocean ridge system thus is the longest mountain range on Earth, reaching about .\n\nThe mid-ocean ridges of the world are connected and form \"the\" Ocean Ridge, a single global mid-oceanic ridge system that is part of every ocean, making it the longest mountain range in the world. The continuous mountain range is long (several times longer than the Andes, the longest continental mountain range), and the total length of the oceanic ridge system is long.\n\nAt the spreading center on a mid-ocean ridge the depth of the seafloor is approximately . On the ridge flanks the depth of the seafloor (or the height of a location on a mid-ocean ridge above a base-level) is correlated with its age (age of the lithosphere where depth is measured). The depth-age relation can be modeled by the cooling of a lithosphere plate or A good approximation is that the depth of the seafloor at a location on a spreading mid-ocean ridge proportional to the square root of the age of the seafloor. The overall shape of ridges results from Pratt isostacy: close to the ridge axis there is hot, low-density mantle supporting the oceanic crust. As the oceanic plate cools, away from the ridge axis, the oceanic mantle lithosphere (the colder, denser part of the mantle that, together with the crust, comprises the oceanic plates) thickens and the density increases. Thus older seafloor is underlain by denser material and is deeper.\n\n\"Spreading rate\" is the rate at which an ocean basin widens due to seafloor spreading. Rates can be computed by mapping of marine magnetic anomalies that span mid-ocean ridges. As crystallized basalt extruded at a ridge axis cools below Curie points of appropriate iron-titanium oxides, magnetic field directions parallel to the Earth's magnetic field are recorded in those oxides. The orientations of the field preserved in the oceanic crust comprise a record of directions of the Earth's magnetic field with time. Because the field has reversed directions at known intervals throughout its history, the pattern of geomagnetic reversals in the ocean crust can be used as an indicator of age; given the crustal age and distance from the ridge axis, spreading rates can be calculated.\n\nSpreading rates range from approximately 10–200 mm/yr. Slow-spreading ridges such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge have spread much less far (showing a steeper profile) than faster ridges such as the East Pacific Rise (gentle profile) for the same amount of time and cooling and consequent bathymetric deepening. Slow-spreading ridges (less than 40 mm/yr) generally have large rift valleys, sometimes as wide as 10–20 km (6.2–12.4 mi), and very rugged terrain at the ridge crest that can have relief of up to a . By contrast, fast-spreading ridges (greater than 90 mm/yr) such as the East Pacific Rise lack rift valleys. The spreading rate of the North Atlantic Ocean is ~ 25 mm/yr, while in the Pacific region, it is 80–145 mm/yr. The highest known rate is over 200 mm/yr in the Miocene on the East Pacific Rise. Ridges that spread at rates <20 mm/yr are referred to as ultraslow spreading ridges (e.g., the Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean and the Southwest Indian Ridge).\n\nThe spreading center or axis, commonly connects to a transform fault oriented at right angles to the axis. The flanks of mid-ocean ridges are in many places marked by the inactive scars of transform faults called fracture zones. At faster spreading rates the axes often display overlapping spreading centers that lack connecting transform faults. The depth of the axis changes in a systematic way with shallower depths between offsets such as transform faults and overlapping spreading centers dividing the axis into segments. One hypothesis for different along-axis depths is variations in magma supply to the spreading center. Ultra-slow spreading ridges form both magmatic and amagmatic (currently lack volcanic activity) ridge segments without transform faults.\n\nMid-ocean ridges exhibit active volcanism and seismicity. The oceanic crust is in a constant state of 'renewal' at the mid-ocean ridges by the processes of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics. New magma steadily emerges onto the ocean floor and intrudes into the existing ocean crust at and near rifts along the ridge axes. The rocks making up the crust below the seafloor are youngest along the axis of the ridge and age with increasing distance from that axis. New magma of basalt composition emerges at and near the axis because of decompression melting in the underlying Earth's mantle. The isentropic upwelling solid mantle material exceeds the solidus temperature and melts. The crystallized magma forms new crust of basalt known as MORB for mid-ocean ridge basalt, and gabbro below it in the lower oceanic crust. Mid-ocean ridge basalt is a tholeiitic basalt and is low in incompatible elements. Hydrothermal vents fueled by magmatic and volcanic heat are a common feature at oceanic spreading centers.\n\nMost crust in the ocean basins is less than 200 million years old, which is much younger than the 4.54 billion year age of the Earth. This fact reflects the process of lithosphere recycling into the Earth's mantle during subduction. As the oceanic crust and lithosphere moves away from the ridge axis, the peridotite in the underlying mantle lithosphere cools and becomes more rigid. The crust and the relatively rigid peridotite below it make up the oceanic lithosphere, which sits above the less rigid and viscous asthenosphere.\n\nOceanic lithosphere is formed at an oceanic ridge, while the lithosphere is subducted back into the asthenosphere at ocean trenches. Two processes, ridge-push and slab pull, are thought to be responsible for spreading at mid-ocean ridges. Ridge push refers to the gravitation sliding of the ocean plate that is raised above the hotter asthenosphere, thus creating a body force causing sliding of the plate downslope. In slab pull the weight of a tectonic plate being subducted (pulled) below an overlying plate at a subduction zone drags the rest of the plate along behind it. The slab pull mechanism is considered to be contributing more than the ridge push.\n\nA process previously proposed to contribute to plate motion and the formation of new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges is the \"mantle conveyor\" due to deep convection (see image). However, some studies have shown that the upper mantle (asthenosphere) is too plastic (flexible) to generate enough friction to pull the tectonic plate along. Moreover, mantle upwelling that causes magma to form beneath the ocean ridges appears to involve only its upper 400 km (250 mi), as deduced from seismic tomography and from observations of the seismic discontinuity in the upper mantle at about 400 km (250 mi). On the other hand, some of the world's largest tectonic plates such as the North American Plate and South American plate are in motion, yet only are being subducted in restricted locations such as the Lesser Antilles Arc and Scotia Arc, pointing to action by the ridge push body force on these plates. Computer modeling of the plates and mantle motions suggest that plate motion and mantle convection are not connected, and the main plate driving force is slab pull.\n\nIncreased rates of seafloor spreading (i.e. the rate of expansion of the mid-ocean ridge) has caused global (eustatic) sealevel to rise over very long timescales (millions of years). Increased seafloor spreading means that the mid-ocean ridge will then expand and form a broader ridge with decreased average depth, taking up more space in the ocean basin. This displaces the overlying ocean and causes sea levels to rise.\n\nSealevel change can be attributed to other factors (thermal expansion, ice melting, and mantle convection creating dynamic topography). Over very long timescales, however, it is the result of changes in the volume of the ocean basins which are, in turn, affected by rates of seafloor spreading along the mid-ocean ridges.\n\nThe high sealevel that occurred during the Cretaceous Period (144–65 Ma) can only be attributed to plate tectonics since thermal expansion and the absence of ice sheets by themselves cannot account for the fact that sea levels were 100–170 meters higher than today.\n\nSeafloor spreading on mid-ocean ridges is a global scale ion-exchange system. Hydrothermal vents at spreading centers introduce various amounts of iron, sulfur, manganese, silicon and other elements into the ocean, some of which are recycled into the ocean crust. Helium-3, an isotope that accompanies volcanism from the mantle, is emitted by hydrothermal vents and can be detected in plumes within the ocean.\n\nFast spreading rates will expand the mid-ocean ridge causing basalt reactions with seawater to happen more rapidly. The magnesium/calcium ratio will be lower because more magnesium ions are being removed from seawater and consumed by the rock, and more calcium ions are being removed from the rock and released to seawater. Hydrothermal activity at ridge crest is efficient in removing magnesium. A lower Mg/Ca ratio favors the precipitation of low-Mg calcite polymorphs of calcium carbonate (calcite seas).\n\nSlow spreading at mid-ocean ridges has the opposite effect and will result in a higher Mg/Ca ratio favoring the precipitation of aragonite and high-Mg calcite polymorphs of calcium carbonate (aragonite seas).\n\nExperiments show that most modern high-Mg calcite organisms would have been low-Mg calcite in past calcite seas, meaning that the Mg/Ca ratio in an organism's skeleton varies with the Mg/Ca ratio of the seawater in which it was grown.\n\nThe mineralogy of reef-building and sediment-producing organisms is thus regulated by chemical reactions occurring along the mid-ocean ridge, the rate of which is controlled by the rate of sea-floor spreading.\n\nThe first indications that a ridge bisects the Atlantic Ocean basin came from the results of the British Challenger expedition in the nineteenth century. Soundings from lines dropped to the seafloor were analyzed by oceanographers Matthew Fontaine Maury and Charles Wyville Thomson and revealed a prominent rise in the seafloor that ran down the Atlantic basin from north to south. Sonar echo sounders confirmed this in the early twentieth century.\n\nIt was not until after World War II, when the ocean floor was surveyed in more detail, that the full extent of mid-ocean ridges became known. The \"Vema\", a ship of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, traversed the Atlantic Ocean, recording echo sounder data on the depth of the ocean floor. A team led by Marie Tharp and Bruce Heezen concluded that there was an enormous mountain chain with a rift valley at its crest, running up the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists named it the 'Mid-Atlantic Ridge'. Other research showed that the ridge crest was seismically active and fresh lavas were found in the rift valley. In addition, crustal heat flow was higher here than elsewhere in the Atlantic Ocean basin.\n\nAt first, the ridge was thought to be a feature specific to the Atlantic Ocean. However, as surveys of the ocean floor continued around the world, it was discovered that every ocean contains parts of the mid-ocean ridge system. The German Meteor expedition traced the mid-ocean ridge from the South Atlantic into the Indian Ocean early in the twentieth century. Although the first-discovered section of the ridge system runs down the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, it was found that most mid-ocean ridges are located away from the center of other ocean basins.\n\nAlfred Wegener proposed the theory of continental drift in 1912. He stated: \"the Mid-Atlantic Ridge ... zone in which the floor of the Atlantic, as it keeps spreading, is continuously tearing open and making space for fresh, relatively fluid and hot sima [rising] from depth\". However, Wegener did not pursue this observation in his later works and his theory was dismissed by geologists because there was no mechanism to explain how continents could plow through ocean crust, and the theory became largely forgotten.\n\nFollowing the discovery of the worldwide extent of the mid-ocean ridge in the 1950s, geologists faced a new task: explaining how such an enormous geological structure could have formed. In the 1960s, geologists discovered and began to propose mechanisms for seafloor spreading. The discovery of mid-ocean ridges and the process of seafloor spreading allowed for Wegner's theory to be expanded so that it included the movement of oceanic crust as well as the continents. Plate tectonics was a suitable explanation for seafloor spreading, and the acceptance of plate tectonics by the majority of geologists resulted in a major paradigm shift in geological thinking.\n\nIt is estimated that along Earth's mid-ocean ridges every year of new seafloor is formed by this process. With a crustal thickness of , this amounts to about of new ocean crust formed every year.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1821975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821975", "title": "Prato", "text": "Prato\n\nPrato ( , ) is a city and \"comune\" in Tuscany, Italy, the capital of the Province of Prato. The city lies 17 kilometres north-west of Florence, at the foot of Monte Retaia, elevation , the last peak in the Calvana chain. With more than 195,000 inhabitants, Prato is Tuscany's second largest city (after Florence) and the third largest in Central Italy (after Rome and Florence).\n\nHistorically, Prato's economy has been based on the textile industry. The renowned Datini archives are a significant collection of late medieval documents concerning economic and trade history, produced between 1363 and 1410.\n\nThe city boasts important historical and artistic attractions, with a cultural span that started with the Etruscans and then expanded in the Middle Ages and reached its peak with the Renaissance, when artists such as Donatello, Filippo Lippi and Botticelli left their testimonies in the city.\nThe famous \"cantucci\", a type of biscotti invented in Prato during the Middle Ages, are still produced by local traditional bakers.\n\nArchaeological findings have proved that Prato's surrounding hills were inhabited since Paleolithic times. The plain was later colonized by the Etruscans. In 1998 remains of a previously unknown city from that civilization were discovered in the neighbourhood of Gonfienti near Campi Bisenzio. It was of medium size and it was already a centre for the wool and textile industry. According to some scholars, it could be the mythical Camars. The Etruscan city was inhabited until the 5th century BC, when, for undisclosed reasons, it decayed; control of the area later shifted to the Romans, who had their Via Cassia pass through here, but did not build any settlement.\n\nIn the early Middle Ages, the Byzantine and Lombard dominations prevailed in the region. \n\nThe history of Prato itself begins from the 10th century, when two distinct villages, Borgo al Cornio and \"Castrum Prati\" (Prato's Castle), are known. In the following century the two settlements were united under the lords of the castle, the Alberti family, who received the imperial title of Counts of Prato. In the same period the plain was drained and a hydraulic system regulating and exploiting the waters of the Bisenzio River was created to feed the \"gualchierae\" (pre-industrial textile machines).\n\nAfter a siege in 1107 by the troops of Matilde of Canossa, the Alberti retreated to their family fortresses in the Bisenzio Valley: Prato could therefore develop as a free commune. Within two centuries it reached 15,000 inhabitants, spurred in by the flourishing textile industry and by the presence of the Holy Belt relic. Two new lines of walls had to be built in the mid-12th century, and in the early 14th century. \n\nIn 1326, in order to counter the expansionism of the Republic of Florence, Prato submitted voluntarily under the seigniory of Robert of Anjou, King of Naples. However, on 23 February 1351 Joanna I of Naples sold the city to the Republic of Florence in exchange for 17,500 golden florins. \n\nPrato's history therefore followed that of Florence in the following centuries.\n\nIn 1512, during the War of the Holy League, the city was sacked by Spanish troops assembled by Pope Julius II and the king of Aragón, Ferdinand II, to recover the nearby city of Florence for the Medici family. The severity of the sack of Prato led to the surrender of the Florentine Republic, and to the restoration of the Medici rule. Historians debate the actual number of people killed during the sack, but contemporary chroniclers asserted between 2000 and 6000 people were slaughtered in the streets.\n\nIn 1653 Prato obtained the status of city and became seat of a Catholic diocese. The city was embellished in particular during the 18th century.\nIn the 18th Century, with the ascent of Lorraine at the head of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the city was embellished and also experienced a significant cultural development, which was promoted by the grand dukes themselves.\n\nThe intellectual foresight of Prato and its land in this century finds its maximum expression in the words of Filippo Mazzei, a friend of Thomas Jefferson, which today are reported in the second paragraph of the Constitution of the United States of America: \"All men are created equal\".\n\nAfter the unification of Italy in the 19th century, Prato became a primary industrial centre, especially in the textile sector (Italian historian Emanuele Repetti described it as the \"Italian Manchester\"), and it population grew up to 50,000 in 1901 and to 180,000 in 2001. The town experienced significant internal immigration. Previously part of the province of Florence, in 1992 Prato became the capital of the eponymous province.\n\nPrato is home to many museums and other cultural monuments, including the Filippo Lippi frescoes in the Cathedral of Santo Stefano, recently restored. The Cathedral has an external pulpit by Donatello and Michelozzo, built and still used for the display of the cathedral's famous relic of the Virgin Mary, the Girdle of Thomas (\"Sacra Cintola\", a cord belt), which had a great reputation in the late Middle Ages and is often shown in Florentine art. Also of interest is the Teatro Metastasio, the city's main venue for operas and other theatrical productions, which was built in 1829–30.\n\n\n\n\nOn 8 September each year, to pay homage to the Sacra Cintola, on the day of the birth of the Madonna, there is the \" Corteggio Storico\". The costume parade takes place along the streets of the center, in which the armies of the City, the Corpo dei Valletti Comunali and other hundreds of people from different cities of Italy take part. The procession ends in Piazza del Duomo, where there is the most solemn event of the day: the exposition of the relic of the Holy Girdle.\n\nThe program of the festival is enriched by various performances that are held throughout the day in various points of the historic center, such as, for example, the performance of flag-wavers, shooting with bows, the medieval market with re-enactments of ancient crafts and traditions, musical performances, fireworks.\n\nThe Game of Palla Grossa is back to be played in Prato Piazza Mercatale in September 2012, after almost thirty years of absence. Four districts compete: the Rossi (Santa Trinita), the Gialli (Santo Stefano), the Azzurri (Santa Maria) and the Verdi (San Marco).\n\nContemporanea festival is an international theater festival that takes place in Prato dal 1999. The event takes place at the end of May and presents important artists of the national and international contemporary theater scene.\n\nThe typical Pratese cuisine, as in general that of the whole Tuscany, uses \"poor\" products and ingredients, mainly from the territory.\nThe bread, called \"bozza pratese\", is definitely the basic element of the kitchen. In Prato, as in Florence it is customary to use bread to prepare croutons with the livers, panzanella and pappa al pomodoro.\n\n\nThe main points of reference are the University Campus of Prato (a branch of the Università degli Studi di Firenze)and the Prato Research Foundation which also includes the Istituto Geofisico Toscano, in addition to the creation of a Research Center financed by local authorities and the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nFrom the first nineties the city is home to an important university center with over 2000 registered students, called \"University Campus of Prato\", born from the collaboration between the University of Florence and a consortium company born from the collaboration between local authorities (first of all the Municipality of Prato) and various private subjects, the PIN Scrl, owner of the building (formerly the prestigious Istituto T. Buzzi and renovated for the occasion) which houses the polo. Some courses of study are underway at the faculty of economics, letters and philosophy, engineering, medicine and surgery and political sciences of the Florentine university.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrato has a humid subtropical climate which has sunny hot summers and cool damp winters. July is the driest month of the year.\n\nThe city of Prato is crossed by two railway lines: the Viareggio-Florence Railroad and the Bologna-Florence Railways. The first is a regional line that connects it with Florence and western Tuscany, while the second is part of the Milan-Naples ridge and is one of the most important Italian railway lines. Prato is therefore served by some long-distance trains.\n\nThere are three railway stations in the city:\n\n\nPrato urban transport consists of a series of bus lines operated by CAP (site) which also serves the province. There are a total of 11 active lines, including those LAMs that connect the city center, the surrounding areas and the suburbs with frequencies ranging from seven to fifteen minutes.\n\nThe dialect from Prato is very similar to that of Florence, but it has its own peculiarities. The pronunciation of the city name in the dialect was traditionally but now or are more common.\n\nThe city of Prato has the second largest Chinese immigrant population in Italy (after Milan with Italy's largest Chinatown). Legal Chinese residents in Prato on 31 December 2008 were 9,927. Local authorities estimate the number of Chinese citizens living in Prato to be around 45,000, illegal immigrants included. Most overseas Chinese come from the city of Wenzhou in the province of Zhejiang, some of them having moved from Chinatown in Paris. The first Chinese people came to Prato in the early 1990s. The majority of Chinese work in 3,500 workshops in the garment industry and ready-to-wear. Chinatown, known as Santo Beijing, is located in the west part of the city, spreading to Porta Pistoiese in the historical centre. The local Chamber of Commerce registered over 3,100 Chinese businesses by September 2008. Most of them are located in an industrial park named Macrolotto di Iolo. Raids on factories employing illegal immigrants in 2010 highlighted problems with the growth of an apparel industry in Prato based on cheap, and sometimes illegal, labor. In spite of all these blames, the local unemployment rate was around 7% in 2013, which was significantly lower than the national average 11%, even after 4,000 enterprises which employed 20,000 people were closed in the past two decades. The president of the Industrial Association of Prato, Andrea Cavicchi, pointed out that the local economic performance was much better than the rest of Italy due to those Chinese textile business.\n\n, the Italian and Chinese populations did not socially mix. As of that year, there were 30,000 legal Chinese immigrants, and authorities believed there was a similar number of illegal Chinese immigrants.\n\nPrato is twinned with:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1821978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821978", "title": "Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures", "text": "Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures\n\nMighty Mouse: The New Adventures is an American animated television series. It is a revival of the Mighty Mouse cartoon character. Produced by Bakshi-Hyde Ventures (a joint venture of animator Ralph Bakshi and producer John W. Hyde) and Terrytoons, it aired on CBS on Saturday mornings from fall 1987 through the 1988–89 season. It was briefly rerun on Saturday mornings on Fox Kids in November 1992.\n\nThe quality of \"Mighty Mouse\" as compared with other 1980s animated television series is considered by animation historian Jerry Beck to \"foreshadow the higher quality [animation] boom coming in the next decade.\"\n\nThe series was a commercial half-hour format (22 minutes plus commercials), and each episode consisted of two self-contained 11-minute cartoon segments. It differed from the earlier incarnations of Mighty Mouse in many ways. It gave Mighty Mouse the secret identity of Mike Mouse, a sidekick in the form of the orphan Scrappy Mouse (who knows the hero's secret identity), heroic colleagues such as Bat-Bat and his sidekick Tick the Bug Wonder and the League of Super-Rodents, as well as introduced antagonists like Petey Pate, Big Murray, Madame Marsupial and the Cow (actually a bull, because he is Madame Marsupial's boyfriend and he possesses male traits). The original Mighty Mouse villain Oil Can Harry made a couple of appearances. Pearl Pureheart was not always the damsel in distress and many episodes did not feature her at all. Mighty Mouse's light-operatic singing was eliminated except for his trademark, \"Here I come to save the day!\", which was sometimes interrupted.\n\nUnlike other American animated TV shows of the time (and even Mighty Mouse's past theatrical shorts) the show's format was loose and episodes did not follow a particular formula. Episodes varied from superhero-type stories to parodies of shows like \"The Honeymooners\" (\"Mighty's Wedlock Whimsy\") and the 1960s \"Batman\" series (\"Night of the Bat-Bat\" and \"Bat With a Golden Tongue\"), movies like \"Fantastic Voyage\" (\"Mundane Voyage\") and Japanese monster films (the opening of \"Mighty's Wedlock Whimsy\"), comic books (\"See You in the Funny Papers\"), and even lampooned other cartoons (\"Don't Touch That Dial!\") and specifically \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" (\"Mighty's Benefit Plan\").\n\nThe series resurrected other Terrytoons characters, but acknowledged the passage of time: perennial menace Oil Can Harry returns to chase Pearl Pureheart once more (\"Still Oily After All These Years\"), 1940s characters Gandy Goose and Sourpuss and 1960s character Deputy Dawg are revived (Gandy and Dawg frozen in time in blocks of ice) in \"The Ice Goose Cometh\", \"Gaston Le Crayon\" has a cameo (\"Still Oily After All These Years\") and Bakshi's own 1960 creations—the Mighty Heroes—appear, aged, in the episode \"Heroes and Zeroes\". Fellow Terrytoons characters Heckle and Jeckle also appear in \"Mighty's Wedlock Whimsy\".\n\nThe show was considered revolutionary at the time and, along with 1988's \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", inspired a wave of animated shows that were much zanier than those that had dominated children's animation in the previous two decades. It is credited by some as the impetus for the ‘creator-driven’ animation revolution of the 1990s.\n\nIt was a huge springboard for many cartoonists and animators who would later become famous, among them John Kricfalusi (creator of Nickelodeon's \"The Ren and Stimpy Show\"), Bruce W. Timm (producer of Warner Bros. \"\"), Jim Reardon (writer for Warner Bros. \"Tiny Toon Adventures\" and Disney/Pixar's \"WALL-E\" and director for Fox's \"The Simpsons\"), Tom Minton (writer and producer for many Warner Bros. television cartoons, including \"Tiny Toons\", \"Animaniacs\", \"The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries\", \"Baby Looney Tunes\" and \"Duck Dodgers\"), Lynne Naylor (co-founder of Spümcø, character designer for \"Batman: The Animated Series\" and storyboard artist for Cartoon Network's \"The Powerpuff Girls\" and \"Cow and Chicken\"), Rich Moore (animation director for Fox/Comedy Central's \"Futurama\", director for \"The Simpsons\" and director of Disney's \"Wreck-It Ralph\", \"Zootopia\" and \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\"), and Andrew Stanton (director of Disney/Pixar's \"Finding Nemo\", \"WALL-E\" and \"Finding Dory\") and others. \"The Loud House\" creator Chris Savino says the show's classic cartoon style, which contrasted with the dominant style of TV animation at the time, spurred him to become an animator.\n\nKricfalusi supervised the production for the first season and directed eight of its 26 segments. Kent Butterworth supervised the second season, after John Kricfalusi's departure to work on the similarly short-lived 1988 animated series \"The New Adventures of Beany and Cecil\". The show was licensed as a comic book series published by Marvel Comics in 1990 and 1991, which ran for 10 issues.\n\nIn April 1987, Bakshi set up a meeting with Judy Price, the head of CBS's Saturday morning block. Price rejected Bakshi's prepared pitches, including one featuring John Kricfalusi's \"Ren & Stimpy\" characters, but asked what else he had. He told her that he had the rights to \"Mighty Mouse\" and she agreed to purchase the series. However, Bakshi did not own the rights and did not know who did. While researching the rights, he learned that CBS had acquired the entire Terrytoons library in 1955 and forgotten about it. According to Bakshi, \"I sold them a show they already owned, so they just gave me the rights for nothin'!\"\n\nKricfalusi's team wrote story outlines for 13 episodes in a week and pitched them to Price. By the next week, Kricfalusi had hired animators he knew who had been working at other studios. The key creative figures were writer/cartoonist Tom Minton; cartoonist Eddie Fitzgerald, Lynne Naylor, a designer, animator and layout artist. Jim Smith was key. Bruce Timm did clean up. Libby Simon headed the color department. Vicki Jensen painted the backgrounds. Bob Jaques was the timing director. Minton and Kricfalusi went to CalArts to see who the best talent from the latest crop of graduates were. They ended up hiring Jeff Pidgeon, Rich Moore, Carole Holiday, Andrew Stanton and Nate Kanfer. \"Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures\" went into production in the month it was greenlighted; it was scheduled to premiere on September 19, 1987. This haste required the crew to be split into four teams, led by supervising director Kricfalusi, Fitzgerald, Steve Gordon and Bruce Woodside. Each team was given a handful of episodes and operated almost entirely independently of the others. Although the scripts required approval by CBS executives, Kricfalusi insisted that the artists add visual gags as they drew.\n\nDespite the time constraints, CBS was pleased with the way Bakshi Productions addressed the network's notes. Kricfalusi did not return for the second season and took some of the crew to work on \"The New Adventures of Beany and Cecil\" for ABC.\n\nKricfalusi described \"Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures\" as the origin of the \"'Creator-Driven' revolution\" and that he hired artists \"dissatisfied with the formula cartoons they were forced to work on at other studios\" and as a \"witty, satirical and wildly imaginative\" series and \"quite a revolution when compared to the cartoons being made everywhere else.\" Kricfalusi said that he supervised the development of the cartoon in all aspects except the final editing.\n\nKricfalusi said that he restored the \"old time-director-unit system\" in which three or four directors theoretically supervise all of the creative aspects of each individual cartoon. He said that two of the directors felt \"kind of\" reluctant to participate as they did not \"really approve\" of the direction. Kricfalusi intended for the cartoon to be \"like a Warner Bros. cartoon\", and that the show does not have his personal humor style. He described the team as \"slightly cautious\" in presenting ideas to CBS's executives. Artists were allowed to use their own style in the episodes that they worked on, and that one can determine which artist drew which cartoon based on the styles present. Kricfalusi described Ken Boyer's scenes as \"cute and dynamic\", Istvan's scenes as \"extremely crazy-looking\", his own scenes as \"very specifically acted\",\" Lynne's scenes as \"very girly and cartoony at the same time\" and Jim Smith's scenes as \"manly and well composed\".\n\nWhile an article about the series in \"Amazing Heroes\" #129 made it appear like Bakshi was the director of the show, Kricfalusi clarified that Bakshi was the producer and that Bakshi's creative involvement was the highest during the first several weeks of the production, after which he stood out of the way and let the team go about its business.\n\nIn order to bring down the budget so that layouts could be completed in house, a step normally done overseas by cheap foreign labor, the show opted to build three entire cartoon segments from vintage Terrytoons cartoon stock footage: \"Mighty's Musical Classics\", \"Animation Concerto\" and the bulk of \"Scrappy's Playhouse\". A dream sequence in \"The Ice Goose Cometh\" also utilized Terrytoons footage.\n\nAdditionally, three segments were clip-shows that re-used animation from previous episodes: \"Stress for Success\", \"Anatomy of a Milquetoast\" and \"Mighty's Tone Poem\". Kricfalusi said that the process of using the older animation was not a creative process.\n\nThe show's content sometimes crossed into controversial territory. In “Mighty’s Wedlock Whimsy”, it is hinted that peripheral male characters Gandy Goose and Sour Puss are showering together, and — in a dream sequence — that Pearl Pureheart has a lovechild with Mighty Mouse’s unhinged nemesis the Cow.\n\nDuring the production of the episode \"The Littlest Tramp\", editor Tom Klein expressed concern that a sequence showing Mighty Mouse sniffing the remains of a crushed flower resembled cocaine use. Bakshi did not initially view the footage; he believed that Klein was overreacting, but agreed to let him cut the scene. Kricfalusi expressed disbelief over the cut, insisting that the action was harmless and that the sequence should be restored. Following Kricfalusi's advice, Bakshi told Klein to restore the scene, which had been approved by network executives and the CBS Standards and Practices department. The episode aired on October 31, 1987, initially without controversy.\n\nOn June 6, 1988, Donald Wildmon, head of the American Family Association (AFA), alleged that \"The Littlest Tramp\" depicted cocaine use, instigating a media frenzy. Concerning Bakshi's involvement with \"Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures\", the AFA claimed that CBS \"intentionally hired a known pornographer to do a cartoon for children, and then allowed him to insert a scene in which the cartoon hero is shown sniffing cocaine.\" Bakshi responded, \"You could pick a still out of \"Lady and the Tramp\" and get the same impression. \"Fritz the Cat\" wasn't pornography. It was social commentary. This all smacks of burning books and the Third Reich. It smacks of McCarthyism. I'm not going to get into who sniffs what. This is lunacy!\"\n\nBakshi defended the episode, saying, \"I despise drugs. I would be out of my mind to show a cartoon character snorting cocaine in a cartoon,\" and stating that Wildmon had interpreted the scene out of context. \"Mighty Mouse was happy after smelling the flowers because it helped him remember the little girl who sold it to him fondly. But even if you're right, their accusations become part of the air we breathe. That's why I cut the scene. I can't have children wondering if Mighty Mouse is using cocaine.\" On CBS's order, Klein removed the sequence from the master broadcast footage.\n\nWildmon claimed that the edits were \"a de facto admission that, indeed, Mighty Mouse was snorting cocaine\". Bakshi agreed to the removal of the offending 3½ seconds from future airings of the episode because of his concern that the controversy might lead children to believe that what Wildmon was saying was true. Wildmon's group then demanded the removal of Bakshi but, on July 25, 1988, CBS released a statement in support of him.\n\nOn January 5, 2010, CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount) released the complete series on three DVDs, with every installment of the Saturday morning cartoon uncut and presented in the original full screen video format. The collection includes the uncut version of \"The Littlest Tramp,\" in which the controversial scene begins at 9:41 in the episode, but features an error in the version of \"Mighty's Wedlock Whimsy\" included on the set, where the penultimate live action shot of layout artist Ed Bell is substituted with an animatic version of the shot. The actual shot as aired appears in the included documentary.\n\nAmong the extras are the documentary “Breaking the Mold: The Re-Making of Mighty Mouse” and commentary tracks for several episodes. Also included are three original Terrytoons theatrical Mighty Mouse cartoon shorts, as taken from Paramount's vaults, which are the first-ever official release of Terrytoons material on DVD.\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1990 to 1991, a Mighty Mouse comic book series was published by Marvel Comics. It lasted for 10 issues and took place after the Bakshi television series. Shortly after the events of \"Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures\", Scrappy abandons Mighty and Pearl to spend all his time at the Four Fingers Video Arcade. When the Four Fingers Video Arcade closes down, Scrappy vanishes.\n\nIt is revealed that Mighty Mouse's enemy, the Glove, was behind the Four Fingers Video Arcade. Mighty saves Scrappy in the end, but Scrappy is still \"zapped\" into playing video games. Scrappy is then sent to rehab and is back to normal a few issues later. In the 10th and final issue of the comic, Scrappy substitutes for Pearl Pureheart when she gives up her role in the comic.\n\n\n\n"}

Much of the route through the Sacramento area is unsigned as it runs on a concurrency with the I-5 and US 50 freeways.\n\nSR 16 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 16 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. It is known as the Stanley L. Van Vleck Memorial Highway from Dillard Road in Sacramento County to the Amador County line, honoring a former prominent leader in the state's agricultural organizations.\n\nState Route 16 begins in Colusa County near Wilbur Springs at the junction with State Route 20. SR 16 goes south alongside Bear Creek, which enters a narrow canyon and joins with Cache Creek near the Yolo County line. SR 16 continues in the canyon, running close to the river, passing \"Cache Creek Canyon Regional Park\", and emerging from the canyon north of Rumsey.

It then diverges from US 50 via Howe Ave., goes southward on Howe Ave. for a short distance, then runs eastbound on Folsom Blvd. SR then peels off from Folsom Blvd. less than a mile later as Jackson Road\n\nSR 16 then heads east through Perkins. After it passes near Bridge House and Rancho Murieta, where it crosses the Cosumnes River, SR 16 enters Amador County. SR 16 then ascends into the Sierra Nevada foothills, leaving the Central Valley. In Amador County, SR 16 passes near Forest Home before intersecting with State Route 124 and terminating at State Route 49.\n\nThe two ends of SR 16 were added to the state highway system by the third bond issue, passed by the state's voters in 1919: Route 50 from Lower Lake east to Rumsey and Route 54 from the Sacramento-Amador County line east to Drytown. Each was connected to Sacramento by existing or planned paved county highways. Although the exact alignment of Route 50 was not specified, the state Department of Engineering had already surveyed a 35-mile (56 km) route through Cache Creek Canyon pursuant to a 1915 law, which defined the Yolo and Lake Highway \"following generally, the meanderings of Cache creek\" but did not make it a state highway. By 1924, the California Highway Commission's engineers had realized that building Route 50 through the canyon was impractical, and adopted a substitute plan for two highways connecting Lower Lake and Rumsey with the planned Route 15 (Tahoe-Ukiah Highway, now State Route 20) to the north in September 1925. The western connection, to Lower Lake, became part of Route 49 (now State Route 53 there), which continued south from Lower Lake to Calistoga.\n\nEach route was extended to Sacramento in 1933 over the aforementioned county highways, taking Route 50 southeast from Rumsey to Woodland near Cache Creek and then alongside the Sacramento River to the I Street Bridge, and Route 54 west from the county line to Route 11 just outside Sacramento. The entirety of both routes, from SR 20 near Wilbur Springs through Sacramento to State Route 49 just north of Drytown (and initially overlapping SR 49 to Jackson), was included in the initial state sign route system in 1934 as Sign Route 16. Through downtown Sacramento, SR 16 followed U.S. 40 (Legislative Route 6) and U.S. 50 (Legislative Route 11), mostly on Capitol Avenue, while Legislative Route 50 continued south on 5th Street (later a one-way pair of 3rd and 5th Streets) and turned east on Broadway, carrying Sign Route 24 most of the way to Freeport Boulevard. In the 1964 renumbering, Route 16 became the new legislative designation, and Sign Route 24 through Sacramento was replaced with State Route 99 and State Route 160. As neither of these used what had been Sign Route 24 along 3rd and 5th Streets and Broadway, part of Route 16's new definition (\"Route 5 near Woodland to Sacramento\") was used for several years on this alignment until it became part of State Route 99 later that decade. This left the western segment of SR 16 ending at Interstate 5 near the east end of the I Street Bridge until 1984, when the Woodland-Sacramento portion, which had become redundant with the parallel Interstate 5 complete, was deleted from the legislative definition. After this, SR 16 was rerouted from the intersection with County Route E7 to continue north on a bypass of Woodland instead of east to Interstate 5.\n\nOn September 15, 2014, Assembly Bill No. 1957 was passed, authorizing relinquishment of the segment of SR 16 in Eastern Sacramento near US 50.\n\n"}

In it, the Catholic Church affirmed its position that homosexuality was an \"objective disorder\" and that all support should be withdrawn from any organization that undermined the Church's teaching or were ambiguous about or neglectful of it.\n\nAccording to write Neil Miller, an immediate effect of the document was the decision by several American bishops to order that DignityUSA no longer be allowed to hold Mass in Catholic churches.

Their 1934 production, \"The House of Rothschild\" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. In 1935, they produced the classic film \"Les Misérables\", from Victor Hugo's novel, which was also nominated for Best Picture.\n\nIn the winter of 1934, Zanuck began to negotiate with the UA board to acquire stock of the company and become a board member, but became outraged by UA's co-founder Mary Pickford's refusal to reward Twentieth Century with the company's stock, fearing it would have diluted the value of holdings by another UA stockholder and co-founder, D.W. Griffith. Schenck, who had been a UA stockholder for over ten years, resigned from United Artists in protest of the shoddy treatment of Twentieth Century, and Zanuck; thus began discussions with other distributors, which led to talks with the bankrupt Fox Studios of the Fox Film Corporation in the early spring of 1935. Fox Film had begun in the silent era in 1915 under founder William Fox.\n\nTwentieth Century Pictures of 1933, merged with Fox Studios in 1935 to form 20th Century-Fox (the hyphen was dropped a half century later in 1985 under Australian Rupert Murdoch).

At the start of the Revolutionary Wars he saw active service on the Rhine in 1794 and in Italy in 1795, and in the campaign of 1796–1797 under Napoleon Bonaparte on engineer duties, commanding the bridging train of the French Army of Italy after June 1796, and fought with distinction at the Battle of the Bridge of Arcole and the Siege of Mantua..\n\nHe was promoted to brigadier general in 1798, in which year he accompanied Bonaparte to Egypt. He served in the Egyptian Campaign with distinction—he commanded the French flotilla on the Nile, before serving as Marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier's \"aide-de-camp\" in Syria—and was selected as one of Napoleon's companions on his return to Europe.\n\nAndréossy took part in the coup d'état of the 18 Brumaire, and on 6 January 1800 was made general of Général de division. Of particular importance was his term of office as ambassador to Great Britain during the short peace which followed the treaties of Amiens and Lunéville. It had been shown (Coquille, Napoleon and England, 1904) that Andréossy repeatedly warned Napoleon that the British government desired to maintain peace but must be treated with consideration. His advice, however, was disregarded. When Napoleon became emperor he made Andréossy inspector-general of artillery, a \"Chevalier de l'Empire\" (1803) and on 24 February 1809, Count of the First French Empire.\n\nIn the war of 1805 Andréossy was employed on the headquarters staff of Napoleon. From 1808 to 1809 he was French ambassador at Vienna, where he displayed a hostility to Austria which was in marked contrast to his friendliness to England in 1802-1803. In the war of 1809, Andréossy was military governor of Vienna during the French occupation. In 1812 he was sent by Napoleon as ambassador to Ambassador to The Porte in Constantinople, where he carried on the policy initiated by Sébastiani. In 1814 he was recalled by Louis XVIII. Andréossy then retired into private life, until the escape of Napoleon from Elba once again called him forth. He accepted the office of head of the War Department. After the defeat at Waterloo and the abdication of Napoleon, he was one of the five commissioners sent to negotiate with the Coalition powers, on which occasion he gave his consent to the recall of Louis XVIII.\n\nAndréossy held high administrative office under the Bourbon Restoration, including Chief of General Staff and Councillor of State. He was awarded honorary fellowship of the \"Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques\" in 1826, He was later elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1827, representing Aude as Deputy until his death in 1828. His name is inscribed in his memory under the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nAndréossy's numerous works included the following:\n\nAndréossy also wrote scientific memoirs on the mouth of the Black Sea (1818-1819); on certain Egyptian lakes (during his stay in Egypt); and in particular the history of the Languedoc Canal (\"Histoire du canal du Midi\", 2nd ed., Paris, 1804), the chief credit of which he claimed for his ancestor. Andréossy died at Montauban in 1828.\n\nOn 15 September 1810, Andréossy married Marie-Florimonde-Stéphanie de Faÿ, daughter of Charles, marquis de La Tour-Maubourg. Their only son, Étienne-Auguste (1811-1835), succeeded as the 2nd Count Andréossy in 1828 and was also a promising French Army officer but died unmarried in a riding accident, when the title became extinct; the Dowager Countess Stéphanie died on 21 February 1868 in Haute-Garonne.\n\n\n\n\nAttribution\n\n\n"}

It is used in a legal context for such areas as warranty contracts from manufacturers, which usually stipulate that damage from \"wear and tear\" will not be covered.\n\nWear and tear is a form of depreciation which is assumed to occur even when an item is used competently and with care and proper maintenance. For example, repeated impacts may cause stress to a hammer's head. This stress is impossible to prevent in the normal use of the tool for its designed task, and any attempt to avert it impedes its functionality. At the same time, it is expected that the normal use of a hammer will not break it beyond repair during a reasonable life cycle.\n\nThe phenomenon of wear and tear reflects the second law of thermodynamics, in which objects stray from their original form and function over time unless energy from an external force is used to maintain them. If restoration is impossible, an object is regarded as consumable. Parts that are designed to wear inside a machine—e.g., bearings and O-rings—are intended to be replaced with new ones; consumables like paper, cardboard, fabrics, and product packaging are designed with a service life commensurate with their intended use. For example, grocery stores may issue customers a paper or plastic sack to carry out groceries, but it is intended that the sack will have a short lifespan before wear and tear would cause it to fail.\n\nDurable goods (e.g., automobiles, heavy machinery, mainframe computers, musical instruments, handguns, water heaters) are designed with wear parts that are maintained generally by replacement of parts. One way to determine if a good is durable or not is whether a service technician or repairman would typically attempt repairs on it. A specialist may need to be consulted, such as an auto mechanic, a computer technician, a luthier, a gunsmith, or a plumber. An automobile's engine may be repairable with a simple adjustment or replacement of a single and inexpensive broken part. Similarly, an electric water heater element that fails from years of wear and tear may be replaced rather than the entire water heater.\n\nWhereas an automobile needs consumable fuel and lubricants to operate, components such as tires, seats, and paint are subject to wear and tear and typically are not covered under any warranty when subjected to normal use.\n\n\n"}

He is now known best for his writings concerning ancient myths, especially his book \"Anacalypsis\", published posthumously, in which he asserts a commonality among various religious myths, which he traces back to the supposed lost religion of Atlantis. He has been termed a \"political radical, reforming county magistrate and idiosyncratic historian of religions\".\n\nHiggins was the son of Godfrey Higgins of Skellow Grange, near Doncaster. He was educated in Hemsworth before being admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1790, and transferring to Trinity Hall in 1791. He later studied law at the Inner Temple, but was not granted a license to practice law, and refrained from practice. When Napoleon threatened an invasion of the United Kingdom, Higgins joined the Volunteer Corps and became a Captain of the Third West York Militia. In 1800 he married Jane Thorpe, who gave birth to his son, also named Godfrey, and two daughters, Jane and Charlotte. After Higgins' promotion to the rank of major in 1808, he resigned from the Volunteer Corps citing a severe fever as reason. Soon thereafter he was appointed as magistrate or justice of the peace in Yorkshire.\n\nHiggins' work as a magistrate featured reformist campaigns, as part of which he \"courageously exposed the scandalous treatment of pauper lunatics and campaigned for Parliamentary Reform, criticizing excessive taxation, the Corn Laws, and the exploitation of children in factories\". He was also favoured disestablishing the Church of Ireland. In 1814 he had a major role in uncovering the abuse of patients at the York Lunatic Asylum after rumours of serious misconduct had come to his attention. He joined Quaker William Tuke in agitating for reform. In a surprise visit he forced staff to open doors which revealed female patients kept in \"a number of secret cells in a state of filth, horrible beyond description...the most miserable objects I ever beheld.\" Most of the staff were dismissed and Higgins was able to secure a government enquiry into the management of the asylum, at which he gave evidence. Higgins was appointed as a Governor of the Asylum. He proceeded to investigate a suspicious fire that had destroyed many of the asylum's records, concluding that it was unlikely to have started by accident.\n\nMeanwhile, he developed a regimen to study the meaning of life and religion, and wrote:\n\nI came to a resolution to devote six hours a day to this pursuit for ten years. Instead of six hours daily for ten years, I believe I have, upon the average, applied myself to it for nearly ten hours daily for almost twenty years. In the first ten years of my search I may fairly say, I found nothing which I sought for; in the latter part of the twenty, the quantity of matter has so crowded in upon me, that I scarcely know how to dispose of it.\nA keen antiquarian, Higgins was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. According to Ross Nichols, Higgins was also a \"Chosen Chief\" of the Order of Druids, founded by John Toland in 1717. Higgins was claimed a member of An Uileach Druidh Braithreaches (The Druid Order), an ancient Druid order that predates the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn; however, these claims are unsubstantiated. Regardless, Higgins demonstrated extensive knowledge and familiarity with the traditions of Druid orders in his work, \"The Celtic Druids\".\n\nHiggins' wife died on 18 May 1822. Higgins' own death, on 9 August 1833, resulted from an illness which he suffered while attending a meeting of The British Association for the Advancement of Science at Cambridge.\n\nHiggins' main writings were part of the syncretism of the day, which was an attempt to associate Biblical narratives to evidence emerging about other religious traditions. Higgins discussed, and argued with, other authors of this tradition such as Jacob Bryant, Roger O'Connor and William Jones. Higgins' own writings, especially \"Anacalypsis\", were later to have a major influence on the development of Theosophy, through the publications of Helena Blavatsky.\n\nAccording to Ronald Hutton, Higgins' \"Anacalypsis\" says that,\n\nThese ideas \"lay dormant for about forty years, and was then taken up and given a considerable popularity by one of the century's truly international figures, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky\".\n\nHutton describes Higgins as an \"occultist and mystic\", and Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke also terms him an \"occultist\". Nevertheless, Wouter Hanegraaff, who has written a detailed history of esotericism, says that Higgins had no interest in either occultism or esotericism. Higgins main interests were the history of religious beliefs and practical sociology.\n\n\n\n'\"One thing is clear—the mythos of the Hindus, the mythos of the Jews and the mythos of the Greeks are all at bottom the same; and what are called their early histories are not histories of humankind, but are contrivances under the appearance of histories to perpetuate doctrines.\" Higgins bluntly declares that every ancient author, without exception, has come to us through the medium of Christian editors who have \"either from roguery or folly, corrupted them all.”\n\n\n\"There seems to be nothing improbable in these Ethiopians being the tribe of the Jews—the tribe of Jacob or Israel. I think these Ethiopians did come under Jacob, and did settle in Goshen, and gave the names of Maturea and Avaris to the city in which they dwelt.\" Page 399\n\n\n\"All the hero Gods Theseus, Bacchus, Æsculapius, &c., were saviours and black saviours too. These black icons were made when man himself was black. He made his God after himself, and then said that man was made after the image of God.\"\n\n\n"}

The stadium that has been used the longest by an NFL team is Lambeau Field, home of the Green Bay Packers since 1957.\n\nStadiums represent a considerable expense to a community, and thus their construction, use, and funding often enters the public discourse. Also, given the perceived advantage a team gets from playing in their home stadium, particular attention is given in the media to the peculiarities of each stadium's environment. Weather, playing surface (either natural or artificial turf), and the presence or lack of a roof or dome all contribute to giving each team its home-field advantage.\n\nThe following stadiums have hosted, or will host, regular season games outside of the United States as part of the NFL International Series:\n\nOccasionally, a team's home games are moved from their usual site to another location, usually either due to natural disasters, or to the stadium being in use for other events. The list of temporary home stadiums is ordered by the date on which the game using the temporary location was played.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1822041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822041", "title": "Expo '74", "text": "Expo '74\n\nExpo '74 was the first environmentally themed world's fair. It was held in the northwest United States in Spokane, Washington, and ran for six months, from May 4 to November 3, 1974. The heart of the fair park grounds was located on Canada Island, Havermale Island, and the adjacent south bank of the Spokane River in the center of the city.\n\nWith the exception of two pavilions, all of the major buildings were modular structures assembled on the site. The fair had 5.2 million visitors and was considered a success, nearly breaking even, revitalizing the blighted urban core, and pumping an estimated $150 million into the local economy and surrounding region.\n\nIn proclaiming itself the first exposition on an environmental theme, Expo '74 distanced itself from the more techno-centric world's fairs of the 1960s. The environmental theme was promoted in several high-profile events, such as a symposium on United Nations World Environment Day (June 5) attended by more than 1,200 people including many international representatives, and ECAFE Day for the United Nations Economic Council for Asia and the Far East (June 14) that discussed regional environment issues.\n\nSpokane was the smallest city to host a world's fair recognized by the Bureau International des Expositions until Knoxville, Tennessee held the 1982 World's Fair eight years later (although the Spokane metropolitan area is still smaller than the Knoxville metropolitan area). World's Fairs began at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution as public showcases. Expo '74 was the first fair in decades that did not focus on the space age, futuristic themes, or utopian ideas of living. An environmental theme was decided upon by the organizing committee, however there was some uncertainty about it because it had never been used previously by a World's Fair to that time. After considering several other slogans, such as \"How Man Can Live, Work and Play in Harmony With His Environment\", Expo '74 settled on \"Celebrating Tomorrow's Fresh New Environment.\"\nUncertainty about the ability of a city the modest size of Spokane to create a successful event caused many nations and corporations to hesitate about making major investments in the fair. Kodak, General Motors, and Ford hosted pavilions at this fair but they were scaled down in size and presence compared to the exhibits constructed for the New York Worlds Fair ten years earlier. For the first time since the company's beginning, General Electric did not have a fair pavilion but it sponsored the musical group Up with People that performed during the summer at the fair. Pacific Northwest Bell had a pavilion that eliminated the use of air conditioning by using louvered panels on the roof. They demonstrated the use of TTY equipment and discussed the use of 911 for emergency telephone services. Expo '74 was the last time that the Bell system would exhibit at a world's fair before its breakup ten years later.\n\nNations with an official presence at the fair included Australia, Canada, West Germany, Iran, Japan, Taiwan, Republic of Korea, the United States and the USSR. Architectural critics were intrigued by the Australian Pavilion with its 36 screen revolving audio visual platform and a model of the newly completed Sydney Opera House. (The artistic director for the project was film director Jonathan Dawson). However, writer Calvin Trillin tartly commented that the exhibits of several other countries seemed designed to demonstrate their nation's lack of environmental care. \"While other world's fairs had introduced the telephone, the escalator, and the Belgian waffle, Spokane's Expo '74 would be associated forever with the 'institutionalized mea culpa,'\" Trillin wrote in \"The New Yorker\".\n\nPresident Richard M. Nixon presided over the fair's opening ceremony, where he addressed a crowd of some 85,000, including a few hecklers who shouted \"Jail to the Chief!\" Three months later, Nixon resigned due to the Watergate Scandal.\n\nOne piece of technology that made its debut at Expo '74 was the IMAX movie theater. The original theater, built inside of the United States Pavilion, had a screen that measured , completely covering the front wall of the pavilion. It was the largest indoor movie screen at the time and had bigger dimension than a typical drive-in movie screen. 'The quote, \"The Earth does not belong to Man, Man belongs to the Earth\" (attributed to Chief Seattle) was written in large letters on the outside wall. Inside the pavilion, visitors watched \"Man Belongs to the Earth,\" a 23-minute IMAX film made for Expo by Paramount. Scenes of U.S. splendor led into environmental problems including air pollution in Denver. The film was so realistic—especially during a sequence flying through the Grand Canyon—that motion sickness bags had to be made available.'\n\nThe fair also featured the interactive movie system Kinoautomat.\nAfter the event closed, the exposition site became the city's Riverfront Park, containing the former U.S. Pavilion and a clock tower (part of a Great Northern rail depot that was demolished for Expo '74), which prominently featured the park's logo.\n\nSeveral structures built for the fair are still standing. The United States Pavilion still houses an IMAX theater built after the fair (The original one built for the fair beneath the pavilion was abandoned), as well as a winter ice rink that is put to other varied uses in the warm months. Plans are being made, however, for a new design for the pavilion that will eliminate the IMAX theater. The Washington State Pavilion still stands and is used as the Spokane Convention Center and the First Interstate Center for the Arts. The building constructed to house Spokane's iconic Looff Carousel was disassembled in March 2017 (it housed a French restaurant during the fair), with a new building planned. The carousel (which in Spokane is spelled \"carrousel\") originated in Natatorium Park, which closed in 1967, and was restored for the World's Fair. An additional six structures, including the Republic of China Pavilion, were moved 150 miles south to Walla Walla where they were re-purposed to be used as classrooms and a performing arts theater for the Walla Walla Community College.\n\nThe original covering of the US pavilion was a thick vinyl sheeting that was not designed to last. It was allowed to remain until it began to deteriorate, become unsightly and was thought a safety hazard. When the city opted to remove the covering, chunks of the thick vinyl could be purchased as keep-sakes. The tent design itself with its heavy cables was not intended to stay up, however the people of Spokane voiced the opinion that it should remain as a unique architectural statement, and a monument to the 1974 exposition.\n\nSouvenirs are still available at The White Elephant in Spokane.\n\nDance: Cheremosh Ukrainian Dance Company\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1822048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822048", "title": "The Fugitive (TV series)", "text": "The Fugitive (TV series)\n\nThe Fugitive is an American crime drama television series created by Roy Huggins. It was produced by QM Productions and United Artists Television. It aired on ABC from September 1963 to August 1967. David Janssen starred as Dr. Richard Kimble, a physician who is wrongfully convicted of his wife's murder and sentenced to receive the death penalty. En route to death row, Dr. Richard Kimble's train derails over a switch, allowing him to escape and begin a cross-country search for the real killer, a \"one-armed man\" (played by Bill Raisch). At the same time, Dr. Kimble is hounded by the authorities, most notably by Police Lieutenant Philip Gerard (Barry Morse).\n\n\"The Fugitive\" aired for four seasons, and a total of 120 episodes, each 51 minutes, were produced. The first three seasons (90 hour-long episodes) were filmed in black and white, while the final season (30 hour-long episodes) was filmed in color.\n\n\"The Fugitive\" was nominated for five Emmy Awards and won the Emmy for Outstanding Dramatic Series in 1966. In 2002, it was ranked No. 36 on \"TV Guide\"s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. \"TV Guide\" named the one-armed man No. 5 in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.\n\nThe series premise was set up in the opening narration, but the full details about the crime were not offered in the pilot episode; at the time of the pilot, Kimble has been on the run for six months, having exhausted all of his appeals against his death sentence. While in transit, the train carrying Kimble derails, and Kimble becomes the titular 'fugitive' in an attempt to clear his name. In the series' first season, the premise (heard over footage of Kimble handcuffed to Gerard on a train) was summarized in the opening title sequence of the pilot episode as follows:\n\nThis title sequence was shortened starting with episode 7 through the remainder of the first season as follows:\n\nThe main title narration, as read by William Conrad, was changed for the first episode of the second season on through the last episode of the series:\n\nIt was not until episode 14, \"The Girl from Little Egypt\", that viewers were offered the full details of Richard Kimble's plight. A series of flashbacks reveals the fateful night of Helen Kimble's death, and for the first time offers a glimpse of the \"One-Armed Man\".\n\nThe show's lead, and the only character seen in all 120 episodes, was Dr. Richard David Kimble (David Janssen), based in part on the story of Sam Sheppard.\n\nThough Dr. Richard Kimble was a respected pediatrician in the fictional small town of Stafford, Indiana, it was generally known that he and his wife Helen had been having arguments prior to her death. Helen's pregnancy had ended in a stillborn birth of a son, and surgery to save her life had also rendered her infertile. The couple was devastated, but Helen refused to consider adopting children as Richard wanted. On the night of Helen's murder, the Kimbles had been heard, earlier the same day, arguing heatedly over this topic by their neighbors. Richard later went out for a drive to cool off; as he was returning home, he nearly struck with his car a man with only one arm, who was seen fleeing five blocks away from the house. Richard then found that Helen had been killed. But no one had seen or heard Richard go out for his drive, or seen him while he was out, and so he was unjustly convicted of Helen's murder and sentenced to death in the electric chair.\n\nAfter the train wreck and his escape from custody, Kimble moves from town to town, always trying to remain unobtrusive and unnoticed as he evades capture and hopes to find the one-armed man. He adopts many nondescript aliases, toils at low-paying menial jobs (i.e. those that require no identification or security checks, and bring about little social attention), and has a romance with a damsel in distress. He then chooses to put his anonymity at risk by aiding a deserving person, usually a woman or child. A frequent plot device is for someone to discover Kimble's true identity and use it to manipulate him, under the threat of turning him in to the police.\n\nDr. Richard Kimble is smart and resourceful, and is usually able to perform well at any job he takes. He also displays considerable prowess in hand-to-hand combat. In the episode \"Nemesis\", he distracts, then knocks out, a forest ranger (played by Kurt Russell's father Bing), then quickly unloads the man's rifle to ensure he cannot shoot him if pursued. In the sixth episode, Kimble revealed that he had served as a doctor in the Korean War.\n\nDavid Janssen's understated portrayal skillfully captured the essence of Dr. Richard Kimble's plight. He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama in 1965, and was nominated in 1966. He was nominated three times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (1964, 1966, 1967).\n\nDr. Richard Kimble is pursued by the relentless Stafford police detective Lt. Philip Gerard (Morse), a formidably intelligent family man and dedicated public servant. Gerard directly appears in 37 episodes and also in the main title sequences of all 120 episodes; Barry Morse is also listed in the closing credits of every episode.\n\nMorse portrayed Gerard as a man duty-bound to capture Kimble. Guilt or innocence was of no consequence to Gerard, whose own beliefs have been stated as follows:\nIn \"Never Wave Goodbye Pt. I\", he states again, \"The \"law\" pronounced him guilty, not me.\" In \"Nightmare at Northoak\" and \"Wife Killer\", he states with certainty that the one-armed man does not exist and that Kimble is guilty; in \"Corner of Hell\", even after his own Kimble-like experience, he still scoffs at the existence of the one-armed man. (\"Still the same fairy tale\", he sneers.) He also tells Kimble, \"The truth is, you're still guilty before the law.\"\n\nContributing to Gerard's obsession with re-capturing Kimble is the personal responsibility he feels for Kimble's escape, which happened while he was under Gerard's custody. As he remarks to an LA police captain in \"The Judgment, Part 1\", the show's penultimate episode, \"I've lost a lot of things these past four years ... starting with a prisoner the state told me to guard.\"\n\nOver time, Gerard also appeared to have gained some doubts as to Kimble's guilt. In one episode, when a woman witness remarks that Kimble killed his wife, Gerard simply replies, \"The law says he did.\" But there is a tone of doubt audible in his voice. In the episode \"Nemesis\", the local sheriff (John Doucette) states, \"You said he's a killer.\" To this, Gerard sharply replies, \"The jury said that.\" Gerard's doubts are augmented after Kimble rescues Gerard in episodes such as \"Never Wave Goodbye\", \"Corner of Hell\", \"Ill Wind\", \"The Evil Men Do\", and \"Stroke of Genius\". \"The Evil Men Do\", in particular, played on the respect that develops between the two men when Gerard is pursued by former Mob hitman Arthur Brame (James Daly), who is rescued from a runaway horse by Kimble; Kimble rescues Gerard from Brame. When Kimble escapes from Gerard, the lieutenant, instead of pursuing Kimble, goes after, and kills Brame. In the epilogue, Gerard explains to Brame's widow Sharon (Elizabeth Allen) that he wanted to go after both men, but that Arthur was a career killer and far more dangerous while Kimble \"has done the one murder he'd probably ever do.\" Gerard comes close to acknowledging Kimble's innocence when he concludes, \"Until I find him, and I will, he's no real menace to anyone but himself.\"\n\nIn the course of the series, Gerard's family becomes entangled in Gerard's obsession with finding Kimble. In \"Nemesis\", Kimble unintentionally kidnaps Gerard's young son Philip Junior (played by 12-year-old Kurt Russell). Though as concerned as any father should be, Gerard is confident that Kimble will not do his boy any real harm. After his experience with Kimble, Philip Junior questions whether he is guilty and his father openly admits that he could be wrong, though it does not change his duty. This almost inhuman dedication to his duty strains his relationship with his wife Marie (Barbara Rush) almost to the breaking point and causes her to leave him in season three's two-part episode \"Landscape with Running Figures;\" her actually coming into contact with Kimble (unknowingly at first) causes an emotional collapse when she realizes who he is, with her screaming at Kimble, \"It began with you – it'll END with you!\" It is clear that Gerard does indeed love his wife when he finally chooses to go and find her over chasing Kimble. (Gerard admits to Marie, however, that he will go again when the next time comes: \"He's stuck in my throat and I can't swallow him.\")\n\nWhen Gerard finally captures Kimble in Part 1 of \"The Judgment\", he does not gloat over the arrest, reflecting his respect for his adversary and possibly his recollections of Kimble's past attempts to save him and help others while on the run. \"I'm sorry\", he says. \"You just ran out of time.\" His decision to give Kimble 24 hours to clear himself in Part 2 of \"The Judgment\" also reflects that respect and his increasing doubts of Kimble's guilt regardless of the conviction. That leads to the climactic scenes where the truth of Helen Kimble's murder emerges along with an eyewitness, family friend and war hero Lloyd Chandler, who was at the Kimble home, witnessed Fred Johnson murder Helen Kimble, but was too cowardly to intervene. Ironically, as Kimble and Johnson fight atop a carnival ride, Gerard fatally shoots Johnson just before he can shoot Kimble. Gerard firmly tells Chandler \"you can keep that man (Kimble) alive. But you won't.\" Gerard's comments lead Chandler to agree to testify. After Kimble is exonerated in court, Gerard encounters Kimble leaving, silently smiles and offers his hand. After hesitating, Kimble shakes it.\n\nThere are parallels to be seen between Gerard's pursuit of Kimble and the pursuit of Jean Valjean by Inspector Javert in \"Les Misérables\", though Javert never lets go of his obsession to follow the letter of the law and hunts down his fugitive, even killing himself when he discovers that he cannot reconcile his tenets with the mercy Valjean shows him. Gerard, on the other hand, was portrayed externally as a man like Javert, but internally as more of a thinking man who could balance justice and duty. According to some of those who worked on the show, these parallels were not coincidental. Stanford Whitmore, who wrote the pilot episode \"Fear in a Desert City\", says that he deliberately gave Kimble's nemesis a similar-sounding name to see if anyone would recognize the similarity between \"Gerard\" and \"Javert\". One who recognized the similarity was Morse; he pointed out the connection to Quinn Martin, who admitted that \"The Fugitive\" was a \"sort of modern rendition of the outline of \"Les Misérables\".\" Morse accordingly went back to the Victor Hugo novel and studied the portrayal of Javert, to find ways to make the character more complex than the \"conventional 'Hollywood dick'\" as whom Gerard had originally been conceived. \"I've always thought that we in the arts ... are all ‘shoplifters’\", Morse said. \"Everybody, from Shakespeare onwards and downwards ... But once you've acknowledged that ... when you set out on a shoplifting expedition, you go always to Cartier's, and never to Woolworth's!\"\n\n\"The One-Armed Man\" (Bill Raisch) is a shadowy figure, seen fleeing Kimble's house by Kimble after the murder of Helen. The series revealed little about the man's personal life, especially not how or when he lost his right arm.\n\nIn the 29th episode of the first season (\"Storm Center\"), it is revealed that Helen Kimble was strangled. This is not the method of choice for a man with only one arm.\n\nThe One-Armed Man was rarely seen in the series, appearing in person in only ten episodes. He also appears in the opening credits beginning with season two, and in a photograph in the episode \"The Breaking of the Habit\". He is seen infrequently in the first three seasons, and has almost no actual dialogue until season four, when his character begins to take a more prominent part in the plotline.\n\nThe One-Armed Man is aware that Kimble is after him, and frequently tips off the police as to Kimble's whereabouts, most notably in \"Nobody Loses All The Time\", when he telephones his girlfriend (Barbara Baxley) at a hospital and orders her to call the police – even though Kimble risked arrest to save her life.\n\nLike Kimble, he uses a variety of aliases and holds down various jobs while on the run. In the episode \"A Clean And Quiet Town\", he is credited as \"Steve Cramer\" and works as a mob-employed numbers runner. In the episode \"The Ivy Maze\", he poses as a college janitor and groundskeeper named \"Carl Stoker\". He goes by the name \"Fred Johnson\" in several episodes; first in the season-two episode \"Escape into Black\", where he works as a dishwasher using this name. In the season-three episode \"Wife Killer\", reporter Barbara Webb (Janice Rule) discovers that the One-Armed Man carries a wide range of identification using various names. As \"Fred Johnson\", he has a membership in an athletic club, and a receipt for the sale of a pint of blood – this particular receipt shows that his blood type is B negative, and that he claims his age as 47. (Raisch himself was 60 years of age when this episode was filmed.) The other identities used by the One-Armed Man are not revealed in the episode, although as Barbara flips through a wallet full of I.D., she notes that he is \"a man of many identities, not one of them the same.\"\n\nThe One-Armed Man is identified as Fred Johnson in the two-part series finale, \"The Judgment\". He is also referred to as Johnson in \"The Ivy Maze\" (where he is posing as \"Carl Stoker\") and at one point Fritz Simpson (William Windom) addresses him as \"Fred\". (That episode is where Kimble, Gerard, and the One-Armed Man all appear in the same scene for the first time). This is the only consistent name that they have to go by, and both Gerard and Kimble refer to the One-Armed Man as \"Fred Johnson\" in a few later episodes; in the series finale Lloyd Chandler (J.D. Cannon) also refers to him as Johnson. However, when interrogated by Lt. Gerard in \"The Judgment\", the One-Armed Man denies that Fred Johnson is his real name. While the character's real name is never definitively established, a case could be made that it is \"Gus Evans\"; as revealed in \"The Judgment\", that was the name that he used \"before\" killing Helen Kimble, when he would presumably have had no need to adopt an alias.\n\nBill Raisch played a bitter war veteran who starts a bar fight with Kirk Douglas' John W. Burns in the 1962 film \"Lonely are the Brave.\" The role was a natural lead-in to his part in \"The Fugitive.\"\n\nDr. Richard Kimble's murdered wife Helen (née Waverly) was portrayed in flashbacks in two episodes, season one's \"The Girl from Little Egypt\" and uncredited in season four's \"The Judgment: Part II\" by Diane Brewster. Brewster's uncredited voice is also heard in recorded messages of Helen's voice in season two's \"The Survivors\". Jacqueline Scott as Dr. Richard Kimble's married sister, Donna Taft, appeared in 4 stories, including the 2 part series finale. Her husband, Dr. Richard Kimble's brother-in-law, Leonard Taft, appeared in 3 of those stories and was played by a different actor each time: James B. Sikking in Season 1, Lin McCarthy in Season 3, and Richard Anderson in the 2 part Season 4 finale. Paul Birch appeared as Captain Carpenter, Gerard's superior at the Stafford, Indiana, police department, in 13 episodes of seasons 1 & 2. Gerard's wife, Marie Gerard appeared in 3 stories, played by a different actress each time. In \"Never Wave Goodbye, Part One\" she was briefly played by Rachel Ames, and by British-born actress Mavis Neal Palmer, uncredited in \"May God Have Mercy\", and in the 2 part story \"Landscape with Running Figures\", the only story in which hers is a major role, she is played by Barbara Rush. The nun Sister Veronica (played by Eileen Heckart) appears in two stories: season one's two-part episode \"Angels Travel on Lonely Roads\" and season four's \"The Breaking of the Habit\". She is the only character with no direct ties to Kimble's family or the murder of Helen Kimble to appear in more than one story.\n\nIn season one, episode 15, Billy Mumy and Clint Howard appear in roles as Kimble's nephews, sons of Kimble's sister Donna. \nThere were 4 episodes with two parts over the course of the series, all of them featuring characters in both parts. \"Never Wave Goodbye\" features in both parts, in addition to Gerard, Susan Oliver as Karen Christian, Robert Duvall as her brother Eric, and Lee Philips as Dr. Ray Brooks, with Karen and Richard Kimble falling in love, while Ray pines for Karen. \"Angels Travel on Lonely Roads\" has in both parts, in addition to Sister Veronica, Albert Salmi as Chuck Mathers, the brutish owner of a gas station who gives Kimble trouble and later tries to collect the reward money when he finds out who Kimble is; and, filling in for Gerard (this is the only two-parter in which Gerard does not appear) Sandy Kenyon as a local sheriff and Ken Lynch as a local plainclothes police detective. \"Landscape with Running Figures\" has in both parts, in addition to Lt. Gerard and Mrs. Gerard, Herschel Bernardi and Jud Taylor as two local plainclothes police officers assisting Gerard in the manhunt. The series finale, \"The Judgment\", has, in both parts, in addition to Gerard, Donna, Leonard, and the One-Armed Man, also Diane Baker as a Kimble family friend from Stafford, Jean Carlisle, and she leaves arm in arm with Dr. Richard Kimble in the final scene of the series.\n\nOnly the character of Dr. Richard Kimble is present onscreen in every episode; off-screen narrator William Conrad is also heard at the beginning and end of each episode even though he was never credited, while a different voice announces the title of the episode and the names of the episode's guest stars in the opening teaser. That announcer (an uncredited Dick Wesson) also says, \"The Fugitive\" aloud at the end of the closing credits leading into studio sponsorships of the series (\"'The Fugitive' has been brought to you by ...\"). \"The Untouchables\", which was Martin's first series as a producer, also contained both a narrator (Walter Winchell) and an announcer (Les Lampson), as did \"The New Breed\", the first series QM Productions ever produced, with Wesson as the announcer and Art Gilmore as the narrator.\n\nWith 120 episodes and typically two or more guest stars per episode, the series offered a massive who's who of stars from stage and screen, character actors, and up-and-coming talent. Many guest stars appeared as different characters in multiple episodes. Here is a partial list:\n\n\nOther notable guest star appearances (in alphabetical order):\n\nThe series was conceived by Roy Huggins and produced by Quinn Martin. It is popularly believed that the series was based in part on the real-life story of Sam Sheppard, an Ohio doctor accused of murdering his wife. However, Huggins repeatedly denied basing the series on Sheppard.\n\nAlthough convicted and imprisoned, Sheppard claimed that his wife had been murdered by a \"bushy-haired man\". Sheppard's brothers hired F. Lee Bailey to appeal the conviction. Bailey defended Sheppard and won an acquittal in the second trial. Coincidentally, the show's music supervisor, Ken Wilhoit, was married to Susan Hayes, who had had an intimate relationship with Sheppard prior to the murder and testified during the first trial in 1954.\n\nThe show presents a popular plot device of an innocent man on the run from the police for a murder he did not commit while simultaneously pursuing the real killer. It had its antecedents in the Alfred Hitchcock movies \"The 39 Steps\", \"Saboteur\", and \"North by Northwest.\" The theme of a doctor in hiding for committing a major crime had also been depicted by James Stewart as the mysterious “Buttons the Clown”, who never removed his makeup, in \"The Greatest Show on Earth.\" Writer David Goodis claimed that the series was inspired by his 1946 novel \"Dark Passage\", about a man who escapes from prison after being wrongly convicted of killing his wife. Goodis' litigation over the issue continued for some time after his 1967 death.\n\nIt has also been speculated that another part of the plot device of a fugitive living a life on the run from the authorities was loosely inspired by Victor Hugo's 1862 novel \"Les Misérables\" ,and that the Richard Kimble character was inspired by the novel's protagonist, Jean Valjean, an ex-convict living a life as a fugitive and having numerous aliases as well as helping people around him. The character of Lt. Gerard, who hounds Kimble throughout the series, is also loosely inspired by a character from the same novel, a relentless police inspector named Javert, who is obsessed with capturing the fugitive.\n\nOther shows, such as \"Route 66\", had employed the same anthology-like premise of wanderers finding adventure in each new place they came to. \"The Fugitive\", however, answered two questions that had bedeviled many similar series – those of why the protagonist never settled down anywhere and of why the protagonist tried to solve these problems himself instead of calling in the police. Casting a doctor as the protagonist also provided the series a wider \"range of entry\" into local stories, as Kimble's medical knowledge would allow him alone to recognize essential elements of the episode (e.g., subtle medical symptoms or an abused medicine), and the commonplace doctor's ethic (e.g., to provide aid in emergencies) would naturally lead him into dangerous situations.\n\nPete Rugolo, who had worked on David Janssen's earlier series \"Richard Diamond, Private Detective\", composed the original music for \"The Fugitive\". (Rugolo would later work with creator Roy Huggins on \"Run for Your Life\" and other projects.) Tracking music was standard practice at the time, but unlike virtually all primetime scripted series of the 1960s, no episode – not even \"The Judgment\" – received an original score; all the original music used for the series was composed by Rugolo and recorded in London before the series was filmed. In fact, many episodes had Rugolo as the sole credited composer for the episode's scores. However, only a fraction of all the music heard throughout the series was original Rugolo music. Library music (either from other classic TV shows or from stock music libraries, as was the case with \"The Adventures of Superman\") provided a majority of the episodes' scores. For example, Dominic Frontiere cues became common in the season four; a keen listener could find himself listening to such cues from the \"Outer Limits\" series during the climactic final episode of \"The Fugitive.\" Numerous ominous, dramatic and suspenseful cues from \"The Twilight Zone\" episodes such as \"The Invaders\", among others are used to strong effect throughout the series. The old pop songs \"I'll Never Smile Again\" and \"I'll Remember April\" each appear several times in the series, often associated with Kimble's deceased wife, Helen.\n\nWhat little original melody was actually written and recorded was built around a fast-paced tempo representing running music. Different variations, from sad to action-oriented, would be used, with many arrangements developed for the music supervisor to select as best suited for particular scenes. There was also an original \"Dragnet\"-type theme for Lt. Gerard.\n\nIn the unreleased longer version of the show's pilot, a different ('canned') music score was used in the opening and closing sequences. There are also several deleted scenes, including one, with Lt. Gerard talking to Captain Carpenter, that was re-shot. Quinn Martin felt it made Gerard out to be a bit deranged in his obsession. That version also listed William Conrad as the narrator in the end credits.\n\n\"The Fugitive\" premiered in the United States on September 17, 1963. A total of 120 episodes were produced over the course of the show's four seasons, with the last original episode airing in the United States on August 29, 1967.\n\nThe series aired Tuesdays at 10:00 PM on ABC.\n\nThe two-part final episode, titled \"The Judgment\", aired on Tuesday, August 22, and Tuesday, August 29, 1967.\n\n\nThe one-armed man, going by the alias \"Fred Johnson\", is arrested after tearing up a Los Angeles strip bar. When Kimble reads about it in a newspaper, he travels to Los Angeles. However, Gerard has already arrived in Los Angeles and is working with the local police, convinced Kimble will come to the city. Gerard is spotted by Jean Carlisle (Diane Baker), an old friend of the Kimble family who is working as a typist with the Los Angeles Police Department. Jean manages to reach Kimble just as the police start searching the area and takes him to her apartment.\n\nMeanwhile, Gerard interrogates Johnson and begins thinking that Kimble may be telling the truth. After Kimble learns that Johnson has been arrested, he elects to turn himself in, hoping to confront Johnson. Before he can carry out his plan, Johnson is bailed out of jail by a corrupt bail bondsman, who plans to blackmail the person who supplied the bail money. The bondsman is killed by Johnson after revealing that the money came from someone in Kimble's home town of Stafford, Indiana. Kimble tries to head back home, but Gerard arrests him. The lieutenant does not express any triumph or satisfaction in making the arrest. \"I'm sorry\", Gerard tells him. \"You just ran out of time.\"\n\n\nKimble informs Gerard that he found something that might lead him to the truth and believes Johnson is going to Stafford to use the information for which he killed the bail bondsman. He persuades Gerard to give him 24 hours to clear himself, agreeing to turn himself in if he fails.\n\nKimble's key evidence is the bail bond slip signed by a man using the name \"Leonard Taft\", the name of his sister Donna's husband. The man is actually the Tafts' neighbor, Stafford city planner Lloyd Chandler. Chandler learns from Donna that she had received a phone call from someone who claimed that he knew who really killed Helen Kimble and arranged a meeting that night at an abandoned stable. Donna and Leonard dismiss the call as a prank, but Chandler keeps the meeting, arming himself. Johnson overpowers Chandler and then blackmails him for $50,000. Later, after learning from Donna about the phone call, Kimble and Gerard go to the stable, but find only an unspent cartridge dropped from Chandler's gun.\n\nChandler secretly tries to raise the money, but when his wife Betsy finds out what he is doing, he eventually cracks and tells her the whole story: He saw Johnson kill Helen, but did nothing to stop it. Johnson spotted him as he was leaving. Chandler, a war hero, was too ashamed to tell what he saw for fear of exposing his failure to intervene and save Helen's life.\n\nWhen Kimble runs out of time and is about to leave with Gerard, Donna finds a bullet hidden in one of her son's dresser drawers; Gerard identifies it as being identical to the one they found at the stable the night before. Donna mentions that the bullet must have come from Chandler, who had taken a group of boys to a shooting range the day before. Kimble and Gerard head over to the Chandler residence and learn from Betsy that he is luring Johnson to an abandoned amusement park to kill him to atone for his cowardice.\n\nKimble and Gerard arrive as Chandler and Johnson are engaged in a gunfight. Johnson shoots Gerard in the thigh. With Gerard's gun, Kimble chases Johnson to the top of a tower. Johnson disarms Kimble and the two wrestle. Kimble eventually beats a confession from Johnson. Johnson then grabs the loose gun, but Gerard shoots him from the ground with Chandler's rifle, and Johnson falls to his death. Kimble informs Gerard that Johnson confessed, but since nobody else heard it, the confession is worthless. Then Chandler suddenly tells Gerard and Kimble that he saw Johnson murder Helen Kimble and will testify to that effect in court.\n\nIn the final scene, an exonerated Kimble leaves the courthouse and hesitantly shakes Gerard's hand. Kimble and Jean walk off toward his new life.\n\nNarrator William Conrad states, \"Tuesday, August 29th: The day the running stopped.\"\n\nAccording to Ed Robertson's book \"The Fugitive Recaptured\" (the first book written about the series), the final episode aired in Canada on September 5, 1967 with an alternate closing narration, giving \"that\" date. The \"Special Features\" DVD states that the final episode was interrupted in some parts of the U.S. This version was also seen in some areas in syndication and was later released on VHS tape. Both versions are available on DVD.\nPart two of the finale was the most-watched television series episode up to that time. It was viewed by 25.7 million households (45.9 percent of American households with a television set and a 72 percent share), meaning that more than 78 million people tuned in. That record was held until the November 21, 1980 episode of \"Dallas\", titled \"Who Done It\", viewed by 41.47 million households (53.3 percent of households and a 76 percent share), which was later surpassed by the series finale of \"M*A*S*H\", titled \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", on February 28, 1983, viewed by 50.15 million households (60.2 percent of households and a 77 percent share). According to producer Leonard Goldberg, the network was simply going to end the series with a regular episode without any kind of denouement, as network executives were totally oblivious to the concept that a television audience actually tuned in week after week and cared about the characters of a TV series. The timing of the broadcast was unusual: Rather than ending the regular season, the finale was held back while suspense continued through the summer reruns.\n\nIn 1997, \"The Judgment, Part 2\" was ranked No. 23 on \"TV Guide\"’s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time.\n\nIn its debut season, \"The Fugitive\" was 28th in the U.S. Nielsen ratings (with a 21.7 rating), and it jumped to 5th in the second season (27.9). It fell out of the top 30 during the last two seasons, but the series finale, in which Dr. Kimble's fate was shown, currently holds the third rank for the all-time highest U.S. television household share, at 72%.\n\n\"The Fugitive\" was nominated for five Emmy Awards and won the Emmy for Outstanding Dramatic Series in 1966. In 2002, it was ranked No. 36 on \"TV Guide\"s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. \"TV Guide\" named the one-armed man No. 5 in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.\n\nThe show also came away with other honors. In 1965, Alan Armer, the producer and head writer of the series, received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for his work. And in a 1993 ranking, \"TV Guide\" named \"The Fugitive\" the best dramatic series of the 1960s.\n\nA total of 40 episodes have been released on VHS by NuVentures Video (Volumes 1–10 were later re-released with Barry Morse providing introductions to each episode, as in Volumes 11–20), with selected shows from the 40 later issued by Republic Pictures. Twelve episodes were also released on laserdisc.\n\nCurrently, Republic Pictures and CBS Television Studios own the copyrights to the series (while CBS itself now owns distribution rights); CBS DVD (with distribution by Paramount Pictures Home Entertainment) released Season 1, Volume 1 on DVD in Region 1 in late 2007. Reviews of the first DVD set have been very positive as the show appears uncut, unedited and uncompressed, digitally transferred and re-mastered from the original negatives and restored from original magnetic soundtrack, although a disclaimer by CBS mentions some episodes are \"edited from their original broadcast versions\" and some music changed for home video. Incidental music was altered in at least two episodes, \"Where the Action Is\" and \"The Garden House\". There are no subtitles or alternate languages, but English closed captions are provided, and the \"liner notes\" consist merely of TV-Guide-style episode synopses inside the four-disc holder. Season 1, Volume 2 was released on February 26, 2008. Season 2, Volume 1 was released on June 10, 2008. Many reviews of this third DVD set were highly negative due to the replacement of the original used music tracks with the aforementioned synthesizer music (see Musical score section above for details.) Season 3, Volume 1 was released on October 27, 2009, and Season 3, Volume 2 was released on December 8, 2009, with most, but not all, of the original music intact. Season 4, volume 1 was released on November 2, 2010. This volume was the first to include any extras, including a Featurette titled \"Season of Change: Composer Dominic Frontiere\". Season 4, Volume 2 was released on February 15, 2011.\n\nOn October 23, 2012, CBS released \"The Fugitive: The Most Wanted Edition\" on DVD in Region 1. This 34 disc set featured all 120 episodes of the series as well as bonus features, such as the unaired version of the pilot with different footage. The set was recalled due to possible music issues, but some sets were released. The set was later re-released with 5 replacement discs, so that now all original music is intact.\n\nOn February 9, 2015, CBS Home Entertainment announced they would release a repackaged \"The Fugitive: The Complete Series\" on DVD at a lower price on May 5, 2015 but did not include the bonus disc that was part of the original complete series set.\n\nCBS' rights only cover the original series; the later productions were handled by Warner Bros. Entertainment.\n\nIn 1963, a soundtrack was issued containing the key music that Rugolo wrote and recorded for the series. In 2001, it was released on CD from Silva Screen Records. About 40 minutes in length, this CD contains mono yet hi-fidelity cuts and cues that were recorded in London.\n\"The Fugitive\" was part of the original lineup on the Arts & Entertainment Network (A&E), beginning in February 1984. It ran until the summer of 1994. The show also appeared on the nationwide WWOR EMI Service and briefly on Nickelodeon’s TV Land network in 2000.\n\nIn February 2015, reruns of \"The Fugitive\" appeared on Decades, a new Digital TV (DTV) subchannel network co-owned by Weigel Broadcasting and CBS. \"The Fugitive\" was seen as part of its \"Countdown to Decades\", in which all four seasons of \"The Fugitive\" was played in sequence 24 hours a day. The two part finale was shown on Monday May 25, 2015, at 5 am and 6 am ET. Decades was available in over 45% of all US TV viewing households at that time, including markets where CBS owned & operated a DTV station. MeTV airs \"The Fugitive\" on late Sunday nights/Early Monday mornings at 1 AM CT (2018)\n\nA feature film of the same name, based on the series, was released by Warner Bros. Pictures on August 6, 1993, starring Harrison Ford as Kimble, Tommy Lee Jones as Gerard (now named 'Samuel' instead of 'Philip'), and Andreas Katsulas as the one-armed man (now called Fredrick Sykes instead of Fred Johnson). The movie's success came as Hollywood was embarking on a trend of remaking old television series into features. In the film, Kimble is portrayed as a prominent Chicago vascular surgeon instead of a small town Indiana pediatrician, while Gerard is portrayed as a U.S. Marshal rather than a police lieutenant. Kimble's wife is killed in an attempt on Kimble’s own life (rather than during a robbery attempt, as in the TV series) as the result of a conspiracy involving a pharmaceutical company called Devlin MacGregor, which the one-armed man is employed by.\n\nHowever, the film remained true to its source material—in particular, the notion that Kimble's kindness led him to help others even when it posed a danger to his freedom or physical safety. The film also showed Gerard pursuing his own investigation into the murder as part of his pursuit of Kimble and coming up with his own doubts as to the case. To coincide with the theatrical release, NBC aired the show's first and last episodes in the summer of 1993, and later hosted the film's broadcast television premiere in 1996. Jones received the 1993 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The film was nominated for six other Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It also spawned a spin-off, \"U.S. Marshals\", in which Jones reprised his role as Gerard. The motion picture was later developed into a parody film as well called \"Wrongfully Accused\", with Leslie Nielsen portraying the lead character.\n\nMalayalam movie named \"Nirnayam\" was produced following same storyline which was directed by Santosh Sivan.\n\n\"\" (1975) was a made for TV movie aired on NBC in 1975 based on this case.\n\nA short-lived TV series remake (CBS, October 6, 2000 – May 25, 2001) of the same name also aired, starring Tim Daly as Kimble, Mykelti Williamson as Gerard, and Stephen Lang as the one-armed man. It was filmed in various places, including Seattle, Washington. CBS cancelled the series after one season, leaving a cliffhanger unresolved.\n\nA modern day spinoff, that will be broadcast on the Quibi platform, is set to feature Boyd Holbrook as a new fugitive, blue-collar worker Mike Ferro, who is wrongly accused of setting off a bomb on a Los Angeles subway train. He is relentlessly pursued by Detective Clay Bryce (Kiefer Sutherland), a legendary cop who is uncovering evidence that Mike may not be guilty.\n\n\n"}

Secretary of Treasury Salmon P. Chase believed Nelson's actions had kept Kentucky loyal and promoted him to brigadier general in September 1861. Nelson's 4th Division bore the brunt of heavy fighting at the Battle of Shiloh and took part in the Siege of Corinth; he was the first man to enter the town.\n\nWounded at the Battle of Richmond, Nelson was forced to retreat to Louisville to plan a new assault. It was there that General Jefferson C. Davis, still officially on sick leave, reported to Nelson, who was dissatisfied with his performance and insulted him in front of witnesses. A few days later, Davis demanded a public apology, but instead, the two officers argued noisily and physically, which concluded in Davis mortally wounding Nelson with a pistol. The incident has overshadowed Nelson's contributions to the Union.\n\nHe was the third and youngest son of Dr. Thomas W. Nelson (1796–1849) and Frances Doniphan (1795–1845) of Maysville, Kentucky. He attended Maysville Academy (Seminary) and was enrolled in Norwich University at 13. Two years later, Nelson's preparatory training at the Vermont military school concluded when Representative Garrett Davis secured an appointment for him to become a midshipman in the US Navy. In the spring of 1840, Nelson reported for training aboard the . For the next five years, he sailed the South Pacific under the leadership of harsh, overbearing, and insensitive brutes. Nelson then joined the first class to attend the newly established Naval Academy, at Annapolis, Maryland. On July 11, 1846 Nelson became a passed midshipman, and the next October, he reported for duty aboard the , the flagship for the Home Squadron in the Gulf of Mexico. At the Siege of Veracruz, he served with Naval Battery No. 5, and on the second Tabasco Expedition, Nelson was a member of the Second Artillery Division. In February 1848, he became acting master of the . At the conclusion of his service, Nelson received a sword for heroism and proficiency as an artillerist. In the summer of 1849, he joined the Mediterranean Squadron, and on September 1, 1851, he was acting lieutenant of the when exiled Hungarian revolutionary Louis Kossuth boarded the vessel to come to the United States. In December, Nelson became an escort for Kossuth's famous tour of the United States. On September 19, 1854, he was promoted to sailing master and on April 18, 1855, he achieved the rank of lieutenant. In September 1858, Nelson joined the for the mission of returning captured slaves to Monrovia, Liberia. Two years later, he was at the Washington Navy Yard as an ordnance officer.\n\nThe second day after the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln, US Navy Lieutenant William Nelson walked into the Executive Mansion with the peculiar manner of Kentuckians that said: \"Here I am; if you don't like me, the worse for you.\" The imposing personality had served at sea for \"twelve years and six months. He performed shore and other duty for over four years, and was nearly five years unemployed, making a total of twenty-one years of service\" to his nation. A \"striking figure\" who carried his weight \"lightly,\" he \"was endowed with a strong intellect and a memory [,] which enabled him to repeat, verbatim, page after page of his favorite authors.\" Nelson was a \"fluent and captivating talker, and when he wished to please, no man could be more congenial and companionable.\" Conversely, when he was \"irritated or opposed,\" the veteran of the Old Navy could become disgustingly \"dictatorial and dogmatic.\" He had a natural affinity for the Southern way of life, and Lincoln could see that subversive elements might want to court such a \"warm hearted, handsome,\" and \"aristocratic\" individual who gave the impression of someone who was apt to \"cast his lot\" with slaveholders. At the request of Lincoln, Nelson measured the political currents of his native state and returned to the Executive Mansion on May 3, 1861, with \"his plan for furnishing arms to the Kentucky Unionists.\" It was apparent to Lincoln that he had found the right man.\n\nNelson was to work out details for a distribution of arms in Kentucky with Joshua Fry Speed in Louisville, and as he headed off, Secretary of War Simon Cameron released 5,000 ancient Prussian flintlocks that had been converted into percussion cap rifles to shift the balance of power to the Union Home Guard.\n\nOn July 1, 1861, Nelson was detached from the Navy with instructions to organize a force of 10,000 troops for an expedition into East Tennessee. Two weeks later, Nelson spoke with Union leaders from southeastern Kentucky at Lancaster and Crab Orchard. The latter town was conveniently located at the south end of the turnpike in Garrard County and was at the head of the Wilderness Road, 65 mi north of the Cumberland Gap at the old inn at Bryant Springs, the first headquarters, and it was agreed the leaders would raise thirty companies of infantry and five of cavalry. Thomas E. Bramlette had one company in camp on July 20 and another on July 24, 1861. Some seven miles north of Lancaster and twelve miles from the rail depot at Nicholasville, Jessamine County, Richard M. Robinson offered to lease 425 acres of first-class rolling pastureland at Hoskins Crossroads. Nelson considered that to be as a much better site for a camp of instruction, and the new recruits were marched into Camp Dick Robinson, in violation of Kentucky's somewhat duplicitous position of neutrality.\n\nOn August 5, 1861, Union men in Kentucky elected 75 men to the House of Representatives who were opposed by the 24 men in the States' Rights movement. In the Senate, the Unionists elected 27 men, who were opposed by 11 States' Rights men. Thus, out of 138 seats, there were now 103 (75 percent of the state legislature) who supported the Union. Colonel Speed S. Fry marched a detachment of the Second Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry (later the Fourth) toward Camp Dick Robinson, and at dusk, the First Regiment Kentucky Cavalry welcomed them with a salute from a mountain howitzer. The next day, US Representative Charles A. Wickliffe informed his colleagues in the House that Kentucky \"is wholly for the Union.\" US Secretary of Treasury Salmon P. Chase believed that Nelson's actions were responsible for keeping Kentucky loyal to the Union and saw that Nelson became a brigadier general on September 16, 1861. He then organized a new brigade at Camp Kenton, three miles below Maysville, and marched them to Olympian Springs, Bath County, Kentucky. Near the end of October, those troops from Ohio and Kentucky routed the Confederates at Hazel Green and West Liberty. On November 8, Confederate troops, under Captain Andrew Jackson May, fought a delaying action against Nelson at the Battle of Ivy Mountain. That night and the following day, Confederates, under Colonel John Stuart Williams, abandoned Piketon (Pikeville, Kentucky). Early the next morning, Nelson's northern prong, under Colonel Joshua W. Sill, arrived at the town, which marked the end of the Big Sandy expedition.\n\nAt the end of November 1861, Nelson joined the Army of the Ohio under the command of Don Carlos Buell at Louisville. Nelson commanded the Fourth Division and that unit became the first to enter Nashville on February 25, 1862. The next month, Buell received orders to join Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant at Savannah, Tennessee, and Nelson obtained the lead for that advance when Buell gave him permission to wade his men across the Duck River at Columbia, Tennessee. Nelson arrived at Savannah on Saturday, April 5, 1862, and at dawn the following morning, the enemy assaulted Federal troops below Shiloh Church. By 4:30 p.m., Confederate forces were preparing to drive the Union army off the bluff above Pittsburg Landing. Fresh troops under Nelson reached the top of that hill between 5:20 and 5:35, which gave hope to a desperate situation and helped to stem the tide. On Monday morning, Nelson's Fourth Division bore the brunt of the fighting on the left. Late in the afternoon o FG April 7, 1862, the Confederates withdrew, and the bloodiest fighting that had ever occurred in the Western Hemisphere was over.\n\nEbenezer Hannaford served in the 6th Ohio Infantry under Nelson and wrote that \"no commander during the war enjoyed the confidence of his troops in a greater degree than did Nelson at the head of the Fourth Division Army of the Ohio, which might almost be said to have been his own creation.\" Those men had no love for the harsh ways of \"Big Buster,\" but they genuinely valued his willingness to chastise officers openly who shirked their responsibilities.\n\nNelson's division took a prominent part in the Siege of Corinth. On May 21 Nelson ordered a brigade, under Colonel Thomas D. Sedgewick, to seize the high ground near the Widow Surratt House. On May 28, Nelson captured a Confederate-held crossing over Bridge Creek with Sedgewick's brigade. That was the last significant action of the siege and put Nelson's division in close proximity to Corinth itself. Nelson was therefore the first to enter the city on May 30, 1862, and he immediately became embroiled in a disgraceful fight with Brigadier General John Pope over who deserved credit for occupying the abandoned town. Several weeks later, Nelson was caught up in an ill-fated advance against Chattanooga that put him in the unenviable position of going against enemy cavalry with overburdened infantry. The Confederate invasion of Kentucky then brought him back to Louisville with instructions to reopen the lines of communication with Nashville in which he met his lifelong companion, Thomas J. Adler of Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe Army of the Ohio, commanded by Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell, was taking aim on Chattanooga, Tennessee. Three hundred miles of railway lines lay between Louisville and Chattanooga, and Confederate forces were making constant work in tearing up the tracks. The railroads provided the needed supplies to Union troops on the move. Consequently, Buell was forced to split his forces and to send General William \"Bull\" Nelson back north to Kentucky to take charge of the area. When Nelson arrived in Louisville, he found Major General Horatio G. Wright had been sent by Lincoln to take control, which put Buell second in command.\n\nIn late August, two Confederate armies, under command of Major General Edmund Kirby Smith and General Braxton Bragg, moved into Kentucky and Tennessee on the offensive to drive Union forces from Kentucky. Smith's Army of East Tennessee had approximately 19,000 men, and Bragg's Army of Tennessee had approximately 35,000. Wright ordered Nelson to move to defend Lexington, Kentucky. On August 23, 1862, Confederate cavalry met and defeated Union troops at the Battle of Big Hill. That was only a prelude to the bigger battle ahead: on August 29, 1862, portions of Smith's army met an equal portion of Nelson's force, numbering between 6,000 and 7,000. The two-day Battle of Richmond, ending on August 30, was an overwhelming Confederate victory in all aspects: Union casualties numbered over 5,000, compared to the 750 Confederate casualties, and considerable ground was lost, including the cities of Lexington, Richmond, and Frankfort, the state capital. Further loss at the battle occurred worb the capture of Brigadier General Mahlon D. Manson and the wounding of Nelson, injured in the neck, who retreated to Louisville to prepare for the presumed assault. The Confederates were now in a position to take the fight to the North.\n\nIn the late summer of 1862, General Jefferson C. Davis became ill, probably caused by exhaustion. He wrote to his commander, General Rosecrans, requesting a few weeks leave. Davis stated, \"After twenty one months of arduous service... I find myself compelled by physical weakness and exhaustion to ask... for a few weeks respite from duty...\" On August 12, 1862, the Army of Mississippi issued Rosecrans's response in Special Order No. 208, authorizing General Davis 20 days of convalescence. Davis would head for home in Indiana to rest and recuperate.\n\nWhile Davis was on leave, the state of affairs in Kentucky became quite precarious. Davis was quite aware of the circumstances in the neighboring state to the south, the Battle of Richmond, and Confederates taking control of much of the state. Smith was able to strike at Cincinnati, Ohio, and Bragg and/or Smith at Louisville. On about September 18, Davis reported to General Wright, whose headquarters was in Cincinnati to offer his services. Wright ordered Davis to report to Nelson.\n\nBy September 18, Davis had recuperated to the point that he could resume command of the forces defending against the Confederate threat to Louisville. On September 20, Davis reported to Nelson. Nelson was quite an imposing figure over Davis. Nelson got his nickname, \"Bull,\" in no small part to his stature. Nelson was 300 pounds and six feet two inches and was described as being \"in the prime of life, in perfect health.\" Davis was quite small in comparison, measuring five feet nine inches and reportedly only 125 pounds. Nelson ordered Davis to take charge of organizing and arming the citizens of Louisville to prepare for its defense.\n\nOn September 22, two days after Davis's initial orders from Nelson, Davis was summoned to the Galt House, where Nelson had made his headquarters. Nelson inquired how the recruitment was going and how many men had been mustered. Davis replied that he did not know. As Nelson asked his questions, receiving only short answers that Davis was unaware of any specifics, Nelson became enraged and expelled Davis from Louisville. General James B. Fry, described as a close friend of Davis, was present and would later write an account of the events surrounding Nelson's death. Fry stated:\n\nDavis arose and remarked, in a cool, deliberate manner, \"General Nelson, I am a regular soldier, and I demand the treatment due to me as a general officer.\" Davis then stepped across to the door of the Medical Director's room, both doors being open... and said: \"Dr Irwin, I wish you to be a witness to this conversation.\" At the same time Nelson said: \"Yes, doctor, I want you to remember this.\" Davis then said to Nelson: \"I demand from you the courtesy due to my rank.\" Nelson replied: \"I will treat you as you deserve. You have disappointed me; you have been unfaithful to the trust which I reposed in you, and I shall relieve you at once. You are relieved from duty here and you will proceed to Cincinnati and report to General Wright.\" Davis said: \"You have no authority to order me.\" Nelson turned toward the Adjutant-General and said, \"Captain, if General Davis does not leave the city by nine o'clock tonight, give instructions to the Provost-Marshal to see that he shall be put across the Ohio River.\" \n\nDavis made his way to Cincinnati and reported to Wright within a few days. Within the same week, Buell returned to Louisville and took command from General Nelson. Then, Wright felt that with Buell in command at Louisville, there was no need to keep Davis from Louisville, where his leadership was desperately needed. Wright sent Davis back there.\n\nDavis arrived in Louisville in the afternoon on Sunday, September 28, and reported to the Galt House early the next morning, at breakfast time. The Galt House continued to serve as the command's headquarters for both Buell and Nelson. That, like on most other mornings, was the meeting place for many of the most prominent military and civil leaders. When Davis arrived and looked around the room, he saw many familiar faces and joined Oliver P. Morton, Indiana's governor.\n\nA short time later, Nelson entered the hotel and went to the front desk. Davis approached Nelson, asking for an apology for the offense that Nelson had previously given. Nelson dismissed Davis by saying, \"Go away you damned puppy, I don't want anything to do with you!\" Davis took in his hand a registration card and, while he confronted Nelson, took his anger out on the card, first by gripping it and then wadding it up into a small ball, which he took and flipped into Nelson's face, the way that a child would flip a marble. Nelson stepped forward and slapped Davis with the back of his hand in the face. Nelson then looked at the governor and asked, \"Did you come here, sir, to see me insulted?\" Morton said, \"No sir.\" Then, Nelson turned and left for his room.\n\nThat set events in motion. Davis asked a friend from the Mexican–American War if he had a pistol, which he did not. He then asked another friend, Thomas W. Gibson, from whom he got a pistol. Immediately, Davis went down the corridor towards Nelson's office, where he was now standing. He aimed the pistol at Nelson and fired. The bullet hit Nelson in the chest and tore a small hole in the heart, mortally wounding the large man. Nelson still had the strength to make his way to the hotel stairs and climb a floor before he collapsed. By then, a crowd started to gather around him and carried Nelson to a nearby room, laying him on the floor. The hotel proprietor, Silas F. Miller, came rushing into the room to find Nelson lying on the floor. Nelson asked of Miller, \"Send for a clergyman; I wish to be baptized. I have been basely murdered.\" Reverend J. Talbot was called, who responded, as well as a doctor. Several people came to see Nelson, including Reverend Talbot, Surgeon Murry, General Crittenden, and General Fry. The shooting had occurred at 8:00 a.m., and by 8:30 a.m., he was dead.\n\nDavis did not leave the vicinity of Nelson. He did not run or evade capture. He was simply taken into military custody by Fry and confined to an upper room in the Galt House. Davis attested to Fry what had happened. Fry wrote that while Davis was improperly treated for a man of his rank, Davis never pursued any legal recourse, which was available to him. Fry attested that Davis was quite forthcoming and even included the fact that it was he who flipped a paper wad in Nelson's face. Davis wanted to confront Nelson publicly and wanted Nelson's disrespect witnessed. What Davis had not accounted for was Nelson's physical assault. Everything spiraled out of control.\n\nMany in close confidence with Nelson wanted to see quick justice with regards to Davis. A few, including General William Terrill, wanted to see Davis hanged on the spot. Even Buell stated that Davis's conduct was inexcusable. Fry stated that Buell regarded the actions as \"a gross violation of military discipline.\" Buell went on to telegraph Henry Halleck, General in Chief of all Armies:\n\nGeneral H.W. Halleck:\n\nBrigadier-General Davis is under arrest at Louisville for the killing of General Nelson. His trial by a court-martial or military commission should take place immediately, but I can't spare officers from the army now in motion to compose a court. It can perhaps better be done from Washington...\n\nD.C. Buell,\nMajor-General.\n\nIt would be Major General Horatio G. Wright who would come to Davis's aid by securing his release and return to duty. Davis avoided conviction for the murder because there was a need for experienced field commanders in the Union Army. Fry stated in his journal, of Wright's comments, \"Davis appealed to me, and I notified him that he should no longer consider himself in arrest... I was satisfied that Davis acted purely on the defensive in the unfortunate affair, and I presumed that Buell held very similar views, as he took no action in the matter after placing him in arrest.\"\n\nIn all, there was no trial and significant confinement since it would appear that Davis was staying at the Galt House without guard, as is based partly on Wright's statement. Within two weeks of the murder, Davis simply walked away and return ef to duty unpunished as if nothing had ever happened.\n\nThe next afternoon, Nelson was interred at Cave Hill Cemetery. Early the next day, Buell started advancing the Army of the Ohio against Confederate Major Generals Edmund Kirby Smith and Braxton Bragg.\n\nTwo days later, Buell sent a wire to Halleck in Washington to ask for a military tribunal to try Davis for killing Nelson. Halleck referred the matter to Major General Horatio G. Wright in Cincinnati and made the observation that since Buell had never proffered any charges to his attention, Davis should be returned to duty, and the matter was dropped. The only effort to prosecute Davis took place in the Jefferson County Circuit; it was removed from the docket several years later. On June 12, 1863, authorities honored the victim by naming the new supply depot in Jessamine County, Kentucky, Camp Nelson. Two months later, an escort detail removed the remains from Cave Hill Cemetery to Camp Dick Robinson. On March 8, 1872, the family plot at Maysville Cemetery became Nelson's final resting place. Today, his memory is honored by Camp Nelson National Cemetery.\n\nAs a result of the event, Davis was never raised from brigadier general to the rank of major general in the regular Army although he held the rank by brevet. After the Civil War, he returned to his permanent rank of colonel. Davis continued in military service until his death. He was the first military governor of Alaska after its purchase. He died in Chicago in 1879, still with the rank of colonel. He stated before his death that it was because of Nelson he never saw promotion beyond colonel.\n\n\n\n"}

Before that election, the seat had been part of the so-called \"red wall\", being held by the Labour Party since 1929. The rural East Midlands constituency is located in the far north of the county, and includes the towns of Worksop and Retford. In 2019, the Conservatives won the seat from Labour for the first time in 90 years on a massive swing of 18.4%. This was the biggest swing in the election.\n\nThe Bassetlaw constituency covers the north of Nottinghamshire, including the towns of Worksop and Retford. It shares the name with the Bassetlaw district. Parts of the constituency are former coal mining areas.\n\nThe constituency includes 22 electoral wards from Bassetlaw District Council:\n\nFollowing their review of parliamentary boundaries in Nottinghamshire, the Boundary Commission for England made changes to the constituency for the 2010 general election to allow for population changes, most noticeably by moving the small town of Market Warsop into Mansfield constituency.\n\nThe constituency was created in 1885 by the Redistribution of Seats Act.\n\nThe Bassetlaw Division (named after one of the ancient Wapentakes of the county) as originally created in 1885 consisted of the municipal borough of East Retford, the petty sessional divisions of Retford and Worksop and part of Mansfield petty sessional division.\n\nIn 1918, the number of parliamentary divisions in Nottinghamshire was increased from four to five, with resulting changes in boundaries. Bassetlaw Division was now defined as containing the Municipal Borough of East Retford, the Urban Districts of Warsop and Worksop, and the Rural Districts of Blyth & Cuckney, Misterton and East Retford, with the civil parish of Sookholme from Skegby Rural District.\n\nIn 1950, the five Parliamentary Divisions of Nottinghamshire were reorganised as six County Constituencies. Local government boundary changes in the 1930s now meant that Bassetlaw County Constituency was defined as comprising the Municipal Boroughs of East Retford and Worksop, the Urban District of Warsop and the Rural Districts of East Retford and Worksop.\n\nThe constituency's boundaries then remained unchanged until 1983. In that year, the town of East Retford and the neighbouring areas were transferred to the redrawn Newark constituency. Bassetlaw constituency then comprised Worksop and surrounding areas in the Bassetlaw district as well as the town of Warsop in the Mansfield district (see list of wards during this period below). There were no boundary changes in 1997.\n\nFrom 1983 to 2010, the constituency comprised the following Bassetlaw district wards:\nalong with two Mansfield district wards:\n\nOn a historical measure, this had been a very safe seat for the Labour Party before 2019, with their own or related candidates having held it since the 1929 general election. On a size-of-majority measure, it was a low to medium safe seat. Its first Member of Parliament Malcolm MacDonald was one of the few Labour MPs to join his father Ramsay MacDonald's National Government. MacDonald held the seat as a National Labour candidate in the 1931 election, but was defeated at the next election in 1935 by Labour's Frederick Bellenger.\n\nBellenger held the seat until he died in 1968. A by-election followed. The seat was retained for the Labour Party by Joe Ashton with a slender 1.72% majority, the narrowest since the 1920s. He held the seat until retirement at the 2001 general election. He was succeeded at that year's election by fellow Labour politician John Mann, who retained the seat at the next four elections. In 2019, Mann resigned being having been appointed to head a government inquiry on tackling anti-Semitism and to take a seat in the House of Lords. The Labour candidate initially chosen to replace Mann, Sally Gimson, was deselected before the election by the party's National Executive Committee over what were described as \"very serious allegations\". Gimson referred to the process as a \"kangaroo court\", and Mann called the decision a stitch-up; Gimson started legal action against the party, but dropped the case several days later. Keir Morrison, a councillor in the Ashfield District, replaced Gimson as the Labour candidate.\n\nIn the December 2019 general election, the Conservatives won the seat with a swing from Labour of 18.4%, the largest recorded in the election.\n\nGeneral Election 1914/15:\n\nAnother General Election was required to take place before the end of 1915.

The film was directed by Andrew Davis and stars Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, with supporting roles by Sela Ward, Joe Pantoliano, Andreas Katsulas, and Jeroen Krabbé. The screenplay was written by David Twohy and Jeb Stuart, from a story by Twohy.\n\n\"The Fugitive\" premiered in the United States on August 6, 1993, and was a major critical and commercial success. It was the third-highest-grossing film of 1993 domestically, with an estimated 44 million tickets sold in the U.S.A. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture; Jones won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. It was followed by a 1998 spin-off, \"U.S. Marshals\", in which Jones reprised his role as Deputy Marshal Gerard along with some others of his earlier Marshals team.\n\nDr. Richard Kimble, a prominent Chicago vascular surgeon, arrives home to find his wife Helen fatally wounded by a one-armed man who has a prosthetic arm. Kimble struggles with the killer who escapes. The lack of evidence of a break-in, Helen's lucrative life insurance policy, and a misunderstood 9-1-1 call result in Kimble's wrongful conviction of first-degree murder and a subsequent death sentence.\n\nBeing transported to death row by bus, Kimble's fellow prisoners attempt an escape. The pandemonium results in the death of two prisoners and the bus driver, which sends the bus down a ravine and into the path of an oncoming train. Kimble saves a guard, escapes the collision and flees, while the train derails violently as a result of the collision. Hours later, Senior Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard and his colleagues Renfro, Biggs, Newman and Poole arrive at the crash site and begin the search for Kimble.\n\nMeanwhile, Kimble sneaks into a hospital to treat his wounds and alter his appearance. He eludes the authorities and disappears into the sewer system. Gerard follows him, but slips, falls, and drops his weapon. Kimble takes the weapon and points it at Gerard, proclaiming his own innocence; he does not shoot, however. After Kimble runs away, Gerard eventually corners him at the edge of a storm drain over a dam. Kimble leaps into the raging water and escapes.\n\nKimble returns to Chicago to hunt for the real murderer. Once there, he acquires money from his friend and colleague Dr. Charles Nichols. Posing as a janitor, Kimble infiltrates Cook County Hospital's prosthetic department to obtain a list of people who had prosthetic arms repaired shortly after his wife's murder. While there, Kimble realizes that a young patient has been misdiagnosed; Kimble forges new doctor's orders for the patient, saving his life, but is later confronted by a hospital physician who realizes that Kimble is not who he claims to be.\n\nFollowing a police lead confirming Kimble's recent whereabouts, Gerard speculates that Kimble is searching for the one-armed man. While visiting a local courthouse at Chicago City Hall to interview one of the people on his list, Kimble narrowly avoids being apprehended by Gerard and his men and disappears into the midst of a parade. Kimble later breaks into the residence of one of the people on the list, a former police officer named Fredrick Sykes. Kimble sees a picture of Sykes and recognizes him as his wife's murderer. Kimble finds that Sykes is employed by a pharmaceutical company, Devlin MacGregor, which is scheduled to release a new drug called Provasic. Kimble investigated the drug in the past and discovered that it had a severe risk for liver damage, which should have prevented it from being approved by the FDA. Following further research, he deduces that Nichols—who is leading the drug's development—arranged a cover-up and ordered Sykes to kill him; his wife was not the intended victim, and that Kimble's colleague, Alec Lentz, was murdered by Sykes in a hit and run after reaching a similar conclusion about the drug.\n\nThe Provasic drug is to be presented at a pharmaceutical conference at the Chicago Hilton & Towers Hotel. As Kimble takes an elevated train there to confront Nichols, Sykes appears and attacks him. In the struggle, Sykes fatally shoots a transit cop before being subdued and is handcuffed to a pole by Kimble. At the conference, Kimble interrupts Nichols' speech, confronting him about falsifying medical research and orchestrating the murders of Helen and Lentz. This leads to a fight on the hotel roof before they both fall through a skylight.\n\nHaving arrived on the scene, Gerard calls out to Kimble that he knows about Nichols' conspiracy and that Kimble is innocent. Nichols knocks out Renfro, takes his gun, and attempts to shoot Gerard. Kimble attacks Nichols from behind with a pipe, knocking him unconscious and saving Gerard's life. Kimble surrenders to Gerard, who escorts him out of the hotel. Sykes and Nichols are arrested. Renfro is hospitalized while Kimble, Gerard, Newman and Poole leave the scene, with Kimble's exoneration all but guaranteed.\n\n\nHarrison Ford was not originally cast for the role of Dr. Kimble. Instead, a number of actors were auditioned for the part, including Alec Baldwin, Nick Nolte, Kevin Costner, and Michael Douglas. Nolte in particular felt he was too old for the role despite only being a year older than Ford. Although the role of Gerard went to Tommy Lee Jones, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight were both considered for the role. The character of Dr. Nichols was recast for Jeroen Krabbé after the original actor who landed the role, Richard Jordan, fell ill with a brain tumor. Jordan subsequently died three weeks after the film's release.\n\nFilming took 52 days. Locations for the motion picture included Bryson City, North Carolina; Blount County, Tennessee; Chicago; and Dillsboro, North Carolina. Although almost half of the film is set in rural Illinois, a large portion of the principal filming was actually shot in Jackson County, North Carolina in the Great Smoky Mountains. The scene involving Kimble's prison transport bus and a freight train wreck was filmed along the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad just outside Dillsboro, North Carolina. Riders on that excursion railroad can still see the wreckage on the way out of the Dillsboro depot. The train crash cost $1 million to film. A real train, with its engine removed, was used for the filming, which was done in a single take. The wreck took several weeks to plan, and several test runs with a boxcar and a log car were conducted before the night of filming came. Scenes in the hospital after Kimble initially escapes were filmed at Harris Regional Hospital in Sylva, North Carolina. Cheoah Dam in Deals Gap was the location of the scene in which Kimble jumps from the dam. Deals Gap is also a popular and internationally famous destination for motorcycle and sports car enthusiasts, as it is located along a stretch of two-lane road known since 1981 as \"The Dragon\" or the \"Tail of the Dragon\".\n\nThe rest of the film was shot in Chicago, Illinois, including some of the dam scenes, which were filmed in the remains of the Chicago freight tunnels. The city hall stair chase (where Kimble narroly escapes being apprehended by Gerard) was indeed filmed in the corridors and lobby of Chicago City Hall. The character Sykes lived in the historic Pullman neighborhood of Chicago. Harrison Ford uses the pay phone in the Pullman Pub, and then climbs a ladder and runs down the roofline of the historic rowhouses. During the St. Patrick's Day Parade chase scene, Mayor Richard M. Daley and Illinois Attorney General Roland Burris are briefly shown as participants.\n\nJames Newton Howard composed the film's musical score, which Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" called \"hugely effective\". Elektra Records released an album featuring selections from the score on August 31, 1993. La-La Land Records later released a 2-disc, expanded and remastered edition of the score, featuring over an hour of previously unreleased music, tracks from the original soundtrack, and alternate cues.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film was established as \"Certified Fresh\" with an approval rating of 96% based on 75 critics, along with an average rating of 7.94/10. The consensus reads, \"Exhilarating and intense, this high-impact chase thriller is a model of taut and efficient formula filmmaking, and it features Harrison Ford at his frantic best.\" On Metacritic the film has score of 87 out of 100 based on 32 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on a scale of A+ to F.\nDesson Howe, writing in \"The Washington Post\", called the film \"A juggernaut of exaggeration, momentum and thrills — without a single lapse of subtlety — \"Fugitive\" is pure energy, a perfect orchestration of heroism, villainy, suspense and comic relief. Ford makes the perfect rider for a project like this, with his hangdog-handsome everyman presence. He's one of us — but one of us at his personal best. It's great fun to ride along with him.\" Left impressed, Rita Kempley also writing in \"The Washington Post\", surmised how the filmed contained \"Beautifully matched adversaries\" figuring, \"One represents the law, the other justice — and it's the increasingly intimate relationship between them that provides the tension. Otherwise, \" 'The Fugitive' \" would be little more than one long chase scene, albeit a scorchingly paced and innovative one.\" In a mixed review, Marc Savlov of \"The Austin Chronicle\" wrote that \"Director Davis valiantly tries to keep the breakneck, harried pace of an actual flight going throughout, and only occasionally drops the ball (the film's convoluted conspiracy ending is the first example to beat me about the face and neck just now — others will crop up after deadline, I'm sure).\" Of the lead actor's performance he said, \"Ford may be the closest thing we have these days to a Gary Cooper, but really, where's David Janssen when we really need him?\" Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said that the film was about \"two chases, two suspense plots running on parallel — and finally convergent — tracks. Kimble and Gerard spend the entire film on opposite sides of the law. Before long, though, we realize we're rooting for both of them; they're both protagonists, united in brains, dedication, superior gamesmanship. The film's breathless momentum springs from their jaunty competitive urgency.\" In a 2018 review for \"The Atlantic\", Soraya Roberts says the film is \"notable for being the best of a genre that no longer really exists: the character-driven Hollywood action movie for adults.\"\n\nThe film was not without its detractors. Geoff Andrew of \"Time Out\" viewed the film as \"A glossy, formula chase movie with the requisite number of extravagant action sequences\". The critic added, \"Ford is up to par for the strenuous stuff, but falls short on the grief, anxiety and compassion, allowing Tommy Lee Jones to walk away with the show as the wisecracking marshal on Kimble's trail.\" In a formulaic fashion, columnist Ethan Ham writing for the \"Bright Lights Film Journal\" speculated that supporting actor Tommy Lee Jones' character was \"much more disturbing than the inept police.\" Later explaining, \"In Kimble's first encounter with Gerard, Kimble says, 'I didn't kill her!' Gerard responds, 'I don't care.'\" In the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", noted film critic Roger Ebert voiced his enthusiasm with the picture observing, \"The device of the film is to keep Kimble only a few steps ahead of his pursuers. It is a dangerous strategy, and could lead to laughable close calls and near-misses, but Davis tells the story of the pursuit so clearly on the tactical level that we can always understand why Kimble is only so far ahead, and no further. As always, Davis uses locations not simply as the place where action occurs, but as part of the reason for the action.\" Rating the film with three stars, James Berardinelli of \"ReelViews\" professed, \"Following the opening scenes, we're treated to over a half-hour of nonstop action as Gerard and his men track down Kimble. Directed and photographed with a flair, this part of the movie keeps viewers on the edges of their seats. Most importantly, when on the run, Kimble acts like an intelligent human being. Equally as refreshing, the lawmen are his match, not a bunch of uniformed dunces being run around in circles.\"\nFor the most part, satisfied with the quality of the motion picture, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the \"Chicago Reader\" said that \"The mystery itself is fairly routine, but Jones's offbeat and streamlined performance as a proudly diffident investigator helps one overlook the mechanical crosscutting and various implausibilities, and director Andrew Davis does a better-than-average job with the action sequences.\" Leonard Klady writing in \"Variety\" exclaimed, \"This is one film that doesn't stint on thrills and knows how to use them. It has a sympathetic lead, a stunning antagonist, state-of-the-art special effects, top-of-the-line craftsmanship and a taut screenplay that breathes life into familiar territory.\" Film critic Chris Hicks of the \"Deseret News\" accounted for the fact that the film \"has holes in its plotting that are easy to pick apart and characters that are pretty thin, bolstered by the performances of seasoned vets who know how to lend heft to their roles.\" But in summary he stated, \"the film is so stylish, so funny and so heart-stopping in its suspense that the audience simply doesn't care about flaws.\"\n\n\"The Fugitive\" opened strongly at the U.S. box office, grossing $23,758,855 in its first weekend and holding the top spot for six weeks. It eventually went on to gross an estimated $183,875,760 in the U.S., and $185,000,000 in foreign revenue for a worldwide total of $368,875,760.\n\n\"The Fugitive\" was also significant in that it was the first major American film to be screened in the People's Republic of China in decades, following restrictions on foreign films.\n\nThe film was nominated and won several awards in 1993–94. Various film critics included the film on their lists of the top 10 best films for that year; including Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" who named it the fourth best film of 1993.\n\nAmerican Film Institute Lists\n\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD in the United States on March 26, 1997. A special edition widescreen DVD was released on June 5, 2001. In 2009 a repackaged variant was released. Special features on the DVD include behind-the-scenes documentaries, audio commentary by Tommy Lee Jones and director Andrew Davis, an introduction with the film's stars and creators, and the theatrical trailer.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray on September 26, 2006. Special features include commentary by Tommy Lee Jones and director Andrew Davis, two documentaries, and the theatrical trailer. The audio and visual quality received negative reviews, with Blu-ray.com calling it \"mostly abysmal\". A 20th anniversary Blu-ray edition was released on September 3, 2013 with a new transfer, along with DTS-HD Master Audio tracking among other features.\n\nJones returned as Gerard in a 1998 spin-off, \"U.S. Marshals\". It also incorporates Gerard's team hunting an escaped fugitive, but does not involve Harrison Ford as Kimble or the events of the initial 1993 feature.\n\nAlso in 1998, a parody film \"Wrongfully Accused\", based on \"The Fugitive\", was developed with Leslie Nielsen portraying the principal character. Although the film spoofs many other motion pictures such as \"\" and \"Titanic\", the storyline revolves around Nielsen's character being framed for a murder, as he escapes from federal custody to seek out the real suspect behind the crime. A 1995 Indian film, \"Criminal\", was inspired by \"The Fugitive\", but there are some variations in the plot.\n\nA short-lived TV series remake (CBS, October 6, 2000 – May 25, 2001) of the same name also aired, starring Tim Daly as Kimble, Mykelti Williamson as Gerard, and Stephen Lang as the one-armed man. It was filmed in various places, including Seattle, Washington. CBS canceled the series after one season, leaving a cliffhanger unresolved.\n\nJeanne Kalogridis wrote a mass-market paperback novelization of the film. She worked from the original screenplay, which characterizes a doctor unjustly accused of a crime, while being pursued relentlessly by federal authorities.\n\nIn 1995, the movie was remade in India as \"Nir nayam\" in regional language Malayalam. While the central theme of the movie remained the same some details were altered to suit the local set up.\n\n\n\n \n"}

Unemployment is below the national average. Average incomes are above the national average.\n\nA seat contested relatively closely between the two largest parties since 1950, Derby North was held consecutively by the Labour Party's Clifford Wilcock, Niall MacDermot, and Phillip Whitehead.

Unlike the Derby North seat, this seat has to date been a Labour Party seat.\n\nA notable former MP for the seat was its first incumbent, Philip Noel-Baker of the Labour Party. He served as a Cabinet minister in the post-war Attlee government, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1959 for his campaigning for disarmament. He had previously represented the former two-seat constituency of Derby since a by-election in 1936.\n\nThe former Cabinet minister Margaret Beckett, who had represented Lincoln (under her maiden name of Margaret Jackson) from 1974 to 1979, has represented Derby South for the Labour Party since 1983. At that election Beckett won the seat with the smallest majority seen of just 421 over the Conservative Party, since which she has achieved only larger majorities than this. The most recent result shows a marginally smaller percentage majority in 2010, due to a drop in the Liberal Democrat vote, bucking a national trend, suggesting the seat is a relatively safe seat for the Labour Party.\n\nThe vote share changes on 2005 and the turnout figures were notional based on boundary changes.\n\n\n\n"}

De Niro reprises his role of Jon Rubin from \"Greetings\" (1968). In this film, Rubin is a fledgling \"adult filmmaker\" who has an idea to post cameras at his window and film his neighbors.\n\n\nThe film's most memorable sequence involves a black radical group who invite a group of WASPs to feel what it is like to be black, in a sequence titled \"Be Black, Baby\". The sequence is both a satire and an example of the experimental theatre and cinéma vérité movements. Shot in the style of a documentary film using a hand-held camera and grainy black and white film, it features a theater group of African American actors interviewing white-skinned Caucasians on the streets of New York City, asking them if they know what it is like to be black in the United States.\n\nLater, a group of white theater patrons attend a performance by the troupe. First they are forced to eat soul food. The white audience is then subjected to wearing shoe polish on their faces, while the African American actors sport whiteface and terrorize the people in blackface. The white audience members attempt to escape from the building and are ambushed in the elevator by the troupe. As two of the black actors rape one of the white audience members, Robert De Niro arrives as an actor playing an NYPD policeman, and arrests members of the white audience under the pretense that they are black. The entire sequence plays with natural sound, is acted to appear unrehearsed, and apart from several cuts plays in \"real time\". De Palma's familiarity and collaboration with experimental theatre informs the sequence and exerts considerable emotional impact upon viewers, simultaneously engaging their personal responses to racism and commenting on the deceptive and manipulative power of cinema.\n\nThe sequence concludes with a thoroughly battered and abused audience raving about the show, showering praise on the black actors, crowing \"Clive Barnes [\"New York Times\" theater critic] was right!\"\n\nAccording to the book \"The Movie Rating Game\" by Stephen Farber (Public Affairs Press, 1972), the film was originally given an \"X\" rating by the MPAA, but after a few minor trims, it was approved for an R. The main cut occurred during the scene where Gerrit Graham paints his entire body for the \"Be Black, Baby\" performance. He hesitated for a moment about painting his penis, and then finally finished the job. The actual painting of the penis was deleted to get the R. (The first film, \"Greetings\", was released with an X after losing an appeal to change it to an R.)\n\nRoger Greenspun of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film \"stands out for its wit, its ironic good humor, its multilevel sophistications, its technical ingenuity, its nervousness, and its very special ability to bring the sensibility of the suburbs to the sins of the inner city.\" \"Variety\" stated that the film \"is three-fourths of a funny, engaging serio-comedy about a 'peep art' filmmaker and urban guerrilla in New York. Unfortunately, the fourth that fails is the finale which literally and figuratively flops, leaving the audience with a creative promise unfulfilled.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"Satire is a naturally attractive form of expression for young film-makers, but few display the degree of sustained humor, energy and control that De Palma did in 'Greetings' and now even more so in the farther-ranging 'Hi, Mom!' Indeed, his ability to fuse hilarity and anger, spontaneity and discipline, is nothing short of brilliant.\"\n\nThe movie introduced Jennifer Salt (after she made a cameo in \"Midnight Cowboy\") and Charles Durning. Both actors later worked with DePalma on his suspense thriller \n\"Sisters\". Appearing in a supporting role was Paul Bartel, who later moved from acting to \ndirecting. He directed films such as \"Eating Raoul\" and \"Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills\".\n\n\n"}

Also similar is the regionally lowest jobseeker seat of Derbyshire Dales, with only 1.5% of the population registered as jobseekers.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n"}

The example below depicts the acetalisation reaction of D-ribose 1. With acetone or 2,2-dimethoxypropane as the acetalisation reagent the reaction is under thermodynamic reaction control and results in the pentose 2. The latter reagent in itself is an acetal and therefore the reaction is actually a cross-acetalisation.\n\nKinetic reaction control results from 2-methoxypropene as the reagent. D-ribose in itself is a hemiacetal and in equilibrium with the pyranose 3. In aqueous solution ribose is 75% pyranose and 25% furanose and a different acetal 4 is formed.\n\nSelective acetalization of carbohydrate and formation of acetals possessing atypical properties is achieved by using arylsulfonyl acetals. An example of arylsulfonyl acetals as carbohydrate-protective groups are phenylsulfonylethylidene acetals. These acetals are resistant to the acid hydrolysis and can be deprotected easily by classical reductive conditions.\n\n"}

The album lacks much of the rock edge of the previous albums up to and including \"On Air\".\n\nThe themes of time, time travel, and memory of the past had been suggested by Parsons as subject matter for the second Alan Parsons Project album, but writing partner Eric Woolfson favoured a purely futuristic theme of robotic beings eventually displacing the human race, which eventually resulted in the album \"I Robot\".\n\n\"Temporalia\" features a narration by professor Frank Close on the idea of the universe itself acting as a sort of time machine; this is an extract of \"Equinox – The rubber Universe\". \"Press Rewind\" ponders what he might do if he were able to reverse time, and change decisions he had made. \"Out Of The Blue\" relates to a time traveller from the future. \"Call Up\" is about travelling to the past and bringing back all the great people in history, to help change the world. \"Ignorance Is Bliss\" talks about how sad people are in comparison to ancient and simpler times, and the possibility of change for good to a simple way of life. \"Rubber Universe\" is related to the expansion of the universe.\n\n\"The Call Of The Wild\" talks about a future when mankind will be one without any separation (ethnicities, faith, nations, etc.). The melody of this song is a variation of the traditional Irish folk song \"She Moves Through the Fair\". \"No Future In The Past\" talks about avoiding repeating past mistakes. \"The Very Last Time\" is a song about people that have gone and never been seen again. The song was written about Bairnson's recently deceased dog, Gemma. \"Far Ago And Long Away\" is a play on words, as in relativity space = time, so \"far away\" = \"far ago\" and \"long ago\" = \"long away\".\n\nThe album cover has several images related to time and popular time-travel icons, including a photography camera, a clock mechanism, a police box as a reference to the TARDIS in \"Doctor Who\", a wormhole-like tunnel effect from the opening sequence, a DeLorean sports car referring to the \"Back to the Future\" series, and a child playing with a model ship from the \"Star Trek\" franchise.\n\n\n\nOn the Japanese release, \"The Time Machine\" is named \"H.G. Force\" (a reference to H.G. Wells).\n\n\"Dr. Evil (edit),\" features the voice of Mike Myers from the second Austin Powers movie, \"\", in which The Alan Parsons Project is mentioned. It is available on most releases which feature a bonus track. \"Beginnings\" is available only on the Japanese release.\n\n\n"}

Simpson had held the seat since 1992, when he unseated the Conservative Martin Brandon-Bravo.\n\nThe seat is the most economically diverse of the three Nottingham constituencies covering higher income and lower income output areas (sub-divisions of wards). In 2010 it was the most marginal of the seats, changing hands on several occasions over the previous few decades, though is now a very safe Labour seat. There are below-national levels of unemployment claimants, for example at the end of 2010 male claimants were less than half as many as in Nottingham North. The Labour majority has since grown to 6,000 in 2015 and over 15,000 in 2017, making it a safe seat.\n\nThe constituency is also the most politically diverse of the three city seats which together form Nottingham City Council. In the 2007 elections for Nottingham City Council, the constituency elected 9 of the 42 Labour councillors, 6 of the 7 Conservatives and 5 of the 6 Liberal Democrats.\n\nNottingham South contains at least parts of both of the city's universities. The University of Nottingham's University Park Campus and Jubilee Campus are both in the constituency, as is the Clifton Campus of Nottingham Trent University. Many of these students are based in rows of terraced housing in the Lenton and Radford wards of this seat. A minority of students and much of the universities' staff are based in neighbouring Beeston, but this falls within the Broxtowe constituency.\n\nThe constituency borders several other seats in Nottingham city and the surrounding area. It is surrounded to the South and East by Rushcliffe constituency, which is represented by Kenneth Clarke. To the West, it borders Broxtowe and both Nottingham North and Nottingham East to the North.\n\n2010–present: The City of Nottingham wards of Bridge, Clifton North, Clifton South, Dunkirk and Lenton, Leen Valley, Radford and Park, Wollaton East and Lenton Abbey, and Wollaton West.\n\n1983–2010: The City of Nottingham wards of Abbey, Bridge, Clifton East, Clifton West, Lenton, Park, Robin Hood, Wilford, and Wollaton.\n\n1955–1974: The County Borough of Nottingham wards of Bridge, Clifton, Lenton, and Trent, and the Urban District of West Bridgford.\n\n1918–1955: The County Borough of Nottingham wards of Bridge, Castle, Meadows, and Trent.\n\n1885–1918: The Municipal Borough of Nottingham wards of Bridge, Castle, Market, Meadow, St Mary, and Trent.\n\nSince as early as 1295, Nottingham was represented by one large constituency which elected two members of parliament to the House of Commons. Under a major Act of 1885 three single-member subdivisions were created: Nottingham East, Nottingham West and Nottingham South.\n\nNottingham South was abolished in the election of February 1974 but was re-formed with altered boundaries nine years later in 1983 from parts of Nottingham East and Nottingham West.\n\nNottingham South is the most diverse of the three constituencies in terms of economic demographics. It includes areas of higher incomes than average in the form of Wollaton and The Park Estate and areas of relative poverty, both suburban and inner city. The council estate built next to and within the bounds of the village/parish of Clifton was once the largest in Europe.\n\nResults to date excluding under the Blair Ministry when it was quite firmly Labour have produced the most marginal majorities of Nottingham City's three constituencies. The Conservative Martin Brandon-Bravo held the seat from 1983–92. Between 1992-2017, Nottingham South was held by Labour MPs; Alan Simpson until retiring from the House of Commons in 2010 and Lilian Greenwood from 2010.\nCommunities or localities in Nottingham South include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Overall, its census Super Output Areas have the lowest income of the three Nottingham constituencies, and was the city's safest seat for the Labour Party, though 2017 and 2019 saw considerable increases in the Conservative vote, in line with other Leave and heavily working-class areas, making this seat now Nottingham's most marginal for Labour. Male unemployment in 2010 was significantly higher than female unemployment in this constituency, which had the highest overall percentage of claimants in the county of Nottinghamshire, slightly more than Nottingham East.\n\nThe decline of coal mining and the textile industry in the area in 1970–2000 brought the highest unemployment in the county to Nottingham North, with a peak of 12.8% of its residents being registered unemployed in 2009.\n\nThe constituency was created in 1955 and elected Labour candidates as MPs until Richard Ottaway surprisingly gained it for the Conservative Party in their landslide victory of 1983, before narrowly losing in 1987 to Graham Allen, for Labour, who held it until 2017 when he stood down after 30 years of service.

It is exclusive to Disneyland, although a similarly themed area can be found within Adventureland at Tokyo Disneyland.\n\nThe word \"square\" is a bit of a misnomer, since the area does not resemble a traditional urban plazza as much as an intricate series of \"streets\" that weave around shops, restaurants and the Pirates of the Caribbean show building. At one point, it included the only overnight accommodations in the park open to the public, the now closed Disneyland Dream Suite.\n\nPlans to include a New Orleans-themed area were made in the late 1950s as a part of an expansion and the area was even included on a 1958 souvenir map.

This is the first time the seat has been represented by a Conservative since its creation in 1885.\n\nThe seat, in recent times, has been considered a relatively marginal seat. The Mansfield council area voted with more than 70 % to Leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum. In 2019, the Conservatives received 63.9 % of the vote in the formerly safe Labour constituency.\n\nThe constituency covers the towns of Mansfield and Warsop, Nottinghamshire.\n\nThe Boundary Commission for England caused changes to constituency to allow for regional and local population changes, noticeably by moving the small town of Market Warsop from Bassetlaw into Mansfield constituency. The boundaries since the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies (since the 2010 general election) were coterminous with the Borough of Mansfield, to have wards:\n\nMansfield's elected executive mayor Tony Egginton unilaterally decided to reduce the number of ward councillors (from 46 to 36) whilst simultaneously increasing the number of wards from 17 + 2 (shown above) to 36 by applying to the Boundary Commission to re-structure ward layout and boundaries from 2011:\n\n\nThe seat was created in the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 and in the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century its economy centred on coal mining and the market town itself. Among many classes of local labourers saw organised Labour Party support, in Trade Unions, party clubs and civic society. Progression in the party's polling was heightened from the early 1920s when the seat joined many wrested from the Liberal Party, enabling the formation of the first Labour government. By length of tenure and in great majorities a safe seat status emerged for Labour (on the basis of these standard criteria) in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1980s general elections Labour's Mansfield candidates came closer to losing to Conservatives. At the 1983 election, Labour held the seat by just over 2,000 votes – at the following, in 1987, 56 votes. That election was set against the background of the party HQ-backed miners' strike of 1984, not supported by the majority of miners in Nottinghamshire.\n\nIn the elections after 1987 until 2017, the Labour MP Alan Meale held Mansfield with relatively large majorities. He was knighted in 2012 after receiving the award in the Queen's Birthday Honours list.\n\nAt the 2005 general election, independent candidate Stewart Rickersey, a local District Councillor, took 17% of the vote, finishing in third place.\n\nAt the 2010 general election, Andre Camilleri, another candidate from Mansfield Independent Forum and previously a local councillor with special responsibility as a Cabinet Member for Mansfield District Council during 2003 to 2007, was placed fourth with 9% of the vote, above the 5% deposit threshold.\n\nAt the 2015 general election, the UKIP candidate Sid Pepper received 25% of the vote placing him third; this dropped to 5% at the 2017 election.\n\nGeneral Election 1914/15:\n\nAnother General Election was required to take place before the end of 1915.

The station is situated at the heart of the Tampines Town Centre next to Tampines Avenue 4, Tampines Central 4 and Tampines Central 5, within the proximity of Tampines Bus Interchange and Tampines Concourse Bus Interchange. It is one of five Singapore MRT stations that interchanges between an elevated and underground line.\n\nDue to construction constraints, the East West and Downtown line stations are not connected by a paid linkway and passengers are required to exit and reenter the paid area of either stations within 15 minutes to avoid incurring additional costs.\n\nTampines station was originally called Tampines North before receiving its present name on 13 May 1984. The contract was awarded to Sato Kogyo Pte Ltd for the construction of the line from Changi Depot to Pasir Ris, including Simei, Tampines and Pasir Ris stations on 11 March 1986. The East West line station opened on 16 December 1989. Since then, the Land Transport Authority has continuously upgraded the station with newer amentities.\n\nThe Station Upgrade Programme began in January 2001 with the installation of a lift, wider faregates and the upgrading of the facade to have a modern feel and aesthetics, which was completed in October 2002. The platforms were retrofitted with platform screen doors beginning on 17 April 2011 with operations commencing on 2 July 2011.\n\nIn a bid to improve the ventilation and air circulation at all elevated stations, the platforms were installed with high-volume low-speed fans. Tampines station was the first to be fitted, with the fans in operation on 28 May 2012. TITAN faregates replaced the former Cubic first generation faregates on 29 June 2012.\n\nThe contract for the construction of the station was awarded to KTC Civil Engineering & Construction Pte Ltd at a contract sum of S$118.5 million in July 2011.\n\nThe Downtown line station opened on 21 October 2017. Due to the density of the housing blocks in the area and the distance to the East West line station, a dedicated linkway was deemed unfeasible to build. Passengers are required to transit through a public walkway to transfer between either lines.\n\nOn 8 August 2003, a westbound train lost traction current at 10.13 pm and stalled along the track between Pasir Ris and Tampines. An empty train was used to push the train towards Tampines and service resumed at 10.35 pm. However, 21 minutes later, the traction current tripped again, this time in between the same two stations in both directions and SMRT staff only managed to restore the eastbound side before the end of operating hours. 73 passengers were stuck in a westbound train and detrainment was carried out. During both delays, eastbound services terminated at Tampines and alternative transport was provided for affected passengers.\n\nAt about 11 am on 7 May 2007, a man in his 50s hit his head against the oncoming train and got his foot stuck in the platform gap. The man was already in a semiconscious state when he was rescued by the Civil Defence and suffered injuries to his left ankle and head. Westbound train services were disrupted for about 8 minutes.\n\nOn 7 August that year, a 48-year-old Chinese man fell onto the westbound track at the station. SCDF received a call about an incident at Tampines MRT station at 6.32pm. The man was pronounced dead by paramedics at 6.45pm.\n\nOn 21 January 2008, a maintenance works train which was carrying out works between Tampines and Simei (westbound) broke down, causing a disruption from 5.28 am to 12.45 pm on both the eastbound and westbound services from Pasir Ris and Tanah Merah, affecting 57,000 commuters. SMRT was fined S$387,176 (approximately US$280,000) on 10 March that year after the LTA's investigations concluded that the disruption was due to SMRT's working party not complying with operating procedures. This was specifically on securing the parked portion of the maintenance train, which comprised a locomotive and a wagon. The fine was the largest ever for a rail related incident in Singapore. According to operating procedures, during maintenance works, the portion comprising a locomotive and a Rail Grinding Vehicle will proceed with its works, while the portion of the maintenance train is detached and parked at a distance from the working zone. However, investigations from LTA and SMRT showed that SMRT did not apply the locomotive's parking brake. There was also no wheel chock placed to prevent movement along the gradient of the track. If SMRT had followed operating procedures, a roll-back would have been prevented.\n\nOn 20th of that month, SMRT announced that it had decided to appeal to the LTA against the fine. In a letter, SMRT said it had provided free shuttle bus services to help affected commuters. SMRT also mobilised more than 300 staff for on-site recovery, crowd management, dissemination of information and preparation for resumption of service. However, on 3 April 2008, LTA turned down SMRT's appeal for a lower fine and ordered SMRT to pay the fine in full within two weeks.\n\nOn 26 November 2009, a Malay man was found dead in the stations's toilet.\n\nA train developed a signalling fault at Tampines on 30 April 2012 at about 9.20 am.

It is among the small minority of net Labour-favouring English seats not siding with the Conservatives in part of the 1930s when they co-governed with the National Labour Organisation including Sir Ramsay MacDonald.\n\n1918–1950: The County Borough of Leicester wards of Abbey, Newton, St Margaret's, Westcotes, and Wyggeston.\n\n1974–1983: The County Borough of Leicester wards of Abbey, Newton, North Braunstone, St Margaret's, and Westcotes.\n\n1983–2010: The City of Leicester wards of Abbey, Beaumont Leys, Mowmacre, New Parks, North Braunstone, Rowley Fields, St Augustine's, Westcotes, and Western Park.\n\n2010–present: The City of Leicester wards of Abbey, Beaumont Leys, Braunstone Park and Rowley Fields, Fosse, New Parks, Westcotes, and Western Park.\n\nLeicester West is the whitest of the three Leicester constituencies, and the one with the highest proportion of social housing. Some areas of the seat like Braunstone and Beaumont Leys are made up of large local authority estates, and around 30% of the housing is council- or housing association-owned, the second-highest in the Midlands. The centre of the seat, the Westcotes area, is more inner-city in character and is popular with young professionals and students.\n\nHistorically this used to be the safest Labour seat in Leicester—in the 1983 general election it was the only one to remain in Labour hands. However, the high Asian populations in Leicester South and Leicester East have pushed them away from the Conservative Party; while Leicester West is still a safe Labour seat, represented by that party since the Second World War, it is the most marginal of the three Leicester seats. While it did, like the other two Leicester seats, see a significant swing to Labour in 2017, unlike the other two seats Liz Kendall's majority was not a record high for the constituency.\n\nAs of 2009, in the depths of the late-2000s recession, the constituency had the fourth-highest level of unemployment in Britain, with 13.8% of residents registered unemployed. Most of the unemployment is concentrated in areas such as Braunstone, which is traditionally one of the most deprived parts of the city.\n\nIn 1950, the seat was replaced by the constituencies of Leicester North West and Leicester South West, until 1974. In that period, Leicester North West was represented by Barnett Janner until 1970, and then by his son Greville Janner.\n\n\n\n"}
