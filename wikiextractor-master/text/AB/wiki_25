As part of the pregame ceremonies, the last Washington Redskin player announced comes on to the field holding the American flag. This task fell to Sellers who took the flag to midfield before throwing it on the ground. This upset fans in attendance and caused Sellers to issue an apology the next day. He said it was a heat of the moment thing and not meant to be a sign of disrespect.\n\nIn the 2011 season, Sellers was made the backup fullback losing the starting spot to Darrel Young. According to Young, Sellers showed no hard feelings and has even acted as a mentor to him.\nThroughout the season, Sellers played more on special teams along with being a backup fullback, tight end, and H-back.\n\nOn March 12, 2012, the Redskins released Sellers. On July 27, Sellers announced that he would be retiring from football.\n\nIn a 1999 article in The News Tribune (Tacoma, Wash.), Sellers was listed as one of the 100 greatest athletes in Washington state history.\n\nIn a February 2005 article in The Seattle Times, Sellers was named as one of the 25 greatest running backs in state history.\n\nMike Sellers has two daughters, Kaylin and Braxton.\n\n"}

{"id": "1945764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1945764", "title": "Microbolometer", "text": "Microbolometer\n\nA microbolometer is a specific type of bolometer used as a detector in a thermal camera. Infrared radiation with wavelengths between 7.5–14 μm strikes the detector material, heating it, and thus changing its electrical resistance. This resistance change is measured and processed into temperatures which can be used to create an image. Unlike other types of infrared detecting equipment, microbolometers do not require cooling.\n\nA microbolometer is an uncooled thermal sensor. Previous high resolution thermal sensors required exotic and expensive cooling methods including stirling cycle coolers and liquid nitrogen coolers. These methods of cooling made early thermal imagers expensive to operate and unwieldy to move. Also, older thermal imagers required a cool down time in excess of 10 minutes before being usable.\n\nA microbolometer consists of an array of pixels, each pixel being made up of several layers. The cross-sectional diagram shown in Figure 1 provides a generalized view of the pixel. Each company that manufactures microbolometers has their own unique procedure for producing them and they even use a variety of different absorbing materials. In this example the bottom layer consists of a silicon substrate and a readout integrated circuit (ROIC). Electrical contacts are deposited and then selectively etched away. A reflector, for example, a titanium mirror, is created beneath the IR absorbing material. Since some light is able to pass through the absorbing layer, the reflector redirects this light back up to ensure the greatest possible absorption, hence allowing a stronger signal to be produced. Next, a sacrificial layer is deposited so that later in the process a gap can be created to thermally isolate the IR absorbing material from the ROIC. A layer of absorbing material is then deposited and selectively etched so that the final contacts can be created. To create the final bridge like structure shown in Figure 1, the sacrificial layer is removed so that the absorbing material is suspended approximately 2 μm above the readout circuit. Because microbolometers do not undergo any cooling, the absorbing material must be thermally isolated from the bottom ROIC and the bridge like structure allows for this to occur. After the array of pixels is created the microbolometer is encapsulated under a vacuum to increase the longevity of the device. In some cases the entire fabrication process is done without breaking vacuum.\n\nThe quality of images created from microbolometers has continued to increase. The microbolometer array is commonly found in two sizes, 320×240 pixels or less expensive 160×120 pixels. Current technology has led to the production of devices with 640×480 or 1024x768 pixels. There has also been a decrease in the individual pixel dimensions. The pixel size was typically 45 μm in older devices and has been decreased to 12 μm in current devices. As the pixel size is decreased and the number of pixels per unit area is increased proportionally, an image with higher resolution is created, but with a higher NETD (Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference (differential)) due to smaller pixels being less sensitive to IR radiation.\n\nThere is a wide variety of materials that are used for the detector element in microbolometers. A main factor in dictating how well the device will work is the device's responsivity. Responsivity is the ability of the device to convert the incoming radiation into an electrical signal. Detector material properties influence this value and thus several main material properties should be investigated: TCR, 1/f Noise, and Resistance.\n\nThe material used in the detector must demonstrate large changes in resistance as a result of minute changes in temperature. As the material is heated, due to the incoming infrared radiation, the resistance of the material decreases. This is related to the material's temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) specifically its negative temperature coefficient. Industry currently manufactures microbolometers that contain materials with TCRs near −2%/K. Although many materials exist that have far higher TCRs, there are several other factors that need to be taken into consideration when producing optimized microbolometers.\n\n1/f noise, like other noises, causes a disturbance that affects the signal and that may distort the information carried by the signal. Changes in temperature across the absorbing material are determined by changes in the bias current or voltage flowing through the detecting material. If the noise is large then small changes that occur may not be seen clearly and the device is useless. Using a detector material that has a minimum amount of 1/f noise allows for a clearer signal to be maintained between IR detection and the output that is displayed. Detector material must be tested to assure that this noise does not significantly interfere with signal.\n\nUsing a material that has low room temperature resistance is also important. Lower resistance across the detecting material mean less power will need to be used. Also, there is a relationship between resistance and noise, the higher the resistance the higher the noise. Thus, for easier detection and to satisfy the low noise requirement, resistance should be low.\n\nThe two most commonly used IR radiation detecting materials in microbolometers are amorphous silicon and vanadium oxide. Much research has been done to test the feasibility of other materials to be used. Those investigated include: Ti, YBaCuO, GeSiO, poly SiGe, BiLaSrMnO and protein-based cytochrome C and bovine serum albumin.\n\nAmorphous Si (a-Si) works well because it can easily be integrated into the CMOS fabrication process, is highly stable, a fast time constant, and has a long mean time before failure. To create the layered structure and patterning, the CMOS fabrication process can be used but it requires temperatures to stay below 200˚C on average. A problem with some potential materials is that to create the desirable properties their deposition temperatures may be too high although this is not a problem for a-Si thin films. a-Si also possesses excellent values for TCR, 1/f noise and resistance when the deposition parameters are optimized.\n\nVanadium oxide thin films may also be integrated into the CMOS fabrication process although not as easily as a-Si for temperature reasons. VO is an older technology than a-Si, and for these reasons its performance and longevity are less. Deposition at high temperatures and performing post-annealing allows for the production of films with superior properties although acceptable films can still be made subsequently fulfilling the temperature requirements. VO has low resistance but undergoes a metal-insulator phase change near 67 °C and also has a lower value of TCR. On the other hand, VO exhibits high resistance and also high TCR. Many phases of VO exist although it seems that x≈1.8 has become the most popular for microbolometer applications.\n\nMost microbolometers contain a temperature sensitive resistor which makes them a passive electronic device. In 1994 one company, Electro-Optic Sensor Design (EOSD), began looking into producing microbolometers that used a thin film transistor (TFT), which is a special kind of field effect transistor. The main change in these devices would be the addition of a gate electrode. Although the main concepts of the devices are similar, using this design allows for the advantages of the TFT to be utilized. Some benefits include tuning of the resistance and activation energy and the reduction of periodic noise patterns. As of 2004 this device was still being tested and was not used in commercial IR imaging.\n\n\n\nThe sensitivity is partly limited by the thermal conductance of the pixel. The speed of response is limited by the thermal heat capacity divided by the thermal conductance. Reducing the heat capacity increases the speed but also increases statistical mechanical thermal temperature fluctuations (noise). Increasing the thermal conductance raises the speed, but decreases sensitivity.\n\nMicrobolometer technology was originally developed by Honeywell starting in the late 1970s as a classified contract for the US Department of Defense. The US Government declassified the technology in 1992. After declassification Honeywell licensed their technology to several manufacturers.\n\n\n\n"}

He became a singer and songwriter, and proficient musician on the guitar, autoharp, harmonica, clawhammer banjo, and jaw harp.\n\nWhen he married Hattie Frost in November 1918, he entered another musically involved family. He and Hattie had 23 children, 13 of whom survived to adulthood: \n\nStoneman worked at a variety of jobs, in mines, mills, but mostly carpentry, and played music for his own enjoyment and that of his neighbors, but when he heard a Henry Whitter record in 1924, he determined to better it and changed his life as well. Stoneman went to New York City in September 1924 and cut two songs for the Okeh Records label. The record was shelved and he had to return for another recording session in January 1925. Ralph Peer directed him through several sessions for Okeh and Victor, and he freelanced on other labels such as Edison, Gennett and Paramount Records. In 1926, he added family musicians to his group for a full string band sound.\n\nIn July and August 1927, Stoneman helped Peer conduct the legendary Bristol sessions that led to the discovery of the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers. He continued to be active in recording through 1929. Between 1925 and 1929 Stoneman recorded more than 200 songs.\n\nFalling on hard times during the Depression, the Stonemans and their nine surviving children moved to the Washington, D.C. area in 1932 after losing their home and most of their possessions. There they had four more children and struggled through dire poverty, with Stoneman taking whatever work he could find and trying to revive his musical career.\n\nIn 1941, Stoneman bought a lot in Carmody Hills, Maryland, where he built a shack for the family and eventually obtained a more or less regular job at the Naval Gun Factory. In 1947, the Stoneman Family won a talent contest at Constitution Hall that gave them six months' exposure on local television. In 1956, Pop won $10,000 on the NBC-TV quiz show \"The Big Surprise\" and sang on the show as well. That same year, the Blue Grass Champs, a group composed largely of his children, were winners on the CBS-TV program \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\", and Mike Seeger recorded Pop and Hattie for Folkways.\n\nStoneman retired from labor and the Champs went full-time to become the Stonemans. They did albums for Starday in 1962 and 1963 and in 1964, went to Texas and California, cutting an album for World Pacific, playing at Disneyland, on some network shows and at several folk festivals.\n\nIn 1965, they went to Nashville, where they signed a contract with MGM Records and started a syndicated TV show. They received CMA's \"Vocal Group of the Year\" in 1967. They appeared in the 1967 film \"Hell on Wheels\" and in The Road to Nashville (1967).\n\nPop Stoneman died in 1968 at age 75. He is interred in the Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville.\n\nOn February 12, 2008, Ernest \"Pop\" Stoneman was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame and in 2009 he and his wife Hattie Frost Stoneman were enshrined in the Gennett Records Walk of Fame.\n\nThe first major retrospective of his musical career \"Ernest Stoneman: The Unsung Father of Country Music 1925–1934\" (5 String Productions) was issued in 2008 by the Grammy award-winning reissue team of Christopher C. King and Henry Sapoznik and was nominated for a 2009 Grammy award for \"Best Album Notes.\"\n\n"}

Those playing the game take on the role of a bartender attempting to maximize tips from customers.\n\nThe game was developed by Cutler Creative and supported Windows 95 and Windows 98. The game's creator, John Cutler, first got the idea for the game in 1995. He wanted to have a game that could teach people to mix drinks. Under the original title Bartender USA, the player would start at a Howard Johnson's and gradually work their way up to a trendy bar in New York City. At the time, Cutler had no video game experience, and didn't own a computer until he started development. He attended E3 and also worked as a bartender to better understand what he needed to do. He hired programmers and artists to put together a mockup of the game. The original concept included some live action animation, which was dropped from the final game. Simon & Schuster had recently published the comedy game Deer Avenger, and agreed to publish the game since it matched up with their business model at the time. This agreement gave Cutler's team funding to develop and complete the game. Due to Cutler's inexperience, many aspects of the game needed to be rethought during the development process. Cutler credited his choice to use Macromedia Director as making a mammoth task much easier. He struggled with feature creep and his relationship with the testing company.\n\nThe setting of the game is a fictional bar in New York City. The player, as bartender, must learn to mix over one hundred drinks. They also have to ID all customers (serving an underage customer will get the player fired), charm customers, keep music playing, and keep customers from being too drunk. The game offers a recipe book for players, but players will score better if they don't use it. Also, without memorizing the recipes, the player will run out of time. The ultimate goal of the game is to get the most tips. There are around 20 characters that the player needs to serve in the game. One of these characters is Vincent the Hedgehog, who is an actual hedgehog.\n\nReview of the game were mixed. Ben Silverman of Game Revolution describes it as a casual game, and not one that a player would expect to play for hours. Silverman described it as a replacement for Solitaire that wouldn't hook players, but also stated that with its low price, it may be worth buying. Lisa Savignano of All Game praised the creative characters, but noted that some of the graphics were poor. IGN appreciated the large library of drinks, but noted that the animation was often clunky.\n\nThe game sold poorly and was a flop. Despite this, for the French and UK market under the name Happy Hour, and in Germany under the name On the Rocks. Cutler was surprised at the nearly even ratio of male to female purchasers.\n\nThe video game is rated mature and is not recommended for those younger than 21.\n"}

The tree ranges from southern Ontario and Quebec, south to Tennessee, west to northeastern Kansas, and north to Minnesota.\n\nThe tree was named in 1902 for David Thomas, an American civil engineer who had first named and described the tree in 1831 as \"Ulmus racemosa\".\n\n\"Ulmus thomasii\" grows as a tree from tall, and may live for up to 300 years. Where forest-grown, the crown is cylindrical and upright with short branches, and is narrower than most other elms. Rock elm is also unusual among North American elms in that it is often monopodial. The bark is grey-brown and deeply furrowed into scaly, flattened ridges. Many older branches have 3–4 irregular thick corky wings. It is for this reason the rock elm is sometimes called the cork elm.\n\nThe leaves are long and wide, oval to obovate with a round, symmetrical base and acuminate apex. The leaf surface is shiny dark green, turning bright yellow in autumn; the underside is pubescent. The perfect apetalous, wind-pollinated flowers are red-green and appear in racemes up to long two weeks before the leaves from March to May, depending on the tree's location. The fruit is a broad ovate samara long covered with fine hair, notched at the tip, and maturing during May or June to form drooping clusters at the leaf bases.\n\nAlthough \"U. thomasii\" is protandrous, levels of self-pollination remain high.\n\n\"Ulmus thomasii\" is moderately shade-tolerant. Its preferred habitat is moist but well-drained sandy loam, loam, or silt loam soil, mixed with other hardwoods. However, it also grows on dry uplands, especially on rocky ridges and limestone bluffs.\n\nLike most North American elms, \"U. thomasii\" is very susceptible to Dutch elm disease.\n\nThere are no known cultivars of \"Ulmus thomasii\", nor is it known to be any longer in commerce. It appeared in some US nursery catalogues in the early 20th century. The species is occasionally grown beyond its native range as a specimen tree in botanical gardens and arboreta, for example in northwestern Europe, but not commonly cultivated in northern Europe, being unsuited to the region's more temperate, maritime climate.\n\n\"Ulmus thomasii\" was crossed experimentally with Japanese elm (\"U. davidiana\" var. \"japonica\") at the Arnold Arboretum in Massachusetts, but no clones were released to commerce. Seedlings arising from crossings with Siberian elm (\"U. pumila\") at the Lake States Forestry Experimental Station in the 1950s all perished, a classic case of hybrid lethality.\n\nThe USA National Champion, measuring high in 1989, grows in Cass County, Michigan.\n\nThe wood of the rock elm is the hardest and heaviest of all elms, and where forest-grown remains comparatively free of knots and other defects. It is also very strong and takes a high polish, and consequently was once in great demand in America and Europe for a wide range of uses, notably shipbuilding, furniture, agricultural tools, and musical instruments.\n\nMuch of the timber's strength is derived from the tight grain arising from the tree's very slow rate of growth, the trunk typically increasing in diameter by less than a year. Over 250 annual growth rings were once counted in a log square being sawn for gunwales in an English boatyard, while a tree once grown at Kew Gardens, London, attained a height of only in 50 years.\n\n\n"}

Zoom produces effects pedals for guitars and basses, recording equipment, and drum machines. The company has become known for producing handheld recorders, audio for video solutions, inexpensive multi-effects and builds products around its own microchip designs.\n\n\nAt the time it was released, the GFX-8 was the flagship of the Zoom GFX series.\n\nIt has a solid steel dark green body with an opto-based pedal on the right and red LED display on the top left. It uses the Variable Architecture Modeling System (V.A.M.S) technology. In general, there are three main internal modules: for drive, for modulation and for delay. The unit allows a high level of distortion customization by using specialized software. It also allows the use of external distortion. The technology used in the unit does not allow full reordering of the effects but allows some of modulation effects like wah and phaser to be connected before or after the drive module. The drive module implements dynamic related effects like compressor, overdrive, distortion and fuzz. After the drive module, the noise gate module called ZNR (ZOOM Noise Reduction) is connected, followed by a parametric equalizer (presence, treble, middle, bass). The amp simulation module is connected next and allows various types of guitar amplifier simulations. The modulation module implements effects like wah, phaser, chorus, ring modulator, tremolo, vibrato, flanger and pitch shifter. The delay module is used to implement delay and reverb effects. Effects that require high processing power use modulation and delay module together. One such effect is the jam play effect, which allows, for example, a guitar player to play a rhythm guitar part and then play a solo part over it. The unit design is oriented toward ease of use by providing more knobs than usually found on such units, thus making the unit look more like a chain of effect boxes instead of the typical effect processor with a \"few knobs many functions\" type design. The unit has mature MIDI capabilities, allowing both control from an external sequencer or using the unit as a MIDI controller.

Batchelder\n\nErnest Allan Batchelder (January 22, 1876 – August 6, 1957) was an American artist and educator who made Southern California his home in the early 20th century. He created art tiles and was a leader in the American Arts and Crafts Movement.\n\nIn 1894 Ernest A. Batchelder began attending classes at Massachusetts Normal Art School (now Massachusetts College of Art and Design), which was founded in 1873 with the intention to support the Massachusetts Drawing Act of 1870 by providing drawing teachers for the public schools as well as training professional artists, designers, and architects. In 1899 he received his Public School Class diploma. Batchelder came to Pasadena, California, in the early 1900s to teach, and became director of the art department at Throop Polytechnic Institute, the predecessor of the California Institute of Technology.\n\nBatchelder's life took a turn in 1909 when, behind his house overlooking the Arroyo Seco, he built a kiln and entered the business of creating hand-crafted art tiles. The tiles were hugely popular, and by the 1920s, Batchelder's tiles could be found in homes and buildings across the United States. Batchelder's prominence in Southern California's art community included his involvement in the founding of the Pasadena Art Institute and his membership in the Pasadena Society of Artists. Batchelder was also the third Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Pasadena Playhouse, to which he contributed an original tile fireplace and fountain (recently restored).\n\nThe style in which Batchelder worked was highly distinctive. First, he used a single-fire process known as engobe in which a primary wash of colored clay slip (usually pale blue) was applied to the surface of the tile before being fired, pooling in the recesses of the design, with excess being wiped off. Then the tile was fired. A typical glazed tile is fired twice–once before glaze, and once after, thereby sealing in the added color. Batchelder's designs often drew on Medieval themes but also included flowers, vines, and California oaks; birds, particularly peacocks; Mayan patterns; Byzantine themes; and geometric shapes.\n\nBatchelder architectural tiles met with great success, and the company moved twice, expanding each time. Its tiles appear on the walls and floors of many New York City apartment house lobbies, and can be found in shops, restaurants, swimming pools and hotels throughout the United States.\n\nOne of Batchelder's last and largest projects was the Hershey Hotel in Hershey, Pennsylvania, built by the famous chocolate manufacturer in 1930, in order to give jobs to many local residents who would otherwise have been unemployed during the Depression. Batchelder tiles appeared on the walls, floors and stair risers of a dazzling fountain room, complete with central pool and a mezzanine level. Unfortunately, Batchelder's company, which had employed 150 men at its peak, was forced out of business by the Great Depression in 1932; although Batchelder continued to make pottery in a small shop in Pasadena until the early 1950s. In addition to the Batchelder Tile Company, there were numerous other California tile manufacturers. The abundant local clays, inexpensive fuel, power, and cheap labour were all factors that contributed to an active tile industry, while the rapidly growing population led to a continual demand for new buildings. Moreover, the most popular local architectural styles, such as Spanish, Mediterranean and Colonial Revival, use large amounts of tile.\n\nOne of Batchelder's famous earliest commissions became Los Angeles Historical-Cultural Monument No. 137: a Dutch-themed Chocolate Shop. The cocoa-brown walls were crowned with tiles of Dutch maidens, wooden clogs, and windmills.\n\n\"It's certainly one of the most beautiful and extravagant tile interiors in Los Angeles or anywhere,\" said Ken Bernstein, manager of the city's Office of Historic Resources. \"It's a remarkable example of the use of ceramic tile and a preeminent example of Batchelder's work.\"\n\nThe Batchelder House built in Pasadena, California, in the early 1900s, and where he set up his first kiln, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The current resident, Dr. Robert Winter, wrote the definitive Batchelder history, \"Batchelder Tilemaker\" (Balcony Press, 1999, 112 pp, ). Although the house is not open to the public, some Batchelder tiles, stamped with heraldic animals and figures, may be found on the walkway in front of the dwelling.\n\nBatchelder wrote two books on tile design: \"The Principal of Design,\" (1901); \"Design in Theory and Practice,\" (1911).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1945819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1945819", "title": "Kushiel's Dart", "text": "Kushiel's Dart\n\nKushiel's Dart is a fantasy novel by American writer Jacqueline Carey, the first book in her Kushiel's Legacy series. The idea for this book first came to Carey when she was reading the Biblical Book of Genesis, and specifically a passage about \"sons of God\" coming into the \"daughters of Men\". Later, when she was writing a coffee table book, she encountered Jewish folklore, which paralleled the story in greater detail. The fictional nation of Terre D'Ange in the story was founded by a rebel angel.\n\nThe Kushiel's Legacy series takes place in a medieval world that is modeled on Earth (the map at the beginning of the novels is a map of Earth, with creatively historically named countries). The main characters are from Terre d'Ange, which occupies the area of France.\n\nTerre d'Ange was founded by Elua and His Companions and is thereby a nation of progeny of fallen angels.\n\nEach of Elua's companions founded a province of Terre d'Ange, except Cassiel, who chose to remain loyal to the commandments of the One God and not 'commingle with mortals'.\n\nElua's precept was \"Love as thou wilt\". This results in the fact that love and physical pleasure is a central aspect of society in Terre d'Ange. Although marriage exists in Terre d'Ange, it is viewed equally with other forms of love, including dalliance, taking a lover or consort, etc. It likewise engendered an acceptance of any form of love, be it reverent or harsh, heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual. Usually, as part of a marriage, a D'Angeline lights a candle to Eisheth, asking her to \"open the womb\" of the woman so that she may be able to become pregnant.\n\nOne of the central institutions of Terre d'Ange is service to the angel Naamah. As such, her adepts are courtesans who prostitute themselves in a sacred service that honours Naamah's similar sacrifice to Elua. Naamah was said to have 'la[in] down with strangers in the marketplace for coin' in order that Elua could eat when the Companions had no money. She also, according to legend, offered herself to the King of Persis in exchange for Elua's freedom. In Naamah's honour, Servants of Naamah provide sexual services to paying clients (which goes to the owner of their marque, or into the pockets of the courtesans who have earned their marques) and an optional 'patron gift' freely offered in honour of Naamah (which pays for the marque to be tattooed onto the courtesans' backs).\n\nThe Court of Night-Blooming Flowers, or the \"Night Court,\" is in the City of Elua and comprises Thirteen Houses. Each house has a head, called the Dowayne. Each Servant of Naamah owes a debt to their House for the training they have received, and in many cases upbringing. Their debt is considered complete when their marque, a tattoo covering the entire back, is complete.\n\nTerre D'Ange exists in a monarchical system, which is currently ruled by the Courcel line. They are directly descended from Elua, and their signature physical attribute is a graceful neck, which parallels the fact that their emblem is the Swan.\n\nEach region has its own ruling elite in a feudal structure.\n\nThe courts are separate from the feudal ruling class and function in a similar fashion to present-day European courts including various levels of appellate courts. Final appeals can be brought to the King/Queen, who will either hear a case or rule that the previous judgements were appropriate and thereby refuse to hear the appeal. D'Angelines are known to treat their criminals and prisoners in a fashion similar to that of present-day European standards, though capital punishment and public floggings are practised. Rape is a capital offense.\n\nThe book follows Phèdre nó Delaunay's life from birth. She's born with a mote in her eye, which makes her appear inappropriate for service as a religious courtesan, but it is revealed that this is actually a sign that she is an 'anguissette' or sexual masochist, deriving sexual pleasure from pain. Her bond is purchased by a nobleman who does train her as a courtesan, and discovers a plot against her homeland which she has a chance to interrupt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Kushiel's Dart\" won the 2002 Locus Award for Best First Novel. It was also nominated for the 2002 Gaylactic Spectrum Awards.\n"}

It is under the administration of Taketomi District, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. In local language, the island's name is pronounced \"Patuma\".\n\nHatoma is located just north of Iriomote. It is a tiny island, with an area of just , a circumference of , and a population of roughly 60.\n\nHatoma has been continuously inhabited for at least several centuries, if not longer. Excavations on the island have shown that until recent times, Hatoma residents subsisted largely on shellfish gathered in the surrounding shallow waters, and vegetables.\n\nUnlike nearby Iriomote, Hatoma was not infested by malaria; hence its long-term settlement.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Hatoma flourished as a skipjack tuna fishing port. At that time, the population of the island numbered in the hundreds. In 1968, because of the declining economic viability of skipjack tuna fishing (partly due to decreased consumption of katsuobushi due to the use of MSG in its stead), katsuobushi (dried and smoked skipjack tuna) processing facilities on the island were shut down, but the demographic decline started well before this.\n\nWith the decline of its only industry, the population of Hatoma rapidly shrank. When the population of its only school fell to just a handful, the Taketomi authorities attempted to shut it down. The island residents, however, fought to keep the school open, and succeeded by using an innovative program: households take in the children from mainland Japan who, for reasons of stress or mental difficulties, could not attend a local school, and send them to the school on Hatoma. This program, called \"Kaihin Ryūgaku（海浜留学）\" (foster homes), still survives to this day, and the school's doors remain open.\n\nBeing a small, outlying island, infrastructure was slow to come to Hatoma; the island did not receive electricity until the 1960s.\n\nFeatured in the 2005 Japanese television drama \"Ruri no shima\" (Ruri's Island), by Nippon TV.\n\n"}
{"id": "1945833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1945833", "title": "Khmu people", "text": "Khmu people\n\nThe Khmu (; Khmu: ; ; ; ; ; ) are an ethnic group of Southeast Asia. The majority (88%) live in northern Laos where they constitute the largest minority ethnic group, comprising eleven percent of the total population. Alternative historical English spellings include Kmhmu, Kemu and Khammu, among others.\n\nThe Khmu can also be found in southwest China (in Xishuangbanna in Yunnan province), and in recent centuries have migrated to areas of Burma, Thailand and Vietnam (where they are an officially recognized ethnic group). In the People's Republic of China, however, they are not given official recognition as a separate \"national\" group, but are rather classified as a subgroup of Bulang.\n\nThe endonym \"Khmu\" is suspected to stem from their word \"kymhmuʔ\" meaning \"people\". Khmu also often refer to their ethnicity as \"pruʔ\".\n\nThe Khmu were the indigenous inhabitants of northern Laos. It is generally believed the Khmu once inhabited a much larger area. After the influx of Thai/Lao peoples into the lowlands of Southeast Asia, the Khmu were forced to higher ground (Lao Theung), above the rice-growing lowland Lao and below the Hmong/Mien groups (Lao Sung) that inhabit the highest regions, where they practiced swidden agriculture. There are more than 568,000 Khmu around the world, with populations of 500,000 in Laos, 73,000 in Vietnam, 10,000 in Thailand, 10,000 in China, and an estimated 8,000-10,000 in the United States.\n\nThe Khmu of Laos reside mainly in the North, ranging across 10 provinces. The Khmu form the largest ethnic group, outnumbering even the Lao, in five Northern provinces (Luang Prabang, Phongsaly, Oudomxay, Bokeo and Luangnamtha Provinces). The Khmu of Thailand are clustered in Nan Province near the Thailand-Laos border.\n\nMost Khmu villages are isolated, and only slowly receiving electricity. In many areas the Khmu live alongside the Hmong and other regional minority ethnic groups. The Khmu in the United States originated as refugees from the Vietnam War. Most of these refugees settled in California, which is home to both the Khmu National Federation, Inc., and the Khmu Catholic National Center.\n\nMany of the Khmu in Thailand have arrived recently from Laos and Vietnam, also as refugees from the Vietnam War and subsequent communist governments, although cross-border migrations into Thailand's Nan, Phayao and Chiang Rai provinces for new farm land and work in the teak industry began as much as 200 years ago.\n\nIn their mountain refuges, the various Khmu settlements became isolated, surrounded and partially influenced by the dominant groups of their respective areas. Accordingly, the Khmu now recognize subdivisions among themselves which are differentiated primarily by dialect. These subgroups are called \"tmowy\" () in Khmu. Some of the larger \"tmowy\" are the Tmowy Mea [tmɔi mɛ], Tmowy Ksak [tmɔi ksăk], Tmowy Rok [tmɔi rɔk] (Lao: \"kha hok\"). The Khmu north of the Tha River (\"nam tha\"), who often live in close contact with the lowland Tai Lü and Thai Yuan peoples, distinguish groups including the Tmowy Lü [tmɔi lɯʔ], Tmowy Yuan and Tmowy Khuen (\"Khuen\" is often a synonym for \"Khmu\" in general).\n\nAside from their geographical separation, the subgroups' primary differences are in dialect. However, there are slight variations in customs and cultural practices among the various \"tmowy\". The Khmu refer to others within their own \"tmowy\" as \"tay-haem\" (\"older siblings-younger siblings\"), expressing solidarity and shared ritual/common ancestral worship while referring to other Khmu by the name of their respective groups.\n\nThe Khmu groups north of the Tha River in particular, whose names reflect their partial identification with the Buddhist Tai cultures, have acculturated to the dominant ethnic groups of the region. They are often contrasted with the Khmu Roek who live higher up in the hills and retain some older customs that other groups have abandoned. While the Khmu Roek are often respected as the center of the Khmu \"socio-economic ritual complex\", \"Roek\" is also used by more assimilated Khmu as an appellation for \"backwood\" Khmu regardless of their \"tmowy\".\n\nThe Khmu language belongs to the Austro-Asiatic language family, in which several closely related languages including Puoc, O’du and Kniang, among others, are grouped together forming the Khmuic branch. The many dialects of Khmu differ primarily in consonant inventory, existence of register, and the degree to which the language has been influenced by the surrounding national language(s). Dialects are, for the most part, mutually intelligible; however communication can be difficult between speakers of geographically distant dialects.\n\nThe dialects of Khmu can be broadly categorized into two groups, Western Khmu and Eastern Khmu. Western Khmu dialects have fewer consonant phonemes and instead use phonemic register contrast of \"lax\" breathy register and \"tense\" modal register. In at least one dialect of Western Khmu, \"Khmu Roek\", tonogenesis is evident as the register contrast has developed into a system of two phonemic tones with six phonetic realizations. Eastern Khmu dialects show the opposite tendency. Completely lacking either register or tone distinction, these dialects utilize a three-way distinction of stops (voiced, voiceless and aspirated voiceless) and nasals (voiced, voiceless, and pre-glottalized) in the syllable-initial position for phonemic contrast.\n\nAlthough Khmu language use among peers is currently fairly vigorous, most, if not all, Khmu are also fluent in the language of the culturally dominant group of the area and many regularly use three or even four different languages. The Khmu of Laos, for example, speak Lao when dealing with government officials, engaging in commerce with the lowland Lao, or if attending school. Trade with other highland groups may necessitate knowledge of additional languages, such as Hmong, unless Lao can be used a lingua franca by both groups. The Khmu of Thailand are more assimilated, often living in villages among the Thai and preferring to speak Kham Meuang even at home in households with two Khmu parents.\n\nKhmuic peoples refers to a group of ethnicities of mainland Southeast Asia that speak closely related languages and follow similar customs and traditions. It is believed, based on linguistic, cultural and historical evidence, that these now-disparate groups are descended from a homogeneous ethnicity that may have been among the first populations to settle northern Indochina. This historical Khmuic people inhabited areas far larger than at present, including northern lowland areas of at least present day Thailand and Laos, until absorbed or pushed into mountainous refuges by successive Mon and Khmer empires and the later arrival of various Tai peoples.\n\nThe Khmu are an agricultural society, although gathering, hunting, trapping and fishing are parts of the Khmu lifestyle. Khmu crops include rice (especially white and black sticky rice), corn, bananas, sugar cane, cucumbers, beans, sesame and a variety of vegetables. Most of the agricultural work in Khmu villages is done communally, so as to combine the strength and finish the work quickly. Harvesting of rice from the swidden field is generally performed by the village women.\n\nRice is stored outside the village to protect from fire, and in elevated structures to protect from mice and rats. Khmu elders are traditionally the most important people of the village, and are responsible for resolving all village disputes.\n\nVillage leaders included the shaman (knowledgeable in spiritual medicine), the medicine man (knowledgeable in herbal medicine), the priest (based on family lineage of priesthood), and the village headman (in modern times chosen by the Laotian government). Laotian Khmu communities generally have localized justice systems administered by the village elders.\n\nKhmu culture is traditionally passed down by the recital of stories around evening fires. The story-telling sessions involve the sharing of silver pipes (originally opium, but now predominantly tobacco). Some Khmu are heavily tattooed for both decorative and religious reasons. In Laos, Khmu are reputed for practicing magic, and some families still engage in the casting of spells and telling of fortunes. According to the animistic practices of the Khmu, reverence is offered to the house spirit \"Hroi gang\".\n\nVillagers believe that a Khmu house, village, and its surroundings are integrated with the spirits of the land, and so houses and villages are considered holy or ritualized spaces. Typically, entire Khmu villages are enclosed in fences with three or four gates which separate the Khmu from their granaries and barns. Altars are placed outside the perimeter to ward off fires and storms.\n\nIn the past, each Khmu family was believed to be under the protection of a totem such as a boar or an eagle who had originally helped an ancestor and would continue to protect the family. In the past Khmuic people celebrated 4 festivals namely: rice planting, rice harvesting, new year, and wash or get rid of sin festivals. In ancient time Khmuic people celebrated new year festival on the first waxing moon day of the first lunar month. At present day the new year festival is mostly not practiced or if it is, it is integrated with the harvesting festival.\n\nAn ancient Khmuic house must be laid long along the direction from east to west and never intersected the direction of the sun. However, there are Khmuic who people built their houses intersecting the sun direction. Each house must have a door in the east and another one facing to the north or south. This depends on the situation of the area where the house was built and never build a door in the west side of the house. A house with straight leans must have a large outside balcony (attached with a 5 or 7 step stair) connected from the east door and a lean room with east or north door (attached with a 5 or 7 step stair).\n\nA house with bent leans (half moon shape) must have a large outside balcony (attached with a large 5 or 7 step stair) connected from a small and short lean room connected from the north or south site of the house, and an inside balcony (attached with a 5- or 7-step stair) connected from the east door. Ancient Khmuic people believed and worshiped the sun spirit for safety and health. In the early morning whichever day the sky is clear, when the sun is starting to rise, Khmuic people opened the east doors of their houses to let the sun shine into their houses.\n\nThere are three explanations for this directionality of house construction: 1. to expel devils, ghosts and bad spirits out of the houses (ancient Khmuic people believed that devils, ghosts or bad spirits fear sunlight); 2. to expel and wash out bacteria and any kinds of small insects dangerous to body and health; 3. Khmuic people also believe that the early morning sunlight is pure and fresh, so exposing one's own body to the early morning sunlight makes one's own mind fresh, good tempered, healthy and active at work. Nowadays, most Khmuic people ignore the beliefs and rules, and don't practice this way of building their houses. Roofs of houses are covered with wooden tiles or thatch.\n\nKhmu cemeteries are traditionally divided into four sections; one for natural deaths, one for accidental deaths, one for children, and one for those who died away from home. The Khmu do not generally believe in rebirth. Traditional Khmu animism puts emphasis on the concept of taboo, as villagers believe that violations of taboo result in vengeance of spirits. Forbidden activities include touching the altars or the amulets representing the house's spirit, birth ceremonies for children born feet-first, and entering a house without permission.\n\nDances to propitiate the rice goddess are common among the Khmu people; they are performed in order to ensure a good harvest.\n\n"}

Persija Jakarta is the most successful football team in Indonesia. The team has won 11 league titles and have never been relegated since the competition start in 1930. Persija is one of the teams who founded the Indonesian football association in 1930 along with several other teams.\n\nPersija was established on November 28, 1928, with the forerunner to be appointed Voetbalbond Indonesish Jakarta (VIJ). VIJ is one of the clubs participating in PSSI with the participation of VIJ representatives, Mr. Soekardi in the formation of PSSI in Societeit Hadiprojo Yogyakarta, Saturday 19 April 1930.\n\nDuring the Dutch East Indies era, Persija's initial name was VIJ (Voetbalbond Indonesische Jacatra). Post-Republic of Indonesia returned to the form of a unitary state, VIJ changed its name to Persija (Indonesian Football Association of Jakarta). At that time, NIVU (Nederlandsch Indisch Voetbal Unie) as a rival organization for PSSI still existed. On the other hand, VBO (Voetbalbond Batavia en Omstreken) as a rival (union) match for Persija also still exists.\n\nIn mid-1951, the VBO held a meeting to liquidate and ask for approval to join Persija. In its development, VBO joined Persija. In the triangle tournament, a combination of Indonesian Nation players joined in the \"new\" Persija associated with the Netherlands and the Chinese.\n\nPersija currently plays their home matches at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium along with Indonesia National Football Team.\n\nIn their history, the club used several stadium for their home ground. There are VIJ Stadium, Menteng Stadium, and Lebak Bulus Stadium. For the 2017 Liga 1, Persija along with Bhayangkara F.C) used the Patriot Chandrabhaga Stadium as their home stadium because the GBK stadium was being renovated for the 2018 Asian Games.\n\nFor the 2018 Liga 1, Persija had no fixed home pitch due to Gelora Bung Karno Stadium being used for the 2018 Asian Games, 2018 Asian Para Games, and the 2018 AFC U-19 Championship, and switched between playing their home matches at GBK, Patriot Chandrabhaga Stadium, Pakansari Stadium, Wibawa Mukti Stadium, Sultan Agung Stadium and PTIK Stadium.\n\nCurrent Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan have decide to build a new stadium for Persija in North of Jakarta, which will be called Jakarta International Stadium, and now it is being built. The new stadium is targeted to be completed by October 2021.\nFrom other source, the new stadium will be named as M.H. Thamrin Stadium to appreciate the Indonesia national hero Mohammad Husni Thamrin, which also one of the founder of Persija Jakarta.\n\nPersija Jakarta's traditional football club colour is red as their home kit. In 1997 Persija replaced it with orange colour due to the decision of Jakarta governor at that time, Sutiyoso, as he wants to make Persija's colour similar to Jakarta's government colour. Because of it, when Persija's supporter () founded in the same year, they decide to wear orange colour as the identity of Jakarta's football supporter colour. After 19 years, in 2016 they decide to return to their traditional red colour. As they believe that wearing their old colour will bring back the spirit of their glory in old era. Frequently, the colour of their away jersey is white. But in some era, black is also picked as the colour of their away jersey while orange colour was chosen as their third jersey in current era.\n\nPersija Jakarta's supporters called . Founded in 1997 by Gugun Gondrong and Ferry Indrasjarief with orange colour as their identity. is one of the biggest football club supporters in Indonesia. Mostly in every Persija's home match over 50.000 spectators come to support Persija. They were allowed to come to every place of the away match, except for the matches against Persib Bandung and Persebaya Surabaya because of restrictions by the Indonesia national security otoritation in order to avoid the clash between each supporters.\n\nNot only rival clubs that have anthems.\nThe song \"Satu Jiwa\" is an anthem that is always sung when the match is over, this song was also created directly by the Chairman of Jakmania.\n\nPersija have a rivalry with Persib Bandung. Both teams first met in the 1933 Perserikatan and competed to be champions, and at that time Persija won the competition while the Persib were runners-up. Likewise the following year in the 1934 Perserikatan, again they competed and Persija won again by beating Persib who to be runner-up again in the competition at that time. This derby is usually called as the \"\"Indonesian Derby\"\". Some people also call it as \"\"Indonesian El Clásico\"\". But, the rivalry between the two teams only heated up in the 2000s. Because of the enmity of their two supporters and the rivalry now is seen more as a rivalry between each team's supporters group (Persija's The Jakmania and Persib's Bobotoh and/or Viking Persib Club). Influenced by the media and some individuals that want the rivalry to be preserved, many hostile incidents involving the two supporters group are still occurring even until this day.\nThere have been many events and incidents that occurred as the result of enduring hostility between these two hard-line supporters. In 2014, there had been a reconciliation held by the West Java Police to avoid unnecessary future clashes.\n\nThe rivalries with PSM Makassar is very emotional up to now and can be called the Red Derby Perserikatan recalling the Perserikatan era. \n\nPersija Jakarta's has competition with several clubs in the Perserikatan between PSM Makassar, Persebaya Surabaya, and PSMS Medan. \n\nPersija has been honoured with many titles included some international tournament titles. It makes the club as the most successful club in Indonesia history. Currently, Persija Jakarta is the title holder of Liga 1 2018 which is the highest level of Indonesia football competition.\n\n\nPersija Jakarta has been trained several times by foreign trainers, but is often trained by local coaches. Sofyan Hadi is the last coach to bring Persija Jakarta become champions as head coach and also as a player.\nWhile in 2001, Antonio Claudio also became a champion with Persija as a player and repeated that moment in 2018 as fitness coach.\n\nThis is the list of severals domestic and foreign former notable or famous players of Persija from time to time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1945845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1945845", "title": "Judicial activism", "text": "Judicial activism\n\nJudicial activism refers to Judicial philosophy that posits that the courts should go beyond the words of the constitution or a statute to consider broader societal implications of its decisions. It is sometimes used as an antonym of judicial restraint. The definition of judicial activism and the specific decisions that are activist are controversial political issues. The question of judicial activism is closely related to constitutional interpretation, statutory construction, and separation of powers.\n\nArthur Schlesinger Jr. introduced the term \"judicial activism\" in a January 1947 \"Fortune\" magazine article titled \"The Supreme Court: 1947\".\n\nThe phrase has been controversial since its beginning. An article by Craig Green, \"An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism,\" is critical of Schlesinger's use of the term; \"Schlesinger's original introduction of judicial activism was doubly blurred: not only did he fail to explain what counts as activism, he also declined to say whether activism is good or bad.\"\n\nEven before this phrase was first used, the general concept already existed. For example, Thomas Jefferson referred to the \"despotic behaviour\" of Federalist federal judges, in particular Chief Justice John Marshall.\n\nA survey of judicial review in practice during the last three decades shows that 'Judicial Activism' has characterised the decisions of the Supreme Court at different times.\n\"Black's Law Dictionary\" defines judicial activism as a \"philosophy of judicial decision-making whereby judges allow their personal views about public policy, among other factors, to guide their decisions.\"\n\nPolitical science professor Bradley Canon has posited six dimensions along which judge courts may be perceived as activist: majoritarianism, interpretive stability, interpretive fidelity, substance/democratic process, specificity of policy, and availability of an alternate policymaker. David A. Strauss has argued that judicial activism can be narrowly defined as one or more of three possible actions: overturning laws as unconstitutional, overturning judicial precedent, and ruling against a preferred interpretation of the constitution.\n\nOthers have been less confident of the term's meaning, finding it instead to be little more than a rhetorical shorthand. Kermit Roosevelt III has argued that \"in practice 'activist' turns out to be little more than a rhetorically charged shorthand for decisions the speaker disagrees with\"; likewise, the solicitor general under George W. Bush, Theodore Olson, said in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday\", in regards to a case for same-sex marriage he had successfully litigated, that \"most people use the term 'judicial activism' to explain decisions that they don't like.\" Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy has said that, \"An activist court is a court that makes a decision you don't like.\"\n\nDetractors of judicial activism charge that it usurps the power of the elected branches of government or appointed agencies, damaging the rule of law and democracy. Defenders of judicial activism say that in many cases it is a legitimate form of judicial review, and that the interpretation of the law must change with changing times.\n\nA third view is that so-called \"objective\" interpretation of the law does not exist. According to law professor Brian Z. Tamanaha, \"Throughout the so-called formalist age, it turns out, many prominent judges and jurists acknowledged that there were gaps and uncertainties in the law and that judges must sometimes make choices.\" Under this view, any judge's use of judicial discretion will necessarily be shaped by that judge's personal and professional experience and his or her views on a wide range of matters, from legal and juridical philosophy to morals and ethics. This implies a tension between granting flexibility (to enable the dispensing of justice) and placing bounds on that flexibility (to hold judges to ruling from legal grounds rather than extralegal ones).\n\nSome proponents of a stronger judiciary argue that the judiciary helps provide checks and balances and should grant itself an expanded role to counterbalance the effects of transient majoritarianism, i.e., there should be an increase in the powers of a branch of government which is not directly subject to the electorate, so that the majority cannot dominate or oppress any particular minority through its elective powers. Other scholars have proposed that judicial activism is most appropriate when it restrains the tendency of democratic majorities to act out of passion and prejudice rather than after reasoned deliberation.\n\nMoreover, they argue that the judiciary strikes down both elected and unelected official action, in some instances acts of legislative bodies reflecting the view the transient majority may have had at the moment of passage and not necessarily the view the same legislative body may have at the time the legislation is struck down. Also, the judges that are appointed are usually appointed by previously elected executive officials so that their philosophy should reflect that of those who nominated them, that an independent judiciary is a great asset to civil society since special interests are unable to dictate their version of constitutional interpretation with threat of stopping political donations.\n\nThe following rulings have been characterized as judicial activism.\n\n\nWhile the term was first coined and is often used in the United States, it has also been applied in other countries, particularly common law jurisdictions.\n\nIndia has a recent history of judicial activism, originating after the emergency in India which saw attempts by the Government to control the judiciary. Public Interest Litigation was thus an instrument devised by the courts to reach out directly to the public, and take cognizance though the litigant may not be the victim. \"Suo motu\" cognizance allows the courts to take up such cases on its own. The trend has been supported as well criticized. New York Times author Gardiner Harris sums this up as\nAll such rulings carry the force of Article 39A of the Constitution of India, although before and during the Emergency the judiciary desisted from \"wide and elastic\" interpretations, termed Austinian, because Directive Principles of State Policy are non-justiciable. This despite the constitutional provisions for judicial review and B R Ambedkar arguing in the Constituent Assembly Debates that \"judicial review, particularly writ jurisdiction, could provide quick relief against abridgment of Fundamental Rights and ought to be at the heart of the Constitution.\"\n\nFundamental Rights as enshrined in the Constitution have been subjected to wide review, and have now been said to encompass a right to privacy, right to livelihood and right to education, among others. The 'basic structure' of the Constitution has been mandated by the Supreme Court not to be alterable, notwithstanding the powers of the Legislature under Article 368. This was recognized, and deemed not applicable by the High Court of Singapore in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs.\n\nRecent examples quoted include the order to Delhi Government to convert the Auto rickshaw to CNG, a move believed to have reduced Delhi's erstwhile acute smog problem (it is now argued to be back) and contrasted with Beijing's.there are several judicial activism happening around the country like the first case itself Bihar under litigation and followed by many judicial activism spread across the country to this date\nThe Israeli approach to judicial activism has transformed significantly in the last three decades, and currently presents an especially broad version of robust judicial review and intervention. Additionally, taking into consideration the intensity of public life in Israel and the challenges that the country faces (including security threats), the case law of the Israeli Supreme Court touches on diverse and controversial public matters.\n\n\n\nGinsberg, Benjamin, et al.

O'Mahoney\n\nJoseph Christopher O'Mahoney (November 5, 1884December 1, 1962) was an American journalist, lawyer, and politician. A Democrat, he served four complete terms as a U.S. Senator from Wyoming on two occasions, first from 1934-1953 and then again from 1954-1961.\n\nOne of eleven children, Joseph O'Mahoney was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts, to Dennis and Elizabeth (née Sheehan) O'Mahoney. His parents were both Irish immigrants; his father, who came to the United States in 1861, worked as a furrier. He received his early education at the Cambridge Latin School. He attended Columbia University in New York City from 1905 until 1907, when he began a career in journalism. He was a reporter on the \"Cambridge Democrat\" before moving west to Boulder, Colorado, where he worked for the \"Herald\" (1908–1916). He married Agnes Veronica O'Leary in 1913.\n\nIn 1916, he moved to Cheyenne, Wyoming, to become city editor of the \"State Leader\", whose owner was Governor John B. Kendrick. Although he supported Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 presidential election, O'Mahoney switched to the Democratic Party the same year he joined the \"State Leader\". Governor Kendrick became a U.S. Senator in March 1917, and O'Mahoney accompanied him to Washington, D.C. as his executive secretary, a position he held for three years. While working in Washington, he studied at Georgetown University Law School and received his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1920.\n\nO'Mahoney was admitted to the bar in 1920, and subsequently returned to Cheyenne to set up his law practice. He was particularly active in legal matters stemming from the Mineral Leasing Act and, through his work, learned of impending leases on the Teapot Naval Oil Reserve; he encouraged Senator Kendrick to seek an investigation into these leases, which subsequently unearthed the Teapot Dome scandal. O'Mahoney became active in Democratic politics, serving as vice-chairman of the Wyoming Democratic Party from 1922 to 1930. He was also a delegate to the Democratic state conventions from 1924 through 1932. Representing Wyoming, he was a member of the Conference on Uniform State Laws from 1925 to 1926. He later served as city attorney of Cheyenne from 1929 to 1931.\n\nIn 1929, O'Mahoney was elected a Democratic national committeeman, serving until 1934. He was a delegate to the 1932 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois, where he was a member of the subcommittee which prepared the party's platform. After the convention, he became vice-chairman of the campaign committee. Following the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, DNC chairman James Farley was selected as U.S. Postmaster General. As a reward for his work at the 1932 convention, O'Mahoney was appointed by Farley to be the First Assistant Postmaster General, serving from March to December 1933.\n\nOn December 18, 1933, O'Mahoney was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor Leslie A. Miller to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator Kendrick. He was elected to a full six-year term in 1934, defeating Republican congressman Vincent Carter by a margin of 57%-43%. He was re-elected to a second term over Milward L. Simpson in 1940, and defeated Harry B. Henderson for a third term in 1946.\n\nDuring his early tenure in the Senate, O'Mahoney supported most of the New Deal programs, with the notable exception of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"court-packing plan.\" He earned a reputation as a strong opponent of big business and monopolies, and was heavily involved with anti-trust legislation. One of his first actions as a Senator was to introduce legislation requiring federal licensing for corporations engaged in interstate commerce. He was a leading supporter of the creation of the Temporary National Economic Committee, which he chaired from 1938 to 1941. He also supported wool, cattle, oil, and conservation legislation, and sponsored the Casper-Alcova reclamation project. He served as chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs (1943–1947), Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs (1949–1953), and co-chairman of the Joint Committee on the Economic Report (1949–1953).\n\nO'Mahoney was among twelve nominated at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to serve as Roosevelt's running mate in the presidential election that year. In 1952, as Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower won the presidential election in a landslide, O'Mahoney was narrowly defeated for re-election by Governor Frank A. Barrett by a margin of 52%-48%. He subsequently returned to the private practice of law in Wyoming. Following the suicide of Senator Lester C. Hunt in June 1954, O'Mahoney was elected the following November both to serve out Hunt's term and to a full term. He defeated Congressman William H. Harrison, the great-great-grandson of William Henry Harrison (9th President of the United States) and grandson of Benjamin Harrison (23rd President of the United States), by a margin of 51%-48%.\n\nUpon his return to the Senate, O'Mahoney became a strong opponent of the Dixon-Yates contract, which provided for a private company to build a plant to provide power to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to replace the power that the TVA sold to the Atomic Energy Commission. He sponsored legislation to require \"concentrated industries\" to give public notification and justification of price increases, to prohibit automobile manufacturers from operating finance firms, to grant Alaska and Hawaii statehood, and to require nominees for federal judgeships take an oath prior to confirmation that they would not render decisions contrary to the U.S. Constitution. His advocacy of jury trials in civil rights cases helped obtain enough votes to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1957, and he opposed the confirmation of Lewis Strauss as U.S. Secretary of Commerce. One of the last bills he introduced was to abolish the insurance rate-making body of the District of Columbia, which he believed was guaranteeing high rates to insurance companies rather than looking out for the public welfare.\n\nAfter suffering a stroke in June 1959, O'Mahoney decided not to seek re-election in 1960. He made his last speech on the Senate floor on August 29, 1960; he was brought to the floor in a wheelchair by Senator Wayne Morse, who predicted O'Mahoney would be remembered as the \"most effective and able\" Senator to try to protect free enterprise. He resumed his law practice in Washington and Cheyenne.\n\nO'Mahoney died at the Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, at age 78. He is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Cheyenne.\n\n\n"}

The verse occurs in the section introducing John the Baptist with this verse describing his clothing and diet.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 3:4\n\nBiblical scholar John Nolland notes that the decision by the author of Matthew to provide a description of John's clothing and diet shows that both are unusual and worth commenting on. That nowhere in the Gospel does the author give a description of Jesus' or his disciples' clothing thus indicates that they did not adopt any form of atypical dress.\n\nThis verse played an important role in the development of Christian monasticism, with John the Baptist viewed as a model ascetic. The sparse food and uncomfortable clothing, including the wearing of hairshirts became seen as the ideal of Christian asceticism. John Calvin wholly rejected this interpretation. He did not see this verse presenting John the Baptist as an ideal, but rather presenting an accurate portrait of one forced to live in the wilderness. To Calvin, John's holiness and popularity arose not because of his asceticism but in spite of it.\n\nThe description of John the Baptist's clothing is believed by most scholars to be a deliberate echo that of the prophet Elijah, who in is said to wear \"a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist.\" Nolland notes that nowhere outside the Gospels is camel hair mentioned as being the clothing of an ascetic. The only reference to camel hair clothing he knows of is in the Apollonius paradoxographus, which speaks of a luxurious garment made of smooth camel hair. More common for the very poor would have been clothing made of goat hair. In modern times, the Cashmere and Camel Hair Manufacturers' Institute states that \"camel hair garments are worn by native desert travelers to protect them from the heat\".\n\nJohn the Baptist's diet has been the centre of much discussion. For many years, the (\"akrides\") was interpreted as referring not to locusts, the insect, but rather to the seed pods of the carob tree. But the Greek word is not used this way, and this notion is generally rejected today. Locusts are mentioned 22 other times in the Bible and all other mentions quite clearly refer to the insect. Locusts are still commonly eaten in Arabia. Eaten either raw or roasted they are quite nutritious and a source of many vitamins. While most insects were considered unclean under Mosaic law, specifically states that locusts are permitted. Portraying John the Baptist as eating seed pods rather than insects is possibly due to squeamishness about having such a revered figure eating insects and also a belief that a true ascetic should be completely vegetarian. What is meant by honey is also disputed. While bee honey was a common food in the area at the time, Jones believes that it refers to the tree gum from the tamarisk tree, a tasteless but nutritious liquid, rather than the honey made by bees.\n"}

He grew up on his family's ranch and attended a public school in Florence, Texas until the seventh grade.\n\nIn March, 1879 he was employed by Chalres W. Wulfjen to move cattle from Texas to Wyoming. He arrived in the Wyoming Territory in August, 1879 and settled on a ranch near Sheridan, where he raised cattle as a cowboy, ranch foreman, and later cattle company owner. In 1883 he returned to Texas and bought a cattle herd to establish his ranch in Wyoming. He married Eula Wulfjen on January 20, 1891.\n\nKendrick worked as foreman for his father-in-law's cattle company from 1879 until 1883. He was employed by and invested into the Lance Creek Cattle Company and the Converse Cattle Company which he later became owner of in 1897. Kendrick became president of the First National Bank of Sheridan in 1900 and served until 1902.\n\nIn 1909 he moved to Sheridan and was elected President of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. He was a member of the Wyoming State Senate from 1910 to 1914. In 1911 he was given the Democratic Senate nomination by acclamation by other Democratic members of the legislature, but was defeated by incumbent Senator Clarence D. Clark. He was given the nomination again in 1912, but was also defeated by Senator Francis E. Warren. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from Wyoming in 1916 and 1924.\n\nHe then served as Governor of Wyoming from 1915 until he resigned in 1917, having been elected as a Democratic candidate to the United States Senate in 1916.

In 1932 he received an honorary law degree from the University of Wyoming.\n\nHe was credited with beginning the investigations into the Teapot Dome scandal, a bribery incident that took place from 1922 until 1923, and was considered as a candidate in the 1924 and 1928 presidential elections. During the 1924 presidential election, Wyoming's six Democratic delegates were instructed to vote for Kendrick at the 1924 Democratic National Convention and did so for the first three ballots. During the 1928 presidential election, he was speculated as a possible vice presidential nominee, but the nomination was later given to Senator Minority Leader Joseph Taylor Robinson at the convention.\n\nHe served as chairman of the Committee on Canadian Relations (Sixty-fifth Congress) and member of the Committee on Public Lands and Surveys (Seventy-third Congress).

{"id": "1945901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1945901", "title": "Siward, Earl of Northumbria", "text": "Siward, Earl of Northumbria\n\nSiward ( or more recently ) or Sigurd (, ) was an important earl of 11th-century northern England. The Old Norse nickname \"Digri\" and its Latin translation \"Grossus\" (\"the stout\") are given to him by near-contemporary texts. Siward was probably of Scandinavian origin, perhaps a relative of Earl Ulf, and emerged as a powerful regional strongman in England during the reign of Cnut (\"Canute the Great\", 1016–1035). Cnut was a Scandinavian ruler who conquered England in the 1010s, and Siward was one of the many Scandinavians who came to England in the aftermath of that conquest. Siward subsequently rose to become sub-ruler of most of northern England. From 1033 at the latest Siward was in control of southern Northumbria, that is, present-day Yorkshire, governing as earl on Cnut's behalf.\n\nHe entrenched his position in northern England by marrying Ælfflæd, the daughter of Ealdred, Earl of Bamburgh. After killing Ealdred's successor Eadulf in 1041, Siward gained control of all Northumbria. He exerted his power in support of Cnut's successors, kings Harthacnut and Edward, assisting them with vital military aid and counsel. He probably gained control of the middle shires of Northampton and Huntingdon by the 1050s, and there is some evidence that he spread Northumbrian control into Cumberland. In the early 1050s Earl Siward turned against the Scottish king Mac Bethad mac Findlaích (\"Macbeth\"). Despite the death of his son Osbjorn, Siward defeated Mac Bethad in battle in 1054. More than half a millennium later the adventure in Scotland earned him a place in William Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\". Siward died in 1055, leaving one son, Waltheof, who would eventually succeed to Northumbria. St Olave's church in York and nearby Heslington Hill are associated with Siward.\n\nSource material on Siward's life and career is scarce, and only a small and potentially unrepresentative amount of information exists. No contemporary or near-contemporary biography has survived, and narratives from around the time of his life such as the \"Encomium Emmae\" and the \"Vita Ædwardi Regis\" scarcely mention him; historians are therefore dependent on a few entries in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" and comparable Irish sources. Later Anglo-Norman histories may or may not be reliable depending on their source material, but useful ones include the \"Chronicle\" of John of Worcester (compiled between 1124 and 1140), William of Malmesbury (writing between c. 1125 and 1142), Henry of Huntingdon (writing between c. 1133 and 1154), and Orderic Vitalis (writing between c. 1114 and 1141). Other sources include the material attributed to Symeon of Durham (compiled and written as extant between the late 11th century and the first half of the 12th century). Legendary material, such as that in hagiography or later medieval sources such as John of Fordun or Andrew of Wyntoun, is not generally regarded as useful beyond its limited potential for cleanly preserving earlier source material.\n\nSiward's career in northern England spanned the reigns of four different monarchs. It began during the reign of Cnut, and lasted through those of Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut into the early years of Edward the Confessor. Most important was the reign of Cnut, in which so many new political figures rose to power that some historians think it comparable to the Norman conquest five decades later. These \"new men\" were military figures, usually with weak hereditary links to the West Saxon royal house that Cnut had deposed. As Cnut ruled several Scandinavian kingdoms in addition to England, power at the highest level was delegated to such strongmen. In England, it fell to a handful of newly promoted \"ealdormen\" or \"earls\", who ruled a shire or group of shires on behalf of the king. Siward was, in the words of historian Robin Fleming, \"the third man in Cnut's new triumvirate of earls\", the other two being Godwine, Earl of Wessex and Leofwine, Earl of Mercia.\n\nNorthern England in the 11th-century was a region quite distinct from the rest of the country. The former kingdom of Northumbria stretched from the Humber and Mersey estuaries, northward to the Firth of Forth, where, passing the western Kingdom of Strathclyde, it met the Kingdom of Alba (Scotland). Northumbria had been united with the West Saxon English kingdom only in the 950s, by King Eadred, and subsequent control was exerted through the agency of at least two ealdormen, one to the north and one to the south of the River Tees. The former is associated with the stronghold of Bamburgh, while the latter is associated with the great Roman city of York. It was a politically fragmented region. The western part, from Lancashire to Cumberland, was heavily settled by Norse-Gaels, while in the rest of Northumbria English and Anglo-Scandinavian regional magnates—thegns, holds and high-reeves—exercised a considerable degree of independence from the ealdormen. One such example was the magnate Thurbrand, a hold in Yorkshire, probably based in Holderness, whose family were frequently at odds with the ruling earls at Bamburgh.\n\nHistorians generally claim Siward to be of Scandinavian origin, a conclusion supported by the \"Vita Ædwardi Regis\", which states that Siward was \"[called] \"Digri\" in the Danish tongue\" (\"Danica lingua Digara\"). Legendary material incorporated in the \"Vita et passio Waldevi comitis\" (or simply \"Vita Waldevi\"), the hagiographic biography of Siward's son Waltheof, states that Siward was the son of a Scandinavian earl named Bjorn and provides a genealogy claiming that he was the descendant of a polar bear, a commonplace piece of Germanic folklore.\n\nHistorian Timothy Bolton has recently argued that the similarities between these genealogies is evidence of a shared family tradition between the descendants of Siward and Thorgil Sprakling. Bolton hypothesized that Siward's alleged father Bjorn was probably a historical figure, a brother of Thorgil Sprakling. Siward would then have been first cousin to Earl Ulf, the earl of Denmark who married Cnut's sister Estrith and founded the dynasty of Danish monarchs that eventually succeeded Cnut's. Bolton argued that the Sprakling family had only recently risen to prominence in Scandinavia, and so Siward's career in England was another indication of that family's success in Scandinavian politics.\n\nThe \"Vita Waldevi\" provides further legendary detail of Siward's journey from Scandinavia to England. According to the \"Vita\", Siward passed through Orkney, killing a dragon there before moving on to Northumbria. There he encountered another dragon, before meeting an Oðinn-like old man on a hill, who handed him a raven banner and instructed him to proceed to London to receive the patronage of the king of England.\n\nThe exact date and context of Siward's arrival in England are unknown, though the \"Vita Waldevi\" offers a legendary account. Charters dating to 1019, 1024, 1032, 1033 and 1035 mention a \"Si[ge]ward Minister\", \"the thegn Siward\", but it is impossible to securely identify any of these names with the man who became Earl of Northumbria. The earliest certain contemporary record of Siward occurs in a charter of King Cnut to Ælfric Puttoc, Archbishop of York, in 1033. This charter attestation can be identified as Siward the earl because he is styled \"dux\" (\"earl\").\n\nAlthough it is clear that Siward was earl by 1033, he may have attained the position somewhat earlier. His predecessor Erik of Hlathir last appeared in the historical sources in 1023, leaving a ten-year gap during which Siward could have taken the position. Although William of Malmesbury asserted that Erik was driven back to Scandinavia, Scandinavian tradition firmly maintained he died in England. Historian William Kapelle believed that Erik ceased to be earl in or soon after 1023, and that Carl son of Thurbrand was appointed hold or high-reeve (\"heahgerefa\") for the king in Yorkshire. Carl retained this position, it was argued, even after Siward was installed as earl a few years later, but from then on he acted as a deputy to the earl rather than to the king. Richard Fletcher remained agnostic on the point, although he did argue that Erik must have been dead by 1028. Timothy Bolton, although rejecting Kapelle's argument concerning Carl son of Thurbrand, believed Erik died c. 1023 and that the earldom may have remained vacant for a period. Bolton argued that Cnut left the earldom of Northumbria empty and appears to have paid it little attention until the last years of his reign, and another northerner Ealdred son of Uhtred rose to power in the political vacuum.\n\nWhen Cnut died in 1035, there were a number of rival claimants for his throne. These included his son Harthacnut, and the nobleman Harold Harefoot, as well as Alfred Ætheling and Edward (later, King Edward the Confessor), the exiled sons of Æthelred the Unready. Isolated in Scandinavia, Harthacnut was unable to prevent Harold Harefoot seizing the crown for himself. Ruling England from 1035, Harold died in 1040 just as Harthacnut was preparing an invasion. Arriving soon after Harold's death, Harthacnut reigned in England only two years before his own death in 1042, a death that led to the peaceful succession of Edward. Frank Barlow speculated on Siward's political stance, guessing that during these upheavals Siward assumed \"a position of benevolent or prudent neutrality\".\n\nSiward is found in 1038, as \"Sywardus Comes\" (\"Earl Siward\"), witnessing a charter of King Harthacnut to the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds. He witnessed a confirmation granted by Harthacnut to Fécamp Abbey, between 1040 and 1042, of an earlier grant made by Cnut. In 1042, he witnessed grants by Harthacnut to Abingdon Abbey and to Ælfwine, Bishop of Winchester.\n\nSiward was, at some stage, married to Ælfflæd, daughter of Ealdred II of Bamburgh, and granddaughter of Uhtred the Bold. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" asserts that, in 1041 Eadulf, Earl of Bamburgh, was \"betrayed\" by King Harthacnut. The \"betrayal\" seems to have been carried out by Siward; since when the \"Libellus de Exordio\" and other sources write about the same event, they say that Siward attacked and killed Eadulf. It was thus that Siward became earl of all Northumbria, perhaps the first person to do so since Uhtred the Bold. It is possible that Siward used Ælfflæd's lineage to claim the earldom of Bamburgh for himself, although it is unclear whether the marriage took place before or after Siward killed Eadulf. Kapelle has pointed out that no ruler of Bamburgh after Uhtred is attested at the English royal court, which he argued \"must mean they were in revolt\" against the monarchy, and that Siward's attack may therefore have been encouraged by a monarch wishing to crush a rebellious or disloyal vassal. Siward however probably had his own interests too. Killing Eadulf eliminated his main rival in the north, and the marriage associated him with the family of Uhtred the Bold, and with Uhtred's surviving son Gospatric.\n\nThere may nonetheless be a connection between the murder of Eadulf and events further south. For the same year the \"Chronicle\" of John of Worcester related that, because of an attack on two of Harthacnut's tax-collectors there, Siward took part in a reprisal on the city and monastery of Worcester. Harthacnut reigned only another year, dying on 8 June 1042. He was succeeded by the exiled English ætheling Edward. As an ætheling, a royal prince with a present or likely future claim on the throne, Edward appears to have been invited back by Harthacnut in 1041, fortuitously smoothing over the coming change in ruler. Edward was crowned king on Easter Day, 3 April 1043.\n\nRelations between Siward and King Edward appear to have been good. Neither Siward nor any associates of Siward were punished by Edward in later years. In fact, Siward appears to have been one of Edward's most powerful supporters. On 16 November 1043, Siward, along with Earls Godwine of Wessex and Leofric of Mercia, marched with King Edward against his mother, Queen Emma, helping the king to deprive the queen of her huge treasury. Edward then accused Emma of treason and deposed Stigand, Bishop of Elmham, from his position \"because he was closest to his mother's counsel\".\n\nThe Norman propagandist and historian, William of Poitiers, claimed that Siward was among those who had sworn an oath to uphold Edward the Confessor's alleged declaration that William, Duke of Normandy (later King William I), was to be his heir. Others said to have made that oath were Earls Godwine of Wessex and Leofric of Mercia, along with Stigand, who had been pardoned in 1044, and raised to Bishop of Winchester in 1047. If this did happen, it was probably during or a little before spring 1051, when Robert, Archbishop of Canterbury, was journeying to Rome for his pallium.\n\nIn 1051 Siward, along with Earls Leofric and Ralph the Timid, mobilised forces in defence of the king against a rebellion by Earl Godwine and his sons. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" relates that although Siward had to call up reinforcements, King Edward was successful and Earl Godwine was temporarily exiled. Earl Godwine remained a threat in exile, and the continued \"belligerent support\" of Siward and Leofric was thus vital to King Edward's safety. It was apparently, however, the reluctance of these two earls to fight Earl Godwine that contributed to Godwine's re-establishment in England in 1052.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that Siward extended his power southward, bringing the shire of Northampton into his control in the 1040s and the shire of Huntingdon in the 1050s. The evidence comes from royal writs addressed to Siward as earl in these shires. Siward's predecessors as earl in these areas were other Scandinavians, Thuri and Bjorn son of Earl Ulf; the former was styled \"earl of the Midlanders\" (\"comes mediterraneorum\"), showing that this earldom represented the earlier polity of the Middle Angles of Mercia. It was this area, rather than Northumbria, to which Siward's descendants were most attached.\n\nLikewise, it has been argued that Siward brought Cumberland, thought by some historians to have been lost to Strathclyde, back under Northumbrian lordship. The evidence comes from a document known to historians as \"Gospatric's Writ\". This is a written instruction, issued either by the future Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria, or Gospatric, son of Earl Uhtred, that was addressed to all Gospatric's kindred and to the notables dwelling in the \"all the lands that were Cumbrian\" (\"on eallun þam landann þeo Cōmbres\"); it ordered that one Thorfinn mac Thore be free in all things (\"þ Thorfynn mac Thore beo swa freo in eallan ðynges\") in Allerdale, and that no man is to break the peace which was given by Gospatric and Earl Siward. Historians such as Charles Phythian-Adams believed that such phraseology indicated that Siward conquered the region from its previous rulers, although others, like William Kapelle, believed that the region had come, were it ever lost, back into English power before Siward's time.\n\nA little can be said about Siward's relations with the Northumbrian church, in particular with regard to his relations with Durham. As a result of Siward's marriage to Ælfflæd, Siward gained possession of a group of estates in Teesside claimed by the bishops of Durham. Acquisition of these estates might have brought opposition from the Bishop of Durham, but Æthelric the incumbent had been expelled by the clergy of Durham in either 1045 or 1046 and, according to the \"Libellus de Exordio\", only returned by bribing Siward. According to the \"Libellus\", the clergy were \"terrified and overwhelmed by the fearful power of the earl\" and \"were compelled willy nilly to be reconciled to the bishop, and to admit him into his episcopal see\". Despite this, Siward escaped censure in the writings of later Durham monks, something which suggests relations between Siward and Durham were probably good in general.\n\nSiward can be found witnessing numerous charters during Edward's reign, though not as many as the Godwinsons; Siward usually comes third in lists of earls, behind Godwine and Leofric but ahead of Godwine's sons and the other earls. He witnessed at least seven, possibly nine, extant charters in 1044, six or seven in 1045, two in 1046, one in 1048 and one in 1049. A \"Dux\" (\"earl\") named Sihroþ and Sihroð witnessed two charters in 1050, and this may be Siward. There is another attestation in 1050, and his name appears in two dubious witness lists attached to charters dating to 1052 and 1054. Possibly Siward's last historical appearance in English legal documents is in the agreement made—probably at Lincoln—between Wulfwig, Bishop of Dorchester, and Earl Leofric, dating to between 1053 and 1055.\n\nSiward is perhaps most famous for his expedition in 1054 against Macbeth, King of Scotland, an expedition that cost Siward his eldest son, Osbjorn. The origin of Siward's conflict with the Scots is unclear. According to the \"Libellus de Exordio\", in 1039 or 1040, the Scottish king Donnchad mac Crínáin attacked northern Northumbria and besieged Durham. Within a year, Mac Bethad had deposed and killed Donnchad. The failed siege occurred a year before Siward attacked and killed Earl Eadulf of Bamburgh, and though no connection between the two events is clear it is likely that they were linked.\n\nThe \"Annals of Lindisfarne and Durham\", written in the early 12th century, relate under the year 1046 that \"Earl Siward with a great army came to Scotland, and expelled king Mac Bethad, and appointed another; but after his departure Mac Bethad recovered his kingdom\". Historian William Kapelle thought that this was a genuine event of the 1040s, related to the \"Annals of Tigernach\" entry for 1045 that reported a \"battle between the Scots\" which led to the death of Crínán of Dunkeld, Donnchad's father; Kapelle thought that Siward had tried to place Crínán's son and Donnchad's brother Maldred on the Scottish throne. Another historian, Alex Woolf, argued that the \"Annals of Lindisfarne and Durham\" entry was probably referring to the invasion of Siward in 1054, but misplaced under 1046.\n\nDuring the invasion of 1054, a battle was fought somewhere in Scotland north of the Firth of Forth, a battle known variously as the \"Battle of the Seven Sleepers\" or the \"Battle of Dunsinane\". The tradition that the battle actually took place at Dunsinane has its origins in later medieval legend. The earliest mention of Dunsinane as the location of the battle is in the early 15th century by Andrew of Wyntoun.\n\nThe earliest contemporary English account of the battle is found in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", recension D: \n\nThe battle is mentioned in the Irish annals too, briefly in the \"Annals of Tigernach\" and more extensively in the \"Annals of Ulster\":\n\nDolfin is unidentified, but may have been a relation of Mac Bethad's enemy Crínán of Dunkeld, on the basis that some of Crínán's descendants may have borne this name.\nThe purpose of Siward's invasion is unclear, but it may be related to the identity of the \"Máel Coluim\" (Malcolm) mentioned in the sources. The early 12th-century chronicle attributed to John of Worcester, probably using an earlier source, wrote that Siward defeated Mac Bethad and made \"Máel Coluim, son of the king of the Cumbrians\" a king (\"Malcolmum, regis Cumbrorum filium, ut rex jusserat, regem constituit\"). The identity of Máel Coluim and the reasons for Siward's help are controversial. The traditional historical interpretation was that \"Máel Coluim\" is Máel Coluim mac Donnchada, known sometimes today as Malcolm III or Malcolm Canmore, and that Siward was attempting to oust Mac Bethad in his favour.\n\nThe traditional historical interpretation that \"Máel Coluim\" is Máel Coluim mac Donnchada derives from the \"Chronicle\" attributed to the 14th-century chronicler of Scotland, John of Fordun, as well as from earlier sources such as William of Malmesbury. The latter reported that Mac Bethad was killed in the battle by Siward, but it is known that Mac Bethad outlived Siward by two years. A. A. M. Duncan argued in 2002 that, using the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" entry as their source, later writers innocently misidentified Máel Coluim \"son of the king of the Cumbrians\" with the later Scottish king of the same name. Duncan's argument has been supported by several subsequent historians specialising in the era, such as Richard Oram, Dauvit Broun and Alex Woolf. It has also been suggested that Máel Coluim may have been a son of the Strathclyde British king Owain Foel, perhaps by a daughter of Máel Coluim II, King of Scotland.\n\nDuncan in fact believes that the Battle of the Seven Sleepers did not lead directly to a change of leadership in the Kingdom of Scotland. It has been suggested that the chief consequence of Siward's expedition was not the overthrow of Mac Bethad, but the transfer of British territory—perhaps previously lying under Scottish suzerainty—to Northumbrian overlordship. Alex Woolf has posited that, in such a context, Máel Coluim might have been a discontented Cumbrian prince who had been forced to \"put himself under English protection\". Evidence for Northumbrian control of Strathclyde in this period includes 11th-century Northumbrian masonry found at the site of Glasgow Cathedral as well as early 12th-century claims from the archbishopric of York that Archbishop Cynesige (1051–1060) had consecrated two Bishops of Glasgow.\n\nThe 12th-century historian, Henry of Huntingdon, in his \"Historia Anglorum\", relates that when Siward was attacked by dysentery, fearing to die \"like a cow\" and wishing rather to die like a soldier, he clothed himself in armour and took to hand an axe and shield. Ennobled in such a manner, Siward died. This anecdote is of doubtful historicity, and is thought to be derived from the saga devoted to Earl Siward, now lost. The \"Vita Ædwardi Regis\" states that Siward died at York and was buried in \"the monastery of St Olaf\" at Galmanho, a claim confirmed by the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", John of Worcester, and the \"Historia Regum\".\n\nMaterial incorporated in two surviving sources is thought by some to attest to the existence of a lost saga or some other kind of literary tradition concerning Siward's life. The first source is the \"Vita et Passio Waldevi\", a hagiographic history of Siward's cult-inspiring son Waltheof. This text contains an account of Waltheof's paternal origin, and in the process recounts certain adventures of his father Siward . The second major witness of the tradition is Henry of Huntingdon's \"Historia Anglorum\", which contains extracts of saga-like material relating to Siward's invasion of Scotland (1054) and his death (1055). The Anglo-Saxonist Frank Stenton declared that Siward was \"not a statesman, but a Danish warrior of the primitive type\". Writers in the half-century after his death remembered Siward as a strong ruler who brought peace and suppressed brigandage.\n\nSiward died more than a decade before the death of Edward the Confessor, but despite this the \"Domesday Book\" recorded 4 manors, 3 in Yorkshire and 1 in Derbyshire, owned directly by Earl Siward in 1066, all of them subsequently held by Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester. This land was stated to have been worth £212, while his son Waltheof was said to have held £136 worth of land across 9 counties. Domesday records give an incomplete picture of Siward's holdings. In total it recorded property worth £348 for Siward and his son, which on its own would compare poorly with the £2493 in value recorded to have been held by the family of the earls of Mercia. Of the latter, however, Morcar of Mercia, Earl of Northumbria on the day of King Edward's death, possessed land worth £968, while Tostig, exiled earl at the time, had land worth £491; both may have come into possession of some of Siward's land in the course of becoming Earls of Northumbria. Moreover, the counties that would become Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmorland were largely omitted from the survey, while, besides being only very poorly documented, the lands in Yorkshire had been severely devastated and devalued during the Harrying of the North.\n\nSiward is said to have built a church dedicated to St Olaf at Galmanho, York. The record of his burial in this church is the only notice of a non-royal lay burial inside a church in pre-Norman England. Siward's Howe, \"i.e.\", Heslington Hill near York, was most likely named after Earl Siward, although probably because Siward held popular courts there rather than because it was his burial place.\n\nOne of Siward's sons is known to have survived him, Waltheof, whose mother was Ælfflæd. Waltheof later rose to be an earl in the East Midlands before becoming Earl of Northumbria. When Waltheof rebelled against William the Conqueror, however, the act led to his execution and to his subsequent veneration as a saint at Crowland Abbey. Waltheof's daughter married David I, King of the Scots, and through this connection Siward became one of the many ancestors of the later Scottish and British monarchs.\n\nBesides Ælfflæd, Siward is known to have been married to a woman named Godgifu, who died before Siward. The marriage is known from a grant she made of territory around Stamford, Lincolnshire, to Peterborough Abbey. Although no surviving children are attested, and no source states the name of Osbjorn's mother, this marriage has nonetheless raised the possibility that Waltheof and Osbjorn were born to different mothers, and William Kapelle suggested that Siward may have originally intended Osbjorn to inherit his southern territories while Waltheof inherited those territories in the north associated with the family of his mother Ælfflæd.\n"}

This colorless, water-soluble compound finds many applications. Sulfamic acid melts at 205 °C before decomposing at higher temperatures to water, sulfur trioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen.\n\nSulfamic acid (HNSO) may be considered an intermediate compound between sulfuric acid (HSO), and sulfamide (HNSO), effectively replacing a hydroxyl (–OH) group with an amine (–NH) group at each step. This pattern can extend no further in either direction without breaking down the sulfonyl (–SO–) moiety. Sulfamates are derivatives of sulfamic acid.\n\nSulfamic acid is produced industrially by treating urea with a mixture of sulfur trioxide and sulfuric acid (or oleum). The conversion is conducted in two stages:\n\nIn this way, approximately 96,000 tonnes were produced in 1995.\n\nThe compound is well described by the formula HNSO, not the tautomer HNSO(OH). The relevant bond distances are 1.44 Å for the S=O and 1.77 Å for the S–N. The greater length of the S–N is consistent with a single bond. Furthermore, a neutron diffraction study located the hydrogen atoms, all three of which are 1.03 Å distant from the nitrogen. In the solid state, the molecule of sulfamic acid is well described by a zwitterionic form.\n\nAqueous solutions of sulfamic acid are unstable and slowly hydrolyze to ammonium bisulfate, but the crystalline solid is indefinitely stable under ordinary storage conditions. Its behavior resembles that of urea, (HN)CO. Both feature amino groups linked to electron-withdrawing centers that can participate in delocalized bonding. Both liberate ammonia upon heating in water.\n\nSulfamic acid is a moderately strong acid, \"K\" = 0.101 (p\"K\" = 0.995). Because the solid is not hygroscopic, it is used as a standard in acidimetry (quantitative assays of acid content).\n\nDouble deprotonation can be effected in ammonia solution to give the anion .\n\nWith nitrous acid, sulfamic acid reacts to give nitrogen:\nwhile with nitric acid, it affords nitrous oxide:\n\nThe reaction of excess hypochlorite ions with sulfamic acid or a sulfamate salt gives rise reversibly to both \"N\"-chlorosulfamate and \"N\",\"N\"-dichlorosulfamate ions.\n\nConsequently, sulfamic acid is used as hypochlorite scavenger in the oxidation of aldehydes with chlorite such as the Pinnick oxidation.\n\nUpon heating sulfamic acid will react with alcohols to form the corresponding organosulfates. It is more expensive than other reagents for doing this, such as chlorosulfonic acid or oleum, but is also significantly milder and will not sulfonate aromatic rings. Products are produced as their ammonium salts. Such reactions can be catalyzed by the presence of urea.\n\nSulfamic acid is mainly a precursor to sweet-tasting compounds. Reaction with cyclohexylamine followed by addition of NaOH gives CHNHSONa, sodium cyclamate. Related compounds are also sweeteners, such as acesulfame potassium.\n\nSulfamates have been used in the design of many types of therapeutic agents such as antibiotics, nucleoside/nucleotide human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase inhibitors, HIV protease inhibitors (PIs), anticancer drugs (steroid sulfatase and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors), antiepileptic drugs, and weight loss drugs.\n\nSulfamic acid is used as an acidic cleaning agent, sometimes pure or as a component of proprietary mixtures, typically for metals and ceramics. It is frequently used for removing rust and limescale, replacing the more volatile and irritating hydrochloric acid, which is cheaper. It is often a component of household descaling agents, for example, Lime-A-Way Thick Gel contains up to 8% sulfamic acid and has pH 2.0–2.2, or detergents used for removal of limescale. When compared to most of the common strong mineral acids, sulfamic acid has desirable water descaling properties, low volatility, and low toxicity. It forms water-soluble salts of calcium and ferric iron.\n\nSulfamic acid is preferable to hydrochloric acid in household use, due to its intrinsic safety. If erroneously mixed with hypochlorite based products such as bleach, it does not form chlorine gas, whereas the most common acids would; the reaction (neutralization) with ammonia, produces a salt, as depicted in the section above.\n\nIt also finds applications in the industrial cleaning of dairy and brewhouse equipment. Although it is considered less corrosive than hydrochloric acid, corrosion inhibitors are often added to the commercial cleansers of which it is a component. It can be used for descaling home coffee and espresso machines and in denture cleaners.\n\n\nAccording to the label on the consumer product, the liquid silver cleaning product TarnX contains thiourea, a detergent, and sulfamic acid.\n\n"}

The School also houses a School for Advanced Studies and a Gifted/High Ability Magnet.\n\nDesigned by architect George M. Lindsey in the Collegiate Gothic style, and constructed in 1930, John Marshall High School first opened its doors on January 26, 1931, with approximately 1200 students and 48 teachers. Joseph Sniffen, for whom the auditorium was named, served as the Principal, while Hugh Boyd and Geraldine Keith acted as Marshall's first Vice-Principals. The football field was named in Boyd's honor, while the library was named for Keith.\n\nDuring the first semester of the school's existence, the faculty and students cooperatively selected the school motto, seal, and colors. The school motto, \"Veritas Vincit\" (Truth Conquers...), was an easy choice since this was a favorite sentiment of John Marshall. The school seal shows an open Book of Learning, behind which is projected the scales of justice with \"Veritas Vincit\" emblazoned on the bar. Two shades of blue became the official colors of the high school; the moonlight blue of midnight and the sunlight blue of dawn. Since the color blue is symbolic of truth, the choice of colors harmonized with the school's motto. John Montapert and Henry Suykida, two Marshall students who graduated in the Winter Class of 1939, composed \"Alma Mater\", the official school song.\n\nThe school's mascot is the \"Barrister.\" The school's service organization is the Continentals. A bust of John Marshall stands in the center of the Senior Court.\n\nFollowing the Sylmar earthquake of 1971, some of Marshall's buildings were condemned. The cafeteria was torn down, but the Los Feliz community, led by \"Citizens to Save Marshall\" activists Sherril Boller, Joanne Gabrielson, Alberta Burke, and Nina Mohi, tirelessly campaigned to save the unique Collegiate Gothic Main Building. In 1975, this building was closed for structural strengthening and all classes moved to temporary bungalows. In September 1980 the refurbished Main Building was opened. A new building now houses the library, cafeteria, and science classrooms. Mike Haynes Stadium, the school's football, and track stadium, also dates to 1981.\n\nToday, Marshall has an enrollment of approximately 2,400 students and a teaching staff of 106.\n\n\n"}

She formally trained in Russia and Germany before moving to France and expanding her practice to include textile, fashion, and set design. She co-founded the Orphism art movement, noted for its use of strong colours and geometric shapes, with her husband Robert Delaunay and others. She was the first living female artist to have a retrospective exhibition at the Louvre in 1964, and in 1975 was named an officer of the French Legion of Honor.\n\nHer work in modern design included the concepts of geometric abstraction, and the integration of furniture, fabrics, wall coverings, and clothing into her art practice.\n\nSarah Ilinitchna Stern was most likely born on 14 November 1885 in Hradyzk, Ukraine (today Poltava Oblast) then part of the Russian Empire. Her father was foreman of a nail factory. At a young age she moved to St. Petersburg, where she was cared for by her mother's brother, Henri Terk. Henri, a successful and affluent lawyer, and his wife Anna wanted to adopt her but her mother would not allow it. Finally in 1890 she was adopted by the Terks. She assumed the name Sonia Terk and received a privileged upbringing with the Terks. They spent their summers in Finland and traveled widely in Europe, introducing Sonia to art museums and galleries. When she was 16, she attended a well-regarded secondary school in St. Petersburg, where her skill at drawing was noted by her teacher. When she was 18, at her teacher's suggestion, she was sent to art school in Germany where she attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Karlsruhe. She studied in Germany until 1905 and then moved to Paris.\n\nWhen she arrived in Paris she enrolled at the Académie de La Palette in Montparnasse. Unhappy with the mode of teaching, which she thought was too critical, she spent less time at the Académie and more time in galleries around Paris. Her own work during this period was strongly influenced by the art she was viewing including the post-impressionist art of Van Gogh, Gauguin and Henri Rousseau and the Fauves including Matisse and Derain. In 1908 she entered into a \"marriage of convenience\" with German art dealer and gallery owner Wilhelm Uhde, allowing her access to her dowery and Uhde cover for his homosexuality. Sonia Terk gained entrance into the art world via exhibitions at Uhde's gallery and benefited from his connections.\n\nComtesse de Rose, mother of Robert Delaunay, was a regular visitor to Uhde's gallery, sometimes accompanied by her son. Sonia Terk met Robert Delaunay in early 1909. They became lovers in April of that year and it was decided that she and Uhde should divorce. The divorce was finalised in August 1910. Sonia was pregnant and she and Robert married on November 15, 1910. Their son Charles was born on January 18, 1911.<ref name=\"Baron/Damase: p20\">Baron/Damase: p. 20</ref> They were supported by an allowance sent from Sonia's aunt in St. Petersburg.<ref name=\"Sonia Delaunay/Jacques Damase: p31\">Sonia Delaunay/Jacques Damase: p. 31</ref>\n\nSonia said about Robert: \"In Robert Delaunay I found a poet. A poet who wrote not with words but with colours\".\n\nIn 1911, Sonia Delaunay made a patchwork quilt for Charles's crib, which is now in the collection of the Musée National d'Art Moderne in Paris. This quilt was created spontaneously and uses geometry and colour.\n\n\"About 1911 I had the idea of making for my son, who had just been born, a blanket composed of bits of fabric like those I had seen in the houses of Ukrainian peasants. When it was finished, the arrangement of the pieces of material seemed to me to evoke cubist conceptions and we then tried to apply the same process to other objects and paintings.\" Sonia Delaunay\n\nContemporary art critics recognize this as the point where she moved away from perspective and naturalism in her art. Around the same time, cubist works were being shown in Paris and Robert had been studying the colour theories of Michel Eugène Chevreul; they called their experiments with colour in art and design \"simultanéisme\". Simultaneous design occurs when one design, when placed next to another, affects both; this is similar to the theory of colours (Pointillism, as used by e.g. Georges Seurat) in which primary colour dots placed next to each other are \"mixed\" by the eye and affect each other. Sonia's first large-scale painting in this style was \"Bal Bullier\" (1912–13), a painting known for both its use of colour and movement.\nThe Delaunays' friend, the poet and art critic Guillaume Apollinaire, coined the term Orphism to describe the Delaunays' version of Cubism in 1913. It was through Apollinaire that in 1912 Sonia met the poet Blaise Cendrars who was to become her friend and collaborator. Sonia Delaunay described in an interview that the discovery of Cendrars' work “gave me [her] a push, a shock.” She illustrated Cendrars' poem \"La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France\" (\"Prose of the Trans-Siberian and of Little Jehanne of France\") about a journey on the Trans-Siberian Railway, by creating a 2m-long accordion-pleated book. Using simultaneous design principles the book merged text and design. The book, which was sold almost entirely by subscription, created a stir amongst Paris critics. The simultaneous book was later shown at the Autumn Salon in Berlin in 1913, along with paintings and other applied artworks such as dresses, and it is said that Paul Klee was so impressed with her use of squares in her binding of Cendrars' poem that they became an enduring feature in his own work.\n\nThe Delaunays travelled to Spain in 1914, staying with friends in Madrid. At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Sonia and Robert were staying in Hondarribia, in the Basque Country, with their son still in Madrid. They decided not to return to France. In August 1915 they moved to Portugal where they shared a home with Samuel Halpert and Eduardo Viana. They discussed an artistic partnership with Viana and their friends Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso, whom the Delaunays had already met in Paris, and José de Almada Negreiros. In Portugal she painted \"Marché au Minho\" (\"Market in Minho\", 1916), which she later says was \"inspired by the beauty of the country\". Sonia had a solo exhibition in Stockholm (1916).\nThe Russian Revolution brought an end to the financial support Sonia received from her family in Russia, and a different source of income was needed. In 1917 the Delaunays met Sergei Diaghilev in Madrid. Sonia designed costumes for his production of \"Cleopatra\" (stage design by Robert Delaunay) and for the performance of Aida in Barcelona. In Madrid she decorated the \"Petit Casino\" (a nightclub) and founded \"Casa Sonia\", selling her designs for interior decoration and fashion, with a branch in Bilbao. She was the center of a Madrid Salon.\n\nSonia Delaunay travelled to Paris twice in 1920 looking for opportunities in the fashion business, and in August she wrote a letter to Paul Poiret stating she wanted to expand her business and include some of his designs. Poiret declined, claiming she had copied designs from his \"Ateliers de Martine\" and was married to a French deserter (Robert). Galerie der Sturm in Berlin showed works by Sonia and Robert from their Portuguese period the same year.\n\nSonia, Robert and their son Charles returned to Paris permanently in 1921 and moved into Boulevard Malesherbes 19. The Delaunays' most acute financial problems were solved when they sold Henri Rousseau's \"La Charmeuse de serpents\" (\"The Snake Charmer\") to Jacques Doucet. Sonia Delaunay made clothes for private clients and friends, and in 1923 created fifty fabric designs using geometrical shapes and bold colours, commissioned by a manufacturer from Lyon. Soon after, she started her own business and \"simultané\" became her registered trademark.\n\nFor the 1923 staging of Tristan Tzaras play \"Le Cœur à Gaz\" she designed the set and costumes. In 1924 she opened a fashion studio together with Jacques Heim. Her customers included Nancy Cunard, Gloria Swanson, Lucienne Bogaert and Gabrielle Dorziat.\n\nWith Heim she had a pavilion at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes, called \"boutique simultané\". Sonia Delaunay gave a lecture at the Sorbonne on the influence of painting on fashion.\n\nSonia designed costumes for two films: \"Le Vertige\" directed by Marcel L'Herbier and \"Le p'tit Parigot\", directed by René Le Somptier, and designed some furniture for the set of the 1929 film Parce que je t'aime (\"Because I love you\"). During this period, she also designed haute couture textiles for Robert Perrier, while participating actively in his artistic salon, R-26. The Great Depression caused a decline in business. After closing her business, Sonia Delaunay returned to painting, but she still designed for Jacques Heim, Metz & Co, Perrier and private clients. She said \"the depression liberated her from business\". 1935 the Delaunays moved to rue Saint-Simon 16.\n\nBy the end of 1934 Sonia was working on designs for the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne, for which she and Robert worked together on decorating two pavilions: the \"Pavillon des Chemins de Fer\" and the \"Palais de l'Air\". Sonia however did not want to be part of the contract for the commission, but chose to help Robert if she wanted. She said \"I am free and mean to remain so.\" The murals and painted panels for the exhibition were executed by fifty artists including Albert Gleizes, Léopold Survage, Jacques Villon, Roger Bissière and Jean Crotti.\n\nRobert Delaunay died of cancer in October 1941.\n\nAfter the second world war, Sonia was a board member of the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles for several years. Sonia and her son Charles in 1964 donated 114 works by Sonia and Robert to the Musée National d'Art Moderne. Alberto Magnelli told her \"she and Braque were the only living painters to have been shown at the Louvre\". In 1966 she published \"Rythmes-Couleurs\" (colour-rhythms), with 11 of her gouaches reproduced as pochoirs and texts by Jacques Damase, and in 1969 \"Robes poèmes\" (poem-dresses), also with texts by Jacques Damase containing 27 pochoirs. For Matra, she decorated a Matra 530. In 1975 Sonia was named an officer of the French Legion of Honor. From 1976 she developed a range of textiles, tableware and jewellery with French company Artcurial, inspired by her work from the 1920s. Her autobiography, \"Nous irons jusqu'au soleil\" (\"We shall go up to the sun\") was published in 1978.\nIn 1967 (February 25 - April 5) she was a part of an exhibition of artist-decorated cars entitled 'Cinq voitures personnalis\"é\"es par cinq artistes contemporains' ('Five Cars Personalized by Five Contemporary Artists') organized by the journal R\"é\"alités as a fundraiser for French medical research. She designed the pattern for a Matra 530 by experimenting with optical effects causing the car to recompose the pattern into a light blue shade when in motion 'so as not to attract other drivers' attention to the point of causing accidents through distraction.'\n\nSonia Delaunay died December 5, 1979, in Paris, aged 94. She was buried in Gambais, next to Robert Delaunay's grave.\n\nHer son, Charles Delaunay, became an expert in jazz music during the 1930s. He was a jazz critic, organizer of jazz concerts and a founder of the Hot Club of France (the first jazz club in France) and the first editor of \"Jazz Hot Magazine\", the club's official publication.\n\nDelaunay's painting \"Coccinelle\" was featured on a stamp jointly released by the French Post Office, La Poste and the United Kingdom's Royal Mail in 2004 to commemorate the centenary of the Entente Cordiale.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1945955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1945955", "title": "Lea Rosh", "text": "Lea Rosh\n\nLea Rosh (; born Edith Renate Ursula Rosh on 1 October 1936 in Berlin) is a German television journalist, publicist, entrepreneur and political activist. Rosh was the first female journalist to manage a public broadcasting service in Germany and in the 1970s the first anchorwoman of Kennzeichen D, a major political television program. She has been a member of the SPD since 1968.\n\nRosh has received major public awards (e.g. the Bundesverdienstkreuz), and is a controversial and influential figure in the local political scene of Berlin. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin is seen as her main and personal achievement.\n\nRosh was born in Berlin in 1936. Her mother's father was a Jewish court singer. Her father was killed in the winter of 1944 as a Wehrmacht soldier in Poland. At age 18 she left the Lutheran Church in Germany, she describes herself as an atheist. She began to use the first name \"Lea\" instead of her given name of Edith, describing the name Edith, which is of Old English origin, as \"horribly German\".\n\nRosh worked at various German radio and television services, including the Sender Freies Berlin and the ZDF. From 1991 to 1997 she was appointed director of the Hannover studio of the Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), being the first woman to hold a comparable post in the history of German broadcasting.\n\nMotivated by historian Eberhard Jäckel, she was one of the primary forces who lobbied from 1988 onwards for over 17 years for the construction of the widely controversial Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, completed in May 2005. She has been chairman of the „Förderkreis zur Errichtung eines Denkmals für die ermordeten Juden Europas“ (\"Society for the Promotion of Raising a Monument to the Murdered Jews of Europe\") since 1995, and vice chairman of the board of trustees of the „Stiftung Denkmal für die ermordeten Juden Europas“ (\"Foundation for the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe\") since 1999.\n\nIn 1990, Rosh and Eberhard Jäckel were awarded the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis for their joint work, \"Der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschland\". In 2006, Rosh was awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz.\n\nLea Rosh's husband died in 2008. The late Jakob Schulze-Rohr was an architect and building contractor in Berlin and a brother of the film director Peter Schulze-Rohr. \n\nSince 2007 Lea Rosh has held a post as a lecturer at the \"University of Management and Communication (FH) Potsdam\" in the fields of Moderating and Media training.\n\nMichael Naumann first had opted against the Berlin Holocaust Monument and (similar to the less known Eike Geisel) had interpreted the attempts as a \"self finding process\" of the German Bourgeoisie and a \"hidden conclusion\" (heimlicher Schlußstrich) of the Vergangenheitsbewältigung. While, according to Naumann, after 1871 the leading class in the German Empire manifested their historical views in raising retrospective monuments like the Hermannsdenkmal and Völkerschlachtdenkmal and joined in a controversial debate abaout the planned reconstruction of Heidelberg Castle, the Berlin Republic would use the debates around the Holocaustmahnmal and the reconstruction of Berliner Stadtschloss for a similar purpose with Lea Rosh being a leading figure in both cases.\n\nAccording to Claus Leggewie, beyond a 'selbsttherapeutisches Lebenswerk' (lit. 'self-therapeutic life's work') Rosh's monumental work resulted in a symbol of national identity of her generation as well the Berlin capital. Instead of reflection and insecurity in the face of (especially around Berlin) decaying authentic memorial sites, Rosh's initiative initiated a higher self-consciousness and pride of the \"World Masters of Remembering\" ('Gedenkweltmeister') involved. Rosh's attempts however result in a possibly exclusive stance against Germans with a migration background which do not share the same history.\n\nWhen at the Holocaust monument's dedication on 10 May 2005, Rosh held up a molar tooth which she had retrieved from Belzec concentration camp in 1988, promising to place it in a column at the memorial, the act outraged several prominent German Jewish leaders, notably Paul Spiegel, the then chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, who described the idea as \"irreverent\". Rosh withdrew her plan and returned the molar to Belzec concentration camp shortly after.\n\nIn 2003, Rosh was elected \"most embarrassing Berliner of the year\" (\"peinlichste Berlinerin\") by the readers of Berlin city magazine\" Tip.\"\n\nClaus Leggewie criticized her very strongly for \"running over\" (\"... überrollt hat\") any resistance against \"her\" monument and for leaving all those who put forward \"professionally, pedagogically and aesthetically sound arguments\" against her monumental project bereft of nerves, voice, reputation and good faith.\n\nThe sociologist Y. Michal Bodemann has criticized Rosh as an example of \"professional pseudo Jews\", that is non-Jews \"who over-identify with Judaism.\"\n\n"}

For Dawkins, the meme exemplified another self-replicating unit with potential significance in explaining human behavior and cultural evolution: the effect a meme has on society is based on the application of the meme after understanding the qualities essential to the meme. According to the theory, memetic engineering is, simply put, the analysis of an individual or individuals' behavior, the selection of specific memes and the distribution or propagation of those memes with the intent of altering the behavior of others. A memetic engineer doesn't particularly have to consciously make the decision to alter another individuals behavior. It can happen unconsciously when specific behavior is observed, transmitted and then replicated within the observer. Memes themselves are neither good nor bad. For example, \"racism\" is an ideology that is made up of several memes. When a meme is introduced, those concepts begin to take on their own process of evolution based on the person who adopts the ideology, internalizes it, and reintroduces it into society causing it to spread like a virus.\n\nAccording to the above theory, typical memetic engineers include scientists, engineers, industrial designers, ad-men, artists, publicists, political activists, and religious missionaries.\n\nDawkins agrees that much of theology and other theoretical aspects of religion can be viewed as the careful, even worshipful, handling of extremely powerful memeplexes with very odd or difficult traits.\n\nMemetic Engineering developed from diverse influences, including cutting-edge physics of consciousness and memetics research, chaos theory, semiotics, culture jamming, military information warfare, and the viral texts of iconoclasts William S. Burroughs, J.G. Ballard, and Genesis P-Orridge. It draws upon Third Culture sciences and conceptual worldviews for Social Engineering, Values Systems Alignment, and Culture Jamming purposes. An important example of macro-historical memetic engineering analysis explaining how domination, patriarchy, war and violence are culturally programmed is Riane Eisler's \"The Chalice and the Blade\" (San Francisco: Harper SanFrancisco, 1988), which outlines her Dominator and Partnership Culture thesis. The savvy memetic engineer is able to isolate, study, and subtly manipulate the underlying values systems, symbolic balance and primal atavisms that unconsciously influence the individual psyche and collective identity. A highly educated but susceptible intelligentsia, worldwide travel, and information vectors like the Internet, cable television, and tabloid media, means that hysterical epidemics and disinformation campaigns may become more common. This warfare will be conducted using aesthetics, symbols, and doctrines as camouflage that will ultimately influence our cultural meme pool. These contemporary life conditions (Historic Times; Geographic Place; Existential Problems; and Societal Circumstances) are explored in books like Carl Sagan's \"The Demon Haunted World: Science As a Candle in the Dark\" (New York: Ballantine Books, 1996), John Brockman's \"The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution\" (New York: Touchstone Books, 1996), and Michael Shermer's \"Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudo-science, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time\" (New York: W.H. Freeman & Co, 1996). Fictional descriptions of memetic engineering include Isaac Asimov's seminal \"Foundation\" Trilogy (New York: Bantam Books, 1991), George Gurdjieff's artificial mythology \"Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson\" (New York: Penguin USA, 1999); Neil Stephenson's novels \"Snow Crash\" (New York: Bantam Spectra, 1993) and \"The Diamond Age\" (New York: Bantam Spectra, 1996); and Robert W. Chambers' unearthly \"The King in Yellow\" (Buccaneer Books, 1996) tome, which influenced seminal horror author H. P. Lovecraft.\n\nMemetic engineering as a social science lends examples of itself in multiple areas and disciplines. It is currently being examined and researched by the US military as a means to counter insurgency and combat terrorism as explained below in \"From the Clash to the Confluence of Civilizations\" by Thomas P.M. Barnett, an American military geostrategist, and Richard J. Pech's \"Inhibiting Imitative Terrorism Through Memetic Engineering\".\n\nOther examples of applied memetic engineering are present but not exclusive to the marketing and advertising industries. The question is whether these individuals can be truly considered memetic engineers. Marketing and advertising professionals create memes on an ongoing basis; however, this alone doesn't necessarily qualify them as being memetic engineers. Few if any actually fall into this category. This is possibly due to a lack of understanding of the various memes that have taken root in their target audience minds. According to the definition, industrial designers, musicians, artists, athletes, and other entertainers would more likely better serve this definition. This is because of their ability to create products, phrases and ideas that disseminate the population triggering a response within the brain causing a cultural phenomena.\n\nGame theory provides an empirical means of advancing the science of memetics. Memetic game theory, attempts to mathematically capture behavior in strategic situations; where an individual's success in making choices depends on the choices of others, based on past experiences, emotional behavior and learned behavior. It also offers a scientific approach to analyzing social interactions.\n\nAn example of an engineered meme is Godwin's law, a meme which propagates on mail-lists, and which its author professes to have initiated to reduce spam on those lists; one version is \"When someone posts a metaphor about Nazis the thread is no longer useful.\"\n\nRichard Pech discusses the concept of memetic engineering within the context of countering mind contagions associated with terrorism. School shootings, for example, may be explained as an attempt to demonstrate the ultimate form of rebellion against a system in which the perpetrators feel ostracised or isolated. Acts of violence might appeal to their egos and the means for achieving this is replicated via the shooting meme. To re-engineer such a meme and its ability to infest susceptible minds, all information concerning such violence must be portrayed in an unappealing manner. For example, no one wants to be associated with acts of cowardice. By strongly suggesting that such violence is cowardly and the work of disturbed minds, it has less appeal for replication. In this manner the shooting meme has been re-engineered by removing its attraction, and therefore removing its ability to replicate.\n\n\n"}

The Rímac River marks its natural border with downtown Lima and Callao province's district of Carmen de la Legua Reynoso on the south; while the Chillón River, on the north, marks San Martín de Porres' border with Ventanilla, also in Callao, and Puente Piedra.\n\nSince 1945, continuous invasions of territory in what was then part of the Carabayllo District ended up in the creation of the Distrito Obrero Industrial 27 de Octubre on May 22, 1950, which is still celebrated as the district's anniversary.

{"id": "1945969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1945969", "title": "Mimic (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)", "text": "Mimic (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)\n\nIn the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" fantasy role-playing game, the mimic is a type of fictional monster. It is portrayed as being able to change its shape to disguise its body as an inanimate object, commonly a chest. The mimic has a powerful adhesive that holds fast to creatures that touch it, allowing the mimic to beat its victims with its powerful pseudopods. The mimic was introduced in the first edition \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" game's original \"Monster Manual\". The mimic has appeared in subsequent editions. Several variants of the creature have been introduced, with a variety of abilities and sizes.\n\nThe mimic made its first appearance in the original \"Monster Manual\" (1977), by Gary Gygax. This book described mimics as \"subterranean creatures which cannot stand the light of the sun. They are able to perfectly mimic stone or wood.\" According to the book, mimics thus pose as items such as stonework, doors, or chests; when a character or creature touches the disguised mimic, the mimic can lash out with a bludgeoning pseudopod. A mimic excretes an adhesive glue to hold fast whatever touches it. The book states that all mimics move about constantly in search of prey. Mimics are described as neutral in alignment.\n\nThe \"Monster Manual\" mentions that there are two types of mimic encountered in the game. The slightly smaller version is more intelligent, and is generally friendly if offered food, usually telling a player character about what it has seen nearby. These creatures have their own language and can usually speak several other tongues. The book described the larger variety of mimic as a carnivorous creature called a \"killer mimic\". This creature does not speak, and will attack anything which is nearby. The \"Monster Manual\" was reviewed by Don Turnbull in the British magazine \"White Dwarf\" No. 8 (August/September 1978). As part of his review, Turnbull comments on several new monsters introduced in the book, referring to the mimic as a thing which adventurers from his Greenlands dungeon \"are not going to be best placed to meet\".\n\nThe July 1983 issue of \"Dragon\" magazine (No. 75) featured the article \"The Ecology of the Mimic\", by Ed Greenwood. This article provides additional in-game descriptions of the mimic, with the information purported as having come from \"the Journals of Maerlun the Scholar\". The article states that a mimic's hide is naturally gray in hue, with a smooth very hard outer skin that appears stone-like; a mimic is able to change the color and texture of its outer surface to resemble wood-grain by shifting a brown pigmented liquid between its interior and exterior body cells to fill the many capillaries lying just beneath the skin surface, while the creature can empty these capillaries to revert to its normal stone-like appearance. A mimic is amorphous, able to alter the external configuration of its form at will, and the more intelligent ones can even assume the shape of a partition wall, overhanging arch, or rough rock wall; this feat is accomplished by the creature's mode of travel, which involves extending its strong pseudopods, which exude a sticky \"glue\", and pulling itself along (\"unsticking\" its own glue at will), traveling on walls and ceilings as easily as it can on floors. The article also describes how a mimic observes its surroundings through its very sensitive \"eyespots\" (patches of pigment that are sensitive to heat, light, and vibration) all over its skin; bright sunlight effectively blinds a mimic by overwhelming these sensory spots, which is why mimics are almost always found in areas where the sun never reaches. Austin Wood of PC Gamer described Greenwood's article as \"probably the closest thing to science to ever come out of D&D\".\n\nThe monster collection \"Creature Catalog III\" in \"Dragon\" No. 101 (September 1985) featured a creature by contributor Gregory Detwiler known as the metal mimic. The entry states that a metal mimic is a more powerful relative of the \"ordinary\" mimic, with all of the mimic's basic abilities and characteristics, but being able to imitate metal, in addition to being able to imitate wood and stone. The metal mimic can take on the shape and appearance of items of any raw or finished metal, which includes the color, luster, and texture of any pure metal (such as iron, gold, silver, or platinum) except for adamantite, but cannot form into any alloy. A metal mimic can also create a magical illumination from itself or from any nearby object. A metal mimic can exude a pseudopod in the form of a sword or dagger; such extremities will appear to be a valuable enchanted blade, to lure prey. According to this entry, metal mimics come in two types: the larger, non-belligerent type which may be willing to negotiate for food, and the smaller \"killer mimic\" which is instinctively aggressive.\n\n\"Dungeon\" magazine No. 19 (October 1989) includes the adventure scenario \"The Vanishing Village\", by Marcus Rowland, which features the \"house hunters\"; these creatures are described in the adventure synopsis as \"gigantic relatives of mimics, able to imitate cottages and other buildings up to the size of a small inn or temple.\"\n\nThe mimic first appeared for second edition \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" in the second volume of the \"Monstrous Compendium\" series (1989). In this set, the creature is described as magically-created, and usually appears in the form of a treasure chest, although its natural color is a speckled grey that resembles granite. The entry notes that a mimic can alter its pigmentation to resemble varieties of stone (including marble), and various metals (including gold, silver, and copper); a mimic cannot lose mass in this transformation, but may radically alter its dimensions. This entry reveals the in-game origin of the mimic: \"Mimics were originally created by wizards to protect themselves from treasure hunters\"; the language spoken by the smaller variety of mimic, also known as the common mimic, is a corruption of the original language spoken by their wizard creators. Mimics have no moral code and are sometimes difficult to employ as guardians; the killer mimic is neutral in alignment like the common mimic, but has a tendency towards evil. The entry also notes that alcohol will weaken a mimic's glue, and that the mimic may neutralize the glue at any time; a mimic is also immune to acid attacks and is unaffected by molds, green slime, and various pudding monsters. The mimic's entry is reprinted in the \"Monstrous Manual\" (1993).\n\nThe space mimic appeared in the Spelljammer appendix for the \"Monstrous Compendium\" series (1990); the introduction credits Bruce Heard with the creature's design. These creatures inhabit the setting's \"wildspace\" between planetary bodies, and were created by wizards for use in long journeys, but proved unreliable servants and were discarded. A space mimic's natural skin is described as \"pitch black, with small specks of twinkling light, imitating a space background,\" and the creature is about the same size as a common mimic. A space mimic may pass as ship debris floating in wildspace, or as an elaborate desk with books and scrolls on an abandoned ship, and can resemble a piece of furniture of any variety of wood, stone, or metal. A space mimic has two eyes, which are normally hidden under thick eyelids. A space mimic also has the innate ability to cast spells as if it were an illusionist, and the creature has an interest in magic as well as food. The entry states that a space mimic will use its magic to become invisible and hypnotize a wizard, levitating itself to lure him somewhere alone, then steal his books, scrolls, and magic items before eating the victim.\n\nAnother mimic variant appears in the Forgotten Realms setting boxed set, \"\" (1994), in the set's 16-page Monstrous Compendium booklet. Stated to be found only in the setting's Undermountain thus far, the greater mimic is vastly larger than a common mimic and can cover a whole room or a small building such as a tomb; the largest known specimen can cover a cubic area. A greater mimic has a higher intelligence than a common mimic, and a limited resistance to magic, and \"can alter its coloring and shape to imitate a vast number of textures, colors, and shapes at once... [creating] entire rooms of furniture, treasure and tapestries.\" A greater mimic can block a corridor and alter its shape to become a room with entrance doors on either side, so that its prey walks directly into it; a greater mimic will always use enticements such as simulated treasure or furniture to lure prey, and will wait until an entire group enters before attacking. A greater mimic will then release its natural adhesive across all its surfaces and attack by slamming the walls of its structure together. A minority of greater mimics can develop an ability to display illusory creatures inside itself, pretending to speak through these creatures' mouths. This mutation of the common mimic, according to its entry in this boxed set, is presumed to be the result of either a mimic having lived for a century and grown to great size, or perhaps a mimic altered by the strange magic of Undermountain and the wizards that reside there. A greater mimic is unlikely to obey a wizard, although Halaster is able to use these creatures as guards and barriers against adventurers. A greater mimic has limited mobility to due its size, and will usually settle in one place. A greater mimic makes pacts with other local creatures for food, but can sustain itself on little or no food for long periods of time if need be; a greater mimic has a prodigious appetite, however, and does not practice conservation if a steady supply of food is available. A greater mimic appears in this boxed set's \"Campaign Guide\" booklet, as part of the \"Muiral's Gauntlet\" scenario, living in an abandoned drow complex. When encountered by player characters, this greater mimic covers most of the floor in an apparent storeroom filled with boxes of coins and valuables; if it appears to be losing a fight against the characters, it will negotiate, trading information for its life. The greater mimic's entry is reprinted in the \"Monstrous Compendium Annual Two\" (1995), although no mention is made there of Undermountain.\n\nAll three varieties of the house hunter mimic appear for the game's second edition in the \"Monstrous Compendium Annual One\" (1994).\n\nThe mimic appears in the \"Monster Manual\" (2000) for the game's third edition. In this edition, the mimic is given the aberration creature type. This book describes mimics as \"strange and deadly creatures that can change their pigmentation and shape. They use this ability to lure hapless victims close enough to slay.\" This book notes that a weapon striking a mimic becomes stuck to the creature's thick, slimy adhesive, though the weapon can be pried off.

He is a world expert on plant lectins, authoring 270 papers and three books on the subject.\n\nIn 1998, Árpád Pusztai publicly announced that the results of his research showed feeding genetically modified potatoes to rats had negative effects on their stomach lining and immune system. This led to scientific criticism. Pusztai was suspended and his annual contract was not renewed. The resulting controversy became known as the Pusztai affair.\n\nÁrpád János Pusztai was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 8 September 1930. He was student of the high school called Óbudai Árpád Gimnázium, and later obtained a diploma in chemistry in 1953 from the Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest. He worked for three years as an associate scientist at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences before the Hungarian revolution against Soviet control in 1956. After the failed revolution Árpád Pusztai escaped to a refugee camp in Austria and from there made his way to England. He completed his doctorate in biochemistry at the Lister Institute in London and continued there with his post-doctorate. In 1963 he was invited to join the Protein Research Department at the Rowett Research Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland. Pusztai worked at the Rowett Institute for the next 36 years, predominately studying plant lectins. During that time he discovered glycoproteins in plants, authored over 270 research papers, published 3 books and was considered an \"internationally renowned expert on lectins\". He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1988 and has received fellowships from the Leverhulme Trust. Árpád Pusztai is married to Dr Susan Bardócz, a colleague he met at the Rowett Institute. He has two daughters from his first marriage.\n\nIn 1995 Árpád Pusztai began research on genetically modified potatoes containing the GNA lectin gene from the snowdrop plant. His group fed rats on raw and cooked genetically modified potatoes, using Desiree Red potatoes as controls. In 1998 Árpád Pusztai said in an interview on a World in Action programme that his group had observed damage to the intestines and immune systems of rats fed the genetically modified potatoes. He also said, \"If I had the choice I would certainly not eat it,\" and that, \"I find it's very unfair to use our fellow citizens as guinea pigs.\"\n\nThis resulted in a media frenzy, and Rowett Institute's director Philip James, after initially supporting Pusztai, suspended him and banned both Pusztai and Susan Bardocz from speaking publicly. He also used misconduct procedures to seize the raw data. The Rowett Institute eventually published an audit criticizing Pusztai's results and sent the raw data to six anonymous reviewers who also criticized Pusztai's work. Pusztai sent the audit report and his rebuttal to scientists who requested it, and in February 1999, twenty-one European and American scientists released a memo supporting Pusztai.\n\nPusztai's experiment was eventually published as a letter in \"The Lancet\" in 1999. Because of the controversial nature of his research the letter was reviewed by six reviewers - three times the usual number. One publicly opposed the letter, another thought it was flawed, but wanted it published \"to avoid suspicions of a conspiracy against Pusztai and to give colleagues a chance to see the data for themselves,\" while the other four raised questions that were addressed by the authors. The letter reported significant differences between the thickness of the gut epithelium of rats fed genetically modified potatoes, compared to those fed the control diet.\n\nThe Royal Society of Medicine declared that the study ‘is flawed in many aspects of design, execution and analysis’ and that ‘no conclusions should be drawn from it’. For example, too few rats per test group were used to derive meaningful, statistically significant data.\n\nHe was one of several scientists interviewed in the 2010 documentary who, based on their findings, have criticized the use of genetic modification for food.\n\nPusztai's annual contract at Rowett was not renewed following the incident and he moved back to Hungary. He has been giving lectures on his GE potato work and on claimed dangers in general of genetic engineering of crop plants. In 2005, he received the Whistleblower Award from the German Section of the International Association of Lawyers against Nuclear Arms (IALANA) and the Federation of German Scientists (VDW). In 2009, Pusztai and his wife Prof. Bardócz Zsuzsa received the Stuttgart peace prize (Stuttgarter Friedenspreis).\n\n\n"}

It is a dark, heavy bread which is often bought sliced, in varieties from light-coloured rye, to very dark, and refined to whole grain. It forms the basis of \"smørrebrød\", which is closely related to the Swedish \"smörgås\". Some toppings are served on \"franskbrød\" (lit. \"French bread\"), a very light, crusty wheat bread. The bread is usually buttered, though for some variants, a spread of lard is customary.\n\nTraditional toppings include pickled herrings (plain, spiced or curried), slightly sweeter than Dutch or German herrings; thinly sliced cheese in many varieties; sliced cucumber, tomato and boiled eggs; pork liver-paste; dozens of types of cured or processed meat in thin slices, or smoked fish such as salmon; mackerel in tomato sauce; pickled cucumber; boiled egg, and rings of red onion. Mayonnaise mixed with peas, sliced boiled asparagus and diced carrot, called \"italiensk salat\" (lit. \"Italian salad\", so named because the colours match the Italian flag), remoulade or other thick sauces often top the layered open sandwich, which is usually eaten with utensils. It is custom to pass the dish of sliced breads around the table, and then to pass around each dish of toppings, and people help themselves.\n\nMore festive meals can be loosely divided into courses: Fish toppings first (such as herring, shrimp, or smoked salmon) followed by cold cuts and salads, and finally cheese with bread or crackers and a little fruit. One or several warm dishes are often served with the meats on special occasions, for example: breaded plaice filet, fried \"medister\" sausage, \"frikadeller\" with pickled red cabbage, or \"mørbradbøf\" (pork tenderloin with sauteed onions or a creamy mushroom sauce). Toppings change with the seasons and some are mostly associated with Easter or Christmas lunches, like head cheese and \"æbleflæsk\" (lit. \"apple pork\", roast pork or bacon in apple sauce). Summer offers lighter fare such as smoked mackerel, \"sommersalat\" (lit. \"summer salad\", radish and cucumber in a smoked cheese dressing), new potatoes, and freshly peeled shrimp.\n\nHundreds of combinations and varieties of \"smørrebrød\" are available, and some traditional examples include:\n\n\nA lavish piece of restaurant \"smørrebrød\" can almost be a meal unto itself, whereas everyday toppings are much simpler and often ungarnished.\n\n\n"}

The companies completed the programs in the middle of the 2000-2009 decade, with a cut-off of availability to customers in 2007 or 2008 (Customers who did not act on the program must now bear the full cost of service improvement).\n\nThe process leading to SIP actually had its origins with an application on October 15, 1996 by Sprint Canada (owned by Call-Net) for an order by the CRTC to Northwestel to interconnect for long-distance service. On February 28, 1997, the CRTC denied the application, but started a public proceeding to determine if NorthwesTel's service area should have long-distance competition.\n\nAs a result of public hearings during 1997 on the issue, it became evident to the CRTC that there were locations that considered their phone service to be inferior. The CRTC issued Public Notice 97-42, Service to High Cost Serving Areas (PN 97-42). The objective was to hold hearings across Canada to determine a definition of basic service and to define high cost serving areas.\n\nThe CRTC held regional consultations on the issues of PN 97-42 in eight locations from Whitehorse, Yukon to Deer Lake, Newfoundland and Labrador during May and June 1998, and received comments and submissions from the public, telephone companies and other organizations. In some locations, video conferencing or audio conferencing brought additional communities into the regional consultations.\n\nOn October 19, 1999, the CRTC issued Telecom Decision 99-16], defining basic service as including security features such as Caller ID, local dial-up connectivity to the Internet, access to long-distance service, among other things. The CRTC also found that Northwestel's operating area was entirely a high-cost serving area, and that supplementary funding may be required to raise the level of phone service and to maintain that service in the face of competition.\n\nMost incumbent local exchange carrier phone companies in Canada were ordered to submit Service Improvement Plans in order to bring all of their customers up to the basic service objective, and to provide service to unserved customers. Among the companies affected by this order were Northwestel, Bell Canada, Telus, MTS of Manitoba, NewTel of Newfoundland, SaskTel of Saskatchewan and Telebec of Quebec.\n\nProjects covered by the Service Improvement Plan included upgrade of long-distance circuits (often outdated microwave lines), replacement of central office equipment (again, often outdated), replacement of assorted radio telephone service technologies with wireline service or fixed radio link wireless services providing direct dial capability, and extension of service to unserved customers, again, with wireline or fixed radio link wireless services.\n\nCost sharing was a feature of the program. The benefitting customer paid a portion of the charges, usually the first $1,000 of usually the first $25,000. If the cost exceeded $25,000 to serve a customer, the customer was usually responsible to pay $1,000 plus any cost that exceeded $25,000. Such high cost was rare, and usually only occurred where the telephone company needed to install new microwave relay towers to service the customer.\n\nThe telephone companies typically phased the program over several years, usually no more than four, with the focus on improving service to the larger groups of customers first, and providing new service to larger groups of unserved customers first.\n\nIn the case of Northwestel, the four-year program involved distributing the project over the four jurisdictions the company's operating area covered: northern British Columbia, Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.\n\nOne small effect of the program was to better define ILEC service territories in rural areas that had not previously been served. For example, Northwestel and Telus more clearly defined the service boundary between Wonowon and Fort St. John, British Columbia.\n\nThe Fort Fitzgerald, Alberta area was transferred to Northwestel as a result of an order in 2003, since it could be served by Northwestel at a much lower cost than by Telus. Fort Fitzgerald was a minor contentious issue with Telus, as Northwestel claimed it did not serve Alberta, while Telus stated that Northwestel did have some customers in Alberta, possibly having been served by the Fort Smith Telephone Company before it was sold in 1964 to the predecessor of Northwestel.\n\nNorthwestel was required to file its SIP by January 31, 2000, a year before the requirement on the other companies.\n\nThe plan largely consisted of replacing equipment in exchanges and on long-distance networks. This equipment was mostly manufacturer-discontinued, or no longer supported, but the equipment continued to meet the company's operational requirements. Much of this equipment was on routes and in communities where economic activity would not generate the revenue required to replace the equipment, without carrying loans over an extremely long period of time. This had the effect that a market case could not be generated to gain shareholder (Bell Canada) approval to spend the limited capital funding to replace it with modern equipment.\n\nThe original planned cost was $76 million. The CRTC cut the program to $67 million, eliminating a plan for local dial-up Internet access in small communities, and also removing Caller ID as part of the basic service objective within the Northwestel operating area. Many existing exchanges cannot support Caller ID, but the only reason to replace them was to provide this feature, therefore, the CRTC ruled that the cost was too high.\n\nIn 2003, however, at the company's request, the CRTC reviewed the issue of local access to the Internet, found that other Internet service providers had not expanded service to unserved communities, and authorized Northwestel to provide the service, under the SIP program, to any small community that did not already have a local provider.\n\nAn effort in 2002–2003 to have Caller ID covered under the program, in response to community demands for its safety features, was also refused. However, four fairly large communities were allowed to have the cost included under the program, since the CRTC decided the market conditions were favourable in those four locations.\n\nOne of the key elements of the SIP program for Northwestel was the provision of new and improved service to customer premises. Numerous rural areas had no wireline service, and the few customers in those subdivisions with service had some form of wireless service, cellular when possible, manual radio telephone service elsewhere. Some customers could not use any wireless service, even satellite phones, due to their location in a gully with a hill to the south.\n\nThe SIP program focused on providing wireline, where feasible, to these areas. As the program met these needs, existing customers served by party line service, or private lines with a long reach back to the central office, were next to be upgraded. (Such long lines had a resultant hum on the line caused by amplifiers. They also had low fax/modem speeds due to signal attenuation.) Finally, individual isolated customers requiring fixed radio link services were to be provided service.\n\nAll three aspects — exchange replacement, long-distance route improvement and customer premises connections — were spread over the four-year phasing of the program of the 2001 planning year to the 2004 planning year. Work continued into 2007.\n"}

The film follows two men who form an unlikely friendship as they care for two women who are both in comas. The film's themes include bodily autonomy and violation, the boundary between life and death, versions of love predicated on possession, and gender, gaze, voyeurism, passivity, agency, complicity, obsession, and psychoanalysis.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success, winning the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language and the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film while Almodóvar won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. It is now generally regarded as one of the best films of the 2000s.\n\nThe story unfolds in flashbacks, giving details of two separate relationships that become intertwined with each other.\n\nDuring a performance of \"Café Müller\", a dance-theatre piece by Pina Bausch, Benigno Martín and Marco Zuluaga cross paths, but the two men are no more than strangers. Still, Benigno notices that Marco cries.\n\nMarco is a journalist and travel writer who happens to see a TV interview with Lydia González, a famous matador. He thinks that an article on her would be interesting and, on the instructions of his editor, he contacts her in a bar, where she asks him to take her to her house. As they talk, she elaborates on the fact that she broke up with her boyfriend “el Niño de Valencia”, another matador, something that has been all over the tabloids. As Marco confesses that he knows nothing of bullfighting and that he is a journalist, she becomes angry and leaves his car without saying a word. As he drives off, he hears a scream inside her house and stops; Lydia rushes off and climbs back into his car: she asks him to kill a snake that she found in her house. He does so and comes out of the house crying. With that new confidence established between them, they become friends and, later on, lovers. Marco attends a wedding in Toledo and is surprised to find Lydia there too, since she had said that she did not want to go. The wedding turns out to be that of Marco's former fiancée, Ángela, who had the same phobia of snakes as Lydia; Marco was very much in love with Ángela and had a very hard time getting over her (which was the reason for his constant crying over things he could not share with her). Lydia says that she has something important to say, but she prefers to wait until after the bullfight that afternoon; but she is gored and becomes comatose. Marco does not leave her side at the hospital and finally befriends Benigno, who recognizes him from the dance-theatre performance. Marco is told by the doctors that people in a coma never wake up and that, while there are miracle-stories of people who have come back, he should not keep his hopes high.\n\nBenigno is a personal nurse and caregiver for Alicia Roncero, a beautiful dance student, who lies in a coma, but Benigno sees her as alive; he talks his heart out to her, and brings her all kinds of dancing and silent black and white film mementos. As it turns out, Benigno had been obsessed with Alicia for a while, before she was in a coma, since his apartment is in front of the dance studio where she practiced every day. At first his obsession was only from a distance, since Benigno was taking care of his possessive mother, who seemed to be immobile. For that reason, he became a nurse and also a beautician. Free to move about after his mother dies, he finally picks up the courage to talk to Alicia, after she dropped her wallet on the street. As they walk together to her house, they talk about her discovery of silent black and white films and about dancing. When she walks into her building, Benigno notices that she lives in the house of Dr. Roncero, who is a psychiatrist. Benigno makes an appointment to see the doctor and talks about his unresolved bereavement grief over his mother. But it is all a ruse to gain access to the apartment, where he steals a hair-clip from Alicia's room. That night, Alicia is run over by a car and becomes comatose. By mere chance, Benigno is assigned to Alicia, much to the surprise of her father. But since Benigno's services are the best, he hires him and a colleague permanently to tend for Alicia. Benigno also tells Dr. Roncero that he is gay, possibly so that Alicia's father will not suspect his love for her, or possibly so that he will not question Benigno's particular attachment to her.\n\nBenigno keeps telling Marco that he should talk to Lydia because, despite the fact that they are in a coma, women understand and react to men's problems. Eventually, Marco learns from “el Niño de Valencia” that Lydia and him had decided to be together again, and that she intended to tell Marco. \nSo Marco finds himself alone again. As he is about to leave, he comes into Alicia's room, looking for Benigno, but he instead finds himself opening his heart out to her, despite his scepticism over Benigno's theories. Benigno and Marco leave the hospital and, in the parking lot, Benigno tells Marco of his plans to marry Alicia: Marco is taken aback, telling his friend that Alicia is basically dead and cannot express her will in any manner. But Benigno does not hear any reason. During a routine review at the hospital, the supervisors notice that Alicia has missed several periods; since this is a common occurrence with people in a coma, they do not think twice over it. In reality, Alicia was raped months before and is pregnant, Benigno is the main suspect and is later sent to prison.\n\nMarco has left Spain to write a book about travelling. Months later, in Jordan, he reads in a newspaper that Lydia has finally died, having never awakened from her coma. He phones the hospital, looking for Benigno, only to hear that Benigno does not work there any more. Marco manages to talk to another nurse whom he had befriended; she tells him that Benigno is now in prison for the alleged rape of Alicia. Marco returns to Spain and visits Benigno, who asks him to hire a new lawyer and find out what happened to Alicia. Marco stays in Benigno's apartment and sees that Alicia has awakened during or after delivering a stillborn baby. Following the urging of Benigno's lawyer, Marco does not tell Benigno about Alicia's unexpected recovery. Desperate, Benigno writes a farewell letter to Marco and takes a large quantity of pills, to try to \"escape\" into a coma, thus reuniting with Alicia. He dies of an overdose.\n\nMeanwhile, Alicia has begun rehabilitation to recover her ability to walk and dance. The film ends in the same theatre where it began, where Marco and Alicia meet by chance.\n\n\n\"Talk to Her\" received positive reviews, as it currently holds a 92% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes; the consensus states: \"Another masterful, compassionate work from Pedro Almodóvar\". On Metacritic, which uses an average of critics' reviews, the film holds an 86/100, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Despite the film's success, \"Talk to Her\" wasn't submitted as Spain's pick for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. \"Mondays in the Sun\" was selected instead.\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing $9,285,469 in the United States and $41,716,081 internationally for a worldwide total of $51,001,550.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, \"Time\" magazine film critics Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel included \"Talk to Her\" in their list of the All-TIME 100 Greatest Movies. Paul Schrader also placed the film at #46 on his canon of the 60 greatest films. In a 2016 BBC poll, critics voted the film the 28th greatest since 2000.\n\n"}

In 1943, he represented Winnipeg and the Winnipeg Trades and Labour Council at the Convention of the American Federation of Labour. In the same year, he was elected secretary-treasurer of the Manitoba CCF. He served on the board of directors of the Winnipeg Musicians Union, the Executive Committee of Family Bureau, and the Advisory Board of the Manitoba Department of Education.\n\nOriginally a farmer after moving to Canada, Swailes later became a member of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Hugh Ross and Bernard Naylor. He became Secretary of the Musicians' Union in 1934.\n\nHe was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1945, for the Winnipeg constituency. At the time, Winnipeg elected ten members by a single transferable ballot. Swailes finished thirteenth on the first count, but was declared elected to the seventh position on the thirteenth count following transfers from other CCF candidates. Swailes was an important organizer for the CCF in this campaign, working with David Lewis and Lloyd Stinson.\n\nWinnipeg's electoral map was redrawn for the 1949 provincial election. Swailes ran for re-election in the Winnipeg Centre constituency, which elected four members via a single transferable ballot. He finished in second place, and was declared elected on the first count. In the 1953 election, he was re-elected at the top of the poll.\n\nSwailes ran for Mayor of Winnipeg in 1948 losing to Garnet Coulter. He ran again in 1952, but finished third against Coulter and Stephen Juba.\n\nWinnipeg abandoned multi-member constituencies for the 1958 provincial election and Swailes was re-elected in the constituency of Assiniboia, defeated Progressive Conservative George William Johnson by 131 votes. Assiniboia was a marginal seat, and Swailes had little assistance from party headquarters in this campaign. He was defeated in the 1959 election, losing to Johnson by 217 votes.\n\nSwailes was elected to the Winnipeg city council later in 1959, and served for over a decade. He attempted a comeback at the provincial level in the 1962 provincial election, running in Winnipeg Centre as a candidate of the New Democratic Party (which replaced the CCF in 1961). He finished a surprisingly poor third against Progressive Conservative James Cowan, but was re-elected in the third ward of Winnipeg's City Council in 1963.\n\nFormer CCF leader Lloyd Stinson once described Swailes as \"the hardest worker on the opposition side\". He was active in many issues, and often criticized the Douglas Campbell administration for its conservatism.\n\nHe died in Victoria, British Columbia at the age of 92.\n\nSwailes's brother, Robert Swailes, was a parliamentarian in British Columbia.\n"}

Through the theorem, it is readily demonstrable that a function such as the exponential function must be a transcendental function. \n\nSuppose therefore that\n\nis a formal power series with rational coefficients \"a\", which has a non-zero radius of convergence in the complex plane, and within it represents an analytic function that is in fact an algebraic function. Then Eisenstein's theorem states that there exists an integer \"A\", such that \"A\"\"a\" are all integers.\n\nThis has an interpretation in terms of p-adic numbers: with an appropriate extension of the idea, the \"p\"-adic radius of convergence of the series is at least 1, for almost all \"p\" (i.e. the primes outside the finite set \"S\"). In fact that statement is a little weaker, in that it disregards any initial partial sum of the series, in a way that may \"vary\" according to \"p\". For the other primes the radius is non-zero.\n\nEisenstein's original paper is the short communication\n\"Über eine allgemeine Eigenschaft der Reihen-Entwicklungen aller algebraischen Functionen\"\n(1852), reproduced in Mathematische Gesammelte Werke, Band II, Chelsea Publishing Co., New York, 1975,\np. 765–767.\n\nMore recently, many authors have investigated precise and effective bounds quantifying the above almost all.\nSee, e.g., Sections 11.4 and 11.55 of the book by E.

Based on the manga and anime series \"YuYu Hakusho\" created by Yoshihiro Togashi, the plot follows the central character Yusuke Urameshi, a street-brawling, often truant teenager who dies trying to save a young boy's life. After meeting an incarnation of the Grim Reaper, Yusuke is given a second chance at life as a \"Spirit Detective\", a protector of the living world.\n\n\"Spirit Detective\" is an action-adventure game that retells the various events of the anime's story arc of the same name. The player takes control of one of six characters from the series and must complete various objectives from collecting items and completing mazes to battling enemies and occasional bosses. \"Spirit Detective\" was co-developed by Sensory Sweep Studios and Screaming Games as part of a western region publishing deal from Atari. \"Spirit Detective\" is the first \"Yu Yu Hakusho\" game that never saw the release in Japan.\n\nCritical reception for \"Spirit Detective\" has been mostly unfavorable. While separate reviewers had their own qualms about the game, nearly all complained of monotonous gameplay and boring visuals.\n\n\"Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective\" is based on the manga and anime series \"YuYu Hakusho\" by author Yoshihiro Togashi. The plot follows Yusuke Urameshi, a 14-year-old with a bad attitude and a tendency for truancy and street fighting. One day, Yusuke spots a child playing with a ball in the street, the protagonist pushes the child out of the way of a speeding car, only to be struck and killed himself. Yusuke's ghost is suddenly greeted by Botan, a cute girl who introduces herself as the Grim Reaper. She informs Yusuke that, due to his noble actions, he will be given a second chance at life as a “Spirit Detective”, an investigator of cases involving apparitions and demons on Earth. \"Spirit Detective\" retells events from the anime's initial story arc of the same name, consisting of the show's first 25 episodes.\n\n\"Spirit Detective\" is an action-adventure game in which the player must complete various storyline scenarios using one of six characters at any given time. The player is able to move freely within the game's maze-like environments and is guided to specific objectives using a compass, located at the top of the screen. Objectives include picking up items or engaging in battle with foes. Combat consists of hand-to-hand or melee attacks, as well as special spirit abilities unique to four of the protagonists (Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, and Hiei). The player's health, spirit energy, and experience are represented by gauges. Items that refill health and spirit energy may be found strewn throughout many of the levels. Defeating enemies will reveal orbs that can be collected for experience. If enough of them are picked up, the character's health, spirit energy, and strength will increase. Although most levels require the use of one particular character, later levels allow the player to switch among the four aforementioned heroes.\n\n\"Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective\" was developed by the US company Sensory Sweep Studios in association with Screaming Games. Before its development, a multitude of licensed video games based on \"Yu Yu Hakusho\" were released in Japan during the anime television series’ original airing. The anime began its broadcast in North America in 2002, gaining popularity on the afternoon Cartoon Network block Toonami. In June 2003, the gaming company Atari and Funimation Entertainment, the English licensor for the \"YuYu Hakusho\" anime, established a publishing agreement for video games in western regions. \"Spirit Detective\" for the GBA is the first \"Yu Yu Hakusho\" game title in this deal. The two companies had found previous success with another Funimation license, \"Dragon Ball Z\".\n\n\"Spirit Detective\" is Sensory Sweep's first published game. According to the company's Devon Hargraves, a team of 15 individuals took about five months to develop \"Spirit Detective\". Although were not given a lot of time to adjust their engine, the team attempted to include all aspects of the Spirit Detective saga. Hargraves acted as a “jack-of-a-trades” designer for the game, working on the design documentation, giving game ideas and feedback, designing levels, and writing part of the script. Screaming Games had a more indirect involvement with the game's development by helping Sensory Sweep and Atari “line up” and “flesh out the project and all of the documentation”. \"Spirit Detective\" was officially announced by Atari in August 2003. The game was released in North America on December 9, 2003 and in Europe on April 1, 2005. \"Spirit Detective\" was later released in a double-pack with in North America on November 3, 2006.\n\nThe game received \"unfavorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. One universal complaint about the game was the very repetitive and thus unenjoyable nature of the gameplay. Adam Tierney of IGN lambasting the combat with enemy AI, the required use of the compass in the maze-like levels, and the discouragement of exploration. Eduardo Zacarias of GameZone found that the battles become “more of a nuisance rather than an entertaining challenge”; he did credit the developer's attempt at variety with the unique objectives in each stage. Nintendo World Report writer Michael Cole chose \"Spirit Detective\" among the worst games he has played, noting poor collision detection, significant lag when using special attacks, and virtually no challenge in its battles or collection missions. Cole was satisfied with the integration of episode plot devices into the levels and the inclusion of minigames.\n\nMost critics disapproved of the graphics in \"Spirit Detective\", while opinions about other aspects of the presentation have been largely mixed. Tierney called the backgrounds “dull” and “bland”, the looping music “weak”, and static menus “bland”. However, he did take pleasure in the pre-rendered models and the clever text used in the storyline adaptation. Contrarily, Cole thought the plot “flows like a low-budget clip show”, requiring the player to be familiar with the anime and allegedly neither introducing characters and situations in a proper fashion nor including all portions of the story arc. Like Tierney, Zacarias was unmoved by the graphics and accompanying music, but was impressed by the fighting animation and sound effects. Cole described the use of official in-game artwork as a plus, but remarked the audio as “horrible”.\n\nDespite the game's poor critical reception, Atari's North American division reported satisfying financial results for its third quarter of 2003, naming \"Spirit Detective\" as one of the contributing titles. Sensory Sweep Studios and Screaming Games collaborated once more for the release of \"\" for the GBA in 2004.\n"}
{"id": "1946059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946059", "title": "Death of a Princess", "text": "Death of a Princess\n\nDeath of a Princess is a British 1980 drama-documentary produced by ATV in cooperation with WGBH in the United States. The drama is based on the true story of Princess Mishaal, a young Saudi Arabian princess and her lover who had been publicly executed for adultery. Its depiction of the customs of Saudi Arabia led some Middle Eastern governments to oppose its broadcast under threat of damaging trade relations.\n\nThe film was based on numerous interviews by journalist Antony Thomas, who, upon first hearing the story, grew passionately curious about its veracity, soon drawing upon contacts in the Arab world for their insights and opinions. Because of the candid and sometimes critical nature of the interviews, Thomas and ATV executives decided not to make the film as a straight documentary but instead to dramatise it with actors.\n\nThomas himself was played by Paul Freeman under the name \"Christopher Ryder\". The identities of the interviewees were obscured, and the actors chosen to replace them were based only loosely on their subjects. The character of Elsa Gruber, played by Judy Parfitt, was based on Rosemarie Buschow, a German woman who had worked for the Saudi Royal Family as a nanny.\n\nThere was only one exception, an Arab family who played themselves. The fictitious nation in which the drama was set was called \"Arabia\", which some viewers took to mean Saudi Arabia. The name of the princess was never said.\n\n\"Death of a Princess\" depicts Thomas' focus on \"the Princess\", as her story became his vehicle through which important facets of Islamic culture in Saudi Arabia were revealed, including traditions and customs as well as gender roles and sexuality. Thomas later explained that he had only reconstructed scenes where he was confident that they did happen, although he included film of interviewees telling him information which he did not believe.\n\nA critically acclaimed film shown on ITV in the United Kingdom on 9 April 1980, it provoked an angry response from the Saudi government. While resisting pressure not to show the film, ATV agreed to include an introductory comment that said:\n\nThe programme you are about to see is a dramatized reconstruction of certain events which took place in the Arab world between 1976 and 1978. We have been asked to point out that equality for all before the law is regarded as paramount in the Moslem world.\n\nThe British ambassador to Riyadh, James Craig, was asked to leave the country, while restrictions were placed on the issuing of visas to British businessmen. Saudi Arabia, along with Lebanon, banned British Airways' Concorde from its airspace, making its flights between London and Singapore unprofitable. While the Saudi response had initially driven a UK press reaction against the attempted censorship, when export orders began to be cancelled, the press began to question whether it had been right to show the film. British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington found the film \"deeply offensive\", he \"wished it had never been shown\", but \"to ban a film because we do not like it or even because it hurts our friends\" was not an option for the country's government.\nSimilarly, the US government received enormous political pressure from Saudi Arabia to censor its broadcast. On 8 May 1980, Mobil Oil placed an advertisement in \"The New York Times\" and other newspapers condemning the film, which it described as \"a new fairy tale\". It quoted a letter to the \"New Statesman\" by Penelope Mortimer, who had worked with Thomas on the film:\n\nWith the exception of Barry Millner, who had already sold his story to the \"Daily Express\", Rosemary [sic] Buschow, and the Palestinian family in Beirut, every interview and every character in the film is fabricated. The \"revelation\" of the domestic lives of the Saudi princesses—man-hunting in the desert, rendezvous in boutiques—was taken entirely on the evidence of an expatriate divorcée, as was the story of the princess first seeing her lover on Saudi television. No real effort was made to check up on such information. Rumour and opinion somehow came to be presented as fact... the audience, foolishly believing it to be authentic, is conned.\n\nWhile Buschow had advised Thomas on the making of the film, she later told the Associated Press that it should not have been made, adding that \"it achieved nothing but discord... every family has a black sheep, and this is a large family of around 5,000 people\".\n\nAfter some stalling, it was eventually broadcast by the PBS programme \"World\" in most of the US on 12 May 1980, with only 16 out of 200 PBS stations choosing not do so. In one example, South Carolina Educational Television canceled the broadcast of the film across its network, a decision influenced by fact that the then-U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, John C. West, had formerly been the state's Governor.\n\nIn the Netherlands, NOS showed the programme, with the broadcaster claiming that there had been \"no controversy about it here\" and that it had not been contacted by the Saudi Government. However, in Sweden, the rights were bought, at a premium, by a video company, Scanvideo, which decided that the economy \"would suffer great harm if it were shown, and decided that it must not be shown\". By contrast, the film was shown in neighbouring Norway by public broadcaster NRK.\n\nIn Australia, the programme was shown on the Seven Network, although the acting Prime Minister, Doug Anthony, asked the channel not to show it, as it might jeopardise trade deals with Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries. He denounced the film as \"grossly offensive to the Saudi Arabian Royal Family and government\". The Cattlemen's Union of Australia also campaigned against the film being shown, with its executive director arguing that it was \"stupid to risk future trade relations, job opportunities and export income for a brief period of sick entertainment\". After the screening of the programme, Australian businesses reported delays in obtaining visas for Saudi Arabia as a result.\n\nAs a result of playing the role of the Princess, Egyptian actress Suzanne Abou Taleb, according to \"People\" magazine, \"was put on a blacklist by Egyptian TV, film and theatre producers, who are dependent on Saudi petrodollars\". The measure had exactly the opposite of its intended effect, increasing her public prominence and she became one of the most popular actresses in Egypt, under the name Sawsan Badr. Paul Freeman's performance as Christopher Ryder was seen by Steven Spielberg, who noted his piercing eyes; this observation led to his casting as René Belloq in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\".\n\nIn a retrospective interview for the \"Frontline\" rebroadcast, Thomas described his reasons for making the film:\n\nI set off to investigate this story with the idea of doing it as a drama, and gradually I realized that something completely different was developing. Where I traveled through the Arab world, the story was celebrated. Everyone had their own version of that story, all very, very different. ... Whoever I spoke to—whether they were Palestinians, whether they were conservative Saudis, whether they were radicals—they attached themselves to this princess. She'd become a myth. And they identified with her, and they kind of co-opted her to their cause. People were discussing things with me about their private lives, about their sexual feelings, about their political frustrations, that they'd never discussed with me before. ...Somehow this princess was sort of like a catalyst. And after thinking about it seriously, I thought, my gosh, this is perhaps an even more interesting story to tell.\n\nIn Edward Said's book \"Covering Islam\", he discusses the release of \"Death of Princess\" and the Saudi response. He argues that although the Saudis opposed the showing of the film and used their money to try and coerce PBS from televising it, they lacked the cultural capital that the West had over representation of Muslims in the media. Naturally, the Saudis opposed it for its implications of Saudi royal family corruption, but also because it only reinforced images of Sharia law that Westerners understand—punishment.\n\nThe film has never been broadcast again in the UK, although there was a private screening at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2009. It was re-broadcast in the US by \"Frontline\" in April 2005, for its 25th anniversary. This was under limited terms described in its original contract, meaning that because of copyright and issues with royalties, it is not available for Internet viewing through PBS.\n\n\n"}

The club was formed in 2005 by some supporters of the original SV (Austria) Salzburg after it was renamed FC Red Bull Salzburg by its new owners, who also changed the club's colours from its traditional violet and white to red and white. The club commenced participation in the seventh tier of Austria's national league system in 2006, then rose through four successive championships to the third tier, Regionalliga West, in 2010. In 2015, the club gained promotion to the Erste Liga, one tier below the Austrian Bundesliga, only to be relegated a year later.\n\nThe original club was formed in 1933. It was subject to a takeover by the Red Bull company in 2005. They renamed the club FC Red Bull Salzburg, changed the team colours and claimed that it was a new team. As a concession to pleas to keep the old colours, Red Bull offered to allow the goalkeeper's socks to be purple for away matches. This was viewed as an insult by fans caused a group of supporters, known as the \"Violet-Whites\", to want to preserve the 72-year-old traditions of their club which they felt had been ignored by Red Bull.\n\nOn 7 October 2005, the Violet-Whites successfully registered the old club's original name \"SV Austria Salzburg\" and the old club emblem. For the second half of the 2005–06 season SV Austria fielded a unified team with the football section of the \"PSV Schwarz-Weiß Salzburg\", which played in the \"1. Salzburg Landesliga\", the fourth tier of Austrian football, but at the end of the season the PSV members voted against continuing the link. Thus, the Violet-Whites formed a completely new team, which entered 2. Klasse Nord, the seventh tier of Austrian football, for the 2006–07 season.\n\nThe first match of the relaunched SV Austria Salzburg was played on 29 July 2006 against \"Lieferinger SV\", another Salzburg football club. SV Austria Salzburg won 6–0, and went on to win the championship and promotion to 1. Klasse Nord. This was the first of four successive championships & promotions for SV Austria Salzburg. They won the \"1. Klasse Nord\" in 2007–08, the \"2. Salzburg Landesliga\" in 2008–09 and the \"1. Landesliga\" in 2009–10. The latter secured the club's promotion to Austria's third tier of football, the \"Regionalliga West\" for the 2010–11 season. The club finished fifth in the 2010–2011 season, and eighth in the 2011–2012 season.\n\nIn the 2014–15 season, the club was promoted to the First League, the second tier of Austrian football, by winning the Regionalliga West, after a change in the rules that see an automatic promotion place for one of the Regionalligas being rotated each season.\n\nThe promotion to the First League forced the club into debt of €900,000 by November 2015, caused by an increased budget for the players as well as a security requirement to holding certain home games without spectators. The club indicated it was willing to sell up to 51 percent of its ownership of the team to an investor, as long as its name, colours, and crest would not be altered, but the Austrian Bundesliga announced that the sale of a majority of the team would be violating the league's rules. Due to breach of league licence, in November 2015 they were fined €40,000 and had 6 points deducted. This was due to their failure to adhere to the league's stadium requirements.\n\n\n\n"}

Parallax was revealed to have been once imprisoned within the Central Power Battery on the planet Oa, from which all Green Lanterns derive their power, and was the reason for the necessary impurity that in the past rendered the rings useless against anything colored yellow.\n\nIn 2009, Parallax was ranked as IGN's 92nd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.\n\nIn 1994, in an effort to generate interest in its Green Lantern comics, DC replaced Hal Jordan, who had been the primary Green Lantern since the late 1950s, with the character Kyle Rayner, and eliminated the Green Lantern Corps which had served as supporting characters in the series. This was done in the story \"Emerald Twilight\", beginning in \"Green Lantern\" vol. 3 #48 (Jan. 1994). Following the complete destruction of his home town Coast City by the villain Mongul, Hal Jordan descends into madness, destroying the Green Lantern Corps, killing his friend Kilowog and all of the Guardians, except for Ganthet. After this, Jordan assumed the name Parallax and became a supervillain. As detailed in the crossover \"\", Parallax attempted to rewrite history in order to stop the destruction of Coast City by using chronal energy, pulled from the universe by the combined power of the rings of the Green Lanterns he had killed. While Kyle Rayner became the primary Green Lantern of Earth for the next decade, Hal Jordan terrorized the DC universe as the villain Parallax and attempted to make the Cyborg Superman pay for the destruction of Coast City.\n\nHal eventually sacrificed his life to reignite Earth's sun after it was nearly completely eaten. His soul not at peace, Hal then became the new Spectre to seek redemption for what he did as Parallax. The 2004 miniseries \"\", written by Geoff Johns and penciled by Ethan Van Sciver, revealed that Parallax was actually a parasitic entity dating back to the dawn of time and born from the yellow of the emotional spectrum. The parasite was the sentient embodiment of fear, traveling from world to world and causing entire civilizations to destroy themselves out of paranoia.\n\nThe Guardians of the Universe imprisoned Parallax within the Central Power Battery on Oa using fear's opposite energy, willpower, along with the aid of one of the fear's counterparts, Ion. Parallax had lain dormant for billions of years, its true nature hidden by the Guardians to prevent anyone from trying to free it. Being yellow in color, Parallax eventually came to be referred to as simply \"the yellow impurity\", a flaw, whose nature was kept secret from the Corps, that made their rings useless against the color yellow: Parallax weakened its power over the corresponding spectrum; hence, only someone with the willpower to overcome great fear could master the power ring. Thus, when recruiting new Green Lanterns, the Guardians were careful to look for recruits who could do this. When the renegade Sinestro was later imprisoned in the Power Battery himself, his Qwardian yellow power ring tapped into Parallax's power and awakened it.\n\nSince Sinestro harbored hatred for Hal, Parallax chose Jordan as its tool to free itself. Parallax apparently spent years influencing Jordan, causing him to experience increasing self-doubt as well as causing his hair to prematurely whiten at the temples. Jordan's grief over the destruction of Coast City let Parallax influence Jordan's subsequent murderous activity, his apparent killing of Sinestro (actually a hard light construct), and Jordan's destruction of the Central Power Battery.\n\nAfter it was learned something amiss was happening on Oa, a task force (as shown in the \"Emerald Fallout\" series), which consisted of Guy Gardner, Wonder Woman, Captain Atom, Alan Scott, the Martian Manhunter, Ferrin Colos of the Darkstars, and Arisia, ventured to Oa to discover the cause of Guy Gardner's visions of its destruction that were brought about by him wielding Sinestro's power ring (which was also fueled by the power expelled by the Guardians, their rings, batteries, or Parallax himself). On Oa, the task force confronted Hal, but he easily defeated them. Only Alan Scott and Guy Gardner were even able to get a hit on Jordan. Guy proved to be the most effective against Jordan because he could absorb the energy that Jordan was using against him in the battle. Jordan still managed to quickly overpower Guy and destroy his Qwardian power ring. Jordan proceeded to send the whole task force (who were all knocked out from the beating they suffered) back to Earth.\nSince Parallax was gone from the Oan Power Battery, the final power ring conferred to Kyle Rayner did not have any weakness against yellow. The young ring bearer also has some limited resistance to the fear entity's influence as Rayner is a Green Lantern who understands fear, and has the requisite strong will of a ring bearer. Despite being possessed by Parallax, the positive aspect of Jordan's personality would resurface occasionally, eventually leading the infected Jordan to use Parallax's powers to reignite the Sun during the event known as \"The Final Night\", and later aiding the universe's heroes to stop the rogue angel Asmodel from raising Hell to Earth and Heaven in \"Day of Judgment\". Jordan's infected soul later bonded with the Spectre, who knew Parallax's true nature from the start and eventually expelled it from Jordan. The Spectre-Force itself left to search for its next human host. Ganthet guided Jordan's soul back to his own body, preserved after Jordan reignited the Sun. His soul and thoughts finally gaining clarity for the first time in years, Jordan was resurrected, again taking his place as a Green Lantern. Together, Kyle Rayner and fellow Green Lanterns John Stewart, Guy Gardner, a resurrected Kilowog, Hal Jordan, and Ganthet imprisoned the parasite back in the Central Power Battery on Oa.\n\nDespite this reintroduction of the \"yellow impurity\", which is now referred to as the \"Parallax Fear Anomaly\", the power rings' weakness against yellow no longer applies, as experienced wielders are now able to consciously recognize its source, and overcome the fear associated with it. It is still, however, a considerable weakness for new Green Lantern recruits and rookies, who must be taught the impurity's nature and how to combat it. During training, new recruits' rings may falter at times against yellow objects, and/or when a recruit is experiencing panic or fear.\n\nSinestro's Sinestro Corps captures Kyle Rayner with the intention of making him Parallax's new host. Sinestro reveals to Kyle the existence of Ion. Sinestro also informs him that Ion is actually an energy entity that needs a host, similar to Parallax, and it is now attached to Kyle's soul. Sinestro removes the Ion entity from Kyle, who is immediately taken over by Parallax. Parallax then clothes itself in a new uniform (which appears as a combination of Kyle's original Green Lantern costume and the costume Hal Jordan wore as Parallax) and returns to Qward with the Sinestro Corps.\n\nParallax becomes a herald of the reborn Anti-Monitor alongside Hank Henshaw, Superman-Prime, and Sinestro himself. After the massacre of several Green Lanterns, Parallax leads an assault against Hal Jordan, John Stewart, and Guy Gardner, and brings them to Qward. The \"Lost Lanterns\" arrive to rescue the captured Lanterns. During the battle, Parallax murders Jack T. Chance after making him experience his repressed fear of his abusive family.\n\nDuring his possession by Parallax, Kyle witnesses everything that Parallax does, including his murder of Jack. Kyle and Parallax confront each other in a room constructed by Kyle's memories. Kyle changes into Ion and fights Parallax and later conjures a power ring and his original costume. After fighting Parallax for a while, Kyle stabs Parallax with a pencil and regains his self-worth when he sees a painting that his mother painted several years ago. Kyle walks into the painting and ends up in a field walking towards a bright, green star.\n\nLater on Earth, Parallax is about to kill Hal's brother and family when Hal confronts him just before his power ring runs out of power. Hal then tries to free Kyle by reminding him of how fearless his mother was even on her deathbed. Parallax then absorbs Hal into himself; this twofold increase of his powers upon combining the strength of both of his hosts turns him his natural yellow color and develop a costume that more closely resembles the one he wore when Jordan was his only host. Soon after, Guy comes to Parallax with Kyle's mother's painting. This, along with Hal's aid, allows Kyle to fight Parallax from within, and the two manage to escape from Parallax. Now in its original form, Parallax begins to attack Hal, Guy, John, and Kyle. Ganthet and Sayd arrive and imprison Parallax within the Earth Lanterns' four Power Batteries. The effects of Parallax within the four Power Batteries has yet to be revealed.\n\nIn \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 4) #41 (2009), it was revealed in the third part of the Agent Orange arc that Parallax was once sealed in a box that Larfleeze had stolen from the Guardians of the Universe. The box was returned to the Guardians in exchange for the orange light of avarice.\n\nWhile Jordan and his allies defend Coast City against the Black Lantern Corps, the Black Lantern Spectre attempts to claim him. Believing that the Spectre fears Parallax, Hal Jordan has Ganthet summon the power batteries that currently held it. Once summoned, Hal allows Sinestro to release Parallax and, once it is free, provokes it into merging with him. A resulting explosion of yellow light quickly fades and soon reveals that Parallax is in full control of Hal and eager to challenge the Spectre once more. Parallax tears into the Black Lantern Spectre's body, freeing the real Spectre and destroying the facsimile. Parallax then attempts to destroy the Spectre, who uses his own fear for it, coupled with the love Carol Ferris feels for Hal, to separate Parallax from its host. Parallax is then pulled away by an unknown force to an unknown location.\n\nAfter Sinestro becomes a White Lantern, he views the history of the emotional spectrum, and discovers that the first creature in existence to feel fear had evolved into Parallax.\n\nParallax is later revealed to have been transported to planet Ryut, where a cloaked villain trapped the fear entity in some kind of energy bubble and chained it to a monolith bearing the Sinestro Corps symbol. Around Parallax are other monoliths bearing the symbols of the other Lantern corps.\n\nLater, when Hal Jordan, the Flash (Barry Allen), and the rest of their allies try to find the emotional entities, they locate Parallax (apparently under the command of the mysterious figure) and the Scarlet Speedster becomes the latest host for the fear entity after it senses the hero's concerns for Jordan's safety from it. By inhabiting the living generator of the Speed Force, Parallax is even more powerful by combining the extradimensional energy the speedster creates with its own powers. Despite this, the embodiment of fear still desires Hal Jordan as its host as they fight. However, an intervention by the mystery villain prevents Parallax's attempts, and reveals that Jordan now has the skills to resist it anyway. As the embodiment of compassion, Proselyte, began to free the Flash from Parallax's control by reigniting his emotion for compassion over his fear, the embodiment of hope, Adara, began fighting the cloaked villain, who reveals that all this is actually a ruse so that he could capture them all — which he does — revealing himself to be the renegade Guardian Krona.\n\nWhen Krona attacks Oa, he places Parallax inside the Central Power Battery, restoring the yellow impurity and giving him control over almost all Green Lanterns. Hal, John, Guy and Kyle are able to resist Parallax's influence due to their past experience with it, using the rings of the other six Corps to fight off Krona's forces long enough for Guy using the rings of the Red Lantern Corps and the Star Sapphires simultaneously to tear the Central Power Battery's shell away and remove Parallax. After Krona's defeat, Parallax escaped along with the other entities and is currently at large in the universe.\n\nIn September 2011, \"The New 52\" rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, it is shown that Parallax is in the Yellow Central Power Battery where the entity stays until he is released by Sinestro at the conclusion of the \"Wrath of the First Lantern\" story. In order to destroy the First Lantern Volthoom, Sinestro allows Parallax to possess his body. Contrary to previous hosts of Parallax, this time, however, Sinestro is in control of the entity instead of the other way around. Their effort in defeating Volthoom, however, proves to be unsuccessful, with Volthoom only being defeated when Hal returns as a Black Lantern and summons Nekron to restore Volthoom's mortality. After Volthoom's defeat, Sinestro as Parallax proceeds to kill the Guardians of the Universe, sparing only Ganthet and Sayd in the process. Sinestro then states his intention to travel far from Oa and release Parallax.\n\nIn the \"Lights Out\" story, the Entity reveals that all embodiments are dying and they must return to the place of their origin, except Parallax because it is currently entrapped. In the aftermath, it is revealed that Parallax is still bonded with Sinestro, who controls the entity. Later, Sinestro releases and separate Parallax within the core of Warworld's base, trying to prevent the destruction i of the new headquarters of Sinestro Corps, after the Green Lantern Corps were apparently dissolved.\n\nSubsequently, in \"DC Rebirth\", Parallax is being hosted by Sinestro again as he has plans to rule the universe with fear. The power of Parallax is increased by Sinestro to one thousand percent of the power of fear to face Hal Jordan, who has returned as Green Lantern. Before Sinestro attacks him, he discovers too late that his and Parallax's powers have decreased due to Soranik Natu rescuing people from being imprisoned and escaping with them. Hal then uses his energies as a living construct to incinerate the Fear Warlord. Sinestro tries to use Parallax's powers to stop Hal, but fails as Hal destroys the base of the Sinestro Corps, Warworld, seemingly killing both Sinestro and Parallax in the process.\n\nParallax is revealed to have survived and found its way to Earth, having shrunk in size. It starts kidnapping children to feed on their fear and regain its strength and power. The entity possesses the body of one of the children, Zachariah Ferruci, and kidnaps another child until they are found by Superman. Parallax uses the children to fight back against Superman and flees. The next day, Parallax welcomes Superman to the place where it is keeping the children. Parallax transforms into his normal size and reveals to Superman who he is. Parallax tries to possess Superman, but Superman is able to force it out. However, Parallax begins draining the children's lives, forcing Superman to submit. Parallax possesses Superman and as it claims that nothing can hurt it anymore, Parallax is struck from behind by Sinestro, who has returned to claim it for himself. During the fight, Parallax refuses to possess Sinestro for this action, so Sinestro teleports to Qward, as the Weaponers are to restrain the entity. While Parallax apparently possesses Superman, he is contained as Sinestro attempts to remove Parallax from Superman; however, Superman tells him that he is not under Parallax's control. Parallax is possessing the Weaponers to attack Sinestro. Parallax separates from the Weaponers and tries to escape. Sinestro fails to capture Parallax and so his power is drained and he collapses; then, Superman takes his yellow ring and files into Parallax's mouth. Superman uses his fear to imprison Parallax within the yellow ring, while Sinestro is no match for Superman and flees.\n\nLater, Superman waits for Hal Jordan to return to Earth, explaining the previous fight with Parallax. Hal imprisons Parallax within a yellow ring for transportation back to Mogo.\n\nParallax has immense fear-casting and mind-control powers, strong enough to easily frighten and control the likes of Superman, Wonder Woman, and even a being like the Spectre, except those who are capable of understanding and conquering inner fear such as Hal Jordan, Kyle Rayner or Batman. However, it was unable to control Alan Scott, even though he experienced fear from Parallax (Abin Sur explains that in humans fear is intellectual, which may have something to do with the ineffectuality of Parallax's powers and the fear entity itself mentioned that Alan's power differs from the fear entity, the Guardians, and the Green Lantern Corps, as they derive their powers from the emotional spectrum), although he did experience a fever which led him to increasingly weaken during Parallax's attempts. It can take possession of someone's body when they feel even the slightest fear. Parallax is also capable of creating solid light constructs, such as creating a convincing duplicate of Sinestro for Hal Jordan to kill. Parallax can create both green and yellow objects or creatures. As a being of pure energy, Parallax has no true physical form of its own; it generally changes into forms that will instill fear in its victims.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1946103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946103", "title": "Cloud Club", "text": "Cloud Club\n\nThe Cloud Club was a lunch club that occupied the 66th, 67th, and 68th floors of the Chrysler Building in New York City. At one time it was the highest lunch club in the world. It opened in 1930 and closed in 1979.\n\nTexaco, a prospective tenant, had asked the management of the Chrysler Building to create a restaurant for executives. The Cloud Club opened in July 1930. At the time of its opening it had 300 members. As a result of the club opening, Texaco leased fourteen floors. The club was open during daylight hours and was closed in the evening. \n\nMany famous executives based in the tower had lunch in the club. The club was only for men for several decades. In the 1950s and 1960s newer clubs opened, causing the attendance at the Cloud Club to decrease. In 1971 180 corporations supplied 300 members of the club. The club declined more as competition from other clubs increased and as companies moved offices to suburban areas. Texaco moved its employees to Westchester, New York in 1977, and the club closed in 1979.\n\nTishman Speyer, which took over the Chrysler Building in 1998 and refurbished it, leased the top two floors of the Cloud Club space to tenants.\n\nWilliam Van Alen and Walter Chrysler had differing ideas of what the Cloud Club should be. The former had preferences for the modernist style while Chrysler had a preference for faux medieval and baronial styles. Charles McGrath of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the final design \"reflected a somewhat uneasy compromise\" between the men. Christopher Gray of \"The New York Times\" stated that the \"Cloud Club was a curious mix of historic and modern.\"\n\nCharles McGrath of \"The New York Times\" stated that the space overall \"seems almost preposterously small by today's standards\" and because of all of the facilities inside it, its \"backstage\" areas \"must have felt like a submarine - or, rather, like a very cramped airship.\"\n\nThe 66th floor was the point of entry into the club. Cloud motifs were used in the entry area. The pilasters and friezes were in a neo-Classical style. The bathrooms and elevator surrounds used an Art Deco style. The flooring was made of pegged planks. This floor had a bar and grill room, done in an \"olde English\" style, which used leaded glass doors, wood beams, chandeliers of wrought-iron, and floors in pegged planks. It also had a Tudor-style lounge decorated in oak paneling in a mortise-and-tenon style.\n\nThe main dining room, on the 67th floor, was located on the club's south side and had a capacity of 30 people. The north wall had a mural of Manhattan. The room was decorated with etched glass sconces and granite columns. The room had a view of New York City. The vaulted ceiling, in a Cathedral style, had a cloud mural. McGrath described it as having \"a futuristic, Fritz Lang sort of look\". A Renaissance-style staircase in marble and bronze connected the dining room with the 66th floor.\n\nThe private dining room for Walter Chrysler was located on the 67th floor. It used black etched paneling, and included an etched frieze of automobile workers. This room had a view of Central Park. There was another private dining room that was for Texaco. It included a mural of an oil refinery, the Texaco logo, and a truck. It \"was reputed to be the grandest men's room in all of New York\" according to McGrath. The facility also had a stock ticker room.\n\nThe service areas included a barber shop, a humidor, kitchens, and a locker room. During the Prohibition alcohol was stored in cabinets in the locker room.\n\nThe fruit served included \"No. 18\" pink grapefruits, larger than supermarket grapefruits, and melons that were produced in a farm in Upstate New York owned by a club member. The most well-known dishes were bread-and-butter pudding, black bean soup, and Dover sole.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1946105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946105", "title": "Plymouth-Canton Educational Park", "text": "Plymouth-Canton Educational Park\n\nThe Plymouth-Canton Educational Park (commonly PCEP or \"The Park\") encompasses three public secondary schools—Salem High School, Canton High School, and Plymouth High School—in Canton Township, Michigan, United States within Metro Detroit. PCEP is located on a campus.\n\nPCEP is part of the Plymouth-Canton Community Schools District, serving portions of Wayne County and Washtenaw County, including City of Plymouth, Plymouth Township, and parts of Canton Township, Salem Township, Superior Township, and Northville Township.\n\nThe original Plymouth High School was built in the early 20th century on the northwest corner of Main Street and Church Street, opposite from present-day City Hall in present-day downtown Plymouth, Michigan. The district deemed the facility to be outdated by the 1960s for high school use. The facility was closed as a high school after the 1969–70 school year and used exclusively for 9th grade in 1970–71 and 1971–72.\n\nWhen the first new high school opened in the present-day Plymouth-Canton Educational Park, the original Plymouth High School was converted into a middle school, dubbed Central Middle School (in conjunction with the previously constructed East and West Middle Schools). Central Middle School remains a landmark in downtown and closed after the 2014–15 school year.\n\nOriginally planned to simply remain Plymouth High School, the school's name was changed to Plymouth-Salem High School after Canton opened. Although the school district serves much of rural Salem Township, Salem residents were not necessarily exclusive to Plymouth-Salem.\n\nPlymouth High's colors of red, white, and blue, were split up, with Plymouth-Salem retaining blue and white, and the eventual Canton High School teams taking the red with white. Plymouth-Salem retained their \"Rocks\" mascot; supposedly named for the large unmovable boulder that sits outside the school. It is a tradition for students to spray paint this rock for school events and to celebrate important sports victories. The rock was moved during the renovations in 2008.\n\nSalem is divided into two main sections, North and South. The north side contains the swimming pool and the Gloria Logan Auditorium, and a two-level gymnasium on the south side, divided by a wide central hallway leading to the east entrance of the school. A staircase leads to the second-floor corridor near the entrance to the auditorium. The west side contains three floors of classrooms, as well as the cafeteria on the southeast side of the first floor. Administrative offices are located on the northeast side of the first two floors. The center of the second floor is dominated by the school library, and also features the studio for radio station WSDP. Stairwells on the north and south sides, referred to as the North Tower and South Tower, respectively, provide access to all three floors, and an elevator provides access for students unable to use the stairs.\n\nOne of the more distinctive features of the school building was its large ramp at the North Mall, which provided direct access to the second floor of classrooms. What made this ramp unusual were the three steps placed at the bottom of the ramp, purposely making vehicle access impractical. The ramp was demolished in the early 1990s, and the North Mall was revamped to provide a more appealing façade, while the South Mall was eliminated in favor of an expanded cafeteria. The school underwent renovations from 2006 to 2008, and went through renovations for more office space in 2011.\n\nIn 2002, with the opening of the new Plymouth High School as part of the PCEP, \"Plymouth\" was dropped from Salem and Canton's name. Individually the high schools are known as Salem High School, Canton High School and Plymouth High School.\n\nIn addition to the formal online school resources, the school's parents, coaches and boosters proudly and voluntarily contribute content related to their group and team activities at \"Salem Rocks\".\n\nOpened in August 2002 and constructed southwest of Salem High School, the new Plymouth High School was designed by the architecture firm French Associates. The students selected to be Plymouth High's first senior class, the Class of 2006, were polled during their 6th grade year to come up with the school's colors and mascot. Their selection, the Predators (after the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League), was met with opposition from some parents who associated it with sexual predators. As a result, the school decided to use the generic \"Wildcats\" nickname, while still using the saber-toothed tiger logo of the Nashville Predators. Plymouth's school colors were to be purple and white (a combination of the red and blue of Salem and Canton), but they were changed to black and silver.\n\nThe campus covers 305 acres, much of which encompasses athletic fields. Students can have classes in all three academic buildings, even though each student is assigned to one \"home school\" from which he or she is to graduate from and play sports for. Students are permitted 10 minutes passing time to walk among their classes. There has been criticism that it is unsafe for students to walk through several inches (centimeters) of snow, but the superintendent still gives snow days as rarely as possible. State Law, however, does require that passage between buildings be halted in the event of lightning, though this has happened only twice since the beginning of the 2008–09 school year. One advantage to the 3-in-1 idea is reduced cost: there is only one auto shop (at Canton), one culinary arts facility (at Salem), two darkrooms for photography (one at Salem, one at Canton), one varsity football field (at Canton), two swimming pools (at Salem & Canton), two soccer and football fields (at Canton and Plymouth), one Robotics Shop (at Canton), one orchestra complex (at Canton), and one band complex (at Plymouth).\n\nFor most of its history, the campus has contained Canton High School and Salem High School, with a great rivalry built between the two neighbors. For many years the campus operated under block scheduling, seen as an innovative way to allow for longer periods of uninterrupted teaching time. After many years, The Park resorted back to a traditional schedule with 6 classes per day and 2 semesters of classes per year. Currently, The Park is considered a \"Closed Campus\", meaning no student may leave during the school day without a pass from the office.\n\nPrior to the summer of 2006, the Cady family barn was also a part of the campus. It has since been moved to the Canton Township Cherry Hill village area next to a historic home. Included on the campus grounds is also a small strip of forest that backs a nearby neighborhood. Various trails are scattered throughout the wooded area. An Artesian well can be found in the wooded area, and is visited by earth science and ecology classes yearly. A creek that is part of the Rouge River watershed runs through the campus, separating Canton High School and Phase III, which are to the north of the creek; Plymouth High School is located to the south. Environmental science classes held at the park regularly take water samples to monitor water quality from this creek.\n\nThe Park has over 130 active sports teams and over 96 active clubs and organizations, including a radio station, Marching Band, and FIRST Robotics Team. All three Science Olympiad teams qualified for the state level competition in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2016, 2017, and 2018. Also, Plymouth's 2007 Novice and 2009 Varsity Quiz Bowl teams won the championship in the tri-county area. Additionally, The Park’s FIRST Robotics Team, Lightning Robotics, won the FIRST World Championship in 2017.\n\nThere are many clubs dedicated to different languages, cultures, and lifestyles, such as the African American Student Association, Spanish and Latino Students' Association (SALSA), Asian Pacific American Club (APAC), Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA), Polish American Club, Indian-American Student Association (IASA), French Club, Muslim Student Association (MSA), Middle Eastern Student Association, Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA), Secular Student Alliance, and the Diversity Council. An annual Celebration of Diversity (COD) is held by some cultural clubs for support and recognition.\n\nPCEP's radio station, WSDP 88.1FM \"The Park\", has won numerous awards, including the Michigan Association of Broadcaster's annual 'Station of the Year' prize, which it has won nearly every year in the past decade. The station was started in 1972 at 89.3FM. Bonny Dore, Mary Phyl Godfroy, John Seidelman and Jeff Cardinal were the first faculty advisors. Multiple radio air talents, program directors and even station managers started their careers at WSDP.\n\nThe Park also has a Debate Club, a Model United Nations Club, a three Mock Trial teams, a \"FIRST\" Robotics Team , a Distributive Education Clubs of American chapter, Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD) chapter, and an Investment Club, among other clubs geared towards educational incentives. The Park's National Honor Society and Robotics Team have been recognized by the American Cancer Society for their efforts in supporting and running the community fundraising walk for cancer cures, Relay for Life.\n\nIn particular, the DECA organization is popular among the marketing students at the Park. DECA prepares students to become leaders in their fields, whether it be marketing, finance, hospitality or management in high schools and colleges all over the world. The DECA organization brings together students from all three schools at PCEP and their chapter made it all the way to nationals in 2007–08, 2008–09, and 2010–11.\n\nThe theatrical side of the performing arts program at the park consists of two groups: The Park Players, based at Salem High School, and The Second Stage Players, based at Canton High School. Any student who attends PCEP can audition for shows produced by either group.\n\nThe performing arts program began with the formation of what is now the Park Players in 1970 by Gloria Logan, a drama teacher at Salem. The first three productions were staged at Central Middle School. The first production staged in Salem Auditorium was \"Fiddler on the Roof\" in 1971; as a tradition, a revival of \"Fiddler\" has been staged on the 10th and 20th anniversary years of the auditorium (1981 and 1991), while the most recent revival was staged in 2000, the 30th anniversary of the Parkstage two fully produced, faculty-directed In the 09-10 school year, Second Stage Players produced two mainstage productions, The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee\" in the fall, and The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged) in the spring.\n\nThe Park Players have staged over 85 productions, including Neil Simon's \"Proposals\", \"Footloose (musical)\", \"Hello, Dolly!\", \"Jekyll and Hyde\", and \"Smokey Joe's Cafe\". During the 2009–10 school year, the Park Players celebrated their 14th anniversary. They performed three stage productions: Noises Off as their fall play, Sweet Charity as their spring musical, and Check Please/Check Please: Take Two as an in-between production.\n\nThe Park also has a Spoken Word Club and a Puppetry Club.\n\nThere are two orchestra classes. The lower orchestra is called Concert Orchestra, while the upper one is called Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThere are seven choir classes at PCEP.\n\n"}

The borders of the province slightly shifted through history, and some mapmakers, such as Nicolas Sanson (1650), Johannes Blaeu (1662), and Bernard Antoine Jaillot (1733), show it extending into Cognac, traditionally part of Angoumois, and to the parishes of Braud-et-Saint-Louis and Étauliers, part of the Pays Gabay on the right bank of the Gironde River.\n\nToday, four fifths of the historical Saintonge province occupies the modern \"département\" of Charente-Maritime. Most of the other fifth is in Charente, and a small section extends north into Deux-Sèvres, all within the administrative region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine.\n\nThe province derives its name from the \"Santones\", an ancient Gallic tribe that once inhabited the area. During antiquity, Saintonge was part of the Roman province of Gallia Aquitania, and Saintes became its first capital. The region fell under the control of the kings and dukes of Aquitaine, the counts of Anjou, then the counts of Poitiers, before becoming integrated for centuries in the new Duchy of Aquitaine. Occupying the frontier between Capetian and Plantagenet-controlled areas during the late Middle Ages, between 1152 and 1451, it was the site of constant struggles between lords torn between their allegiance to Anglo-Aquitaine and those linked to Paris. \n\nSaintonge was primarily attached to Anglo-Aquitaine until the mid-fourteenth century. However, errors by Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster and Edward, the Black Prince gradually contributed to weakening English power, and the province ultimately came under the control of the King of France, Charles VII, \"the Victorious\", in 1451.\n\nSaintonge was the birthplace of French explorer Jean Allefonsce (or Alfonse) in 1484, and Samuel de Champlain in 1574, who explored the New World and founded Quebec. It also was one of the centers of French Huguenots, Protestants.\n\nThe distinctive Saintongeais dialect (patouê saintonjhouê, jhabrail) was once spoken throughout Saintonge, as well as in the provinces of Aunis and Angoumois.\n\nThe region is famous for its grapes, which are used to produce cognac and Pineau des Charentes.\n\nThis area is famous for its medieval pottery, which was widely exported. Shards of it have been found in large quantities in medieval excavations throughout Ireland and other European countries. These shards are from vessels made and exported as a by-product of the Bordeaux wine trade (Deroeux and Dufournier, 1991). This ware has been found on Irish excavations from the later 12th century but it is most commonly uncovered in 13th-century contexts. They consist of an off-white micaceous fabric with moderate amounts of quartz and sparse inclusions of haematite. They are glazed on the external surface only, with a clear lead glaze. In Saintonge Green wares, the addition of copper filings, or copper oxide to the clear lead glaze, produced a mottled mid-green colouring. Many forms of Saintonge wares were produced, including Saintonge Polychrome, Saintonge Green, and in some cases unglazed wares. Slipped Saintonge is more consistent in colour and appearance than unslipped, having the benefit of an undercoating to regulate the process. \n\nThe most common forms of vessel produced in this ware were wine jugs. These were characteristically tall, with slightly ovoid bodies, flat bases, parrot-beak spouts and strap handles.\n\nSaintonge was exported well through the 17th century. Acadians and French colonists in Quebec and Eastern Canada imported many Saintonge ceramics, including bowls, plates, mugs and other types. Many Saintonge ceramic fragments have been found in context with 17th-century colonists and are often used as evidence of pre-British occupation of these areas.\n\n\n"}

The only permanent settlement on the Stikine River, it is home to approximately 250 members of Tahltan First Nation and non-native residents. The town offers basic services, including Anglican and Catholic churches, a general store, a post office, a clinic with several nurses on-call around the clock, two Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers, and a K-9 school. Steep river banks and rocky gorges form the terraced nature of the geography.\n\nThe community includes Telegraph Creek Indian Reserve No. 6, Telegraph Creek Indian Reserve No. 6A, and Guhthe Tah Indian Reserve No. 12 which are under the governance of the Tahltan First Nation of Telegraph Creek. Stikine Indian Reserve No. 7, which is one mile west (downstream) and on the opposite side of the Stikine River, is under the governance of the Iskut First Nation of the settlement of Iskut, which is on the river of the same name. The two bands together comprise the Tahltan Nation.\n\nTahltan (or Nahanni) refers to a Northern Athabaskan people that live around Telegraph Creek, Dease Lake and Iskut.\n\nThe Stikine region is the traditional home of the Tahltan people, who have lived there for generations. The modern history of the Telegraph Creek and Dease Lake area dates back to the 1860s and 1870s with the Stikine and Cassiar Gold Rushes. Telegraph Creek witnessed the discovery of gold by prospectors on the Stikine River in the 1860s and was the head of navigation. In 1866, the construction of the Russian-American Telegraph line to the Yukon gave Telegraph Creek its name.\n\nAs early as 10,000 years ago, the Tahltan people used obsidian from the Mount Edziza volcanic complex to make tools and weapons for trading material. This is the main source of obsidian found in northwestern British Columbia.\n\nIn 1874, Nellie Cashman, nicknamed \"the Angel of Cassiar\", opened a boarding house for miners in Telegraph Creek during the Cassiar gold rush.\n\nAuthor Edward Hoagland wrote extensively about Telegraph Creek in his 1969 book \"Notes from the Century Before: A Journal from British Columbia\" in which he reveals the presence of a high level of ghost activities.\n\nTelegraph and its surrounding areas are known for their hiking, riverboating, camping, hunting and fishing. There are organized tours lasting from half a day to several days.\n\nThe area surrounding Telegraph Creek holds five British Columbia Provincial parks: \n\nThe road to Telegraph Creek is beautiful but rough, with 112 km (69 mi) of gravel, steep gradients (up to 20%), narrow passages along canyon walls with no guardrails, and sharp-angled switchbacks. The road should be driven with caution and awareness, but is suitable for most vehicles. The community can also be reached by water, via the Stikine River from Alaska and by air.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the mayor of Taba commune in Gitarama prefecture from April 1993 until June 1994.\n\nAs mayor, Akayesu was responsible for performing executive functions and maintaining order in Taba, meaning he had command of the communal police and any gendarmes assigned to the commune. He was subject only to the prefect. He was considered well-liked and intelligent.\n\nDuring the Rwandan genocide of mid-1994, many Tutsis were killed in Akayesu's commune, and many others were subject to violence and other forms of hatred. Akayesu not only refrained from stopping the killings, but personally supervised the murder of various Tutsis. He also gave a death list to other Hutus, and ordered house-to-house searches to locate Tutsis.\n\nAkayesu was arrested in Zambia in October 1995, making Zambia the first African nation to extradite criminals to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).\n\nIn 1996, Godeliève Mukasarasi was contacted by the United Nations to assist in putting together a case against him. Mukasarasi was intimidated and her husband and daughter were killed but she found four people who were willing to testify. She was given an International Women of Courage Award in 2018 for this and other work.\n\nHe stood trial for 15 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity, including rape during the Rwandan genocide and violations of the Geneva Convention. Pierre-Richard Prosper was the lead prosecutor. Akayesu's defence team argued that Akayesu had no part in the killings, and that he had been powerless to stop them. In short, the defence argued, Akayesu was being made a scapegoat for the crimes of the people of Taba.\n\nDespite this defence, the ICTR found him guilty of 9 counts of genocide and crimes against humanity, but Not Guilty of Grave Breaches of the Geneva Conventions. This was notable in that it was the first time that the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was enforced and in doing so clearly differentiated the mental element of the crime Genocide from the mental element in the breaches of the Geneva Conventions. The court clarified that Genocide is a specific crime that takes the accused outside of the scope of armed conflict. On October 2, 1998, Akayesu was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nHe was represented by Montreal lawyer John Philpot, brother of Parti Québécois politician and author Robin Philpot; this connection later surfaced in the 2007 Quebec general election after statements from Robin Philpot's book \"Rwanda 1994: Colonialism Dies Hard\" appearing to deny the extent of the genocide were widely publicized.\n\nHere is the relevant section of the September 1999 United Nations report: Fourth Annual Report of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to the General Assembly (September 1999)\n\n\"\"Report of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994\":\"\n\"The Prosecutor v. Jean Paul Akayesu (ICTR-96-4-T)\"\n\n\"14. On 2 September 1998, Trial Chamber I of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judges Laïty Kama, Presiding, Lennart Aspegren and Navanethem Pillay, found Jean Paul Akayesu guilty of 9 of the 15 counts proffered against him, including genocide, direct and public incitement to commit genocide and crimes against humanity (extermination, murder, torture, rape and other inhumane acts). Jean Paul Akayesu was found not guilty of the six remaining counts, including the count of complicity in genocide and the counts relating to violations of article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions and of Additional Protocol II thereto.\"\n\n\"15. The Akayesu judgement includes the first interpretation and application by an international court of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\"\n\n\"16. The Trial Chamber held that rape, which it defined as \"a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive\", and sexual assault constitute acts of genocide insofar as they were committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group, as such. It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only, manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide.\"\n\n\"17. On 2 September 1998, Jean Paul Akayesu was sentenced to life imprisonment for each of the nine counts, the sentences to run concurrently.\"\n\n\"18. Both Jean Paul Akayesu and the Prosecutor have appealed against the judgement rendered by the Trial Chamber.\"\nAkayesu was transferred to Mali on 9 December 2001 to serve out his sentence there.\n\nThe trial is the subject of the 2015 documentary film, \"The Uncondemned\".\n\n"}

He was born in France, and won 44 caps for Tunisia, representing the nation at the 2006 World Cup and three Africa Cup of Nations tournaments.\n\nAfter retiring as a player he went into coaching, and managed Marbella and Mérida (two spells) before joining Badajoz in October 2018.\n\nBorn in Toulouse, France, Nafti made his professional debut with his hometown club, Toulouse FC. He was used sparingly during a three-year spell, and also played several games with the reserves. His best season was 1999–2000, as he appeared in 13 games and scored once to help the team return to Ligue 1 after one year of absence.\n\nIn summer 2000, Nafti joined Racing de Santander in La Liga and, as in his previous club, started his stint appearing for the B-team. In the 2000–01 season he played in just three games for the main squad, which was eventually relegated, then proceeded to become a very important midfield element for the Cantabrians in the following three years, whilst collecting 41 yellow cards and three red.\n\nNafti was signed on loan by Birmingham City in the final minutes of the January 2005 transfer window, making his Premier League debut on 5 February in a 2–0 loss away to Manchester United in which he started and was booked. Sometimes referred to as \"Nasty\" due to his fiery nature and tendency for cautions, he was primarily signed to replace the outgoing Robbie Savage, and finished the season strongly, which led to a permanent deal being agreed in the summer.\n\nNafti's 2005–06 campaign came to end before it had even begun, with a severe injury to his cruciate ligaments in a friendly with Deportivo La Coruña in early August 2005. He recovered sooner than expected, and was able to start the last match of the season, a 1–0 loss at Bolton Wanderers, with relegation already confirmed.\n\nAfter having appeared in 32 games in 2006–07 to help Birmingham return to the top division, Nafti scored his first goal for them on 13 August 2008, in a 4–0 win against Wycombe Wanderers in the 2008–09 League Cup. In June 2009, after the club chose not to renew his contract, he signed a two-year deal with Aris Thessaloniki in Greece.\n\nOn 12 September 2009, Nafti scored the only goal of the home match against PAS Giannina to put Aris top of the Superleague Greece after three matches. He finished his debut season with four goals from 22 league games, as Aris finished fifth.\n\nDuring the January 2011 transfer window, the 32-year-old Nafti left Aris and returned to Spain, signing an 18-month contract with Segunda División club Real Valladolid. He spent the 2012–13 season with Real Murcia, helping them avoid relegation from the second tier, and had considered retiring from the game before dropping down a division to sign for Cádiz. He established himself in the latter team but was also troubled by injury, and after they signed midfielder Jon Ander Garrido in the January 2014 transfer window, Nafti's contract was cancelled.\n\nA Tunisia international since 2002, Nafti represented the nation in three Africa Cup of Nations tournaments, helping it win the 2004 edition played on home soil. He then appeared in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, playing against Australia (2–0 win) and Germany (3–0 loss).\n\nNafti was selected for the squad that competed in the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, appearing in all three matches as Tunisia exited in the group stage.\n\nOn 10 June 2016, Nafti was given his first managerial job, at Segunda División B club Marbella, despite reportedly not possessing the licence required to manage at that level. After a series of poor results, he was fired on 7 March 2017.\n\nNafti was hired by another Segunda B club, Mérida, on 27 June 2017; he lasted until 20 December. The following 12 March, after the resignation of his successor, Loren, he returned to the Estadio Romano as manager, but left at the end of the season after failing to prevent their relegation.\n\nIn October 2018, Nafti took over as manager of Badajoz, also of Segunda B, until the end of the season. In the 2019–20 season, his team eliminated Las Palmas (second tier) and Eibar (top flight) from the Copa del Rey before an extra-time loss to Granada in the last 16.

{"id": "1946161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946161", "title": "Nicorette", "text": "Nicorette\n\nNicorette is the brand name of a number of products for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) that contain nicotine. Developed in the late 1970s in Sweden by in the form of a chewing gum, Nicorette was the first nicotine replacement product on the market.\n\nThe product range encompasses chewing gum, lozenges, patches of two kinds (transparent and non-transparent), oral spray (Nicorette QuickMist), inhalator, sublingual tablets (Nicorette Microtab) and nasal spray.\n\nThe products are manufactured by McNeil Consumer Healthcare company, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. GlaxoSmithKline is the licence holder of Nicorette gum in the United States while Johnson & Johnson markets Nicorette globally.\n\nNicotine replacement products including gum and transdermal patches are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system.\n\nThe brand name \"Nicorette\" comes from \"nicotine\" and , \"right way\".\n\nNicorette products are indicated for the relief of withdrawal symptoms associated with nicotine withdrawal and to aid in smoking cessation. It is suggested that Nicorette products should be used in \"conjunction with a behavioural support programme\".\n\nPrior to 2005 nicotine products in Britain were only licensed to \"assist smokers who were making an immediate and complete quit attempt\". Following advice from a working group set up by the Committee on Safety of Medicines (since 2005 the Commission on Human Medicines) the MHRA concluded that NRT products should be used also by those who are unable to stop abruptly.\n\nCurrently Nicorette products in the UK are indicated to:\n\nThe products are intended for adults and children over 12 years of age as well as pregnant and lactating women (it has been concluded that \"the use of NRT in pregnancy does not give undue concern and any harm caused by nicotine replacement must be compared with that caused by continued smoking – which is extremely harmful to both the woman and her child\".)\n\nNicorette, like all other NRT products, are most beneficial for heavy smokers (more than 15 cigarettes per day). There are not enough studies to show that NRT helps those who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes per day.\n\nThe typical contraindication (reason to not use) for Nicorette products is hypersensitivity to nicotine.\n\nUp until recently cardiovascular disease was considered to be a contraindication to nicotine replacement therapy products. However, in 2003 the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS) removed all cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease contraindications. In 2005 the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency followed suit. The rationale is that the benefit of nicotine replacement therapy outweighs the risks of nicotine medication, even in smokers with cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn 2013 the US FDA stated that the contraindication concerning usage of NRT products while smoking is no longer valid.\n\nThe FDA approved labeling for Nicorette products with a warning concerning pregnancy and breastfeeding: \"This medicine is believed to be safer than smoking. However, the risks to your child from this medicine are not fully known\". The FDA suggests not using Nicorette products if the patient continues to smoke, or use chewing tobacco, snuff or other nicotine-containing products.\n\nThe FDA advises consulting a doctor before using the product if the patient previously had:\nSpecific contraindications listed by the FDA for various formats include sodium-restricted diet, stomach ulcer of diabetes (for gums and lozenges), or an allergy to adhesive tape or skin problems (for patches).\n\nThe FDA suggests stopping use of Nicorette products in cases of irregular heartbeat or palpitations, symptoms of nicotine overdose (nausea, vomiting, dizziness, weakness, and rapid heartbeat) or skin redness caused by the patch.\n\nNicorette chewing gum releases nicotine while chewing. Nicotine then is absorbed across the oral mucosa into the systemic circulation. Patients are advised to chew the gum slowly and intermittently to avoid the risk of releasing too much nicotine. It is also suggested not to eat or drink while chewing since foods and beverages can reduce nicotine absorption.\n\nNicorette chewing gum is available in two strengths: 2 mg/piece and 4 mg/piece. Dosing would depend on the degree of nicotine dependence: light smokers should use 2 mg gum, heavy smokers (more than 25 cigarettes a day) should use 4 mg gum.\nPatients should chew gum once they feel the craving. The average adult dosage is 9 to 12 pieces per day. FDA limits maximum daily amount of 2 mg gums to 24 pieces.\n\nIt is suggested to use gum following a 12-week schedule, reducing the amount of gums consumed by the end of the therapy.\n\nThe patches provide slow absorption of nicotine into blood within the day and work for 16 hours. They are usually applied in the morning and removed at bedtime.\n\nThe patch supports smoking cessation within 12 week programme: 25 mg patch (25 mg nicotine over 16 hours) for eight weeks (Step 1), 15 mg patch for two weeks (Step 2), 10 mg patch for the last two weeks (Step 3). Light smokers (less than 10 cigarettes per day) were recommended to start at Step 2 (15 mg) for eight weeks and reduce the dose to 10 mg for the last four weeks.\n\nMicrotab supplies nicotine to the body by mouth. It is different from the chewing gum because instead of chewing the patient should allow the tablet to dissolve slowly under the tongue (the tablet dissolves in about 20-30 minutes). The action is similar to 2 mg nicotine gum.\n\nMicrotabs are used either for smoking cessation or smoking reduction. For smoking cessation the standard dose is one tablet (2 mg) per hour for patients who smoke less than 20 cigarettes per day. When the craving is strong two tablets can be taken instead of one. Most patients require between 8 and 24 tablets per day. British Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommends not to exceed 40 tablets per day limit. Treatment should be stopped when daily consumption is around 1-2 tablets per day.\n\nA spray of nicotine is available. Tentative evidence supports that it is better than a placebo. MHRA suggests not to use more than 2 sprays at a time, up to 4 sprays per hour and no more than 64 sprays per 24 hours period.\n\nThe Nicorette brand started with a nicotine chewing gum developed in Helsingborg (Sweden) by the company Leo AB, later part of Pharmacia & Upjohn. It was the first product for nicotine replacement therapy and gained its inventor, Ove Fernö, titles like \"the founding father of modern pharmacotherapy for smoking\".\n\nOn December 12, 1967, Fernö, Vice President of Research and Development at AB Leo, received a mail from his friend Dr. Claes Lundgren at the Department of Aviation Medicine at the Physiological Institute of Lund University, suggesting he develop an orally consumed substitute for tobacco. He and his colleague Stefan Lichtneckert noted how submariners and aviation crews switched from cigarettes to chewing tobacco and snus when smoking was not possible. They also suggested the product name \"Nicorette\". Fernö began experimenting with nicotine gum in 1969 and quit smoking himself after one year of use.\n\nThe first nicotine chewing gum was produced at AB Leo in 1971. The innovation was in the use of ion-exchange resin (polacrilex) in order to control the rate of release of nicotine during chewing. Fernö explained, \"Putting nicotine into chewing gum is not an invention. Fixing the nicotine to an ion exchange resin and putting that in a chewing gum to enable the chewer to control the rate of release—that is an invention\". The same year Håkan Westling, Professor of Clinical Physiology at Lund University, started the first clinical trials of the gum as an aid to smoking cessation at the university hospital. His findings were presented at the Second World Conference on Smoking and Health in London and were published in 1973 in the journal \"Psychopharmacologia\" together with an article by Fernö.\n\nNicotine chewing gum was presented at the Third World Conference on Smoking and Health in New York in 1975 by Fernö in partnership with the British researcher Michael Russell from the Institute of Psychiatry, who pioneered the measurement of blood nicotine levels. Russell and his colleagues at the Addiction Research Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry became involved in further research into nicotine gum through randomised controlled trials funded by the British Medical Research Council and the UK Department of Health and Social Security.\n\nNicorette was registered as a drug in Switzerland in 1978, in Canada in 1979, and in the UK in 1980. It was registered in Sweden in 1981. Initially the Swedish Medical Products Agency declined to approve Nicorette as a medicine because it considered smoking not an addiction, but a lifestyle choice; and the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare regarded orally consumed nicotine products not as medicine but as foodstuffs.\n\nOn January 13, 1984 Nicorette chewing gum was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration after a 34-month review. It was brought to the US market by Marion Merrell Dow under licence from AB Leo.\n\nIn 2016 it was the third biggest selling branded over-the-counter medication sold in Great Britain, with sales of £66.0 million.\n\nThe Nicorette Patch was introduced to the market in 1991 and the nasal spray in 1994.\n\nIn 1996 the FDA approved the switch of Nicorette gum and the NicoDerm CQ transdermal nicotine patch to over-the-counter status in the US.\n\nThe Nicorette inhaler was launched in 1996 and Nicorette Microtab (sublingual tablets) in 1999.\n\nIn 2002 the FDA changed the status of Commit lozenges to over the counter in the US.\n\nIn 2004 Nicorette launched Peppermint, the first coated nicotine gum. A shell coating containing a sugar substitute (xylitol) and flavouring masks the nicotine taste. In 2005 Nicorette introduced Fresh Mint chewing gum.\n\nIn December 2008 Nicorette introduced a new semi-transparent nicotine patch under the trade name \"Invisipatch\". As stated by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, in addition to this more discreet patch to encourage better customer compliance, new Nicorette transdermal patches have been developed to: reduce patch size; add a higher dosage strength of 25 mg of nicotine to the previously available 5, 10 and 15 mg; and increase the proportion of bioavailable nicotine).\n\nIn 2009 Nicorette introduced \"Icy White\" chewing gum with teeth whitening and Nicorette Mentolmint, a chewing gum with softer menthol taste.\n\nAt the end of November 2010 Nicorette introduced QuickMist 1 mg mouthspray, which provides more rapid absorption of nicotine than lozenges or gum.\n\nIn January 2011 Nicorette UK launched the ActiveStop mobile app for iOS featuring target setting, a wish list, distractions, achievement sharing, information and games.\n\nNicorette has been sponsoring yacht racing since 1993 when it partnered with Ludde Ingvall, a Finnish-born Swede who started a non-smoking team in 1991.\n\nIn 1995 the Nicorette team was banned from the Cape to Rio Race, sponsored by the tobacco company Rothmans. The captain of \"Nicorette\" protested against the decision, saying that \"Rothmans is scared of the boat and the healthy lifestyle it seeks to promote\". A spokesperson for the organizing committee of the race later admitted that the yacht was barred because they considered the product to be in competition with the sponsor's product. In the same year the yacht won the Fastnet Race.\n\nIn 1997 the yacht broke the Transatlantic mono-hull record, covering the route from New York City to Lizard Point (Great Britain) in 11 days 13:22.58.

{"id": "1946163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946163", "title": "Cryogenic hardening", "text": "Cryogenic hardening\n\nCryogenic hardening is a cryogenic treatment process where the material is cooled to approximately , usually using liquid nitrogen. It can have a profound effect on the mechanical properties of certain steels, provided their composition and prior heat treatment are such that they retain some austenite at room temperature. It is designed to increase the amount of martensite in the steel's crystal structure, increasing its strength and hardness, sometimes at the cost of toughness. Presently this treatment is being practiced over tool steels, high-carbon, high-chromium steels and in some cases to cemented carbide to obtain excellent wear resistance. Recent research shows that there is precipitation of fine carbides (eta carbides) in the matrix during this treatment which imparts very high wear resistance to the steels.\n\nThe transformation from austenite to martensite is mostly accomplished through quenching, but in general it is driven farther and farther toward completion as temperature decreases. In higher-alloy steels such as austenitic stainless steel, the onset of transformation can require temperatures much lower than room temperature. More commonly, an incomplete transformation occurs in the initial quench, so that cryogenic treatments merely enhance the effects of prior quenching. However, since martensite is a non-equilibrium phase on the iron-iron carbide phase diagram, it has not been shown that warming the part after the cryogenic treatment results in the re-transformation of the induced martensite back to austenite or to ferrite plus cementite, negating the hardening effect.\n\nThe transformation between these phases is instantaneous and not dependent upon diffusion, and also that this treatment causes more complete hardening rather than moderating extreme hardness, both of which make the term \"cryogenic tempering\" technically incorrect.\n\nHardening need not be due to martensitic transformation, but can also be accomplished by cold work at cryogenic temperatures. The defects introduced by plastic deformation at these low temperatures are often quite different from the dislocations that usually form at room temperature, and produce materials changes that in some ways resemble the effects of shock hardening. While this process is more effective than traditional cold work, it serves mainly as a theoretical test bed for more economical processes such as explosive forging.\n\nMany alloys that do not undergo martensitic transformation have been subjected to the same treatments as steels—that is, cooled with no provisions for cold work. If any benefit is seen from such a process, one plausible explanation is that thermal expansion causes minor but permanent deformation of the material.\n\n"}

He has a broad range of experience as a concert promoter, record executive, internet entrepreneur, and artist manager. He has also been deeply involved in the intersection of music and technology since the earliest days of the internet.\n\nRennie began his music career working as a booking agent at USC. After dropping out of college in 1980 he decided to start his own concert promotion company called Steve Rennie Presents after being passed over for a job in the mailroom at William Morris because he had not completed college. For the next 2 1/2 years he promoted a number of up and coming 'new wave' bands including the Motels, The Plimsouls, Adam Ant, X, the Blasters, Mötley Crüe and INXS in secondary markets outside LA. On New Year's Eve 1983, he had his first big breakthrough in LA booking The Motels at the Beverly Theater in Beverly Hills, CA, getting the nod to promote show over the big promoters in town. By 1983 he had caught the attention of Southern California's leading concert promotion, Avalon Attractions, who offered him a chance to join the company which he accepted. He soon rose to the ranks to become the Senior VP at Avalon Attractions. In 1990 he left Avalon Attractions to start his first incarnation of REN Management Corporation, an artist management firm where he managed a number of top alternative bands including Dramarama, The Wonder Stuff, Ned's Atomic Dustbin, , and Primal Scream. In 1994, he accepted an offer from then Epic Records President and now One Direction Manager, Richard Griffiths, where he became Senior Vice President/GM.While at Epic Records he met and helped sign a young So Cal band called Incubus. While at Epic he took the band under his wing and helped them build the foundation of what became one of the most successful alt rock bands of the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 1998 Rennie left Epic to become one of the founding members of one of the pioneering internet music start-ups, ARTISTdirect. When Rennie informed the members of Incubus that he would be leaving Epic to join his friends Marc Geiger and Don Muller at Artist Direct, guitarist Mike Einziger asked Rennie to co-manage the band with their then manager, Mark Shoffner. Rennie accepted the offer and stayed at ARTISTdirect until 2000 when he left the company to manage the band on a full-time basis. Shortly thereafter, the band released their breakthrough multi platinum selling album MAKE YOURSELF. Over the next 14 years, the band went on to have a #1 Billboard Top 100 album and (2) #2 Top 100 album and a dozen Top 10 alternative radio hits. During his tenure as manager the band built a huge live touring business around the world and one of the most dedicated and loyal fan bases in the music scene. In January 2014, the band and Rennie parted company. Today, all of Rennie's focus is towards his new venture Renmanmb, which is a mecca for all aspiring artist and music business professionals to come and learn the \"real\" music business from some of the smartest, most talented, and successful people in the music industry.\n"}

A school of arts existed about 1200, in which medicine and law were soon taught, with a strong commitment expressed by official documents of the City Council of Perugia. Before 1300 there were several \"universitates scholiarum\". Jacobus de Belviso, a famous civil jurist, taught here from 1316 to 1321. By Bull of August 1, 1318, John XXII granted the privilege of conferring degrees in civil and canon law, and on February 18, 1321, in medicine and arts.\n\nOn May 19, 1355, the Emperor Charles IV issued a Bull confirming the papal erection and raising it to the rank of an imperial university. This unusual mark of favour was given to assist Perugia after the terrible plague years 1348–49.

Gregory XI, by Brief of October 11, 1371 gave the privileges of a studium generale to the new faculty of theology. This faculty was suppressed and its property merged in the university in 1811. To this foundation the \"Sapienza nuova\" was transferred in 1829. The latter was founded by Benedetto Guidalotti, Bishop of Recanati in 1426, with Martin V's approval, as the \"Collegio di S. Girolamo\". It was a free hostel for impecunious strangers who wished to study law and medicine. Suppressed by the French in 1798, it was reopened in 1807 by Pius VII as the \"Collegio Pio\". In the Constitution of August 27, 1824, Leo XII made this the chief college of the university.\n\nWith the unification of Italy in 1860 the University of Perugia was established under the jurisdiction of the Rector and the Town Council, who issued statutes subject to approval by the Government. From 1944 to the present, the University of Perugia has achieved an outstanding reputation as one of the leading universities in Italy.\n\nSince the time of Napoleon I the university has occupied the old Olivetan convent of Monte Morcino.

Its companion, poem 51, is Catullus' version of another of Sappho's poems. In poem 11, Catullus asks his two friends, Furius and Aurelius, to, if they are willing to venture off to great distances, deliver a message to an unknown girl who is understood to be Lesbia. This message, unfortunately, is not a happy one, and sends a sign to Lesbia that Catullus no longer wants to be with her.\n\nFurius is also mentioned in poems 16, 23, and 26.\nAurelius is also mentioned in poems 15, 16, 21.\n\nIn Catullus 11, there is a different tone in the way Catullus addresses his friends Furius and Aurelius than how they are usually mentioned in other poems. In other poems, they are usually addressed by Catullus in a condescending manner, but in this poem, he addresses them in a very serious manner. Also, in the first three stanzas, Catullus implies that he will go with Furius and Aurelius to several different places around the world, trying to express how good of friends they are, but, ironically, he asks them to just walk across the street and break up with his girlfriend without him. Another unusual thing Catullus does in this poem is that he compliments Caesar in line 10. This in very uncharacteristic of Catullus as compared to his other poems, as he is usually not very complimentary of Caesar. Throughout the first half of the poem, Catullus builds a very romantic atmosphere through his writing. But, in the second half, the mood of the poem turns drastically, as he starts insulting Lesbia.\n\nScholars are divided on the interpretation of how Catullus addresses Furius and Aurelius in this poem. Some think that he is being serious and truly holds Furius and Aurelius as some of his closest friends that he will have until he dies. Others believe that Catullus has more of an ironic tone. For example, Catullus' tone switches dramatically in the second half of the poem, as he asks them to just walk across the street to Catullus after naming all these far away places to go to. This hints that Catullus' tone might be more on the ironical side. But, in general, it can be argued either way, as it seems he is serious in the first half, but this seriousness is deflated in the last 2 stanzas of the poem.\n"}
{"id": "1946196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946196", "title": "Islamic culture", "text": "Islamic culture\n\nIslamic culture and Muslim culture refer to cultural practices common to historically Islamic people. The early forms of Muslim culture, from the Rashidun Caliphate to early Umayyad period, were predominantly Arab, Byzantine, Persian and Levantine. With the rapid expansion of the Islamic empires, Muslim culture has influenced and assimilated much from the Persian, Egyptian, Caucasian, Turkic, Mongol, South Asian, Malay, Somali, Berber, Indonesian, and Moro cultures.\n\nIslamic culture generally includes all the practices which have developed around the religion of Islam. There are variations in the application of Islamic beliefs in different cultures and traditions.\n\nArabic literature ( / ALA-LC: \"al-Adab al-‘Arabī\") is the writing, both prose and poetry, produced by writers in the Arabic language. The Arabic word used for literature is \"\"Adab\"\", which is derived from a meaning of etiquette, and which implies politeness, culture and enrichment.\n\nArabic literature emerged in the 5th century with only fragments of the written language appearing before then. The Qur'an,(the holy book of Islam) widely regarded by people as the finest piece of literature in the Arabic language, would have the greatest lasting effect on Arabic culture and its literature. Arabic literature flourished during the Islamic Golden Age, but has remained vibrant to the present day, with poets and prose-writers across the Arab world, as well as rest of the world, achieving increasing success.\n\nPersian literature comprises oral compositions and written texts in the Persian language and it is one of the world's oldest literatures. It spans over two-and-a-half millennia. Its sources have been within Greater Iran including present-day Iran, Iraq, syria, Afghanistan, the Caucasus, and Turkey, regions of Central Asia (such as Tajikistan) and South Asia where the Persian language has historically been either the native or official language. For instance, Rumi, one of best-loved Persian poets born in Balkh (in what is now the modern-day Afghanistan) or Vakhsh (in what is now the modern-day Tajikistan), wrote in Persian and lived in Konya, then the capital of the Seljuks in Anatolia. The Ghaznavids conquered large territories in Central and South Asia and adopted Persian as their court language. There is thus Persian literature from Iran, Mesopotamia, Azerbaijan, the wider Caucasus, Turkey, western parts of Pakistan, India, Tajikistan and other parts of Central Asia. Not all Persian literature is written in Persian, as some consider works written by ethnic Persians in other languages, such as Greek and Arabic, to be included. At the same time, not all literature written in Persian is written by ethnic Persians or Iranians, as Turkic, Caucasian, and Indic poets and writers have also used the Persian language in the environment of Persianate cultures.\n\nDescribed as one of the great literatures of humanity, including Goethe's assessment of it as one of the four main bodies of world literature, Persian literature has its roots in surviving works of Middle Persian and Old Persian, the latter of which date back as far as 522 BCE, the date of the earliest surviving Achaemenid inscription, the Behistun Inscription. The bulk of surviving Persian literature, however, comes from the times following the Arab conquest of Persia c. 650 CE. After the Abbasids came to power (750 CE), the Iranians became the scribes and bureaucrats of the Arab empire and, increasingly, also its writers and poets. The New Persian language literature arose and flourished in Khorasan and Transoxiana because of political reasons, early Iranian dynasties such as the Tahirids and Samanids being based in Khorasan.\n\nPersian poets such as Ferdowsi, Sa'di, Hafiz, Attar, Nezami, Rumi and Omar Khayyam are also known in the West and have influenced the literature of many countries.\n\nFor a thousand years, since the invasion of India by the Ghaznavids, the Persian-Islamic culture of the eastern half of the Islamic world started to influence the Indian culture. Persian was the official language of most Indian empires such as the Ghaznavids, the Delhi Sultanate, the Bengal Sultanate, the Deccan Sultanates (such as the Qutb Shahi dynasty) and the Mughal Empire. Persian artistic forms in literature and poetry such as ghazals have come to significantly affect Urdu and other Indian literature.\nMore Persian literature was produced in India than in the Iranian world. As late as the 20th century, Allama Iqbal chose Persian for some of his major poetic works. The first Persian language newspaper was also published in India, given that printing machines were first implemented in India.\n\nIn Bengal, the Baul tradition of mystic music and poetry merged Sufism with many local images. The most prominent poets were Hason Raja and Lalon Shah.\n\nDuring the early 14th century, the liberal poet Kazi Nazrul Islam espoused intense spiritual rebellion against oppression, fascism and religious fundamentalism; and also wrote a highly acclaimed collection of Bengali ghazals. \"Sultana's Dream\" by Begum Rokeya, an Islamic feminist, is one earliest works of feminist science fiction.\n\nFrom the 11th century, there was a growing body of Islamic literature in the Turkic languages. However, for centuries to come the official language in Turkish-speaking areas would remain Persian. In Anatolia, with the advent of the Seljuks, the practise and usage of Persian in the region would be strongly revived. A branch of the Seljuks, the Sultanate of Rum, took Russian language, art and letters to Anatolia. They adopted Persian language as the official language of the empire. The Ottomans, which can \"roughly\" be seen as their eventual successors, took this tradition over. Persian was the official court language of the empire, and for some time, the official language of the empire, though the lingua franca amongst common people from the 15th/16th century would become Turkish as well as having laid an active \"foundation\" for the Turkic language as early as the 4th century (see Turkification). After a period of several centuries, Ottoman Turkish (which was highly Arabo-Persianised itself) had developed towards a fully accepted language of literature, which was even able to satisfy the demands of a scientific presentation. However, the number of Persian and Arabic loanwords contained in those works increased at times up to 88%. However, Turkish was proclaimed the official language of the Karamanids in the 17th century, though it didn't manage to become the official language in a wider area or larger empire until the advent of the Ottomans. With the establishment of the Ottoman Empire, Ottoman Turkish (a highly Arabo-Persianised version of Oghuz Turkic) grew in importance in both poetry and prose becoming, by the beginning of the 18th century, the official language of the Empire. Unlike India, where Persian remained the official and principal literary language of both Muslim and Hindu states until the 19th century.\n\nPublic Islamic art is traditionally non-representational, except for the widespread use of plant forms, usually in varieties of the spiralling arabesque. These are often combined with Islamic calligraphy, geometric patterns in styles that are typically found in a wide variety of media, from small objects in ceramic or metalwork to large decorative schemes in tiling on the outside and inside of large buildings, including mosques. However, there is a long tradition in Islamic art of the depiction of human and animal figures, especially in painting and small anonymous relief figures as part of a decorative scheme. Almost all Persian miniatures (as opposed to decorative illuminations) include figures, often in large numbers, as do their equivalents in Arab, Mughal and Ottoman miniatures. But miniatures in books or muraqqa albums were private works owned by the elite. Larger figures in monumental sculpture are exceptionally rare until recent times, and portraiture showing realistic representations of individuals (and animals) did not develop until the late 16th century in miniature painting, especially Mughal miniatures. Manuscripts of the Qur'an and other sacred texts have always been strictly kept free of such figures, but there is a long tradition of the depiction of Muhammad and other religious figures in books of history and poetry; since the 20th century Muhammad has mostly been shown as though wearing a veil hiding his face, and many earlier miniatures were overpainted to use this convention.\n\nSome interpretations of Islam include a ban of depiction of animate beings, also known as aniconism. Islamic aniconism stems in part from the prohibition of idolatry and in part from the belief that creation of living forms is God's prerogative. Although the Quran does not explicitly prohibit visual representation of any living being, it uses the word \"musawwir\" (maker of forms, artist) as an epithet of God. The corpus of hadith (sayings attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad) contains more explicit prohibitions of images of living beings, challenging painters to \"breathe life\" into their images and threatening them with punishment on the Day of Judgment. Muslims have interpreted these prohibitions in different ways in different times and places. Religious Islamic art has been typically characterized by the absence of figures and extensive use of calligraphic, geometric and abstract floral patterns. However, representations of Muhammad (in some cases, with his face concealed) and other religious figures are found in some manuscripts from lands to the east of Anatolia, such as Persia and India. These pictures were meant to illustrate the story and not to infringe on the Islamic prohibition of idolatry, but many Muslims regard such images as forbidden. In secular art of the Muslim world, representations of human and animal forms historically flourished in nearly all Islamic cultures, although, partly because of opposing religious sentiments, figures in paintings were often stylized, giving rise to a variety of decorative figural designs.\n\nIslamic calligraphy is the artistic practice of handwriting and calligraphy, based upon the alphabet in the lands sharing a common Islamic cultural heritage. It includes Arabic Calligraphy, Ottoman, and Persian calligraphy. It is known in Arabic as \"khatt Islami\" (), meaning Islamic line, design, or construction.\n\nThe development of Islamic calligraphy is strongly tied to the Qur'an; chapters and excerpts from the Qur'an are a common and almost universal text upon which Islamic calligraphy is based. However, Islamic calligraphy is not limited to strictly religious subjects, objects, or spaces. Like all Islamic art, it encompasses a diverse array of works created in a wide variety of contexts. The prevalence of calligraphy in Islamic art is not directly related to its non-figural tradition; rather, it reflects the centrality of the notion of writing and written text in Islam. It is noteworthy, for instance, that the Prophet Muhammad is related to have said: \"The first thing God created was the pen.\"\n\nIslamic calligraphy developed from two major styles: Kufic and Naskh. There are several variations of each, as well as regionally specific styles. Islamic calligraphy has also been incorporated into modern art beginning with the post-colonial period in the Middle East, as well as the more recent style of calligraffiti.\n\nIslamic architecture is the range of architectural styles of buildings associated with Islam. It encompasses both secular and religious styles from the early history of Islam to the present day. Early Islamic architecture was influenced by Roman, Byzantine, Persian and all other lands which the Muslims conquered in the 7th and 8th centuries. Further east, it was also influenced by Chinese and Indian architecture as Islam spread to the Southeast Asia. Later it developed distinct characteristics in the form of buildings, and the decoration of surfaces with Islamic calligraphy and geometric and interlace patterned ornament. The principal Islamic architectural types for large or public buildings are: the Mosque, the Tomb, the Palace and the Fort. From these four types, the vocabulary of Islamic architecture is derived and used for other buildings such as public baths, fountains and domestic architecture.\n\nIslamic architecture may be identified with the following design elements, which were inherited from the first mosque built by Muhammad in Medina, as well as from other pre-Islamic features adapted from churches and synagogues.\n\nWhilst theatre is permitted by Islam, Islam does not allow for any performances to depict God, Muhammad, his companions, the angels or matters detailed in the religion that are unseen.\n\nThe most popular forms of theatre in the medieval Islamic world were puppet theatre (which included hand puppets, shadow plays and marionette productions) and live passion plays known as \"ta'ziya\", where actors re-enact episodes from Muslim history. In particular, Shia Islamic plays revolved around the \"shaheed\" (martyrdom) of Ali's sons Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. Live secular plays were known as \"akhraja\", recorded in medieval \"adab\" literature, though they were less common than puppetry and \"ta'zieh\" theatre.\n\nOne of the oldest, and most enduring, forms of puppet theatre is the Wayang of Indonesia. Although it narrates primarily pre-Islamic legends, it is also an important stage for Islamic epics such as the adventures of Amir Hamzah (pictured). Islamic Wayang is known as \"Wayang Sadat\" or \"Wayang Menak\".\n\nKaragoz, the Turkish Shadow Theatre has influenced puppetry widely in the region. It is thought to have passed from China by way of India. Later it was taken by the Mongols from the Chinese and transmitted to the Turkish peoples of Central Russia. Thus the art of Shadow Theatre was brought to Anatolia by the Turkish people emigrating from Central Asia. Other scholars claim that shadow theatre came to Anatolia in the 16th century from Egypt. The advocates of this view claim that when Yavuz Sultan Selim conquered Egypt in 1517, he saw shadow theatre performed during an extacy party put on in his honour. Yavuz Sultan Selim was so impressed with it that he took the puppeteer back to his palace in Istanbul. There his 47-year-old son, later Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent, developed an interest in the plays and watched them a great deal. Thus shadow theatre found its way into the Ottoman palaces.\n\nIn other areas the style of shadow puppetry known as \"khayal al-zill\" – an intentionally metaphorical term whose meaning is best translated as ‘shadows of the imagination’ or ‘shadow of fancy' survives. This is a shadow play with live music ..”the accompaniment of drums, tambourines and flutes...also...“special effects” – smoke, fire, thunder, rattles, squeaks, thumps, and whatever else might elicit a laugh or a shudder from his audience\"\n\nIn Iran puppets are known to have existed much earlier than 1000, but initially only glove and string puppets were popular in Iran. Other genres of puppetry emerged during the Qajar era (18th–19th century) as influences from Turkey spread to the region. \"Kheimeh Shab-Bazi\" is a Persian traditional puppet show which is performed in a small chamber by a musical performer and a storyteller called a \"morshed\" or \"naghal\". These shows often take place alongside storytelling in traditional tea and coffee-houses (\"Ghahve-Khave\"). The dialogue takes place between the morshed and the puppets. Puppetry remains very popular in Iran, the touring opera Rostam and Sohrab puppet opera being a recent example.\n\nThe Royal Opera House in Muscat, Oman. It is considered to be the first opera house linking Islamic culture with classical music.\n\nMany forms of dancing arts are practised in Muslim cultures, both in religious and secular contexts (such as folk and tribal dances, court dances, dances of celebration during weddings and festivals, belly dancing, \"etc.\").\n\nSome scholars of Islamic \"fiqh\" pronounced gender based rulings on dance, making it permissible for women within a female only environment, as is often performed at celebrations, but discouraging men to engage in it. Other classical authorities including Al-Ghazzali and Al-Nawawi allow it without this distinction, but criticised dancing which is \"languid\" or excites carnal lusts.\n\nMost of the religious orders (\"tariqa\") which dominate traditional Muslim religious life practice ritualised forms of dance in the context of \"dhikr\" ceremonies. \"Dhikr\", \"recollection\" (of God) is a meditative form of worship different from ritual prayer where the seeker focuses all of his senses and thoughts on God in the hope of attaining \"maarifat\" (experiential knowledge of God) and triggering mystic states within him- or herself. \"Dhikr\" can be performed individually or with like-minded followers under the direction of a sheikh, and can involve silent meditation or repetition and visualisation of sacred words such as the 99 names of God or Quranic phrases, and may be done at rest or with rhythmic movements and controlling one's breath. Traditional Islamic orders have developed varied \"dhikr\" exercises including sometimes highly elaborate ritual dances accompanied by Sufi poetry and classical music.\n\nAl-Ghazzali discussed the use of music and dancing in \"dhikr\" and the mystical states it induces in worshippers, as well as regulating the etiquette attached to these ceremonies, in his short treatise on Islamic spirituality \"The Alchemy of Happiness\" and in his highly influential work \"The Revival of the Religious Sciences\". Al-Ghazzali emphasized how the practices of music and dance are beneficial to religious seekers, as long as their hearts are pure before engaging in these practices.\n\nNotable examples include the Mevlevi Order founded by Jalaluddin Rumi, which was the main Sunni order of the Ottoman empire, and its \"sama\" ritual (known in the West as \"the whirling dervishes\"). The Mevlevi order, its rituals and Ottoman classical music has been banned in Turkey through much of the 20th century as part of the country's drive towards secular \"modernisation\", and the order's properties have been expropriated and the country's mosques put out of its control, which has radically diminished its influence in modern Turkey. In 2008, UNESCO confirmed the \"Mevlevi Sama Ceremony\" of Turkey as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity, and the practice is now regaining interest.\n\nIn Egypt and the Levant, the Mevlevi form of \"sama\" is known as tannoura and has been adopted (with some modifications) by other Sufi orders as well.\n\nThe Chishti order, traditionally the dominant Islamic institution in Afghanistan and the Indian subcontinent and the most ancient of the major Sufi orders, also practices forms of \"sama\" similar to the Mevlevis, as well as other forms of devotional dance such as \"dhamaal\". The order is strongly associated with the development of Hindustani classical music and semi-classical devotional genres such as \"qawwali\" through famed pioneer figures such as Amir Khusrow. The Chishti order remains one of the largest and strongest Muslim religious orders in the world by far, retaining a vast influence on the spirituality and culture of around 500 million Muslims living in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nOther examples of devotional dance are found in the Maghreb where it is associated with gnawa music, as well as Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. The Naqshbandi order, predominant among Iran's Sunni minority, is a notable exception in that they do not use music and dancing in the context of \"dhikr\".\n\nIn addition to these strictly religious forms of dance, colourful dancing processions traditionally take place in Muslim communities during weddings and public celebrations such as \"Mawlid\", \"Eid el-Adha\", and so on. Many Islamic cultures have also developed classical forms of dance in the context for instance of Mughal, Ottoman, Persian and Javanese court cultures, as well as innumerable local folk and tribal dances (for instance amongst Bedouin, Tuareg and Pashto peoples), and other forms of dance used for entertainment or sometimes healing such as belly dancing (principally associated with Egyptian culture).\n\nAlthough \"tariqas\" and their rituals have been an omnipresent part of Muslim life for most of Islam's history and were largely responsible for the spread of Islam throughout the world, their following and influence has sharply declined since the late 19th century, having been vigorously opposed and combated in turns by the French and British colonial administrations and by Muslim modernists and secularists like Kemal Ataturk, and in recent decades have been the target of vocal opposition by the fundamentalist Wahhabi sect promoted by Saudi Arabia (where most of the heritage associated with Sufism and \"tariqa\" was physically destroyed by the state in the 1930s). Wahhabi militant groups such as ISIS and the Taliban are repeatedly targeting \"dhikr\" ceremonies in terrorist attacks, notably in Egypt and Pakistan.\n\nMany Muslims are very familiar to listening to music.\nThe classic heartland of Islam is Arabia as well as other parts of the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia. Because Islam is a multicultural religion, the musical expression of its adherents is diverse.\n\n\nThe Seljuk Turks, a nomadic tribe that converted to Islam, conquered Anatolia (now Turkey), and held the Caliphate as the Ottoman Empire, also had a strong influence on Islamic music. See Turkish classical music.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa, India, and the Malay Archipelago also have large Muslim populations, but these areas have had less influence than the heartland on the various traditions of Islamic music. For South India, see: Mappila Songs, Duff Muttu.\n\nAll these regions were connected by trade long before the Islamic conquests of the 7th century and later, and it is likely that musical styles travelled the same routes as trade goods. However, lacking recordings, we can only speculate as to the pre-Islamic music of these areas. Islam must have had a great influence on music, as it united vast areas under the first caliphs, and facilitated trade between distant lands. Certainly the Sufis, brotherhoods of Muslim mystics, spread their music far and wide.\n\nSee articles on Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha, Ashurah (see also Hosay and Tabuik), Mawlid, Lailat al Miraj and Shab-e-baraat.\n\nIn a Muslim family, the birth of a child is attended with some religious ceremonies. Immediately after the birth, the words of Adhan is pronounced in the right ear of the child. In the seventh day, the aquiqa ceremony is performed, in which an animal is sacrificed and its meat is distributed among the poor. The head of the child is also shaved, and an amount of money equaling the weight of the child's hair is donated to the poor. Apart from fulfilling the basic needs of food, shelter, and education, the parents or the elderly members of family also undertake the task of teaching moral qualities, religious knowledge, and religious practices to the children. Marriage, which serves as the foundation of a Muslim family, is a civil contract which consists of an offer and acceptance between two qualified parties in the presence of two witnesses. The groom is required to pay a bridal gift (\"mahr\") to the bride, as stipulated in the contract. With Muslims coming from diverse backgrounds including 49 Muslim-majority countries, plus a strong presence as large minorities throughout the world there are many variations on Muslim weddings. Generally in a Muslim family, a woman's sphere of operation is the home and a man's corresponding sphere is the outside world. However, in practice, this separation is not as rigid as it appears. \n\nCertain religious rites are performed during and after the death of a Muslim. Those near a dying man encourage him to pronounce the Shahada as Muslims want their last word to be their profession of faith. After the death, the body is appropriately bathed by the members of the same gender and then enshrouded in a threefold white garment called \"kafan\". Placing the body on a bier, it is first taken to a mosque where funeral prayer is offered for the dead person, and then to the graveyard for burial.\n\nMany practices fall in the category of \"adab\", or Islamic etiquette. This includes greeting others with \"\"as-salamu 'alaykum\"\" (\"peace be unto you\"), saying \"bismillah\" (\"in the name of God\") before meals, and using only the right hand for eating and drinking. Islamic hygienic practices mainly fall into the category of personal cleanliness and health. Circumcision of male offspring is also practiced in Islam. Islamic burial rituals include saying the \"Salat al-Janazah\" (\"funeral prayer\") over the bathed and enshrouded dead body, and burying it in a grave. Muslims are restricted in their diet. Prohibited foods include pork products, blood, carrion, and alcohol. All meat must come from a herbivorous animal slaughtered in the name of God by a Muslim, Jew, or Christian, with the exception of game that one has hunted or fished for oneself. Food permissible for Muslims is known as halal food.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1946204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946204", "title": "Music industry", "text": "Music industry\n\nThe music industry consists of the companies and individuals that earn money by creating new songs and pieces and selling live concerts and shows, audio and video recordings, compositions and sheet music, and the organizations and associations that aid and represent music creators. Among the many individuals and organizations that operate in the industry are: the songwriters and composers who create new songs and musical pieces; the singers, musicians, conductors and bandleaders who perform the music; the companies and professionals who create and sell recorded music and/or sheet music (e.g., music publishers, music producers, recording studios, engineers, record labels, retail and online music stores, performance rights organizations); and those that help organize and present live music performances (sound engineers, booking agents, promoters, music venues, road crew).\n\nThe industry also includes a range of professionals who assist singers and musicians with their music careers (talent managers, artists and repertoire managers, business managers, entertainment lawyers); those who broadcast audio or video music content (satellite, Internet radio stations, broadcast radio and TV stations); music journalists and music critics; DJs; music educators and teachers; musical instrument manufacturers; as well as many others. In addition to the businesses and artists who work in the music industry to make a profit or income, there is a range of organizations that also play an important role in the music industry, including musician's unions (e.g., American Federation of Musicians), not-for-profit performance-rights organizations (e.g., American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers) and other associations (e.g., International Alliance for Women in Music, a non-profit organization that advocates for women composers and musicians).\n\nThe modern Western music industry emerged between the 1930s and 1950s, when records replaced sheet music as the most important product in the music business. In the commercial world, \"the recording industry\"—a reference to recording performances of songs and pieces and selling the recordings–began to be used as a loose synonym for \"the music industry\". In the 2000s, a majority of the music market is controlled by three major corporate labels: the French-owned Universal Music Group, the Japanese-owned Sony Music Entertainment, and the US-owned Warner Music Group. Labels outside of these three major labels are referred to as independent labels (or \"indies\"). The largest portion of the live music market for concerts and tours is controlled by Live Nation, the largest promoter and music venue owner. Live Nation is a former subsidiary of iHeartMedia Inc, which is the largest owner of radio stations in the United States.\n\nIn the first decades of the 2000s, the music industry underwent drastic changes with the advent of widespread digital distribution of music via the Internet (which includes both illegal file sharing of songs and legal music purchases in online music stores). A conspicuous indicator of these changes is total music sales: since 2000, sales of recorded music have dropped off substantially while live music has increased in importance. In 2011, the largest recorded music retailer in the world was now a digital, Internet-based platform operated by a computer company: Apple Inc.'s online iTunes Store. Since 2011, the Music Industry has seen consistent sales growth with streaming now generating more revenue per annum than digital downloads. Spotify and Apple lead the way with online digital streaming.\n\nPrinted music in Europe:\n\nMusic publishing using machine-printed sheet music developed during the Renaissance music era in the mid-15th century. The development of music publication followed the evolution of printing technologies that were first developed for printing regular books. After the mid-15th century, mechanical techniques for printing sheet music were first developed. The earliest example, a set of liturgical chants, dates from about 1465, shortly after the Gutenberg Bible was printed. Prior to this time, music had to be copied out by hand. To copy music notation by hand was a very costly, labor-intensive and time-consuming process, so it was usually undertaken only by monks and priests seeking to preserve sacred music for the church. The few collections of secular (non-religious) music that are extant were commissioned and owned by wealthy aristocrats. Examples include the Squarcialupi Codex of Italian Trecento music and the Chantilly Codex of French Ars subtilior music.\n\nThe use of printing enabled sheet music to reproduced much more quickly and at a much lower cost than hand-copying music notation. This helped musical styles to spread to other cities and countries more quickly, and it also enabled music to be spread to more distant areas. Prior to the invention of music printing, a composer's music might only be known in the city she lived in and its surrounding towns, because only wealthy aristocrats would be able to afford to have hand copies made of her music. With music printing, though, a composer's music could be printed and sold at a relatively low cost to purchasers from a wide geographic area. As sheet music of major composer's pieces and songs began to be printed and distributed in a wider area, this enabled composers and listeners to hear new styles and forms of music. A German composer could buy songs written by an Italian or English composer, and an Italian composer could buy pieces written by Dutch composers and learn how they wrote music. This led to more blending of musical styles from different countries and regions.\n\nThe pioneer of modern music printing was Ottaviano Petrucci (born in Fossombrone in 1466 – died in 1539 in Venice ), a printer and publisher who was able to secure a twenty-year monopoly on printed music in Venice during the 16th century. Venice was one of the major business and music centers during this period. His \"Harmonice Musices Odhecaton\", a collection of chansons printed in 1501, is commonly misidentified as the first book of sheet music printed from movable type. Actually that distinction belongs to the Roman printer Ulrich Han's \"Missale Romanum\" of 1476. Nevertheless, Petrucci's later work was extraordinary for the complexity of his white mensural notation and the smallness of his font. He printed the first book of polyphony (music with two or more independent melodic lines) using movable type. He also published numerous works by the most highly regarded composers of the Renaissance, including Josquin des Prez and Antoine Brumel. He flourished by focusing on Flemish works, rather than Italian, as they were very popular throughout Europe during the Renaissance music era. His printing shop used the triple-impression method, in which a sheet of paper was pressed three times. The first impression was the staff lines, the second the words, and the third the notes. This method produced very clean and readable results, although it was time-consuming and expensive.\n\nUntil the 18th century, the processes of formal composition and of the printing of music took place for the most part with the support of patronage from aristocracies and churches. In the mid-to-late 18th century, performers and composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart began to seek more commercial opportunities to market their music and performances to the general public. After Mozart's death, his wife (Constanze Weber) continued the process of commercialization of his music through an unprecedented series of memorial concerts, selling his manuscripts, and collaborating with her second husband, Georg Nissen, on a biography of Mozart.\nIn the 19th century, sheet-music publishers dominated the music industry. Prior to the invention of sound recording technologies, the main way for music lovers to hear new symphonies and opera arias (songs) was to buy the sheet music (often arranged for piano or for a small chamber music group) and perform the music in a living room, using friends who were amateur musicians and singers. In the United States, the music industry arose in tandem with the rise of \"black face\" minstrelsy. Blackface is a form of theatrical makeup used predominantly by non-black performers to represent a black person. The practice gained popularity during the 19th century and contributed to the spread of negative racial stereotypes of African-American people.\n\nIn the late part of the century the group of music publishers and songwriters which dominated popular music in the United States became known as Tin Pan Alley. The name originally referred to a specific place: West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, and a plaque (see below) on the sidewalk on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth commemorates it. The start of Tin Pan Alley is usually dated to about 1885, when a number of music publishers set up shop in the same district of Manhattan. The end of Tin Pan Alley is less clear-cut. Some date it to the start of the Great Depression in the 1930s when the phonograph and radio supplanted sheet music as the driving force of American popular music, while others consider Tin Pan Alley to have continued into the 1950s when earlier styles of American popular music were upstaged by the rise of rock & roll.\n\nAt the dawn of the early 20th century, the development of sound recording began to function as a disruptive technology to the commercial interests which published sheet music. During the sheet music era, if a regular person wanted to hear popular new songs, he or she would buy the sheet music and play it at home on a piano, or learn the song at home while playing the accompaniment part on piano or guitar. Commercially released phonograph records of musical performances, which became available starting in the late 1880s, and later the onset of widespread radio broadcasting, starting in the 1920s, forever changed the way music was heard and listened to. Opera houses, concert halls, and clubs continued to produce music and musicians and singers continued to perform live, but the power of radio allowed bands, ensembles and singers who had previously performed only in one region to become popular on a nationwide and sometimes even a worldwide scale. Moreover, whereas attendance at the top symphony and opera concerts was formerly restricted to high-income people in a pre-radio world, with broadcast radio, a much larger wider range of people, including lower and middle-income people could hear the best orchestras, big bands, popular singers and opera shows.\n\nThe \"record industry\" eventually replaced the sheet music publishers as the music industry's largest force. A multitude of record labels came and went. Some noteworthy labels of the earlier decades include the Columbia Records, Crystalate, Decca Records, Edison Bell, The Gramophone Company, Invicta, Kalliope, Pathé, Victor Talking Machine Company and many others. Many record companies died out as quickly as they had formed, and by the end of the 1980s, the \"Big six\" — EMI, CBS, BMG, PolyGram, WEA and MCA — dominated the industry. Sony bought CBS Records in 1987 and changed its name to Sony Music in 1991. In mid-1998, PolyGram Music Group merged with MCA Music Entertainment creating what we now know as Universal Music Group. Since then, Sony and BMG merged in 2004, and Universal took over the majority of EMI's recorded music interests in 2012. EMI Music Publishing, also once part of the now defunct British conglomerate, is now co-owned by Sony as a subsidiary of Sony/ATV Music Publishing. As in other industries, the record industry is characterised by many mergers and/or acquisitions, for the major companies as well as for middle sized business (recent example is given by the Belgium group PIAS and French group Harmonia Mundi).\n\nGenre-wise, music entrepreneurs expanded their industry models into areas like folk music, in which composition and performance had continued for centuries on an ad hoc self-supporting basis. Forming an independent record label, or \"indie\" label, or signing to such a label continues to be a popular choice for up-and-coming musicians, especially in genres like hardcore punk and extreme metal, despite the fact that indies cannot offer the same financial backing of major labels. Some bands prefer to sign with an indie label, because these labels typically give performers more artistic freedom.\n\nIn the first decade of the 2000s, digitally downloaded and streamed music became more popular than buying physical recordings (e.g. CDs, records and tapes). This gave consumers almost \"friction-less\" access to a wider variety of music than ever before, across multiple devices. At the same time, consumers spent less money on recorded music (both physically and digitally distributed) than they had in the 1990s. Total \"music-business\" revenues in the U.S. dropped by half, from a high of $14.6 billion in 1999 to $6.3 billion in 2009, according to Forrester Research.\nWorldwide revenues for CDs, vinyl, cassettes and digital downloads fell from $36.9 billion in 2000 to $15.9 billion in 2010 according to IFPI. \"The Economist\" and \"The New York Times\" reported that the downward trend was expected to continue for the foreseeable future. This dramatic decline in revenue has caused large-scale layoffs inside the traditional industry, driven some more venerable retailers (such as Tower Records) out of business and forced record companies, record producers, studios, recording engineers and musicians to seek new business models.\nIn response to the rise of widespread illegal file sharing of digital music-recordings, the record industry took aggressive legal action. In 2001 it succeeded in shutting down the popular music-website Napster, and threatened legal action against thousands of individuals who participated in sharing music-song sound-files. However, this failed to slow the decline in music-recording revenue and proved a public-relations disaster for the music industry. Some academic studies have even suggested that downloads did not cause the decline in sales of recordings. The 2008 British Music Rights survey showed that 80% of people in Britain wanted a legal peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing service, however only half of the respondents thought that the music's creators should be paid. The survey was consistent with the results of earlier research conducted in the United States, upon which the Open Music Model was based.\nLegal digital downloads became widely available with the debut of the Apple iTunes Store in 2003. The popularity of music distribution over the Internet has increased, and by 2011 digital music sales topped physical sales of music.\nAtlantic Records reports that digital sales have surpassed physical sales.\nHowever, as \"The Economist\" reported, \"paid digital downloads grew rapidly, but did not begin to make up for the loss of revenue from CDs\".\nAfter 2010, Internet-based services such as Deezer, Pandora, Spotify, and Apple's iTunes Radio began to offer subscription-based \"pay to stream\" services over the Internet. With streaming services, the user pays a subscription to a company for the right to listen to songs and other media from a library. Whereas with legal digital download services, the purchaser owns a digital copy of the song (which they can keep on their computer or on a digital media player), with streaming services, the user never downloads the song file or owns the song file. The subscriber can only listen to the song for as long as they continue to pay the streaming subscription. Once the user stops paying the subscription, they cannot listen to audio from the company's repositories anymore. Streaming services began to have a serious impact on the industry in 2014.\n\nSpotify, together with the music-streaming industry in general, faces some criticism from artists claiming they are not being fairly compensated for their work as downloaded-music sales decline and music-streaming increases. Unlike physical or download sales, which pay a fixed price per song or album, Spotify pays artists based on their \"market share\" (the number of streams for their songs as a proportion of total songs streamed on the service). Spotify distributes approximately 70% to rights-holders, who will then pay artists based on their individual agreements. The variable, and (some say) inadequate nature of this compensation, has led to criticism. Spotify reports paying on average US$0.006 to US$0.008 per stream. In response to concerns, Spotify claims that they are benefiting the music business by migrating \"them away from piracy and less monetised platforms and allowing them to generate far greater royalties than before\" by encouraging users to use their paid service.\n\nThe Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) revealed in its 2015 earnings report that streaming services were responsible for 34.3 percent of the year's U.S. recorded-music-industry revenue, growing 29 percent from the previous year and becoming the largest source of income, pulling in around $2.4 billion. US streaming revenue grew 57 percent to $1.6 billion in the first half of 2016 and accounted for almost half of industry sales. This contrasts with the $14.6 billion in revenue that was received in 1999 by the U.S. music industry from the sale of CDs.\nThe turmoil in the recorded-music industry in the 2000s altered the historically anomalous twentieth-century balance between artists, record companies, promoters, retail music-stores and consumers. , big-box stores such as Wal-Mart and Best Buy sell more records than music-only CD stores, which have ceased to function as a major player in the music industry. Music-performing artists now rely on live performance and merchandise sales (T-shirts, sweatshirts, etc.) for the majority of their income, which in turn has made them more dependent - like pre-20th-century musicians - on patrons, now exemplified by music promoters such as Live Nation (which dominates tour promotion and owns or manages a large number of music venues). In order to benefit from all of an artist's income streams, record companies increasingly rely on the \"360 deal\", a new business-relationship pioneered by Robbie Williams and EMI in 2007.\nAt the other extreme, record companies can offer a simple manufacturing- and distribution-deal, which gives a higher percentage to the artist, but does not cover the expenses of marketing and promotion.\nCompanies like Kickstarter help independent musicians produce their albums through fans funding bands they want to listen to. Many newer artists no longer see a record deal as an integral part of their business plan at all. Inexpensive recording-hardware and -software make it possible to record reasonable-quality music on a laptop in a bedroom and to distribute it over the Internet to a worldwide audience. This, in turn, has caused problems for recording studios, record producers and audio engineers: the \"Los Angeles Times\" reports that as many as half of the recording facilities in that city have failed.\nChanges in the music industry have given consumers access to a wider variety of music than ever before, at a price that gradually approaches zero. However, consumer spending on music-related software and hardware increased dramatically over the last decade, providing a valuable new income-stream for technology companies such as Apple Inc. and Pandora Radio.\n\nThe music industry is a complex system of many different organizations, firms and individuals. It has undergone dramatic changes in the first decades of the 21st century. However, the majority of the participants in the music industry still fulfill their traditional roles, which are described below. There are three types of property that are created and sold by the recording industry: compositions (songs, pieces, lyrics), recordings (audio and video) and media (such as CDs or MP3s, and DVDs). There may be many recordings of a single composition and a single recording will typically be distributed via many media. For example, the song \"My Way\" is owned by its composers, Paul Anka and Claude François, Frank Sinatra's recording of \"My Way\" is owned by Capitol Records, Sid Vicious's recording of \"My Way\" is owned by Virgin Records, and the millions of CDs and vinyl records that can play these recordings are owned by millions of individual consumers.\n\nSongs, instrumental pieces and other musical compositions are created by songwriters or composers and are originally owned by the composer, although they may be sold or the rights may be otherwise assigned. For example, in the case of work for hire, the composition is owned immediately by another party. Traditionally, the copyright owner licenses or \"assigns\" some of their rights to publishing companies, by means of a publishing contract. The publishing company (or a collection society operating on behalf of many such publishers, songwriters and composers) collects fees (known as \"publishing royalties\") when the composition is used. A portion of the royalties are paid by the publishing company to the copyright owner, depending on the terms of the contract. Sheet music provides an income stream that is paid exclusively to the composers and their publishing company. Typically (although not universally), the publishing company will provide the owner with an advance against future earnings when the publishing contract is signed. A publishing company will also promote the compositions, such as by acquiring song \"placements\" on television or in films.\n\nRecordings are created by recording artists, which includes singers, musicians (including session musicians) and musical ensembles (e.g., backing bands, rhythm sections, orchestras, etc.) usually with the assistance and guidance from record producers and audio engineers. They were traditionally made in recording studios (which are rented for a daily or hourly rate) in a recording session. In the 21st century, advances in digital recording technology have allowed many producers and artists to create \"home studios\" using high-end computers and digital recording programs like Pro Tools, bypassing the traditional role of the commercial recording studio. The record producer oversees all aspects of the recording, making many of the logistic, financial and artistic decisions in cooperation with the artists. The record producer has a range of different responsibilities including choosing material and/or working with the composers, hiring session musicians, helping to arrange the songs, overseeing the musician performances, and directing the audio engineer during recording and mixing to get the best sound. Audio engineers (including recording, mixing and mastering engineers) are responsible for ensuring good audio quality during the recording. They select and set up microphones and use effects units and mixing consoles to adjust the sound and level of the music. A recording session may also require the services of an arranger, orchestrator, studio musicians, session musicians, vocal coaches, or even a discreetly-hired ghostwriter to help with the lyrics or songwriting.\nRecordings are (traditionally) owned by record companies. Some artists own their own record companies (e.g., Ani DiFranco). A recording contract specifies the business relationship between a recording artist and the record company. In a traditional contract, the company provides an advance to the artist who agrees to record music that will be owned by the company. The A&R department of a record company is responsible for finding new talent and overseeing the recording process. The company pays for the recording costs and the cost of promoting and marketing the record. For physical media (such as CDs), the company also pays to manufacture and distribute the physical recordings. Smaller record companies (known as \"indies\") will form business relationships with other companies to handle many of these tasks. The record company pays the recording artist a portion of the income from the sale of the recordings, also known as a \"royalty\", but this is distinct from the publishing royalties described above. This portion is similar to a percentage, but may be limited or expanded by a number of factors (such as free goods, recoupable expenses, bonuses, etc.) that are specified by the record contract. Session musicians and orchestra members (as well as a few recording artists in special markets) are under contract to provide work for hire; they are typically only paid one-time fees or regular wages for their services, rather than ongoing royalties.\n\nPhysical media (such as CDs or vinyl records) are sold by music retailers and are owned by the consumers after they buy them. Buyers do not typically have the right to make digital copies from CDs or other media they buy, or rent or lease the CDs, because they do not own the recording on the CD, they only own the individual physical CD. A music distributor delivers crates of the packaged physical media from the manufacturer to the retailer and maintains commercial relationships with retailers and record companies. The music retailer pays the distributor, who in turn pays the record company for the recordings. The record company pays mechanical royalties to the publisher and composer via a collection society. The record company then pays royalties, if contractually obligated, to the recording artist. In the case of digital downloads or online streaming of music, there is no physical media other than the consumer's computer memory on his or her portable media player or laptop. For this reason, artists such as Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney, Kings of Leon, and others have called for legal changes that would deny social media the right to stream their music without paying them royalties. In the digital and online music market of the 2000s, the distributor becomes optional. Large online shops may pay the labels directly, but digital distributors do exist to provide distribution services for vendors large and small. When purchasing digital downloads or listening to music streaming, the consumer may be required to agree to record company and vendor licensing terms beyond those which are inherent in copyright; for example, some services may allow consumers to freely share the recording, but others may restrict the user to storing the music on a specific number of hard drives or devices.\n\nWhen a recording is broadcast (either on radio or by a background music service such as Muzak), performance rights organisations (such as the ASCAP and BMI in the US, SOCAN in Canada, or MCPS and PRS in the UK), collect a third type of royalty known as a performance royalty, which is paid to songwriters, composers and recording artists. This royalty is typically much smaller than publishing or mechanical royalties. Within the past decade, more than \"15 to 30 percent\" of tracks on streaming services are unidentified with a specific artist. Jeff Price says \"Audiam, an online music streaming service, has made over several hundred thousand dollars in the past year from collecting royalties from online streaming. According to Ken Levitan, manager from Kings of Leon, Cheap Trick and others, \"Youtube has become radio for kids\". Because of the overuse of YouTube and offline streaming, album sales have fallen by 60 percent in the past few years. When recordings are used in television and film, the composer and their publishing company are typically paid through a synchronization license. In the 2000s, online subscription services (such as Rhapsody) also provide an income stream directly to record companies, and through them, to artists, contracts permitting.\n\nA promoter brings together a performing artist and a venue owner and arranges contracts. A booking agency represents the artist to promoters, makes deals and books performances. Consumers usually buy tickets either from the venue or from a ticket distribution service such as Ticketmaster. In the US, Live Nation is the dominant company in all of these roles: they own most of the large venues in the US, they are the largest promoter, and they own Ticketmaster. Choices about where and when to tour are decided by the artist's management and the artist, sometimes in consultation with the record company. Record companies may finance a tour in the hopes that it will help promote the sale of recordings. However, in the 21st century, it has become more common to release recordings to promote ticket sales for live shows, rather than book tours to promote the sales of recordings.\n\nMajor, successful artists will usually employ a road crew: a semi-permanent touring organization that travels with the artist during concert series. The road crew is headed by a tour manager. Crew members provides stage lighting, live sound reinforcement, musical instrument tuning and maintenance, bodyguard for the artist and transportation of the equipment and music ensemble members. On large tours, the road crew may also include an accountant, stage manager, hairdressers, makeup artists and catering staff. Local crews are typically hired to help move equipment on and off stage. On a small tour with less financial backing, all of these jobs may be handled by just a few roadies or by the musicians themselves. Bands signed with small \"indie\" labels and bands in genres such as hardcore punk are more likely to do tours without a road crew, or with minimal support.\n\nArtists such as singers and musicians may hire a number of people from other fields to assist them with their career. The artist manager oversees all aspects of an artist's career in exchange for a percentage of the artist's income. An entertainment lawyer assists them with the details of their contracts with record companies and other deals. A business manager handles financial transactions, taxes and bookkeeping. Unions, such as AFTRA and the American Federation of Musicians in the U.S. provide health insurance and instrument insurance for musicians. A successful artist functions in the market as a brand and, as such, they may derive income from many other streams, such as merchandise, personal endorsements, appearances (without performing) at events or Internet-based services. These are typically overseen by the artist's manager and take the form of relationships between the artist and companies that specialize in these products. Singers may also hire a vocal coach, dance instructor, acting coach, personal trainer or life coach to help them.\n\nIn the 2000s, traditional lines that once divided singers, instrumentalists, publishers, record companies, distributors, retail and consumer electronics have become blurred or erased. Artists may record in a home studio using a high-end laptop and a digital recording program such as Pro Tools or use Kickstarter to raise money for an expensive studio recording session without involving a record company. Artists may choose to exclusively promote and market themselves using only free online video sharing services such as YouTube or using social media websites, bypassing traditional promotion and marketing by a record company. In the 2000s, consumer electronics and computer companies such as Apple Computer have become digital music retailers. New digital music distribution technologies and the trends towards using sampling of older songs in new songs or blending different songs to create \"mashup\" recordings have also forced both governments and the music industry to re-examine the definitions of intellectual property and the rights of all the parties involved. Also compounding the issue of defining copyright boundaries is the fact that the definition of \"royalty\" and \"copyright\" varies from country to country and region to region, which changes the terms of some of these business relationships.\n\nAfter 15 or so years of the Internet economy, the digital music industry platforms like iTunes, Spotify, and Google Play are major improvements over the early illegal file sharing days. However, the multitude of service offerings and revenue models make it difficult to understand the true value of each and what they can deliver for musicians and music companies. As well, there are major transparency problems throughout the music industry caused by outdated technology. With the emerging of new business models as streaming platforms, and online music services, a large amount of data is processed. Access to big data may increase transparency in the industry.\n\nAccording to IFPI, the global digital album sales grew by 6.9% in 2014.\nSource: Nielsen SoundScan, Official Charts Company/BPI, GfK and IFPI estimate.\n\nPrior to December 1998, the industry was dominated by the \"Big Six\": Sony Music and BMG had not yet merged, and PolyGram had not yet been absorbed into Universal Music Group. After the PolyGram-Universal merger, the 1998 market shares reflected a \"Big Five\", commanding 77.4% of the market, as follows, according to MEI World Report 2000:\n\nIn 2004, the joint venture of Sony and BMG created the 'Big Four' at a time the global market was estimated at $30–40 billion. Total annual unit sales (CDs, music videos, MP3s) in 2004 were 3 billion. Additionally, according to an IFPI report published in August 2005, the big four accounted for 71.7% of retail music sales:\n\nNielsen SoundScan in their 2011 report noted that the \"big four\" controlled about 88% of the market:\n\nAfter the absorption of EMI by Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group in December 2011 the \"big three\" were created and on January 8, 2013 after the merger there were layoffs of forty workers from EMI. European regulators forced Universal Music to spin off EMI assets which became the Parlophone Label Group which was acquired by Warner Music Group. Nielsen SoundScan issued a report in 2012, noting that these labels controlled 88.5% of the market, and further noted:\n\nNote: the IFPI and Nielsen Soundscan use different methodologies, which makes their figures difficult to compare casually, and impossible to compare scientifically.\n\nCurrent Markets shares as of September 2018 are as follows:\n\nThe largest players in this industry own more than 100 subsidiary record labels or sublabels, each specializing in a certain market niche. Only the industry's most popular artists are signed directly to the major label. These companies account for more than half of US market share. However, this has fallen somewhat in recent years, as the new digital environment allows smaller labels to compete more effectively.\n\nTotal album sales have declined in the early decades of the 21st century, leading some music critics to declare the death of the album. (For instance, the only albums that went platinum in the US in 2014 were the soundtrack to the Disney animated film \"Frozen\" and Taylor Swift's \"1989\", whereas several artists did in 2013.) The following table shows album sales and market value in the world in 2014.\n\nSource: IFPI 2014 annual report.\n\nIn its June 30, 2000 annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Seagram reported that Universal Music Group made 40% of the worldwide classical music sales over the preceding year.\n\nInterim physical retail sales in 2005. All figures in millions.\n\nApproximately 21% of the gross CD revenue numbers in 2003 can be attributed to used CD sales. This number grew to approximately 27% in 2007. The growth is attributed to increasing on-line sales of used product by outlets such as Amazon.com, the growth of used music media is expected to continue to grow as the cost of digital downloads continues to rise. The sale of used goods financially benefits the vendors and online marketplaces, but in the United States, the first-sale doctrine prevents copyright owners (record labels and publishers, generally) from \"double dipping\" through a levy on the sale of used music.\n\nIn mid-2011, the RIAA trumpeted a sales increase of 5% over 2010, stating that \"there's probably no one single reason\" for the bump.\n\nThe Nielsen Company & Billboard's 2012 Industry Report shows overall music sales increased 3.1% over 2011. Digital sales caused this increase, with a Digital Album sales growth of 14.1% and Digital Track sales growth of 5.1%, whereas Physical Music sales decreased by 12.8% versus 2011. Despite the decrease, physical albums were still the dominant album format. Vinyl Record sales increased by 17.7% and Holiday Season Album sales decreased by 7.1%.\n\nGlobal trade revenue according to the IFPI.\n\n\nThe List of music associations and organizations covers examples from around the world, ranging from huge international bodies to smaller national-level bodies.\n\n\n\n"}

The two-dimensional painted steel sculptures were designed at different scales (from approximately 12 feet to 49 feet high), were painted black, and depict a man with a motorized arm and hammer movement to symbolize workers throughout the world. They were structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates (LERA).\n\nAccording to Public Art in Public Places, the aging kinetic feature of the sculpture's hammering arm has been known to fail due to poor maintenance of the electrical motor component, thereby compromising the sculpture's intended effect and integrity.\n\nModels of various sizes in the series have been installed in public spaces and museums throughout the United States and Europe, with the first 3.4 m (11.5 ft) high wood model shown at the Paula Cooper Gallery. The largest model reaches approximately 21 metres (69 ft), mid-size models at approximately 15 m (49 ft) and at 7 m (23 ft).\n\nThe largest \"Hammering Man\" is in Seoul, South Korea () next to the Heungkuk Life Insurance building in the Gwanghwamun area of the city. Installed in 2002, it stands 22 m (72 ft) high and weighs 50 tons. Seoul's \"Hammering Man\" strikes a blow every minute and seventeen seconds and is considered an important city landmark. In August 2009, the city of Seoul completed a project to move the sculpture 4.8 m/16 ft closer to the sidewalk and dedicated a new small gallery park at the site. A spiral path surrounding the statue was created to enhance its presence. Specially designed benches, landscaping, and lighting were also added to the surrounding park.\n\nThe \"Hammering Man\" sculpture in Frankfurt, Germany is 21 metres (68.9 ft) tall and was commissioned in 1990, for the new Messeturm (exhibition tower) building at the Frankfurt Trade Fair. (). An unofficial 6 ft tall copy of the \"Hammering Man\" appeared in Frankfurth in the 1990s in the \"Hülya-Platz\" (in the district Bockenheim, ). It was donated by a citizen's group against neo-nazism to commemorate the Solingen arson attack of 1993, and its hammer was designed with a hand crank that demolished a swastika emblem. This stealth sculpture was often vandalized and in April 2007 it was removed and scrapped after becoming so badly damaged and corroded that it was considered a danger for public safety. It was later replaced by a successor.\n\nThe \"Hammering Man\" sculpture in Seattle is 14.6 m (48 feet) tall, 76 cm (30 inches) wide and 18 cm (7 inches) deep, and weighs 26,000 pounds. It is located directly in front of the Seattle Art Museum () and made out of hollow-fabricated steel with a mechanized arm of aluminum, an electric motor and flat black automotive paint. It was built in 1991 at a cost of $450,000. Original funding was provided by the Virginia Wright Fund in honor of Prentice Bloedel; City of Seattle 1% for Art funds; the Museum Development Authority and PONCHO (Patrons of Northwest Civic, Cultural and Charitable Organizations). However, during installation on September 28, 1991, the first sculpture fell and had to be replaced. The replaced sculpture was fabricated by Lippincott, Inc., North Haven, Connecticut and installed by Fabrication Specialities, Seattle. Its arm \"hammers\" silently and smoothly four times per minute, 20 hours a day, and runs on a 3-hp electric motor set on an automatic timer. The \"Hammering Man\" sculpture's arm rests 1–5 a.m. each morning as well as every year on Labor Day. On Labor Day 1993, a group of local artists led by Jason Sprinkle attached a scaled-to-fit ball and chain to the sculpture's leg.\n\nBorofsky's statement on the Seattle installation: \"The \"Hammering Man\" is a worker. The \"Hammering Man\" celebrates the worker. He or she is the village craftsman, the South African coal miner, the computer operator, the farmer or the aerospace worker-the people who produce the commodities on which we depend. This \"Hammering Man\" is 48 feet tall. It is constructed of steel (hollow-fabricated) and weighs over 20,000 pounds. A structural steel base-plate is bolted to a cement-block footing below ground level so that the architect's chosen material for the plaza can be brought up to flush to the feet of the sculpture. The \"Hammering Man\" appears to be standing (and working) on the plaza without a base in between. The black silhouette of the figure is, in fact, 30 inches wide: body (10 inches), arm (10 inches), space between arm and body (10 inches), as well as an extra 16 inches width at the top for the motor. The motorized hammering arm will move smoothly and meditatively up and down at a rate of four times per minute. Electricity runs from the motor down inside the sculpture and under the plaza to an on-off switch location. The \"Hammering Man\" is set on a timer and rests during evening and early morning hours. The sculpture has been sited so that the many pedestrians and drivers moving up and down First Avenue can enjoy the animated form while contemplating the meaning of the \"Hammering Man\" in their own lives.\"\n\n\"This sculpture is the second largest \"Hammering Man\" on the planet. A taller version is in Frankfurt, Germany. My goal is to have several different \"Hammering Men\" placed around the world-all working simultaneously. Other big outdoor versions of this work are in Japan and Switzerland. In the U.S. there are \"Hammering Men\" sculptures in New York, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., among other places. It's a concept which helps to connect all of us together and also gives each specific \"Hammering Man\" site the potential for its own personal interpretations. The State of Washington is known for its aerospace, electronics, timber, fishing, agriculture, and gold mining industries-people working with their hands, or manual labor. Let this sculpture be a symbol for all the people of Seattle working with others on the planet to create a happier and more enlightened humanity.\"\n\n\"I want this work to communicate to all the people of Seattle-not just the artists, but families, young and old. I would hope that children who see the \"Hammering Man\" at work would connect their delight with the potential mysteries that a museum could offer them in their future. At its heart, society reveres the worker. The \"Hammering Man\" is the worker in all of us. Jonathan Borofsky (Spring 2002)\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1946213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946213", "title": "Scholomance", "text": "Scholomance\n\nThe Scholomance ( , Solomonărie ) was a fabled school of black magic in Transylvania, which was run by the Devil, according to folkloric accounts. The school enrolled about ten students to become the \"Solomonari\". Courses taught included the speech of animals and magic spells. One of the graduates was chosen by the Devil to be the Weathermaker and tasked with riding a dragon to control the weather.\n\nThe school lay underground, and the students remained unexposed to sunlight for the seven-year duration of their study. The dragon (\"zmeu\" or \"balaur\") was kept submerged in a mountaintop lake, south of Hermannstadt (now called Sibiu by its Romanian name), according to some accounts.\n\nAn early source on the Scholomance and Dracula folklore was the article \"Transylvanian Superstitions\" (1885), written by Scottish expatriate Emily Gerard. It has been established for certain this article was an important source that Bram Stoker consulted for his novel, \"Dracula\". Gerard also published similar material in \"Land Beyond the Forest\" (1888), which Stoker might have also read, and other commentators stated this was Bram Stoker's direct source for Scholomance in his novel.\n\nTwenty years earlier, a description of the Scholomance and its pupils (the \"Scholomonariu\") was given in an article written by Wilhelm Schmidt (1817–1901), a German schoolteacher at the Romanian town of Hermannstadt.\n\nThe school, it was believed, recruited a handful of pupils from the local population. Enrollment could be seven, ten, or thirteen pupils. Here they learned the language of all living things, the secrets of nature, and magic. Some sources add specifically the pupils were instructed on how to cast magic spells, ride flying dragons, and control the rain.\n\nThe duration of their study was seven or nine years, and the final assignment for graduation required the copying of one's entire knowledge of humanity into a \"Solomonar's book\".\n\nThere was also the belief that the Devil instructed at the Scholomance. Moses Gaster remarked that this association with the Devil indicates that the memory of the school's origins as having to do with King Solomon had completely faded.\n\nThe Scholomance, according to Gerard, was at some unspecified location deep in the mountains, but the dragon (correctly spelled \"zmeu\", though given phonetically in German as \"ismeju\".) was stabled underwater in a small mountaintop lake south of Hermannstadt in central Romania (modern Sibiu, Romania, called Nagyszeben in Hungarian). Stoker's novel locates the Scholomance near a non-existent \"Lake Hermannstadt\".\n\nThe , as it was called by the Romanians, was situated underground, according to Romaninan folklorist Simion Florea Marian. Students there shunned sunlight for the seven-year duration of their training.\n\nBy some accounts, one of the ten graduating students would be chosen by the Devil to be the Weathermaker () and to ride a dragon (\"zmeu\" in Romanian) in this errand; every time the dragon glanced at the clouds, rainfall would come. But according to legend, God made sure the dragon would not weary, because if it plummeted, it would devour a great part of the earth. The Solomonari's dragon-mount was, however, a \"balaur\" according to folklorist Marian's account.\n\n\"Scholomance\" is a Germanization, Solomonărie was the Romanian form according to the popular beliefs collected by Marian, and an alternate Şolomanţâ is given elsewhere.\n\nThese forms suggest a tie to King Solomon, and it has been pointed out that one account in folklore describes the Solomonari as disciples of the weather-controlling ways of Solomon. Additionally, some assimilation might have occurred with Salamanca, Spain, the famed city of learning, with medieval stories of a sorcery taught by the devil located in the \"\".\n\n\"Scholomance\" has been suspected of not being a genuine Romanian term, but rather a misnomer, created through the corrupted Germanization of \"Solomonari\", the term for the students and not the school. Such a view was given by Elizabeth Miller, a scholar specializing in Dracula studies.\n\nA mistaken idea that \"Scholomance\" was a neologism first reported in 1885 by Emily Gerard was at one time current in English-speaking circles. The terms \"Scholomance\" and \"Scholomonariu\" appear in the Austrian journal \"Österreichische Revue\" in 1865.\n\nSome modern commentators have referred to the school as \"L'École du Dragon\" or \"The School of the Dragon\".\n\nBram Stoker, who studied Gerard's work extensively, refers to it twice in \"Dracula\", once in chapter 18:\n\nThe Draculas were, says Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due.\n\nAnd in chapter 23:\n\nHe dared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay.\n\nStoker's reference to \"Lake Hermanstadt\" appears to be a misinterpretation of Gerard's passage, as there is no body of water by that name. The part of the Carpathians near Hermannstadt holds Păltiniş Lake and Bâlea Lake, which host popular resorts for people of the surrounding area.\n\nIn the fantasy novel \"Lord of Middle Air\" by Michael Scott Rohan, the character of wizard Michael Scot reveals that he dared to train at the Scholomance on two occasions, as there was so much knowledge it could not all be learnt in one night.\n\nThe novel \"Anno Dracula\" by Kim Newman cites the same quotation from Stoker's \"Dracula\" in chapter 23.\n\nThe YA novel \"Lady Midnight\" by Cassandra Clare uses the Scholomance as a Shadowhunter training academy to train elite Shadowhunters in her spinoff to \"The Mortal Instruments\", \"The Dark Artifices\".\n\nThe name has been reused in the computer game industry to refer to other schools of dark magic:\n\nThe warlocks in Bungie's \"\" are described as having been trained at a school of magic named the Scholomance.\n\nIn Blizzard Entertainment's \"World of Warcraft\", the Scholomance is a ruined castle held by undead forces whose cellars and crypts are now used to train necromancers and create undead monsters. Like its legendary namesake, the Scholomance in World of Warcraft is in the middle of a lake.\n\n\n"}

Though on 3 May 2006 it was confirmed by the Appeal Commission of the FA that the club would be relegated. It thus seized the Evocation Commission. The Executive Committee of the FA decided on 8 May 2006 to let Geel play the 2005–06 second division final round although the rules of the competition state that a relegated club cannot take part in the final round. On 15 June 2006 the Evocation Commission rejected the plaint of Geel and the club was then officially relegated to the third division, permitting K.M. S.K.

Eventually they chose to take over Lierse and KFC Turnhout. On 30 June 2008, the club filed for bankruptcy and ultimately ceased to exist.\n\nA different local team Verbroedering Meerhout, playing in Belgian Promotion, chose to move to the stadium of Verbroedering Geel due to better facilities.

The range is a long series of mountains in central Australia, consisting of parallel ridges running to the east and west of Alice Springs. The mountain range contains many spectacular gaps and gorges as well as areas of Aboriginal significance.\n\nThe ranges were named after Sir Richard MacDonnell (the Governor of South Australia at the time) by John McDouall Stuart, whose 1860 expedition reached them in April of that year. The Horn Expedition investigated the ranges as part of the scientific expedition into central Australia. Other explorers of the range included David Lindsay and John Ross.\n\nThe MacDonnell Ranges were often depicted in the paintings of Albert Namatjira.\n\nThe highest peaks are Mount Zeil with an elevation of AHD, Mount Liebig at AHD, Mount Edward at , Mount Giles at and Mount Sonder at AHD; the five highest mountains in the Northern Territory. The headwaters of the Todd, Finke and Sandover rivers form in the MacDonnell Ranges. The range is crossed by the Australian Overland Telegraph Line and the Stuart Highway.\n\n300-350 million years ago a mountain building event created the MacDonnell Ranges. Since that time, folding, faulting and erosion have shaped the range and created numerous gaps and gorges. The ranges are composed of many rock types, but are most famous for their red quartzite peaks and gorges. Other rock types include granite, limestone, sandstone and siltstone. Some of the valleys of the range contain fossil evidence of the inland sea that once covered central Australia.\n\nPart of the Central Ranges xeric scrub ecoregion of dry scrubby grassland, the ranges are home to a large number of endemic species that includes the centralian tree frog \"Litoria gilleni\". This is mostly due to the micro climates that are found around the cold rock pools.\n\nThe West MacDonnell National Park was established in 1984 to protect the numerous parks and reserves of the range, including internal residents inside the range. It also facilitated the development of the Larapinta Trail.\n\nTo the east of Alice Springs, within an hour's drive, are sites important to the local Arrernte people, many of which contain examples of Aboriginal rock art. These include Emily Gap, Jessie Gap, Trephina Gorge and N’Dhala Gorge.\n\nTo the west of Alice Springs is the Larapinta Trail—a world-class, long distance bush walking trail that runs along the backbone of the range.

It is officially composed by six channels: \"TV3\", \"TV3 HD\", \"33\"/\"Super3\", \"3/24\", \"Esport 3\" and \"TV3CAT\".\n\nWhile the main language of all these channels is Catalan, Spanish is usually neither sub-titled nor dubbed, as it is generally accepted that all Catalan speakers are by default also Spanish speakers. Some programmes such as Polònia and APM use Spanish extensively, largely for effect. In the Aran Valley, there are programs in Aranese.\n\nTVC headquarters are located in Sant Joan Despí, near Barcelona.\n\nTV3 started its trial broadcasts on 11 September 1983 (the National Day of Catalonia) but its regular broadcasts started a few months later, on 16 January 1984. TV3 was the first television channel to broadcast only in Catalan. In 1985, TV3 expanded its coverage to Andorra, Northern Catalonia and the Valencian Community. One year later, TV3 inaugurated its new headquarters, a 4.5-hectare facility in Sant Joan Despí, near Barcelona.\n\nSince 1987, TV3 has broadcast a second audio channel on almost all foreign-language series and movies with the original programme audio, first using the Zweikanalton system and currently using NICAM. Local series and movies are usually broadcast in NICAM stereo, although sometimes an audio narration track for blind and visually impaired viewers is provided as well.\n\nIn 1988, TV3 started a decentralisation process, first broadcasting programmes in the Aranese language for the Aran Valley and, one year later, opening branch offices in Tarragona, Girona and Lleida and creating the \"Telenoticies Comarques\", a regional news programme broadcast simultaneously in four different editions, one for each of the four Catalan provinces.\n\nDuring the 1992 Summer Olympics, TV3 and TVE created the Olympic Channel, a joint network to provide coverage for the Olympic Games using Canal 33's frequency.\n\nIn 2002, Televisió de Catalunya started broadcasting in the Digital terrestrial television system. It has quickly embraced technologies like the internet and mobile phones, as well as internal technological innovations.\n\nTelevisió de Catalunya's terrestrial channels are available in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands thanks to an agreement between the Generalitat de Catalunya and the Balearic Islands government. Unofficially, it can also be received in the Valencian Community (now forbidden since December 2010), Andorra, Northern Catalonia and La Franja.\n\nTV3CAT is broadcast via satellites Astra (in Europe) and Hispasat (in Europe and the Americas). The TVCi signal is also carried by satellite platform and cable operators: Ono, Movistar TV, Euskaltel, Digital+, Freebox, DigiTV, Kabel BW, Evrotur, Sofiacable and Cable Mágico.\n\nTV3CAT is also available worldwide via its online TV service \"3alacarta\".\n\nTV3 is TVC's first and main channel. A generalist channel, it broadcasts news and entertainment programmes, as well as fiction series and movies, and important sports events, including La Liga football matches.\n\n3/24 is TVC's 24-hour news channel, launched in 2003.\n\nSuper3 is a children's and teenagers' channel, that broadcasts from 6:00 to 21:30. It broadcasts both entertainment and educational programmes, for a wide range of ages. Early morning programmes are usually directed to younger children, while the afternoon is directed more towards teenagers. It started on 18 October 2009, replacing K3.\n\nInitially, it broadcast from 7:00 to 21:30 and the rest of the day was broadcasting Canal 300. In September 2010, 300 was replaced by 3XL and Super3 changed its broadcasting hours (from 6:00 to 21:30).\n\nTVC's second channel, 33 is a cultural channel. Its programming consists of cultural programmes, documentaries and debates. Until 2011 and the creation of the sport channel Esport 3, it also broadcast sport events and programmes.\n\nOriginally called just Canal 33, in 2003 it underwent a restructuring that split it into two channels that shared the same frequency: 33 and K3.\nWhile this is still true for analogical broadcasting, since December 2006, 33 has a channel of its own in digital terrestrial television.\n\nEsport 3 is TVC's sports channel. It started its emission tests in October 2010 and started its regular emissions in early 2011. It broadcasts sports events (except the most important ones and La Liga football matches, that are broadcast by the main channel TV3) and sports programmes (Temps d'aventura).\n\nTV3CAT (known as TVCi until June 2009) is TVC's satellite channel, launched in 1995. It broadcasts a selection of TV3 and 33 programmes, as well as fiction series and movies.\n\nTV3 HD is an experimental high-definition digital terrestrial channel launched in 2007 using the H.264 standard.\n"}

The molar mass distribution (or molecular weight distribution) describes the relationship between the number of moles of each polymer species (N) and the molar mass (M) of that species. The molar mass distribution of a polymer may be modified by polymer fractionation.\n\nDifferent average values can be defined, depending on the statistical method applied. In practice four averages are used, representing the weighted mean taken with the mole fraction, the weight fraction, and two other functions which can be related to measured quantities:\n\n\nformula_1\nHere formula_2 is the exponent in the Mark–Houwink equation that relates the intrinsic viscosity to molar mass.\n\nThese different definitions have true physical meaning because different techniques in physical polymer chemistry often measure just one of them. For instance, osmometry measures number average molar mass and small-angle laser light scattering measures mass average molar mass. M is obtained from viscosimetry and M by sedimentation in an analytical ultra-centrifuge. The quantity a in the expression for the viscosity average molar mass varies from 0.5 to 0.8 and depends on the interaction between solvent and polymer in a dilute solution. In a typical distribution curve, the average values are related to each other as follows: M < M < M < M. The dispersity (also known as the \"polydispersity index\") of a sample is defined as M divided by M and gives an indication just how narrow a distribution is.\n\nThe most common technique for measuring molecular mass used in modern times is a variant of high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) known by the interchangeable terms of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). These techniques involve forcing a polymer solution through a matrix of cross-linked polymer particles at a pressure of up to several hundred bar. The limited accessibility of stationary phase pore volume for the polymer molecules results in shorter elution times for high-molecular-mass species. The use of low dispersity standards allows the user to correlate retention time with molecular mass, although the actual correlation is with the Hydrodynamic volume. If the relationship between molar mass and the hydrodynamic volume changes (i.e., the polymer is not exactly the same shape as the standard) then the calibration for mass is in error.\n\nThe most common detectors used for size exclusion chromatography include online methods similar to the bench methods used above. By far the most common is the differential refractive index detector that measures the change in refractive index of the solvent. This detector is concentration-sensitive and very molecular-mass-insensitive, so it is ideal for a single-detector GPC system, as it allows the generation of mass v's molecular mass curves. Less common but more accurate and reliable is a molecular-mass-sensitive detector using multi-angle laser-light scattering - see Static Light Scattering. These detectors directly measure the molecular mass of the polymer and are most often used in conjunction with differential refractive index detectors. A further alternative is either low-angle light scattering, which uses a single low angle to determine the molar mass, or Right-Angle-Light Laser scattering in combination with a viscometer, although this latter technique does not give an absolute measure of molar mass but one relative to the structural model used.\n\nThe molar mass distribution of a polymer sample depends on factors such as chemical kinetics and work-up procedure. Ideal step-growth polymerization gives a polymer with dispersity of 2. Ideal living polymerization results in a dispersity of 1. By dissolving a polymer an insoluble high molar mass fraction may be filtered off resulting in a large reduction in M and a small reduction in M thus reducing dispersity.\n\nThe number average molar mass is a way of determining the molecular mass of a polymer. Polymer molecules, even ones of the same type, come in different sizes (chain lengths, for linear polymers), so the average molecular mass will depend on the method of averaging. The \"number average\" molecular mass is the ordinary arithmetic mean or average of the molecular masses of the individual macromolecules. It is determined by measuring the molecular mass of \"n\" polymer molecules, summing the masses, and dividing by \"n\".\n\nformula_3\n\nThe number average molecular mass of a polymer can be determined by gel permeation chromatography, viscometry via the (Mark–Houwink equation), colligative methods such as vapor pressure osmometry, end-group determination or proton NMR.\n\n\"High Number-Average Molecular Mass Polymers\" may be obtained only with a high fractional monomer conversion in the case of step-growth polymerization, as per the Carothers' equation.\n\nThe mass average molar mass (often loosely termed \"weight average molar mass\") is another way of describing the molar mass of a polymer. Some properties are dependent on molecular size, so a larger molecule will have a larger contribution than a smaller molecule. The mass average molar mass is calculated by\n\nformula_4\n\nwhere formula_5 is the number of molecules of molecular mass formula_6.\n\nThe mass average molecular mass can be determined by static light scattering, small angle neutron scattering, X-ray scattering, and sedimentation velocity.\n\nThe ratio of the \"mass average\" to the \"number average\" is called the dispersity or the \"polydispersity\" index.\n\nThe \"mass-average molecular mass\", \"M\", is also related to the \"fractional monomer conversion\", \"p\", in step-growth polymerization as per Carothers' equation:\n\nThe z-average molar mass is the third moment or third power average molar mass, which is calculated by\n\nformula_8\n\nThe z-average molar mass can be determined with ultracentrifugation. The melt elasticity of a polymer is dependent on M.\n\n"}

The original goal of the HyperWRT project was to add a set of features—such as power boost—to the latest Linux-based Linksys firmware, extending its possibilities but staying close to the official firmware. Over time, it continued to be updated with newer Linksys firmware, and added many more features typically found in enterprise routing equipment. HyperWRT is no longer maintained and has been succeeded by Tomato.\n\nThe original HyperWRT project was started in 2004 by Timothy Jans (a.k.a. Avenger 2.0), with continued development into early 2005. Another programmer called Rupan then continued HyperWRT development by integrating newer Linksys code as it was released.\n\nLater in 2005, two developers called tofu and Thibor picked up HyperWRT development with \"HyperWRT +tofu\" for the WRT54G and \"HyperWRT Thibor\" for the WRT54GS. Both developers frequently collaborated and added features from each other's releases, and both developed WRTSL54GS versions of their firmware. After February 2006, tofu discontinued development and his code was incorporated into HyperWRT Thibor. HyperWRT Thibor15c (July 2006) was the last version of HyperWRT and was compatible with the WRT54G (v1-v4), WRT54GL (v1-v1.1), WRT54GS (v1-v4), and WRTSL54GS (later unfinished beta 17rc3 released Feb 2008).\n\n\n"}

He began to attract attention outside of Canada with 1999's \"Hollow\". Around this time, some of Beck's songs made appearances in prime-time TV shows like \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"Queer as Folk\", and \"Felicity\". Picked up by the independent record label Easy!Tiger, \"Hollow\" was released in Europe nearly two years after its Canadian release, and regular international tours followed. More recently, his music has appeared in episodes of \"One Tree Hill\" and \"Degrassi\".\n\nBeck regularly trades guest appearances, in recording sessions and onstage, with other Canadian artists such as Sarah Harmer, Hayden, Leslie Feist, Jason Collett and British singer-songwriter Ed Harcourt. Beck is also an accomplished drummer, and briefly played drums for Bourbon Tabernacle Choir in the mid-nineties. He has also appeared as a multi-instrumentalist on many albums by Hayden, Sarah Harmer, Gonzales and others.\n\nAfter a long break from the music industry, partly triggered by September 11, Beck finally released his third, self-titled album in Canada in 2004.

{"id": "1946310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946310", "title": "Royal Lodge", "text": "Royal Lodge\n\nThe Royal Lodge is a Grade II listed house in Windsor Great Park in Berkshire, England, half a mile north of Cumberland Lodge and south of Windsor Castle. It was the Windsor residence of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother from 1952 until her death in 2002. Since 2004, it has been the official country residence of Prince Andrew, Duke of York and ex wife, Sarah, Duchess of York\n\nThe Lodge dates originally from the mid-seventeenth century, there being a house on the site by 1662. By 1750, the small Queen Anne style brick house was being used in conjunction with the adjacent dairy. By this time, it was known variously as the Lower Lodge, to distinguish it from Cumberland Lodge, then known as the Great Lodge, or the Dairy Lodge.\n\nFrom the mid-eighteenth century, it was home to the military topographer and artist Thomas Sandby (brother of the better known Paul), as Deputy Ranger of the Great Park. The house was then known as the Deputy Ranger's House.\n\nIt was enlarged by 1792 and was the home of Joseph Frost, the Park Bailiff, and then of the General Superintendent of Farms, after Sandby's death.\n\nGeorge, Prince of Wales (later King George IV), planned to rebuild Cumberland Lodge, after he had become Prince Regent. He used the Lower Lodge as temporary accommodation in 1812. Alterations and additions were undertaken by John Nash for the Prince of Wales.\n\nThe chapels of the Royal and Cumberland Lodges proved too small for the royal households in the early 19th century, and the Royal Chapel of All Saints was built in 1825 by Jeffry Wyatville. The chapel is less than a hundred yards from Royal Lodge.\nIt was now a large and elaborate cottage in the contemporary style of the cottage orné, with thatched roofs, verandas, and a conservatory. It became known as the Prince Regent's Cottage after the prince moved into it in 1815. The renovation of Cumberland Lodge was abandoned.\n\nAdditions were made after 1820. In 1823, Jeffry Wyatt (later Sir Jeffry Wyatville) succeeded Nash as architect, and the house (known now as the \"King's Cottage\") became known as the Royal Lodge in the late 1820s.\n\nAfter 1830, King William IV ordered the demolition of all of the house, except the conservatory. It became a residence again in 1840, and was used as accommodation for various officers of the Royal Household until 1843, and from 1873 to 1931.\n\nThe grounds extend to 98 acres (40 hectares), partly under its own head gardener, but mostly the responsibility of the Crown Estates Commissioners. While the house has grown piecemeal since the 1840s, and remains relatively small and informal, the grounds have a unifying plan. This was the result of work undertaken by the Duke and Duchess of York in the 1930s, with the assistance of Sir Eric Savill, of the Windsor Estate.\n\nIn 1931, King George V granted Royal Lodge to the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth) as a country retreat. Wings were added on each flank in the 1930s. There are two lodges at the entrance, and groups of three cottages each side of the lodges. The main building has some 30 rooms, including 7 bedrooms, and a saloon (48' by 30' by 30'). The original conservatory survives. The grounds contain the miniature cottage Y Bwthyn Bach, a gift to Princess Elizabeth as a child from the people of Wales in 1932.\n\nAfter the death of George VI in 1952, The Queen Mother continued to use the house as one of her country retreats as a grace and favour residence, until her death. The Queen Mother died at the Royal Lodge in March 2002, with her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, by her side.\n\nIn August 2003, The Duke of York was granted a lease agreement by the Crown Estate for 75 years. The property leased included the Royal Lodge, a Gardener's Cottage, the Chapel Lodge, six Lodge Cottages, and Police security accommodation in addition to 40 hectares of land. The lease agreement required Prince Andrew to carry out, at his own expense, extensive refurbishing work estimated at £7.5 million at September 2002 prices, excluding VAT (this sum was in fact exceeded). It also provided for a premium payment of £1 million. The National Audit Office (NAO) report into the lease agreement states that the Crown Estate's independent advisors had advised that the refurbishment work would cost at least £5 million and that the Prince should be given the option to buy out the notional annual rental payment (set at £260,000) for £2.5 million. Once the Prince committed to spending £7.5 million on refurbishment, it was decided that no rental would be required as he would be treated as having effectively bought out the notional annual rental payment because he exceeded the minimum £5 million required for refurbishment. As a result, only the £1 million premium was paid to the Crown Estate. There is no provision for any further rent review over the life of the 75-year lease agreement (unlike the rent reviews provided in the case of Bagshot Park, residence of Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, also leased from the Crown Estate).\n\nThe lease agreement provides that the prince may not benefit financially from any increase in the value of the property as the freehold belongs to the Crown Estate. The leasehold may be assigned only to his widow or his two daughters, Princess Beatrice of York and Princess Eugenie of York (or a trust established solely for their benefit). This may be a significant benefit given the increase in the value of the property and the notional annual rental payment which it would command over the course of the 75-year lease. The NAO Report does not specify whether sub-leasing by the prince or his daughters is allowed under the rental agreement. If the prince terminates the lease, the property would revert to the Crown Estate. He would be entitled to compensation for the refurbishment costs incurred up to a maximum of just under £7 million, which is reduced annually over the first 25 years, after which no compensation is payable.\n\nThe NAO report states that having already taken advice from one independent advisor on the transaction, the Crown Estate appointed a second firm of independent advisors to assess the details of the lease deal, given its importance. The second independent advisor concluded that the deal was appropriate having regard to the need to maintain management control over Royal Lodge and because of the security implications (particularly concerning the Royal Family's access to the Royal Chapel). In the circumstances, the Crown Estate considered that the requirement to obtain value for money was satisfied, taking into account the non-financial considerations relating to the lease of the property. The alternative use, to lease it on the commercial market, was therefore not possible. \nFollowing extensive renovations, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, with his two daughters, moved into the house in 2004, having vacated Sunninghill Park. In 2008, Sarah, Duchess of York, joined the Duke and their daughters in the home.\n"}
{"id": "1946320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946320", "title": "Paul Foster Case", "text": "Paul Foster Case\n\nPaul Foster Case (October 3, 1884 – March 2, 1954) was an American occultist of the early 20th century and author of numerous books on occult tarot and Qabalah. Perhaps his greatest contributions to the field of occultism were the lessons he wrote for associate members of Builders of the Adytum or B.O.T.A. The knowledge lectures given to initiated members of the chapters of the B.O.T.A. were equally profound, although the limited distribution has made them less well known.\n\nA modern scholar of the occult tarot and Qabalah, Paul Foster Case was born at 5:28 p.m., October 3, 1884 in Fairport, New York.\n\nHis father was the town librarian and a deacon at the local Congregational church. When he was five years old, his mother began teaching him to play the piano and organ, and later in his youth, Case performed as organist in his family's church. A talented musician, he embarked on a successful career as a violinist, and orchestra conductor. He had an honorary doctorate in music awarded to him.\n\nCase was early on attracted to the occult. While still a child he reported experiences that today are called lucid dreaming. He corresponded about these experiences with Rudyard Kipling who encouraged him as to the validity of his paranormal pursuits.\n\nIn the year 1900, Case met the occultist Claude Bragdon while both were performing at a charity performance. Bragdon asked Case what he thought the origin of playing cards was. After pursuing the question in his father's library, Case discovered a link to tarot, called 'The Game of Man'. Thus began what would become Case's lifelong study of the tarot, and leading to the creation of the B.O.T.A. tarot deck, which Case called a \"corrected\" version of the Rider-Waite cards.\n\nBetween 1905 and 1908 (aged 20–24), Case began practicing yoga, and in particular pranayama, from what published sources were available. His early experiences appear to have caused him some mental and emotional difficulties and left him with a lifelong concern that so called \"occult\" practice be done with proper guidance and training.\n\nIn the summer of 1907, Case read \"The Secret of Mental Magic\", by William W. Atkinson (aka Ramacharaka) which led him to correspond with the then popular new thought author. Many people have speculated that Case and Atkinson were two of the three anonymous authors of \"The Kybalion\", an influential philosophical text, although the introduction to an edition of \"The Kybalion\" released in 2011 has presented considerable evidence for Atkinson as the book's lone author.\n\nCase reported a meeting on the streets of Chicago, in 1909 or 1910, that was to change the course of his life. A \"Dr. Fludd,\" a prominent Chicago physician approached the young Case and greeting him by name, claimed to have a message from a \"master of wisdom\" who, the doctor said, \"is my teacher as well as yours.\"\n\nThe stranger said that Case was being offered a choice. He could continue with his successful musical career and live comfortably, or he could dedicate himself to \"serve humanity\" and thereby play a role in the coming age. From that time on, Case began to study and formulate the lessons that served as the core curricula of the \"Builders of the Adytum\", the school of tarot study and Qabalah that Case founded and that continues today.\n\nIn 1916 Case published a groundbreaking series of articles on the Tarot Keys, titled \"The Secret Doctrine of the Tarot,\" in the popular occult magazine \"The Word\". The articles attracted wide notice in the occult community for organizing and clarifying what had previously been confusing and scattered occult doctrines about the meaning of the tarot cards.\n\nIn 1918, Case met Michael James Whitty (died December 27, 1920 in Los Angeles, California), who was the editor of \"Azoth magazine\" and would become a close friend. Whitty was serving as the 'cancellarius' (treasurer/office manager) for the Thoth-Hermes Lodge in Chicago, which was one of the lodges of the Alpha et Omega (A.O.). Alpha et Omega was the successor organization to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, founded in 1906 by S. L. MacGregor Mathers, after the demise of the Golden Dawn in 1903. Whitty invited Case to join Thoth-Hermes, which was the direct American lodge under the A.O. mother lodge in Paris. Case joined, and quickly moved up initiations in the Rosicrucian grades (True and Invisible Rosicrucian Order). Case's aspiration name in A.O. was Perseverantia (which means 'perseverance').\n\nWhitty republished Case's attribution of the Tarot keys (with corrections) in Azoth magazine. That same year, Case became the 'sub-praemonstrator' (assistant chief instructor) at the Thoth-Hermes Lodge. Also during that year he finished a set of articles on the Mystical Rosicrucian Origins of Faust and published by Whitty. The following year, he began to correspond with Dr. John William Brodie-Innes (Fr. Sub Spe). \n\nBetween 1919 and 1920, Case and Michael Whitty collaborated in the development of the text which would later be published as \"The Book of Tokens\". This book was written as a received text, whether through meditation, automatic writing, or some other means. It later surfaced that Master R. was the source. On May 16, 1920 Case was initiated into Alpha et Omega's Second Order. Three weeks later, according to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn's bio-page on Case, he was named Third Adept. \n\nIn December 1920, Michael Whitty died. Case believed Whitty's health problems were attributable to the dangers that arise or may arise in the practice of Enochian magic. He later corresponded with Israel Regardie about those concerns.\n\nLike his fellow British occultist and later correspondent, Dion Fortune, Case found himself in a controversy with Moina Mathers (1865-1928) in the early 1920s. Perhaps because of his quick advancement through the grades of the order, Case sparked some jealousy among the other adepts. Moreover, others may have thought some of his teachings inappropriate. On July 18, 1921, Mathers wrote Case regarding complaints she had received regarding some of his teachings. Apparently, Case had begun discussing the topics of sexual symbolism and sex magic, which at the time had no official place in the order's curriculum. Since no knowledge lectures exist on the subject, whether sex practices were ever taught in the Golden Dawn has been a long-standing question. In her correspondence with Case, Moina wrote, \"I have seen the results of this superficial sex teaching in several occult societies as well as in individual cases. I have never met with one happy result.\"\n\nBut to Case, sexuality became an increasingly important subject. In his \"Book of Tokens\", a collection of inspired meditations on the 22 Tarot Keys of the Major Arcana, Case comments on the sex function, \"You must wholly alter your conception of sex in order to comprehend the Ancient Wisdom. It is the interior nervous organism, not the external organs, that is always meant in phallic symbolism, and the force that works through these interior centers is the Great Magical Agent, the divine serpent fire.\" In his works, \"The True and Invisible Rosicrucian Order\" and \"The Masonic Letter G\", he writes of certain practices involving the redirection of the sexual force to the higher centers of the brain where experience of supersensory states of consciousness becomes possible.\n\nSome members also complained about a personal relationship between Case and a soror, Lilli Geise. Case confessed the matter to Moina: \"The Hierophantria and I were observed to exchange significant glances over the altar during the Mystic Repast... My conscience acquits me... Our relation to each other we submit to no other Judge than that Lord of Love and Justice whom we all adore.\" In time, Case married Geise, who died a few years later.\n\nPerhaps Moina's correspondence also touched a sensitive area for Case. In her July 18 letter, she tells Case, \"You evidently have reached a point in your mystical Way where there would appear to exist certain cross-roads. The artist in you, which I recognize, and with whom I deeply sympathize, would probably choose to learn the Truth through the joy and beauty of physical life.\" She continued, \"You who have studied the Pantheons, do you know of that enchanting God, the Celtic Angus, the Ever Young? He who is sometimes called Lord of the Land of Heart's Desire?\" Angus rescued Etain, the Moon, who had been turned into a golden fly. But Etain had to choose between bodily existence in the land of mortals and everlasting life. She continued still, \"The artist in us may have lingered in that land for a moment. But you and I who would be teachers and pioneers in this Purgatorial World must be prepared before all the Gods to be the servants of the greatest of them all... the Osiris, the Christ, the God of the Sacrifice of the Self.\" Moina then asked Case to resign from his position as Praemonstrator.\n\nCase resigned as Praemonstrator, responding to Moina, \"I have no desire to be a 'teacher and pioneer in this Purgatorial World.' Guidance seems to have removed me from the high place to which I have never really aspired. The relief is great.\"\n\nApparently Case had already begun work on establishing a mystery school of his own—the School of Ageless Wisdom, which later became Builders Of The Adytum.\n\nAfter Case left Alpha et Omega, he vigorously pursued the organization of his own mystery school. In the summer of 1922, Case put his first efforts together preparing a comprehensive correspondence course. In one year it covered what the B.O.T.A. presently covers in over five years. Some of these materials have recently been published. He called the course The Ageless Wisdom. By 1923 Case formed The School of Ageless Wisdom, probably in Boston. \n\nWithin a few years he moved to Los Angeles, abandoning, once and for all, his career as a musician, and established the Builders of the Adytum (B.O.T.A.). Still in existence today, B.O.T.A. claims to be an authentic mystery school. Over the next three decades, Case organized the curriculum of correspondence lessons covering what is called the Western Mystery Tradition: occult tarot, Qabalah, and hermetic alchemy.\n\nIn the \"Wheel of Life\" magazine, in March 1937, Case described B.O.T.A.'s relationship to the Golden Dawn, and his beliefs about the Golden Dawn's use of Enochian material.\n\n\"B.O.T.A. is a direct off-shoot of the Golden Dawn, but its work has been purged of all the dangerous and dubious magic incorporated into the Golden Dawn's curriculum by the late S.L. MacGregor Mathers, who was responsible for the inclusion of the ceremonials based on the skrying of Sir Edward Kelly.\n\n\"There is much in these Golden Dawn rituals and ceremonies that is of the greatest value; but from the first grade to the last it is all vitiated by these dangerous elements taken from Dee and Kelly. Furthermore, in many places, the practical working is not provided with adequate safeguards, so that, to the present writer's personal knowledge, an operator working with the Golden Dawn [Enochian] rituals runs very grave risks of breaking down his physical organism, or of obsession by evil entities.\"\n\nDr. Paul Clark, in his book on Case, mentions his own examination of the original Cipher manuscripts on which Mathers founded the first order Golden Dawn rituals. Clark found that the \"Cipher manuscripts refer to a set of tablets from the 'Old Manuscripts,' but do not specify Dee or Kelly's work by name. Mather's [sic!] had been doing much research in the British Museum where the Dee manuscripts were housed. It was natural for him, perhaps mistakenly, to assume these were the ones referenced in the Cipher manuscripts. Unfortunately, this was not necessarily the case.\"\n\nCase died while vacationing in Mexico with his second wife, Harriet. His ashes lie in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. According to an American Foreign Service \"Report Of The Death Of An American\" dated March 5, 1954 Case was cremated in Mexico and his ashes given to his wife, Harriet Bullock Case. Upon returning to their home at 5336 Highland\nView Place in Los Angeles, California, Case's ashes were interred in the Haven of Peace Plot, Map 1, Lot 16, Space 4 in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Harriet died on March 24, 1972 in Los Angeles and was interred next to Paul Foster Case in Space 5.\nAnn Davies, married Jacob Fuss on December 18, 1965 and, following her death on June 9, 1975, was buried in Haven of Peace Plot, Map 1, Lot 16, Space 1.\n\nDr. Paul Clark, affiliated with the Fraternity of the Hidden Light, published a biography of Case in 2013, entitled \"Paul Foster Case. His Life and Works\". Besides being an extensive biography of Case (about a hundred pages), the book also includes a number of appendices, including letters from Case to Israel Regardie. Appendix II purports to be communications from Master R. to Case and two of Case's associates and comprises the longest section of the book.\n\nCase's first wife was Lilli Geise, a soror of the Golden Dawn, but the marriage was short lived when she died a few years later (May 9, 1924).\n\nIn 1943 Case married Harriet.\n\nIn 1943 Case was introduced to Ann Davies. She walked into one of his classes with her sister Rosalie. Later, Ann and her small daughter, Bonnie, moved into the Cases' house where they helped by fixing meals, mimeographing lessons, and receiving occult teachings from Mr. Case. Following Paul Foster Case's death in 1954, Ann Davies became and remained the Prolocutor General of the Builders of the Adytum until her death in 1975.\n\nThe Liberal Catholic Church was established in England in 1916 out of the failing Old Catholic missionary effort there. The Old Catholic bishop, Arnold Harris Matthew, had filled his clergy ranks with a number of English Theosophists and Golden Dawn Qabalists, all dedicated students of the 'Ageless Wisdom', which in Theosophy is held to underlie all the world's great religions including Christianity. When Matthew left the movement, he left a valid apostolic succession in the hands of men prepared to teach the Ageless Wisdom and mystical Christianity, and to offer valid Catholic sacraments to all and sundry, but especially to religious non-conformists.\n\nCase was ordained a priest by Bishop Charles Hampton in the Liberal Catholic Church in Ojai, California, in 1937, and served parishes throughout the southern California area.\n\nAccording to the membership archives of the Freemasons Grand Lodge, F. & A.M. of California and in an unpublished biography of Case written by the archivist of the Builders of the Adytum, Case, was affiliated with the following lodges:\n\n\"Fairport Lodge No. 476, Fairport, New York.\"\n\n\"Hollenbeck Lodge No. 319, Los Angeles\"\n\n\"Eagle Rock Lodge No. 422, Los Angeles\" \n\nIn the summer of 1921, Case claimed to have received a phone call from \"The Master Rococzy\" (or Rakoczy, Rákóczy or Rákóczi; also known as the \"Count of St. Germain\" or \"Master R\"), a mysterious personality of whom much is said but about whom are few actual records. Case later allegedly met Master R. in person at the old Waldorf-Astoria in NYC (Madison and Lexington Avenues at 43rd Street). The \"Adytum News\" described it this way: \"One day the phone rang, and much to his surprise the same voice which had been inwardly instructing him in his researches for many years spoke to him on the phone. It was the Master R. who had come personally to New York for the purpose of preparing Paul Case to begin the next incarnation of the Qabalistic Way of Return. ... After three weeks of personal instruction with the Master R., Builders of the Adytum was formed.\" The story is told in more detail in Paul Clark's biography of Case.\n\nCase also purportedly received communications from Master R. The first set of communications resulted in \"The Book of Tokens\", a set of meditations on the Tarot. Further and far more extensive communications were purportedly received some twenty-five years later by Case, along with Ann Davies and Case's wife Harriet, and were published in 2013.\n\nCase left behind extensive published writings on the Western Mystery Tradition, Tarot, Qabalah, Freemasonry, and even more unpublished writings that are circulated today through the Builders of the Adytum as well as through other mystery schools influenced by him, such as the Fraternity of the Hidden Light. He was also the original founder of advanced thought publishing.\n\nSome of the wording from \"The Book of Tokens\" was used in the tarot-inspired musical episode of \"\" entitled The Bitter Suite. In the show, a character representing The Fool speaks the quote, \"ALEPH am I. From mine unfathomable will, the universe hath its beginning. In my boundless wisdom are the types and patterns of all things.\". That same episode also makes numerous visual references to the B.O.T.A. tarot cards.\n\n\"Articles:\"\n\n\"Books:\"\n\n\"Courses published in book form\"\n\nClark, P. (2013) \"Paul Foster Case.

{"id": "1946321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946321", "title": "Monte Testaccio", "text": "Monte Testaccio\n\nMonte Testaccio (alternatively spelled Monte Testaceo; also known as Monte dei cocci) is an artificial mound in Rome composed almost entirely of \"testae\" (), fragments of broken ancient Roman pottery, nearly all discarded amphorae dating from the time of the Roman Empire, some of which were labelled with \"tituli picti\". It is one of the largest spoil heaps found anywhere in the ancient world, covering an area of at its base and with a volume of approximately , containing the remains of an estimated 53 million amphorae. It has a circumference of nearly a kilometre (0.6 mi) and stands 35 metres (115 ft) high, though it was probably considerably higher in ancient times. It stands a short distance away from the east bank of the River Tiber, near the Horrea Galbae where the state-controlled reserve of olive oil was stored in the late 2nd century AD. The mound later had both religious and military significance.\n\nThe huge numbers of broken amphorae at Monte Testaccio illustrate the enormous demand for oil of imperial Rome, which was at the time the world's largest city with a population of at least one million people. It has been estimated that the hill contains the remains of as many as 53 million olive oil amphorae, in which some 6 billion litres (1.3 billion imperial gallons/1.6 billion U.S. gallons) of oil were imported. Studies of the hill's composition suggest that Rome's imports of olive oil reached a peak towards the end of the 2nd century AD, when as many as 130,000 amphorae were being deposited on the site each year. The vast majority of those vessels had a capacity of some ; from this it has been estimated that Rome was importing at least 7.5 million liters (1.6 million imperial gal/2 million U.S. gal) of olive oil annually. As the vessels found at Monte Testaccio appear to represent mainly state-sponsored olive oil imports, it is very likely that considerable additional quantities of olive oil were imported privately.\n\nMonte Testaccio was not simply a haphazard waste dump; it was a highly organised and carefully engineered creation, presumably managed by a state administrative authority. Excavations carried out in 1991 showed that the mound had been raised as a series of level terraces with retaining walls made of nearly intact amphorae filled with shards to anchor them in place. Empty amphorae were probably carried up the mound intact on the backs of donkeys or mules and then broken up on the spot, with the shards laid out in a stable pattern. Lime appears to have been sprinkled over the broken pots to neutralise the smell of rancid oil. \n\nAs the oldest parts of Monte Testaccio are at the bottom of the mound, it is difficult to say with any certainty when it was first created. Deposits found by excavators have been dated to a period between approximately AD 140 to 250, but it is possible that dumping could have begun on the site as early as the 1st century BC. The mound has a roughly triangular shape comprising two distinct platforms, the eastern side being the oldest. At least four distinct series of terraces were built in a stepped arrangement. Layers of small shards were laid down in some places, possibly to serve as paths for those carrying out the waste disposal operations.\n\nThe hill was constructed using mostly the fragments of large globular vessels from Baetica (the Guadalquivir region of modern Spain), of a type now known as Dressel 20. It also included smaller numbers of two types of amphorae from Tripolitania (Libya) and Byzacena (Tunisia). All three types of vessel were used to transport olive oil. However, it is not clear why Monte Testaccio was built using only olive oil vessels. The oil itself was probably decanted into bulk containers when the amphorae were unloaded at the port, in much the same way as other staples such as grain. There is no equivalent mound of broken grain or wine amphorae and the overwhelming majority of the amphorae found at Monte Testaccio are of one single type, which raises the question of why the Romans found it necessary to dispose of the amphorae in this way. \n\nOne possibility is that the Dressel 20 amphora, the principal type found at Monte Testaccio, may have been unusually difficult to recycle. Many types of amphora could be re-used to carry the same type of product or modified to serve a different purpose—for instance, as drain pipes or flower pots. Fragmentary amphorae could be pounded into chips to use in \"opus signinum\", a type of concrete widely used as a building material, or could simply be used as landfill. The Dressel 20 amphora, however, broke into large curved fragments that could not readily be reduced to small shards. It is likely that the difficulty of reusing or repurposing the Dressel 20s meant that it was more economical to discard them.\n\nAnother reason for not re-cycling olive oil amphorae into concrete of the opus signinum type may have been that the fragments were too fatty due to residual oil. Also, oil happens to react chemically with lime (a major component of concrete) and the product of this chemical reaction is soap; the resulting concrete would have had unsatisfactory quality. Wheat amphorae and wine amphorae on the other hand were certainly \"clean\" enough to be re-cycled into concrete.\n\nMonte Testaccio has provided archaeologists with a rare insight into the ancient Roman economy. The amphorae deposited in the mound were often labelled with \"tituli picti\", painted or stamped inscriptions which record information such as the weight of the oil contained in the vessel, the names of the people who weighed and documented the oil and the name of the district where the oil was originally bottled. This has allowed archaeologists to determine that the oil in the vessels was imported under state authority and was designated for the \"annona urbis\" (distribution to the people of Rome) or the \"annona militaris\" (distribution to the army). Indeed, some of the inscriptions found on mid-2nd century vessels at Monte Testaccio specifically record that the oil they once contained was delivered to the \"praefectus annonae\", the official in charge of the state-run food distribution service. It is possible that Monte Testaccio was also managed by the \"praefectus annonae\".\n\nThe \"tituli picti\" on the Monte Testaccio amphorae tend to follow a standard pattern and indicate a rigorous system of inspection to control trade and deter fraud. An amphora was first weighed while empty, and its weight was marked on the outside of the vessel. The name of the export merchant was then noted, followed by a line giving the weight of the oil contained in the amphora (subtracting the previously determined weight of the vessel itself). Those responsible for carrying out and monitoring the weighing then signed their names on the amphora and the location of the farm from which the oil originated was also noted. The maker of the amphora was often identified by a stamp on the vessel's handle. \n\nThe inscriptions also provide evidence of the structure of the oil export business. Apart from single names, many inscriptions list combinations such as \"the two Aurelii Heraclae, father and son\", \"the Fadii\", \"Cutius Celsianus and Fabius Galaticus\", \"the two Junii, Melissus and Melissa\", \"the partners Hyacinthus, Isidore and Pollio\", \"L. Marius Phoebus and the Vibii, Viator and Retitutus.\" This suggests that many of those involved were members of joint enterprises, perhaps small workshops involving business partners, father-son teams and skilled freedmen.\n\nMonte Testaccio's use as an amphora dump seems to have ceased after about the 260s, perhaps due to the city's quays being moved elsewhere. A new type of amphora was also introduced around this time to transport olive oil.\n\nThe area around the hill was largely abandoned after the fall of Rome. A print of 1625 depicts Monte Testaccio standing in isolation in an area of wasteland within the ancient city walls, and even as late as the mid-19th century the surrounding area was little more than a \"romantic desert\" with only \"a few shabby houses\". It was the scene of jousts and tournaments during the Middle Ages, when Monte Testaccio was the scene of pre-Lenten celebrations. As part of the festivities, two carts filled with pigs were hauled to the top of the hill, then released to run back down and smash in pieces at the bottom of the hill, where the watching revellers then dismembered the pigs on the spot for roasting.\n\nMonte Testaccio was still used as a place of recreation when Stendhal visited in 1827. A 19th-century traveller, visiting a few years earlier, described the annual festival that was held on the summit of the hill:\nEach Sunday and Thursday during the month of October, almost the whole population of Rome, rich and poor, throng to this spot, where innumerable tables are covered with refreshments, and the wine is drawn cool from the vaults. It is impossible to conceive a more animating scene than the summit of the hill presents. Gay groups dancing the saltarella, intermingled with the jovial circles which surround the tables; the immense crowd of walkers who, leaving their carriages below, stroll about to enjoy the festive scene ...\n\nThe hill gained a brief military significance in 1849 when it was used as the site of an Italian gun battery, under the command of Giuseppe Garibaldi, in the successful defence of Rome against an attacking French army. Its economic significance was somewhat greater, as the hill's interior was discovered to have unusual cooling properties which investigators attributed to the ventilation produced by its porous structure. This made it ideal for wine storage during the heat of the Roman summer, and caves were excavated for that purpose.\n\nMonte Testaccio also had a religious significance; it was formerly used on Good Friday to represent the hill of Golgotha in Jerusalem, when the Pope would lead a procession to the summit and place crosses to represent those of Jesus and the two thieves crucified alongside him. Monte Testaccio is still crowned with a cross in commemoration of the event. Only after World War II was the area around the hill redeveloped, as a working-class neighbourhood.\n\nThe first archaeological investigation of Monte Testaccio began in January 1872 under the German archaeologist Heinrich Dressel, who published his results in 1878. Further work was carried out in the 1980s by the Spanish archaeologists Emilio Rodríguez Almeida and José Remesal Rodríguez.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1946322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946322", "title": "Katipō", "text": "Katipō\n\nThe katipō (\"Latrodectus katipo)\" is an endangered species of spider native to New Zealand. It is one of many species in the genus \"Latrodectus\", such as the Australian redback (\"L. hasseltii\"), and the North American black widow. The species is venomous to humans, capable of delivering a potentially dangerous bite. It is a small to medium-sized spider, with the female having a round black or brown pea-sized body. Red katipō females, found in the South Island and the lower half of the North Island, are always black, and their abdomen has a distinctive red stripe bordered in white. In black katipō females, found in the upper half of the North Island, this stripe is absent, pale, yellow, or replaced with cream-coloured blotches. These two forms were previously thought to be separate species. The male is much smaller than the female and quite different in appearance: white with black stripes and red diamond-shaped markings. Katipō are mainly found living in sand dunes close to the seashore. They are found throughout most of coastal New Zealand except the far south and west. Katipō feed mainly on ground dwelling insects, caught in an irregular tangled web spun amongst dune plants or other debris,\n\nAfter mating in August or September, the female katipō produces five or six egg sacs in November or December. The spiderlings hatch during January and February and disperse into surrounding plants. Due to habitat loss and colonisation of their natural habitat by other exotic spiders, the katipō is threatened with extinction.\n\nA katipō bite produces the toxic syndrome latrodectism; symptoms include extreme pain and, potentially, hypertension, seizure, or coma. Bites are rare, an antivenom is available, and no deaths have been reported since 1901. The katipō is particularly notable in New Zealand as the nation is almost entirely devoid of dangerous native wildlife; this unique status means the spider is well known, despite being rarely seen.\n\nAlthough the 'kātĕpo' was reported to the Linnean Society as early as 1855, the spider was formally described as \"Latrodectus katipo\" by L. Powell in 1870. Spiders of the genus \"Latrodectus\" have a worldwide distribution and include all of the commonly known widow spiders: the North American black widow spider (\"Latrodectus mactans\"), the brown widow (\"Latrodectus geometricus\"), and the European black widow (\"Latrodectus tredecimguttatus\"). The katipō's closest relative is the Australian redback spider (\"Latrodectus hasseltii\") \"Latrodectus katipo\" and \"L. atritus\" (black katipō) were previously thought to be two separate species, but research has shown that they are a single species, \"L. katipo\", with colour variation that is clinal over latitude and correlated with mean annual temperature. The katipō is so closely related to the redback that it was at one stage thought to be a subspecies, with the proposed name \"Latrodectus hasseltii katipo\". Further research has shown that the katipō is distinct from the redback, having slight structural differences and striking differences in habitat preference, and it remains a distinct species. The katipō's family Theridiidae has a large number of species both in New Zealand and worldwide. They are commonly known as tangle-web spiders, cobweb spiders or comb-footed spiders.\n\nThe common name katipō (singular and plural), often spelled \"katipo\", is from the Māori for \"night stinger\", derived from the words \"kakati\" (to sting) and \"pō\" (the night). This name was apparently given to the species owing to the Māori belief that the spiders bite at night. Other common names include \"red katipō\", \"black katipō\" and \"New Zealand's redback\".\n\nThe katipō is a small to medium-sized spider. The mature female has a body size of about with a leg span of up to . The red katipō female, found in the South Island and the lower North Island, has a large black globular abdomen, about the size of a garden pea, with slender legs and a white-bordered orange or red stripe on its back that runs from the uppermost surface of the abdomen back to the spinnerets. The dark velvet-black abdomen is described as satin or silky in appearance, rather than being shiny. The underside of the abdomen is black and has a red patch or partial red hourglass-shaped marking. It has mainly black legs with the extremities changing to brown. The black katipō female, found in the upper North Island, does not have a red stripe on the top of its body, and the abdominal colouration is usually lighter, but is otherwise very similar in appearance to the red katipō. The hourglass pattern on the underside of the abdomen may also be less distinct, losing the middle section, and may even be absent. Variations also exist where the abdomen, cephalothorax, or entire body is brown, sometimes with a dull red or yellow stripe, or cream-coloured spots on its upper side. These different forms were at one point thought to be different species, but a 2008 study demonstrated they were different morphs of the same species.\n\nAdult males and juveniles are quite different in appearance to the female. They are smaller in size, being about one sixth the size of an adult female. Juveniles have a brown carapace, with a predominantly white abdomen which has a series of red-orange diamonds running along the dorsal region bordered on either side by irregular black lines. Males retain this coloration into adulthood. Due to its much smaller size, Urquhart (1886) believed the male to be a separate species and named it \"Theridion melanozantha\". This was not rectified until 1933 when it was correctly identified as the male \"Latrodectus katipo\".\n\nThe katipō is restricted to a highly specialised habitat and is only found near the seashore among sand dunes. They generally reside on the landward side of dunes closest to the coast where they are most sheltered from storms and sand movement. They can sometimes be associated with dunes several kilometres from the sea when these dunes extend inland for long distances.\n\nWebs are typically established in low-growing dune plants and other vegetation such as the native pīngao (\"Desmoschoenus spiralis\") or the introduced marram grass (\"Ammophila arenaria\"). They may also build their webs under driftwood, stones, or other debris such as empty tin cans or bottles. Webs are almost always constructed over open sand and near the ground so as to catch crawling insects for food. Spiders inhabiting dune grasses construct their webs in open spaces between the grass tufts, while spiders inhabiting areas of shrubbery do so on the underside of a plant overhanging open sand. It has been found that these patches of open sand are necessary for katipō to build their webs as plants that envelop sand dunes in dense cover, such as exotic plants like kikuyu or buffalo grass, create an environment unsuitable for web construction. The katipō therefore prefers to spin its web amongst pīngao plants as this plant's growth pattern leaves patches of sand between each plant. The wind can then blow insects and other prey through these gaps and into the web. Marram grass has been extensively planted in New Zealand to help stabilise sand dunes and has largely replaced pīngao in many areas. Because marram grass grows in a very tight formation only leaving small gaps between tuffs, this makes it difficult for the katipō to construct a suitable web for capturing prey.\n\nLike other theridiid spiders, the web is a disorganised, irregular tangle of fine textured silk. It is hammock-shaped and is made up of opaque yellowish-white silk. The web consists of a broad base with many supporting threads above and below, including a number of sticky guy lines anchored to debris in the sand. A cone-shaped retreat is built in the lower part of the web, although the katipō can normally be found near the main body of the web. The plants it builds its web in provide support and shelter for the nest.\n\nThe katipō is endemic to New Zealand. In the North Island it is found along the West Coast from Wellington to North Cape. On the east coast of the North Island it occurs irregularly, however, it is abundant on Great Barrier Island. In the South Island it is found in coastal regions south to Dunedin on the east coast and south to Greymouth on the west coast. This southern limit is due to the katipō needing temperatures higher than about to be maintained during the development of their eggs – in the southern areas of New Zealand it is typically colder than this.\n\nThe red katipō is found south of approximately 39°15′ S (the western tip of Taranaki on the west coast, and just north of Waipatiki Beach in Hawke's Bay on the east coast). The black katipō is found north of approximately 38° S (Aotea Harbour, just north of Kawhia on the west coast, and Waipiro Bay and just south of the Bay of Plenty on the east coast). Both forms are found in the area inbetween these latitudes.\n\nThe katipō typically catches wandering ground invertebrates such as beetles (e.g. \"Cecyropa modesta\") or amphipods (e.g. \"Bellorchestia quoyana\"), but it may occasionally catch moths, flies, and other spiders. Katipō can catch insects much larger than themselves. These larger insects often become entangled in the web and in the ensuing struggle, the web's ground anchor line breaks. The silk's elasticity causes the prey to become suspended a few centimetres off the ground. The katipō then moves to the prey, turns so that the spinnerets are facing the insect and spins silk over it. Like most theridiids, the tarsi of the hind legs have a row of strong curved bristles which are arranged as a comb. The katipō uses these to scoop sticky silk from its spinnerets and throws it over the insect with a series of rapid movements. After the insect is firmly immobilised, the spider bites it several times, usually at the joints, before spinning more silk to strengthen the web, and then administering a last long bite which ultimately kills the insect. The spider then moves the prey up into the web until it is ready to eat. If food is readily available then it is common to see five or six insects hanging in the web waiting to be ingested. The male's hunting behaviour is similar to the female's, although may not be as vigorous due to its smaller size.\n\nThe male wanders as an adult and in August or September goes looking for the females' webs to mate. The male will enter the female's web and vibrate the silk as he approaches her. The female is usually aggressive at first and will chase the male from the web. The courtship process consists of the male bobbing, plucking and tweaking the web along with periods of cautious approach and being chased by the female. Eventually, when she becomes docile and allows him to approach, the male will then approach the female as she hangs quietly upside down in the web. The male moves onto her ventral abdomen, tapping her rapidly until she moves to align his abdomen above hers. He then inserts his palps one at a time, leaving the female between each insertion. Copulation occurs over 10 to 30 minutes. After mating, the male retreats to groom, which is performed by running his palps and legs through his fangs and wiping them over his body. The male is not eaten by the female unlike some other widow spiders.\n\nThe females lay their eggs in November or December. The eggs are round, about the size of a mustard seed, and are a transparent, purplish red. They are held together in a cream-coloured, round, ball shaped egg sac which is about in diameter. The female constructs five or six egg sacs over the next three to four weeks. Each egg sac contains about 70 to 90 fertilised eggs. The egg sacs are hung in the centre of the spider's web and the female spins more silk over them. Over time, the exterior of the egg sac may become covered with sand. After six weeks of incubation, during January and February, the spiderlings hatch. The young spiders then disperse from the web. Little is known about the dispersal mechanism that the spiderlings use to move away from the nest. In one study, observing spiders over 24 hours, 28% used a ballooning method, which is where the young spiders use air currents to carry themselves away from the nest suspended by a single web strand, while the majority, 61%, used a bridging method where the spiderling uses its silk to move to nearby plants, and 11% still remained in the nest. The young spiderlings reach full maturity the following spring.\n\nThe close relationship between the katipō and redback is shown when mating. A male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipō producing hybrid offspring. However, a male katipō cannot mate with the female redback as the male katipō is heavier than the male redback, and when it approaches the web it triggers a predatory response in the female leading to the male being eaten before mating occurs. There is evidence of interbreeding between katipō and redbacks in the wild.\n\nThe katipō has only one known direct predator: a small, undescribed native wasp from the family Ichneumonidae has been observed feeding on katipō eggs.\n\nThe katipō is an endangered species and has recently become threatened with extinction. It is estimated that there are only a few thousand katipō left in about 50 areas in the North Island and eight areas in the South Island, making it rarer than some species of kiwi. A number of factors have contributed to its decline; the major ones appear to be loss of habitat and the declining quality of the remaining habitat. Human interference with their natural habitat has been occurring for over a century following European settlement. Coastal dune modification resulting from agriculture, forestry, or urban development, along with recreational activities like the use of beach buggies, off-road vehicles, beach horse riding and driftwood collection have destroyed or changed areas where katipō lives. The introduction of many invasive exotic plants has also contributed to the decline of suitable habitat.\nForeign spiders have colonised areas where suitable habitat remains. The major coloniser is the South African spider \"Steatoda capensis\". It was first reported in the 1990s and may have displaced the katipō along the west coast of the North Island from Wellington to Whanganui, although both the katipō and \"S. capensis\" have been found sharing the same dune systems or even co-existing under the same piece of driftwood, suggesting that the two species can co-exist in similar habitats. It is possible that the displacement of the katipō by \"S. capensis\" is due to its ability to recolonise areas from which the katipō had been displaced after storms or other dune modifications. Furthermore, \"S. capensis\" breeds year-round, produces more offspring and lives in a greater range of habitats which leads to greater pressure on the katipō. \"S. capensis\" also belongs to the family Theridiidae and shares many of the katipō's features. It is of similar size, shape, general coloration, but it lacks the red stripe on its back, and may have some red, orange or yellow on its abdomen. Due to these similarities it is commonly known in New Zealand as the \"false katipō\".\n\nIn 2010 the katipō was one of a dozen species of previously-unprotected invertebrate given full protection under the 1953 Wildlife Act, noted as \"iconic, vulnerable to harm, and in serious decline\". Under the Act, killing an absolutely-protected species such as a katipō is punishable by a fine or even imprisonment.\n\nThe katipō has venom that is medically significant in humans, although bites are rare. The incidence of bites is low as it is a shy, non-aggressive spider. Their narrow range, diminishing population, and human awareness of where they live means humans rarely encounter katipō. The katipō will only bite as a last resort; if molested, the spider will usually fold up into a ball and drop to the ground or retreat to the nearest cover. If the threat continues, the spider may throw out silk against the interference. When restrained in any way or held against skin, such as if tangled up in clothing, the spider will then bite defensively. However, if the female is with an egg sac it will remain close by it and sometimes move offensively to bite any threat.\n\nBites from katipō spiders produce a syndrome known as latrodectism. The venoms of all \"Latrodectus\" spiders are thought to contain similar components with the neurotoxin α-latrotoxin being the main agent responsible. Most bites are caused by female spiders; the male katipō was considered too small to cause systemic envenoming in humans. However, bites from male redback spiders have been reported, suggesting male \"Latrodectus\" spiders can cause envenoming in humans. Bites by male spiders are much rarer than those by females, perhaps due to their smaller jaws rather than lacking venom of similar potency to females or being unable to administer an effective bite. Māori legends recall many deaths, the last of which appears to have been a Māori girl who – according to the missionary Thomas Chapman – died in approximately 1849. While there were reports of severe katipō bites in 19th or early 20th century records, no other fatalities from spider bites have since been reported in New Zealand. The most recent fatality seems to have been in 1901, as reported in the Evening Post on 25 September of that year: \"AUCKLAND, This Day. Mr. George Twidle, aged 47, son of Mr. George Twidle of Pukekohe, was bitten by a katipo spider on September 16. His arm swelled, and he suffered great pain till Saturday last, when he died. He leaves a widow and several children.\" The most recent reported katipō bites () were to a Canadian tourist in 2010 and a kayaker in 2012.\n\nThe clinical features of latrodectism are similar for all species of \"Latrodectus\" spiders. It is generally characterised by extreme pain. Initially, the bite may be painful, but sometimes only feels like a pin prick or mild burning sensation. Within an hour victims generally develop more severe local pain with local sweating and sometimes piloerection (goosebumps). Pain, swelling and redness spread proximally from the site. Less commonly, systemic envenoming is heralded by swollen or tender regional lymph nodes; associated features include malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, generalised sweating, headache, fever, hypertension and tremor. Rare complications include seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure or localised skin infection. The duration of effects can range from a few hours to days, with severe pain persisting for over 24 hours after being bitten in some cases.<ref name=\"isbister/gray\"></ref>\n\nTreatment is based on the severity of the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care, and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and routine analgesics. Hospital assessment is recommended if simple analgesia does not resolve local pain or clinical features of systemic envenoming occur. In more severe bites, redback antivenom can be given. Redback antivenom can also cross-neutralise katipō venom, and it is used to treat envenoming from \"Latrodectus katipo\" in New Zealand. It is available from most major New Zealand hospitals. Antivenom will usually relieve the symptoms of systemic envenoming and is indicated in anyone suffering symptoms consistent with \"Latrodectus\" envenoming. Unlike some other antivenoms, it is not limited to patients with signs of severe, systemic envenoming. Particular indications for using antivenom are local then generalised pain, sweating or hypertension. However, good evidence to support the effectiveness of widow spider antivenoms is lacking and studies have cast some doubt on the efficacy of antivenoms in latrodectism. Pain relief agents, such as parenteral opiates, or benzodiazepines may be required as adjunct agents.\n\n"}

There is a small adjoining island that is separated at high tide, called Chera Dwip. It is about west of the northwest coast of Myanmar, at the mouth of the Naf River.\n\nMillennia ago, the island used to be an extension of the Teknaf peninsula, but at a later time some portion of this peninsula got submerged and thus the southernmost part of the aforementioned peninsula became an island, and was disconnected from the Bangladesh mainland. The first settlement started 250 years ago by Arabian sailors who named the island 'Jazeera'. During British occupation the island was named after the then Deputy Commissioner of Chittagong Mr. Martin as St. Martin Island. The local names of the island are \"Narikel jinjira\" which means 'Coconut Island', and \"Daruchini Dwip\" which means \"Cinnamon island\". It is the only coral island in Bangladesh.\n\nThe island makes up the Saint Martin's Union Parishad. It has 9 villages/areas:\n\n\nMost of the island's approximately 3,700 inhabitants live primarily from fishing. The other staple crops are rice and coconut. Being very common on the island, algae are collected, dried, and exported to Myanmar. Between October and April, the fishermen from neighboring areas bring their caught fishes to the island's temporary wholesale market. However, imports of chicken, meat and other foods come in from the mainland Bangladesh and Myanmar. As the centre and the south are mainly farmland and makeshift huts, most of the permanent structures are around the far north.\n\nDuring the rainy season, because of the dangerous conditions on the Bay of Bengal, the inhabitants have no scope to go to the mainland (Teknaf) and their life can become dangerous. There is a hospital on the island, but in the past there has often been no doctor.\n\nThe only way to reach St. Martin's Island is by water transportation: boats and ships (mostly for tourists) from Cox Bazar and Teknaf. The only internal transport for island is non motorized van (pulled by man.) The roads are made of concrete, and their condition are decent. All the hotels run generators until 11 PM which are not allowed afterwards, so they then rely on solar power, which is popular throughout the island. There is no electricity supply from the national grid since a hurricane in 1991. The island is all about sun, sea and palm trees. During the day, it comes alive with water and beach sports, with beach parties and bonfires lighting up the evening skies.\n\nFrom 1989 to 2004, non-residential Bangladeshis and foreigners were the only people permitted on the island; however, this has changed and now residential Bangladeshis are allowed. St. Martin's Island has become a tourist spot, and five shipping liners run daily trips to the island. Tourists can book their trip either from Chittagong or from Cox's Bazar. The surrounding coral reef has an extension named Chera Dwip. A small bush is there, which is the only green part. People do not live on this part, so it is advisable for the tourists to go there early and come back by afternoon.\n\nA number of efforts have been proposed to preserve the several endangered species of turtles that nest on the island, as well as the corals, some of which are found only on Narikel Jinjira. Pieces of the coral reef are being removed to be sold to tourists. Nesting turtles are sometimes taken for food, and their hatchlings are often distracted by the twinkling lights along the beach. Fish, a few recently discovered, are being overfished. Every year the fishermen must venture further out to sea to get their catch. Most of them use motorless boats.\n\nIt is possible to walk around the island in a day because it measures only 8 km (3 sq. mile), shrinking to about 5 km (2 sq. mi) during high tide. The island exists only because of its coral base, so removal of that coral risks erosion of the beach. Because of this, St. Martin's has lost roughly 25% of its coral reef in the past seven years.\n\nFishing is one of largest professional activities of St. Martin's Island's 5,500 residents; however, territorial disputes between Myanmar and Bangladesh have resulted in a state of tension between the countries that can erupt into violence, often targeting unarmed Bangladeshi fishermen. Below is a brief summary of shooting incidents against St. Martin's fishermen: \n\nThe best weather is usually between November and February; this is the major tourist season. Between March and July, cyclones can strike. The island was devastated by a cyclone in 1991 but has fully recovered, and was untouched by the 2004 tsunami. Thus, March to July is off-season for tourists.\n\n\n\n"}

Peter Hollander Ridder was serving in the Swedish Navy when he was appointed as governor of New Sweden. After a difficult journey he arrived to New Sweden, together with a handful of settlers, on board the \"Kalmar Nyckel\" on her second expedition April 17, 1640.

There are many types of environmental consultants, but the two main groups are those who enter the field from the industry side, and those who enter the field from the environmentalist side.\n\nEnvironmental consultants work in a very wide variety of fields. Whether it be providing construction services such as Asbestos Hazard Assessments or Lead Hazard Assessments or conducting due diligence reports for customers to rid them of possible sanctions. Consultancies may generalize across a wide range of disciplines or specialize in certain areas of environmental consultancy such as waste management.\n\nEnvironmental consultants usually have an undergraduate degree and sometimes even master's degree in Environmental Engineering, Environmental Science, Environmental Studies, Geology, or some other science discipline. They should have deep knowledge on environmental regulations, which they can advise particular clients in the private industry or public government institutions to help them steer clear of possible fines, legal action or misguided transactions.\n\nEnvironmental consulting spans a wide spectrum of industry. The most basic industry that environmental consulting remains prominent in is the commercial estate market. Many commercial lenders rely on both small and large environmental firms. Many commercial lenders will not lend monies to borrowers if the property or personal capital does not exceed the worth of the land. If an environmental problem is discovered property owners that deem themselves a responsible party will most likely reserve monies in escrow in order to resolve the environmental impact.\n\nWith increasing numbers of construction, agriculture, and scientific companies employing environmental consultancies, the industry can expect growth in the vicinity of 9.7 percent in 2008, amidst mounting public concern over environmental degradation and climate change. And while some companies are genuinely motivated by concern for the environment, for others, hiring consultants to appear to be \"going green\" has proven to be a useful marketing tool. Growing government funding into renewable energy and technologies producing low emissions is also helping growth, as organizations investing in research and development in these areas are often major employers of environmental consultants.\n\nThere are numerous areas in which environmental consultants might work (in no particular order):\n\nContaminated Land is one area as mentioned above. Contaminated Land this may well involve a Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment\n\nEnergy may entail feasibility studies for renewable energy projects. For example, a study may attempt to answer the question: Would a micro-hydro-generation scheme pay for itself over the course of its operational life?\n\nGeotechnical may also be covered by Environmental Consultants, this might include activities such as site investigations, geotechnical engineering (foundation design, slope stability), and restoration quality assurance.\n\nEnvironmental Management Systems such as ISO 14001 are large complicated systems that are often not implemented using internal man/woman power. This work is usually outsourced to consultants.\n\nGreen Claims Environmental Consultants may be employed to substantiate green claims, such as eco labels, which may involve work on supply chain or embodied carbon.\n\nCompliance As governments become more and more environmental in their thinking, so does their legal framework. In the UK, businesses are covered by numerous pieces of legislation such as oil storage regulations and The Environment Act. If they are found to be in breach of these regulations they may face severe civil or criminal actions. Environmental Consultants can check to see that the business in question is in compliance with current legislation.\n\nImpact Assessment see Environmental impact statement\n\nFlood Risk, the most common of which may be a Phase 1 Screening Study.\n\nAsbestos Management\n\nRadon\n\nCarbon there are various aspects of a company's carbon foot print that may be managed by consultants. They may have internal reduction strategies, or they may be tied in with national targets. Emissions trading is also an important aspect of Carbon Management.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1946366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946366", "title": "Austrian Football Bundesliga", "text": "Austrian Football Bundesliga\n\nThe Austrian Football Bundesliga ( , Austrian Football Federal League) is the highest-ranking national league club competition in Austrian football. The competition decides the Austrian national football champions, as well the country's entrants for the various European cups run by UEFA. Since Austria stayed in sixteenth place in the UEFA association coefficient rankings at the end of the 2015–16 season, the league gained its first spot for the UEFA Champions League.\nThe Austrian Bundesliga, which began in the 1974–75 season, has been a separate registered association since 1 December 1991. It has been most won by the two Viennese giants Austria Wien, who were national champions 21 times, and Rapid Wien, who won the national title 32 times. Rapid’s Last title was in the 2007–08 Season. The current champions are Red Bull Salzburg. Phillip Thonhauser is president of the Austrian Bundesliga.\nThe Austrian Football Bundesliga is currently known as \"Tipico Bundesliga\" for sponsorship reasons.\n\nFootball has been played in Austria since around 1890. Around the turn of the twentieth century two attempts were made to start a national championship. From 1900 onwards, a cup competition was played in Vienna, the \"Neues Wiener Tagblatt Pokal\". This cup was actually played in league format.\nThe efforts to create a football league succeeded in 1911, with the introduction of the first Austrian football championship. The competition for this championship, the \"1. Klasse\" (\"First Class\"), was created and organized by the \"Niederösterreichischer Fußball-Verband\" (the Lower Austrian Football Federation), and the participants played for the title of \"Niederösterreichische Landesmeister\" (Lower Austrian National Champion). From 1924, the league was considered professional and changed its name to \"I. Liga\" (\"First League\").\nIn 1929, an all-Austrian amateur championship was first played, won by Grazer AK. Clubs from the professional league in Vienna were not part of this competition. Teams from the other states of Austria were first allowed to join the highest division with the introduction of the \"Nationalliga\" (\"National League\") in the season of 1937–38.\n\nAustria's annexation by Germany in 1938 brought the Austrian Nationalliga to an early end. Numerous teams were disbanded and some players fled out of the country. The Austrian Nationalliga was integrated into the system of the NSRL, the Sports office of the Third Reich as the Gau XVII section under \"Gaufachwart\" Hans Janisch. Despised by Nazis as unworthy of a true German, professionalism in sports was outlawed in May 1938. \"Innovations\" like the Hitler salute were introduced as compulsory before and after every game. Teams, like Hakoah Wien were banned and others, like Austria Wien were first closed and then renamed. Finally, the operation of the junior teams was handed over to the local Hitlerjugend units.\nThe new highest league in what had been Austria, the \"Gauliga Ostmark\", was an amateur league and covered the whole of the former country except Tyrol and Vorarlberg, which were added to the Bavarian league system. The league champions now qualified for the German football championship, which Rapid Wien won in 1941. From 1941, the league was renamed \"Gauliga Donau-Alpenland\" to further eradicate the memory of Austria as an independent country.\nFollowing Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II and the disbandment of the NSRL, Austria's teams were excluded again from the German league.\nThe league returned to a Vienna-only format in 1945, briefly named \"1. Klasse\" once more before changing to just \"Liga\" in 1946.\nOnly upon the introduction of the all-Austrian \"Staatsliga A\" in 1949 did teams from the whole federal territory finally play for the Austrian Championship. However, the road to organising the Staatsliga proved difficult. A conflict between the representatives of the amateur and the professional aspects of the sport led to the separation of the Viennese league from the football federation, and to the establishment of its own competition on 30 June 1949. At the statutory Presidential Election Council of the Austrian Football Association only a few days later a surprising turn took place – upon the request of Lower Austria, the introduction of the \"Staatsliga\" was finally and unanimously confirmed. The organization was in the hands of the Fußballstaatsliga Österreich, created for this purpose. A \"Staatsliga B\", the second division of national league football, was formed in 1950. This league, however, was disbanded again in 1959, whereby the \"Staatsliga A\" dropped the \"A\" from its name, the need for differentiating having been gone.\nIn 1965, however, the Austrian Football Association again took over the organization of the top division, with the (second) introduction of the \"Nationalliga\".\nOn 21 April 1974, against the vote of the Vorarlberg association, the introduction of the \"Bundesliga\" was decided. The \"Nationalliga\" remained as the second division, for now.\n\nIn the 1974–75 season the Bundesliga was introduced which, still led by the Austrian Football Association, aligned both of the highest divisions in Austria. In 1976, the \"Nationalliga\" was renamed to \"Bundesliga – Second Division\" while the \"Bundesliga\" was now called \"Bundesliga – First Division\".\nFrom 1974 to 1982 the league operated with ten clubs with each club playing the other four times during the season. From 1982 to 1985 it played with sixteen clubs with each club playing the others twice. The league's modus was changed in 1985 to a twelve team league which played a home -and away round in autumn. The top eight clubs then advanced to the championship round (Officially: \"Oberes Play-off\") who again played each other twice. The bottom four of the autumn round played the top four of the First League to determine the four teams to play in the Bundesliga in the following season. This modus was used for the next eight seasons until 1993 when the league returned to the ten team format it originally operated in.\n26 years after dissolution of the independent Staatsliga on 17 November 1991, the Austrian Football Bundesliga was reconstituted as a federation and admitted on 1 December 1991 to the Austrian Football Association as its 10th member.\nBeginning with the 2018-19 season the league expanded from its current 10 teams to 12 teams.\n\nSince 1991 the Bundesliga has carried its own responsibility as a separate association, and organises the championships of the two highest divisions in Austria. Both are named after their sponsors; since 2014 the Bundesliga is named after sports-betting company, Tipico. The second division, called the \"Erste Liga\" or \"First League,\" is sponsored by Sky Go. In addition the Bundesliga is responsible for the Toto Jugendliga, leagues for under 15/17/19 Teams of professional Clubs and academies. The Bundesliga also represents professional football in Austria, in co-operation with the football clubs themselves.\nThe Bundesliga is legally a non-profit organisation. The twenty teams of the Tipico Bundesliga and the Sky Go Erste Liga constitute the members of the Bundesliga. The Bundesliga is represented by an acting executive committee, which supports a supervisory board. Each association of the two professional leagues is represented in presidential conferences; these have advisory function in all affairs concerning the Bundesliga.\n\nThe 'senates' are organising committees which consist of honorary and committee-members independent of the clubs. The first senate is responsible for suspensions and for the running of championship games. The second senate functions as an arbitration board for financial disagreements, the third senate is responsible for all financial concerns and the fourth senate is the panel of referees for the Bundesliga.\nThe evaluation of a club's economic competency which is required in order to obtain a playing license for the two professional leagues takes place at the fifth senate, the Bundesliga license committee.\nThe Austrian Bundesliga carries the obligation for a positive development of football as a sport at the élite level, as well as for the advancement of the next generation of players in co-operation with the teams at the junior levels of the sport. To accomplish this, the Bundesliga requires economic audits of the teams, the introduction of laws particular to professional football, TV marketing, centralised sponsorship and collective marketing for all teams.\nIn the Tipico Bundesliga, 10 teams play a \"double championship\" with each team playing every other twice at home and twice away during a championship year which is divided into an autumn and a spring season. The season typically lasts from July to June of the following year. At the end of the season, the team finishing in last place in the table is relegated to the Sky Go Erste Liga, the champion of which is promoted to the Tipico Bundesliga.\nThe Bundesliga champion and the second placed team qualify for the UEFA Champions League, and the clubs at positions 3 and 4, as well as the Austrian Cup winner, enter the qualification rounds for the UEFA Europa League. In the event that the Bundesliga champion is also the Austrian Cup winner, the fifth placed team enters the UEFA Europa League.\n\nNotes:\n\n\nThe following data indicates Austrian coefficient rankings between European football leagues.\n\nUEFA League Ranking as of 15 March 2019:\n\nUEFA 5-year Club Ranking as of 15 March 2019:\n\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a from 1943 to 1959, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Stuart Garson and Douglas Campbell.\n\nBorn at High Bluff, on 8 June 1899, son of Gardner Greenlay and Eliza Donnelly, he was educated at High Bluff and the Portage Collegiate Institute. He ran a garage at High Bluff until 1930, when he entered political life. On 8 November 1930, he married Gladys B. Northcott, daughter of George H. Northcott, of Portage la Prairie. Together they had three children: Norma, Gayle, and Andrew. He was also active member of the Methodist Church, and was instrumental in the formation of the United Church in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nGreenlay first entered political life in 1930 as the Secretary-Treasurer of the Rural Municipality of Portage la Prairie. In 1943, persuaded by his childhood friend, Douglas Lloyd Campbell, to pursue Provincial politics, he was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election held on November 18, 1943, replacing William Raymond Sexsmith. At this time, Manitoba was governed by a coalition of Liberal-Progressives and Conservatives. Running in Portage la Prairie, Greenlay easily won election as a pro-coalition Conservative. Shortly after his election, the Conservatives renamed themselves as Progressive Conservatives.\n\nGreenlay was re-elected as a coalition Progressive Conservative in the general election of 1945, defeating opponents from the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and Labour Progressive Party. On February 14, 1946, he was appointed to Stuart Garson's cabinet as Provincial Secretary. When Douglas Campbell replaced Garson as Premier of Manitoba on December 14, 1948, he named Greenlay as his Minister of Labour. Greenlay would hold this portfolio until 1958, usually in tandem with other ministerial responsibilities.\n\nGreenlay was re-elected without opposition in the 1949 provincial election. The following year, the Progressive Conservatives left the coalition government to sit on the opposition benches. Greenlay opposed this decision, and left the Progressive Conservatives to sit as a Liberal-Progressive. He was named Provincial Secretary again on February 13, 1950, also retaining the Minister of Labour portfolio.\n\nGreenlay was re-elected as a Liberal-Progressive in the 1953 election, defeating his Progressive Conservative opponent by 324 votes. After a cabinet shuffle on September 4, 1953, he was named Minister of Mines and Natural Resources. During this time, he was instrumental in the leadership to create a recreational area for all Manitobans to enjoy, the Whiteshell Provincial Park. On July 6, 1956, he was promoted to Provincial Treasurer.\n\nThe Liberal-Progressives were defeated by the Progressive Conservatives in the 1958 provincial election, although Greenlay was re-elected in Portage la Prairie with an increased majority. In the 1959 election, however, he lost his seat to Progressive Conservative candidate John Christianson by 473 votes. Manitoba CCF leader Lloyd Stinson once described Greenlay as \"a mild, quiet little man, not lacking in ability but essentially cautious and stubborn\". Likeable on a personal level, he was a very conservative administrator. His decision to switch parties in 1950 was met with little controversy.\n\nFollowing his defeat to J. A. Christianson in the 1959 general election, he returned to municipal government as Secretary-Treasurer of the Municipality of Charleswood, serving there until retirement in 1968.\nUpon retiring, Greenlay and his wife, Gladys, relocated back to Portage la Prairie, where he lived until his death in 1984. During his entire life, Greenlay maintained a cottage at Delta Beach, where he enjoyed fishing, hunting, as well as entertaining many friends and family.\n\nHe died in Portage la Prairie at the age of 84.\n\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Liberal-Progressive from 1953 to 1959, and in the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal from 1962 to 1968. Teillet was a cabinet minister in the government of Lester B. Pearson, and retained that post after Pearson stepped down and Pierre Elliott Trudeau became the new Liberal leader.\n\nRoger was born into one of Manitoba's well-known Métis families. Born on River Road in St. Vital, Manitoba, to Sara Riel and Camille Teillet, Roger Teillet was a direct descendant of Marie-Anne Gaboury and Jean-Baptiste Lagimodière, who were the first white settlers in Canada's west and also were the grandparents of Louis Riel. Roger was the grandson of Joseph Riel, Louis Riel's younger brother.\n\nRoger was educated in St. Vital and St. Boniface schools, and at St. Boniface College. He continued his studies as a prisoner-of-war in Germany, where an educational program using the expertise of prisoners had been set up.\n\nRoger was a flight lieutenant in the Royal Canadian Air Force and a navigator on a Halifax bomber in World War II. He took part in 24 successful bombing missions over Germany before being shot down over France in 1943. After evading German soldiers for 15 days, he was captured at the Rivière Cher, and spent almost three years as a prisoner of war in Stalag Luft III, southeast of Berlin in the then province of Silesia. The camp was located at Sagan, now in Polish territory and called Zagan. Conditions in this camp were not as brutal as in many others because it was a camp specifically for officers, and officers were not subject to forced labour. Stalag Luft III was made famous after the war because of Paul Brickhill's book, \"The Great Escape\", a book which was also made into a movie.\n\nIn January 1945, prisoners from camps all over Germany were herded from the camps and forced to walk the length and breadth of Germany, in an effort to evade the encroaching Allied armies. On May 5, 1945, Roger and the others were turned over to the British Army not far from Bremen. Their guards surrendered and the prisoners were airlifted to Brussels.\n\nUpon his return to Canada, Roger went into the insurance business in Winnipeg. He was a member of the Knights of Columbus and active in his Catholic parish of Précieux-sang. When his two sons, Philippe and Richard, were in school, he became a trustee in the separate school system.\n\nRoger had always been involved in politics. He was involved with the L'Union Nationale Métisse. He was a party organizer before ever going overseas, and was an original members of the St. Vital Young Liberals when still a teenager. Now, in the post-war years, he became very active in the Manitoba Liberal Association, acting as the vice-president. He also served in many capacities on the federal liberal party's executive in Winnipeg South Centre.\n\nRoger was first elected to the Manitoba Legislature in the 1953 provincial election, finishing atop the polls in the constituency of St. Boniface, which in those days elected two members via a single transferable ballot. For the next five years, Roger sat as a backbencher in Premier Douglas Lloyd Campbell's government.\n\nManitoba abandoned its multi-member constituencies in 1956, and Roger was re-elected for the now single-member seat of St. Boniface in the 1958 provincial election. The Liberal-Progressives were defeated in this election, and Roger did not seek re-election in 1959.\n\nRoger ran for a seat in the House of Commons in the federal election of 1962, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Laurier Regnier by 2,601 votes in the federal riding of St. Boniface. He defeated Regnier again in the 1963 election, when the Liberals won a minority government under Lester B. Pearson.\n\nOn April 22, 1963, Roger was appointed Minister of Veterans Affairs by Prime Minister Pearson. At this point Roger became the first self-identifying Métis member of Cabinet.\n\nAs Minister of Veterans Affairs, Roger was involved in some controversial projects. The Royal Canadian Legion was vehemently opposed to any new flag for Canada and Roger was required to be a mediary. He sat on the New Flag Committee as an \"ex officio\" member. He was also involved in the revamping of Canada's veterans' hospitals. In both 1964 and 1966, he represented Canada at war commemorative ceremonies at war cemeteries in Europe. At this time, he toured Canada's war graves. He was dismayed at the condition of the monument at Vimy Ridge. He brought his concern forward but work did not begin on the monument until 1984. Still, it was through Roger's effort that the monument was eventually restored.\n\nRoger saw to it that Vimy Ridge was properly recognized at Vimy Park in Winnipeg, and established a memorial in Halifax dedicated to Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve members who died in the World War II. As a Métis, Roger brought forward the concerns of the Métis in parliament, particularly as they involved the cause that Louis Riel had died for.\n\nRoger was re-elected over Progressive Conservative candidate Harry DeLeeuw in 1965 but, in 1968, he unexpectedly lost the Liberal nomination for St. Boniface to Joseph-Philippe Guay. Choosing not to run in another riding, Roger formally resigned from Cabinet on July 5, 1968.\n\nRoger was then appointed to head the Canada Pension Commission by Prime Minister Trudeau. While still in Cabinet, Roger had been working with this Commission with a view to reforming veterans' pensions. He served on this Commission until his retirement in 1980.\n\nRoger Teillet was married to Jeanne Boux of St. Boniface, Manitoba. They had two sons and there are two grandchildren. Jeanne predeceased him by two years, and their younger son, Richard, died of cancer in 2003. All three are buried in Green Acres Cemetery in St. Boniface. Their eldest son, Philippe Teillet, is a professor emeritus at the University of Lethbridge.\n\nHe died in Ottawa in 2002.\n"}
{"id": "1946424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946424", "title": "Ritual Decalogue", "text": "Ritual Decalogue\n\nThe Ritual Decalogue is a list of laws at . These laws are similar to the Covenant Code and are followed by the phrase \"ten commandments\" ( \"\", in ). Although the phrase \"Ten Commandments\" has traditionally been interpreted as referring to a very different set of laws, in , many scholars believe it instead refers to the Ritual Decalogue found two verses earlier.\n\nCritical biblical scholars understand the two sets of laws to have different authorship.\nEarly scholars, adopting a proposal of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, contrasted the \"Ritual\" Decalogue with the \"Ethical\" Decalogue of and , which are the texts more generally known as the Ten Commandments. Believing that the Bible reflected a shift over time from an emphasis on the ritual to the ethical, they argued that the Ritual Decalogue was composed earlier than the Ethical Decalogue.\nLater scholars have held that they were actually parallel developments, with the Ethical Decalogue a late addition to Exodus copied from Deuteronomy, or that the Ritual Decalogue was the later of the two, a conservative reaction to the secular Ethical Decalogue.\nA few Bible scholars call the verses in Exodus 34 the \"small Covenant code\", as it appears to be a compact version of the Covenant Code in Exodus –; they argue the small Covenant code was composed around the same time as the Decalogue of Exodus 20, but either served different functions within Israelite religion, or reflects the influence of other Ancient Near Eastern religious texts.\n\nThe word \"decalogue\" comes from the Greek name for the Ten Commandments, ('; \"ten terms\"), a translation of the Hebrew (' \"the ten items/terms\").\n\nThe Ritual Decalogue is framed in the context of God making a covenant with Israel:\n\nThis is the only place in the Bible where the phrase \"Ten Commandments\" identifies a set of commandments.\n\nWhile Orthodox Judaism and Christianity hold that both sets contained the same ten commandments, some scholars identify verses 11-26 as an alternate \"ten commandments\" which they call the \"ritual\" decalogue. For these scholars, the terms \"ritual decalogue\" and \"ethical decalogue\" are a way of distinguishing between alternate inscriptions of the ten commandments.\n\nThe commandments in the Ritual Decalogue are expanded upon in the Covenant Code, which occurs prior to it in the Torah, and thus have the impression of being a summary of the important points in the Code. The Covenant Code is believed by most scholars of biblical criticism as having originally been a separate text to the Torah, and thus there is much debate as to the relationship between the Ritual Decalogue and Covenant Code. There are essentially two positions, neither of which is decisively supported, either by evidence, or by number of scholars:\n\n\nThe documentary hypothesis identifies the Ritual Decalogue as the work of the Jahwist, from the Kingdom of Judah, and the Covenant Code as that of the Elohist, from the Kingdom of Israel, both writing independently. It does not however answer the question of how these texts were related, merely that the Ritual Decalogue circulated in Judah, and the Covenant Code in Israel. What the documentary hypothesis does partly explain is the relationship of the Ritual Decalogue to the Ethical Decalogue, and why, instead of the Ethical Decalogue, it is the Ritual Decalogue which is written on the two tablets when Moses ascends the mountain to have the Ethical Decalogue inscribed for a second time.\n\nThe documentary hypothesis claims that the Jahwist and Elohist texts were first combined by a redactor, producing a text referred to simply as JE, in such a way that it now reads that God dictated the Covenant Code, which was written onto stone, Moses subsequently smashing these stones at the incident of the golden calf, and thus having to go back and get a new set, with a set of commandments, the Ritual Decalogue, resembling the first. Under this reconstruction another writer, the Priestly source, later took offence at parts of JE, and rewrote it, dropping the story of the golden calf, and replacing the Ritual Decalogue with a new (ethical) decalogue initially based on it, but taking commandments from elsewhere as well, and replacing the Covenant Code with a vast new law code, placed after the Decalogue for narrative reasons, most of which forms the greater part of the mitzvot in Leviticus.\n\nThe reconstruction then suggests that a century later yet another writer, the Deuteronomist, objected to the Priestly source, and rewrote it yet again, but in a different style: that of a series of flashbacks, producing a second slightly different copy of the Ethical Decalogue, and re-introducing the golden calf. Presented with such divergent versions of the same event, a later redactor is thought to have combined all three versions – JE, the Priestly source, and Deuteronomist, together. JE and the Priestly source were interleaved together, altering JE so that it was now the Ethical Decalogue which was written on the first set of tablets and subsequently destroyed. The alteration, by careful juxtaposition, subtly implied that the second set of tablets also received the Ethical rather than Ritual Decalogue, despite the text saying, immediately after the Ritual Decalogue,\n\nBesides its appearance in , where \"[t]raditionally, it is taken as a reference back to the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20\", the phrase \"\" also appears in , where it is associated with the Ten Commandments of Deuteronomy 5, and in .\n\nSome scholars, calling attention to , \"Then the said: 'I am making a covenant with you',\" note that the laws of Exodus 34 appear to be a shorter and differently organized version of the Covenant Code (). These have been differentiated as the \"Small Covenant Code\" (Exodus 34) and the \"Large Covenant Code\" (Exodus 20–23). These views are not mutually exclusive. Aaron (2006), for example, discusses how the \"Exodus 34 Decalogue\", while presented as the Ten Commandments, appears to be a reworking of the Covenant Code. Indeed, H.L. Ginsberg believed that the Ritual Decalogue was an interpolation, and that the phrase \"Ten Commandments\" in Exodus 34:28 originally referred to a portion of the Covenant Code, , which he called \"the First Ritual Decalogue\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1946432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946432", "title": "Wide Right I", "text": "Wide Right I\n\nWide Right I is the colloquial name for a 1991 college football game between the Miami Hurricanes and Florida State Seminoles. The game is one of the most significant in the history of the Florida State–Miami football rivalry, and its name is a reference to its dramatic ending: With 29 seconds remaining in the game, Florida State kicker Gerry Thomas missed a 34-yard potential game-winning field goal \"wide to the right.\" It was the 26th meeting between the first- and second-ranked teams in the AP Poll and only the second between top-ranked teams from the same state (the other being the 1968 Purdue–Notre Dame game).\n\nMiami's win represented the fourth time in five years that the Hurricanes knocked Florida State out of national championship contention. The game was also the first of a peculiar string of five over the next 12 years in which Florida State lost to Miami due to a late missed field goal that would have won or tied the game, often with national championship implications at stake. Florida State suffered an immediate case of déjà vu when kicker Dan Mowrey missed a field goal wide right on the final play of the 1992 meeting between the schools, a 19–16 Miami win known as \"Wide Right II.\" In later years, two additional \"Wide Rights\" and a \"Wide Left\" ensued.\n\nThe November 16 No. 1 vs. No. 2 showdown between Sunshine State rivals was described as \"the most highly anticipated regular season clash\" since the 1971 Nebraska-Oklahoma game. Top-ranked Florida State entered the game with a 10–0 record and a quarterback, Casey Weldon, who was undefeated as a starter. The Seminoles featured a high-flying offense that was averaging 41 points per game (third in the nation in scoring) and had earlier in the season shocked the college football world by scoring 51 points in a blowout win over the then-No. 4 Michigan Wolverines at Michigan Stadium. Meanwhile, second-ranked Miami had raced to an 8-0 record on the strength of a defense that was ranked first in the nation in scoring and had not allowed a first-half touchdown all season. The Hurricane defense had surrendered just 58 points all season, and Miami carried a 7-game winning streak against top-ranked opponents into the clash. Miami was outscoring its opponents by an average of 28.9 points per game; Florida State, by 25.9. The Seminoles entered with a then-school record 16-game winning streak, while the Hurricanes had won 14 straight. In the struggle between the proverbial unstoppable force and immovable object, host Florida State was installed as the favorite.\n\nThe game occurred before a record crowd of 63,442 at Doak Campbell Stadium. Miami received the ball first and went on an impressive 74-yard opening drive that featured a 30-yard run by running back Stephen McGuire and a critical third-down scramble by quarterback Gino Torretta. McGuire capped the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run to give the Hurricanes the early lead, 7-0. Florida State answered with a 51-yard completion from Weldon to Amp Lee, the longest play Miami's vaunted defense had allowed that season. The play set up a first-and-goal from the Miami 1-yard line. The Hurricane defense stiffened and, after a pair of penalties, Florida State was forced to settle for a 25-yard field goal from Gerry Thomas. The rest of the quarter showed missed opportunities on both sides, with Miami receivers dropping three deep passes from Torretta while Florida State's offense short-circuited with penalties.\n\nMomentum swung to Florida State in the second quarter thanks to three Miami turnovers. The first came early when the Seminole defense recovered a fumble by McGuire at the Hurricane 24-yard line. After Weldon completed a pass to Edgar Bennett to bring the 'Noles down to the 5-yard line, the Hurricane defense again toughened, forcing a fourth-and-goal from the 1. Florida State opted to play smashmouth and backup fullback Paul Moore powered his way into the end zone to give Florida State a 10-7 lead. Miami drove inside the Florida State 30-yard line twice more in the quarter, but Torretta was intercepted each time, first by Terrell Buckley and later by Marvin Jones. Miami got the ball back when Weldon, under pressure from All-American Rusty Medearis (2 sacks for the game), was intercepted by Charles Pharms. The Hurricanes could not convert the turnover into points, as Carlos Huerta's 41-yard field goal attempt was blocked, preserving a 10-7 halftime lead for Florida State.\n\nFlorida State dominated the third quarter statistically, racking up huge advantages in yardage (158 to 38) and time of possession (10:04 to 4:56), but was mostly unable to convert that dominance into points. After briefly getting the wind knocked out of him by Miami linebacker Corwin Francis, Weldon led the 'Noles 58 yards in 13 plays on their first drive of the second half. Florida State drove down to the Miami 9-yard line, but the Miami defense hardened once again and the Seminoles settled for a 31-yard field goal for the only points of the quarter, pushing their lead to 13–7. Later in the third, Florida State embarked on a time-consuming 11-play, 90-yard drive that culminated early in the fourth quarter with Thomas' third field goal of the day, extending the Seminoles' lead to 16–7.\n\nMiami answered with a 10-play, 44-yard drive that ended with a 45-yard field goal by Huerta. Florida State punted on its next possession and Miami took over trailing by 6 with 7 minutes remaining. On second-and-16, Torretta completed a 22-yard pass to an outstretched Coleman Bell, bringing the Hurricanes to the Seminole 41-yard line. A series of runs by McGuire, who finished with 142 yards rushing, brought Miami inside the red zone, but the Hurricanes soon faced a crucial fourth-and-6. Torretta found Horace Copeland for his only reception of the game, giving Miami a first down at the Florida State 3-yard line. The Florida State defense stopped Miami on first and second down, but backup fullback Larry Jones made the end zone on third down from 1 yard out to put the Hurricanes back in front, 17–16, with 3:01 left to play.\n\nFlorida State responded by promptly marching down to the Miami 46-yard line. There, Bennett bulled his way forward for 7 yards to convert a critical fourth-and-1. A pass interference call in the end zone against Miami's Ryan McNeil moved the Seminoles to the 18-yard line. On first down, Lee ran wide to the left side for 1 yard. Out of timeouts, Weldon spiked the ball on second down, bringing up third-and-9 with 29 seconds remaining. Weldon had lost his shoe on the previous play and Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden elected to have Thomas, who was 3-for-3 on the day, attempt a field goal one down early, reasoning, \"An interception, a bounced ball and you lose the ball game. You'd kick yourself in the rear for the rest of your life.\" With both Miami's and Florida State's national championship aspirations riding on the outcome, Thomas came on to attempt a 34-yard, potential game-winning field goal.\n\nKeith Jackson, broadcasting the game for ABC, made the call:\n\nThe snap...it's up...missed it to the right! Miami players are all over the field. They're going to get penalized for it, but \"So what?\" I'm sure is their attitude.\nPrior to the 1991 season, the NCAA narrowed the width of the uprights by 4 feet 10 inches; Thomas' kick missed by the length of the football. Miami players threw their helmets in the air and rushed the field to celebrate, while Bowden, hands on hips, gazed at the goalposts, stunned.\n\nAfter taking a knee to run off the remaining few seconds, Torretta tossed the ball skyward in triumph and Miami emerged from the contest with a 17–16 victory.\n\nAfter the game, Bowden expressed regret about not passing the ball on a third-and-goal from the Hurricane 4-yard line early in the fourth quarter and famously bemoaned his repeated misfortune at the hands of Miami, saying, \"I think the curse is they're on our schedule. They're going to chisel on my tombstone, 'At least he played Miami.'\"\n\nWith the win, Miami ascended to number one in the AP Poll and kept that ranking for the rest of the season. The Hurricanes won their final two regular season games and blanked No. 11 Nebraska 22–0 in the Orange Bowl, en route to their fourth national championship. Miami would share the national championship with the Washington Huskies, who finished first in the Coaches' Poll.\n\nFlorida State was upset in their final regular season game two weeks later by Florida, 14–9. The Seminoles would rebound to beat Texas A&M by a score matching their regular season record, 10–2, in the Cotton Bowl Classic, finishing ranked fourth in both the AP and Coaches' Polls.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1946433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946433", "title": "CAAT box", "text": "CAAT box\n\nIn molecular biology, a CCAAT box (also sometimes abbreviated a CAAT box or CAT box) is a distinct pattern of nucleotides with GGCCAATCT consensus sequence that occur upstream by 60–100 bases to the initial transcription site. The CAAT box signals the binding site for the RNA transcription factor, and is typically accompanied by a conserved consensus sequence. It is an invariant DNA sequence at about minus 70 base pairs from the origin of transcription in many eukaryotic promoters. Genes that have this element seem to require it for the gene to be transcribed in sufficient quantities. It is frequently absent from genes that encode proteins used in virtually all cells. This box along with the GC box is known for binding general transcription factors. Both of these consensus sequences belong to the regulatory promoter. Full gene expression occurs when transcription activator proteins bind to each module within the regulatory promoter. Protein specific binding is required for the CCAAT box activation. These proteins are known as CCAAT box binding proteins/CCAAT box binding factors.\n\nA CCAAT box is a feature frequently found before eukaryote coding regions, but is not found in prokaryotes.\n\nIn the direction of transcription of the template strand, the consensus sequence, or the calculated order of the most frequent residues, for the CAAT box was 3'-TG ATTGG (T/C)(T/C)(A/G)-5'. The use of parentheses denotes that either base is present, but it is not specified as to their relative frequencies. For example, \"(T/C)\" would mean that either thymine or cytosine are preferentially selected for. Within metazoa (animal kingdom), the core binding factor (CBF)-DNA complex retains a high degree of conservation within the CCAAT binding motif, as well as the sequences flanking this pentameric motif. The CCAAT motif in plants (spinach was used in an experiment) differs slightly from metazoa in that it is actually a CAAT binding motif; the promoter lacks one of the two C residues from the pentameric motif, and the artificial addition of the second C has no significant effects on binding activity. Some sequences lack the CAAT-box completely. Secondly, the surrounding nucleotides in plants do not match the consensus sequence above determined by Bi \"et al.\"\n\nThe CAAT box is what is known as a core promoter, also known as the basal promoter or simply the promoter, is a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a particular gene. This region, in particular for the CAAT box, is located about 60–100 bases upstream (towards the 5' end), however no less than 27 base pairs away, from the initial transcription site or a eukaryote gene in which a complex of general transcription factors bind with RNA polymerase II prior to the initiation of transcription. It is essential to the transcription that these core binding factors (also referred to as nuclear factor Y or NF-Y) are able to bind to the CCAAT motif. Experiments in many laboratories have shown that mutations to the CCAAT motif that cause a loss of CBF binding also decreases transcriptional activity in these promoters, suggesting that CBF-CCAAT complexes are essential for optimum transcriptional activity.\n\nIn an experiment done with core binding factors (CBF) and DNA complexes, researchers were able to determine the preferential sequences of the promoter in a region over and immediately adjacent to the CAAT box, and two regions on either side of the CAAT box. By using PCR-mediated random binding selection process, researchers were able to show that the sequence \"3' - (T/C)G ATTGG (T/C)(T/C)(A/G) - 5'\" immediately flanking the ATTGG region (CCAAT in the complementary strand) was preferentially selected on the coding strand (opposite of the template strand). This was shown using an oligonucleotide sequence (R1) which contained 27 random nucleotides, flanked by a defined 20 nucleotide sequence on each side. While no single nucleotide was selected in every clone on either side of the ATTGG motif (CCAAT in the complementary strand), there were several nucleotides in positions selected with high frequency. Most notably from the sequence above was the G residue towards the 5' end of the ATTGG. The other residues also listed were notable, but there is a split between two residues. This same experiment also yielded the same sequence as shown above when using a different oligonucleotide (R2) that contained an ATTGG core and flanked by 12 5' random nucleotides and 10 3' random nucleotides. Both these sequences are very similar and confirmed in multiple experiments. For sequences that flanked the ATTGG motif with two adenine residues (AA) on its 5' end and G(A/G) on its 3' end, seems to have inhibited formation of the CBF-DNA complex and subsequently occurred in only 1% of the promoter sequences. In another experiment performed with the major late promoter (MLP) of adenoviruses from a variety of host species, it was shown that the mutation of the CAAT box and CCAAT sequence, which is thought to play a pivotal role in the (MLP) of subgroup C human adenoviruses, in species with a deficient CAAT sequence. The transcription initiation at mutant MLP species was significantly reduced compared with that of the wild type or species in which there was a CAAT mutant. The failure to restore the normally functional adenoviruses, exhibited by a CAAT box, is consistent with the idea that the CAAT box plays a vital role in the adenovirus MLP and is preferred over other transcriptional elements.\n\nThese core binding factors, or nuclear factors (NF-Y), are composed of three subunits – NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC. Whereas in animals each NF-Y subunit is encoded by a single gene, there has been a diversification in plants in both structure and function. Families of NF-Y consist of between eight and 39 members per subunit. A large reason for this diversification is because of gene duplications and tandem duplications, which have helped contribute to the larger family sizes of NF-Y compared to the single encoded animal nuclear factors. Each subunit contains an evolutionarily conserved part – the C-terminal of NF-YA, the central part of NF-YB, and the N-terminal of NF-YC, greater than 70% of these across species remains conserved. Neighboring regions however are generally not conserved.\n\nThe NF-YA family encodes transcription factors that are variable in length (between 207–347 amino acids for \"M. truncatula\"). The NF-YA proteins are generally characterized by two domains that are strongly conserved in all higher eukaryotes investigated to date. The first domain (A1) contains 20 amino acids that forms an alpha helix that appears significant in its interactions with NF-YB and NF-YC. The second domain (A2) is adjacent to the A1 domain by a conserved linker sequence is a sequence of 21 amino acids vital in the specific DNA to CCAAT box binding. The A1 and A2 domains are conserved towards the C-terminus of mammals, but occupy a more central region in plant NF-YA subunits. In plants, the NF-YA subunit has evolved to regulate the development of a facultative root organ only present in leguminous plants and shown to be expressed in root tissue. It was shown to have drought-resistant-like properties, becoming upregulated during drought stress in the roots and leaves of \"Arabidopsis\". NF-YA mutants have shown a loss of function and a hypersensitivity to drought-like conditions, and contrastly, overexpression of NF-YA has resulted in drought resistance.\n\nThe NF-YB family is, similar to the NF-YA subunit, variable in length, however, on average much smaller than the NF-YA subunit (90–240 amino acids in \"M. truncatula\"). They have been characterized with a structure and amino acid composition similar to the histone fold motif (HFM). This is composed of three alpha-helices separated by two beta strand-loop domains. Similar to NF-YA, NF-YB has been shown to also improve drought resistance when overexpressed and also the promotion of flowering in \"Arabidopsis\".\n\nThe NF-YC proteins are an intermediate size between that of NF-YA and NF-YB proteins (117–292 amino acids in \"M. truncatula\") and also contain the HFM that is prevalent in NF-YB proteins. It has also been shown to be involved in flowering time in certain plants (overexpression leads to earlier flowering) where its influence is potentially regulated by the binding of the protein CONSTANS (CO) to the NF-YC subunit.\n\nBecause of the evolutionary change in NF-Y encoding genes in plants, they subsequently have a large range of potential trimeric complexes. For example, in \"Arabidopsis\", 36 NF-Y transcription factor subunits (including 10 NF-YA, 13 NF-YB, and 13 NF-YC subunits) have been identified and which could theoretically form 1690 unique complexes (which contains one of each type of subunit). This number, of course is higher than what actually happens since some subunits have specific binding patterns. Functional analyses on NF-Y encoding genes in plants have shown, as a result of their evolutionary diversification relative to their animal counterparts, have acquired diverse specific functions, such as embryo development, flowering time control, ER-stress, drought stress, and nodule and root development. This may only be a small portion of their capabilities, since the number of theoretically combinations of NF-Y complexes is so large and only a small portion can actually be created (less than 10% of all possible interactions were confirmed in both directions in yeast).\n\nAnother aspect of the CCAAT binding motif is the CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs). They are a group of transcription factors of 6 members (α-ζ), which are highly conserved and bind to the CCAAT motif. While research on these binding proteins is relatively recent, their function has been shown to have vital roles in cellular proliferation and differentiation, metabolism, inflammation, and immunity in various cells, but specifically hepatocytes, adipocytes, and hematopoietic cells. For example, in adipocytes, this has been shown in a variety of experiments with mice: ectopic expression of these C/EBPs (C/EBPα and C/EBPβ) were able to initiate the differentiation programs of the cell, even in the absence of adipogenic hormones, or the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes (or fat cells). In addition, an overabundance of these C/EBPs (specifically, C/EBPδ) causes an accelerated response. And furthermore, in cells lacking C/EBP or in C/EBP-deficient mice, both are unable to undergo adipogenesis. This results in the mice dying from hypoglycemia, or the reduced lipid accumulation in adipose tissue. The C/EBPs follow a general basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) domain at the C-terminus and are able to form dimers with other C/EBPs or other transcription factors. This dimerization allows the C/EBPs to bind specifically to DNA through a palindromic sequence in the major groove of DNA. They are regulated through various means, including hormones, mitogens, cytokines, nutrients, and other various factors.\n\n"}

Lead singer \"Glam\" wonders whether his relationship is \"real or just a fantasy\", and tells his lover that he is \"Scared of waking up and you'll be gone/Face the truth and I'll be all alone\", a fear that he puts to rest by suggesting that they should \"get into the groove\" and live for the moment.\n\nThe performance was as flamboyant as the music suggested, with the band dressed variously in grey spandex (Glam) and wearing a military hat (Teeny) among other things. Paying tribute to the Orange Revolution which had taken place in host country Ukraine the year before, Glam attached an orange banner to his microphone stand.\n\nAs Norway had not finished the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 in the top ten, the song was performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed thirteenth, following Estonia's Suntribe with \"Let's Get Loud\" and preceding Romania's Luminiţa Anghel & Sistem with \"Let Me Try\". At the close of voting, it had received 164 points, placing 6th in the 25-strong semi-final and qualifying for the final.\n\nIn the final, it was performed fifth, following the Romanian entry and preceding Turkey's Gülseren with \"Rimi Rimi Ley\". At the close of voting, it had received 125 points, placing 9th in a field of 24, guaranteeing Norway a place in the final at the next Contest.\n\nFollowing its success, \"In My Dreams\" became something of a favourite among Contest fans. At the Congratulations special in late 2005, the duo Bobbysocks made reference to the fact that it had broken with the joking tradition that Norway won in years ending with a 5. The duo sang part of the chorus, and the audience responded in kind.\n\nThe song was succeeded as Norwegian representative at the 2006 Contest by Christine Guldbrandsen with \"Alvedansen\".\n\n\"In My Dreams\" was also released as the band's third single and second single for their second studio album Hard to Be a Rock'n Roller, which was reissued after winning Melodi Grand Prix.

Leather, wire, plastic, and nylon are common materials for muzzles. The shape and construction of the muzzle might differ depending on whether the intent is to prevent an animal from biting or from eating, for example.\n\nMuzzles are sometimes used on trained and untrained dogs, large or small, to prevent unwanted biting, scavenging, or wound licking. They can also be used on dogs who display aggression, whether motivated by excitement, fear, or prey drive. Muzzles are also used on dogs when there is a risk of them taking baits that have been laid for vermin.\n\nMuzzles can also be used on racing dogs and working dogs (military, police, security, etc.).\n\nThey are usually made with a strong buckle or other fastening device to ensure that they do not come off accidentally. The most suitable materials for dog muzzles are leather, nylon, plastic and others. The most comfortable muzzles for dogs are those with wire cage construction. Muzzles of this kind give enough freedom for a dog to eat, drink and freely pant. The latter two are of vital importance, especially in hot weather.\n\nDog muzzles can be found in most pet supply stores.\n\nCertain muzzles with a wire-like structure are used on horses and related animals, usually to prevent biting or cribbing. Other types, known as \"grazing muzzles\", have a small opening in the center that allows limited intake of grass, and are used on obese horses or on those animals prone to laminitis or choke, to prevent them from eating too much or too fast.\n\nHorses trained for airscenting, for search and rescue or police work, often are worked in muzzles. This helps to keep them focused on their work, because they cannot easily snatch bites of grass.\n\nHorse muzzles may be purchased in tack shops or from equestrian supply companies, and are available as a halter attachment, or as a separate piece of equipment.\n\nA device under development in England to reduce greenhouse gas emissions aims to capture methane by placing a muzzle on the cow's nose, which converts the methane it burps into carbon dioxide and water.\n\n"}
{"id": "1946443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946443", "title": "Rehabilitation (penology)", "text": "Rehabilitation (penology)\n\nRehabilitation is the process of re-educating and retraining those who commit crime. It generally involves psychological approaches which target the cognitive distortions associated with specific kinds of crime committed by particular offenders - but may also involve more general education such as literacy skills and work training. The goal is to re-integrate offenders back into society. \n\nA successful rehabilitation of a prisoner is also helped if convicted persons:\n\nSee also prisoners' rights.\n\nNorway's prison system is based on the principle of normalization, in which inmates have access to amenities they would have outside of prison, such as an exclusive mini fridge, flat-screen TV, private bathroom, and access to outdoor environment. This, along with a shared kitchen and living area “to create a sense of family” among inmates and the absence of traditional prison uniforms contributes to Norway's rehabilitative normalcy system. The prison's structure is composed of Units A, B and C with Unit A housing those in need of psychiatric or medical attention, thus being the most prohibitive of the three. Halden fengsel, referred to as the “world’s most humane maximum-security prison” embodies the country's goal of reintegration by aiding inmates in sorting out housing and employment before leaving the prison. Rehabilitative measures involve education, job training, workshops to acquire a trade, and therapy along with the humane treatment they receive from personnel who have to complete 3 years of training to become prison guards. The effectiveness of Norway's methods is evident as they hold the lowest recidivism rate worldwide at less than 30%. “Better out than in” is Norway's Correctional Service unofficial motto that is in view with their rehabilitative system as a justice to society by integrating inmates as functioning members of society upon release.\n\nAs established by the Council of Europe committee of ministers, \"a crime policy aimed at crime prevention and the social reintegration of offenders should be pursued and developed\".\n\n\"The European Court of Human Rights, also, has stated in various judgments that, while punishment remains one of the aims of imprisonment, the emphasis in European penal policy is now on the rehabilitative aim of imprisonment, particularly towards the end of a long prison sentence... A prospect of release is necessary, because human dignity requires that there must be a chance for a prisoner to atone for his offence and move towards rehabilitation. A review system is also needed because, over the course of a very long sentence, the balance between the grounds of detention (punishment, deterrence, public protection and rehabilitation) can shift to the point that detention can no longer be justified.\"\n\nPer the , «Everyone has the right to life and to inviolability of his person. The freedom of the individual is inviolable. These rights may only be encroached upon pursuant to a law».\n\nPer the , «Punishment cannot consist in treatment contrary to human dignity and must aim at rehabilitating the condemned».\n\nThe Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 of the UK Parliament enables some criminal convictions to be ignored after a rehabilitation period.\n\nThe United States Code states that sentencing judges shall make imprisonment decisions \"recognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation\".\n\nIn 2015 a number of reformers, including Koch family foundations, the ACLU, the Center for American Progress, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the Coalition for Public Safety, and the MacArthur Foundation, announced a bipartisan resolution to reform the criminal justice system in the United States. Their efforts were lauded by President Obama who noted these reforms will improve rehabilitation and workforce opportunities for those who have served their sentences.\n\nOver the last few decades, the United States prison population has increased significantly. While prisons are considered punishment, they also are intended to have the purpose of future crime prevention. A recent study found that of $74 billion total spent on incarceration among federal, state and local prisons, less than 1% of that was spent on prevention and treatment. Incarceration not only harms the individual as intended, but also has unintended negative effects on the inmate's family, community, and overall society. Inmate education has been shown to reduce recidivism. Evidence shows that inmates overwhelmingly take advantage of education programs if they are available to them and if they can afford them. A recent study showed the earning a GED while incarcerate reduced recidivism rates by 14% for those under 21, and 5% for those over 21. Substance abuse is also a major issue in the prison system. Between 1996 and 2006, despite a modest population increase of 12%, the number of incarcerated individuals rose by 33% and the number of substance-abusing individuals rose by 43%. Existing treatment programs have shown solid evidence that drug treatment programs, along with support after release, are effective at reducing recidivism. Emotional and mental health counseling is a core component of successful inmate rehabilitation. Without the proper innate motivation and desire from the inmate, attempts to educate or assist with substance abuse are less effective. A study revealed that more than half of those incarcerated had a mental health problem, defined as a recent history or symptoms of a mental health problem within the previous 12 months. California's juvenile justice system is based on rehabilitation instead of punishment.\n\nCriminal recidivism is highly correlated with psychopathy. The psychopath is defined by an uninhibited gratification in criminal, sexual, or aggressive impulses and the \"inability to learn from past mistakes\". Individuals with this disorder gain satisfaction through their antisocial behavior and lack remorse for their actions.\n\nFindings indicate psychopathic prisoners have 2.5 times higher probability of being released from jail than undiagnosed ones, even though they are more likely to recidivate.\n\nIt has been shown that punishment and behavior modification techniques do not improve the behavior of a psychopath. Psychopathic individuals have been regularly observed to become more cunning and better able to hide their behaviour. It has been suggested by them that traditional therapeutic approaches actually make psychopaths if not worse, then far more adept at manipulating others and concealing their behavior. They are generally considered to be not only incurable but also untreatable.\n\nPsychopaths also have a markedly distorted sense of the potential consequences of their actions, not only for others, but also for themselves. They do not, for example, deeply recognize the risk of being caught, disbelieved or injured as a result of their behaviour.\n\nSome criticisms of rehabilitative systems are that they can authorize lengthy restrictions of liberty (to allow time for diagnosis and treatment) and broad assumptions of governmental power over offenders' personalities. Moreover, due process concerns can be implicated by a lack of traditional safeguards of defendants' procedural rights in rehabilitative processes. Some rehabilitative programs, such as drug courts, have also been criticized for widening the net of penal control by sentencing more defendants to prison for violations of treatment regimes than would have gone to prison in the absence of those programs.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1946456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946456", "title": "Memorial, Houston", "text": "Memorial, Houston\n\nThe Memorial area of Houston, Texas is located west of Downtown, northwest of Uptown, and south of Spring Branch. The Memorial Super Neighborhood, as defined by the City of Houston, is bounded by Buffalo Bayou to the south, Barker Reservoir to the west, the Katy Freeway (Interstate 10) to the north, and the Memorial Villages (Spring Valley Village, Piney Point Village, Bunker Hill Village, Hedwig Village, Hilshire Village and Hunters Creek Village), a contiguous group of independent municipalities, to the east.\n\nA rich variety of residential architectural styles, particularly mid-century modern, can be found in the affluent forested neighborhoods of Memorial along Buffalo Bayou. The area is also home to a number of major office and retail developments, including Memorial City, Town & Country Village, and CityCentre. A large portion of the Energy Corridor, a large business district heavily populated by energy-related firms, overlaps west Memorial along Eldridge Parkway and the Katy Freeway. Memorial takes its name from Memorial Drive, an east–west arterial road which bisects the area.\n\nPrior to annexation by Houston, the Memorial area consisted of large country estates and farmland. In the mid-1940s, the town of Addicks relocated to the western edge of the area after the construction of Addicks Reservoir by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers inundated the original townsite. This same flood control project, completed in the 1950s, created Barker Reservoir to the west of the area and channelized Buffalo Bayou from State Highway 6 to Beltway 8.\n\nHouston gradually annexed Memorial between the 1950s and 1980s.\n\nRapid growth of the Houston metropolitan area in the 1960s led to the development of a number of subdivisions in the Memorial area, including Nottingham Forest, Westchester, and Fonn Villas. The Memorial Bend subdivision, first developed in 1955, is particularly notable for its large collection of mid-century modern houses. This development was accompanied by the reconstruction of U.S. Route 90 into Interstate 10. Retail development paralleled residential growth; Memorial City Mall was established in 1962, followed by Town & Country Village in 1965.\n\nResidents of Memorial Bend opposed the construction of Texas State Highway Beltway 8 through their neighborhood during the project's planning stages in the early 1960s, but an alternative western route along Dairy Ashford Road was deemed too costly. Funding issues delayed the construction of Beltway 8 through Memorial until the late 1980s.\n\nMemorial continued to gain population between 1980 and 1990.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2003, Memorial City Mall underwent a $600 million renovation. The mall and neighboring Memorial Hermann Memorial City Medical Center now anchor a large mixed-use district featuring multiple office towers, hotels, and apartments. Nearby Town and Country Mall, constructed in the 1980s, was razed in 2005 and replaced with CityCentre, a walkable mixed-use district.\n\nIn August and September 2017, portions of Memorial adjacent to Buffalo Bayou and its tributaries experienced severe flooding from record rainfall associated with Hurricane Harvey. Critical water levels in Addicks Reservoir to the north and Barker Reservoir to the west of the district forced the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to amplify the release of floodwaters downstream into Buffalo Bayou well beyond normal levels, inundating low-lying neighborhoods near Terry Hershey Park and in the Memorial Villages. Controlled reservoir releases and associated flooding were expected to last for up to two weeks after the passage of the storm.\n\nBuffalo Bayou's record-high level throughout Memorial rendered multiple major thoroughfares impassable, including Texas State Highway 6 and portions of Interstate 10; the sunken stretch of the Sam Houston Tollway near CityCentre was submerged for a week, causing significant damage to the roadway. Inundated homes in Memorial were subject to a mandatory evacuation, and the entire area was subject to an emergency curfew even after the expiration of the citywide curfew.\n\nIn the 1990s, Memorial, along with River Oaks and Tanglewood, was described as one of Houston's \"richest, most Republican neighborhoods.\" In the first 1991 Mayor of Houston election, Bob Lanier received more votes than any other candidate in Memorial.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential election, most of the Memorial area, including the Villages, voted for Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHarris County Precinct Three, represented by Steve Radack, includes Memorial.\n\nMemorial is part of Texas Senate Districts 7, 15 and 17, with the largest part in District 7. In the Texas House of Representatives, Memorial is included in Districts 132, 133, 136 and 138.\n\nMemorial is in Texas's 7th congressional district, represented by Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher.\n\nThe United States Postal Service operates the Memorial Park Post Office at near Memorial City, serving ZIP code 77024. Of more recent construction is the Fleetwood Post Office, serving 77079.\n\nIn 2015, the City of Houston-defined Memorial Super Neighborhood had 47,604 residents. 67% were non-Hispanic white, 14% were Hispanic, 11% were non-Hispanic Asian, 5% were non-Hispanic black, and 3% were non-Hispanic other. In 2000 the super neighborhood had 44,957 residents. 78% were non-Hispanic white, 10% were non-Hispanic Asians, 9% were Hispanics, and 2% each were non-Hispanic blacks and others.\n\nMost of Memorial is zoned to Spring Branch Independent School District (SBISD). The Houston Independent School District does not serve residents in Memorial. Students in the western end of the Memorial area attend Katy Independent School District schools. The area is generally known for the high quality of its public schools.\n\nIn 2015, residents of the Katy ISD segments of Thornwood, in the Memorial area, attempted to leave Katy ISD and join Spring Branch ISD, citing long commutes to Katy schools. The Spring Branch ISD board denied their request.\n\nFor pre-kindergarten all residents in Spring Branch ISD are assigned to the Wildcat Way School in Memorial. Zoned elementary schools in the Memorial area in Houston include Meadow Wood, Nottingham, Rummel Creek, Thornwood, Wilchester. In addition, sections are, in separate attendance zones, served by Bunker Hill Elementary School and Frostwood Elementary School in the City of Bunker Hill Village, as well as Memorial Drive Elementary School in City of Piney Point Village. The district also operates Bendwood Elementary School, serving gifted/talented students in the SPIRAL program in grades 3 through 5 as well as utilizing the Preschool Program for Children with Disabilities for special needs students.\n\nMajor middle schools in Memorial include Memorial Middle School and Spring Forest Middle School. In addition, Spring Branch Middle School, in the City of Hedwig Village, serves sections of Memorial.\n\nMemorial High School in Hedwig Village serves the eastern portion of the Memorial area, while Stratford High School in Memorial serves the western portion of the Memorial area. Westchester Academy for International Studies is a Spring Branch ISD district-wide charter magnet school serving grades 6-12.\n\nMemorial Private High School, a private 6-12 school, is located in Memorial near Spring Forest Middle School.\n\nPrivate schools in the surrounding area:\n\nMemorial is served by the Kendall Library of Houston Public Library (HPL), located on Eldridge Parkway, and the Spring Branch Memorial Branch of Harris County Public Library, in Hedwig Village.\n\nOf all HPL branches the Kendall Library received the most severe damage during Hurricane Harvey in 2017; the damage, which affected the electronic system and elevator, but not most of the books as the majority were on the library's second floor, included mold and was so severe that HPL employees re-entered the branch several days after the flood. The total level of water ranged from to . The library afterward enacted a $4 million project post-Harvey renovation program with a tentative 2019 opening.\n\nThe western two-thirds of Memorial is bordered to the south by Terry Hershey Park, a linear park which straddles the Buffalo Bayou between Barker Reservoir and Beltway 8. The park is named for local conservationist Terry Hershey, who founded the Bayou Preservation Association to prevent the Memorial section of the bayou from being lined with concrete. Today, the park is a popular destination for running and bicycling.\n\nOther public parks located within Memorial include Bendwood Park, adjacent to Town and Country Village, and Nottingham Park, near Tully Stadium.\n\nAnother park near Memorial, Houston is Memorial Park. It's near I-10 West and the 610 South Loop. It is named one of the largest urban parks in Texas and in the United States. The park offers a 3-mile running track, tennis courts, a golf course, Smoothie King, and playgrounds. There are also various other trails to take you to lakes, ponds, and other peaceful settings.\n\n\nThe Energy Corridor is an energy industry-oriented business district which overlaps with western Memorial. Within Memorial, the district generally runs parallel to Interstate 10 between Highway 6 and Kirkwood Road, and extends south of Buffalo Bayou along Eldridge Parkway.\n\nThe entire district, which extends westward into Greater Katy, contains over 300 companies which employ 94,000 people. One of the Energy Corridor's largest employers, BP America, is headquartered in the Memorial area at Westlake Park.\n\n Memorial Bend had about 350 houses, with the majority being Mid-Century Modern and ranch houses; many were built in the late 1950s and early 1960s. That year five were recently built and therefore had different designs. The community is near Town & Country Village.\n\nNottingham Forest ( and ) is a group of subdivisions bordered by Memorial Drive to the north and the Buffalo Bayou to the south and west. The neighborhood was one of the first areas of far west Memorial to be developed in the 1960s.\n\nNottingham Forest was the childhood home of comedian Bill Hicks. Hicks jokingly referred to the neighborhood as a \"strict Southern Baptist ozone\".\n\n"}

An army of monsters, led by a powerful warrior named Morticon, swarmed the land with their sights set on taking over the magical realm, the human realm, and beyond. They were opposed by five wizards, who pushed back against the dark forces. The strongest wizard of all, Leanbow, cast a spell and sent the evil warriors into the Underworld, having the Gatekeeper seal the gates for all eternity.

Hillsboro Airport is also a port of entry, with a single-person U.S. Customs and Border Protection office.\n\nHillsboro airport goes back to as early as 1928. Dr. Elmer H. Smith purchased of land near the town to use as an airport, as he owned the first airplane in town. In the early 1930s after Smith died the city purchased the airport for $7,500 and received a federal grant to improve the facilities. They then built two runways, one long and the other at . In July 1936, Richard Evelyn Byrd's \"Stars And Stripes\" Fairchild FC-2 aircraft used to explore the South Pole was displayed at the airport.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II in 1941, the city received federal money again, plus the city approved local financing to improve the airport again, with the costs of the improvements totaling around $600,000. During and after flooding along the Columbia River in 1948 the Hillsboro facility was used by some commercial operators due to the closure of then Portland-Columbia Airport (now Portland International), which lies along the river. The three commercial carriers at Hillsboro were Coastal Airways, Columbia Air Cargo, and General Air Cargo. This was the flooding that wiped out the city of Vanport, and due to that disaster relief supplies were flown into the Portland area by the United States Air Force using the Hillsboro Airport.\n\nThe field was also considered as a possible Naval air station in 1946 and again in 1955, but was eventually rejected by the Navy. In early 1960 several companies were located at the airport including Tektron Instruments and Georgia Pacific. In 1964, the Hillsboro City Council made an official request to the Port of Portland to take over ownership of the airport. The facility had been deteriorated due to inadequate funding, and the Port agreed to take over ownership after some legal wrangling in 1965. Then on August 28, 1966, an air traffic control tower was opened after construction costs of $400,000 with staffing by the FAA. Next in April 1975 the current main terminal that includes offices and a restaurant opened, followed by the opening of the new runway on September 1, 1976.\n\nThe airport received scheduled regular airline service during the late 1970s, on Farwest Airlines to Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, as well as to Medford and North Bend/Coos Bay airports.\n\nIn 1989, customs call out service was added to allow international business flights at the airport after lobbying by Congressman Les AuCoin and business leaders. After advance notice, customs inspectors from Portland would be sent to the airport to process the passengers.\n\nHillsboro airport is often mentioned as a reliever airport for Portland International Airport. In 1999, Portland City Council member Dan Saltzman suggested expanding the Hillsboro Airport to relieve pressure on the busy Portland International Airport. This was during a time when the Port of Portland was discussing building a new larger airport or possibly adding a third runway to PDX to handle growing demand for air travel and air cargo. Saltzman suggested shifting some commercial flights to Hillsboro, while shifting some cargo flights there had previously been discussed.\n\nAs of 2006, the Port of Portland planned to spend $134 million through 2025 to improve the Hillsboro facility. Plans call for a third runway, increased hangar space, and additional automobile parking on-site, among other items. Construction on the third runway was to begin as early as 2010, but legal challenges put the plan on hold. In 2007, a staffed customs office was added to the airport. Paid for by funds generated by a user-fee association, this allowed the airport to continue as a port of entry, and removed the need for a Customs officer to travel from Portland International Airport.\n\nThe airport handled 259,263 flights in 2008, surpassing Portland International in this category. In 2009, the airport received a grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation to expand taxiways as part of the airport's master plan. President Barack Obama landed at the airport in Marine One in February 2011 as part of a visit to nearby Intel. The Port spent $9 million to repave the 2/20 runway and combined two taxiways into a single one in 2013. Construction started on the third runway in June 2014. Nike founder Phil Knight built a personal hangar at the airport next to the Nike hangar in 2014, while Global Aviation added a new hangar that same year. The third runway was eventually built, opening in April 2015.\n\nLocated in Portland's western and Washington County suburbs, Hillsboro Airport is connected to the metropolitan area by TriMet buses and the MAX Blue Line's Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station. The transit station is located to the south of the airport, across the Washington County Fairgrounds. The primary public access point, including to the terminal building, is from Cornell Road, on the south side of the airport.\n\nFacilities include a runway (Rwy 13R/31L), a runway (rwy 2/20), a runway (rwy 13L/31R), and an FAA control tower. Runway 13R/31L is ILS- and PAPI-equipped. The air traffic control tower is staffed from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time. The tower receives a radar feed from the Falls City ARSR to supplement radio communication and binoculars to locate aircraft in its airspace. The small main terminal includes two rental car companies, KUIK-AM radio station, airport offices, and a waiting area for the passengers flying on the daily Intel charter flights. There is also a single-officer-staffed U.S. Customs and Border Protection office to process international flights.\n\nThe airport was originally Hillsboro's municipal airport, which the Port of Portland bought in 1966. It has been developed to support all forms of general aviation and is home to four fixed-base operator (FBOs). Many people, including celebrities, politicians and sports-stars choose to use Hillsboro for its ease and discreetness. The airport is also a hub for many major local corporations, including Nike, Teufel Nursery, and Intel. The predominant activity at the airport is flight training, accounting for more than half of the overall operations. It was formerly the base of operation for the Life Flight Network, the medical evacuation provider for the region. Operated by Oregon Health & Science University, Legacy Health System, and Providence Health System, the non-profit service owns one helicopter and two fixed-wing aircraft.\n\nAs of 2005, the airport handled 223,000 takeoffs and landings. It is Oregon's second-busiest airport overall after Portland International, and is the largest general aviation airport in the state. The annual Oregon International Air Show takes place at Hillsboro Airport.\n\n\nA Horizon Air plane was hijacked on May 2, 1986, en route from Eugene to Portland, with the pilot able to convince the hijacker to allow the plane to land at HIO where the hijacker was arrested.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1946491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946491", "title": "Captain Flint", "text": "Captain Flint\n\nCaptain J. Flint is a fictional 18th-century pirate captain who features in a number of novels, television series, and films. The original character was created by the Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson (1850–1894). Flint first appears in the classic adventure yarn \"Treasure Island\", which was first serialised in a children's magazine in 1881, and later published as a novel in 1883.\n\nCaptain Flint is a fictional character in the book \"Treasure Island\", created by Robert Louis Stevenson in 1883. In Stevenson's book, Flint, whose first name is not given, was the captain of a pirate ship, \"The Walrus\", which accumulated an enormous amount of captured treasure, approximately £700,000. Flint and six members of his crew bury the plunder on an island located somewhere in the Caribbean Sea. Flint then murders his six assistants, leaving the corpse of one, Allardyce, with its arms outstretched in the direction of the buried treasure.\nThe location of the treasure is marked by Flint on a map and entrusted to his first mate William \"Billy\" Bones. It later falls into the hands of the protagonist of the novel, Jim Hawkins.\n\nThe only person Flint was said to fear was his quartermaster John Silver, who later even called his parrot \"Captain Flint\" in mockery.\n\nFlint is said to have died in Savannah, many years before the book's central plot takes place, with his last words being, \"Darby M'Graw - fetch aft the rum...\" His death was said in the book to have been caused by the effects of rum. The inscription on the map suggests that he died in 1754.\n\nFlint has a major part in the 1924 prequel \"Porto Bello Gold\", by A. D. Howden Smith, which depicts the way that the treasure was captured from a Spanish galleon. In this version, Flint is described as having started his piratical career as the junior partner of Andrew Murray, an idealistic Jacobite turned pirate, who is not referenced in Stevenson's original book. Flint gradually becomes the dominant partner. The book describes how Flint secretly buries the treasure which would be recovered a generation later by the protagonists of \"Treasure Island\".\n\nJohn Drake's prequels: \"Flint and Silver\" (2008), \"Pieces of Eight\" (2009), and \"Skull and Bones\" (2010), all heavily feature Captain Flint and give his Christian name as Joseph.\n\nFlint is mentioned in the novel \"Peter and Wendy\" by J. M. Barrie, a friend of Stevenson. The first mention is in a passage introducing Captain Hook's pirate crew: \"Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, the same Bill Jukes who got six dozen on the WALRUS from Flint before he would drop the bag of moidores.\" The second mention is as Hook is attempting to intimidate the Darling children and the Lost Boys, but is heckled by his inner demons: \"'I am the only man whom Barbecue feared,' he urged, 'and Flint feared Barbecue.' 'Barbecue, Flint—what house?' came the cutting retort.\"\n\nIn Arthur Ransome's book \"Swallows and Amazons\", the Blacketts' uncle James Turner is nicknamed Captain Flint by the Walkers. This is because they believed that he looked like a retired pirate and took the name from \"Treasure Island\". He is nearly always referred to by this name in the rest of the books.\n\nIn the movie \"Muppet Treasure Island\", a loose adaptation of the Stevenson story, Captain Flint is shown at the opening burying the said treasure and thereafter killing all the crew who buried it for him. He then returns to sea and gives his map of the place to Billy Bones, who takes it with him. Flint has fifteen crew members to dig the treasure pit in this version, not six, so there is a difference. Also, the treasure itself is guineas and pieces of eight. In the film, he is known as Bernie Flint, as Benjamina Gunn mentions.\n\nCaptain Flint was shown briefly in the animated feature film \"Treasure Planet\" by Disney. In this film, the character was known as Nathaniel Flint, a space pirate of non-human origins whose reputation was legendary for leading his ship and his crew to plunder merchant ships, infamously appearing and disappearing without a trace, and eventually burying his treasure (called by many \"Flint's Trove\" and/or \"the loot of a thousand worlds\") inside the giant alien mechanism known as Treasure Planet.\n\nSet roughly two decades before the events of \"Treasure Island\", the 2014 televised series \"Black Sails\" follows the adventures of Captain Flint and his pirate crew. His first name is given as James in the episode \"VI.\" Episodes \"IX\" and \"XIII\" further reveal that he is a disgraced former Royal Navy lieutenant named James McGraw, dismissed from the service for falling in love and having an affair with Lord Thomas Hamilton. He was exiled from England with Thomas' wife, Miranda Barlow, who has subsequently since hidden herself as a lowly Puritan lady on the trading island of Nassau. Lord Thomas Hamilton was the son of Lord Alfred Hamilton, lord proprietor of the Bahama Islands. McGraw adopted the name \"Flint\" after a mysterious man who boarded his grandfather's ship while at anchor and then disappeared. He is portrayed by Toby Stephens.\n\n"}

Until his death, he was the head of the Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei. He held doctorates in both civil and canon law.\n\nWithin the Roman Curia, the governing body of the Catholic Church, he was a member of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura. He wrote a number of books on spirituality: \"Paths to God: Building a Christian Life in the 21st Century\", \"Para servir a la Iglesia\", \"Getsemaní\", \"Eucaristía y vida cristiana\". He also wrote his reminiscences of St. Josemaria: \"Memoria del beato Josemaría.\"\n\nPope Benedict XVI said on the fiftieth anniversary of Echevarria's ordination in 2005 that his pastoral work \"provides effective help to the Church in her urgent evangelization of present-day society\" and noted the prelate's concern for \"culture and the sciences...the defense of life, the family and marriage, and the formation and pastoral care of young people.\" Pope Francis lauded his \"constant service of love to the Church and souls\", underlining his \"fatherly testimony of priestly and episcopal life\".\n\nEchevarría Rodríguez was born in Madrid, Spain, on 14 June 1932. He began work as the personal secretary of Josemaría Escrivá before being ordained a priest of Opus Dei on 7 August 1955.\n\nIn 1954 Echevarría earned a Doctorate in Canon Law from the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\".\n\nEchevarría was appointed the Secretary General of Opus Dei in 1975, upon the succession of Msgr. Escrivá by Father Álvaro del Portillo as Prelate, or head, of Opus Dei. Echevarría later became Vicar General in 1982, when Opus Dei became, on the Pope's initiative, a personal prelature.\n\nWith the death of Bishop Álvaro del Portillo on 23 March 1994, a period of mourning followed. Echevarría Rodríguez was elected by Opus Dei's General Council as the second Prelate of Opus Dei. He was subsequently confirmed by the Holy See on 20 April 1994, and was then appointed Titular Bishop of \"Cilibia\" by Pope John Paul II on 21 November 1994. He was consecrated a bishop by the pope, with Bishops Giovanni Battista Re and Jorge María Mejía as co-consecrators, on 6 January 1995.\n\nWhen he became prelate he stated that his pastoral priorities were evangelization in the areas of the family, youth and culture. During his term of office, the Opus Dei Prelature began stable formational activities in sixteen countries, including Russia, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. He \"helped steer Opus Dei toward a period of normalization after the controversies surrounding the canonization of Escrivá in 2002 and then the turbulence of the \"Da Vinci Code\".\"\n\nEchevarría Rodríguez served as the chancellor of the University of Navarra in Spain, the University of Asia and the Pacific in the Philippines, and various other universities under the spiritual care of Opus Dei.\n\nHe participated in the General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops for America in 1997 and of Europe in 1999, and also of the General Ordinary Assembly of 2001 and 2005. On Tuesday, 18 September 2012, he was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI to serve as one of the papally-appointed Synod Fathers for the October 2012 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization.\n\nOn 9 July 2005, Pope Benedict XVI greeted Echevarria on the fiftieth anniversary of his ordination, expressing his \"esteem and affection\":\n\nIn 2014, at age 82, he appointed priest Fernando Ocáriz as Auxiliary Vicar, considering an \"increase in the work of government required of the Prelate\", as well as his age. The Auxiliary Vicar is a position to be filled when needed, holding executive authority, foreseen in the statutes of Opus Dei.\n\nOn 5 December 2016 he was admitted to the Campus Bio-Medico University Hospital due to a respiratory infection, where he was treated with antibiotics. On 12 December his condition aggravated leading to a respiratory failure that ultimately caused his death at 21:20 CET.\n\nThe day after Msgr. Echevarría's death, Pope Francis wrote Fr. Ocariz giving condolences to him and all members of Opus Dei, thanking God for his \"constant service of love to the Church and souls\", underlining his \"fatherly testimony of priestly and episcopal life\"\n\nHe wrote works on spirituality such as:\n\n"}
{"id": "1946505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946505", "title": "Focke-Wulf Ta 183", "text": "Focke-Wulf Ta 183\n\nThe Focke-Wulf Ta 183 \"Huckebein\" was a design for a jet-powered fighter aircraft intended as the successor to the Messerschmitt Me 262 and other day fighters in Luftwaffe service during World War II. It was developed only to the extent of wind tunnel models when the war ended, but the basic design was further developed postwar in Argentina as the FMA IAe 33 Pulqui II. The name \"Huckebein\" is a reference to a trouble-making raven (\"Hans Huckebein der Unglücksrabe\") from an illustrated story in 1867 by Wilhelm Busch.\n\nIn early 1944, the Reich Air Ministry (RLM, for \"Reichsluftfahrtministerium\") became aware of Allied jet developments, and were particularly concerned that they might have to face the Gloster Meteor over the continent. In response, they instituted the Emergency Fighter Program which took effect on July 3, 1944, ending production of most bomber and multi-role aircraft in favour of fighters, especially jet fighters. Additionally, they accelerated the development of experimental designs that would guarantee a performance edge over the Allied designs, designs that would replace the first German jet fighters, the Messerschmitt Me 262 \"Schwalbe\" and Heinkel He 162 \"Spatz\".\nThe result was a series of advanced designs, some using swept wings for improved transonic performance, others instead using the tailless design to lower drag to the same end. Since German aircraft engineers were aware that tailless designs might encounter serious stability problems at transonic speeds, much as the prototype Me 163B V18 did on July 6, 1944, in hitting a record 1,130 km/h (702 mph) top speed and nearly destroying its entire rudder surface in the process, a variety of stabilization methods such as airbrakes on the wings were considered for such aircraft or simply adding conventional tail surfaces. Kurt Tank's design team led by Hans Multhopp designed in 1945 a fighter known as \"\"Huckebein\"\" (from Wilhelm Busch's \"\"Hans Huckebein\", the unlucky raven\", a cartoon raven that traditionally makes trouble for others), also known as Project V (Project VI in some references) or Design II at Focke-Wulf. The raven character itself was re-used for the modern Bundeswehr's \"Lufttransportgeschwader 62\" as the inspiration for their unit's insignia.\n\nDevelopment of the Ta 183 started as early as 1942 as Project VI, when the engineer Hans Multhopp assembled a team to design a new fighter, based on his understanding that previous Focke-Wulf design studies for jet fighters had no chance of reaching fruition because none had the potential for transonic speeds. This aircraft, bearing the RLM airframe number 8-183, was intended to use, as with a growing number of other advanced German late-war jet aircraft proposals, the advanced Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet; although the first prototypes were to be powered by the Junkers Jumo 004B. Early studies also included an optional 1,000 kgf (10 kN) thrust rocket engine for takeoff and combat boost, much as the special \"003R\" version of the BMW 003 jet engine was meant to use, with fuel and oxidiser for up to 200 seconds of burn time stored in drop tanks under the wings.\n\nThe wings were swept back at 40° and were mounted in the mid-fuselage position. The wings appear to be mounted very far forward compared with most designs, a side-effect of attempting to keep the centre of pressure (CoP) of the wing as a whole as close to the middle of the fuselage as possible. Reflecting the dilemma of a shortage of strategic materials, the first option of using aluminum in the construction of the main spar consisting of two tapered I-beams attached together on the top and bottom with shear webs of thin steel sheeting, led to a reappraisal. Multhopp chose to use wood instead of metal throughout the wing structure, with wood structure ribs attached to the front and back of the I-beams to give the wing its overall shape, and then covered with plywood. The box-like structure contained six fuel cells, giving the aircraft a total fuel load of 1,565 l (413 US gal).\n\nThe original design used a T-tail, with a notably long vertical stabilizer and a seemingly undersized horizontal stabilizer. The vertical stabilizer was swept back at 60°, and the horizontal stabilizer was swept back and slightly dihedralled. The horizontal stabilizer also featured two large trim tabs, the main pitching force actually being provided by what would have appeared to be \"ailerons\" on most other turbojet-powered fighter airframes of the period. The Ta 183 wing's outermost trailing-edge control surfaces on its wing panels, were well behind the center of gravity, placing their trailing edges' tips virtually even, horizontally, with the intended HeS 011 jet engine's exhaust orifice, and thus could provide both pitch and roll control through functioning as elevon control surfaces, as those on the wing panels of Messerschmittt's Me 163 tailplane-less \"Komet\" rocket fighter already did. Many problems beset the project, including the chance of a Dutch roll. Work therefore concentrated on the much less problematic Focke-Wulf Project VII. However, when the RLM eventually rejected that design, \"Huckebein\" was again brought to the fore.\n\nThe Ta 183 had a short fuselage with the air intake passing under the cockpit and proceeding to the rear where the single engine was located. The pilot sat in a pressurized cockpit with a bubble canopy which provided excellent vision. The primary armament of the aircraft consisted of four 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannons arranged around the air intake.\n\nIt was also possible to carry a bomb load of 500 kg (1,100 lb), consisting of one SD or more SC 500 half-tonne bombs, one \"Bombentorpedo\" BT 200 bomb, five SD-series fragmentation bombs, SC-series general-purpose bombs, or a Rb 20/30 reconnaissance camera. The weapons load would be carried in the equipment space in the bottom of the fuselage and thus partially protrude about halfway from the fuselage, possibly allowing for other armament packages such as the Ruhrstahl X-4 wire-guided missile.\n\nMulthopp's team also seriously explored a second version of the basic design, known as Design III, a modified Design II (it is unknown what Design I referred to). The first of these had only minor modifications, with slightly differently shaped wingtips and repositioning of the undercarriage. The second version had a reduced sweepback to 32°, allowing the wing and cockpit to be moved rearward. The tail was also redesigned, using a short horizontal boom to mount the control surfaces just above the line of the rear fuselage. This version looks considerably more \"conventional\" to the modern eye, although somewhat stubby due to the short overall length of the HeS 011.\n\nThe second of these two schemes was entered in the official competition ordered by the \"Oberkommando der Luftwaffe\" at the end of 1944. On 28 February 1945, the Luftwaffe High Command examined the various Emergency Fighter proposals and selected the Junkers EF 128 to be developed and produced; the Focke-Wulf team gained second place. However, in the last few weeks of the war, it was decided that the \"Huckebein\" was really the best design and, at a meeting in Bad Eilsen, Tank was told to arrange mockups and to plan for full production. It had a planned speed of about 1,000 km/h (620 mph) at 7,000 m (22,970 ft) and it was estimated that 300 aircraft per month would be delivered when production got into its stride, each aircraft being produced in 2,500 man hours.\n\nA total of 16 prototypes were to be built, allowing the tail unit to be interchanged between the Design II and III variations. Of the \"Versuchs\" (experimental test series) aircraft, the Ta 183 V1-V3 were to be powered by the Jumo 004B turbojet with somewhat lengthened rear fuselages near the engine's exhaust nozzle to accommodate them, pending delivery of the HeS 011 jet engine. The Ta 183 V4-V14 were intended to be A-0 series pre-production aircraft and V15-V16 were to be static test aircraft. The first flight of the aircraft was projected for May 1945, but no finished Ta 183 \"Versuchs\"-series prototypes had been completed by 8 April 1945, when British troops captured the Focke-Wulf facilities.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Kurt Tank, in exile in Argentina, resurrected the Ta 183 project, resulting in the IAe Pulqui II. This version was modified to place the wings at a shoulder-mounted position, in order to avoid a heavy fuselage spar pass-through structure going around the engine, however this resulted in deep stall problems at high angles of attack. This could be resolved, and a version correcting these problems was planned. However, the financial crash of 1953 and the fall of Juan Peron temporarily suspended work on the project. By 1955, the project had been abandoned due to the availability of cheap surplus ex-Korean War F-86 Sabres at a fraction of the cost.\nHistorians including David Myrha have claimed the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 was at least inspired by the Ta 183, because the Soviets captured plans from the Germans at the end of World War II. The MiG-15 does bear a resemblance in layout, sharing the high tailplane and nose-mounted intake, although the aircraft are different in structure, details, and proportions. The MiG-15's design shared features, and some appearance commonalities with the MiG design bureau's own 1945-46 attempt at a Soviet-built version of the Messerschmitt Me 263 rocket fighter, and also common to many contemporary jet fighters — and were derived from aerodynamic and structural considerations (for example, the American Republic F-84F, the Swedish SAAB 29, and the French Dassault Ouragan and Mystère). A detailed design history of the MiG-15 was published by Russian aviation historian Yefim Gordon refuting any connection between the Ta 183 and the MiG-15. According to the designers, the MiG-15 was an indigenous design, their choice of swept wings (as swept-back wings of any sort on a Soviet-designed aircraft were first flown on the MiG-8 \"Utka\" canard light aircraft of 1945) being due to their desire to move ahead of most Western designs which were not intended for the 960 km/h+ (600 mph+) speed range.\n\nLike the MiG-9 and MiG-15, the Saab 29 is subject to claims of having been indirectly influenced by the Ta 183. SAAB engineers received German research studies in swept wings in the immediate post-war period via contacts in Switzerland, and incorporated it into the Tunnan design, which was still limited to paper studies at the time.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

It ranges from the traditional or conventional modes of military power, the causes and consequences of war between states, economic strength, to ethnic, religious and ideological conflicts, trade and economic conflicts, energy supplies, science and technology, food, as well as threats to human security and the stability of states from environmental degradation, infectious diseases, climate change and the activities of non-state actors.\n\nWhile the wide perspective of international security regards everything as a security matter, the traditional approach focuses mainly or exclusively on military concerns.\n\nEdward Kolodziej has compared international security to a Tower of Babel and Roland Paris (2004) views it as \"in the eye of the beholder\". Security has been widely applied to \"justify suspending civil liberties, making war, and massively reallocating resources during the last fifty years\".\n\nWalter Lippmann (1944) views security as the capability of a country to protect its core values, both in terms that a state need not sacrifice core values in avoiding war and can maintain them by winning war. David Baldwin (1997) argues that pursuing security sometimes requires sacrificing other values, including marginal values and prime values. Richard Ullman (1983) has suggested that a decrease in vulnerability is security.\n\nArnold Wolfers (1952) argues that \"security\" is generally a normative term. It is applied by nations \"in order to be either expedient—a rational means toward an accepted end—or moral, the best or least evil course of action\". In the same way that people are different in sensing and identifying danger and threats, Wolfers argues that different nations also have different expectations of security. Not only is there a difference between forbearance of threats, but different nations also face different levels of threats because of their unique geographical, economic, ecological, and political environment.\n\nBarry Buzan (2000) views the study of international security as more than a study of threats, but also a study of which threats that can be tolerated and which require immediate action. He sees the concept of security as not either power or peace, but something in between.\n\nThe concept of an international security actor has extended in all directions since the 1990s, from nations to groups, individuals, international systems, NGOs, and local governments.\n\nTraditional approaches to international security usually focus on state actors and their military capacities to protect national security. However, over the last decades the definition of security has been extended to cope with the 21st century globalized international community, its rapid technological developments and global threats that emerged from this process. One such comprehensive definition has been proposed by Nayef Al-Rodhan. What he calls the \"Multi-sum security principle\" is based on the assumption that \"in a globalized world, security can no longer be thought of as a zero-sum game involving states alone. Global security, instead, has five dimensions that include human, environmental, national, transnational, and transcultural security, and therefore, global security and the security of any state or culture cannot be achieved without good governance at all levels that guarantees security through justice for all individuals, states, and cultures.\"\n\nEach of these five dimensions refers to a different set of substrates. The first dimension refers to human security, a concept that makes the principle referent object of security the individual, not the state. The second dimension is environmental security and includes issues like climate change, global warming, and access to resources. The third substrate refers to national security, defined as being linked to the state's monopoly over use of force in a given territory and as a substrate of security that emphasizes the military and policing components of security. The fourth component deals with transnational threats such as organized crime, terrorism, and human trafficking. Finally, the integrity of diverse cultures and civilisational forms tackles the issue of transcultural security. According to this multi-faceted security framework all five dimensions of security need to be addressed in order to provide \"just\" and \"sustainable\" global security. It therefore advocates cooperative interaction between states and peaceful existence between cultural groups and civilizations.\n\nThe traditional security paradigm refers to a realist construct of security in which the referent object of security is the state. The prevalence of this theorem reached a peak during the Cold War. For almost half a century, major world powers entrusted the security of their nation to a balance of power among states. In this sense international stability relied on the premise that if state security is maintained, then the security of citizens will necessarily follow. Traditional security relied on the anarchistic balance of power, a military build-up between the United States and the Soviet Union (the two superpowers), and on the absolute sovereignty of the nation state. States were deemed to be rational entities, national interests and policy driven by the desire for absolute power. Security was seen as protection from invasion; executed during proxy conflicts using technical and military capabilities.\n\nAs Cold War tensions receded, it became clear that the security of citizens was threatened by hardships arising from internal state activities as well as external aggressors. Civil wars were increasingly common and compounded existing poverty, disease, hunger, violence and human rights abuses. Traditional security policies had effectively masked these underlying basic human needs in the face of state security. Through neglect of its constituents, nation states had failed in their primary objective.\n\nIn the historical debate on how best to achieve national security, writers like Hobbes, Macchiavelli, and Rousseau tended to paint a rather pessimistic picture of the implications of state sovereignty. The international system was viewed as a rather brutal arena in which states would seek to achieve their own security at the expense of their neighbors. Inter-state relations were seen as a struggle for power, as states constantly attempted to take advantage of each other. According to this view, permanent peace was unlikely to be achieved. All that states could do was to try to balance the power of other states to prevent any one from achieving overall hegemony. This view was shared by writers such as E.H. Carr and Hans Morgenthau.\n\nMore recently, the traditional state-centric notion of security has been challenged by more holistic approaches to security. Among the approaches which seeks to acknowledge and address these basic threats to human safety are paradigms that include cooperative, comprehensive and collective measures, aimed to ensure security for the individual and, as a result, for the state.\n\nTo enhance international security against potential threats caused by terrorism and organized crime, there have been an increase in international cooperation, resulting in transnational policing. The international police Interpol shares information across international borders and this cooperation has been greatly enhanced by the arrival of the Internet and the ability to instantly transfer documents, films and photographs worldwide.\n\nIn the field of international relations, realism has long been a dominant theory, from ancient military theories and writings of Chinese and Greek thinkers, Sun Tzu and Thucydides being two of the more notable, to Hobbes, Machiavelli and Rousseau. It is the foundation of contemporary international security studies. The twentieth century classical realism is mainly derived from Edward Hallett Carr's book \"The Twenty Years' Crisis\". The realist views anarchy and the absence of a power to regulate the interactions between states as the distinctive characteristics of international politics. Because of anarchy, or a constant state of antagonism, the international system differs from the domestic system. Realism has a variety of sub-schools whose lines of thought are based on three core assumptions: groupism, egoism, and power-centrism. According to classical realists, bad things happen because the people who make foreign policy are sometimes bad.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, with increasing criticism of realism, Kenneth Waltz tried to revive the traditional realist theory by translating some core realist ideas into a deductive, top-down theoretical framework that eventually came to be called neorealism. \"Theory of International Politics\" brought together and clarified many earlier realist ideas about how the features of the overall system of states affects the way states interact:\n\nThe main theories of neorealism are balance of power theory, balance of threat theory, security dilemma theory, offense-defense theory, hegemonic stability theory and power transition theory.\n\nLiberalism has a shorter history than realism but has been a prominent theory since World War I. It is a concept with a variety of meanings. Liberal thinking dates back to philosophers such as Thomas Paine and Immanuel Kant, who argued that republican constitutions produce peace. Kant's concept of Perpetual Peace is arguably seen as the starting point of contemporary liberal thought.\n\nEconomic liberalism assumes that economic openness and interdependence between countries makes them more peaceful than countries who are isolated. Eric Gartzke has written that economic freedom is 50 times more effective than democracy in creating peace. Globalization has been important to economic liberalism.\n\nLiberal institutionalism views international institutions as the main factor to avoid conflicts between nations. Liberal institutionalists argue that; although the anarchic system presupposed by realists cannot be made to disappear by institutions; the international environment that is constructed can influence the behavior of states within the system. Varieties of international governmental organizations (IGOs) and international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) are seen as contributors to world peace.\n\nSome believe that these international institutions lead to neotrusteeship, or postmodern imperialism. International institutions lead to an interconnectedness between strong and weak or post-conflict nations. In a situation such as a collapsed, weak-nation without the means of autonomous recovery, international institutions often lead to involvement by a stronger nation to aid in recovery. Because there is no definite international security policy to address weak or post-conflict nations, stronger nations sometimes face “mission-creep,” a shift from supplying and aiding nations to an escalation of mission goals, when aiding weaker nations. In addition, there is some debate due to lack of testing that international intervention is not the best institution to aid weak or post-war nations. Possible mission-creep, as well as inefficiencies in international intervention, creates debate as to the effectiveness of international institutions in peacekeeping.\n\nSince its founding in the 1980s, constructivism has become an influential approach in international security studies. \"It is less a theory of international relations or security, however, than a broader social theory which then informs how we might approach the study of security.\" Constructivists argue that security is a social construction. They emphasize the importance of social, cultural and historical factors, which leads to different actors construing similar events differently.\n\nAs stated previously on this page, international and national security are inherently linked. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been prominent in highlighting the importance of women in national and thus international security. In what has been referred to as \"the Hillary Doctrine\", she highlights the adversarial relationship between extremism and women's liberation in making the point that with women's freedom comes the liberation of whole societies. As states like Egypt and Pakistan grant more rights to women, further liberation and stability within such countries will inevitably ensue, fostering greater security throughout the international realm. Along the same lines, Secretary of State John Kerry stated that \"no country can get ahead if it leaves half of its people behind. This is why the United States believes gender equality is critical to our shared goals of prosperity, stability, and peace, and why investing in women and girls worldwide is critical to advancing US foreign policy\". Elevating women to equal standing internationally will help achieve greater peace and security. This can be seen in both developmental and economic factors, as just two examples among many. Built into American foreign policy is the idea that empowering women leads to greater international development due to their increased ability to maintain \"the well-being of their families and communities, drive social progress, and stabilize societies.\" Female empowerment through economic investment, such as supporting their participation in the workforce, allows women to sustain their families and contribute to overall economic growth in their communities. Such principles must be propagated nationally and globally in order to increase the agency of women to achieve the necessary gender equality for international security.\n\nThere is much consideration within feminist international relations (IR) surrounding the importance of female presence to international security. The inclusion of women in discussions surrounding international cooperation increases the likelihood of new questions being asked that may not be given consideration in an otherwise masculine-dominated environment. As a renowned theorist within Feminist IR, J. Ann Tickner points out questions that women would likely be more inclined to ask in regards to war and peace. For example, why men have been the predominant actors in combat, how gender hierarchies contribute to the legitimation of war, and the consequences of associating women with peace. In general, the main issue of concern to feminists within IR is why in political, social, and economic realms, femininity remains inferior to masculinity, as they see the effects of this transcendental hierarchy both nationally and internationally. Such considerations contribute significant perspective to the role that women play in maintaining peaceful conditions of international security.\n\nDespite acknowledgment of the importance of recognizing women's role in maintaining international security by Clinton, Kerry, and conceivably many others, the fact remains that women are disproportionately presented as victims, rather than actors or leaders. This can be derived by looking at information and statistics presented in Joni Seager's book \"The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World\". For example, in combat zones, women face heightened risks of sexual assault, and their familial responsibilities are complicated by reduced access to necessary resources. In terms of governmental presence, (to support their role as leaders), women have not yet achieved equal representation in any state, and very few countries have legislative bodies that are more than 25% female. While prominent female politicians are becoming more frequent, \"women leaders around the world like those who become presidents or prime ministers or foreign ministers or heads of corporations cannot be seen as tokens that give everyone else in society the change to say we've taken care of our women\". This statement by Clinton reiterates the necessity to confront such on-going challenges to female participation, making such issues pertinent to international security.\n\n\nHuman security derives from the traditional concept of security from military threats to the safety of people and communities. It is an extension of mere existence (survival) to well-being and dignity of human beings. Human security is an emerging school of thought about the practice of international security. Under The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Commission on Human Security (CHS), in its final report, Human Security Now defines human security as “…to protect the vital core of all human lives in ways that enhance human freedoms and human fulfillment.\" Critics of the concept of human security claim that it covers almost everything and that it is too broad to be the focus of research. There have also been criticisms of its challenge to the role of states and their sovereignty. The challenge continues with the debate between responsible to protect from the international community verses the sovereignty of each state. \n\nHuman security offers a critique of and advocates an alternative to the traditional state-based conception of security. Essentially, it argues that the proper referent for security is the individual and that state practices should reflect this rather than primarily focusing on securing borders through unilateral military action. The justification for the human security approach is said to be that the traditional conception of security is no longer appropriate or effective in the highly interconnected and interdependent modern world in which global threats such as poverty, environmental degradation, and terrorism supersede the traditional security threats of interstate attack and warfare. Further, state-interest-based arguments for human security propose that the international system is too interconnected for the state to maintain an isolationist international policy. Therefore, it argues that a state can best maintain its security and the security of its citizens by ensuring the security of others. It is need to be noted that without the traditional security no human security can be assured.\n\nHuman security is more aligned with non-traditional threats of international security. Compared to the traditional security issues, human security \"has been related more to nation-states than to people.\" Thus, the emphasis on security transitions from territorial security between states to the individual people's security. The two main components includes freedom from fear and freedom from want. The list of human security threats is broad, but can be narrowed under seven main categories: economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security, and political security. Some examples include human trafficking, disease, environmental and natural disasters, degradation, poverty, and more. \n\nThe 1994 UNDP Human Development Report (HDR) proposes that increasing human security entails:\n\nThe report elaborates on seven components to human security. Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy list them as follows:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1946569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946569", "title": "Valentinianism", "text": "Valentinianism\n\nValentinianism was one of the major Gnostic Christian movements. Founded by Valentinus in the second century AD, its influence spread widely, not just within Rome, but also from Northwest Africa to Egypt through to Asia Minor and Syria in the east.\n\nLater in the movement's history it broke into an Eastern and a Western school. Disciples of Valentinus continued to be active into the 4th century AD, after the Roman Empire was declared to be Christian.\n\nThe doctrine, practices and beliefs of Valentinus and the Gnostic movement that bore his name were condemned as heretical by proto-orthodox church leaders and scholars. Prominent Church Fathers such as Irenaeus of Lyons and Hippolytus of Rome wrote against Gnosticism. Because early church leaders encouraged the destruction of Gnostic texts, most evidence for the Valentinian theory comes from its critics and detractors, most notably Irenaeus, since he was especially concerned with refuting Valentinianism.\n\nValentinus was born in approximately 100 AD and died in Alexandria circa 180 AD. According to the Christian scholar Epiphanius of Salamis, he was born in Egypt and schooled in Alexandria, where the Gnostic Basilides was teaching. However Clement of Alexandria (c.150c.215), another Christian scholar and teacher, reports that Valentinus was taught by Theudas, a disciple of the apostle Paul. He was reputed to be an extremely eloquent man who possessed a great deal of charisma and had an innate ability to attract people. He went to Rome some time between AD 136 and 140, in the time of Pope Hyginus, and had risen to the peak of his teaching career between AD 150 and 155, during the time of Pius.\n\nValentinus is said to have been a very successful teacher, and for some time in the mid-2nd century he was even a prominent and well-respected member of the Catholic community in Rome. At one point during his career he had even hoped to attain the office of bishop, and apparently it was after he was passed over for the position that he broke from the Catholic Church. Valentinus was said to have been a prolific writer; however, the only surviving remains of his work come from quotes that have been transmitted by Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus and Marcellus of Ancyra. Most scholars also believe that Valentinus wrote the Gospel of Truth, one of the Nag Hammadi texts.\n\nNotable Valentinians included Heracleon (fl. ca. 175), Ptolemy, Florinus, Axionicus and Theodotus.\n\nThe theology that Irenaeus attributed to Valentinus is extremely complicated and difficult to follow. There is some skepticism among scholars that the system actually originated with him, and many believe that the system Irenaeus was counteracting was the construct of later Valentinians.\n\nAccording to Irenaeus, the Valentinians believed that at the beginning there was a Pleroma (literally, a 'fullness'). At the centre of the Pleroma was the primal Father or \"Bythos\", the beginning of all things who, after ages of silence and contemplation, projected thirty \"Aeons\", heavenly archetypes representing fifteen syzygies or sexually complementary pairs. Among them was \"Sophia\". Sophia's weakness, curiosity and passion led to her fall from the Pleroma and the creation of the world and man, both of which are flawed. Valentinians identified the God of the Old Testament as the Demiurge, the imperfect creator of the material world. Man, the highest being in this material world, participates in both the spiritual and the material nature. The work of redemption consists in freeing the former from the latter. One needed to recognize the Father, the \"depth of all being\", as the true source of divine power in order to achieve \"gnosis\" (knowledge). The Valentinians believed that the attainment of this knowledge by the human individual had positive consequences within the universal order and contributed to restoring that order, and that gnosis, not faith, was the key to salvation. Clement wrote that the Valentinians regarded Catholic Christians \"as simple people to whom they attributed faith, while they think that gnosis is in themselves. Through the excellent seed that is to be found in them, they are by nature redeemed, and their gnosis is as far removed from faith as the spiritual from the physical\".\n\nThe superstructure of the celestial system, the celestial world of Aeons, is here developed in the most complicated way. These Aeons belong to the purely ideal, noumenal, intelligible, or supersensible world; they are immaterial, they are hypostatic ideas. Together with the source from which they emanate they form the Pleroma. The transition from the immaterial to the material, from the noumenal to the sensible, is brought about by a flaw, or a passion, or a sin, in the female Aeon Sophia.\n\nEpiphanius alleges that the Valentinians \"set forth their thirty aeons in mythologic fashion, thinking that they conformed to the years of Jesus\". Of the eight celestial beings of the \"Ogdoad,\" four are peculiar to the Valentinian system. The third pair of Aeons, \"Logos\" and \"Zoe,\" occur only here, and the place of this pair is not firmly established, and occur sometimes before and sometimes after the fourth pair of Aeons, the \"Anthropos\" and the \"Ekklesia\". We cannot be far wrong in suspecting that Valentinus was influenced by the prologue of the fourth Gospel (we also find the probably Johannine names \"Monogenes\" and \"Parakletos\" in the series of Aeons).\n\nIn Valentinianism, Sophia always stands absolutely at the center of the system, and in some sense she seems to represent the supreme female principle.\n\nSophia is the youngest of the Aeons. Observing the multitude of Aeons and the power of begetting them, she hurries back into the depth of the Father, and seeks to emulate him by producing offspring without conjugal intercourse, but only projects an abortion, a formless substance. Upon this she is cast out of Pleroma and into the primal sub-stratum of matter. In the Valentinian systems, the fall of Sophia appears in double guise. The higher Sophia still remains within the upper world after creating a disturbance, and after her expiation and repentance; but her premature offspring, \"Sophia Achamoth\", is removed from the Pleroma, and becomes the heroine of the rest of the drama. This fallen Sophia becomes a world creative power.\nSophia Achamoth, or \"Lower Wisdom\", the daughter of \"Higher Wisdom\", becomes the mother of the Demiurge, identified with the God of the Old Testament. \n\nThe Gnostics are children of Sophia; from her the heavenly seed, the divine spark, descended into this lower world, subject to the \"Heimarmene\" (destiny) and in the power of hostile spirits and powers; and all their sacraments and mysteries, their formulae and symbols, must be in order to find the way upwards, back to the highest heaven. This idea that the Gnostics know themselves to be in a hostile and evil world reacted in the same direction upon the conception of Sophia. She became likewise a fallen Aeon, who has sunk down into the material world and seeks to free herself from it, receiving her liberation at the hands of a heavenly Redeemer, exactly like the Gnostics.\n\nThe goddess who sinks down into the material may readily be identified with \"Ruach\" (רוח), the Spirit of God, who broods over Chaos, or even with the later \"Chokhmah\", who was generally conceived of as a world-creating agent.\n\nThis system was very closely followed by Valentinus, who may have come to know these doctrines in Egypt. Irenaeus characterizes the Gnostics as the \"pneumatici\" who have a perfect knowledge of God, and have been initiated into the mysteries of Achamoth.\n\nThe chief influence at work here seems to have been the idea of the celestial \"Anthropos\" (\"i.e.\" the Primal Man) – of whom the myth originally relates that he has sunk into matter and then raised himself up from it again – which appears in its simple form in individual Gnostic systems, \"e.g.\" in Poimandres (in the \"Corpus Hermeticum\") and in Manichaeism.\n\nAccording to Valentinus, the Anthropos no longer appears as the world-creative power sinking down into the material world, but as a celestial Aeon of the upper world (or even as the supreme god), who stands in a clearly defined relationship to the fallen Aeon. Adam was created in the name of Anthropos, and overawes the demons by the fear of the pre-existent man. This Anthropos is a cosmogonic element, pure mind as distinct from matter, mind conceived hypostatically as emanating from God and not yet darkened by contact with matter. This mind is considered as the reason of humanity, or humanity itself, as a personified idea, a category without corporeality, the human reason conceived as the World-Soul. It is possible that the role of the Anthropos is here transferred to Sophia Achamoth.\n\nIt is also clear why the Ekklesia appears together with the Anthropos. With this is associated the community of the faithful and the redeemed, who are to share the same fate with him. Perfect \"gnosis\" (and thus the whole body of Gnostics) is connected with the Anthropos.\n\nNext to Sophia stands a male redeeming divinity. In the true Valentinian system, the Christ is the son of the fallen Sophia, who is thus conceived as an individual. Sophia conceives a passion for the First Father himself, or rather, under pretext of love she seeks to draw near to the unattainable Bythos, the Unknowable, and to comprehend his greatness. She brings forth, through her longing for that higher being, an Aeon who is higher and purer than herself, and at once rises into the celestial worlds. Christ has pity on the abortive substance born of Sophia and gives it essence and form, whereupon Sophia tries to rise again to the Father, but in vain. In the enigmatic figure of Christ we again find hidden the original conception of the Primal Man, who sinks down into matter but rises again.\n\nIn the fully developed Ptolemaean system we find a kindred conception, but with a slight difference. Here Christ and Sophia appear as brother and sister, with Christ representing the higher and Sophia the lower element. When this world has been born from Sophia in consequence of her passion, two Aeons, Nous (mind) and Aletheia (truth), by command of the Father, produce two new Aeons, Christ and the Holy Ghost; these restore order in the Pleroma, and in consequence all Aeons combine their best and most wonderful qualities to produce a new Aeon (Jesus, Logos, Soter, or Christ), the \"First Fruits\" whom they offer to the Father. And this celestial redeemer-Aeon now enters into a marriage with the fallen Aeon; they are the \"bride and bridegroom\". It is boldly stated in the exposition in Hippolytus' \"Philosophumena\" that they produce between them 70 celestial angels.\n\nThis myth can be connected with the historic Jesus of Nazareth by further relating that Christ, having been united to the Sophia, descends into the earthly Jesus, the son of Mary, at his baptism, and becomes the Saviour of men.\n\nA figure entirely peculiar to Valentinian Gnosticism is that of \"Horos\" (the Limiter). The name is perhaps an echo of the Egyptian Horus.\n\nThe task of Horos is to separate the fallen Aeons from the upper world of Aeons. At the same time he becomes a kind of world-creative power, who in this capacity helps to construct an ordered world out of Sophia and her passions. He is also called Stauros (cross), and we frequently meet with references to the figure of Stauros. Speculations about the Stauros are older than Christianity, and a Platonic conception may have been at work here. Plato had already stated that the World-Soul revealed itself in the form of the letter Chi (X), by which he meant that figure described in the heavens by the intersecting orbits of the sun and the planetary ecliptic. Since through this double orbit all the movements of the heavenly powers are determined, so all \"becoming\" and all life depend on it, and thus we can understand the statement that the World-Soul appears in the form of an X, or a cross.\n\nThe cross can also stand for the wondrous Aeon on whom depends the ordering and life of the world, and thus Horos-Stauros appears here as the first redeemer of Sophia from her passions, and as the orderer of the creation of the world which now begins. Naturally, then, the figure of Horos-Stauros was often assimilated to that of the Christian Redeemer. We possibly find echoes of this in the \"Gospel of Peter\", where the Cross itself is depicted as speaking and even floating out of the tomb.\n\nPeculiarly Valentinian is the above-mentioned derivation of the material world from the passions of Sophia. Whether this already formed part of the original system of Valentinus is questionable, but at any rate it plays a prominent part in the Valentinian school, and consequently appears with the most diverse variations in the account given by Irenaeus. By it is effected the comparative monism of the Valentinian system, and the dualism of the conception of two separate worlds of light and darkness is overcome:\nThis derivation of the material world from the passions of the fallen Sophia is next affected by an older theory, which probably occupied an important place in the main Valentinian system. According to this theory the son of Sophia, whom she forms on the model of the Christ who has disappeared in the Pleroma, becomes the Demiurge, who with his angels now appears as the real-world creative power.\n\nAccording to the older conception, he was an evil and malicious offspring of his mother, who has already been deprived of any particle of light. In the Valentinian systems, the Demiurge was the offspring of a union of Sophia Achamoth with matter, and appears as the fruit of Sophia's repentance and conversion. But as Achamoth herself was only the daughter of Sophia, the last of the thirty Aeons, the Demiurge was distant by many emanations from the Supreme God. The Demiurge in creating this world out of Chaos was unconsciously influenced for good by Christ; and the universe, to the surprise even of its Maker, became almost perfect. The Demiurge regretted even its slight imperfection, and as he thought himself the Supreme God, he attempted to remedy this by sending a Messiah. To this Messiah, however, was actually united Christ the Saviour, who redeemed men.\n\nWith the doctrine of the creation of the world is connected the subject of the creation of man. According to it, the world-creating angels – not one, but many – create man, but the seed of the spirit comes into their creature without their knowledge, by the agency of a higher celestial Aeon, and they are then terrified by the faculty of speech by which their creature rises above them and try to destroy him.\n\nIt is significant that Valentinus himself is credited with having written a treatise upon the threefold nature of man, who is represented as at once spiritual, psychical, and material. In accordance with this there also arise three classes of men: the \"pneumatici\", the \"psychici\", and the \"hylici\". This doctrine dates at least as far back as Plato's \"Republic\".\n\n\nHowever, it is not unanimous the belief that material or psychical people were hopeless. Some have argued from the existent sources that humans could reincarnate in any of the three times, therefore a material or psychical person might have the chance to reborn in a future lifetime as a spiritual one.\n\nWe also find ideas that emphasize the distinction between the \"soma psychikon\" and the \"soma pneumatikon\":\n\nSalvation is not merely individual redemption of each human soul; it is a cosmic process. It is the return of all things to what they were before the flaw in the sphere of the Aeons brought matter into existence and imprisoned some part of the Divine Light into the evil \"Hyle\" (matter). This setting free of the light sparks is the process of salvation; when all light shall have left Hyle, it will be burnt up and destroyed.\n\nIn Valentinianism the process is extraordinarily elaborate, and we find here developed particularly clearly the myth of the heavenly marriage. This myth, as we shall see more fully below, and as may be mentioned here, is of great significance for the practical piety of the Valentinian Gnostics. It is the chief idea of their pious practices mystically to repeat the experience of this celestial union of the Saviour with Sophia. In this respect, consequently, the myth underwent yet wider development. Just as the Saviour is the bridegroom of Sophia, so the heavenly angels, who sometimes appear as the sons of the Saviour and Sophia, sometimes as the escort of the Saviour, are the males betrothed to the souls of the Gnostics, which are looked upon as feminine. Thus every Gnostic had her unfallen counterpart standing in the presence of God, and the object of a pious life was to bring about and experience this inner union with the celestial abstract personage. This leads us straight to the sacramental ideas of this branch of Gnosticism (see below). And it also explains the expression used of the Gnostics in Irenaeus, that they always meditate upon the secret of the heavenly union (the Syzygia).\n\n\"The final consummation of all things will take place when all that is spiritual has been formed and perfected by \"gnosis\".\"\n\nThe central point of the piety of Valentinus seems to have been that mystical contemplation of God; in a letter preserved in Clement of Alexandria, he sets forth that the soul of man is like an inn, which is inhabited by many evil spirits.\n\nBut this contemplation of God, as Valentinus declares, closely and deliberately following the doctrines of the Church and with him the compiler of the Gospel of John, is accomplished through the revelation of the Son. This mystic also discusses a vision which is preserved in the \"Philosophumena\" of Hippolytus:\n\nWith celestial enthusiasm Valentinus here surveys and depicts the heavenly world of Aeons, and its connection with the lower world. Exalted joy of battle and a valiant courage breathe forth in the sermon in which Valentinus addresses the faithful:\nThe authorities for the sacramental practices of the Valentinians are preserved especially in the accounts of the Marcosians given in Irenaeus i. 13 and 20, and in the last section of Clement of Alexandria's \"Excerpta ex Theodoto\".\n\nIn almost all the sacramental prayers of the Gnostics handed down to us by Irenaeus, the Mother is the object of the invocation. There are moreover various figures in the fully developed system of the Valentinians who are in the Gnostic's mind when he calls upon the Mother; sometimes it is the fallen Achamoth, sometimes the higher Sophia abiding in the celestial world, sometimes \"Aletheia\", the consort of the supreme heavenly father, but it is always the same idea, the Mother, on whom the faith of the Gnostics is fixed. Thus a baptismal confession of faith of the Gnostics runs: \nThe chief sacrament of the Valentinians seems to have been that of the bridal chamber (\"nymphon\"). The \"Gospel of Philip,\" a probable Valentinian text, reads:\nAs Sophia was united with the Saviour, her bridegroom, so the faithful would experience a union with their angel in the Pleroma (cf. the \"Higher Self\" or \"Holy Guardian Angel\"). The ritual of this sacrament is briefly indicated: \"A few of them prepare a bridal chamber and in it go through a form of consecration, employing certain fixed formulae, which are repeated over the person to be initiated, and stating that a spiritual marriage is to be performed after the pattern of the higher Syzygia.\" Through a fortunate chance, a liturgical formula which was used at this sacrament appears to be preserved, though in a garbled form and in an entirely different connection, the author seeming to have been uncertain as to its original meaning. It runs:\nOther key features of the doctrine of the Bridal Chamber included the use of mirrors as part of the decor and the idea that those who had partaken in the rituals would be able to beget children in the world to come.\n\nBesides this the Gnostics already practiced baptism, using the same form in all essentials as that of the Christian Church. The name given to baptism, at least among certain bodies, was \"apolytrosis\" (liberation); the baptismal formulae have been mentioned above.\n\nThe Gnostics are baptized in the mysterious name which also descended upon Jesus at his baptism. The angels of the Gnostics have also had to be baptized in this name, in order to bring about redemption for themselves and the souls belonging to them.\n\nIn the baptismal formulae the sacred name of the Redeemer is mentioned over and over again. In one of the formulae occur the words: \"I would enjoy thy name, Saviour of Truth.\" The concluding formula of the baptismal ceremony is: \"Peace over all upon whom the Name rests.\" This name pronounced at baptism over the faithful has above all the significance that the name will protect the soul in its ascent through the heavens, conduct it safely through all hostile powers to the lower heavens, and procure it access to Horos, who frightens back the lower souls by his magic word. And for this life also baptism, in consequence of the pronouncing of the protecting name over the baptized person, accomplishes his liberation from the lower daemonic powers. Before baptism the \"Heimarmene\" is supreme, but after baptism the soul is free from her.\n\nWith baptism was also connected the anointing with oil, and hence we can also understand the death sacrament occurring among some Valentinians consisting in an anointing with a mixture of oil and water. This death sacrament has naturally the express object of assuring the soul the way to the highest heaven \"so that the soul may be intangible and invisible to the higher mights and powers\". In this connection we also find a few formulae which are entrusted to the faithful, so that their souls may pronounce them on their journey upwards. One of these formulae runs:\nAnother formula is appended, in which there is a distinction in the invocation between the higher and lower Sophia. Another prayer of the same style is to be found in Irenaeus i. 13, and it is expressly stated that after prayer is pronounced the Mother throws the Homeric helmet (cf. the \"Tarnhelm\") over the faithful soul, and so makes him invisible to the mights and powers which surround and attack him.\n\nOn the other hand, a reaction took place here and there against the sacramental rites. A pure piety, rising above mere sacramentalism, breathes in the words of the Gnostics preserved in \"Excerpta ex Theodoto\", 78, 2:\nThe distinction between the human and divine Saviour was a major point of contention between the Valentinians and the Church. Valentinus separated Christ into three figures; the spiritual, the psychical and material. Each of the three Christ figures had its own meaning and purpose. They acknowledged that Christ suffered and died, but believed that \"in his incarnation, Christ transcended human nature so that he could prevail over death by divine power\". These beliefs are what caused Irenaeus to say of the Valentinians, \"Certainly they confess with their tongues the one Jesus Christ, but in their minds they divide him.\" In one passage in the account of Irenaeus, it is directly stated that the redeemer assumed a psychical body to redeem the psychical, for the spiritual already belong by nature to the celestial world and no longer require any \"historical\" redemption, while the material is incapable of redemption, as \"flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption\".\n\nMany Valentinian traditions and practices also clashed with those of the Church. They often met at unauthorized gatherings and rejected ecclesiastical authority, based on their belief that they were all equal. Members of the movement took turns administering sacraments, as well as preaching. Among the Valentinians, women were considered to be equal, or at least nearly equal to men. There were female prophets, teachers, healers, evangelists and even priests, which was very different from the Church's view of women at the time. Valentinians held normal jobs, got married and raised children just like Christians; however they regarded these pursuits as being less important than gnosis, which was to be achieved individually. The beliefs of the Valentinians were much more oriented towards the individual than the group, and salvation was not seen as being universal, as it was in the Church.\n\nThe main disagreements between the Valentinians and the Church were in the notions that God and the creator were two separate entities, the idea that the creator was flawed and formed man and Earth out of ignorance and confusion, and the separation of Christ's human form and divine form. Church authorities believed that Valentinian theology was \"a wickedly casuistic way of subverting their authority and thereby threatening the ecclesiastical order with anarchy.\" The practices and rituals of the Valentinians were also different from those of the Christian Church; however they considered themselves to be Christians and not pagans or heretics. By referring to themselves as Christians they worsened their relationship with the Church, who viewed them not only as heretics, but as rivals.\n\nAlthough the Valentinians publicly professed their faith in one God, \"in their own private meetings they insisted on discriminating between the popular image of God – as master, king, lord, creator, and judge – and what that image represented: God understood as the ultimate source of all being.\" Aside from the Church fathers, however, \"the majority of Christians did not recognize the followers of Valentinus as heretics. Most could not tell the difference between Valentinian and orthodox teaching.\" This was partially because Valentinus used many books that now belong to the Old and New Testaments as a basis for interpretation in his own writing. He based his work on proto-orthodox Christian canon instead of on Gnostic scripture, and his style was similar to that of early Christian works. In this way, Valentinus tried to bridge the gap between Gnostic religion and early Catholicism. By attempting to bridge this gap, however, Valentinus and his followers became the proverbial wolves in sheep's clothing. \"The apparent similarity with orthodox teaching only made this heresy more dangerous – like poison disguised as milk.\" Valentinian Gnosticism was \"the most influential and sophisticated form of Gnostic teaching, and by far the most threatening to the church.\"\n\nEarly Christianity has been described as \"a complex network of individual parties, groups, sects, or denominations.\" This inconsistency made Gnostic sects such as Valentinianism threatening to the proto-orthodox sect.\n\nValentinian works are named in reference to the bishop and teacher Valentinius. Circa 153 AD, Valentinius developed a complex cosmology outside the Sethian tradition. At one point he was close to being appointed the Bishop of Rome of what is now the Roman Catholic Church. Works attributed to his school are listed below, and fragmentary pieces directly linked to him are noted with an asterisk:\n\n\n\nAttribution:\n\n"}

WXPN produces \"World Cafe\", a music program distributed by NPR to many non-commercial stations in the United States. The station's call sign, which is often abbreviated to XPN, stands for \"Experimental Pennsylvania Network\". The broadcast tower used by WXPN is located at (), in the antenna farm complex in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia.\n\nWhile the University of Pennsylvania has been involved with radio since 1909 when a wireless station was located in Houston Hall, WXPN itself first came into existence in 1945 as a carrier current station at 730 AM. In 1957, it was granted a full license as a 10-watt college radio station at 88.9 FM in addition to their frequency of 730 AM. From then into the mid-1970s, WXPN was a student activity of the university and as it grew, the station initiated unique programming designs including one of the earliest freeform radio formats, Phase II, in the 1960s. Local DJ Michael Tearson got his start at WXPN in the late 1960s with a radio show \"The Attic\". Tearson went on to replace Dave Herman at WMMR in 1970. In 1975, a controversial broadcast on the talk show \"The Vegetable Report\" led to an obscenity complaint with the FCC, which found the charges serious enough to decline renewal of the broadcast license. This incident (December 1975) marked the first time FCC pulled a license on grounds of obscenity. But a citizen's group organized to petition the FCC to consider XPN's unique service, and with a pledge from Penn to create positions for professional staff to run the station, the FCC allowed the license to renew.\n\nWith this new staff of five managers, WXPN became a steady fountain of high-quality folk, jazz, new and avant-garde music and public affairs programming produced by a combination of Penn students/alumni and community volunteers. Veterans of WXPN that have gone on to notable achievements in other areas include Broadway producer/director Harold Prince (the station's first program director), NBC news correspondent Andrea Mitchell (former news director); jazz producer Michael Cuscuna (former DJ) and Echoes producers John Diliberto and Kimberly Haas (former producers of \"Diaspar\" and other XPN shows).\nShows that have been staples on XPN since the '70s include \"The Blues Show with Jonny Meister\" (Saturday nights), \"Sleepy Hollow\" (Saturday and Sunday morning quiet music shows), \"Star's End\" (ambient and space music Saturday night/Sunday morning) and \"Amazon Country\" (lesbian-oriented music and programming on Sunday evening). XPN also broadcasts the Folk Show on Sunday evening, which started at WHAT-FM in 1962 and continued on WDAS-FM, WMMR, WIOQ and WHYY-FM but moved to WXPN in the '90s when WHYY changed to a talk format.\n\nIn 1986 the station qualified for membership in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and began the legal process to move from 88.9 to 88.5 on the FM broadcast band in order to increase signal coverage. Beginning the late 1980s, the programming and personnel were shifted from its diverse volunteer voice to full-time salaried programmers. Penn student radio activity is currently carried out on WQHS.\n\nIn 1988, WXPN started \"Kids Corner\", a daily interactive radio show for kids hosted by Kathy O'Connell. \"Kids Corner\" has won numerous awards, including the Peabody Award and the Armstrong Award.\n\nIn 2004, WXPN moved to new facilities at 3025 Walnut Street, where the radio station shares space with a music venue called World Cafe Live. (World Cafe Live is an independent for-profit entity that pays a yearly fee to license the World Cafe name from WXPN.)\n\nIn October 2015, WXPN and WNTI jointly announced a sales agreement for transfer of ownership of the Hackettstown, NJ, public radio station owned by Centenary College. The sale price is $1,250,000 in cash and another $500,000 in underwriting value over 10 years. A Public Service Operating Agreement enabled WXPN to begin using the WNTI transmission facilities to air WXPN programming, effective October 15, 2015. WNTI changed its call sign to WXPJ on May 16, 2016.\n\nWXPN carries primarily locally originated programs, supplemented by a few nationally syndicated shows. The station's weekday programs are all produced by its own staff, including \"World Cafe\", a show developed and hosted by WXPN host David Dye and now distributed by NPR. The station also produces most of its night and weekend specialty programs, including Kids Corner with Kathy O'Connell, \"The Geator's Rock & Roll, Rhythm & Blues Express\" with legendary Philadelphia DJ Jerry Blavat, \"The Blues Show\" with Jonny Meister, \"The Folk Show\" with Ian Zolitor and \"Sleepy Hollow\", an early morning program of quiet music. The station's syndicated offerings include \"The Grateful Dead Hour\" with David Gans, \"The Many Moods of Ben Vaughn\", \"Echoes\" with John Diliberto and \"Mountain Stage\" with Larry Groce.\n\nWXPN also broadcasts the Penn Quakers men's basketball games.\n\nFrom August 15 to August 18, 2019, WXPN broadcast a \"Woodstock — As It Happened — 50 Years On\" weekend to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Woodstock festival. It used all of the festival's archived audio in \"as close to real time as possible\", using newly reconstructed audio archives of each of Woodstock’s 32 performances.\n\nOne full-power station (WXPH) is licensed to simulcast the programming of WXPN full-time. One full-power station (WXPJ) currently has a Public Service Operating Agreement to simulcast the programming of WXPN.\n\nWXPN programming is broadcast on the following translators:\n\nFrom 1993 to 2007, the WXPH call sign was used on 88.1 in Harrisburg, now WZXM. WXPN traded that facility to Four Rivers Community Broadcasting in return for 88.7 Middletown and W259AU.\n\nPortions of WXPN's schedule are simulcast on WKHS 90.5 FM, Worton, Maryland (Eastern Shore Chesapeake Bay and Baltimore, Maryland areas).\n\nXPN2/XPoNential Radio is an Adult Album Alternative radio station broadcast on the HD2 channels of WXPN in Philadelphia and WXPH in Middletown, Pennsylvania. The station is also syndicated to several other public radio stations, which air it on their HD2 or HD3 channels.\n\nOn May 2, 2007, WXPN launched an indie rock format on its HD2 channel, branded as \"Y-Rock on XPN\". Y-Rock on XPN featured on-air personalities originally from Philadelphia radio station WPLY 100.3 FM, branded as \"Y100\". WPLY owner Radio One changed the station's format in 2005, ending the alternative rock format. Y-Rock on XPN was the latest incarnation of the Y100 brand that originally aired on WPLY, which was the market's alternative rock station from 1995 until 2005.\n\nIn mid-June 2010, \"Y-Rock on XPN\" programming was cancelled due to budget cuts. The \"Y-Rock on XPN\" branding officially changed to XPN2 at midnight, June 15, 2011. The HD2 channel and companion online stream would later be re-branded as \"XpoNential Radio\".\n\nIn 1970, WXPN-AM's operations moved from Houston Hall, directly in the center of campus, to 3905 Spruce Street. The FM radio station became professionally run by 1980, with a mix of community volunteers and students staffing the station, while the AM radio station was still student-run. WXPN-AM then became WQHS, which stands for Quad Hill Superblock (referring to student dormitories on campus). As of September 2005, the radio station is located on the 5th floor of the Hollenback Center, on the far east side of campus.\n\nIn 2003, the WQHS radio tower, formerly on top of Harnwell College House, fell in a severe storm. As a result, WQHS now broadcasts exclusively over the Internet, in an eclectic freeform radio format.\n\n\n"}

Its capital was Stuttgart. In 1952, Württemberg-Baden merged with Württemberg-Hohenzollern and Baden into the present state of Baden-Württemberg.\n\nWürttemberg-Baden consisted of the northern halves of the former states of Württemberg and Baden. The southern border of this part of the US-administered zone was set so that the autobahn connecting Karlsruhe and Munich (today the A8) was completely contained within the American zone. The three major subdivisions of the American zone (Greater Hesse, Bavaria and Württemberg-Baden) were declared on 19 September 1945.\n\nOn 24 November 1946, a new constitution was enacted and Württemberg-Baden's first parliament was elected. On 23 May 1949, the state became a founding member of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nA straw poll was held on 24 September 1950 in Württemberg-Baden, Württemberg-Hohenzollern and Baden regarding a merger of the three states, followed by a public referendum on 16 December 1951. On both occasions, voters in Württemberg-Baden returned a clear majority in favour of a merger. All three states were merged and the modern German state of Baden-Württemberg was founded on 25 April 1952.\n\nThe only minister-president of Württemberg-Baden was Reinhold Maier (DVP, then FDP; 1946–1952). Maier went on to become the first minister-president of Baden-Württemberg upon its formation in 1952.\n\nWürttemberg-Baden was subdivided into two administrative districts, known as \"Landesbezirke\". The boundaries for these two districts were taken from two former state sections that comprised Württemberg-Baden. These two districts remain largely unchanged today as the Regierungsbezirke of Stuttgart (Württemberg) and Karlsruhe (Baden) within Baden-Württemberg.\n\nThe flag of Württemberg-Baden, adopted in 1947, was the black-red-gold tricolour flag of Germany which was later also adopted again by the new German states founded in 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic.\n\nThe coat of arms merges elements from the two predecessor states: the red stripe on a golden field of the coat of arms of Baden and the three deer antlers of the coat of arms of Württemberg.\n\n"}

It has a horizontal stabiliser in a T-tail configuration and a retractable tricycle landing gear. It has two rear-pylon-mounted Pratt & Whitney Canada PW535E turbofan engines. The enclosed cabin has room for nine passengers and a two-pilot crew; during single-pilot operation an additional passenger can be carried. Access to the cockpit and cabin is via an airstair on the left-hand side.\n\nIts structural life is 28,000 flight cycles or 35,000 hours. It is built of 18% composite materials; it has winglets, but not thrust reversers. The Phenom 300 has single-point refueling and an externally serviced private rear lavatory.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 500th unit was delivered in March 2019. The Phenom 300 became the most delivered business jet with 60 units in 2013. This was also the case in 2014 and 2015.\n\nAll Phenom assembly was shifted to the Melbourne, Florida line after July 2016, with a capability of assembling 96 Phenoms and 72 Embraer Legacy 450/Embraer Legacy 500 annually. More than 170 Phenom jets had been produced at the site by June 2016, mainly for the US market.\n\nIn March 2019, Embraer delivered the 500th Phenom 300, claiming more than half of the light jet market share since 2012. It was being used in over 30 countries and had carried 2.5 million passengers in 600,000 flights and 800,000 hours.\n\nThe Phenom 300 was involved in three Hull-loss accidents causing four fatalities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1946645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946645", "title": "Der Corregidor", "text": "Der Corregidor\n\nDer Corregidor is a comic opera by Hugo Wolf. The German libretto was written by Rosa Mayreder-Obermayer, based on the short novel \"El sombrero de tres picos\" by Pedro Antonio de Alarcón.\n\nWolf composed the opera in 1895 and revised it in 1897. The score is published by C.F. Peters.\nThe opera was first performed at the Nationaltheater Mannheim on 7 June 1896, under the baton of Hugo Röhr.\n\nGustav Mahler made an arrangement of the opera's prelude.\n\nScene 1: Tio Lukas is picking grapes and preparing his millyard for the arrival of an unnamed Bishop and conversing with a neighbor. The neighbor taunts Lukas, saying that the only reason people show him any favor is because he has such a pretty wife. Lukas shrugs off the comment. The neighbor leaves, and Lukas climbs up into an arbor to continue his preparations.\n\nScene 2: Frasquita enters the yard and sets the table while singing to herself. Lukas surprises her from the arbor and teases her about the affections of the Corregidor, magistrate of the province in which they live. Lukas spies the Corregidor approaching with Repela, his servant, and goes back into hiding in order to spy on the old man's conversation.\n\nScene 3: Repela enters, taking a pinch of snuff and sneezing violently. Frasquita tells him that Lukas is asleep, which Repela is interested to know. He runs off to tell his master that Frasquita is apparently alone.\n\nScene 4: The Corregidor approaches Frasquita, who flirts with him and dances a fandango. He is afraid that her dancing might wake Lukas. She threatens to wake Lukas (with the song \"\"In dem Schatten meiner Locken\"\" from the \"Spanisches Liederbuch)\", but relents when the Corregidor urges her not to. The Corregidor is so taken by Frasquita that he is dumbstruck for a moment. He begins to woo her, and she seizes the opportunity to press for a favor she has obviously already requested many times: the appointment of her nephew as court notary in the nearby town of Estella. The Corregidor refuses, and his advances become ever more ardent. In his passion, he loses his balance and crashes to the ground. Lukas takes this cue to reveal himself. The couple ridicules the old man, who, realizing that Lukas has heard the entire exchange, childishly vows his revenge. Frasquita offers him some grapes in order to placate him, but he hesitates.\n\nScene 5: Repela, who has also been watching the entire scene, enters, intending to reprimand Frasquita for her behaviour. He is interrupted by the sound of the Bishop's arrival in the distance. Lukas and Frasquita rush off to finish their preparations, while the Corregidor sends Repela off to set his revenge plan in motion. The Bishop approaches amid an onstage brass fanfare.\n\nScene 1: In the kitchen at the millhouse, Lukas and Frasquita are eating dinner and discussing, first teasingly, then passionately, how happy they are together. They are interrupted by a knock at the door. It is Tonuelo, one of the Alkalde's servants, coming under the banner of the “rule of law.” He is very, very drunk.\n\nScene 2: Tonuelo summons Lukas to the Alkalde, the local mayor. Lukas says he will go in the morning, but Tonuelo insists that he come immediately. Frasquita wishes to accompany him, but Tonuelo again relays that he is to summon Lukas only. The two men exit, leaving Frasquita alone.\n\nScene 3: Frasquita begins to tidy up the dishes. She then sits down to her spinning wheel and muses to herself about Tonuelo's summons. From outside, she hears a sudden shout for help. Thinking it is Lukas, she rushes to the door, only to discover that it is the Corregidor, who has fallen into the millstream.\n\nScene 4: The Corregidor enters the house, soaking wet from the stream. Frasquita becomes angry, realizing at once what the Corregidor has intended all along. He attempts to bribe Frasquita into bed with her nephew's appointment, and when she refuses, he threatens her with a pistol. She in turn pulls out a blunderbuss, at which point the Corregidor is so overcome with fright that he becomes faint. He asks her to call Repela.\n\nScene 5: Repela enters to tend to the Corregidor, while Frasquita prepares to leave on the pretense of summoning a doctor from town. In reality, she leaves to find Lukas and to inform the Corregidora of what her husband is up to.\n\nScene 6: The Corregidor removes his wet clothes, instructing Repela to hang them by the fire to dry. Realizing that Frasquita is no longer there, he sends Repela off to intercept her before she reaches town. The Corregidor, alone, sings to himself, in another song from the \"Spanisches Liederbuch\" (\"Herz, verzage nicht geschwind\") about the strange behaviour of women.\n\nScene 7: The Alkalde and his servants Manuela and Pedro are drinking together. Lukas and Tonuelo enter through a rear door.\n\nScene 8: The revelers drink to Lukas, even though he is clearly not in the mood to be trifled with. Lukas tricks the group into a drinking game, then pretends to go to sleep on a bench. The drunken servants go off to find their own beds.\n\nScene 9: Lukas, enraged, gets up and escapes out of the window.\n\nScene 10: After a few moments, Manuela enters the room to ask Lukas to hire her away from the Alkalde. Realizing that Lukas is no longer there, she rouses the rest of the household.\n\nScene 11: Pedro and Tonuelo join Manuela, and the three reluctantly go out to search for Lukas.\n\nScene 1: Frasquita makes her way to the Alkalde's house to find Lukas. Unbeknownst to either, Lukas passes her on his way back to the mill. She speaks to herself nervously. Repela enters, but Frasquita does not notice him yet.\n\nScene 2: Repela reveals himself. He mocks Frasquita, and she yells at him. They decide to go off together in search of Lukas. \"This is followed by another episode of scene-change music.\"\n\nScene 3: Lukas arrives back at the mill. He notices the Corregidor's clothes still hanging by the fire and the notary appointment on the table, and jumps to the obvious conclusion. Grabbing the blunderbuss, he creeps towards the bedroom door. Seeing the Corregidor asleep on the bed, Lukas berates himself quietly in a fit of humiliation and jealousy. Suddenly realizing that the Corregidor also has a pretty wife, he forms his own plan for vengeance. Donning the Corregidor's clothes and laughing, Lukas heads for the Corregidor's house.\n\nScene 4: The Corregidor, awoken by Lukas, cautiously comes out of the bedroom. Vexed that his own clothes have apparently been stolen, he puts on those that Lukas left behind. The Alkalde enters with Frasquita, Tonuelo and Repela, but they do not yet notice the Corregidor, who tries to slip back into the bedroom.\n\nScene 5: The Alkalde notices the Corregidor, but thinking he is Lukas, orders Tonuelo to apprehend him. Tonuelo knocks the Corregidor to the ground, but the group quickly realizes their mistake. After Repela divines Lukas's intent in stealing the Corregidor's clothes, everyone agrees to head off to the Corregidor's house.\n\nScene 1: In front of the Corregidor's house, a night watchman announces 5:30 AM.\n\nScene 2: The Corregidor, Frasquita, Repela, Tonuelo and the Alkalde arrive at the Corregidor's house. They knock, but there is no reply. Repela, making light of the situation, pretends that he is serenading the house by faking the sound of a guitar. Finally the Duenna wakes up and comes to the window. The Corregidor announces his presence, but the Duenna does not believe him, saying that the lord of the house is already home. Realizing who that must be, Frasquita despairs that Lukas did indeed think her unfaithful. The Corregidor does not understand what is going on.\n\nScene 3: A troop of officers and servants bursts out of the gate and start to beat the party. They try to run away and explain their presence at the same time. The chorus of soldiers sings confusedly. The Corregidor still does not understand what is going on.\n\nScene 4: Donna Mercedes, the Corregidora, appears in the plaza. Although she has already sized up the situation, she continues to treat her husband as if he were Lukas. The Corregidor, finally realizing what is going on, attempts to blame Frasquita for everything that has happened, but his wife does not let him get away with it.\n\nScene 5: Lukas enters, still dressed in the Corregidor's clothes and imitating the Corregidor's mannerisms. After everyone's true identity is revealed, the characters recap the story and explain what happened when Lukas arrived in disguise at the Corregidor's house (Wolf cut most of this section in his 1897 revision). Lukas and Frasquita are reconciled, and the Corregidor gives way, realizing that he has been bested. The ensemble thanks the Corregidora with respect and gratitude for her benevolent intervention.\n\nThere are two complete recordings (cast key is \"Conductor/Mercedes/Frasquita/Eugenio/Lukas/Repela\"):\nNote: Line Music re-released this in 2002 on CD, a performance recorded by German radio at the Semperoper in Dresden, with Karl Erb in the title role.\n\n"}

As of April 2017, 350 were in service in 37 countries.\n\nThe Phenom 100 has an oval fuselage with a 7.985 m³ (282 ft³) passenger cabin, a 1.47 m-high by 0.74 m-wide (4.5'x2.1') door and 1.2'x1' windows.\nIts unpressurized cargo hold is 1.56 m³ (54.9ft³).\nIts structural life is 28,000 flight cycles or 35,000 hours, and it is built of 20% composite materials.\n\nIt has capacity for four passengers in its normal configuration, but it can carry up to seven passengers with a single crew, with an optional side-facing seat and belted toilet. The cabin interior is designed by BMW DesignworksUSA.\n\nThe aircraft is fitted with two rear-mounted Pratt & Whitney Canada PW617-F turbofan engines rated at a takeoff thrust of 7.2 kN (1,695 lb) to ISA+10 °C. The engines have dual full authority digital engine control (FADEC). An automatic performance reserve (APR) feature boosts engine output to 1,777 lb in the event of engine failure on takeoff. Later model PW 617 F-E models have a ten-minute thrust rating at 1,820 lb.\nIt has a maximum flying range of with four occupants and NBAA IFR Reserves.\n\nIn April 2005 Embraer's board of directors approved the development of very light and light jets. On November 9, the company announced at the annual NBAA convention that the very light jet would be called the \"Phenom 100\", and displayed a full-scale mock-up of the aircraft.\n\nThe aircraft first flew on July 26, 2007 at São José dos Campos, Brazil. It was awarded a type certificate from Brazil's National Civil Aviation Authority on December 9, 2008 The first aircraft was delivered on December 24, 2008.\n\n\nThe aircraft is operated by private individuals, companies, fractionals, charter operators, aircraft management companies, and military operators.\nIts 2009 price was US$ 3.6 million, and US$4.16 million in 2015. A Phenom 100 may cost around /mile to operate.\n\n\nEmbraer was originally planning to deliver 15 Phenom 100s in 2008 and 120–150 aircraft in 2009 but it ended up delivering only two aircraft in 2008 and had to trim its 2009 plan to 97 aircraft. Embraer had about 30 orders in late 2014.\n\nAll Phenom assembly was to be shifted to the Melbourne, Florida line from July 2016. The facility will be able to assemble up to 96 Phenoms and 72 Embraer Legacy 450/Embraer Legacy 500 annually. More than 170 Phenom jets have been produced at the site until June 2016, mainly for the US market.\nThe company had two production lines for the Phenom 100EV, the other in Brazil.

The village is located on the northwestern part of the Nordkinn Peninsula, on the shore of a small fjord which empties into the larger Laksefjorden. The village has a population (2017) of 945, which gives the village a population density of and makes it the largest village in the municipality and one of the largest fishing villages in Finnmark county.\n\nThe Hurtigruten coastal express boat has regular stops at Kjøllefjord. Kjøllefjord Church is located in the village. One of the largest fish processing and fishing companies in Kjøllefjord is a branch of Aker Seafoods. Another large company is Laksefjord Seafood AS. Kjøllefjord Airport once served the village, but it is now closed.\n\nLike all other fishing villages, Kjøllefjord has fishing as their main business. At 24 June 2015, there is a single fish processing plant operating in Kjøllefjord, Aarsæther, which has since been bought by Aker Seafoods AS, now called Norway Seafood. The company is owned by Kjell Inge Røkke. Aker Seafood has plans to continue production here as well as plans to repair and update the buildings.\n\nIn the 1970s, the small Kjøllefjord Airport was established for passenger and ambulance flights, but in the 1980s it was abandoned when the nearby Mehamn Airport was opened. Today, Mehamn Airport has routes to Hammerfest, Tromsø, Vadsø, and Kirkenes.\n\nIn 2005, Statkraft constructed a wind farm near the mountain Gartefjellet, with a maximum capacity of . The 17 wind turbines have an annual power output of and provide for the electrical needs of about 6,000 households.\n\nThe newspaper \"Kyst og Fjord\" is published in Kjøllefjord.\n\nKjøllefjord has been a trading post and fishing village serving the northern edge of Norway, along the Barents Sea since around the 1500s. In 1685, the county governor Hans H. Lilienskiold took a journey along the coast of Finnmark county. He visited the village of Kjøllefjord and he noted that there was a landowning widow who also traded while three other traders worked here for merchants from Bergen.\n\nIn 1690, Finnmark county was divided into seven trading districts. The author Jonas Lie wrote in the book \"Tremasteren Fremtiden\" about the village of Kjøllefjord. He gives a picture of the old monopoly trade system of that era. He writes: «Som opplagssted for Finnmarkske produkter der hentedes av bergensere og senere danske skip, som havn for russiske lodjer der lå og tusket langs kysten, og som nødhavn for fremmede skip i hvitehavsfarten på Arkhangelsk, hersket der alltid meget liv og røre» which means \"As a storeroom for Finnmark products, which were picked up by ships from Bergen and later by Danish ships, as a port for Russian lodgers who bartered and traded along the coast, and as a haven for foreign ships from the White Sea that were shipping from Arkhangelsk, there was always a lot of life and stir.\"\n\nLike so many other places in Finnmark, Kjøllefjord's buildings were set ablaze by German soldiers in the fall of 1944, and the entire population of approximately 700 people were evacuated and scattered throughout the country. After the liberation in 1945, most residents came back. The rebuilding began, regulation plans were prepared and eventually the permanent building plans. In a very short time, the business community was rebuilt and nine relatively modern fisheries started up their business.\n\nThe fishing fleet grew rapidly, and many skilled fishermen brought ashore an annual average of of fish in the years 1950, 1951, and 1952. This large haul included was pollock, were cod, of herring, and of other fish species. In 1954, the fishing fleet totaled 155 boats. Of these, 27 boats were between and there were ten boats over . The rest of the boats were under . Throughout history, fishing has been the nerve center for the community's activities, in good as well as bad times. After the war, 14 stores, two smaller hotels, and five cafes were built ad the population increased up to 1,700 inhabitants.\n\nIn recent years tourism has become an important part of Kjøllefjord's economy. \"Arctic Coast AS\" holds the primary responsibility for tourist information and excursions in and around Kjøllefjord. The company offers a snowmobile safari under the northern lights, guided bus tours and, in collaboration with Davvi Siida, excursions based on Sami culture and local history for tourists all year round.\n\nIn the greater Kjøllefjord area, there are over of marked hiking trails, several of these originate from Kjøllefjord. Most of these trails are old trails where people walked between the settlements in the old days. There is a wonderful view of all the trails in the area, and it is easy to navigate. Areas west of the peninsula is very popular for hunting and fishing. Grouse is the most common prey, but people also hunt a lot of hares. The waters around Kjøllefjord you can find large Arctic char and trout populations. On 3 July 2013, a new world record for halibut caught on a fishing rod was set when someone pulled in a fish!\n\nThe Finnkirka (inspiration for the municipal coat of arms) is located on the west side of the Nordkinnhalvøya and is a majestic and weathered sea cliff that has a shape that resembles a church. It is believed to have once been an ancient Sami sacrificial site, and is still used as a landmark for seafarers. During the winter, the municipality has bright, colored lights (representing the northern lights) that light up the cliffs.\n\nKjøllefjord is known for its active cultural life which includes the \"Chrisfestivalen\" music festival. Every summer in late June, this small music festival is held and it is named after blues artist Christian (Kris) Lyngedal who was from Kjøllefjord.\n\nFootball is a popular sport in Kjøllefjord for adolescents and adults. Kjøllefjord and neighboring Mehamn share a single team (since 1992) in the Nordkynn football club, which plays in the 3rd division of Norwegian football. In 1987, a sports hall was constructed.\n\nThe scenery in the area is diverse, with both plateaus and valleys with rich vegetation. After about a 20-minute hike from Kjøllefjord to the east, one comes to the world's northernmost broadleaf forests with large birch trees. The area consists of Oksevågdalen, where one finds rivers and lakes.\n\nThe climate can be summarized as follows: Most of the precipitation falls in the autumn and the winter. April and May are the driest months. Precipitation then rises again somewhat during the summer. February is the coldest month and July / August are the hottest months of the year. Southerly winds are most prominent in the autumn and winter months and northerly winds most prominent summer. Dark season lasts from November 18 to January 25, while the bright nights beginning April 24 and ending on August 20. The midnight sun can be seen the first time on May 13 and the last time on July 31.\n\nKjøllefjord sits near the western edge of the Øst-Finnmark district. The place is totally out onto the Arctic Ocean, therefore there may be harsh conditions from northwesterly winds. Two inner breakwaters screen the marina and industrial piers from the sea. Kjøllefjord is from the airport in Mehamn, Mehamn Airport. In 1989 a road was completed to Kjøllefjord, finally connecting it to the rest of Norway by road.\n\nThe school building that stands in Kjøllefjord was new at the start of the school year in 1956, and in 1963 it was added on to. In connection with the introduction of the Curriculum in 1997 they got a modern annex which is currently used for 1st grade and the SFO. At primary school in Kjøllefjord there are about 150 pupils in 1st-10th grade. The school has a total of 23 teachers plus several assistants and support staff.\n\nSince 2005, Kjøllefjord joined the LOSA project, which gave high school students the opportunity to take their first year of high school online from home rather than traveling to the nearest high school (which can be far away).\n"}

Once the county seat of Washita County, it is now considered a ghost town. Only a few buildings remain, mostly in disrepair.\n\nThe townsite was platted in April, 1892, as Tacola, when the Cheyenne-Arapaho reservation was opened for settlement. A few weeks later, the town population was said to be over 3,000 inhabitants. \nThe post office was established March 29, 1892, and Cloud Chief was designated by the U.S. Congress as the county seat of H County, Oklahoma Territory. Many of the new settlers left the town within a year. Cloud Chief was at the fringe of \"Texas\" and as a result was settled mainly by Texans. Nobody who competed for the town lots could ever forget the excitement. Fights over claims were commonplace, and the cry of \"claimjumper\" was heard. In two hours the town was established. Many of the settlers left almost immediately after their claims were legally staked, for they had six months from the time they filed to the time they had to settle on their claims.\n\nMany of the settlers went home to get their families and households. Many had left their business hanging fire until they found out whether or not they could actually find a claim in the newly opened country. They had to sell out or close out their business and farms back home.\n\nThe population dwindled, but only for six months. Then the town began its growth that was to continue for an eight-year period. When Cloud Chief was at its peak it had population of about 700 people. However, by 1898 the population had begun to rise again.\n\nIn 1900 the people of newly formed Washita County, by a vote of 1,349 in favor to 282 in opposition, illegally moved the county seat to the more-centrally-located town of Cordell. Lawsuits followed, and reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled the move illegal in 1904. Two county commissioners went to Washington D.C. and persuaded Congress to pass legislation approving the move. President Theodore Roosevelt signed the law in 1906.\n\nThe Cloud Chief public schools opened for the 1892–1893 school year. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) built a high school in 1938, which closed after the 1959–1960 school year. The high school was known as the Cloud Chief Warriors. The Cloud Chief post office closed on December 31, 1964. The town also lost its charter in 1964.\n\nCloud Chief was also previously home of two newspapers. It was home to the \"Cloud Chief Witness\", as well as the \"Cloud Chief Beacon\". The \"Cloud Chief Beacon\" moved and became the \"Cordell Beacon\" immediately after the August 17, 1900 issue was printed. After moving to Cordell, the newspaper continued publication from January 13, 1905 until February 17, 1919.\n\n\n"}

This was then usually shrink wrapped in plastic. Some singles contained one song on each side, much as 45s had done, but others repeated the songs on both sides. In some markets, cassette singles generally used the same packaging as standard cassettes, a plastic box with a paper insert.\n\nAs the cassette maxi-single was released, more intricate packaging was incorporated that looked similar to the packaging of a regular cassette release. These were placed in regular plastic cassette cases with a paper/cardstock insert. Unlike a full-length cassette album, these were generally only one two-sided inlay instead of a fold-out. Maxi-singles usually contained four versions of a single song, i.e.: unique mixes & edits, but some contained versions of two different songs.\n\nAlthough the cassette had reached a high level of popularity by the late 1980s, due to the ubiquity of mobile devices such as the Sony Walkman, the boombox and car audio cassette players, cassette singles never rivalled gramophone records to even near the same extent as cassette albums had done. In the U.S., cassette singles were completely phased out by the mid 2000s. One reason for their lesser popularity was because they appeared to be an inefficient use of the media to consumers - a cassette single took up the same storage space as a full album. In April 2013, however, psychedelic rock band MGMT released the first single from their third album as a cassette single, and October 2014 saw the cassingle \"Great Big Happy Green Moonface\" from Polaris, the band's first release in fifteen years.\n"}

Groenewold) is perhaps the best-known example of a phase-space star product. It is an associative, non-commutative product, ★, on the functions on ℝ, equipped with its Poisson bracket (with a generalization to symplectic manifolds, described below). It is a special case of the ★-product of the \"algebra of symbols\" of a universal enveloping algebra.\n\nThe Moyal product is named after José Enrique Moyal, but is also sometimes called the Weyl–Groenewold product as it was introduced by H. J. Groenewold in his 1946 doctoral dissertation, in a trenchant appreciation of the Weyl correspondence. Moyal actually appears not to know about the product in his celebrated article and was crucially lacking it in his legendary correspondence with Dirac, as illustrated in his biography. The popular naming after Moyal appears to have emerged only in the 1970s, in homage to his flat phase-space quantization picture.\n\nThe product for smooth functions \"f\" and \"g\" on ℝ takes the form\n\nwhere each \"C\" is a certain bidifferential operator of order \"n\" characterized by the following properties (see below for an explicit formula):\n\n\nNote that, if one wishes to take functions valued in the real numbers, then an alternative version eliminates the formula_6 in condition 2 and eliminates condition 4.\n\nIf one restricts to polynomial functions, the above algebra is isomorphic to the Weyl algebra \"A\", and the two offer alternative realizations of the Weyl map of the space of polynomials in variables (or the symmetric algebra of a vector space of dimension 2\"n\").\n\nTo provide an explicit formula, consider a constant Poisson bivector Π on ℝ:\nwhere Π is a complex number for each \"i\", \"j\".\n\nThe star product of two functions formula_8 and formula_9 can then be defined as\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, treated as a formal parameter here. This is a special case of what is known as the Berezin formula on the algebra of symbols and can be given a closed form (which follows from the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula). The closed form can be obtained by using the exponential:\nwhere formula_12 is the multiplication map, formula_13, and the exponential is treated as a power series:\n\nThat is, the formula for formula_15 is\n\nAs indicated, often one eliminates all occurrences of formula_6 above, and the formulas then restrict naturally to real numbers.\n\nNote that if the functions \"f\" and \"g\" are polynomials, the above infinite sums become finite (reducing to the ordinary Weyl-algebra case).\n\nThe relationship of the Moyal product to the generalized ★-product used in the definition of the \"algebra of symbols\" of a universal enveloping algebra follows from the fact that the Weyl algebra is the universal enveloping algebra of the Heisenberg algebra (modulo that the center equals the unit).\n\nOn any symplectic manifold, one can, at least locally, choose coordinates so as to make the symplectic structure \"constant\", by Darboux's theorem; and, using the associated Poisson bivector, one may consider the above formula. For it to work globally,\nas a function on the whole manifold (and not just a local formula), one must equip the symplectic manifold with a torsion-free symplectic connection. This makes it a Fedosov manifold.\n\nMore general results for \"arbitrary Poisson manifolds\" (where the Darboux theorem does not apply) are given by the Kontsevich quantization formula.\n\nA simple explicit example of the construction and utility of the -product (for the simplest case of a two-dimensional euclidean phase space) is given in the article on the Wigner–Weyl transform: two Gaussians compose with this -product according to a hyperbolic tangent law:\n\n\"Every correspondence prescription\" between phase space and Hilbert space, however, induces \"its own\" proper -product.\n\nSimilar results are seen in the Segal–Bargmann space and in the theta representation of the Heisenberg group, where the creation and annihilation operators formula_19 and formula_20 are understood to act on the complex plane (respectively, the upper half-plane for the Heisenberg group), so that the position and momenta operators are given by formula_21 and formula_22. This situation is clearly different from the case where the positions are taken to be real-valued, but does offer insights into the overall algebraic structure of the Heisenberg algebra and its envelope, the Weyl algebra.\n"}

Up until the 1990s, neutrinos were assumed to be massless, but experimental results from searches for solar neutrinos (those produced in the Sun's core) and others are inconsistent with this assumption, and thus indicate that the neutrino does have a very small mass (see Solar neutrino problem).\n\nThe Neutrino Factory will create a fairly focused beam of neutrinos at one site on the Earth and fire it downwards, probably in two beams emitted in different directions from a racetrack shaped underground muon storage ring, until the beams resurface at other points. One example could be a complex in the UK sending beams to Japan (see Super-Kamiokande) and Italy (LNGS). The properties of the neutrinos will be examined at the remote sites to determine how neutrinos evolve over time. This will provide information about their masses and weak interaction properties.\n\nThe project is currently in the conceptual design stage. An international \"Scoping Study\" was completed in 2007 and an international effort to write a design report has now begun.\n\nMany new technologies are being pioneered for this experiment, including the use of liquid metal jets as a target for pion production, under test in the , the use of Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) accelerators, under test in the EMMA experiment, and liquid hydrogen energy reduction cavities for reducing the divergence in the muon beam during the intermediate stages.\n\nThe International Design Study seeks to present a design report for the Neutrino Factory that details the physics performance, schedule and costs by 2012. The study will include contributions from all regions in a combined Reference Design Report.\n\nThere is a United Kingdom Neutrino Factory group.\n\nIn 2010, the Muon Accelerator Program (MAP) unified the United States Department of Energy research support for Muon Colliders and Neutrino Factories. (Both projects involve producing muons and holding them in a storage ring, so there was much overlap.) The Muon Collider project is even more ambitious than the Neutrino Factory. In the Muon Collider, the muons will be inserted into a very high-energy collider ring, aiming to reach higher concentrations of energy than even the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) (first collisions produced in 2010) or perhaps even the Linear Collider Collaboration (LCC) experiments (design incomplete as of 2019.)\n\nCERN did a design study a few years ago, before effort moved on to the LHC. Activities in Europe continue with meetings and involvement in international experiments and collaborations.\n\nThis is based on an unusual type of accelerator called an Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) that combines elements from the cyclotrons of the 1950s with modern automated magnet design processes, and new magnetic alloy radiofrequency accelerating gaps. The main advantage of these is that the magnetic fields are fixed and do not have to be synchronised to the beam in any way, yet the beam naturally moves into regions of higher field as its energy increases, allowing for very rapid acceleration without the difficulties found in very rapid-cycling synchrotrons.\n\n"}
{"id": "1946755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946755", "title": "All's Lost by Lust", "text": "All's Lost by Lust\n\nAll's Lost by Lust is a Jacobean tragedy by William Rowley. A \"tragedy of remarkable frankness and effectiveness,\" \"crude and fierce,\" it was written between 1618 and 1620.\n\nThe play was first published in 1633 (seven years after Rowley's death), in a quarto published by the bookseller Thomas Harper. This 1633 quarto was the only edition of the play in Rowley's era; the drama would not be reprinted until the nineteenth century.\n\n\"All's Lost by Lust\" was first performed by Rowley's playing company, Prince Charles' Men, and later by the Lady Elizabeth's Men and Queen Henrietta's Men. The play was popular in its own period and was revived during the Restoration; Samuel Pepys saw George Jolly's production at the Red Bull Theatre on 23 March 1661. In his famous Diary, Pepys described the production as \"poorly done\" with \"much disorder\" — when a boy singer performed a song poorly, the music master \"fell about his ears and beat him so, that it put the whole house into an uproar.\"\n\nLike many English Renaissance plays, Rowley's tragedy was adapted for later productions. One \"W. C.\" was responsible for a version called \"The Rape Reveng'd, or the Spanish Revolution\" in 1690. A 1705 adaptation titled \"The Conquest of Spain\" in credited to Mary Pix.\n\nSince then, the work has fallen out of favour and has not been revived.\n\nRowley's reputation as an author is grounded on his comedies; \"All's Lost by Lust\" is his only surviving tragedy. The tragicomic Fitzallen subplot in \"A Fair Quarrel\" and the opening and closing scenes in \"The Changeling\" are other rare examples of the serious side of Rowley's authorship.\n\n\"All's Lost by Lust\" has been classed with other Jacobean tragedies that treat the private crime of rape in a larger political and social context, Including John Fletcher's \"Valentinian\" and \"Bonduca\", and Thomas Middleton's \"Hengist, King of Kent\" and \"The Revenger's Tragedy\", among other works of the era that feature a \"tyrant-rapist\" figure.\n\nRowley's tragedy \"might be called a rape play with a difference.\" Its \"ideological surprises\" include a would-be warrior woman, a \"murderously jealous wife...their conscience-ridden, bigamous husband...and the post mortem \"ménage à trois\" that unites all three. And that is only the sub-plot...\"\n\nThe play's comic relief is supplied largely by the clown character Jaques; the \"Dramatis Personae\" of the 1633 quarto states that Jaques was \"personated by the Poet.\" Rowley had a habit of composing comic roles for himself to play; he wrote and played the clown part of Bustopha in \"The Maid in the Mill\", his late collaboration with Fletcher. The comic parts of Chough in \"A Fair Quarrel\" and Simplicity in \"The World Tossed at Tennis\", two of his collaborations with Thomas Middleton, fall into the same category, as do some other clown roles in other Rowley plays. (Rowley's self-penned roles are recognisable as \"fat clown\" roles, since Rowley was by all evidence a man physically equipped to fill such parts.)\n\nThe play is based on the Spanish legends about the Moorish invasion of Spain in the eighth century. It depicts the tale of Roderick, the last Visigoth king of Spain, and his general Julianus, based on the legendary Julian, count of Ceuta. (Rowley's specific sources for the story are not known, though he had a large body of traditional lore, poems, and ballads on which to base his work.)\n\nAs the play opens, the Moorish invasion of Spain is in the offing; King Roderick musters his army and places it under the command of Julianus. Roderick himself is more interested in seducing the general's daughter Jacinta; his sycophant and pander Lothario brings in an old bawd named Malena to help convince the young woman to yield her virginity. Roderick is also troubled by an empty treasury; he plans to remedy the problem by breaking into an enchanted castle, isolated and secluded by many previous kings, that he believes holds a great treasure.\n\nThe play's second and third scenes introduce the characters of the subplot. Antonio is a young nobleman, infatuated with and courting a young woman named Margaretta. She is a commoner, and Antonio's friend Lazarello complains about the social inequality of the proposed match. Margaretta's father is also uneasy about the match, but her brother, Jaques the clown, is its eager advocate. Antonio marries Margaretta hurriedly before leaving for military duty; the marriage, for the time being, is kept secret.\n\nLothario brings Malena and Jacinta together at Roderick's court, and the old pandress tries her best to make Jacinta pliant, but with no success. Roderick enters, and drags Jacinta offstage to rape her. Julianus, meanwhile, leads his forces south to meet the Moors. He and his officers, including Antonio, stop at the castle of Alonzo; they meet Alonzo's beautiful and extroverted daughter Dionisa. Antonio and Dionisa are instantly attracted to each other, and Antonio comes to regret his hasty marriage to Margaretta. The Spanish forces engage the Moorish invaders and win the battle, capturing many leading Moorish officers; Antonio distinguishes himself by his courage. Lazarello favours a match between Antonio and Dionisa, and advises Antonio on various ways to put aside his secret wife.\n\nLothario keeps Jacinta imprisoned in a castle after her rape; but Jacinta obtains his keys while he sleeps, and escapes. She goes to her father and tells him of her violation. Julianus is overwhelmed by the offence to his family's honour and by his king's betrayal; his officers rally his spirits by staging a review of his troops and the prisoners he has taken, including the Moorish king, Muly Mumen. Julianus tells them of his daughter's rape, and the offended troops agree to support a rebellion against Roderick; Julianus releases Muly Mumen and his men from captivity and the two commanders form an alliance against Roderick.\n\nMargaretta learns of Antonio's betrayal; though a commoner by birth, she is too proud and spirited to accept it. She writes a deceptive letter to her husband, delivered by her brother the clown, that indicates that she will acquiesce to becoming his concubine rather than his wife. Lazarello has a plan to break the connection permanently: he will go to Margaretta in the night in Antonio's place. (This is a reversal of the standard bed trick that is so common in plays of Rowley's era, in which the man rather than the woman is substituted.) Lazarello says that he will not have sex with Margaretta, in deference to Antonio's honour; but after spending the night with her he will be able to claim that he has dishonored her, allowing Antonio an escape from the now-unwanted marriage. Margaretta, however, conspires with her servant Fydella to murder Antonio; on the crucial night, the two women strangle Lazarello with a rope, thinking they are killing Antonio.\n\nThe murder is quickly exposed, though not the confusion of identities. Jaques the clown meets Lothario, who is now in disgrace over his loss of Jacinta; both men plan on hanging themselves. The two have a sort of competition of suicidality; Lothario offers to pay Jaques to hang him, and Jaques, greedy and unsuited to honourable gestures like suicide, accepts the offer.\n\nRoderick breaks into the vault of the supposedly enchanted castle; instead of finding a treasure, he witnesses a macabre spiritual procession that reveals his fate, which is to be defeated by the Moors and to lose his Christian kingdom to the forces of Islam.\n\nTogether, Julianus and Muly Mumen defeat Roderick; but the Moorish king quickly betrays his new ally, blinding Julianus and cutting out Jacinta's tongue. Margaretta meets Dionisa escorting Antonio, who has been wounded in the battle. He dies of his wounds. Dionisa calls Margaretta \"a lusty stout virago,\" and suggests they marry each other and \"beget chimeras.\" Instead, the two women stab themselves over Antonio's body.\n\nMuly Mumen offers the blinded Julianus a chance for revenge, arming the general and letting him attack his tormentor. But his ploy is a cruel joke, in which Julianus stabs his own daughter. She dies in his arms, and he dies of grief. Muly Mumen ends the play by setting off to pursue the fleeing Roderick and consolidate his conquest of the kingdom.\n\nRowley consistently characterizes the Moors as \"black,\" and portrays them as stereotypical villains, bloodthirsty and treacherous. In this he reflects the typical attitudes of his time, as expressed in plays like \"Lust's Dominion\", Peele's \"The Battle of Alcazar\", and Shakespeare's \"Titus Andronicus\" among other works that include Moors and North African Muslims. \n\nRowley modifies the stereotype somewhat in his portrayal of Margaretta's serving maid Fydella, a young Moorish woman who is courageous and fiercely devoted to her mistress, which may in fact be just a depiction of the Author's views that the only good Moor is the one who resigns to be subservient to the Whites, another reflection of racism.\n\n"}

The final took place at the home ground of one of the finalists, rather than a neutral venue.\n\nThe competition was so named thanks to a sponsorship deal with the Watney Mann brewery; the first tournament for English Football League clubs to sell its naming rights. The tournament ran four times, from 1970 to 1973, before being discontinued.\n\nFrom the second season of the competition, the off-side law was applied from the edge of the penalty areas only (instead of the half-way line). This measure was designed to reduce midfield congestion and promote more goals, at a time when defences were becoming much better organised.\n\nThe first ever penalty shootout in England took place in a semi-final of the 1970 tournament between Hull City and Manchester United, and was won by Manchester United. The first footballer to take a kick was George Best, and the first to miss was Denis Law, whose attempt was saved by Hull goalkeeper Ian McKechnie. McKechnie became the first player to miss a deciding kick, when he shot wide after taking the fifth kick for Hull in the shoot-out.\n\n"}

The regalia arrived in Greece in 1835 and was modelled on the regalia of Bavaria but they did not have any precious stones (especially the crown) and thus they resemble funerary European regalia. They were made of precious metals, mainly gold and perhaps partly silver. He established them as the royal regalia of the Crown of Greece but they were not used for a coronation as Otto was never crowned. In 1862 a coup overthrew Otto and the king was forced into exile, as he left returning to Bavaria he took with him the regalia. With his death, they were bequeathed to Prince Leopold, Otto's successor and pretender to the Greek throne.\n\nAlmost a century later, in December 1959, Albrecht, Duke of Bavaria, head of the House of Wittelsbach and descendant of Prince Leopold, sent his son Maximilian-Emmanuel to Athens in order to formally recognize the rights to the throne of the Oldenburg House. The Prince then handed over all the regalia that Otto had taken with him in exile, to King Paul I of Greece.\n"}
{"id": "1946795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946795", "title": "Scorpion II", "text": "Scorpion II\n\nScorpion II (Ancient Egyptian: possibly Selk or Weha), also known as King Scorpion, refers to the second of two kings or chieftains of that name during the Protodynastic Period of Upper Egypt (c. 3200-3000 BC).\n\nKing Scorpion's name and title are of great dispute in modern Egyptology. His name is often introduced by a six- or seven-leafed, golden rosette or flower(?)-sign. This emblem can be found on numerous objects from the Dynasty 0 and Dynasty I periods; it vanishes until the end of the Third Dynasty, when it re-appears under high-ranked officials, such as \"Khabawsokar\" and \"A'a-akhty\" (both dated to the end of the Third Dynasty). Its precise meaning has been intensely discussed; the most common interpretation is that of an emblem meaning 'nomarch' or 'high lord'. During the protodynastic and early dynastic eras, it was evidently used as a designation for kings; in much later periods, it was bestowed on high-ranked officials and princes, especially on those who served as priests for the goddess Seshat. Thus, the golden rosette became an official emblem of Seshat. The reading of the rosette sign is also disputed. Most linguists and Egyptologists read it \"Neb\" (for 'lord') or \"Nesw\" (for 'king'), and they are convinced that the golden rosette was some kind of forerunner to the later \"serekh\".\n\nThe scorpion fetish, which underlies the name of Scorpion II, is generally linked to the later-introduced goddess Selket. But Egyptologists and linguists such as L.D. Morenz, H. Beinlich, Toby Wilkinson and Jan Assmann have pointed out that the goddess was introduced no earlier than the late Old Kingdom period. In this view, the scorpion fetish of the protodynastic period should not be associated with Selket. Morenz points out that, in cases where a fetish animal is included in a ruler's name, the animal generally has a different, rather cultic and political meaning. The scorpion animal commonly stood for dangerous things, such as 'poison' and 'illness', but it could also mean 'bad breath', in military contexts 'storm' and 'attack', or 'gale whiff'. Since it is unclear what actual meaning was reserved for the \"serekh\" animal of Scorpion II, scholars usually refer to him\nas 'King Scorpion II'.\n\nThere are several theories regarding his identity and chronological position. Some Egyptologists, such as Bernadette Menu, argue that, because Egyptian kings of the First Dynasty seem to have had multiple names, Scorpion was the same person as Narmer, simply with an alternative name, or additional title. They also argue that the artistic style seen on the macehead of Scorpion II shows conspicuous similarities to that on the famous Narmer macehead. Other scholars, including T. H. Wilkinson, Renée Friedman and Bruce Trigger, have identified king Scorpion II as the 'Gegenkönig' (opponent ruler) of Narmer and Ka (or \"Sekhen\"). At the time of Scorpion II, Egypt was divided into several minor kingdoms that were fighting each other. It is likewise conjectured that Narmer simply conquered the realms of Ka and Scorpion II, thus unifying the whole of Egypt for the first time.\n\nThe only pictorial evidence of his existence is the so-called Scorpion Macehead, which was found in the Main deposit by archeologists James E. Quibell and Frederick W. Green in a temple at Nekhen (Hierakonpolis) during the dig season of 1897–1898. It is currently on display at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. The stratigraphy of this macehead was lost due to the methods of its excavators, but its style seems to date it to the very end of the Predynastic Period.\n\nThe Scorpion Macehead depicts a single, large figure wearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt. He holds a hoe, which has been interpreted as a ritual either involving the pharaoh ceremonially cutting the first furrow in the fields, or opening the dikes to flood them. The use and placement of the iconography is similar to the depiction of the pharaoh Narmer on the obverse side of the Narmer Palette. The king is preceded by servants, the first in row seems to throw seeds from a basket into the freshly hacked ground. A second servant (his depiction is partially damaged) wears a huge bundle of grain sheafs, which strengthens the interpretation of a seed sowing ceremony, possibly connected to the Sed festival or a founding ceremony. Maybe Scorpion II was the founder of Nekhen or Buto, which would explain why the macehead was found in Hierakonpolis. Above the servants, a row of standard bearers, who carry the same standards as seen on the Narmer palette, precede the king. Below the royal servants, a road and a landscape with people and houses is preserved.\n\nBehind the king (on the left side) two fan bearers follow the king. Left of the fan bearer, bundles of papyrus groves are depicted. Behind these, in the upper section, a group of dancers and a priest are visible; the priest guards a \"Repw.t\"-palanquin. The lower section is lost due to damage. The festive parade looks into the opposite direction of the king and his standard bearers; an outstretched complete view reveals that both processions meet each other in the center of the whole macehead relief scene. In this very center, scholars such as K. M. Ciałowicz, E. J. Baumgärtel and T. H. Wilkinson believe that they see the tiny traces of the feet and the coil of the Red Crown; a second golden rosette is clearly visible. The traces strengthen the presumption that the scene on the Scorpion macehead once contained the depiction of a second figure of the king, wearing the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. In this case, the Scorpion macehead would show king Scorpion II as the ruler of the whole of Egypt.\n\nThe uppermost scene on the macehead shows a row of divine standards. Each standard is surmounted by a god (Set, Min and Nemty, for example) or nome crest. The original number of standards is unknown, but it is clearly visible that one half shows hanged lapwings, the other shows hanged hunting bows. Both standard rows face each other. Lapwings stood for 'Lower Egyptian folks' or 'common folks' and the bows stood for 'folk of archers', pointing to hostile Asian tribes. Their hanging is interpreted as evidence that Scorpion II began the attacks on Lower Egypt and Egyptian enemies at the border lands, which eventually resulted in Narmer's victory and unification of the country.\n\nNumerous small ivory tags showing the depiction of a scorpion were found. They come from Abydos, Minshat Abu Omar and Tarkhan. Some of them show the scorpion holding the hieroglyphic sign for \"nome/garden/land\" (Gardiner sign N24) and it is disputed, if this clear sign combination has a deeper meaning: the scorpion could represent King Scorpion II in his role as a ruler of a certain (but unnamed) nome. Some other tags show the scorpion close over a swallow sign, which reads 'the scorpion is great'. One unique tag shows the scorpion holding a long stick, smiting an enemy. Since many of the tags show a shrine with a heron on the roof at the backsite, it is thought that Scorpion II originated from Buto. \n\nAt Tarkhan and Minshat Abu Omar, several stone- and clay vessels were found. They have royal \"serekhs\" incarved at their bellies and the reading of the name inside is disputed. Several Egyptologists (including Thomas Schneider, Dietrich Wildung and Herman TeVelde) are convinced that the \"serekhs\" present a strongly stylized figure of a scorpion. Others, such as Günter Dreyer and Wolfgang Helck, are not so sure and read it as a sloppily drawn version of the name of King Ka.\n\nAt the second cataract of the Nile, not far from the Nasser-reservoire at Gebel Sheikh Suliman (Sudan), a large rock cutting depicts a big scorpion figure striding over killed enemies. Their death is demonstrated by depicting them standing upside-down and being hit by arrows; two further figures are still holding their own bows and shooting. Thanks to the ostrich feathers and the bows, the enemies can be identified as Nubians, since ostrich feather and bow were the typical attributes for the Egyptians to mark the Nubians. The scorpion faces a human figure with an artificial beard and ceremonial knife in a belt; the figure holds a long cord, to which captured Nubians are tied. The whole scene is interpreted as representing King Scorpion II celebrating his victory against the hostile Nubians.\n\nNumerous artifacts with relief decoration and pottery markings made of black ink point to a flourishing trade economy at the time of Scorpion's rulership. For the first time, the inscriptions give the hieroglyphic writings for 'Lower Egypt' and/or 'Upper Egypt'. Therefore, both parts of Egypt slowly started to work together. But, since it seems clear that Egypt was divided into at least two coexisting kingdoms, scholars wonder on which kind of power factor the rulership of protodynastic kings was based. Conquering and warfare had to be economically promoted, warriors and guardians had to be fed. Based on this cognition, scholars such as K. M Ciałowitz, T. H. Wilkinson, Karl Butzer, and Michael A. Hoffman point to the irrigation systems, which were founded in huge quantities. Numerous palettes (such as the \"Hunters Palette\", the \"Libyan Palette\", and the \"Narmer Palette\", for example) and the maceheads of Scorpion II and Narmer show depictions of rivers, plants, trees and several different animals (birds, mammals, and fishes) in surprising natural detail. Alongside these motifs, human figures performing agricultural work are depicted. Ciałowitz, Wilkinson, Butzer and Hoffman see the power source of the protodynastic kings in these agricultural developments. Irrigation systems allowed increasing settlements, cattle possessions and vegetable cultivation. The scholars wonder if the kings kept the irrigations scarce on purpose, to ensure their power, influence and wealth.\n\nThe numerous decorations on the artifacts also depict large numbers of fetishes and standards, surmounted by gods, which reveals an already very complex religion and cult system. Since the standards often guide the battle scenes, battles and conquests might have been seen as cultic events as well. The earliest recognizable gods are Horus, Seth, Min, Nemty, Nekhbet, Bat, and Wepwawet. But it is unknown where these gods had their cultic centers and shrines, because the hieroglyphs depicting the place names were not introduced yet.\n\nAnother aspect of cultic and religious beliefs under Scorpion II are the numerous depictions of mythical creatures, such as the 'serpopard' and the 'winged chimera'. The \"serpopard\" (also named \"snake neck panther\") appears on the famous \"Narmer palette\" and the so-called \"Two dogs palette\". He was named \"Swdja\", which means \"undestroyable\". In Egyptian mythology the serpopard was described as \"the one who moves the sun\". On the Narmer palette, two serpopards are entwining their necks. This picture is thought to be an allegoric display of the unification of Egypt. Under Scorpion II, two serpopards are lacerating a gazelle, which might imply that the serpopards were under the control of the king (they attack on command).\n\nThe \"winged chimeras\" were named \"Sefer\" in Egyptian and they represent chaos and violence. They appear on the Two-dogs-palette and on several ivory artifacts. Scholars point to the fact that creatures such as the chimera and the serpopards were of Mesopotamian origin.\n\nA further motif of Scorpion's era, that is clearly of Mesopotamian origin, is that of a warrior fighting two lions with his bare hands. He holds one lion in each hand, both at his sides. A similar motif shows the warrior with two giraffes. In later dynasties, this motif became a hieroglyph, registered as Gardiner A38 and Gardiner A39. It reads \"Qjs\" and it was used as the emblem of the city of Cusae.\n\nAll listed motifs and emblems, but also tomb architecture and traded items (such as tools, bead collars and cylinder seals) prove a surprisingly strong and extensive influence of Mesopotamian culture and religion to the early Egyptians. This cognition is promoted by the evaluations of architectural developments, visible at burial places such as Minshat Abu Omar, Hierakonpolis and Naqada. The architectural methods used for building complex and stable tombs were clearly copied from Mesopotamian buildings. It is not fully clarified why the Egyptians fostered their amicable relationship with Mesopotamia so intensively; some scholars believe that the first Egyptian chieftains and rulers were themselves of Mesopotamian origin, but this is still unproven. During the rulership of King Scorpion II and his immediate successors, the influence seems to decrease and Egypt begins to foster its own, more independent culture. This surely was a further important step toward Egypt's future as a powerful and wealthy kingdom.\n\nThe exact burial place of Scorpion II is unknown. There are two tombs that are both seen as candidates. The first one is registered as Tomb B50 and lies at Umm el-Qa'ab (close to Abydos). It is a nearly quadratic chamber divided into four rooms by a simple, cross-shaped mud wall. Several ivory tags with scorpion figures were found here. The second one is located at Hierakonpolis and is registered as Tomb HK6-1. It measures 3.5 m × 6.5 m, has a depth of 2.5 m, and is strengthened with mud. Several ivory tags with scorpion figures were found here.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1913 at the University of Wisconsin, it has over 800,000 members, selected from over 540 collegiate chapters in business schools accredited by AACSB International. Founded in the United States, it has in recent years added collegiate chapters in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, Singapore, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, the Netherlands, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and Chile.\n\nThe purpose of Beta Gamma Sigma is to encourage and honor academic achievement in the study of business and to foster personal and professional excellence among its members. A major emphasis of the society is to foster ethical business leadership. Beta Gamma Sigma members reside in over 160 countries with 27 alumni chapters located in major metropolitan areas in the U.S., Germany, Hong Kong, Spain, Switzerland & Liechtenstein, New Zealand, Peru, London and Toronto. These chapters provide educational and networking opportunities for members.\n\nBeta Gamma Sigma is the largest alumni group in the world for graduates of business programs.\n\nMembership eligibility requirements include that a student must be in the top 10% of a bachelors business program (top 20% for masters programs) and they are inducted toward the end of their degree program, but no earlier than after completion of 50% of the coursework or the last semester of the 3rd (junior) year for those in 4-year bachelor's degrees. Doctoral students are eligible for membership after completing all requirements for the doctoral degree.\n\nThe organization is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies.\n\nBeta is the initial letter of the Greek word BEBAEOS, which signifies honor. Honor is personal integrity and excellence of character. It is an enduring quality found in all persons who deserve to lead others. All honorable persons conscientiously seek to recognize, to uphold, and to encourage that which is ethical and that which is just. Honor is a guiding star which encourages altruism, enlightened social responsibility, and service rather than selfishness.\n\nGamma is the initial letter of the Greek word GNOSIS, which means wisdom. Wisdom is knowledge tested by experience and tempered by discerning judgment. It abhors prejudice, it insists upon freedom of thought and expression. Persons of wisdom constantly seek a better comprehension and more fruitful application of what is known. They are also endlessly engaged in a quest for an understanding of what is unknown. Confronted by a veritable flood of facts and concepts, the person of wisdom exercises special discrimination to select, to arrange, to relate, to interpret, and to apply. This is a challenge worthy of the finest mind.\n\nSigma is the initial letter of the Greek word SPOUDE, which means earnestness. Earnestness is enthusiasm measured by achievement, disciplined by reason and ennobled by sincerity. It is that dynamic quality which is essential for all great achievement. Without Earnestness, both Honor and Wisdom lose much of their potential effectiveness. The greatest personal achievements are tributes to the blending of honor, wisdom and earnestness in the minds and hearts of those who lead. Rewards for the individual and progress for society surely proceed from this wholesome union of qualities.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the former coach of the Bangladesh national cricket team, having been sacked on 8 July 2019 after Bangladesh's poor performance in the Cricket World Cup 2019. He was best known as a wicket-keeper, but was also a useful number six or seven batsman, making twelve first-class centuries.\n\nHis father, William Rhodes, played more than 30 times for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club in the early 1960s.\n\nEmerging initially out of Birstall Cricket Club in West Yorkshire, Rhodes' county cricket career began with Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1981. The incumbent was the international wicket-keeper David Bairstow and after limited chances he moved to Worcestershire County Cricket Club in 1985 staying with that county for the remaining two decades of his playing career.\n\nTowards the end of the 2004 season, Rhodes briefly became county captain following Ben Smith's resignation during the home game with Northamptonshire County Cricket Club.\n\nHe was selected for the England tour to India in 1988/89, but when this was cancelled for political reasons he lost his chance, and it was to be 1994 before he made his Test cricket debut.\n\nHis selection was primarily down to the new chairman of selectors, Ray Illingworth, who announced at his appointment that he wanted balanced sides i.e. an all-rounder at number 6 with a wicket-keeper at number 7. As such, Illingworth was saying that his chosen wicket-keeper had to contribute with bat and gloves. While Rhodes had a golden summer with the gloves in 1994, he did not make enough runs - especially against the powerful South African bowling attack in the second half of the season.\n\nChosen to tour Australia in 1994-95, he had a poor tour with gloves and especially with the bat - frequently dismissed by Australian spearhead Craig McDermott, often leg before wicket (LBW). Having waited so long to make his Test debut (he had played one One Day International in 1989), he was dropped in favour of Alec Stewart in 1995, and never played for England again. Nevertheless, Rhodes was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1994.\n\nIn May 2005, Worcestershire announced that Rhodes had been appointed Coach, following the departure of Tom Moody. He subsequently served as director of cricket between 2006 and 2017.\n\nOn 7 June 2018 Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) appointed Rhodes head coach for the national team until the end of the 2020 ICC World Twenty20. In July 2018 Rhodes lost his first series as Bangladesh coach when West Indies won the two-match Test series 2–0. In the ODI series, Bangladesh defeated West Indies 2–1 and recorded their second ODI series victory in West Indies. Later, Bangladesh managed to beat West Indies in the T20I series with a 2–1 lead. Rhodes praised his team that they made a comeback and won the last two series after they were defeated in the Test series, and he was surprised that they won the T20 series against the world champions West Indies.\n\nIn the last time, Bangladesh have won their first ever tournament final under Rhodes after failing previous 6 times. Tri nation series between Bangladesh, Ireland and West Indies, the Tigers have beaten Windies by 5 Wicket and won the trophy first time ever in their history.\n\nIn July 2019, Rhodes' contract with the BCB was terminated, following the team's eighth-place finish in the 2019 Cricket World Cup.\n\n"}

National Civilian Community Corps teams complete about four different six- to eight-week-long projects during their 10-month term of service. Each team is made up of eight to twelve Corps Members and one Team Leader. Corps Members and Team Leaders are representative of all colors, creeds, states, and economic status. Approximately 1,200 Corps Members and Team Leaders are chosen annually to serve at one of four regional campuses, located in Sacramento, California; Denver, Colorado; Vinton, Iowa; and Vicksburg, Mississippi. Each campus serves as a training center and hub for a multi-state region. Members are required to complete a minimum of 1,700 hours of service, including 80 independent service hours, though members complete an average of 1,850 service hours per term.\n\nIn August 2012, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) partnered to develop FEMA Corps, a new cadre of NCCC members who follow the traditional NCCC model, but serve solely on disaster response and recovery related project through FEMA.\n\nThe mission of the NCCC program is \"To strengthen communities and develop leaders through direct, team-based national and community service.\"\n\nWhile serving in AmeriCorps NCCC, Corps Members receive:\n\nAfter successfully completing a term of service, all AmeriCorps NCCC members are enrolled in the National Service Trust and are eligible to receive a Segal AmeriCorps Education Award. A Segal AmeriCorps Education Award can be used to pay education costs at qualified institutions of higher education, for educational training, or to repay qualified student loans. The award amount for full-time AmeriCorps programs, including NCCC, is currently $5,775 based on the maximum value of the Pell Grant. The award can be accessed in full or in part, and those qualified have seven years after their term of service has ended to claim the award. Individuals can only receive Education Awards for two terms of AmeriCorps service: Full-time, half-time, reduced half-time, quarter time, and minimum time terms of service each count as one term of service.\n\nThe NCCC program was loosely based on the depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), although in practice, the differences between NCCC and CCC projects can be quite marked in both practical intent and outcome. In some respects, NCCC teams resemble their CCC predecessors, who were also required to function under rugged conditions for prolonged periods and engage in strenuous conservation and wildfire-fighting projects, flood control, and disaster relief. Unlike the original CCC, the NCCC was not created to be a public work relief program, but rather was designed to help communities meet self-identified needs through service projects and develop leadership skills in its participants.\n\nIn 1992, \"a bipartisan group of Senators worked hand-in-hand with the first Bush Administration to resurrect the CCC in a new form for a new era, creating what is now as AmeriCorps NCCC\"\n\nWith bipartisan sponsorship, the program was enacted into law in 1993 (referred to as the \"Civilian Community Corps\") and signed by President Bill Clinton as a demonstration program charged with determining:\n\n\nWhile some of the primary motivations cited in the 1993 inception of AmeriCorps NCCC changed and evolved over time, the basic focus of the program has remained the same: environment, education, public safety, and other unmet needs, disaster relief, and the addition of a \"disaster services (preparedness and response)\" heading in 2006/7.\n\nMuch of the Fiscal Year 2006 and 2007 funding issued to NCCC was directly specified as being intended for hurricane relief in the Katrina impacted upper-gulf region. In 2007, in response to budget pressures, the Corporation for National and Community Service announced the closure of the Charleston, SC and Washington, DC campuses. Sixty percent of the remaining NCCC will be deployed to the Gulf Coast to aid with Hurricane Katrina relief until at least 2010.\n\nIn 2008 the National Civilian Community Corps opened a new campus in Vinton, Iowa. This was followed in July 2009 by the opening of a new campus in Vicksburg, Mississippi.\n\nIn 2014, the Mid Atlantic Headquarters moved from the Perry Point VA Medical Center Campus to the Sacred Heart of Mary School in Baltimore County, MD.\n\nIn 2012, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and The Corporation for National and Community Service created FEMA Corps. FEMA Corps, a track of the AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) program, is a national service program dedicated to disaster response and recovery.\n\nFEMA Corps is described as a \"dedicated, trained, and reliable disaster workforce\". Members serve full-time for ten months on federal disaster response and recovery efforts. The first 231 members of the FEMA Corps class were inducted on September 30, 2012. Members serve on teams of 8 to 12 people, and follow the traditional NCCC model of serving, living, and traveling together. Members receive a small living stipend of about of $3,000 ($150.00 every two weeks) over their ten months of service, and housing, food, and transportation costs are covered. Members also receive an education award of at least $5,730 after successfully completing 10 months of service.\n\nBefore starting project work, members go through team building exercises, physical training and special training for the individual jobs they will hold on the team. During this time, members also receive extensive training in first aid/CPR and disaster relief through the Red Cross. They are also trained on how to use different tools and other equipment they might need throughout their projects.\n\nProjects fall into one or more of five areas: disaster response, infrastructure improvement, environmental stewardship and conservation, energy conservation, and urban and rural development. Teams frequently work with non-profit organizations such as Habitat For Humanity and the American Red Cross, tutor students in public schools, and build trails for various national and state parks.\n\nThe National Civilian Community Corps may be called on to respond to any Federal or State disaster including fires, floods, earthquakes, oil spills, mudslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, or terrorist attacks. Americorps NCCC members are routinely attached to the American Red Cross for other disaster relief efforts and trained in Red Cross specific disaster services.\n\nNCCC performs environmental work in a number of areas, usually in collaboration with state and national parks.\n\nNCCC teams have worked in partnership with school systems across the country. A summary of national service work by AmeriCorps NCCC, released in early 2006, states that NCCC had by then tutored 319,000 students.\n\nIn conjunction with the American Council on Education (ACE), NCCC Corps Members who complete course requirements during their year of service can earn undergraduate credits hours for \"Introduction to Service Learning\" and \"Core Supervisory Skills\" (See ACE's \"National Guide Online\").\n\nUpon successful completion of service, NCCC Corps Members earn a (taxable) education award of $5,350 for college tuition—awards that are matched by many colleges and universities.\n\nAll National Civilian Community Corps members are trained in CPR, first aid, and disaster services, and about 15 percent become red-card certified fire fighters.\n\nNCCC teams have successfully served in fighting major wildland fires and in completing fire mitigation work, according to National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service officials.\n\nThe NCCC Summer of Service is an intensive summer program designed to introduce youth ages 14 to 17 to national service and to foster such values as teamwork, responsibility, and the ethic of serving your community. Like the year-round AmeriCorps NCCC experience, NCCC Summer of Service combines the best practices of structured team-based activities with service-learning programming. In 2008, Summer of Service participants engaged in service projects in Los Angeles; Memphis; New Orleans; Sacramento, Denver; Camden, N.J.; Baltimore; Washington, D.C.; and Houston.\n\n\"Since 1994, more than 12,000 members have invested more than 20 million service hours on 6,500 service projects with thousands of nonprofit organizations and other public agencies to provide disaster services, tutor children, preserve the environment, build homes for low-income families and meet other challenges.\nIn FY 2008, 60 percent of members served in the Gulf Coast Region on multiple team deployments assisting local communities to recover from the effects of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike, Dolly, and Wilma.\n\nAmeriCorps NCCC, a team-based residential program for 18–24 year-olds, has made Hurricane Katrina response its primary focus these past three years, deploying more than 4,000 members to intensive assignments in the Gulf. National Civilian Community Corps members have refurbished 9,500 homes, built 1,450 new homes, completed 52,000 damage assessments, and trained and supervised more than 227,000 volunteers.\"\n\nAmeriCorps (which includes the NCCC program) is a US federally funded \"network of more than 3,000 non-profit organizations, public agencies, and faith-based organizations.\" AmeriCorps has met with sharp criticisms from fiscal conservatives who accused it of being a \"boondoggle\", most notably by libertarian James Bovard in a Fox News article that covered proposals to cut funding for the program.\n\n\n"}

Owned and operated by Jackson County's Aviation Authority, the airport serves southwest Oregon. Originally named Medford–Jackson County Airport, it was renamed to Rogue Valley International–Medford Airport after it became an international airport in 1994.\n\nIn December of 2018, the airport celebrated its 1 million+ annual passenger milestone. In doing so Medford joined both PDX and EUG as the only Oregon airports to have surpassed 1 million passengers in a year. By virtue of annual commercial passengers, Rogue Valley International–Medford Airport is the third busiest airport in Oregon with 1,010,920 passenger enplanements and deplanements in 2018 (behind Eugene and Portland). The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a \"primary commercial service\" airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year).\n\nThe airport covers 905 acres (366 ha) at an elevation of 1,335 feet (407 m). Its runway, 14/32, is 8,800 by 150 feet (2,682 x 46 m) asphalt.\n\nThe airport has recently undergone renovations which include a new terminal building with room for expansion, which was completed in 2009 and designed by CSHQA and The Abell Architectural Group Inc. The new terminal has an observation deck on the second floor, a restaurant for screened and unscreened passengers, and second-story loading bridges. Now that the terminal is complete, there is a main concourse, and two open air concourses. A new control tower was completed in late 2008; the $3.6 million, tower uses a state-of-the-art geothermal system to heat and cool the building.\n\nTwo fixed-based operators (FBOs) provide general aviation services on the field: Jet Center MFR, and Million Air (which recently completed its new three-story corporate terminal).\n\nIn 2011 the airport had 42,063 aircraft operations, average 115 per day: 62% general aviation, 25% air taxi, 12% airline, and 1% military. 215 aircraft were then based at this airport: 67% single-engine, 14% jet, 10% multi-engine, 4% glider, and 4% helicopter.\n\nThe Medford airport continues to post favorable passenger statistics; following monthly gains in 2019 the facility served 1,087,873 arriving and departing passengers (increase of 7.6% over 2018 statistic).\n\nHorizon Air operates Bombardier Q400s on all of their flights at Rogue Valley International–Medford Airport, with nonstops to Portland International Airport and Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. Nonstops to Denver International Airport and San Francisco International Airport, flown by SkyWest Airlines operating as United Express, use Canadair CRJ-700 and ERJ-175 regional jets as well as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737-900 for select San Francisco and Denver flights. United Express also operates Canadair CRJ-200 regional jets nonstop to Denver. Delta Connection, operated by Compass Airlines, flies nonstop to Salt Lake City International Airport and Seattle–Tacoma International Airport with ERJ-175s. Allegiant Air flies nonstop to Las Vegas and Los Angeles, and seasonally to Phoenix–Mesa Gateway Airport, using the Airbus A319.\n\nMedford was served by United Airlines Boeing 727-200s and 737-200s, by Hughes Airwest (formerly Air West) Douglas DC-9-10s and DC-9-30s, by Pacific Express BAC One-Elevens, and by Pacific Southwest Airlines BAe 146-200s. The PSA service was continued by USAir (later renamed US Airways) after it acquired PSA. USAir later ended service to Medford though US Airways Express did serve Medford later with regional jets. The predecessor of Air West and Hughes Airwest, West Coast Airlines, served the airport in the 1960s with Douglas DC-9s and Fairchild F-27s. West Coast merged with Pacific Air Lines and Bonanza Air Lines to form Air West. In the late 1980s and early 1990s United Express operated as NPA, West Air and Mesa flying British Aerospace Jetstreams (19 seat turboprops) directly to both Portland and Seattle\n\nOn January 7, 2008, a US Airways Express jet arriving from Las Vegas struck a coyote, killing the coyote. No passenger injuries occurred, and possibly no passenger noticed the collision.\n\n"}
{"id": "1946883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946883", "title": "Playing company", "text": "Playing company\n\nIn Renaissance London, playing company was the usual term for a company of actors. These companies were organized around a group of ten or so shareholders (or \"sharers\"), who performed in the plays but were also responsible for management. The sharers employed \"hired men\" that is, the minor actors and the workers behind the scenes. The major companies were based at specific theatres in London; the most successful of them, William Shakespeare's company the King's Men, had the open-air Globe Theatre for summer seasons and the enclosed Blackfriars Theatre in the winters. The Admiral's Men occupied the Rose Theatre in the 1590s, and the Fortune Theatre in the early 17th century.\n\nLess fortunate companies spent most of their existences touring the provinces; when Worcester's Men gained official permission to perform in London in 1602, they were, in a manner of speaking, \"coming in from the cold\" of a life of constant touring.\n\nThe development of theatre in England in the 16th and 17th centuries was not an isolated phenomenon; similar developments occurred simultaneously in other European countries, to greater or lesser degrees. The same broad factors influenced English actors as those that affected actors in neighboring countries, especially Scotland, France, Denmark, and states in northern Germany like Saxony and the Rhineland Palatinate. Yet conditions in other societies also differed significantly from those in England; the following discussion applies specifically to England in the 16th century and 17th century.\n\nIn the later Medieval and early Renaissance periods, wealthy and powerful English noble houses sometimes maintained a troupe of half a dozen \"players\", just as noblemen kept jesters or jugglers for entertainment. English theatre benefited greatly from the predilection for theatricality displayed by the Tudors. Henry VII kept a company of players called the \"Lusores Regis\", which probably consisted of four men and a boy who were used to swift costume changes and multiple roles. In the early period the difference between players, acrobats and other entertainers was not hard and fast. A troupe of players, however, was more costly to keep than a jester; players (who usually had other household duties as well) could defray expenses by touring to various cities and performing for profit a practice that began the evolution away from the medieval model of noble patronage and toward the commercial and capitalistic model of modern entertainment. It is from the scattered records of such touring, and from occasional performances at the English Royal Court, that our very limited knowledge of English Renaissance theatre in the early and middle 16th century derives.\n\nOne curious development of this era was the development of companies of pre-pubescent boy actors. The use of the boy player in companies of adult actors to play female parts can be traced far back in the history of medieval theatre, in the famous mystery plays and moralities; the employment of casts of boys for entire dramatic productions began in the early 16th century, which utilized the boys' choirs connected with cathedrals, churches, and schools. In time the practice took on a professional aspect and companies of child actors would play an important role in the development of drama through the Elizabethan era and into the Jacobean and Caroline periods that followed. (See: Children of the Chapel; Children of Paul's; Beeston's Boys; King's Revels Children.)\n\nThe playing companies did not need to spend money on scenery, and their stage props were often basic (necessarily, since every company made a substantial portion of its income by touring, and some companies toured consistently with no home theatre). Their costs in costumes, however, were high: actors playing kings, cardinals, princes, and noblemen had to look the part. Companies had hundreds of pounds of value invested in their costumes, in \"glaring satin suits\" and \"sumptuous dresses\" \"cloaks in scarlet with gold laces and buttons, and in purple satin adorned with silver;\" doublets of \"carnation velvet, flame, ginger, red and green; and women's gowns in white satin and cloth of gold.\" In 1605, Edward Alleyn estimated that his share in the \"apparell\" of the Admiral's Men was worth £100 and Alleyn was one of nine sharers in the company at the time. When a company got itself into financial difficulties, the members sometimes had to pawn their costumes, as Pembroke's Men did in the plague year of 1593.\n\nIn 1605 the actor Augustine Phillips left specific pieces of his wardrobe to an apprentice in his last will and testament including his \"mouse-colored\" velvet hose, purple cloak, white taffeta doublet, and black taffeta suit. To a modern sensibility, this may sound quaint and odd; but when \"a doublet and hose of seawater green satin cost £3\", the monetary value of Phillips' items was not negligible. Actors could face serious penalties for appropriating the costumes of their companies. [See Robert Dawes for an example.] (The players could defray some of their costs in the used clothing market. As an example, the King's Men bought discarded items of Gondomar's wardrobe for the actor playing the Black Knight in \"A Game at Chess\". Often, \"eminent lords and knights at their decease\" would leave articles of their finery to their servants much of it \"unseemly\" for servingmen and women to wear. Such garments would end up the property of the actors.)\n\nA second major cost lay in play scripts. In the years around 1600, playwrights could be paid as little as £6 to £7 per play (or about the price of two suits). Yet since the companies acted a constantly changing repertory, they needed an abundant supply of plays. Philip Henslowe's Diary records dozens of titles for the 1597–1603 period; when Worcester's Men were setting up for their first London season in 1602, they purchased a dozen new plays from Henslowe's stable of house playwrights, to supplement their existing stock.\n\nThe sharers in the company also paid wages to their hired men and boys. Wages differed somewhat over time and from company to company and case to case; but the general average minimum was 1 shilling per man per day, the same wage as that of an artisan worker. Boys cost perhaps half as much, though they were often maintained under some version of an apprenticeship arrangement, which could vary widely in details.\n\nPerformances at the public theatres were generally allowed six days per week; the theatres were closed on Sundays and major religious holidays like Good Friday. Other restrictions were laid upon the players, some of which they evaded as consistently as they could. They were supposed to cease playing entirely during Lent but violated this stricture regularly. In the spring of 1592, for example, the Lord Strange's Men played daily at the Rose Theatre right through Lent. After 1623, companies circumvented the Lenten restriction through the simple expedient of paying bribes to Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels.\n\nOne restriction that the players observed, one that was too serious to violate, was the prohibition enforced whenever bubonic plague rose from endemic to epidemic levels. Through much of the English Renaissance period, the theatres were shut down when the death figures in the plague bill (the weekly mortality report for London and some suburban parishes) rose above a certain level. In 1604 that cut-off number was set at 30 per week; in 1607 it was raised to 40. A serious epidemic closed the theatres almost entirely from June 1592 through April 1594; 11,000 Londoners died of plague in 1593. (The plague tended to abate in the colder weather of winter; the theatres opened for short seasons during the winter months of those years.) 1603 was another bad plague year, with 30,000 deaths in London; the theatres were closed from March 1603 to perhaps April 1604. \n\nOther serious epidemics caused theatre closures in 1625 (for eight months, to October) and from May 1636 to October 1637. These periods of closure were always traumatically difficult for the acting troupes; some survived by touring cities and towns outside London...and some didn't survive at all.\n\nThe explosion of popular drama that began when James Burbage built the first fixed and permanent venue for drama, The Theatre, in 1576 was the one great step away from the medieval organizational model and toward the commercial theatre; but that evolution was, at best, a \"work in progress\" throughout the English Renaissance. Throughout this period, troupes of actors needed to maintain the patronage of a noble household. The prevailing legal system in England defined \"masterless men\" who traveled about the country as vagabonds, and subjected them to treatments of varying harshness. Local authorities tended to be more hostile than welcoming toward players; the Corporation of London, from the Lord Mayor and aldermen down, was famously hostile to acting troupes, as were the Puritans. Noble patronage was, at the very least, the legal fig leaf that allowed professional players to function in society.\n\nIn some cases, more so toward the end of the period, noble patronage was nothing more than that legal fig leaf; a company of actors was an independent entity, financially and otherwise. Conversely, some noblemen were beneficent patrons of their players. The Lords Hunsdon Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon (c. 1524–96), and his son George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon (1547–1603) were valuable protectors of their own company, and, when they served in the office of Lord Chamberlain (1585–96 and 1597–1603 respectively), of English drama as a whole.\n\nThat company of Hunsdon's, known to posterity as The Lord Chamberlain's Men, was organized somewhat like a modern joint-stock commercial company (the concept of which was just beginning to evolve in this era) at its re-formation in 1594, after the long plague closure. The company had a small number of partners or shareholders, who pooled their funds to pay expenses and in turn shared the profits, in what was largely a de facto democratic way (at least for the sharers, if not for the hired men and apprentices they employed). Their main rivals, the Admiral's Men, suffered in contrast under a less ideal version of capitalist organization: Philip Henslowe functioned more like a blend of big-business autocrat, landlord, and loan shark. He managed multiple companies of actors and built and owned several theatres, and controlled players (sharers included) and playwrights by doling out payments and loans. (The silver lining in this cloud is that Henslowe's surviving financial records provide a wealth of detailed knowledge about the theatre conditions in his era that is unparalleled by any other source.) Other companies varied between these extremes of organization. (Francis Langley, builder of the Swan Theatre, operated much as Henslowe did, though less successfully, and for a shorter time.) \n\nDrama in the age of Elizabeth was at best an organized disorder; suppression of individual companies, and even the profession as a whole, for political reasons was not unknown. [See: \"The Isle of Dogs\".] Local residents sometimes opposed theatres in their neighborhoods. Individual companies of actors struggled and failed and recombined; tracking the changes has been the obsession of scholars and the bane of students. \n\nYet the drama was also enormously popular, from the Queen and Court down to the commonest of the common people; indeed, the odd polarity of the theatre audience in this period, with the High and the Low favoring the drama, and the middle class generally more hostile with the growth of Puritan sentiments, is a surprising and intriguing phenomenon. Theatres proliferated, especially (though not exclusively) in neighborhoods outside the city's walls and the Corporation's control in Shoreditch to the north, or the Bankside and Paris Garden in Southwark, on the southern bank of the River Thames: the Curtain, the Rose, the Swan, the Fortune, the Globe, the Blackfrairs a famous roster.\n\nKing James, \"VI and I\", was passionately fond of drama; and theatrical activity at Court accelerated from the start of his reign. Consider the following figures.\n\nIn roughly the last decade of Elizabeth's reign, 1594–1603, there were 64 theatrical performances at Court, for an average of 6 or 7 a year:\n\nCompare a total of 299 for a somewhat longer period in the first portion of James' reign, 1603–16, an average of more than 20 per year:\n\nThe major companies acquired royal patronage: the Lord Chamberlain's Men became the King's Men, and the Admiral's Men became Prince Henry's Men, under the patronage of the King's eldest son. A company of Queen Anne's Men was built out of the pre-existent Oxford's and Pembroke's Men, companies that were largely devoted to touring the provinces in the previous reign. In 1608 a company was organized under the title of the King's second son, the eight-year-old Charles; this company, the Duke of York's Men, was called Prince Charles's Men after Prince Henry unexpectedly died in 1612.\n\nCompanies continued to form, evolve, and dissolve in the early Jacobean era the King's Revels Children, the Lady Elizabeth's Men; but by the midpoint of James' reign, around the time of Shakespeare's death in 1616, the dramatic scene had generally stabilized into four important companies. These were: the King's Men, at the Globe and Blackfriars Theatres; Palsgrave's Men (formerly the Admiral's and Prince Henry's Men), at the Fortune; Prince Charles's Men, at the Hope; and Queen Anne's Men, at the Red Bull Theatre.\n\nTheatrical evolution continued, sometimes tied to the lives and deaths of royal patrons. Queen Anne's Men disbanded with the death of Anne of Denmark in 1619; the accession of a new queen in 1625 saw the creation of Queen Henrietta's Men. Occasionally there were other new companies like Beeston's Boys, and new theatres like the Salisbury Court. The two prolonged closings of the London theatres due to plague, in 1625 and 1636–37, caused significant disruption in the acting profession, with companies breaking apart, combining and re-combining, and switching theatres, in a dizzying confusion. (Only the King's Men were exempt.) Political suppressions also came along in the Stuart era, though they affected only single offending companies until a general political suppression closed the theatres from 1642 to 1660, and brought the age of English Renaissance theatre to its end.\n\n"}

The Assyrians called them \"Gimmerai\"; the Cimmerian king Teushpa was defeated by Assarhadon of Assyria sometime between 681 and 668 BC.\n\nJosephus placed Gomer and the \"Gomerites\" in Anatolian Galatia: \"For Gomer founded those whom the Greeks now call Galatians, but were then called Gomerites.\" Galatia in fact takes its name from the ancient Gauls (Celts) who settled there. However, the later Christian writer Hippolytus of Rome in c. 234 assigned Gomer as the ancestor of the Cappadocians, neighbours of the Galatians. Jerome (c. 390) and Isidore of Seville (c. 600) followed Josephus' identification of Gomer with the Galatians, Gauls and Celts.\n\nAccording to tractate Yoma, in the Talmud, Gomer is identified as \"Germamya\".\n\nIn Islamic folklore, the Persian historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (c. 915) recounts a Persian tradition that Gomer lived to the age of 1000, noting that this record equalled that of Nimrod, but was unsurpassed by anyone else mentioned in the Torah.\n\nThe Cimbri were a tribe settled on Jutland peninsula in Germania (now Denmark) ca. 200 BC, who were variously identified in ancient times as Cimmerian, Germanic or Celtic. In later times, some scholars connected them with the Welsh people, and descendants of Gomer. Among the first authors to identify Gomer, the Cimmerians, and Cimbri, with the Welsh name for themselves, \"Cymri\", was the English antiquarian William Camden in his \"Britannia\" (first published in 1586). In his 1716 book \"Drych y Prif Oesoedd\", Welsh antiquary Theophilus Evans also posited that the Welsh were descended from the Cimmerians and from Gomer; this was followed by a number of later writers of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThis etymology is considered false by modern Celtic linguists, who follow the etymology proposed by Johann Kaspar Zeuss in 1853, which derives \"Cymry\" from the Brythonic word *\"Combrogos\" (\"fellow countryman\"). The name Gomer (as in the pen-name of 19th century editor and author Joseph Harris, for instance) and its (modern) Welsh derivatives, such as \"Gomeraeg\" (as an alternative name for the Welsh language) became fashionable for a time in Wales, but the Gomerian theory itself has long since been discredited as an antiquarian hypothesis with no historical or linguistic validity.\n\nIn 1498 Annio da Viterbo published fragments known as \"Pseudo-Berossus\", now considered a forgery, claiming that Babylonian records had shown that \"Comerus Gallus\", i.e. Gomer son of Japheth, had first settled in Comera (now Italy) in the 10th year of Nimrod following the dispersion of peoples. In addition, Tuiscon, whom \"Pseudo-Berossus\" calls the fourth son of Noah, and says ruled first in Germany/Scythia, was identified by later historians (e.g. Johannes Aventinus) as none other than Ashkenaz, Gomer's son.\n\nThree sons of Gomer are mentioned in Genesis 10, namely\n\n\nChildren of Ashkenaz was originally identified with the Scythians (Assyrian \"Ishkuza\"), then after the 11th century, with Germany. \n\nAncient Armenian and Georgian chronicles lists Togarmah as the ancestor of both people who originally inhabited the land between two Black and Caspian Seas and between two inaccessible mountains, Mount Elbrus and Mount Ararat respectively.\n\nAccording to Khazar records, Togarmah is regarded as the ancestor of the Turkic-speaking peoples.\n\n"}

He has been the Executive Vice-President of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise since 1984. He writes frequently on natural resource issues and is an opponent of the environmental movement. Critics see Arnold as promoting abuse of the environment, typified in an assessment by Wild Wilderness executive director Scott Silver: \"Fifteen years after creating his 25 Point Wise-Use Agenda, an agenda prescribing unrestrained, unregulated and unconscionable abuse of the American commons, Ron Arnold is within striking distance of checking off every agenda item on his list.\" A key U.S. Senate staffer writing in 2011 noted his impact on federal legislation.\n\nArnold was born in Houston, Texas and studied business administration at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Washington.\n\nArnold worked as a technical writer for the Boeing Company from 1961 until he left in 1971 to found Northwoods Studio. In 1974 he began contributing to \"Western Conservation Journal\", which exposed him to the effects of litigation related to environmental issues upon logging and mining industries. Between 1978 and 1981, Arnold was a contributing editor of \"Logging Management Journal\". His 1979 magazine series, \"The Environmental Battle\", analyzed the utilization / preservation conflict, and won the American Business Press 1980 Editorial Achievement Award.\n\nIn 1981, Arnold wrote the authorized biography of Interior Secretary James G. Watt. Between 1982 and 1990, he wrote a weekly column for the Bellevue (Washington) Journal-American. In 1987, he founded the Free Enterprise Press, later merged into Merril Press, and began writing a series of books on the environmental movement. His \"EcoTerror\" was included in the \"100 Best Nonfiction Books of the 20th Century\" Random House / Modern Library Reader's List.\n\nArnold also uncovered the identity of the actual founder of the United States National Forest after a century of mystery shrouded the origin in conflicting claims. An almost forgotten politician named William S. Holman created the concept and the initial legislation, as revealed in documents Arnold discovered in the National Archives. He was invited to present his findings at the centennial symposium of the United States Forest Service in 1991.\n\nEnvironmentalists have challenged Arnold's “Wise Use Movement,” launched at a Reno, Nevada conference in 1988, as inappropriately co-opting the term from utilitarian conservationist and first Chief of the U.S. Forest Service, Gifford Pinchot, who held different views on man and nature than Arnold and his movement. Arnold readily admits the borrowing, but disputes arguments that it is improper, a controversy that continues unresolved.\n\nHe has mobilized political allies to protests, as covered by ABC News Nightline (broadcast February 24, 1994) by using case histories of environmentalist excesses in influencing policymakers to adopt his ideas. Certain policies of President George W. Bush]] have been attributed to Arnold's influence. Playboy magazine's May 2004 issue featured a profile of Arnold in the Playboy Forum, by reporter Dean Kuypers. Titled, \"Guru of Wise Use,\" its headline read: \"The spiritual father of the Bush administration's environmental policies says we shouldn't be timid about timber.\"\nArnold has built a network of academic colleagues to help analyze large-scale social movements, and told the Boston Globe that environmentalism is \"the third great wave of messianism to hit the planet, after Christianity and Marxism-Leninism.\" The Globe commented, \"'Wise users' charge that the environmental crisis has been largely trumped up as an excuse to take control of the nation's natural resources.\"\nArnold's conclusion that movements of social change, including environmentalism, are fundamentally a kind of war was examined and found valid by sociologist Luther P. Gerlach in the RAND research document, \"Networks and Netwars.\"\nArnold runs the Left Tracking Library, a site that tracks what it claims to be undue influence by left-wing politicians and environmentalists.\n\nIn late 2010, Arnold began writing a weekly column for The Washington Examiner; one was placed in the Congressional Record in early 2011. Another was used as source material by Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) in a Senate confirmation hearing in December 2013.\n\n\n\n"}

Speaking of the album, Eno said, \"\"The first one I've done like that for a very long time...25 years or so\"\". In addition, he explained his current thoughts on lyrics in music; \"\"Song-writing is now actually the most difficult challenge in music\",\" he confessed.\n\nEno recorded and mixed most of the album on a Mac, using Logic, over a period of four years. He also engineered it himself, \"\"because otherwise I would have had to spend six years in a commercial studio and pay staff, and that would have become too expensive\"\".\n\n\"Bottomliners\" and \"Under\" were first worked on about six years previously, on a DA88, the latter songs' drumming being supplied by Willie Green. On the former, and on the ballad \"And Then So Clear\" he pitch-shifted his voice up an octave, using the gender-changing function on a Digitech Pro Vocalist creating a vocoder-like effect. His studio features a selection of hardware including a Lexicon Jam Man loop sampler and an Eventide H3000 Harmonizer.\n\nThe album is actually built around the \"And Then So Clear\" song. He says \"... In one day, actually, I pretty much finished it ... I liked it so much, and I thought, how I am going release this song, and I thought, I have to write some others.\"\n\nOn the title track he repeatedly cut up the main phrase, so that \"the listener had little windows on it.\" Similar \"cut-up\" methodologies were used for the lyrics of \"This,\" in that he used his computer to generate some of the words.\n\n\"Under\" is a nearly-identical version of a song that was on the unreleased 1991 album My Squelchy Life, which was released in 2014 as a bonus disc with a reissue of Eno's 1992 Nerve Net.

She took part in the battles of the French Revolutionary Wars in the Brest squadron, served in the Caribbean in 1803, and duelled with HMS \"Victory\" during the Battle of Trafalgar, killing Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson during the action. She sank in the storm that followed the battle.\n\nBuilt as \"Suffren\", the ship was commissioned in the Brest squadron of the French fleet. After her crew took part in the Quibéron mutinies, she was renamed to \"Redoutable\". She took part in the Croisière du Grand Hiver, the Battle of Groix, and the Expédition d'Irlande. At the Peace of Amiens, \"Redoutable\" was sent to the Caribbean for the Saint-Domingue expedition, ferrying troops to Guadeloupe and Haiti.\n\nLater, she served in the fleet under Vice-admiral Villeneuve, and took part in the Trafalgar Campaign. At the Battle of Trafalgar, \"Redoutable\" rushed to cover the flagship \"Bucentaure\" when the ship following her failed to maintain the line. She tried in vain to stop Nelson's HMS \"Victory\" from breaking the line and raking \"Bucentaure\", and then engaged her with furious cannon and small arms fire that silenced the British flagship and killed Nelson. As her crew prepared to board \"Victory\", HMS \"Temeraire\" raked her with grapeshot, killing or maiming most of her crew. \"Redoutable\" continued to fight until she was in danger of sinking before striking her colours. She foundered in the storm of 22 October.\n\nThe ship was laid down at Brest in January 1790, and launched as \"Suffren\" on 31 May 1791. She was the first ship of the French Navy named in honour of Vice-admiral Suffren de Saint Tropez, who had died a hero of the American War of Independence on 8 December 1788. She was completed there in December 1792.\n\n\"Suffren\" was attached to the Brest fleet under Vice-admiral de Grimouard, later replaced by Morard de Galles. Under Captain Obet, she departed Brest in 1793 for a cruise to Quibéron. In September, the crews of the fleet revolted in the Quibéron mutinies, including the crew of \"Suffren\".\n\nIn retaliation, \"Suffren\" was renamed \"Redoutable\" on 20 May 1794. The same day, she received the new naval flag of the Republic, the full tricolour which replaced the white flag with a tricolour canton, and hoisted her.\n\nFrom March to June 1794, \"Redoutable\", under Captain Dorré, was the flagship of the naval station of Cancale. The division of Cancale was under Dorré, and was composed of \"Redoutable\" and her sister-ship \"Nestor\", under Captain Monnier.\n\nIn December, she took part in the Croisière du Grand Hiver under Captain Moncousu; upon departure, she broke her cables, but unlike the ill-fated \"Républicain\", she managed to reach the open sea, followed by the frigate \"Vertu\". However, the damage sustained in the incident forced her to cancel her departure, and she returned to Brest.\n\nIn February 1795, \"Redoutable\" was the flagship of a division under Rear-admiral Kerguelen within the fleet of Brest, under Villaret-Joyeuse. Still under Captain Moncousu and with Commander Bourayne as first officer, she took part in the Battle of Groix on 23 June 1795, where her poor sailing properties compelled the frigate \"Virginie\", under Captain Bergeret, to take her in tow. During the battle, she was one of the few ships of observe Villaret's orders to support \"Alexandre\". Later, along with \"Tigre\", she attempted to support \"Formidable\", but to no avail as \"Formidable\"s tops caught fire and she ceased all resistance to save herself, eventually striking her colours. After the battle, she sailed back to Port-Louis, near Lorient,\n\nIn December 1796, \"Redoutable\" took part in the Expédition d'Irlande under Moncousu, by then promoted to Rear-admiral, and was the first French ship to reach Bantry Bay, after rallying elements of the French fleet. In the night of 22 to 23 December, she accidentally collided with Nielly's flagship, the frigate \"Résolue\", dismasting her of her bowsprit, foremast, and mizzen; only her mainmast stayed upright. the 74-gun \"Pégase\" took \"Résolue\" in tow and returned with her to Brest, where they arrived on 30 December; \"Redoutable\" eventually limped back to Brest, where she arrived on 5 January 1797, in consort with \"Fougueux\", \" Trajan\", \"Neptune\" and \"Tourville\", and four frigates.\n\nIn March 1802, the \"Redoutable\" was the flagship of a squadron of two ships of the line and four frigates under Admiral Bouvet sent to reinforce Guadeloupe in 1802 and in the Saint-Domingue expedition in 1803, departing on 9 January from Ajaccio with troops and arriving on 4 February.\n\nIn 1803, \"Redoutable\", under Captain Siméon, was part of a naval division under Rear-admiral Bedout, based in Saint-Domingue. The division was composed of the 74-gun \"Argonaute\" as flagship, with Captain Bourdé as Bedout's flag officer; the 74-guns \"Redoutable\" and \"Aigle\", under Captain Gourrège; the frigate \"Vertu\", under Commander Montalan; and the corvettes \"Serpente\", under Commander Gallier-Labrosse, and \"Éole\", under Lieutenant Descorches.\n\nAt the Battle of Trafalgar, on 21 October 1805, \"Redoutable\" was commanded by Captain Lucas, with Lieutenant Dupotet as first officer. \"Redoutable\" was the third ship behind the flagship \"Bucentaure\" in the French line, coming behind Maistral's \"Neptune\" and Quevedo's \"San Leandro\". When \"Neptune\" and \"San Leandro\" dropped behind \"Bucentaure\", exposing her stern, \"Redoutable\" rushed to cover her and prevent Nelson's \"Victory\" from cutting the Franco-Spanish line of battle.\n\nWith her bowsprit almost touching \"Bucentaure\" stern, \"Redoutable\" fired on \"Victory\"s rigging for ten minutes, trying to disable her to prevent the crossing of the French line, but did not manage to stop her advance, despite cutting off her foremast tops, her mizzen and her main topgallant, and ended up running afoul of her. A furious, fifteen-minute musket duel erupted between the two ships; the crew of \"Redoutable\" had been especially trained by Lucas for such an occasion, and soon the heavy hand-grenade and small-arms fire on \"Victory\"s quarterdeck mortally wounded Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson. Lucas later reported:\n\nThe French crew were about to board \"Victory\" when \"Temeraire\" intervened, firing on the exposed French crew at point blank range, killing or wounding 200 men, including Lucas and Dupotet, struck by a bullet to the knee, who nevertheless remained at their stations. The crew of \"Redoutable\" rushed to man her artillery and engage \"Temeraire\" with her starboard battery, Soon, \"Tonnant\" took a position at stern of \"Redoutable\", which thus found herself fired upon from three larger ships. In the ensuing cannonade, \"Redoutable\" lost most of her artillery, including two guns that burst, killing several gunners. \"Temeraire\" hailed for \"Redoutable\" to surrender, but Lucas had volley of musketry fired for replies.\n\nAt 1.55 pm, \"Redoutable\", with Lucas severely wounded, and only 99 men still fit out of 643 (300 dead and 222 severely wounded), was essentially defenceless. The \"Fougueux\" attempted to come to her aid but came afoul of \"Temeraire\". After ascertaining that \"Redoutable\" was too damaged to survive the aftermath of the battle, and worried that she would sink before his wounded could be evacuated, Lucas struck his colours at 2:30. \"Redoutable\"s aft featured a large opening and was in danger of collapsing, her rudder was shot off, and the hull was pierced in many spots.\n\nBeing much damaged and weakened by the fight themselves, the British ships took some time to take possession of \"Redoutable\", and Lucas had to request urgent assistance to pump water, as four of \"Redoutable\"s pumps were destroyed and few of her crewmen could man them.\n\n\"Redoutable\" was freed from the rigging of \"Temeraire\" around 7 in the evening and was taken in tow by \"Swiftsure\". The next day, \"Redoutable\" made distress signals, and \"Swiftsure\" launched boats to evacuate her passengers; she foundered around 7, taking 196 men with her. Lucas reported:\n\"Victory\" had sustained 160 casualties, and \"Temeraire\" 120. Of \"Redoutable\"s crew, 169 were taken on board \"Swiftsure\"; the wounded were sent to Cadiz on a cartel, and 35 men were taken prisoner to England.\n\nLucas was received in England with great courtesy. After his release from capture, he was personally awarded the rank of Commandeur of the Legion of Honour by Napoleon for his role during the battle.\n\n\n"}

The organisation was established to improve the social and economic well-being of those who had previously had negative experiences with the secondary education system. As a Māori-led organisation grounded in Māori values, Te Wānanga o Aotearoa is committed to the revitalisation of Māori cultural knowledge. It is also focused on breaking inter-generational cycles of non-participation in tertiary education to reduce poverty and eliminate associated social issues. The organisation works towards ‘whānau transformation through education'.\n\nTe Wānanga o Aotearoa is currently one of the largest public tertiary education institutions in the nation.\n\nTe Wānanga o Aotearoa was founded in 1983 to provide training and education for those whose needs were not being met by the mainstream education system. The genesis of what would become Te Wānanga o Aotearoa emerged as the brainchild of Te Awamutu College board of governors' member Rongo Wetere and Māori Studies teacher Iwi Kohuru (Boy) Mangu. The two men wanted to provide a ‘marae of learning' as an educational alternative for the large number of predominantly Māori students being expelled from Te Awamutu College.\n\nTheir solution was to lead a group of these students to create a wharenui on the college's grounds. The two men were joined in their endeavours by tohunga whakairo (master carvers) Pakariki Harrison and Mac Bell) and tohunga raranga (master weaver) Hinemoa Harrison. The resulting structure, \"O-Tāwhao Marae\", was opened on 26 April 1985 and is still used to introduce students to \"te ao Māori\" (the world of Māori). Although the project encountered resistance at the time, O-Tāwhao is now recognised as an invaluable resource for the college and Te Awamutu community.\n\nIn 1984, Mr Wetere led a project to create the \"Waipā Kōkiri Arts Centre\". The centre would provide further educational opportunities for the students who were involved in the O-Tāwhao Marae project and engage others in the community who had no qualifications. The aim was to provide these people with a future beyond the unemployment queues. Although some government funding was available, further fundraising and, in some cases, personal loans from founders were needed to complete the centre. On completion of the centre, new government funding became available that enabled the Waipā Kōkiri Arts Centre to expand its programme portfolio. Office administration, computer technology studies and trades training programmes in building and plumbing were added to the whakairo (carving), raranga (weaving) and Te reo Māori programmes already running. The centre also became involved in community projects, including renovating marae throughout the country and producing carving and weaving to adorn these buildings.\n\nDuring the 1980s (a time of high unemployment in Aotearoa New Zealand), the kaupapa (philosophy) of the Waipā Kōkiri Arts Centre was to increase Māori participation in tertiary training by taking education to the people, particularly those without qualifications. With travel a major barrier for many, the founders began opening campuses in other areas, including Te Kuiti, Hamilton and Manukau.\n\nIn 1987, Buck Nin (a leading New Zealand educationalist and artist) and Mr Wetere advanced the concept of creating a tertiary education institute, or wānanga. Dr Nin believed that, by gaining tertiary status, Aotearoa Institute would earn recognition for its qualifications throughout Aotearoa New Zealand and the world. In 1988, the pair submitted an application to the Ministry of Education and the following year the government changed the Education Act to open the way for recognition of wānanga as tertiary education institutions. The same year (1989), Waipā Kōkiri Arts Centre changed its name to Aotearoa Institute and shortly afterwards became the first registered private training establishment (under NZQA) in the country.\n\nThe Aotearoa Institute lobbied government for a further five years before being granted tertiary status in 1993. This gave the organisation statutory recognition as a wānanga and placed it alongside universities, polytechnics and teachers' training colleges. In 1994, Aotearoa Institute changed its name to Te Wānanga o Aotearoa to reflect this change in status.\n\nTe Wānanga o Aotearoa experienced phenomenal growth during the early 2000s (growing from 3,127 students in 2000 to 66,756 students in 2004) and quickly become the largest tertiary education institution in the country; however, there was a price to pay for this rapid expansion. The organisation became mired under the weight of its own popularity; it was struggling to keep pace with the insatiable desire for learning amongst those who had previously been sidelined by an exclusive education system and its internal processes were struggling to cope.\n\nIn 2005, the government appointed a group of Crown managers to help consolidate the organisation and put in place systems and processes more befitting a nationwide institution of this magnitude. This work included a nationwide restructure, reorganisation of the executive level of the institution, and a review of the curriculum portfolio. Since this time, Te Wānanga o Aotearoa has re-established itself as a leading provider of indigenous education in Aotearoa New Zealand and its reputation has grown as a popular destination for overseas organisations hoping to emulate its success.\n\nIn traditional times, where wānanga were houses of higher learning dedicated to perpetuating mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge). Attendance at whare wānanga was a great privilege, with stringent selection processes ensuring that only the most capable students were chosen to receive the knowledge that was to be shared. In the modern context, wānanga retain their status as places of higher learning, sitting alongside universities and polytechnics as recognised tertiary institutions in Aotearoa New Zealand.\n\nTe Wānanga o Aotearoa is one of three wānanga that have been given statutory recognition in Aotearoa New Zealand. The three wānanga are represented by the collective national association \"Te Tauihu o Ngā Wānanga\".\n\nTe Wānanga o Aotearoa expresses āhuatanga Māori through the application of its guiding principles and through tikanga operating throughout the organisation in day-to-day activities. Āhuatanga Māori is also expressed through the actions of its staff members and through the programmes it delivers. Although operating within te ao Māori (the Māori sphere), Te Wānanga o Aotearoa is an inclusive organisation that welcomes all New Zealanders.\n\nTe Wānanga o Aotearoa delivers programmes from certificate through to degree level. Its programme portfolio has been developed over a number of years in consultation with iwi, industry, community and students. Te Wānanga o Aotearoa considers feedback from these groups in combination with the objectives of the Government's Tertiary Education Strategy, organisational objectives and constraints that impact on the organisation.\n\nA key objective is to eliminate, as much as possible, barriers that have previously prevented people from participating in tertiary education, including economic barriers, geographical barriers, barriers created by family and work commitments, and barriers created by previous negative experiences in the secondary and tertiary education systems. To eliminate these barriers, Te Wānanga o Aotearoa strives to keep fees to an absolute minimum, to maximise programme options and locations, to offer a range of flexible learning hours and to provide as much student support as possible. The resulting mix of programmes at each site represents a balance of these often competing objectives.\n\nIn 2010, more than 35,000 students studied at Te Wānanga o Aotearoa. Of these students, 18,020 (50.1%) indicated they had Māori whakapapa (ancestry) and 3,702 (10.3%) indicated Pasifika origins. Sixty-eight per cent of students were women and 52% were older than 40 years of age.\n\nThirty-eight per cent of students enrolling at Te Wānanga o Aotearoa in 2010 did not have any qualification and 30% were unemployed just prior to enrolling. Students continued to record high levels of student satisfaction during 2010. Most notably, 91% of students across the country were 'very satisfied' or 'satisfied' with their tutor and 90% of students were 'very satisfied' or 'satisfied' with their learning environment. Students also recorded high levels of satisfaction with the quality of learning resources, their programmes and the quality of facilities on their campus.\n\nIn 2010, Te Wānanga o Aotearoa achieved an overall programme graduation rate of 70%, and course completion and retention rates of 78% and 81% respectively.\n\nDuring the 25 years since its foundation, Te Wānanga o Aotearoa has been catering for an increasingly more mature student group as the organisation's reputation for delivering inclusive and engaging adult education has spread. While remaining committed to providing educational opportunities for its mature students, the organisation is now returning to its roots.\n\nAt a time when youth unemployment in Aotearoa New Zealand is becoming severe, Te Wānanga o Aotearoa is introducing a range of new youth initiatives that will help rangatahi (young people) make the transition from an increasingly irrelevant secondary education system into the world of tertiary education. Initiatives range from the provision of full-time youth learning facilities to offering day courses for those enrolled in mainstream secondary schools.\n\nOpen Wānanga (a wholly owned subsidiary of Te Wānanga o Aotearoa) provides home-based learning to students throughout Aotearoa New Zealand whose circumstances prevent them from attending on-site classes. The most popular subject areas for students studying through Open Wānanga were Māori history and knowledge and English language.\n\nOpen Wānanga was folded back up into Te Wānanga o Aotearoa in 2015.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1946946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946946", "title": "Lead generation", "text": "Lead generation\n\nIn marketing, lead generation () is the initiation of consumer interest or enquiry into products or services of a business. Leads can be created for purposes such as list building, e-newsletter list acquisition or for sales leads. The methods for generating leads typically fall under the umbrella of advertising, but may also include non-paid sources such as organic search engine results or referrals from existing customers.\n\nLeads may come from various sources or activities, for example, digitally via the Internet, through personal referrals, through telephone calls either by the company or telemarketers, through advertisements, and events. A 2015 study found that 89% of respondents cited email as the most-used channel for generating leads, followed by content marketing, search engine, and finally events. A study from 2014 found that direct traffic, search engines, and web referrals were the three most popular online channels for lead generation, accounting for 93% of leads.\n\nLead generation is often paired with lead management to move leads through the purchase funnel. This combination of activities is referred to as pipeline marketing.\n\nA lead is usually allotted to an individual to follow up on. Once the individual (e.g. salesperson) reviews and qualifies it to have potential business, the lead gets converted to an opportunity for a business. The opportunity then has to undergo multiple sales stages before the deal is won.\n\nA lead usually is the contact information and in some cases, demographic information of a customer who is interested in a specific product or service. There are two types of leads in the lead generation market: sales leads and marketing leads.\n\nSales leads are generated on the basis of demographic criteria such as FICO score (United States), income, age, household income, psychographic, etc. These leads are resold to multiple advertisers. Sales leads are typically followed up through phone calls by the sales force. Sales leads are commonly found in the mortgage, insurance and finance industries.\n\nMarketing leads are brand-specific leads generated for a unique advertiser offer. In direct contrast to sales leads, marketing leads are sold only once. Because transparency is a necessary requisite for generating marketing leads, marketing lead campaigns can be optimized by mapping leads to their sources.\n\nAn investor lead is a type of a sales lead. An investor lead is the identity of a person or entity potentially interested in participating in an investment, and represents the first stage of an investment sales process. Investor leads are considered to have some disposable income that they can use to participate in appropriate investment opportunities in exchange for return on investment in the form of interest, dividend, profit sharing or asset appreciation. Investor lead lists are normally generated through investment surveys, investor newsletter subscriptions or through companies raising capital and selling the database of people who expressed an interest in their opportunity. Investor Lead lists are commonly used by small businesses looking to fund their venture or simply needing expansion capital that was not readily available by banks and traditional lending sources.\n\nBusiness leads are often grouped into segments to the level of qualification present within an organization. \n\nMarketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) are leads that have typically come through Inbound channels, such as Web Search or content marketing, and have expressed interest in a company's product or service. These leads have yet to interact with sales teams.\n\nSales Qualified Leads (SQLs) are leads screened by salespeople, oftentimes Sales Development Representatives (SDRs), for appropriate qualifying criteria to be followed-up with. Qualifying criteria include need, budget, capacity, time-frame, interest, or authority to purchase.\n\nOnline lead generation is an Internet marketing term that refers to the generation of prospective consumer interest or inquiry into a business' products or services through the Internet. Leads, also known as contacts, can be generated for a variety of purposes: list building, e-newsletter list acquisition, building out reward programs, loyalty programs or for other member acquisition programs.\n\nWith the rise of social networking websites, social media is used by organizations and individuals to generate leads or gain business opportunities. Many companies actively participate on social networks including LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook to find talent pools or market their new products and services.\n\nEmail remains one of the main ways that businesses communicate with clients & vendors. Because of this, marketers often send messages to users’ inboxes. Many leads are generated every day with cold email campaigns and warm email campaigns. For the foreseeable future email campaigns remain a great email marketing tool.\n\nThere are three main pricing models in the online advertising market that marketers can use to buy advertising and generate leads:\n\n\nRecently, there has been a rapid increase in online lead generation: banner and direct response advertising that works off a CPL pricing model. In a pay-per-acquisition (PPA) pricing model, advertisers pay only for qualified leads resulting from\nthose actions, irrespective of the clicks or impressions that went into generating the lead. PPA advertising is playing an active role in online lead generation.\n\nPPA pricing models are more advertiser-friendly as they are less susceptible to fraud and bots. With pay per click, providers can commit fraud by manufacturing leads or blending one source of lead with another (example: search-driven leads with co-registration leads) to generate higher profits for themselves.\n\nA GP Bullhound research report stated that the online lead generation was growing at 71% YTY — more than twice as fast as the online advertising market. The rapid growth is primarily driven by the advertiser demand for ROI focused marketing, a trend that is expected to accelerate during a recession.\n\nCommon types of opt-in ad units include:\nA common advertising metric for lead generation is cost per lead. The formula is Cost / Leads, for example if you created 100 leads and it cost $1000, the cost per lead would be $10.\n\nMany private healthcare organizations use online lead generation as a way to contact their existing patients and to acquire new patients.\n\n\"The number of Cyberchondriacs has jumped to 175 million from 154 million last year, possibly as a result of the health care reform debate. Furthermore, frequency of usage has also increased. Fully 32% of all adults who online says they look for health information \"often,\" compared to 22% last year.\" said Harris Interactive in a study completed and reported in August 2010 with demographics based in the United States of America.\n\nLead nurturing is the process of continuously contacting the potential buyer to update information and to improve the knowledge of the customer throughout the buying process. \nAll lead information tends to change or become obsolete as time passes. To keep the information up to date, the Lead Manager needs to continuously contact the leads' contact to update the information, to deepen the information in a are often grouped into segments to the level of qualification present within an organization.\n\nLead nurturing Process is the set of actions that the marketing team makes in order to nurture the leads. They can be both manual or automatic.\n\n\n"}

It is his largest work, and generally considered one of his finest, and an early Renaissance masterpiece.\n\nIts theme, derived from the popular 13th century book on the lives of saints by Jacopo da Varagine, the \"Golden Legend\", is the triumph of the True Cross – the legend of the wood from the Garden of Eden becoming the Cross on which Jesus Christ was crucified. This work demonstrates Piero's advanced knowledge of perspective and colour, his geometric orderliness and skill in pictorial construction.\n\nDating of the frescoes is uncertain, but they are believed to date from after 1447, when the Bacci family, commissioners of the frescoes, are recorded as having paid an unknown painter. It would have been finished around 1466. Most of the choir was painted in the early- to mid-1450s. Although the design of the frescoes is evidently Piero's, he seems to have delegated parts of the painting to assistants, as was usual. The hand of Giovanni di Piamonte, in particular, can be recognised in some of the frescoes.\n\nAn exhaustive restoration began in 1991 and was completed in 2000.\n\nThe main episodes depicted are:\n\n\nPiero diverged from his source material in a few important respects, including the story of King Solomon's meeting with the Queen of Sheba in a chronologically inaccurate place and giving greater emphasis to the two battles in which Christianity triumphs over paganism.\n\nThe cycle ends with a depiction of the Annunciation, not strictly part of the Legend of the True Cross but probably included by Piero for its universal meaning.\n\n\n"}

It is now one of the world's largest tank museums. It began in 1977 under the leadership of Colonel Michel Aubry, who convinced both the French military hierarchy and the local political authorities. Started 35 years ago with only a few hundred tracked vehicles, it has become a world-class collection which attracts visitors interested in the history of multinational tank development as well as professional armor specialists. From the very beginning, Colonel Aubry had made it a key policy of the museum to restore to running condition as many historically or technically significant vehicles as was feasible.\n\nThe museum has the world's largest collection of armoured fighting vehicles and contains well over 880 vehicles, although the British Tank Museum has a larger number of tanks. Because of shortage of space, less than a quarter can be exhibited, despite the move to a much larger building in 1993. Over 200 of the vehicles are fully functional, including the only surviving German Tiger II tank still in full working order. It often performs in the spectacular armor demonstration for the public, called the \"Carrousel\", which takes place in the summer every year. Saumur was the traditional training center for cavalry for over a century but now holds the current Armoured Cavalry Branch Training School which is entirely dedicated to training armor specialists. The tank museum had its early origins in a study collection.

{"id": "1946998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946998", "title": "Jeeves in the Offing", "text": "Jeeves in the Offing\n\nJeeves in the Offing is a comic novel by P. G. Wodehouse, first published in the United States on 4 April 1960 by Simon & Schuster, Inc., New York, under the title How Right You Are, Jeeves, and in the United Kingdom on 12 August 1960 by Herbert Jenkins, London.\n\nThe eighth Jeeves novel, \"Jeeves in the Offing\" chronicles another visit by Bertie Wooster to his Aunt Dahlia at Brinkley Court, and includes recurring characters Sir Roderick Glossop and Bobbie Wickham. It is the only novel to feature Aubrey Upjohn, former headmaster of Malvern House Preparatory School, as a major character.\n\nAn old friend Bertie went to preparatory school with, Reginald \"Kipper\" Herring, is staying with Bertie for a week. Bertie eagerly accepts an invitation from his aunt, Aunt Dahlia, to her home, Brinkley Court, since Jeeves is about to go to Herne Bay on holiday. Aunt Dahlia's husband, Bertie's Uncle Tom, is trying to make a business deal with an American named Homer Cream. While the two of them are in Harrogate, Mr. Cream's wife Adela Cream, an author of mystery stories, and their son Wilbert Cream are staying at Brinkley Court. The mischievous Roberta \"Bobbie\" Wickham, and Aubrey Upjohn, who was once Bertie and Kipper's oppressive headmaster, will also be there, along with Phyllis Mills. She is Upjohn's stepdaughter and Aunt Dahlia's goddaughter. Upjohn hopes to stand for a local election after giving a speech at the Market Snodsbury grammar school, and Phyllis is typing his speech.\n\nBefore going to Brinkley Court, Bertie learns that Kipper, who works for a weekly paper and is vengeful towards Upjohn, wrote a scathing, anonymous review of Upjohn's recently published book. Jeeves tells Bertie that Willie Cream is a notorious troublemaking playboy known as \"Broadway Willie\". After Jeeves leaves, Bertie sees a jarring announcement in \"The Times\" stating that he is engaged to Bobbie.\n\nAt Brinkley Court, Bertie finds Wilbert Cream reading poetry to Phyllis. He then finds Bobbie, who assures him that the engagement announcement was merely to scare her mother, who dislikes Bertie, into approving the man Bobbie really wants to marry, Reginald Herring.\n\nWhile her regular butler Seppings is away on holiday, the psychiatrist Sir Roderick Glossop is working undercover for Aunt Dahlia as a butler named Swordfish. Upjohn is urging his daughter Phyllis to marry Wilbert. Aunt Dahlia does not approve of Willie's reputation, so at her behest, Glossop is there to observe Wilbert's behaviour. Bertie tries to keep Wilbert away from Phyllis. By letter, Jeeves informs Bertie that Willie Cream is a kleptomaniac. Uncle Tom's silver cow-creamer goes missing.\n\nWhile Bobbie is away, Kipper comes to Brinkley Court. He was engaged to Bobbie, but thinks it is over after seeing the marriage announcement for Bertie and Bobbie. He is relieved when Bertie tells him the announcement was fake. Glossop searches Wilbert Cream's room for the cow-creamer, and bonds with Bertie. Bobbie ends her engagement to Kipper after reading an angry letter he wrote when he first saw the marriage announcement, and proclaims she will marry Bertie. Bertie does not want to marry her, but is prevented by his personal code from turning down any woman, so he drives to Herne Bay to get help from Jeeves. Jeeves agrees to return to Brinkley with Bertie. Bobbie soon forgives Kipper's letter, but Kipper, to spite Bobbie, becomes engaged to Phyllis.\n\nAunt Dahlia tells Bertie that Wilbert Cream did not steal the cow-creamer. Uncle Tom sold it to him. Meanwhile, Upjohn intends to sue Kipper's paper for libel. While his review was mostly legitimate, a small libellous portion was secretly added by Bobbie. Apologetic, Bobbie reconciles with Kipper. Glossop suggests that Kipper save his job by rescuing Upjohn from drowning. After Bertie and Bobbie fail to push Upjohn in the nearby lake, Bertie and Phyllis's dog Poppet fall in instead. Kipper dives in to help Bertie, mistaking him for Upjohn, and Wilbert dives in to help Phyllis's dog Poppet. Moved, Phyllis gets engaged to Wilbert. This initially upsets Aunt Dahlia, though it turns out that Wilbert is not actually the infamous Broadway Willie: that is his younger brother, Wilfred.\n\nUpjohn becomes aware that Kipper wrote the scathing review and refuses to stay in the same house. Jeeves packs for Upjohn, neglecting to pack Upjohn's typed speech. After receiving the typescript from Jeeves, Bobbie makes Upjohn withdraw his libel suit before she returns it to him.\n\nThinking Wilbert stole it, Glossop confiscated the cow-creamer. Adela Cream finds the cow-creamer in Glossop's room and thinks he stole it. To prevent a misunderstanding, Glossop has revealed his true occupation. Following Jeeves's advice, Glossop has claimed he had been brought to observe Bertie and had recovered the cow-creamer from Bertie's room. Bertie is upset that the Cream family thinks he is a kleptomaniac, but Jeeves placates Bertie by saying that he has the satisfaction of helping his uncle. Bertie, remembering receiving gifts from Uncle Tom while at prep school, replies, \"How right you are, Jeeves!\".\n\nWodehouse juxtaposes slang with formal language for comic effect. One of the ways this occurs is when Bertie tries to recall a quotation or Jeeves recites it, and Bertie then rephrases that quotation with more colloquial language. For example, Bertie and Jeeves allude to Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" and \"Hamlet\" in chapter 11:\n\n\"[Poppet's] belligerent attitude is simple—\"\"Sound and fury signifying nothing, sir?\"\"That's it, pure swank. A few civil words and he will be grappling you…what's the expression I've heard you use?\"\"Grappling me to his soul with hoops of steel, sir?\"\"In the first two minutes.\"\n\nIn addition to picking up literary allusions from Jeeves, Bertie learns many words and phrases from him, especially Latin terminology. While illustrating the influence that Jeeves has over Bertie, this also leads to Bertie rephrasing Jeeves's formal language in comical ways. For example, a ludicrous effect is created when Bertie combines the Latin phrase \"nolle prosequi\", which he learned from Jeeves, with a Biblical reference when explaining to Bobbie that it was Balaam's ass that was noted for stubbornness, not Jonah's, in chapter 19:\n\n\"Jeeves.\"\"Sir?\"\"To settle a bet, wasn't it Balaam's ass that entered the \"nolle prosequi\"?\"\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nWhen Bertie uses a word or phrase he learned from Jeeves, it is typically one that Jeeves used earlier in the same story or in a previous story. However, on a few occasions, Bertie mentions picking up a word or phrase from Jeeves that Jeeves was never depicted using earlier in the series. This occurs in chapter 1, when Bertie employs the word \"altruistic\": \"You are probably not familiar with the word, but it's one I've heard Jeeves use. It's what you say of a fellow who gives selfless service, not counting the cost\".\n\nWodehouse occasionally has Bertie using transferred epithets, usually modifying the grammatical object of the sentence with an adjective instead of using the corresponding adverb to modify the verb of the sentence. (For example, \"He was now smoking a sad cigarette and waiting for the blow to fall\"). In at least one instance, Wodehouse uses a transferred epithet by modifying the grammatical subject of the sentence with an adjective to describe the emotion of the person concerned. This occurs in chapter 2: \"It was plain that I had shaken him. His eyes widened, and an astonished piece of toast fell from his grasp\".\n\nThe expression \"in the offing\", used in the novel's title for the UK edition, describes something that is likely to happen or arrive soon.\n\nThe earliest extant notes for the novel, written by Wodehouse in November 1956, show that he initially planned for the plot to have Aunt Dahlia and Uncle Tom away in America, while Aunt Agatha and Lord Worplesdon were staying at Brinkley Court. This preliminary plot involves an American millionaire and the theft of the silver cow-creamer, similar to the final story, as well as Bertie reading in the paper of his engagement to someone, though it is to a girl whom he has never met. The notes indicate that Wodehouse determined some of the basic parts of the plot before deciding on the specific characters as placeholders are in place of character names, as in the following note: \"X wants to marry Y, gets B. to say he is engd. to Y. Formidable mother.\"\n\nAfter dropping the project in December 1956, Wodehouse resumed working on it in early 1958. In August 1958, he composed a list of characters, which includes several characters not present in the final version of the book. These characters include Uncle Tom's sister, Judson Coker (a character from Wodehouse's 1924 novel \"Bill the Conqueror\"), and Edwin the Boy Scout (the troublesome young brother of Florence Craye), who would have acted as a detective.\n\nA surviving late draft for the novel shows some small changes made by Wodehouse to make Bertie's language more comical and elaborate. For example, in the sentence, \"His blood pressure was high [, his eye rolled in what they call a fine frenzy,] and he was death-where-is-thy-sting-ing like nobody's business\", the clause in brackets was inserted.\n\nLike in \"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit\", there is a reference in the book to David Niven, the actor who portrayed Bertie Wooster in the earlier 1936 film \"Thank You, Jeeves!\". In the novel, Bertie describes the suspected playboy Wilbert Cream as resembling David Niven.\n\nThis story appeared in three magazines under the title \"How Right You Are, Jeeves\". First, the story was serialized from 29 August to 19 September 1959 in the British magazine \"John Bull\" magazine, illustrated by Richard O. Rose, then published in February 1960 in the American magazine \"Playboy\", illustrated by Bill Charmatz, and lastly published on 23 April 1960 in the Canadian magazine \"Star Weekly\", illustrated by Gerry Sevier.\n\nAs \"How Right You Are, Jeeves\", the story was featured in the 1976 collection \"Jeeves, Jeeves, Jeeves\", which also included two other novels, \"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves\" and \"Jeeves and the Tie That Binds\".\n\n\nThis story was not adapted for any \"Jeeves and Wooster\" episode.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She has stated that the song is about the difference between how things appear to be and how they really are.\n\nNanci Griffith recorded it first in her 1987 album \"Lone Star State of Mind\". Nanci Griffith stated that in 1986, a songwriter Julie Gold had sent her the song asking Griffith what was wrong with it, as Gold had sent it to so many artists and record companies but none wanted to record it. Griffith had answered that she loved it so much the moment she heard it and that she really wanted to hear it performed personally by Gold herself. Thus was established a good relationship between the two with Griffith being the first to record \"From a Distance\" in her \"Lone Star State of Mind\" album. Although the Griffith version became very popular, the song failed to chart until Bette Midler covered it.\n\nGriffith performed it live many times from that day on and a version of her live performance done on August 19 and 20, 1988 at the Anderson Fair, a Houston, Texas club and long known for featuring folk artists in an intimate setting, appeared in her live album \"One Fair Summer Evening\".\n\nThe song became a sleeper hit in Ireland, spending 17 non-consecutive weeks in the Irish Top 30 during 1988, peaking at number nine in April.\n\nIreland 7\" (MCA 1169)\n\nThe song became an international commercial success after it was recorded in 1990 by Bette Midler for the album \"Some People's Lives\". \"From a Distance\" reached number one on the Adult Contemporary chart and peaked at number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 behind Stevie B's \"Because I Love You (The Postman Song)\" The song went on to win a Grammy for Song of the Year in 1991. The song also won a \"3 Million Airs Award\" from Broadcast Music Incorporated.\n\nMidler re-recorded a Christmas edition for her 2006 Christmas album, \"Cool Yule\", with additional lyrics by Los Angeles native Jay Landers. Additional recordings of the original have been performed by Gold, Griffith, Simon Nicol (of Fairport Convention) and many others.\n\nLarry Flick from \"Billboard\" described the song as a \"soothing hymn that invokes inspirational images similar to \"Wind Beneath My Wings\", proves that the Divine Miss M still has what it takes to tackle top 40 territory.\" Dave Sholin from the \"Gavin Report\" wrote that Midler's Grammy for \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" \"reaffirmed her innate ability to extract every single ounce of emotion out of a song. Teaming once again with producer Arif Mardin, she seems right at home with a tune that has much of the same quality as her giant hit of last year. Bette's certain to go the distance again.\" Gene Sandbloom from \"The Network Forty\" said that \"the lyrics manage to take in the globe (with a minimum of sugar) and deliver a song worth listening to a hundred times. The music, produced by sound specialist Arif Mardin, is a slow crescendo made to support Midler's voice without overwhelming.\" He added that she \"again uses her \"no frills\" vocal approach which makes this song so genuine.\" Conversely, Midler's recording of the song ranked at number 37 on VH1's list of the \"50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs Ever.\" and ranked at number 14 on \"Blender Magazine's\" list of \"The 50 Worst Songs Ever\". Criticisms focus on the song's lyrical content and the production of Midler's version.\n\nUK 7\" (Atlantic A7820)\nUS cassette (Atlantic 7567-84888-4)\nJapan 3\" (Atlantic AMDY-5032)\n\nUS CD maxi promo (Atlantic PRCD3528)\n\nUK CD maxi (Atlantic A7820CD)\nUK 12\" (Atlantic A7820T)\n\nUS CD maxi (Columbia 88697-00957-2)\n\nNote: Christmas version from 2006\n\nThe song was simultaneously released by Cliff Richard in October 1990 from a similarly titled album \"\" reaching number 11 in the UK Singles Charts and number 16 in Ireland.\n\nIn 1999, on his \"40th Anniversary Tour\" as a recording artist, Richard opened his concert in Royal Albert Hall with the song.\n\nUK 7\"/UK Picture Disc (EMI EM 155/EMI EMPD 155)\n\nUK CD single/UK 12\" (EMI CDEM 155/EMI 12EM 155)\n\nIn 2020 a parody of the song called \"Keep Your Distance\" was written, reminding listeners to practice social distancing.\n\n\"From a Distance\" became a 2011 charity single in support of Magdalene Survivors Together, a charity set in July 2009 by Gerard Boland focusing on the human rights aspect of the Magdalene Laundries in Ireland. \nThe 2011 single had vocal participation from a great number of artists: Sinéad O'Connor, Tommy Fleming, Brian Kennedy, Daniel O'Donnell, Ann Scott, Moya Brennan, Charlie Landsborough, Patrick Sheehy, Lumiere and the Scottish Glasgow Gospel Choir. The track was produced by John Reynolds and Tim Oliver and mastered at Soundmastwers, London. Tesco Ireland, Beaumex Ireland and Believe Digital distributed the single online and it was made available in Tesco stores through Ireland. The proceeds would go to build an Irish national monument for the Magdalene women.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1947027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1947027", "title": "Jim Davidson", "text": "Jim Davidson\n\nJames Cameron Davidson (born 13 December 1953) is an English stand-up comedian who hosted the television shows \"Big Break\" and \"The Generation Game\". He also develops adult pantomime shows such as \"Boobs in the Wood\" and \"Sinderella\".\n\nDavidson has attracted controversy for his frequent jokes about women, ethnic minorities, homosexuals and disabled people, although he denies accusations that he is prejudiced against these groups.\n\nThe son of a Scottish father from Glasgow and Irish mother from Cork, Davidson was born in Kidbrooke, London, and attended Kidbrooke Park Primary School, Blackheath, and St Austin's School in Charlton. Having impressed some acquaintances of his father with impressions of celebrities, he was chosen to appear in Ralph Reader's Gang Show at the Golders Green Hippodrome aged 12 and appeared on television in the \"Billy Cotton Band Show.\" He also briefly attended a stage school in Woolwich.\n\nUpon leaving school he was a drummer for pub bands and worked as a supermarket shelf stacker, a messenger, air ticket clerk for a travel agency, a cashier for Wall's ice cream, for Rank Xerox (having trained as a reprographics operator) and as a window cleaner.\n\nDavidson found his way into show business when as a regular in a pub in Woolwich, he undertook an act after the regular comedian had not turned up. He then became a regular on the London comedy circuit, and first auditioned for \"Opportunity Knocks\" in 1975, unsuccessfully; he was told by Hughie Green to \"go away\". His audition for \"New Faces\" was more successful, and he proceeded to win the show by one point, and then to come second in the overall contest.\n\nHis success was quickly followed by many more appearances on television, including \"What's On Next\" and several series of his own show \"The Jim Davidson Show\" (1979–1982) which ran for five complete series and won Davidson the \"TV Times\" award as \"Funniest Man On Television\".\n\nDavidson appeared on an edition of the BBC1 series \"Seaside Special\", shown on 20 August 1977, hosted by Tony Blackburn and David Hamilton. \"The Stage\"'s reviewer, Martyn Wade, was not impressed: \"comedian Jim Davidson had already won first prize for lack of taste with crude racist jokes tracing the adventures of a black man whose nickname was Chalky and whose other names included Toilet-Roll. \"Day-light come and I gotta sign on\" is a representative line from Mr Davidson's act.\" \n\nHe starred in TV sitcoms \"Up the Elephant and Round the Castle\" (1983–1985) and \"Home James!\" (1987–1990). His one man show for Thames Television, \"Stand Up Jim Davidson\" (1990), was recorded at London's Royalty Theatre.\n\nDavidson became known for \"Big Break\" (1991–2002) and as the third host of \"The Generation Game\" (1995–2002), as the successor to Bruce Forsyth and Larry Grayson. In September 2007, Davidson appeared in the third series of \"Hell's Kitchen\" (2007) in the UK, and in May 2008 he appeared in the BBC's \"Comedy Map of Britain\".\n\nOn 2 January 2013, Davidson was set to become a housemate in the eleventh series of \"Celebrity Big Brother\", but was arrested at Heathrow Airport by police officers working on Operation Yewtree. On 3 January 2014, a year after being arrested and without being charged, he became a housemate in the show's thirteenth series. On 29 January 2014, he left the Big Brother house as the winner.\n\nDavidson's touring is developed from his original London comedy circuit show, for pub and club audiences. Aimed at a very different audience from that of his television work, it contains a lot more strong language, which he promotes as adult entertainment. This has also developed into his adult pantomime work, including productions with titles such as: \"Boobs in the Wood\" and \"SINderella\".\n\nIn 2006, for the first time in 14 years, he refused to play Great Yarmouth, stating that the resort was \"full of overweight people in flip-flops and fat children of all colours and no class\". The inhabitants of the town took this as a personal affront, although said he was referring to tourists.\n\nDavidson has appeared in the UK chart under his own name with the double A-sided \"White Christmas\"/\"Too Risky\". It peaked at No. 52 in December 1980.\n\nDavidson has several business interests. He set up a company which bought or leased several seaside theatres or piers, including the Winter Gardens building in Great Yarmouth, which was converted into a nightclub. He lost £700,000 on a pantomime production of \"Dick Whittington\" and after a meeting with the Inland Revenue in 2003, he sold the company.\n\nDavidson has entertained British armed forces. He is currently chairman of the British Forces Foundation charity, which aims to promote the well-being and esprit de corps of service personnel. Davidson was awarded the OBE in the New Year's Honours List 2001 for his services to charity.\n\nDavidson is a Freemason and a long-standing member of the Westminster City Council Lodge No 2882. He was formerly also a member of the Chelsea Lodge No 3098 (whose members are all entertainers) but has resigned; he was the founding Worshipful Master of British Forces Foundation Lodge No 9725 on its formation in 2000.\n\nOn 27 August 2003, after a meeting with the Inland Revenue, Davidson claimed he spent £10,000 a week on back taxes, commission to agents, maintenance and school fees, and a £2.2 million mortgage: \"My problem is money – I used to earn five times as much as I do now, but I still pay the same maintenance, school fees and commission to agents,\" he told \"Radio Times\" magazine.\n\nOn 6 July 2006, having failed to keep up payments on a £1.4 million back tax bill that he had reduced to £700,000, Davidson was declared bankrupt.\n\nThroughout his career, Davidson has made jokes about women, ethnic minorities, homosexuals and disabled people in his stand-up act, which has made him a subject of frequent criticism. The \"Shropshire Star\" however wrote that tabloid reports of his divorce payouts, court orders for cancelled shows and uncompromising tax bills made him out to be a \"loveable rogue\".\n\nLaurence Clark, himself a wheelchair user, in response performed a show called 'The Jim Davidson Guide to Equality' at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2004. Clark refused to perform the show if Jim Davidson was in his audience.\nJournalist Martin Fletcher describes Davidson as \"extraordinarily foul-mouthed, racist, and sexist\" and a \"throwback\"; whilst quoting television critic Garry Bushell calling Davidson a \"family entertainer\".\n\nDavidson has responded to accusations of prejudice by saying: \"It is a difficult thing, comedy, and I'm on a loser. If I cured Aids and fed Africa and ended Ebola and found that missing aeroplane I'd still be that horrible racist, sexist, homophobic comedian. By people, with respect, who haven't seen me. Or are judging me from the past.\"\n\nIn October 2006, he was again accused of making insensitive jokes about cancer sufferers, blind people, a woman in a wheelchair, and the recent trial over the murder of Damilola Taylor, prompting a woman to walk out of the show in disgust. Davidson vehemently denied the charge, claiming that jokes about blind people and cancer sufferers would have merited a \"mass walkout\". He also said the comments about the Damilola Taylor trial were taken out of context: \"My actual remark was that I thought the killers should be locked away forever. And if she objects to that then that is her prerogative.\" Davidson was also quoted as saying \"If what I was saying was true I would have got up and left myself\".\n\nIn September 2007, Davidson participated on the celebrity reality TV programme \"Hell's Kitchen\". During his time on the show, Davidson attracted negative media attention over what was identified as homophobic bullying towards TV presenter and openly gay contestant Brian Dowling. Davidson asked Dowling, \"Are you on our side?\" when referring to whether or not he would be participating for the boys' or girls' team. Davidson used the word \"shirt-lifters\" in front of him, and was constantly asking if Dowling would like to try on one of \"John Virgo's lovely waistcoats\", which Davidson owns. Davidson later described himself as a \"homophobic arsehole\". The programme was broadcast on ITV on 4 September 2007. On 10 September, Davidson was asked to leave \"Hell's Kitchen\" following further problems with Dowling. After Davidson's exit from the programme, the BBC reported that the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom had received 46 complaints alleging that Davidson had bullied Dowling. Ofcom concluded that nothing unacceptable had happened. ITV, the channel which had originally broadcast the programme, issued a statement, regretting Davidson's \"unacceptable remarks\".\n\nDavidson again courted controversy in December 2007, when he made a joke about rape victims during a show at the Newark Palace Theatre, in Nottinghamshire. A local paper, the \"Nottingham Evening Post\", stated that: \"there were moments when he did stray too far over the line (most notably with a routine on rape).\"\n\nIn 2002, Davidson was escorted from the grounds of the Marriott Bristol Royal Hotel, after it was alleged that he had become confrontational and abusive to staff.\n\nIn October 2003, Davidson refused to go on stage in Plymouth because he objected to wheelchair users in the front row. A spokesman for the Plymouth Pavilions, where he was performing as part of a national tour, said: \"Jim Davidson apparently took exception to a number of wheelchair users in the front stalls of the Pavilions Arena. Mr Davidson cited the fact that a proportion of his act was aimed at disabled customers and that he would be unable to perform under these circumstances.\" In a statement Davidson explained he \"took the mick\" out of everyone in the front row of his shows. \"As all the people in the front row were in wheelchairs I feared it would appear I was specifically targeting disabled people. I asked if just some would mind moving. Much of my act depends upon audience reaction and in fact one part of the show involves getting the audience to gang up against the front row.\"\n\nIn 2004, comedian Jimmy Carr threatened legal action against Davidson, accusing him of having plagiarised some of his comic material. Davidson responded by saying the claims were 'ridiculous', and no further action was taken.\n\nDavidson was called on as a character witness to drug trafficker Brian Brendan Wright in 2007. Despite Davidson's testifying to Wright's character, the judge concluded that Wright was \"a master criminal, manipulative, influential and powerful,\" and sentenced him to 30 years in prison.\n\nOn 2 January 2013, as Davidson was set to become a housemate in the eleventh series of \"Celebrity Big Brother\", he was arrested at Heathrow Airport by police officers working on Operation Yewtree. On 20 March, he was arrested again over new allegations of sexual offences. On 21 August, however, it was announced that no further action would be taken in relation to the allegations of historic sex abuse, due to insufficient evidence.\n\nOn 21 November 2018, Davidson was caught up in London traffic resulting from Extinction Rebellion protests which blocked a number of London bridges to raise awareness of the lack of action from governments over climate change. Davidson was photographed by the BBC, allegedly shouted at police and was filmed near the front of a blockade driving a large SUV, where he inexplicably remarked that Jeremy Corbyn (who was not involved) was an \"environmental disaster\". Davidson later told Nigel Farage on LBC radio that the reason for his anger had been that the demonstrations had almost prevented him \"from getting his pie and mash\".\n\nDavidson has written two autobiographies; \"The Full Monty\" (1993) and \"Close to the Edge\" (2001).\n\nDavidson's numerous marriages spurred John Mills to send a Telemessage on the occasion of his fourth, which read simply: \"Will It Last?\" The marriage ended ten years later. Davidson subsequently returned the compliment to Mills and his wife on their sixtieth wedding anniversary, with a Telemessage bearing the same wording.\n\nIn March 2004, Davidson, a Conservative supporter, publicly left the United Kingdom for the tax-free haven of Dubai, UAE in protest at the Labour government, although it was also noted by HMRC at the time that his move coincided with an unpaid tax bill of approximately £700,000. At the time, he declared that \"I may as well go to Dubai and be an ethnic minority there than wait five years till I become one here.\" He moved back to the UK after living in Dubai for five years. He has also expressed sympathy for UKIP leader Nigel Farage, describing the party as \"the Jim Davidson of the political world\". He once again moved to Dubai after being accused of sexual offences.\n\nDavidson is a supporter of Charlton Athletic, the local club in the area where he grew up. In the 1980s, he was a Director at AFC Bournemouth.\n\nOn 18 June 2014, Davidson attended the assault trial of former N-Dubz frontman Dappy. \"Dappy is a good friend of mine. I don't know what's happened in this case but I'm just here to show him my support,\" Davidson said. Dappy's legal team declined Davidson's offer to serve as a character witness for the singer.\n\nDavidson has been married five times. His first four marriages ended in divorce, and he has five children by three wives:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2011, Davidson toured with a play, \"Stand Up...And Be Counted\". The play was about the failing career of a washed-up racist comic. This caused controversy and links made in the media with similarities between the main character and Davidson's own career. On 18 March 2011, Davidson announced the show was being cancelled because of poor ticket sales. It had visited only four of the 12 planned city destinations. Davidson added that he was still in talks to bring the show to the West End at a later date.\n\nDavidson has also produced and starred in a number of so-called \"Adult pantomimes\" being blue humoured (and often controversial)versions of the conventional Panto, in the UK the DVD and video versions are certificate 18.\n\n\"Sinderella\" 1995 (also sold on Video)\n\"Boobs in the Wood\" 1999 (also on video/DVD)\n\"Sinderella Comes Again\" 2004 (DVD)\n\"Sinderella 2: Scottish Romp\" 2015, production cut short due to poor sales\n\n\n"}

As the name suggests, it has been the dwelling (\"vihar\") of peacocks (\"mayur\"). Even today, the area has a closed sanctuary dedicated to the conservation of peacocks. \n\nThis residential area came into existence in 1979-80, back when the trans-Yamuna area, part of today's East Delhi was sparsely populated. The government decided to sell the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) flats to employees of Public Sector Units (PSU's) and semi-PSU's like the BHEL, among others. This was also an experiment to integrate people belonging to various economic bracket's i.e. High Income Group (HIG's), Middle Income Group (MIG's) and Low Income Group (LIG's) in one community. The residential units in Mayur Vihar are a relatively recent phenomenon and were developed in three phases. It is well connected by high-frequency buses and is serviced by the Blue Line and Pink Line (Delhi Metro).\n\nIt is broadly situated between Pandav Nagar and Old Patparganj to the north, Mayur Vihar Phase 1 extension to the south and Trilokpuri to the east, with the Yamuna flanking it on the west. The area is accessible by the Mayur Vihar-I and Mayur Vihar Pocket-1 metro stations.\n\nPhase I has DDA flats (organized into Pockets I-V) and Housing Co-Operative Society Buildings (e.g., Hindustan Apartments, Upkar Apartments, Ashiyana Apartments, Sadar Apartments, Glaxo Apartments). The first immigrants to Phase I were mainly in Pocket III and Pocket I in the early 1980s. Later, Pocket II, Pocket IV (near metro station) and Pocket V were developed. The nearest village is known as Chilla Gaon that is now surrounded by housing societies. Samachar Apartments is one of the oldest apartments in the locality. People bought land and moved in prior to 1985 at very low costs. Now, the area is considered to be an expensive real estate market with the availability of two metro lines apart from the proximity to both the central business districts of Connaught Place, New Delhi - Barakhamba Road to the east and Sector 15-18 of Noida to the south.\n\nPocket V of the Mayur Vihar was latest colony allotted and developed by the DDA. It is on the Main Mother Dairy Road just opp to Sanjay Lake. Societies were developed near the Main Noida link road and the area is named as Mayur Vihar Extension with a separate Metro station of the same name.\n\n\nA prominent Hindu temple is Shri Subha Siddhi Vinayaka Mandir Society, registered in June, 1990 in Pocket - IV, Mayur Vihar, Phase-1, Delhi - 110091. In 1996, action was taken to construct a proper permanent Sannadhi for housing Lord Vinayaka, as the Principal Deity. Thus the primary structure came into being, having First Floor and Vimanam (Panch-Dala) erected thereon. Kumbabishekam was performed in February 1997. In 1991, 2 more Sannadhis, one for Navagrahas and the other for Lord Hanuman were added. In 1997, in keeping with the general sentiments of the devotees, one more Sannadhi for Shiv Parivar was added to commence regular Pradosh-Kala Pujas for Lord Shiva. In the same year, the temple was sanctified with the venerable presence of Great Spiritual Gurus (3 Sankaracharyas) simultaneously who performed Abhishekam for the deity, by their own hands. In 2005, another important decision was taken to construct an exclusive Sannadhi for Lord Subrahmanya (Murugar) for which construction was commenced.\n\nThe Uttara Guruvayurappan Temple is a prominent place of worship for Malayali community.\n\nThe Mayur Vihar Kali Bari is the venue where the Bengali Hindu community celebrates all of their major religious festivities including Durga Puja, famous in East Delhi.

{"id": "1947039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1947039", "title": "States and Social Revolutions", "text": "States and Social Revolutions\n\nStates and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia and China is a 1979 book by political scientist and sociologist Theda Skocpol, published by Cambridge University Press, which explains the causes of revolutions through the structural functionalism sociological paradigm comparative historical analysis of the French Revolution of 1789 through the early 19th century, the Russian Revolution of 1917 through the 1930s and the Chinese Revolution of 1911 through the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s. Skocpol argues that these three cases, despite being spread over a century and a half, are similar in the sense that all three were social revolutions.\n\nSkocpol asserts that social revolutions are rapid and basic transformations of a society's state and class structures. She distinguishes this from mere rebellions, which involve a revolt of subordinate classes but may not create structural change, and from political revolutions that may change state structures but not social structures. What is unique about social revolutions, she argues, is that basic changes in social structure and political structure occur in a mutually reinforcing fashion and these changes occur through intense sociopolitical conflict.\n\nThe book was highly influential in the study of revolutions, and has been credited with ushering in a new paradigm.\n\nThe book uses both J.S. Mill's methods of agreement and difference in the case selection. The book is not intended to be generalizable: it only applies to the specific cases that are studied in the book. The book employs process-tracing. While the primary focus is on France, Russia and China, she also examines \"moments of revolutionary crisis\" in 17th century England, 19th century Prussia and 19th century Japan. Those additional cases prevent Skocpol from \"selecting on the dependent variable\" – looking only at cases where revolutions occurred as a way to understand the causes of revolution – which would have been a methodological flaw. The additional cases serve as \"controls.\"\n\nBefore social revolutions can occur, she says, the administrative and military power of a state has to break down. Thus pre-revolutionary France, Russia and China had well-established states that stood astride large agrarian economies in which the imperial state and the landed upper classes partnered in the control and exploitation of the peasantry but monarchy in each country faced an extraordinary dilemma in dealing with foreign power intrusion on the one hand and resistance to raising resources by politically powerful dominant domestic classes on the other. A revolution such as the French revolution also presented itself with a significant factor of power conducted with social, political, and economical conflicts. She describes the processes by which the centralized administrative and military machinery disintegrated in these countries, which made class relations vulnerable to assaults from below.\n\nChapter one of \"States and Social Revolutions\", entitled \"Explaining Social Revolutions: Alternatives to Existing Theories\", starts by explaining not just the rarity of social revolutions, but also their momentous occurrences in the history of the world. These revolutions change the lives of every citizen of the country; they completely alter the organization of the state, including their class structures, as well as the prominent beliefs and theories held by the people. The rise of the new regimes in these countries completely exceeds the previous, prerevolutionary establishments. In France, the revolution allowed for the country to become an omnipresent, conquering force in Europe, the Russian Revolution created an unstoppable military and industrial superpower, and the Chinese Revolution was finally able to unify and transform a previously broken China. Such revolutions not only alter the state of the nation in question, but also impact the world as a whole, for a number of these countries (especially France, Russia, and China) have gone on to become Great Powers. Once they gained such a status, these countries were seen as examples of what needs to and should happen in nations even hundreds of thousands of miles away. Revolutionized countries gave others the hope that perhaps one day, if they fought for it, they could also possess a strong military, a solid economy, and rights that every human being deserves. It is without a doubt that other factors can lead to social and political change, however, social revolutions deserve special attention for their specific pattern of sociopolitical change.\n\nSocial revolutions are unique from all other transformations because they alone have the ability to change both social and political organization rapidly. Two occurrences are key in order for such revolutions to occur, first there must be class-based upheavals that cause societal-structural change, and secondly there must be a coincidence of political with social change. These two changes, social and political structure, occur simultaneously and go hand-in-hand due to sociopolitical conflicts. Therefore, the definition of social revolutions makes it clear that it is crucial to not leave out any of their complexities (for example, developments both at home and abroad should be considered), and secondly, that an actual change in nation and class structure must take place. \nA Structural Perspective: Chapter one then brings to light the four social-scientific theories of revolutions. First and foremost there is the Marxist family, which seems to be the most steadfast in attempting to understand the science of social revolutions. The key to Marx's approach to revolutions is interpreting them as a class-based movement that stems from structural contradictions occurring in conflict-ridden communities. Marxists further emphasize the mode of production and class structure (pertaining to land ownership and surplus). According to Marx, the primary source of revolutionary contradiction is the appearance of disconnect between the method of production between social forces and social relations of production. This disjuncture causes an immense disconnect between classes, increasing class conflicts. Revolutions occur due to the class action that is led by a rising revolutionary class, who tend to gain the support of others. Revolutions, over all, are seen as developing from class-divided methods of production, and altering one mode of production into an entirely new one through class conflict.\n\nNext is the Aggregate-Psychological Theory, by Ted Gurr. Which explains revolutions by psychological motivation for taking part in political violence. The key concept in this theory is how people act and how the minds of those opposing the government work. The essential arguments of Gurr's theory in understanding why revolution happen include understanding relative deprivation, interpreting people's justification and beliefs about political action, and analyzing the disconnected between the crowds capacity to act and the method in which they organize themselves.\n\nIn 1966, Chalmers Johnson came up with the Systems Value Consensus Theory, which explains revolutions as a violent reaction to ideological movements. In order for a successful revolution to occur, Johnson claims that there must be both change and violence; there is no such thing as a non-violent revolution. The Systems Value Consensus Theory departs from others in that it claims revolution is a form of social change, it does not equate social change.\n\nLastly, there is the Political-Conflict Theory, created by Charles Tilly, which states that a conflict between a government and an organized group occurs when the two contend for power. However, the groups cannot engage in political action unless they're part of an organized, connected group that is led by a leader. The Political-Conflict Theory posits that a revolution aims to produce a common goal, so that many people become eager to join the fight.\n\nInternational and World-Historical Contexts: Skocpol also discuss the role of the international community in social revolutions. It is assumed that each nation learns from the example of others, for example, modernization takes off from Western Europe, since that is where commercial-industrial and national revolutions originated. After being modernized, nations often fall into revolutions due to the change in values, the unity and mobilization of people, and temper, and once the revolution is successful the state can undergo more socioeconomic development. Another chain of events Skocpol describes is that hasty and disorderly economic expansion encourages and disturbs mass expectations, leading to unanimous dissatisfaction and political violence, that in turn destroys the current government. This, in turn, leads to new ideological movements that diminish the authority of existing structures and recreate societal values. Overall, a state's relationship with other countries and the international community in general helps to determine the outcome of its revolution. Not only do nations look to each other as examples of how to properly execute a revolution, but they also lean on others for support during one.\nThe Potential Autonomy of the State: It is common knowledge that social revolutions begin with visibly political crises. It is also clear that they continue because of the struggles of political parties and factions and they eventually lead to a culmination in the fortification of new state organizations that ensure socioeconomic transformations. In other words, Skocpol explains, the uprising of certain social classes and socioeconomic transformations are tied tightly to the fall of the old regime and with the strengthening and functioning of the new regime. Of utmost importance when attempting to understand social-revolutionary transformations is understanding the state as a macro-structure. The state is “a set of administrative, policing, and military organizations headed, and more or less well coordinated by, an executive authority. Any state first and fundamentally extracts resources from society and deploys these to create and support coercive and administrative organizations”. Within these systems there are institutions that convey social interests in state policymaking. In essence, the “administrative and coercive organizations are the basis of state power”, and the degree to which these state organizations are independent from control of the dominant-class depend on the case. There is often a struggle, or a clash of interests between the dominant-class and the state. For this reason, it is important for analysts to take into account not only the relationship between classes, but also between states and between states and both dominant and subordinate classes (according to Marxists). It is important to look at state relations internationally, and class-structured economies and political interests when trying to understand state organizations.\n\nA Comparative Historical Method: Attempts to study social revolutions have been avoided because most feel as though there are not enough cases to conclude from. The Marxist theory has been used the most due to its historically grounded categories. These theorists have found class struggles and changes in class relations that arise during revolutions, but have been unable to conclude whether these factors vary between revolutions and other transformations. However, even this seemingly better method of analysis “missed identifying the distinctive political-institutional changes that set revolutions apart from nonrevolutionary patterns of national development”. The comparative historical method aids in developing an explanation for revolutions that shows both general patterns of causes and outcomes as well as aspects that are particular to each case. Within this method, two or more historical trajectories (nation-states, institutional complexes, or civilizations) are compared side by side. Even further, there is a comparative historical analysis, which develops, tests, and refines hypotheses about occurrences crucial to nation-states. This method is made specifically to explain phenomena of which there are only a few existing cases. Problems with this method include trouble finding the historical case needed for a comparison; the method assumes the two events being compared and independent from one another, but that is not the case with revolutions; and lastly, it can only be applied in addition to another theory.\n\nWhy France, Russia, and China?: While there are certainly other successful revolutions, France, Russia, and China are three perfect examples, and were chosen for a few reasons. First, in each of these countries the state and class structures were not newly created or altered by colonialism. Secondly, each revolution occurred after an extended period of class and political struggle, culminated in the strength of revolutionary state power, and long enough ago to allow proper study and comparison to be made. Furthermore, each country exhibited similarities in Old Regimes and revolutionary processes and outcomes. Each of the states was wealthy and agrarian, “the revolutionary outcome in each was a centralized, bureaucratic, and mass-incorporating nation-state with enhanced great-power potential incorporation of the New Regimes”.\n\nThis chapter highlights the old regimes in crisis, such as France, China, and Russia. These states set the precedent for old regimes in crisis and help to outline pre-revolutionary conditions and the leading causes. Skocpol states that revolutionary crises are created when the old regimes fail to modernize with the evolving international situation (Skocpol 1979, 48). The reason that the old regimes were in crisis was because the upper classes could not defend against peasant rebellions on a local basis; therefore, they supervise society to maintain order (Skocpol 1979, 48). The landed upper class relied on the monarchical class to bolster their status, prerogatives, and they built their fortune on state services to have such opportunities (Skocpol 1979, 49). Thus, the economic interests of the landed upper classes were in part obstacles to be overcome. These states were caught in a tough situation where the state decided to update their status in the international arena or fix the domestic class structure among the rich and the poor (Skocpol 1979, 50).\n\nThe first state discussed in a domestic crisis is France, this state was one of Skocpol's primary definitions of an old world revolutions. The two themes demonstrated in France's revolution is the rise of bourgeoisie and the emergence of the enlightenment ideology which is the characteristics that defines a revolution (Skocpol, 1979: 47). The first crisis in Frances old regime was the state and Louis XIV the absolute monarchy that led the country (51). The second crisis in the old world regime is the economy. Peasants accounted for 85 percent of the national population of the twenty six million people at the time. The progress of industry relied heavily on peasants fulfilling the labor of the agriculture and the taxation from that agriculture, yet all the money would help fund the wars(54). The third problems were the dominant classes’ jurisdiction and control of the hierarchical structure. There were distinctions between the first class, nobles, and the third estate, depending on those who were privileged and those that weren't (57). It all relied on “proprietary wealth” and taking the form of land exploited through rents from tenants who held or used pieces of domains, farms and other forms of land (59). The divisions between the different estates were the true barrier at the middle level of the social order based largely on wealth and office holding of the noble class over that of the peasantry class (58). The fourth problem with France were the wars and fiscal dilemmas held within the state (60). The monarchy could not financially maintain the military yet alone (IDK what this is supposed to say but not this) not continue to maintain the soldiers' quantity of the military because there weren't enough members of nobility. The last problems were the revolutionary political crisis; the upper nobility would propose new taxes on all lands when funding was needed (64). The dominant class then wanted representative body to advise the king of taxation. The king went against his counsel triggering administrative chaos and military breakdown (64). The people leading the chaos were the rich nobles, non-nobles, and poor country nobles. In 1788 to 1789, the French dominant class was united in wanting a less absolutist more representative national government (65). The absolutist reinforced their advantages against the poorer through political means; the state-enforced taxes hindered the opportunity of the peasants. \nThe second state discussed in chapter two was Manchu China in the 19th century (Skocpol 1979, 67). This civilization was in a tension filled state filled with pressures on the government to provide for the state and conflicts between gaining status in the international arena and the domestic conflicts within the state (67). The second old crisis in the Manchu-China was the agrarian economy and society of villages involved in locally focused marketing networker and imperial state administration that recruited and deployed educated individuals certified by an elaborate examination system (68). The land was owned, rented, bought, and sold in small units to peasants. The population was 80 percent peasant agriculturalists living in villages. Another old crisis occurring in China was the state itself, the emperor ruled an absolute and legally unlimited monarch with several of the imperial clans who clustered around him in support (69). “Each province was divided into smaller unites designated as tao or circuits over which intendent presided, Each tao was made up of a fu and the fu, in turn, were subdivided into departments and hsien (under magistrates) (70). Officials were appointed from the literati degree holder, otherwise known as 2% of the population. The Literati were protected by the imperial officials and these individuals passed their metropolitan examinations (70). After that group came the lower literati who passed basic level examinations. Then the gentry were based on office holding and ownership of surplus land and liquid wealth (71). The gentry lent or rented their land to the peasants that would work the field; supporting the Confucian status-manner (72). The fourth crisis in the old regime was the foreign intrusions and the domestic rebellions (73). China became under extraordinary pressures from imperialist nations abroad, to regulate and expand free trade. This directly affected China's deepening incursions on sovereignty within the state, allowing Britain to further dictate the state. Another problem occurring because of the foreign intrusion was the increase in population growth due to the emergence of industrialism (74). The fourth crisis that the old regime encountered was that the imperial authorities became weaker due to financial and administrative deficiencies in the state (74). Thus, causing the bureaucracy to break pace and disorganizing the authority from the Literati to basic level magistrates supervising a record breaking population (75). The chaos that ensued after the changes of the new imperial figure that invaded China caused Chaos, not only did the western ideology affect China's educational system but it disrespected the Confucianism ideals that China was built upon. The Ch’ing was confronted in the 18th century with peasant based rebellions such as; White Lotus, Taiping, and Nien(75). The fifth crisis that resulted in China's revolution was the loss of resources that created the rebellions because of the economical and population losses caused by massive civil warfare. The last crisis that ensued in old regime, China were the changes in government, the new western style learning for new governmental elite was established in the localities and provinces and in peaking (77). Another change that occurred was the creation of military academies to train officers as well as a new budgeting system that was instituted (78). The last change in government was the creation of representative assemblies in 1908 to support the imperial government. The western ideologies completely rejected the Confucian ideals that were in place for centuries (79).\n\nThe last old world regime in crisis was Russia; they were the last underdeveloped great powers that were bombarded by state change as well as the loss of status in the international arena (Skocpol 1979, 81). The Russian imperial state was in crisis due to their multiple defeats in previous wars. In the 19th century, he state developed a competition to be the dominant power in the European state system (83-84). The population during that time was living in cities was 8 to 10 percent or 60 million (82). During this era, there were two types of landlord/serf relations that prevailed and often combined in one estate or intermixed in one locale; black soil provinces, and infertile soil(83). Those who worked in the black soil provinces performed the services on the lord's demesne for one half or more of each week (83). The second system had hard conditions and made the serfs face primitive conditions making their job difficult. The second crisis was the Crimean debacle and reform of Western Europe during the 19th century (83). Imperial Russia was on their defense when it came to controlling the Russian Sea. Russia appeared on the global sphere to be one of the strongest single powers in 1815 but after 1848 they lost their position as a great power in the international arena (84). The Crimean war handed the severe blow to Russia's strength and further displayed Russia's inferiority to other countries in this moment in time (84). The military defeats made the citizens of the state lose confidence in their government forcing them to reform (85). The first sign of reform was emancipation of the serfs, directly limiting nobility's autocracy, further dissolving the imperial state. The third crisis that occurred was the weakness of the landed nobility; this group was the middle class between the serf economy and the imperial state (85). The Russian dominant class was created with the financial funding of the peasantry through the state, the landed nobility was economically weak and dependent on the imperial authorities to control the state (87). The fourth crisis in the old regime was the state guided industrialization that occurred after the post-Crimean reform era, the goal of the state was to spur industrialization from the upper class and did not come until after some initial experiments’ with laissez faire capitalist policies (90). Russia was open to foreign trade and investment believing that they could acquire modern industrial, transportation materials and techniques to speed up the agricultural process. The state didn't predict the possibility of trade and investments leading to the furtherance of Russia's demise; the agricultural productivity declined, the price for grain dropped, the need for imports and indebtedness grew (90). Russia was further dissolved by the war and military measures cost the state as well as created famines in 1891. The Russian economy was tied to Europe's finances, the western market contracted Russian's industry, and grown rapidly in the 1890s, but the crisis created a long recession. Despite the declining economy, Russia still functioned as a competing Great Power in the European arena (94). Yet, the state still couldn't move forward because of the collapse of the agricultural system. The last crisis that occurred in the old world regime was the impact of war. In the 20th century, Russia was caught in the middle of an “crosscurrent” between the international world and the Europe (94). The states goal was to maintain their power and status as the Great Power and the only way this could be done was through war. The biggest war Russia ever became involved in was World War 1, engulfing all of the European states forcing Russia to protect their status and assets (95). The consequences led Russia further downward because of the military defeats, economic and administrative chaos (96).\n\nAnother important aspect of this chapter was Meiji Restoration and the Prussian Reform Movement (100-111). A series of states (France, Prussia, Japan, China and Russia) were subjected to military pressures from more financially stable states abroad and all states encountered societal political crisis (110). France, Russia, and China were the states to be immersed into the social revolutions but Prussia and Japan adapted to the pressures by adapting through reforms given by the authoritarian figures (110). The precedent of Social Revolutions began in France, Russia, and China through the internal and external crisis seen at the time. The surfacing of the(se) “revolutionary political crisis” were created by the nobilities control on the agrarian structure of taxation on the old regimes limiting the peasant's opportunities (111).\n\nChapter 3 analyzes the situation of the peasantry and its contribution to the great Revolutions. Attention is given to the conditions for and against peasant insurrections. Skocpol states that societal political crises alone were not sufficient enough to produce social-revolutionary situations in France, Russia, and China. Urbanites and peasantry were dependent on each other. Peasant revolts have been crucial in almost all successful revolutions to date, especially in the French, Russian, and Chinese Revolutions. This is not surprising since social revolutions have usually occurred in agrarian countries where peasants made up the major producing class. Peasant revolts destroyed the old agrarian class relations and weakened the military and political supports for liberalism or counterrevolution. Successful revolts by urban workers may not have been necessary in the Revolutions, but peasant revolts against landlords were definitely a necessary ingredient in all three Revolutions. The peasant revolts of the three Revolutions were all directed particularly against landlords. Skocpol defines peasants as primary agricultural cultivators. Because of political and social marginality as well as socio-economic immobility, peasants must bear the burden of combinations of taxes, rents, interest rates, and discriminatory prices. They always have grounds for rebellion against landlords, state agents, and merchants who exploit them. The issue at hand is the degree to which grievances that are always at least implicitly present can be collectively perceived and acted upon. Peasants struggled for concrete goals such as access to more land, or freedom from claims on their surpluses.\n\nMain points of Chapter 3:\n\n\n-primary agricultural cultivators\n\n-always have ground for rebellion against landlords, state agents and merchants\n\n-always exploited\n\n\n-peasant revolts are crucial in almost all successful revolutions to date\n\n-societal political crises alone were not sufficient enough to produce social-revolutionary situations in France, Russia, and China\n\n-urbanites and peasantry dependent on each other\n\n\n-Old Regime\n\n--> landed-commercial dominant class has power within semi-bureaucratic absolute monarchy\n\n--> agrarian economy growing but no breakthrough to capitalist agriculture\n\n--> villages were autonomous under supervision of royal officials\n\n--> peasant smallholders owned less than 40% of land but worked 80% or more in small plots\n\n--> individual property was established, but peasant community opposed seigneurs because of their collection of dues and tithes\n\n-Reaction (157)\n\n--> peasant revolts against seigneurial claims\n\n\n-Old Regime\n\n--> landed nobility has little political power within highly bureaucratic state\n\n--> extensive growth in agrarian economy, but little development in core regions\n\n--> villages sovereign under control of tsarist bureaucracy\n\n--> strong community of peasants based upon collective ownership \"(obshchina)\"\n\n--> peasants own 60% or more of land and control process of production\n\n--> pay rents and redemption payments\n\n-Reaction (157)\n\n--> peasant revolts against all private landed property\n\n\n-Old Regime\n\n--> landed-commercial dominant class has power within semi-bureaucratic absolutist state\n\n--> no developmental breakthrough in agrarian economy; near limits of growth\n\n--> peasants 50% or more of land and work almost all land in small plots\n\n--> pay rents to gentry\n\n--> no peasant community\n\n-Reaction (157)\n\n--> spread of agrarian disorder, but no peasant revolts against landlords\n\nChapter 3, Section 1: \"Peasants Against Seigneurs (French Revolution)\"\n\nChapter 3 is divided into four subsections; the first is titled \"Peasants Against Seigneurs in the French Revolution\" (112–127). In this section, structural conditions (118–120), the impact of the political crisis of 1789 (121-125), and the limits of the French peasant revolution (126–127) are discussed. On August 4, 1789, members of the constituent assembly denounced and renounced “feudal” structures of French society and politics. But these liberal nobles and Third Estate representatives assembled at Versailles would never have initiated these reforms had not an agrarian revolt against the seigneurial system been present, forcing the reluctant hand of the nobles and representatives. Peasant resistance to the payment of dues and tithes, as well as escalating violence against \"chateaux\" and individuals, forced the men of property and privilege at Versailles to make concessions. It is believed that without the peasant revolution, the Constituent Assembly would most likely not have struck so severely against the feudal regime. Furthermore, without the aid of the peasant revolution, the Revolution may never have developed beyond constitutional reforms. An agrarian social structure peculiar to France made possible the potential for the peasant revolts that erupted in 1789. Socioeconomic and political conditions influenced the ability of peasants to react against exploitation. Unlike the serfs of Eastern Europe, the French peasantry owned a substantial portion of the land of France and therefore controlled the use of most of the land involved in agricultural production.\n\nChapter 3, Section 2: \"The Revolution of the Obshchinas (Russian Revolution)\"\n\nTurning from revolutionary France to Russia, the second subsection is titled \"The Revolution of the Obshchinas: Peasant Radicalism in Russia\" (128–139). In this section, the agrarian conditions after the emancipation (128–132), the impact of the political crises of 1905 and 1917 (133–136), and the leveling outcome in Russia (136–139) are discussed. The French and Russian Revolutions shared similar factors: rentier agriculture, peasant community structures, and the breakdown of the repressive machine. Serfdom was considered the basis of the Russian autocracy. Chained to estate lands, communities of peasants were held collectively responsible for payments and labor service to nobles. Once the Imperial regime was established, heavy taxes and provision of military recruits were added to the obligations of the serfs. Peasants could express no more than sporadic, localized resistance. The 1861 “Emancipation” of the serfs was initiated by the tsar and his bureaucrats. Its purpose was to improve the social stability and political spirit of the Imperial system. The Emancipation set the stage for the agrarian revolution that uprooted the pre-revolutionary social order in 1917. The institutional basis of the Emancipation was based on the \"obshchina\": a village commune that controlled property in land and distributed access to it among individual households. What the peasants wanted the most out of the Russian Revolution and what they immediately achieved was possession of the land and the available means for working it. It was the \"obshchina’s\" collective interest in expanding its landholdings, as well as its weakening of private property rights, that contributed to the Russian peasant revolution and its accomplishments. \nThe accomplishments of the 1917 Russian peasant revolution contrast in important ways with the accomplishments of the French peasant revolution of 1789. In France, the rebellious peasants abolished seigneurial claims and controls. But the peasants respected private property and did not attack it, including large estates and rich peasant farms. In contrast, the Russian \"obshchina\" did not legitimate private landed property as such, but rather believed that “all land belonged to God.” The only ones who came out winning big within the French peasantry were those rich and middle peasants who already owned their own land. The peasant revolution in Russia, however, not only abolished rental claims of landlords but also seized and redistributed most private landed properties. This benefited the less well-to-do and land-poor peasants. Although the accomplishments between these two peasant revolution contrast in important ways, the processes of the French and Russian peasant revolutions were similar in many ways. One vital similarity was that in both Russia and France, the peasant village assembly provided the organizational basis for spontaneous and autonomous revolts. In both cases locally controlled peasant revolts were influenced by society-wide political crises within the context of which they occurred. An internal political development was the primary revolutionary crisis in France, first impinged upon the villages when the king called for elections to the Estates General. The revolutionary political crisis in Russia was the sudden breakup of the huge armies that had been mobilized to fight World War I in Russia. It had come in the midst of national defeat in a massive and modern war. Essential to the success of the Russian peasant revolution, the breakup also influenced the shape of the peasant accomplishments. Unlike in France where the village assemblies were convened and led by the usual (older as well as richer) community influentials, in Russia they were led by younger men, with guns and ideas brought home from their wartime military experience.\n\nChapter 3, Section 3: \"Two Counterpoints (English and German Revolutions)\" \nThe third subsection of this chapter is titled \"Two Counterpoints: The Absence of Peasant Revolts in the English and German Revolutions\" (140–147). The English Parliamentary Revolution (140–143) and the failed German Revolution of 1848–50 (144–147) are briefly discussed in this section. The peasant revolts that greatly contributed to the French and Russian social revolutions were able to occur because both Old Regimes were prone to agrarian upheavals against landlords. Agrarian class relations and local political arrangements in France and Russia provided solidarity and autonomy to peasant communities, allowing them to strike out against the property and privileges of the landlords. But such favorable conditions to peasant revolts were not present in all countries. This absence could account for why a successful social revolution could not occur, even with a societal political crisis present. In this section of the chapter, positive cases for social revolutions are contrasted to cases in which social revolutions were not successful. The seventeenth-century English Revolution and the German Revolution of 1848–50 are two such cases. Their characteristics and outcomes were quite different: the English Revolution was a successful \"political\" revolution, while the German Revolution was a \"failed\" social revolution. Both cases were prevented from becoming successful social-revolutionary transformations. This was largely because agrarian class and political structures of the English and German Old Regimes gave ruling power to landlords and not to peasant communities. The significant point in this subsection is that, unlike France and Russia, English and German landlords couldn't be successfully challenged from below, even during political crises.\n\nChapter 3, Section 4: \"Peasant and Gentry (Chinese Revolution)\"\n\nThe last and final subsection of this chapter is titled \"Peasant Incapacity and Gentry Vulnerability in China\" (147–154). This section turns to the third positive case of social revolution and discusses China's structural conditions (148–150) and patterns of agrarian unrest (150–154). The Chinese Revolution is the most obviously peasant-based social revolution of the trio (France, Russia, China) presented in this book. Despite some similarities to France and Russia, the agrarian class and local political structures of old-regime China resembled those of England and Prussia. Although a peasant revolution against landlords did eventually occur in China as in France and Russia, the peasants of China lacked the solidarity and autonomy that allowed the peasant revolutions in France and Russia to react quickly to the collapse of the central governments of the Old Regimes. Unlike the French and Russian agrarian revolution, the Chinese agrarian revolution was more protracted. In sum, in Chapter 3 Skocpol argued that “agrarian sociopolitical structures that facilitated widespread peasant revolts against landlords were the sufficient distinctive causes of social revolutionary situations commencing in France, 1789, Russia, 1917, and China, 1911” (154).\n\nWhile Part 1 of the book analyzed the causes of societal crises, Part 2 proceeds to show what changed in the French, Chinese, and Russian Revolutions and why those changes emerged from these social revolutionary situations. The second part of the book is titled \"Outcomes of Social Revolutions in France, Russia, and China\" (161-173) and explains shared patterns across all three Revolutions as well as key variations among the Revolutions. The second part of the book is divided into four chapters. Chapter 4, \"What Changed and How: A Focus on State Building\", is the first chapter within the second part of the book. This chapter analyzes the processes and outcomes of the Revolutions by focusing on the struggles surrounding the creation of new state organizations within the social revolutionary contexts. Each Revolution is examined from its original crisis of the Old Regime to the created sociopolitical patterns of the New Regime. These changes are followed according to the emergence and consolidation of new state organizations and the deployment of state power in each revolutionized society.Why is this approach taken to analyze the outcomes of the Revolutions? The reason for a focus on state building is because as Samuel P. Huntington writes: “A complete revolution involves...the creation and institutionalization of a new political order” (163). The Revolutions were only fully achieved when new state organizations were created among the conflicts of the revolutionary situations. Social revolutions not only affect social and cultural life, but also make changes in the structure and function of states. Therefore, an emphasis is placed on state building because of the importance of political consolidation and of state structures in determining revolutionary outcomes.\n\nMain Points of Chapter 4:\n\n\n-State building within the social revolutionary contexts determined revolutionary outcomes\n\n-Revolutions only fully achieved when new state organizations were created\n\n\n-Revolutionary ideologies were key to the nature of all revolutionary outcomes (169-171)\n\n-Peasant revolts\n\n-Landed upper classes lost control of peasants\n\n-State-building leaderships\n\n-New state infrastructure is more centralized and rationalized\n\n--> Greater popular incorporation into state-run affairs\n\n--> More effective in society and more powerful against international competitors\n\n\n-France and Russia\n\n--> Professionalized and hierarchical state\n\n-France\n\n--> Professional-bureaucratic state\n\n--> National markets and capitalist private property\n\n-Russia and China\n\n--> Rise to party-led state organizations\n\n--> Development-oriented party-states\n\n--> Control over national economy\n\n-China\n\n--> Highly centralized and bureaucratic\n\n--> Party or army organizations asserted control over all society and state administration\n\nChapter 4, Section 1: \"Political Leaderships\"\n\nA short and concise chapter, Chapter 4 is only divided into 2 subsections. The first subsection is titled \"Political Leaderships\" (164-168). Skocpol views the political leaderships primarily as state builders rather than as representatives of classes. Social-revolutionary crises aroused the political and class struggles of France, Russia, and China, ultimately leading to structural transformations. All three Revolutions shared important patterns of change. Agrarian class relations were transformed through peasant revolts against landlords, bureaucratic and “mass-incorporating” national states replaced autocratic and proto-bureaucratic monarchies, and the prerevolutionary landed upper classes no longer retained exclusive privileges in society and politics. Under the Old Regimes, the special privileges and institutional power bases of the landed upper classes were considered hindrances to full state bureaucratization as well as to direct mass political incorporation. Political conflicts and class overthrows removed these hindrances. The landed upper classes lost control of the peasants and shares of the agrarian surpluses through local and regional quasi-political institutions. During the same time, political leaderships started to emerge and were challenged to build new state organizations to consolidate the Revolutions. Because these emerging political leaderships could mobilize lower-class groups that had previously been excluded from national politics, such as urban workers or the peasantry, these leaderships were able to successfully meet the challenges of political consolidation. Thus, in all three Revolutions, the landed upper class lost out to both the benefit of lower class groups and to new state infrastructure. In each New Regime, there was much greater popular incorporation into the state-run affairs of the nation. The new state organizations produced during the Revolutions were more centralized and rationalized than those of the Old Regime. Therefore, they were more effective within society and more powerful against international competitors. \nYet, of course there were also variations within the outcomes of the Revolutions. The Russian and Chinese Revolutions gave rise to party-led state organizations and resembled each other as development-oriented party-states. These organizations asserted control over the entire national economies of the two countries. In France, however, a professional-bureaucratic state coexisted with national markets and capitalist private property. The Russian regime though, exhibited some important similarities to France. Both Revolutions gave rise to a professionalized and hierarchical state aligned to the administrative supervision of social groups. In China, a state was generated that was highly centralized and in some ways thoroughly bureaucratic. Unlike in France and Russia, the Party or army organizations served not only as means of control over the state administration and society, but also as agents of popular mobilization. The most striking contrast to France and Russia has been the mobilization of peasants for rural development. In sum, the revolutionary leaderships that were produced during the French, Russian, and Chinese Revolutions were state-building leaderships. They created administrative and military organizations and political institutions that replaced the pre-revolutionary monarchies.\n\nChapter 4, Section 2: \"Revolutionary Ideologies\"\n\nThe second subsection within Chapter 4 is titled \"The Role of the Revolutionary Ideologies\" (169-171). By examining the role of revolutionary ideologies, this subsection aims to answer why revolutionary leaderships ended up creating the specific kinds of centralized and bureaucratic state structures that they did. It is often argued that the ideologies to which revolutionary leaderships are committed to provide the key to the nature of revolutionary outcomes. It is further believed that ideologies also reveal the strategies that revolutionary leaders followed as they acted to produce the outcomes. Revolutionary ideologies and people committed to them were necessary ingredients in the social revolutions of China, Russia, and France. In short, existing structural conditions have greatly limited ideologically oriented leaderships in revolutionary crises. Thus they have typically ended up accomplishing very different tasks and producing quite different kinds of new regimes from those they originally ideologically intended.\n\nThe French Revolution was formed by the outcome of the revolutionary crisis where the individual's independence and liberties seemed unfeasible and after the masses mobilized together their goal was centralize the state (Skocpol 1979, 174). This chapter highlights the French Revolution and the developments that occurred to create modern-day France.\n\nThe first section questions if the revolution was meant primarily for the bourgeois revolution. The author criticizes Marxist “social interpretation”(174) which held that the revolution was led by the upper-middle class (bourgeoisie) to replace feudalism and gentry with capitalism instead (174). Marxist highlights the bourgeoisie creating a transition from the feudal hierarchy towards capitalist mode of production to rid the system that prevents the individuals within it to move up on the hierarchy (175). Skocpol offers more depth within the section stating that revolution and economic development occur because the political elites didn't take control over the economy to create industrialization; instead they strengthened private property ownership further (175). Not to mention that the regional, estate, and guild class had been removed from the national market. Over time, France did eventually become a capitalist industrial government (175-176). The men who dominated post revolutionary France were not industrial class who were better fit to equip this new governmental state(176). But they were bureaucrats, soldiers, and owners of real estate, thus giving all classes an opportunity to be a part of the state (176). The base of the bourgeoisie were still wealthy, ambitious, and where in control over the private property. Yet, this new state was still agrarian despite the fact that they were modernized to an industrial and capitalist society (176-177). After 1789, the society barely picked up their economic situation after the revolution halting progress. The situation continued to deteriorate, after 1814, the French new industry couldn't compete with Britain, they lacked connection, and “know how” (177). The state was in a mode of celebration because they accomplished the resolving of domestic, military, and removal of the feudal system (177-179). Domestic problems in the state where resolving themselves when the bourgeoisie elites were conquered by the new bourgeoisie (178). It is also important to acknowledge France's accomplishment of participating in European wars from 1792 to 1814. The French Revolution accomplished the removal of the feudal system The new state was ruled by “bourgeoisie only” because it simplified and improved property rights into an individualistic and exclusive form of private property (179). This new state was capitalist explicitly by clearing away corporate and provincial barriers and expanded competitive and national market economy in France. The French Revolution in this section attempts to reveal that this historical event can be relatable or caused a bourgeois revolution (179-180). \nThe second section highlights the 1789 effects of Frances social revolutionary crisis (181). The peasant revolts were the key to revolution, and the key to change in France (181). The dominant classes were divided from the very beginning over what kind of king should represent the French state (182). This division established the creation of the Estates General, which was only known as only as historical precedent. No real change came of the creation of this assembly because the 3rd estate had only 1 vote, causing the other 2 estates; nobility and gentry to ban together against them (182). The existing political privileges would be at stake if the provincial estates, parliaments, and voting by order would be sacrificed for the new national assembly that became implemented for show (182). The national assembly benefitted from the Municipal Revolution, they were given more rights to decide on specific decisions. The assembly was orientated towards the approval of society and was used as a political strategy that had no administrative power (182). Another outcome of the revolution was the creation of the French local authorities; they represented the different interest of the state (182). The revolutionary liberal government that emerged in France received its origin from English parliamentary government. Another highlight of the French Revolution was the impact of the peasant revolts, thus created by the dominants control over the administrative decisions of the state, denying the lower class their autonomy and means to survive (183). The repercussions of the peasant revolts were the appearance of a uniformed, well balanced administration, and modernized legal system that outlined the modern France of the 1790s. The peasant revolts caused further separation of the classes (183).\n\nThe third section in the Modern State Edifice in France was war, the Jacobins, and the Napoleons (185). This section is about the three figures that were an intricate part in France's Revolutionary process. The declaration of war on Austria in 1792 was the first international conflict that led to the liberal phase of 1789-91, this act set the process of government centralization (185). Thus leading to the discontent of the state and mobilization for revolutionary dictatorship hoping that the declaration on Austria would unify the state together, but the state further resented each other further (187). The state would also become more knowledgeable on the political awareness of the happenings in the state. The discontent of the state's citizens and the bombardment of other international states competing for the administrative control of France caused further tension(187). France the decided to create another form of government reformed in an attempt to protect the state creating a more arbitrary system as well as dictatorial (188). The reform of the state caused the army to expand enormously as well as enlarging the committee on Public Safety. Despite the new army that was created, the troops framework of the line armies did not completely dissolve in 1789-92 (191). After the revolution the state building commenced on land warfare, the Montegnards fell under the dictatorial rule of the committee of public safety the armies of the post-revolutionary France turned to undermine the confidence of France and defeats to victories (191). The dissatisfaction of the Montegnards dictatorship led to the summer of 1794, Robespierre and his lieutenants were sent to the guillotine as the convention revoked their support for the Committee of Dictatorship (191). Yes, the Montegnards did provide leadership to allow peasants to purchase land but they still were in favor or private property rights (191). The Montegnards were examples of proletariat s class in the time of Revolutionary France. The Montagnards and the Committee of Public Safety both lacked unity and both eventually fell apart by the spring of 1794 (192). The goal of the state was to search for stability, this was done through the pro-revolutionary France who became more centralized and hands on than ever before (192-193). Napoleons’ rise of leadership over France was meant as a means of authoritarian rule that would provide stability among the state (194). Yet, Napoleons constant need to conquer the European continent would be the French states demise (195). Napoleon progressed the French state farther than Montegnards, and Jacobin. Yet, Napoleon like the other leaders was removed by foreign intervention after the military collapsed (196).\n\nThe last section of the “modern state edifice” in France was the post revolutionary France's new regime. There were several changes implemented on the state and organizations within France such as: the army, the civil state, and the state in society (196-205). The army became professionalized and the emergence of the national army. The army was originally 90 percent noble before 1789 but after an influx of men could join without being noble (196-197). Napoleon Bonaparte helped to organize the army and helped to give soldiers rank based on experience and education rather than class. The civil state changed due to the French Revolution, it became less monarchical and authoritative (198). They became a more democratic government with bureaucratic administrative qualities providing citizens with equal opportunities in the running of the state (198). The state in society had a stronger grip on functions and organizations within the state, such as education, settlements within the church, and the intrusion of the state (202). The French Revolution created a new coexisting society that was centralized and professional-bureaucratic state with a society dominated by small, medium, and large owners of private property (204). This was done to maintain social order and provide more autonomous opportunities. The French Revolution swept away the monarchical dictatorship that only provided opportunities to the rich and modernizing France was given equal opportunities to all with a democratic government with bureaucratic organization (205).\n\nChapter six of States and Social Revolutions is entitled The Emergence of a Dictatorial Party-State in Russia. The Russian Revolution is known to be the most complete or thoroughgoing of the modern social revolutions. In the matter of a few months industrial workers, peasants, and soldiers came together in revolts, undermined the capitalist classes and sealed the fate of the tsarist regime. The leaders of this revolution were devoted to socialisms ideas of equality and proletarian democracy. However, these ideas ended up creating a centralized bureaucratic party-state that later came to push hasty national industrialization through terror tactics. When the Russian Revolution finally broke out, it was when the tsarist state had already been destroyed by the seemingly never-ending involvement and defeats of World War I.\n\nDilemmas for the Provisional Government: Various attempts were being made by leaders of political parties in 1917 to stabilize the Russian Revolution in a liberal-democratic manner. “The Provisional Government declared itself head of government…until a Constituent Assembly could be elected to create a new constitution”. The tsarist regime was effectively replaced with a network of councils, of which the Provisional Government relied most on the Petrograd Soviet. However, as problems continued to pile up, it became evident that the liberal system was even less capable of dealing with them than the old autocracy was. By 1917 Russia was experiencing severe bankruptcy and their only solution was to stay in the war so their western allies would continue to provide them with support. As the war was kept in play by the Provisional Government, peasants continued to take over rights and lands of the gentry, popular revolts gained power, and the soviets began to involve themselves in administrative matters more so than ever before. The Provisional Government had neither the authority nor the power to end the attacks on the privileged, and soon after the February Revolution much of the Imperial administration, such as the police, disintegrated. From this point on, it was uphill for the peasants, workers and soldiers, who were able to revolt in ways they could not before. At this point, the only hope for national order was in the hands of the various political parties fighting for popular support.\n\nThe Bolshevik Struggle to Rule: In the spring and summer of 1917 the Bolshevik Party, which was initially the smallest and the most socialist party, was able to gain popular support through rebellions calling for “peace, land, break, workers’ control, and all power to the soviets”. These tactics helps tem win the elected majorities.\n\nThe Party Claims Exclusive Sovereignty\n\nState Controls in the Economy\nThe Stalinist “Revolution from Above”\n\nThe Peasant Contradiction\n\nThe Commitment to Rapid Industrialization and Forced Collectivization\n\nThe Fate of Workers and Peasants\n\nHierarchy and Coercion: In the 1930s preferential treatment of officials and skilled workers became much more common. With this, the Soviet regime also began to lean on tactic of terror and coercion (secret police surveillance, prison camps, etc.) in order to rule its people, eventually leading to the “Great Purges”.\n\nChapter analyzes developments in China from the aftermath of 1911 through 1949 to the 1960s. The Chapter is divided into four subsections and the first one is titled \"The Social Revolutionary Situation After 1911\" (237-241). China's warlord context and the survival of the local gentry are discussed in this section. The second subsection is titled \"The Rise and Decline of the Urban-Based Kuomintang\" (242-251). Its alliance and break with the communists and its failure to consolidate national control are further discussed in this section. The third subsection within Chapter 7 is titled \"The Communists and the Peasants\" (252-262). The peasant-based red army, the second united front and its cadre recruitment and administrative control, and the Party's mass mobilization for production, war, and land revolution are examined in this particular section. The fourth and final subsection is titled \"The New Regime\" (263-283) and examines a strengthened state bureaucracy, a Communist China and Soviet Russia, a balanced strategy for national development, and political coordination, mass mobilization, and egalitarianism. Reasons for China's distinctive outcomes are also examined in the section.\n\nSimilar to the French and Russian Revolutions, the Chinese Revolution was initiated by the breakdown of an autocratic and semi-bureaucratic Old Regime. A New Regime more centralized, mass-incorporating, and more rationalized and bureaucratic than the previous Old Regime was produced. As stated in Chapter 3, social Revolutions in France and Russia depended upon the occurrence of peasant revolts. Revolutionary state organizations were primarily built up with the aid of urban popular support and imposed through administrative hierarchies upon the rural areas. Unlike the Revolutions of France and Russia, the peasants in the Chinese Revolution ended up providing both the revolutionary force and the organized popular basis for the solidification of revolutionary state power. The result was a New Regime devoted to promoting participation and resistant to routinized hierarchical domination by bureaucratic officials. The differences that set the Chinese Revolution apart from the Russian and French Revolutions lie in the particular characteristics of the social revolutionary situation and the surviving characteristics of the Old Regime. When the Imperial state in China fell, gentry landlords remained established in the rural localities, and warlords held a strong influence at provincial and regional levels. Therefore, revolutionary state-builders faced dire obstacles. The Chinese Revolution could only be completed when revolutionary leaders learned to tap the rebellious, productive and political energies of the peasant majority.\n\nMain points of Chapter 7:\n\n\n-party state\n\n-decentralized\n\n-mass-incorporating\n\n-more rationalized and bureaucratic\n\n-devoted to promoting participation\n\n-resistant to routinized hierarchical domination\n\n\n-gentry landlords remained established\n\n-warlords continued to hold strong influence\n\n-mobilization of peasant majority toppled down these surviving characteristics (252-262)\n\n-->peasant-based red army\n\nSkocpol explains social revolutions as being based on four factors: (1) state social structures, (2) international competitive pressures and (3) international demonstration effects, and (4) class relations. Her argument is influenced by the Marxist notion of the class struggle, but she differs from Marx as she sees the state as an autonomous actor within society. Her argument is even more powered by the structuralist argument that revolution is a dysfunctional response to a destabilization of social system schools. The book is also state centric (as shown by the very title of the book). By analyzing how the social institution of the state changed and influenced the social change, the book can also be placed within the historical institutionalism paradigm.\n\nShe stresses that international-scale actions (like threats or outcomes of war, and political and economic inequalities) have a major effect on domestic events (like revolutions). This effect can be explained as the outside effects lead to increased destabilization and political crises (financial crisis, elite divisions, mobilization of groups sensing political opportunity) which in turn increases the likelihood that revolutionary forces will arise and act. Skocpol notes that while elites are important, ordinary citizens are also vital, as supported by the fact that most successful revolutions were aided by urban and peasants mobilizations.\n\nCriticism of Skocpol's book centers around her deemphasis of agency (role of individuals and ideology) and her mixed use of comparative methodological strategies.\n\nIn her book “States and Social Revolutions,” Theda Skocpol explains the social structural reasoning behind why and how revolutions occur. Her work is based on the work of Barrington Moore, who she was once a student of. Her theory created a new avenue for exploring revolutions and the reasons behind why they occur. Although her book is extremely influential and enlightening, many have found aspects of her theory that they disagree with or find qualms with.\n\nAccording to Peter Manicas, Skocpol denies claims by historians that social revolutions should be analyzed as separate and distinct movements. She also denies claims that try to over generalize what makes a revolution. Peter Manicas says that Skocpol's work is successful at creating a theory that uses generalizations but is sensitive to differences between states and situations.\n\nManicas says that Skocpol's intention in “States and Social Revolutions” is to “widen the scope of structuralist analysis beyond the locus of “’conventional’ Marxian analysis.” According to Manicas, Skocpol denies claims by historians that social revolutions should be analyzed as separate and distinct movements. She also denies claims that try to over generalize what makes a revolution. Manicas says that Skocpol’s work is successful at creating a theory that uses generalizations but is sensitive to differences between states and situations.\n\nManicas’ says that Skocpol's “treatment of the state reflects much of the current controversy and represents a decided advance over many accounts,” Skocpol is very careful to state the differences between modern nation-states and what can be classified as “empires” or monarchical states. She also focuses on the importance in differences between external characteristics of different states that may be experiencing revolutions and contrasts successful revolutions—i.e. France, Russia and China—with unsuccessful revolutions like Prussia and Japan.\n\nSkocpol's theories, according to Manicas, are causal in nature; she explains one event by identifying it as a direct result of another event or phenomenon. She does suggest, however, that there are alternatives and there are times when one event does not necessarily lead to the result expected. She argues that existing structures in society are a result of the intentional actions of humans and a result of the transformations humans have made to them preceding the current situation in any given state. Skocpol also argues that these changes and transformations over time are not made deliberately, they simply occur according to the circumstances surrounding a state at any given time period.\n\nManicas says that Skocpol's causal argument is insufficient in the explanation of revolutions because she contradicts herself. According to Manicas, Skocpol puts more emphasis on structure than she does on group efforts, although she does cite the importance of group efforts. However, this does not mean that these group efforts were voluntary or conscious. Manicas brings to light the example of the French Revolution. Skocpol says that the convening of the Estates General in 1789 was essential for the start of the French Revolution. This “is not to say that the king intended to start a revolution.” According to Marinas, “to say this is also to say that the ‘causal arguments’ ...are not sufficient to explain the French Revolution...they leave out precisely what one needs in order to explain the French Revolution, or indeed, to explain any historical event.”\n\nSkocpol’s book “States and Social Revolutions” gives an understanding of the similarities and differences between the structures of prerevolutionary and postrevolutionary societies in each of the revolutions she looks at. Skocpol also shows the connections these states had with the international realm and how these affected the internal structures as well as the public and the revolutionary changes.\n\nAlthough Skocpol argues against the use of generalizations in historical explanation, she uses some generalizations herself. Manicas says that the use of the term “revolution” is in itself a generalization. In the end of her book, Skocpol points out all the generalizations she uses and admits that they cannot be used to explain all modern revolutions beyond the French, Russian and Chinese. This is because causes for revolution vary due to historical and international circumstances. A second reason Skocpol point to is that “patterns of revolutionary causation and outcomes are necessarily affected by world-historical changes in the fundamental structures and bases of state power as such.”\n\nManicas argues that Skocpol does not explain why the revolutions in her book happened, but she offers a structural analysis for the understanding of these revolutions. According to Manicas, “history and the social sciences have distinct interests and tasks.” Social scientists attempt to better our understanding of societies in the past, present and future. Historians, in contrast, explain pivotal points in history. The distinction between history and social science is, according to Manicas, “not in terms of time, but in terms of task.” \n\nDwight Billings relates Skocpol to Marx. He argues that Skocpol's theory is more similar to Marxism than it is to the other three theories she criticizes in her book. Despite this, her “stress on the potential autonomy of the state avoids the ‘class struggle reductionism’ of classical Marxism.” \n\nAccording to Steve Pfaff, Skocpol’s book “States and Social Revolutions” created “a distinctive genre of neo-Weberian state-society analysis and, more broadly, served as signature work in the new historical and comparative subfields in sociology and comparative politics.” He says that Skocpol presents revolutionary urban middle class in each of the states she studies as “political entrepreneurs” because they take on the reigns of the revolution after the peasant class has successfully weakened the ruling government.\n\nUnlike previous studies of revolutions, Skocpol's book focuses on the importance of structural conditions within a state over the ideological motives behind a revolution. For Skocpol, ideology was simply a means to an end. She asserts that ideologies like Marxism–Leninism “were instrumental: useful to the extent that they were idealistic and universalistic, offering rhetoric and idioms for popular mobilization, and justifying ruthless means in the pursuit of higher ends.” Skocpol overlooks the real purpose of ideologies and only focuses on their instrumental uses. She ignores the differences between ideologies and puts them all in the same boat as instruments of revolution. Pfaff says, “In many instances, it appears as if ideology really did influence the decisions that revolutionary elites made, particularly after they seized power and could implement their ideas of social transformation.” \n\nPfaff also says that Skocpol focuses too much on big picture characteristics of revolutions and does not say anything about individual motives or how collective mobilization began in the first place. She is vague about revolutionary actors, labeling them in terms of classes. Pfaff believes that Skocpol's revision of class based explanation of revolutions, “it would be more persuasive if collective action were explained and not simply treated as an independent variable.”\n\nSkocpol also argues that successful revolutions “paved the way for centralized, rational bureaucratic administration in the countries she studied.” According to Pfaff, many scholars have argued “while social revolutions removed the old governing class that was frequently an obstacle to significant administrative reforms, they often failed to deliver the degree of rational bureaucratic administration they promised.” In the case of the French Revolution, Skocpol claims that the revolution removed “medieval rubbish” and allowed modern bureaucratization to be created. It has been found, however, that there were “prerevolutionary trends towards greater administrative efficiency that, in some cases, may have been more disrupted by revolution than accelerated.”\n\nSkocpol's book, according to Pfaff, is a clearly identifiable as a product of the politics of the 1970s. She “helped launch a new generation of comparative research on the largest and most consequential of historical questions.” Pfaff goes on to say, even if Skocpol didn't explain the causes that might have triggered state crisis and the mobilization of the people, “and if, in its enthusiasm for revolution, it overestimated the gains of revolutionary transformation, the book nevertheless deserves its place among the canonical works of comparative and historical research.” \n\nIn Michael Richards’ review of “States and Social Revolutions,” he says that it is rare that a singular social revolution is studied along with the discussion of a theory of social revolutions. Barrington Moore was the first to make a significant contribution to this kind of writing. Theda Skocpol's book, however, does something similar, but is “a more carefully circumscribed effort,” focusing on three countries rather than six as Moore did and is “less sweeping in its conclusions.” \n\nRichards commends Skocpol for choosing to focus her book on three revolutions rather than bringing to light a large number of successful and unsuccessful revolutions “in hopes of achieving statistical validity or in the expectation of being able to explain a number of related phenomena.” Like Peter Manicas, Richards also finds Skocpol's refusal to create a general theory for all revolutions commendable. According to Richards, Skocpol “recognizes the limitations of comparative study and the dangers of fitting events into relatively inflexible categories.”\n\nSimilarly to Pfaff, McNeill believes Skocpol implicitly repudiates “the role of personalities in affecting the revolutionary process she analyzes.” However, unlike Pfaff, McNeill sees this as essential to her argument. To include such a variable would, according to McNeill, “spoil the sociology she seeks to discover in human affairs.”\n\nJasper and Goodwin believe Skocpol's book was, like the works of many sociologists in the 70s, a result of her disappointment with the lack of revolutionary success in the United States and Britain. According to Jasper and Goodwin, Skocpol articulated the message many had been thinking—that the actions and the ideologies prove meaningless without the proper causes for revolution being present.\n\nJeff Goodwin argues, in his own analysis of “States and Social Revolutions,” that Skocpol's fame comes in large part, not from a substantial number of people reading her book, but from a small number of “designated readers” critiquing her book and spreading what they believe to be her main ideas. Goodwin says, “A good part of Skocpol’s fame is due to the wide diffusion of several misformulations of some key ideas.” Goodwin explains three major “misformulations” scholars have made about “States and Social Revolutions.”\n\nThe first misinterpretation of Skocpol's book says she makes the point that a revolution or a rebellions success depends solely on state institutions. According to Goodwin, however, Skocpol's argument is more complex: it states that the French, Russian and Chinese revolutions are a result of state institutions becoming more susceptible to collapse due to outside influence as well as peasant rebellion.\n\nA second misperception of “States and Social Revolutions” claims that Skocpol denotes the relevance of ideology in a revolution, an argument made by Steve Pfaff, as mentioned earlier. What Skocpol means to argue, Goodwin says, is that no singular group consciously brought on the revolution.\n\nA third and final argument people have claimed Skocpol to make in “States and Social Revolutions” is that a general theory on revolutions can be made simply through the comparison of a select group of revolutions. Goodwin, like Richards, says Skocpol's book does not try to create an overarching theory of revolution by using the three examples of revolutions. To the contrary, “she explicitly warns that her conjunctural explanation for social revolutions in this particular context cannot be mechanically extended to others.” \n\nHimmelstein and Kimmel claim to find “Tocquevillian” tendencies within Skocpol's argument, pinning the roots of her theory to “the spirit of Alexis de Tocqueville.” Similarly to Tocqueville, Skocpol “is concerned with the relations between the state as an autonomous institution and society.\" She sees political centralization as a consequence of revolution. Although less obviously than Tocqueville, Skocpol “presents the irony of revolutions made in the name of freedom but culminating in a much strengthened state.” Himmelstein and Kimmel applaud Skocpol's ability to combine Tocquevillian views of the state to Marxian class based ideology.\n\nSimilarly to Pfaff and Goodwin mentioned earlier, Himmelstein and Kimmel see Skocpol's minimal focus on “how human beings actually make a revolution,” problematic. Skocpol's denial of the idea of people voluntarily starting a revolution leads her to forget the importance of human action as “a link between structural conditions and social outcomes.” This ignoring of the mediator between structure and results makes her analysis incomplete.\n\nAccording to David Laitin, Skocpol “finds history to be moved not by structure or agent but by irony.” One ironic point Skocpol makes is that, despite her emphasis on international pressures, France's revolution came at a time when France was “unequivocally victorious.” Outcomes that cannot be predicted by structure, Laitin says, “are explained by the demonic forces of irony.” Laitin also goes on to say that, although structure is important, Skocpol denies the importance of human choice and action. Irony, says Laitin, is not an element of structure, but Skocpol's attempt at avoiding admittance “that action and fortune play a pivotal role in the drama of history.” \n\nWalter Goldfrank believes “States and Social Revolutions” to be an excellent book. He argues that, while some might see her book to have limitations “in analyzing today’s core,” this does not “damage explanations of yesterday’s semi-periphery.\" Skocpol's major drawback, Goldfrank says, is her “tendency toward positivist ahistoricity.\"\n\nDespite this, Goldfrank says Skocpol's book marks a leap forward in historical scholarship. \nWhile the focus on Skocpol's book is international conflict and foreign wars, Rosemary O’Kane argues that the focus in understanding social revolutions should be civil wars instead. According to O’Kane, it is important to explore the decisions and policy implementations of the new state to see how they were affected by war, which Skocpol does not do. Skocpol, O’Kane says, “seems to stress the importance of international over national factors,” while still having civil war as an important factor in her argument. Skocpol's lack of focus on civil wars leads to the failure in her analysis. She fails to realize the “centralized control over the revolutionary forces of internal coercion.”\n\nAlthough published over thirty years ago, Theda Skocpol's book “States and Social Revolutions,” continues to influence historians and sociologists alike today. Skocpol presented a new way to look at social revolutions and analyze then through a structural and state centered perspective. Although her analysis may not be complete in the eyes of many, it offers a new perspective and fills in the holes in many theories before hers as well as the theories of her educators, including Barrington Moore Jr..\n\nIra Katznelson disputes that Skocpol's use of J.S. Mill's method of difference allows her to overcome the problems associated with many potential variables.\n\nPublisher the Cambridge University Press includes \"States and Social Revolutions\" in its \"Canto Classics\" series, which \"draws from the most successful titles published by Cambridge over the past half-century and more,\" and the book remains in print as of 2016.\n\nLewis A. Coser, president of the American Sociological Association, wrote in The New York Times Book Review, \"I am convinced that \"States and Social Revolutions\" will be considered a landmark in the study of the sources of revolution.\"\n\nIn Barbara Geddes's Paradigms and Sand Castles: Theory Building and Research Design in Comparative Politics, she writes that Skocpol's use of contrasting cases (cases where revolutions did happen and did not happen) makes her claims regarding the importance of class structures and alliances in determining revolution outcomes persuasive. But she writes that Skocpol's claim that all revolutionary outbreaks occur as a result of international crises is not well-supported. Geddes notes for example that a revolution occurred in France but France was not at the time more threatened by external events than many of its neighbors. Geddes also argues that Skocpol's choice of cases (and exclusion of other cases) is not particularly well-supported. When Geddes expanded the number of cases to include nine Latin-American countries, Skocpol's theory of social revolution failed replication. James Mahoney and Gary Goertz found no evidence that Geddes exclusively picked negative cases to intentionally lend support for her theory; they added additional relevant cases to her theory and found that her theory was consistent with those cases.\n\n"}
{"id": "1947051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1947051", "title": "Heidelberg United FC", "text": "Heidelberg United FC\n\nHeidelberg United Football Club (commonly referred to as Megas Alexandros, Alexander the Great, Warriors, or Bergers) is an football (soccer) club based in the northern Melbourne suburb of Heidelberg West, Victoria, Australia. The team currently competes in the National Premier League Victoria. \n\nThe Heidelberg United Alexander Soccer Club was founded in 1958 by Greek immigrants from Florina, Macedonia. They decided to form their own social club, the Clifton Hill Social Club. It was at that time when families, mainly immigrants wives and their unmarried children, began to arrive in Australia in great numbers.\n\nIn May 1955 the founding members, George Baniscas, Nicholas Themelkos, Nick Romanidis, Tryphon Rakovalis, Tryphon Avramopoulos, Chris Samartzis and Peter Economidis commenced their meetings at the residence of Tryphon Rakovalis in Fairfield. Their successful gathering attracted mostly Florinians, as well as from other regions. In 1957 discussions to establish \"Alexander The Great\" began.\n\nMarkos Economidis managed to convince the committee of Clifton Hill Social Club to contribute the funds required to purchase the necessary gear for the team. On 12 May 1958, the Clifton Hill members organised their first appeal. A total of 125 pounds was collected. Wishing to broaden support for the soccer team and in an effort to avoid any political affiliation and, thus, conflict, the leaders of \"Alexander The Great\" launched a campaign to run a completely independent sporting club. Their move gained momentum immediately.\n\nThe first committee consisting of George Baniscas (President), Markos Economidis (Secretary), NicholasThemelkos (Vice-President), Tryphon Rakovalis (Treasurer), A. Doukas, E. Mangopoulos, G. Milopoulos, V. Iliopoulos and T. Iliopoulos and Members. They declared Megas Alexandros its administrative independence from Clifton Hill Social Club.\n\nDuring the first two years (1958–1959) \"Alexander the Great\" received the financial support of the Clifton Hill Social Club, as well as of their own membership, the spectators and supporters, even the players. The records of the club indicate, for example, that on 1 February 1960 the players donated the amount of 5 pounds 3s 0d. The inaugural game was played on 13 September 1958 attracting four hundred spectators and 2 pounds 2s 10d was collected, an amount which\" was increased to 5 pounds 8s 3d within three months following the successful and popular start up of the club. The committee members walked around the fences to collect the entrance 'tickets' in a hat. Their wives were responsible for washing the playing gear and for having the first-aid box ready. The main expenditure areas included the hiring of the soccer grounds, administrative expenses, players' clothing, fees for the referee, usually 1 pound 10s 0d and drinks for the players.\n\nIn 1959 the first elections took place which returned the old committee with the addition of A. Nicolaides, L. Pavlides, E. Kreskas, P Boubis, S. Sakellarides, and S. Theos. The new committee increased the numbers of social activities in an effort to attract more family members to stabilise the affairs of the club and create a stronger team. The weekly social dances of the club were held at the Masonic Hall, Queens Parade, Clifton Hill. The members paid two shillings and sixpence as an entrance fee, which cleared an average of 40 pounds per week.\n\nFollowing the successful first two years, \"Alexander the Great\" applied unsuccessfully for a place in the Victorian Amateur Soccer Football Association (VASFA). The club's secretary, Markos Economides, in his letters dated 9 February and 17 March 1959 to the President of the VASF H.J. Dockerty, requested \"Alexander the Greats\" admission to the Victoria Provisional League. The club received a negative reply in a letter signed by VASFA's Secretary-Manager, S. Beaton, claiming that the club had not played a sufficient number of games to prove its strength, durability and financial stability. In September 1959, the committee, amidst renewed recruitment of players and membership, reapplied. This time Alexander the Great was admitted to the Provisional League, together with four other teams. By this time, the Club had managed to build a strong and skilful squad of twenty-one players, almost unbeatable in their category in Victoria. The 1958 and 1959 team included the players A. Balis, A. Boutlis, J. Dafinis, Th. Doukas, D. Filippou, V. Hatzigeorgiou, V. lordanis, K. Korfiatis, A. Politis, N. Romanides, C. Rakovalis, S. Savvides, A. Soumelides, P Themelkos, C. Zouros and C. Zygomanis. In 1960 Megas Alexandros was enriched and further strengthened with Th. Boutlis, L. Foutoulis, the brothers Evan and George Morihovitis, Th. Tangas, E. Taskas, K. Xanthopoulos and C. Zouros.\n\nDuring its inaugural appearance in the provisional league competition, \"Alexander the Great\" was declared the undisputed champions of the league, easily winning 34 points and scoring 113 goals. The official magazine of the VASFA, Soccer News, in its 24 September 1960 edition under the title 'Alexander are Real Champions' paid tribute to the club implicitly signalling, perhaps, remorse for the delayed admission: \"of the entrants, Alexander proved themselves champions when they easily won the League Championship with a total of 34 points. Their attack was the best of any team competing in Victorian soccer this season, with 113 goals scored.\"\n\nWith its successful appearance in competitive soccer, the club received an additional boost in the following years (1961–1963), winning all league competitions and climbing to the State League in 1964. In 1965 Alexander's activities declined due to internal administrative problems and the team was relegated. Next year (1966) the club again won the first division premiership and was promoted to State League only to drop back in 1969. In 1970it survived the transition and became a leading force when it won the 1975 Victorian State League (today's Victorian Premier League)Championship under its then name of Fitzroy United Alexander Soccer Club under coach Manolis Poulakakis.\n\nFitzroy United Alexander was a founding member of the National Soccer League and proved to be a model team for consistency, since it managed to score, throughout the years, the second best performance rate of all Australian teams competing in the highest league. At one stage (1982–1985) seven of the 16 national Socceroo players were players from the club.\n\nFollowing the formation of the National Soccer League in 1977, the club commenced negotiations with the Heidelberg City Council to move its grounds from Fitzroy to Heidelberg. The local council decided to lease the historic Olympic Village, (the training venue for the Melbourne 1956 Olympics) to Alexander. The terms and conditions of the lease were advantageous to the Club which was obtaining access to a prestigious soccer field, with a pavilion and track and field facilities. The committee, led by a solicitor and ex-player of the team, James Mangopoulos, began in November 1977 negotiating the possibility of leasing the grounds surrounding the pitch at the Olympic Village.\n\nIn 1978 the Mangopoulos Committee announced its plan to move to Heidelberg and advertised the erection of a covered grandstand seating 1,500 spectators, turnstiles and public facilities for 3,000 people, incurring a 'cost of $400,000 out of a total cost of the overall scheme of about $950,000. The contracts, however, were not finalised until 1982. The City of Heidelberg agreed to lease the land for thirty years, charging the Club a nominal amount. The club in the meantime obtained an official legal status by its registration with the Corporate Affairs Commission of Victoria in 1977.\n\nThe late 1970s and early 1980s the Club went through what many regard as its \"Golden Era\". In 1980, the Club won the \"Top 4\" play-off series beating Sydney City by 4 goals to nil in Canberra. Towards the end of the 1980s, the Club encountered difficulties both on and off the park. It was twice relegated (1987 and 1989) but managed to be promoted the next year back into the NSL. During this period for Heidelberg players such Juan Toro, Derek Lea and Charlie Yankos participated in this golden era.\n\nIn the 1990s it continued to play a prominent role in Australian soccer, operating with a yearly budget of more than $500,000. However, in 1995 the Club suffered a major setback when it was excluded from the National Soccer League along with Melbourne Zebras and the Parramatta Eagles. Soccer Australia, led by David Hill began the \"cleansing process\" of the league trying to remove all remnants of ethnicity by forcing Clubs to change their names. Alexander The Great made an attempt to rejoin the National League in a joint partnership arrangement with the Collingwood Football Club and whilst things looked promising at the start, pressure from the AFL saw the venture collapse by the end of its inaugural season. The team did however manage to win the National League Cup in 1996 emulating the feats of Heidelberg United who won the cup for the first time three years earlier in 1993.\n\nOn their return to the Victorian league in 1996, Heidelberg had a reasonably successful season, eventually losing in the Grand Final against Altona Magic in penalties after scores were locked at 3–3 after extra time. In 1998 they found themselves relegated, but won promotion back at their first attempt, rejoining the VPL in 2000, and winning the title in 2001. Their rollercoaster recent history however saw them relegated the next season, until they found themselves back in the VPL once more in 2005, and finishing runners up to Green Gully. A solid season in 2006 saw them reach the Preliminary Final, where they were knocked out by Altona Magic in extra time. An inconsistent season in 2007 saw the Bergers finish 8th and miss out on finals.\n\nCelebrating the 50-year anniversary of the club, 2008 transpired to be a successful season which included United winning the Hellenic Cup for the first time in its history. The season continued its positive direction seeing Heidelberg finish 4th in the Victorian Premier League after the Home and Away matches, and finishing the season in 3rd place following the finals series where they lost to the Melbourne Knights in the Preliminary final. 2010 was another strong season for the Warriors, finishing fourth in the league. They won their elimination final against Northcote City 3–1 but lost the minor semi final to Hume City 2–0.\n\nIn 2012, the club was relegated after a bottom place finish, but quickly returned to the top flight after taking out the State League 1 Championship in 2013.\n\nThe club's first season in the newly established National Premier Leagues Victoria, what was formerly the Victorian Premier League, saw them finish in 3rd place.\n\nIn the 2015 season, the Club qualified for the 2015 FFA Cup, through the Dockerty Cup. The Club progressed from the Round of 32 by beating Broadmeadow Magic FC 3–1 in Newcastle, then becoming one of the five Victorian clubs to progress through to the last eight, after defeating former NSL giants Sydney United 58 FC. Daniel Heffernan's goal after 26 seconds was the fastest ever goal scored in the FFA Cup. The club signed 116-time capped Greek international Kostas Katsouranis for their FFA Cup clash with Melbourne City FC. The Bergers went down 5–0 to their A-League opponents in the quarter final, but managed to draw a crowd of 11,372 at their home ground Olympic Village. The crowd was the second biggest crowd in FFA Cup history. The Warriors also made the reintroduced finals series of the 2015 National Premier Leagues Victoria season, after a third placed league finish, but lost to Pascoe Vale SC at the first hurdle.\n\nIn September 2015, the Bergers' star strikers Daniel Heffernan was signed by A-League club Central Coast Mariners. Heidelberg made a strange start to their 2016 campaign, opening the season with a record 6–0 defeat to South Melbourne FC at Lakeside Stadium, before bouncing back to defeat Melbourne Knights FC with an incredible scoreline of 6–1, scoring 4 goals in the opening 15 minutes. On 5 August 2016, Heidelberg confirmed the signing of Melbourne Victory icon Archie Thompson. Heidelberg finished the season in 2nd place, losing 2-1 to South Melbourne in the finals series semi-final.\n\nOn 1 August 2017, Heidelberg United defeated A-League side Perth Glory FC 1–0 at Olympic Village in the Round of 32 at the 2017 FFA Cup. Heidelberg took out the 2017 NPL Victoria premiership, but lost out to Bentleigh Greens in the Grand Final. Heidelberg became national champions of the NPL for the first time after defeating Bayswater City SC, APIA Leichhardt Tigers FC and Brisbane Strikers FC.\n\nOn 19 August 2018, Heidelberg secured back-to-back NPL Victoria Premierships with two rounds remaining after defeating South Melbourne at Olympic Village 4–2. The premiership was secured in the Bergers' 60th year of existence. Heidelberg went on to claim the championship, defeating Avondale FC 2–1 at AAMI Park. It was Heidelberg's first Premier League title since 2001.\n\nIn June 2019, Heidelberg began demolition of their home ground Olympic Village in preparation of a staged refurbishment of the precinct. The total cost of the project is $11m. To date, the club has secured $2m in state government funding, $3.1m from the City of Banyule and $0.5m from Soltilo Soccer School. On the last round of the 2019 NPL Victoria season, the Bergers secured a third consecutive Premiers Plate with a 3–0 victory over South Melbourne.\nHeidelberg's home ground is Olympic Village in Heidelberg West.\n\nOlympic Park (Village) was built for the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne, Australia. The venue was used as the official warm-up venue for the Olympics.\n\nThe ground has a main grandstand with seating for 1,000 as well as undercover standing room. Opposite the main stadium is smaller grandstand with more undercover standing room. Both stands have grass hills on either side but there is no spectator room behind each of the goals. One end contains player facilities while the other has a fence with advertising and the scoreboard. The original athletics track is still intact but is in poor condition. The total capacity of the ground is 12,000.\n\nThe stadium has been Heidelberg's home for most of their history and has seen many large crowds against rivals such as South Melbourne FC and Melbourne Knights FC. \nA crowd of 11,372 people turned up to watch the 2015 FFA Cup quarter final match between Heidelberg United and Melbourne City. This was the second highest crowd in FFA Cup history.\n\nChampions - 1975, 1988, 1990, 2001, 2018\n\nRunners Up - 1996, 2005\n\nMinor Premiers - 1975, 2017, 2018, 2019\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known as the creator of the ACT and other standardized tests. His contributions to the field of educational testing are significant and still evident today.\n\nHe was also an early popularizer, and perhaps originator, of the inconsistent hybrid form of statistical hypothesis testing (mixing the incompatible approaches of Ronald Fisher and of Neyman–Pearson), in his textbook \"Statistical Analysis In Educational Research\" (1940). This approach, despite its fundamental flaws, has been extremely influential, and is now widespread in statistical applications and science.\n\nEverett Franklin Lindquist was a native of Gowrie, Iowa. He was the son of Jonas A. Lindquist and Hannah O. Anderson.\n\nLindquist joined the University of Iowa in 1925 as a research assistant. He received his Ph.D. in 1927 and was a member of the Iowa faculty until retirement in 1969.\nIn 1953 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.\n\nDesiring to create an academic competition for Iowa students, he developed a set of tests in 1929. These evolved into the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, an exam for elementary and middle school students, as well as the Iowa Tests of Educational Development for high schoolers. Despite their name, they are used nationwide, especially since the enactment of No Child Left Behind legislation. Due to their success, he founded the not-for-profit Measurement Research Center on the Iowa campus to score these tests, which was later acquired by Westinghouse, NCS, and its present owner, Pearson PLC.\n\nIn 1959, he introduced the ACT, an examination to test students on practical knowledge rather than cognitive reasoning examined on the SAT. The ACT is still in widespread use today, and is headquartered in Lindquist's hometown, Iowa City, Iowa. Although it is now administered by the College Board, the competing organization to ACT, Lindquist developed the first National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Tests.\n\nLindquist was on the committee that developed the GED, which evolved during World War II as a way to grant academic credit to servicemen.\n\nAs a result of the fast-growing use of ITBS tests, he developed the first practical optical mark recognition system as a replacement for the electrical mark sense IBM 805 Test Scoring Machine. Although many of his colleagues at the University of Iowa contributed to the invention, Lindquist is generally credited with this development and is the sole inventor listed on U.S. Patent 3,050,248 (Filed 1955, granted 1962).\n\nLindquist's first optical mark recognition scanner used a mimeograph paper-transport mechanism directly coupled to a magnetic drum memory. Although it was not a general purpose computer, it made extensive use of computer technology.\n\nHis 1940 book, \"Statistical Analysis in Educational Research\", laid the groundwork for the need to interpret testing data in smaller settings using accessible means. He was the editor of the first edition of the then definitive work, \"Educational Measurement\" (1951) and contributed his own chapter outlining the problems and issues facing his field. These issues are still of great importance today. A second influential book, \"Design and Analysis of Experiments in Psychology and Education\" (1953), expounded on the ideas mentioned in his first book, cementing his authority as an expert on educational research.\n\nThe Lindquist Center, home to the University of Iowa College of Education, is currently on the University of Iowa campus and was named in his honor. Additionally, the Lindquist Building on the ACT campus in Iowa City also exists in his honor. He was also named one of Iowa City's \"Fabulous 150\" by the \"Iowa City Press Citizen\".\n\nAlthough many classes now teach to his tests and ACT preparation is a multimillion-dollar industry, Lindquist discouraged teaching to the test – due to this problem, his competitions ended in the late 1930s.\n"}

In it, God (the Hebrew word used for God, like in all of Genesis 1, is Elohim) made light by declaration (\"God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light\"). It is a part of the Torah portion known as Bereshit (Genesis 1:1-6:8).\n\n\"Let there be light\" (like \"in the beginning\" in ) has entered into common usage as a phrase. It is the motto (sometimes in its Latin form, \"fiat lux\") for many educational institutions (using light as a metaphor for knowledge). The University of California is one example. The phrase also forms the chorus of John Marriott's hymn about Creation, \"Thou, Whose Almighty Word.\"\n\nAugustine of Hippo, in his \"City of God\", sees the verse as indicating \"not only that God had made the world, but also that He had made it by the word.\" The words \"let there be light\" are the first divine words in the Bible. The Latin for \"let there be light\" is \"\"fiat lux\",\" and this description of creation by command has led to the theological phrase \"creation by fiat.\" In the words of Peter Kreeft, God \"simply spoke... and it came to be.\"\n\nGerhard von Rad considers the implication to be \"the most radical distinction between Creator and creature. Creation cannot be even remotely considered an emanation from God; it is not somehow an overflow or reflection of his being, i.e., of his divine nature, but is rather a product of his personal will.\"\n\nThe divine \"\"fiat lux\"\" in this passage has \"exerted a powerful influence on the English poetic tradition.\" The many examples include John Dryden's lines \"Thus Britain's Basis on a Word is laid, / As by a word the World itself was made.\"\n\nSt Basil emphasises the role of light in making the universe beautiful, as does St Ambrose, who writes: \"But the good Author uttered the word 'light' so that He might reveal the world by infusing brightness therein and thus make its aspect beautiful.\"\n\nThe light is described as being created here before the sun, moon, and stars, which appear on the fourth day (). In some Jewish interpretations, the light created here is a primordial light, different in nature from (and brighter than) that associated with the sun. The light has also been interpreted metaphorically, and has been connected to Psalm 104 (a \"poem of creation\"), where God is described as wrapping himself in light.\n\nSome writers have seen a connection between this verse and the Big Bang in physical cosmology.\n\nVarious translations into English of the Hebrew text (\"Wayyōmer Ělōhîm \"yǝhî ôr,\" wayǝhî ôr\") include:\n\n"}

The term is particularly used in political science and sociology to describe the fact that developments in one place will often act as a catalyst in another place.\n\nParents may take care of their parents to create a demonstration effect by which their children later care for them.\n\nCountries and local governments may adopt laws and economic policies similar to those that appear to demonstrate success elsewhere. The proven success of the policies provides a demonstration effect that leads other governments to attempt to emulate that success.\n\nThe demonstration effect has been observed as a natural consequence of tourism. One study argues that the demonstration effect can be broken down into four forms: exact imitation, deliberately inexact imitation, accidental inexact imitation, and social learning.\n\nIn economics, demonstration effects may help explain the spread of financial or economic crises like the Asian financial crisis. Investors do not know everything about the economic situation of countries where they invest. When investors see a country's economy collapse, however, they may question the safety of investments in other countries with similar economic policies.\n\nSome heterodox economists such as James Duesenberry and Robert H. Frank, following the original insights of Thorstein Veblen (1899), have argued that awareness of the consumption habits of others tends to inspire emulation of these practices. Duesenberry (1949) gave the name \"demonstration effect\" to this phenomenon, arguing that it promoted unhappiness with current levels of consumption, which impacted savings rates and consequently opportunities for macroeconomic growth. Similarly, Ragnar Nurkse (1953) argued that the exposure of a society to new goods or ways of living creates unhappiness with what had previously been acceptable consumption practices; he dubbed it the \"international demonstration effect.\" He claimed that in developing nations, pressure to increase access to material goods rapidly increases, primarily because people \"come into contact with superior goods or superior patterns of consumption, with new articles or new ways of meeting old wants.\" As a result, he argued, these people are \"apt to feel after a while a certain restlessness and dissatisfaction. Their knowledge is extended, their imagination stimulated; new desires are aroused\".\n\nIn the late 18th century, the successful American Revolution may have provided a demonstration effect that sparked the subsequent French Revolution. Political movements may be given a boost from the observed success of similar movements in other countries. The domino effect thesis relates to this idea; it argued that communist revolutions in some countries would spread to other countries.\n\n"}

He especially well known for his views about the influence of judicial decisions on Canadian public policy. In 2010, Knopff was appointed by the then Prime Minister Stephen Harper to the Governor General Consultation Committee, a special committee to recommend a successor to Governor General of Canada Michaëlle Jean. The panel recommended David Johnston who was installed as viceroy on October 1, 2010.\n\nRainer Knopff is often described as a member of the Calgary School, which includes a group of conservatively inclined professors at the University of Calgary, such as Barry Cooper, F.L.(Ted) Morton, Tom Flanagan (political scientist) and history professor David Bercuson who are strongly committed to strategic and direct influence on public affairs with a long term vision. \n\nBy 1998, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a public policy research institution based in Washington, DC had already observed the ascendancy of the role of Calgary-based academics on Canadian public policy, specifically the Calgary School of political science (Rovinsky 1998:10).\n\nThe Calgary School are clever strategists who chose to write about contentious, controversial and current topics that \"people care about\" by simplifying and polarizing complex and sensitive issues giving them dramatic interest and mass appeal. Their role is not to clarify public policy alternatives available to help political leaders make informed choices.\n\nRainer Knopff writes on constitutional and judicial politics (Knopff 2008:44) and since 1982, has been particularly active in challenging the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms often co-authoring with F. L. Morton.\n\nIn their book entitled \"The Charter Revolution & the Court Party\" Morton and Knopff (2000) argue that \"the advent of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms has drastically increased the power of judges in Canadian society. In deciding to use their new powers in an activist way, judges have been urged on by what Morton and Knopff call \"the Court Party,\" a loose coalition of feminists, civil libertarians, government lawyers, Supreme Court clerks, law professors, and social activists, many funded principally by government (Morton and Knopff 2000:55).\".\n\nKnopff entered into a highly controversial debate in defense of a Calgary School colleague whose career ended abruptly when his comments on the consumption of child pornography were publicized. In a statement from Elizabeth Cannon, President of the University of Calgary, regarding remarks made by Tom Flanagan, the University sought to distance themselves from Flanagan's comments declaring that they \"absolutely do not represent the views of the University of Calgary. In the university's view, child pornography is not a victimless crime. All aspects of this horrific crime involve the exploitation of children. Viewing pictures serves to create more demand for these terrible images, which leads to further exploitation of defenseless children (Cannon 2013).\"\n\nIn his criticism of the university, the CBC, the Manning Institute, Knopff cited the \"famous Sharpe case\" in which \"both the trial judge and the B.C. Court of Appeal struck down Canada's criminal prohibition of possessing child pornography\" in what was called a \"courageous\" act in the face of a \"hallmark of tyranny.\" While Rainer agreed with the possession offence, he agreed with his colleague's statement that the demand-side consumption of child pornography is one of personal liberty and suggests that as opposed to the production side, which is a more harmful crime, could be addressed through treatment, not incarceration.\n"}

{"id": "1947080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1947080", "title": "Tairona", "text": "Tairona\n\nTairona (or Tayrona) was a Pre-Columbian culture of Colombia, which consisted in a group of chiefdoms in the region of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in present-day Cesar, Magdalena and La Guajira Departments of Colombia, South America, which goes back at least to the 1st century AD and had significant demographic growth around the 11th century.\n\nThe Tairona people formed one of the two principal linguistic groups of the Chibchan family, the other being the Muisca. Genetic and archaeological evidence shows a relatively dense occupation of the region by at least 200 BC. Pollen data compiled by Luisa Fernanda Herrera in 1980 shows considerable deforestation and the use of cultigens such as yuca and maize since possibly 1200 BC. However, occupation of the Colombian Caribbean coast by sedentary or semi-sedentary populations has been documented to have occurred by c. 4000 BC. \n\nEthnohistorical data shows that initial contact with the Spanish was tolerated by the Tairona; but by 1600 AD confrontations grew, and a small part of the Tairona population moved to the higher stretches of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. This movement allowed them to evade the worst of the Spanish colonial system during the 17th and 18th centuries. The indigenous Kogi, Wiwa, Arhuacos (Ijka, Ifca) and Kankuamo people who live in the area today are believed to be direct descendants of the Tairona.\n\nEtymological similarities of the word Tairona survive in the four main linguistic groups of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta: in Sanca Language it is pronounced \"Teiruna\", in Kankuamo language \"Teijua\" or \"Tairuna\" and in Ijka \"Teruna\", meaning \"Males\" or \"sons of the Jaguar.\"\n\nAlthough \"Tairona\" may be an inaccurate name for the people who inhabited the region during the contact with the Spanish Empire, it has become the most common name for a hierarchical network of villages that developed around 900. Initially it was used to refer to the inhabitants of a valley and probably a chiefdom named Tairo on the northern slope of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. But by the 16th century, the Spanish used it for the whole group of complex chiefdoms in the area. The groups in the northern and western Sierra Nevada were largely indistinguishable to the Spaniards, and became indistinguishable to archaeologists in more modern times.\n\nThe archaeological sequence of the region spans from approximately 200 BC to the 17th century , when the Tairona were forcibly integrated into the Spanish Encomienda system. The available Carbon-14 dates show that the coastal sites were occupied from perhaps as early as 200 BC, much earlier than those at higher elevations, including some of the largest centers, at above sea level. The coves and inlets on the Caribbean coast, like Chengue, Neguanje, Gayraca, Cinto and Buritaca, where villages have only more modest architecture, show the longest occupations, spanning the whole 1,800 years. \nKnowledge sources about the pre-Columbian Tairona civilization are limited to archaeological findings and a few written references from the Spanish colonial era. One of the first descriptions of the region was written by Pedro Martyr d' Anghiera and was published in 1530. The area also was described by other explorers who visited the region between 1505 and 1524. Anghiera portrays the Tairona valleys as densely populated, with extensive fields irrigated in the same way as those in Tuscany. Many villages were dedicated to fishing and traded their marine goods for the rest of their needs with those living inland. Anghiera describes how they aggressively repelled the Spanish when they attempted to take women and children as slaves in the first contacts. It appears that as a result, the first contacts with the Tairona were very violent and the Spanish suffered great losses, which resulted in a more diplomatic strategy from the first governor of Santa Marta, Rodrigo de Bastidas.\n\nOne of the best-known Tairona nucleated villages and archaeological sites is known as Ciudad Perdida (Spanish for \"Lost City\"). It was a major city, about 13 hectares (32 acres) in the \"core\". It was discovered by looters in 1975 but is now under the care of the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History. Recent studies suggest that it was inhabited by approximately 1,600 to 2,400 people that lived in at least 11,700 square meters (124,000 square feet) of roofed space, in about 184 round houses built on top of terraces paved with stone. There are many other sites of similar or greater size.\n\nA larger site, Pueblito, is located near the coast. According to Reichel-Dolmatoff's research, it contains at least 254 terraces and had a population of about 3,000 people. Archaeological studies in the area show that even larger nucleated villages existed towards the western slope of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, like Posiguieca and Ciudad Antigua.\n\nSmaller villages and hamlets were part of a very robust exchange network of specialized communities, connected with stone-paved paths. Villages that specialized in salt production and fishing, like Chengue in the Parque Tairona, are evidence of a robust Tairona political economy based on specialized staple production. Chengue contains at least 100 terraces and was inhabited by about 800 to 1,000 people in 15 hectares by 1400. The Tairona are known to have built stone terraced platforms, house foundations, stairs, sewers, tombs, and bridges. Use of pottery for utilitarian and ornamental or ceremonial purposes was also highly developed as a result of fairly specialized communities.\n\nThe Tairona ceramic chronologies range from 200 BCE to 1650 CE, and the Caribbean coast of Colombia has evidence of ceramics from at least 2500 BCE. Recent investigations in Chengue, Parque Tairona by the Colombian archaeologist Alejandro Dever show significant variations in the ceramic that allow for a chronological division of sequence into at least five phases. The first phase, called Nahuange 1, appears to start at around 200 BCE and ends at around 500 CE when there appears to be a peak in the population. A second phase spans from 500 AD to about 900 AD; it can be called Nehuange 2, and was called Buritaca after detailed excavations by Jack Wynn in the 1970s. From c. 900 CE began what is commonly called the Tairona period, characterized by an impressive increase in the variation, size and number of ceramic forms, many conserving the styles from the Nehuange or Buritaca phases. The Tairona 1 through 3 phases, from 900 to 1650, show significant local variations. This was shown by numerous works done in the 1980s by Colombian archaeologists Augusto Oyuela, Carl Langebaek, Luisa Fernanda Herrera and Ana Maria Groot, and others. During the Tairona period, the evidence for exchange increases as does the population of the entire region. The causes for this population increase are not fully known but what is evident is the robust local exchange networks that emerge at this time.\nThe Tairona civilization is most renowned for its distinctive goldwork. The earliest known Tairona gold work has been described for the Neguanje Period (from about 300 to 800 AD). Its use in the Tairona society appears to have extended beyond the elite, although little proof of this exists. The gold artifacts consist of pendants, lip-plugs, nose ornaments, necklaces, and earrings. The Tairona cast a meltable mixture of gold, silver and copper called Tumbaga into intricate moulds using clay, sand, charcoal and lost wax. Depletion gilding, using controlled corrosion to remove copper from the surface, gave the appearance of solid gold. Cast Tairona figure pendants (known as \"caciques\") in particular stand out among the goldworks of pre-Columbian America because of their richness in detail. The figurines depict human subjects - probably the shamanic elite that ruled them - in ornate dresses and with a large animal mask over the face. Many elements of their body posture (e.g., hands on their hips) and dress signal an aggressive stance, and hence are interpreted by some as evidence for the power of the wearer and the bellicose nature of Tairona society at that time. Not only that, but recent revelations have shown that this was the first step of a process known as 'transformation', which involved members of the shaman elite putting on sub-labial ornaments, nose rings etc. to resemble certain bat species and extract powers from the animal, opening their eyes to a greater truth.\n\nAt the time of the conquest, the Tairona had different traditional cultural practices than modern Native American populations. Ethnographic sources highlight freedom to divorce and acceptance of homosexuality, which differed significantly from their Catholic conquerors. The Tairona religion, and to some extent modern Kogui religion, separate much of the domestic life between genders. Modern scholars have determined that the descriptions of Tairona homosexuality were an attempt by the Catholic establishment to abolish the Tairona male meeting house, which was the site of intense and permanent religious activity. These rituals are believed to be very similar to those of the Kogui, modern descendants of some of the Tairona chiefdoms. Many of the adult men are involved in rituals, sometimes lasting days, and consisting mostly of coca chewing and meditation.\n\nIn 1599, the Tairona revolted against the Spanish, apparently because economic and religious pressure from the Spanish had become intolerable. The main aggression was the killing of priests and travellers along the roads connecting the Spanish city of Santa Marta and the Tairona centers of Bonda and the villages of Concha and Chengue. Secondary targets were the churches and houses of known bureaucrats of the colonial administration. However, these data are from Spanish testimonies from the trial against the Tairona chiefs in 1602. The Chiefs of Chengue and Bonda were sentenced to death, their bodies dismembered, their villages burned, and much of the population was relocated and incorporated into the Encomienda system. By the mid-17th century, many Tairona populations were completely abandoned and the region was engulfed by forest.\n\nTheir descendants today are the Kogi, Arhuaco, Wiwa, and Kankuamo people.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1947113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1947113", "title": "Pro set", "text": "Pro set\n\nIn American football, the pro set or split backs formation is a formation that was commonly used as a \"base\" set by professional and amateur teams. The \"pro set\" formation featured an offensive backfield that deployed two running backs aligned side-by-side instead of one in front of the other as in traditional I-formation sets. It was an outgrowth of the three running back T-formation, with the third running back (one of the halfbacks) in the T becoming a permanent flanker, now referred to as a wide receiver.\n\nThis formation was particularly popular because teams can both run and pass the football out of it with an equal amount of success. This is important because it keeps defenses guessing on what type of play the offense will run. Because the backs are opposite each other, it takes the defense longer to read the gap the offense will run the ball to. \nOnce the run has been established, it can be a very dangerous formation. Because of the real threat of a team running out of the pro-set, defenses must respect the play fake and play run. This pulls the safety to the line and opens up the middle of the field deep. Also, with both backs in position to \"pick up\" an outside blitz, the pro-set gives a quarterback an abundance of time to find an open receiver.\n\nThe set can be run with a single tight end and two receivers or no tight ends and three receivers.\n\nA standard pro set places the backs about 5 yards behind the line of scrimmage, spaced evenly behind the guards or tackles. In this look teams may utilize two halfbacks, or one halfback and one fullback.\n\nA variation of the pro set places the backs offset toward one side (either strong or weak). This look is almost universally used with one fullback one halfback. The backs line up closer to the line of scrimmage than in a standard pro set, about 3 yards deep. The fullback lines up directly behind the quarterback, in the spot he would normally line up in the I-Formation. The halfback then lines up behind either the left or right tackle.\n\nThe formation has lost its popularity at the college and professional level recently with the rise of shotgun split back formations. It remains common at the high school Junior Varsity and Varsity level.\n\nAt the NFL level, in the mid-to-late 2000s, the formation became used almost exclusively by West Coast Offense-based teams in occasional third down passing situations, and goal-line situations. In the early 2010s, the pro set almost completely disappeared from the NFL, however in the late 2010s it has been used once again as an occasional goal line and passing downs formation by West Coast Offense-based teams.\n"}
{"id": "1947121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1947121", "title": "SS Georgette", "text": "SS Georgette\n\nSS Georgette was a steamship built in 1872. She is best known, especially in Irish-American circles, for the part played in the story of the Catalpa rescue in April 1876. While the events surrounding her shipwrecking eight months later are dramatic and did capture the imagination of the local press, the ship itself had little effect on the coastal trade. Though heralding the way forward in the change from sail to steam on the long Western Australian coast, like its predecessor SS \"Xantho\",  \"Georgette\" had a short and ill-starred career and sank soon after its arrival there.\n\n\"SS Georgette\" was built in 1872 at Dumbarton. She was a 211-ton iron screw-steamer, 46.2 metres long, 6.9 metres wide and 3.4 metres deep. Intended as a collier, she had a capacity of 460 tons deadweight, and her two engines produced 48 horsepower. She also carried two masts with a schooner rig.\n\nWhile still nearly new, \"Georgette\" was sold in England to Western Australian buyers for £14,000. She arrived at Fremantle, Western Australia in September 1873, and was put to work as a coastal trading and passenger service between Fremantle, Albany and Champion Bay. In October 1873, she was stranded on the Murray Reef, and had to be sent to Adelaide for an overhaul. She resumed service in March 1874.\n\nIn April 1876, the American whaling barque \"Catalpa\" rescued a group of Fenian political prisoners from Fremantle. \"Catalpa\" had dropped anchor in international waters, and despatched a whaleboat to shore to collect the escapees. The escape was detected while the escapees were still rowing back to \"Catalpa\", and the \"Georgette\", which was in Fremantle at the time, was sent with a water police cutter to intercept them. However the prisoners successfully reached \"Catalpa\" and, having no official orders to board \"Catalpa\", \"Georgette\" and the police cutter withdrew. The following morning, \"Georgette\" returned and demanded the return of the prisoners. \"Catalpa\"'s captain, George Anthony, denied that he had the prisoners on board, and pointed out that he was in international waters. \"Georgette\" then fired a warning shot with its 12 pounder (5 kg) cannon, but Anthony pointed at his ship's US flag and sailed away. \"Georgette\" pursued until it was low on fuel, then returned to Fremantle.\n\nOn 29 November 1876, \"SS Georgette\" left Fremantle on what would be her last voyage. She was carrying fifty passengers and a cargo of jarrah, and was bound for Adelaide via Bunbury, Busselton and Albany. Shortly after midnight on 1 December, when \"Georgette\" was about midway between Cape Naturaliste and Cape Hamelin, a leak developed, and the ship's pumps would not work. By 4 a.m., the water was rising so fast that her Captain, John Godfrey, had all the passengers and crew bailing with buckets while he steered for the coast. At 6 p.m. the rising water extinguished the engine's fires, leaving \"Georgette\" drifting still some kilometres from shore. Godfrey then gave the orders to man the lifeboats, but the first lifeboat to be lowered was thrown against the ship's side by a big wave, and snapped in half. Some of the occupants were rescued by a second lifeboat, but twelve lives were lost.\n\n\"Georgette\" continued to drift until she drifted into the surf at Calgardup Bay, where she was seen by the Bussell family's Aboriginal stockman, Sam Isaacs. Isaacs ran to the Bussell homestead to raise the alarm, where he found only Ellen Bussell and her 16-year-old daughter Grace. Grace Bussell and Isaacs then returned to the scene on horseback. Meanwhile, \"Georgette\" had grounded and begun to break up. On arriving at the scene, Grace Bussell immediately rode down the cliffs and into the surf, swimming her horse out until it was alongside one of the swamped lifeboats. With as many people as possible clinging to her and her horse, she returned to shore and landed them. One man was left on the boat, and Isaacs was sent to collect him. Godfrey continued to launch lifeboats, but every one was swamped or capsized in the surf. Bussell and Isaacs continued their rescuing efforts, taking over four hours to land all the passengers.\n\nGrace Bussell's role in the rescue was widely and enthusiastically reported, with newspapers around the world picking up the story. Bussell was touted as \"Western Australia's Grace Darling\", and was awarded the Royal Humane Society's silver medal. Isaacs received a bronze. Godfrey, on the other hand, received much of the blame for the shipwreck. He was found not guilty on five counts of negligence, but his captain's certificate was still revoked. Godfrey managed to somehow regain his certificate in the two years following the sinking and became captain of the brig \"Laughing Wave.\" He committed suicide before daylight on 3 May 1882, by jumping overboard when the brig was off the North-west Cape.\n\n\"Georgette\"'s hull was sold for £40. Today the wreck lies in five metres of water, about 90 metres off Redgate Beach. The site is protected under the \"Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976\".\n\nFuture Western Australian premier George Leake was one of the survivors of the sinking.\n\n"}
