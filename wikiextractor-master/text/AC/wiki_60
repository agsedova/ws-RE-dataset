It's the third game in \"\" series. A remake, titled was created for the Famicom Disk System in 1987 by Jaleco.\n\nOn the run from the authorities after his in the Miners' strike, Monty the mole must escape from his house and head for the English Channel and freedom in Europe. In traditional platform game fashion, along the way he needs to collect various objects and solve puzzles to complete his escape. Before the game, five objects must be chosen to form Monty's Freedom Kit. Choosing the wrong items will leave the player unable to pass certain screens. This also acted as an anti-piracy measure, since the objects were only given numbers onscreen meaning the player had to refer to the accompanying manual. The final screen sees Monty boarding a ferry to France. This was then the starting point for the follow-up \"Auf Wiedersehen Monty\".\n\nThe game has a sense of British surrealness similar to \"Manic Miner\" and \"Jet Set Willy\" - in gameplay it is more similar to the latter. Enemies patrol every screen, water is deadly to the touch and Monty runs the risk of being squashed by the many pistons.\n\nThe Commodore 64 version was produced by Micro Projects Ltd, joint owned by Anthony Clarke and Jason Perkins, with graphical input by Mark Rodgers and music by Rob Hubbard. The music for the Commodore 64 version is regarded as one of the best computer game scores for that platform. The main game theme was, according to Hubbard, inspired by \"Devil's Galop\", the theme tune to the radio serial Dick Barton. It was rated #1 on Skytopia's list of The All-Time Top C64 Game Tunes and was also rated #2 in Hardcore Gaming 101's Top 100 Western Video Game Music of all time.\n\nFamicom Disk System remake of the game bears very little resemblance to the original version. For instance, Monty Mole has been replaced with a human on the run from prison and now has to escape through various Aztec-like temples.\nThe only real association the game does have with the original is Gremlin's copyright and the familiar \"in-game\" theme playing on the title screen. Like many Famicom Disk System titles, \"Monty's Great Heart-pounding Escape\" is little known outside Japan as the game was never ported to cartridge for a Western NES release.\n\nIn 2019, the game was unofficially ported to Atari 8-bit family.\n\nThe game was reviewed in 1990 in \"Dragon\" #158 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column, as part of the Mastertronic MEGA Pack of 10 games previously released in Europe. The reviewers normally gave a game a rating from 1 to 5 stars, but they gave this game an \"X\" for \"Not recommended\", stating \"It crashed every time we tried to play it\". The Commodore 64 version was positively received by the reviewers of Zzap!64; it was given a 90% overall rating. The game was a bestseller in the UK Spectrum charts. Crash magazine gave the Spectrum version 94/100.\n\n"}

{"id": "2128410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2128410", "title": "Delamination", "text": "Delamination\n\nDelamination is a mode of failure where a material fractures into layers. A variety of materials including laminate composites and concrete can fail by delamination. Processing can create layers in materials such as steel formed by rolling and plastics and metals from 3D printing which can fail from layer separation. Also, surface coatings such as paints and films can delaminate from the coated substrate.\n\nIn laminated composites, the adhesion between layers often fails first causing the layers to separate. For example, in fiber-reinforced plastics, sheets of high strength reinforcement (e.g., carbon fiber, fiberglass) are bound together by a much weaker polymer matrix (e.g., epoxy). In particular, loads applied perpendicular to the high strength layers, and shear loads can cause the polymer matrix to fracture or the fiber reinforcement to debond from the polymer.\n\nDelamination also occurs in reinforced concrete when metal reinforcements (i.e., rebar) near the surface corrode. The oxidized metal has a larger volume causing stresses when confined by the concrete. When the stresses exceed the strength of the concrete cracks can form and spread to join with neighboring cracks caused by corroded rebar creating a fracture plane that runs parallel to the surface. Once the fracture plane has developed, the concrete at the surface can separate from the substrate.\n\nProcessing can create layers in materials which can fail by delamination. In concrete, surfaces can flake off from improper finishing. If the surface is finished and densified by troweling while the underlying concrete is bleeding water and air, the dense top layer may separate from the water and air pushing upwards. In steels, rolling can create a microstructure when the microscopic grains are oriented in flat sheets which can fracture into layers. Also, certain 3D printing methods (e.g., Fused Deposition) builds parts in layers that can delaminate during printing or use. When printing thermoplastics with fused deposition, cooling a hot layer of plastic applied to a cold substrate layer can cause bending due to differential thermal contraction and layer separation.\n\nThere are multiple nondestructive testing methods to detect delamination in structures including visual inspection, tap testing (i.e. sounding), ultrasound, radiography, and infrared imaging.\n\nVisual inspection is useful for detecting delaminations at the surface and edges of materials. However, a visual inspection may not detect delamination within a material without cutting the material open.\n\nTap testing or sounding involves gently striking the material with a hammer or hard object to find delamination based on the resulting sound. In laminated composites, a clear ringing sound indicates a well bonded material whereas a duller sound indicates the presence of delamination due to the defect dampening the impact. Tap testing is well suited for finding large defects in flat panel composites with a honeycomb core whereas thin laminates may have small defects that are not discernible by sound. Using sound is also subjective and dependent on the inspector's quality of hearing as well as judgement. Any intentional variations in the part may also change the pitch of the produced sound, influencing the inspection. Some of these variations include ply overlaps, ply count change gores, core density change (if used), and geometry.\n\nIn reinforced concretes intact regions will sound solid whereas delaminated areas will sound hollow. Tap testing large concrete structures is carried about either with a hammer or with a chain dragging device for horizontal surfaces like bridge decks. Bridge decks in cold climate countries which use de-icing salts and chemicals are commonly subject to delamination and as such are typically scheduled for annual inspection by chain-dragging as well as subsequent patch repairs of the surface.\n\nASTM provides standards for paint adhesion testing which provides qualitative measures for paints and coatings resistance to delamination from substrates. Tests include cross-cut test, scrape adhesion, and pull-off test.\n\nFracture toughness is a material property that describes resistance to fracture and delamination. It is denoted by critical stress intensity factor formula_1 or critical strain energy release rate formula_2. For unidirectional fiber reinforced polymer laminate composites, ASTM provides standards for determining mode I fracture toughness formula_3 and mode II fracture toughness formula_4 of the interlaminar matrix. During the tests load formula_5 and displacement formula_6 is recorded for analysis to determine the strain energy release rate from the compliance method. formula_7 in terms of compliance is given by\n\nwhere formula_8 is the change in compliance formula_9 (ratio of formula_10), formula_11 is the thickness of the specimen, and formula_12 is the change in crack length.\n\nASTM D5528 specifies the use of the double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen geometry for determining mode I interlaminar fracture toughness. A double cantilever beam specimen is created by placing a non-stick film between reinforcement layers in the center of the beam before curing the polymer matrix to create an initial crack of length formula_13. During the test the specimen is loaded in tension from the end of the initial crack side of the beam opening the crack. Using the compliance method, the critical strain energy release rate is given by\n\nwhere formula_14 and formula_15 are the maximum load and displacement respectively by determining when the load deflection curve has become nonlinear with a line drawn from the origin with a 5% increase in compliance. Typically, equation 2 overestimates the fracture toughness because the two cantilever beams of the DCB specimen will have a finite rotation at the crack. The finite rotation can be corrected for by calculating formula_7 with a slightly longer crack with length formula_17 giving\n\nThe crack length correction formula_18 can be calculated experimentally by plotting the least squares fit of the cube root of the compliance formula_19 vs. crack length formula_20. The correction formula_18 is the absolute value of the x intercept. Fracture toughness can also be corrected with the compliance calibration method where formula_3 given by\n\nwhere formula_23 is the slope of the least squares fit of formula_24 vs. formula_25.\n\nMode II interlaminar fracture toughness can be determined by an edge notch flexure test specified by ASTM D7905. The specimen is prepared in a similar manner as the DCB specimen introducing an initial crack with length formula_13 before curing the polymer matrix. If the test is performed with the initial crack (non-precracked method) the candidate fracture toughness formula_27 is given by\n\nformula_28\n\nwhere formula_11 is the thickness of the specimen and formula_30 is the max load and formula_31is a fitting parameter. formula_31 is determined by experimental results with a least squares fit of compliance formula_9 vs. the crack length cubed formula_34 with the form of\n\nformula_35.\n\nThe candidate fracture toughness formula_36 equals the mode II fracture toughness formula_4 if strain energy release rate falls within certain percentage of formula_36 at different crack lengths specified by ASTM.\n"}

Currently the term refers to naval vessels that can perform similar duties. The SCS was intended as an escort vessel, providing air support for convoys. It was canceled after budgetary cuts to the US Navy.\n\nThe SCS was to be equipped with a mix of Rockwell XFV-12 fighter aircraft and anti-submarine warfare helicopters. It was tasked with carrying out anti-submarine warfare operations.\n\nIn the late 1960s, studies by US Navy identified a potential requirement for large scale convoy operations in the event of a war with the Soviet Union. In order to compensate for a shortage of escort ships, it was suggested that helicopters operating from small helicopter carriers could fill the gap. When Elmo Zumwalt became Chief of Naval Operations in 1970, he seized on the idea of small helicopter carriers as part of his \"High-Low\" plan in which large numbers of cheaper lower capability ships would be built to supplement existing expensive high capability ships. The proposed small carrier, which was named the Sea Control Ship (SCS), was required to provide continuous airborne cover of two anti-submarine and one airborne early warning helicopters, as well as carrying VSTOL fighters to stop Soviet long-range aircraft (like the Tupolev Tu-95 \"Bear\") from shadowing convoys and directing submarines and surface ships against them. This resulted in a requirement to carry 14 helicopters and three VSTOL fighters such as the AV-8 Harrier. It was hoped that production SCSs could be built for $100 million each, an eighth of the price of a full sized CVN.\n\nThe resultant design had a full load displacement of and an overall length of . It was to be powered by two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines generating and driving a single shaft, which would propel the ship to a speed of . Weaponry was to be limited, consisting of two Phalanx Close-in weapon systems to defend against anti-ship missiles.\n\nIn 1971 was chosen as a test vessel. Testing began on 18 January 1972. In 1974 she was deployed to the Atlantic Ocean. The vessel was equipped with AV-8A Harrier STOVL fighters and Sea King ASW helicopters. The tests were completed in July 1974; USS \"Guam\" resumed its role as an amphibious assault ship.\n\nThe SCSs were smaller than most fleet aircraft carriers, and the concept was seized upon by nations wanting inexpensive aircraft carriers. Spain's , and her smaller cousin ship, Thailand's , were based on the final US Navy blueprints for a dedicated sea control ship, but with the addition of a ski-jump ramp and follow a similar mission profile.\n\n\n\n"}

It appears in the mythology of Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. It is invoked as a helper by shamans (dukun or bomoh) using black magic.\n\nThe toyol is known by different names from one community to another. The Malay word toyol is \"tuyul\" in Javanese. It is known as \"cohen kroh\" in Khmer, and \"kwee kia\" in Hokkien. In Thai, the male is called \"koman-tang\" while the female is \"koman-lay\". A similar creature exists in Philippine mythology known as tiyanak.\n\nThis creature can be evoked to work with a human under its own terms. There are different methods to possess a Toyol:\n\n\nA Toyol is like an animal, so it needs to be treated as such. In order to foster a closer relationship with this creature, the below offerings should be presented:\n\n\nA person who owns a \"toyol\" uses it mainly to steal things from other people, or to do mischief. According to a well-known superstition, if money or jewelry keeps disappearing mysteriously from your house, a \"toyol\" might be responsible. One way to ward off a \"toyol\" is to place some needles under your money, for \"toyols\" are afraid of being hurt by needles.\n\nAccording to Javanese mythology, the creature is believed to be kept by a person practicing \"pesugihan toyol\" black magic. \"Pesugihan\" is derived from Javanese word \"sugih\" means \"rich\". It is a kind of magic to help people to become rich instantly, but in exchange he or she must perform some rituals or offering \"tumbal\" (sacrifice something) to keep the toyol happy. According to Javanese myth, toyol can be kept for financial gain, but in exchange a female member of the family must allow it to breastfeed from her, sucking blood instead of milk.\n\nThe toyol is traditionally described as looking no different from a near-naked toddler. Modern depictions often give it a goblin-like appearance with green or grey skin, pointed ears, and clouded eyes.\n\nIn old village tales, people keep toyol for theft, sabotage and other minor crimes. With special rituals the toyol can be made powerful and commit murder. A person who suddenly becomes wealthy without explanation might be suspected of keeping a toyol. The toyol is kept in a jar or an urn, and hidden away in a dark place until needed.\n\nWhat happens at the end of the contract is not very clear. It could be that the tablet, along with the urn, is buried in a graveyard (with the relevant rituals), and the spirit is then laid to rest. An alternative method is to dispose of them in the sea. If not properly disposed of, a toyol gets passed down in a family through the generations.\n\nHowever, it can still get released by either the owner or shaman (bomoh) to roam free. Without a master, it would stray into the jungle or visit homes as an observer without disturbing residents. Based on an anecdote, a toyol confessed that it likes to peek into people's lives apart from the occasional distraction of playing with any toys found within houses. Simply put, toyol is quite harmless without a master, but it can turn to crime or mischief under the command of an unscrupulous individual.\n\nAfter stealing, the only traces of its presence are its childlike footprints and fingerprints found at the crime scene if it happens to have dust on its hands and feet. Otherwise, people would not suspect that a toyol had raided their premises.\n\nIt has been said that if any family member of a bride or groom owns a toyol, the toyol will visit the newly wed couple before dawn. And it will suck the blood from the bride's toe until the bride wakes up. This is to enhance the toyol's power. Meaning after sucking bride's toe, the toyol shall become faster and stronger. It is crucial if the owner wants the toyol to be more capable in stealing money.\n\nAlthough seemingly cunning, toyols are supposedly not very intelligent. It is said that they are easily deceived by marbles or beans placed in certain parts of the house. The toyol will start playing with these items until it forgets its task at the intended victim's house. Money placed under mirrors has the potency to ward off toyol due to a fear of their reflection.\n\nIn Thailand, they are known as Koman-tong, for male sprits, and Koman-lay for females. Literally translated as \"Golden Child\". They are used for protection, they can whisper in your ear of impending danger.\nKoman-tongs are usually wandering souls of dead children that the monks would adopt and give them a \"replacement body\". The \"replacement body\" is usually a small statue carved out of tree bark, coral or baby bone. It is then placed in a container, soaked in perfume or chicken blood.\n\nThe story of the Golden Child comes supposedly from a 19th-century Thai tale called, “Khun Chang Khun Paen”. In brief, the story goes:\n\nKhun Paen was a soldier, 400 years previous, a time when supernatural forces played an important part of traditional warfare. Khun Paen had wanted a protective spirit to watch over him in battle. To this end he cut the unborn foetus of his son from his dead wife's womb and took it to a temple to perform an occult rite. He wrapped the child's torso in sacred cloth and roasted it on a fire whilst chanting ritual mantras and dark incantations to create the supernatural being with whom he could communicate.\n\nThe more powerful Kuman-tong are made by sorcerers living in the mountains. They would soak the \"replacement body\" in embalming oil. This ingredient seems to be crucial as it gives the toyol additional powers. Corpse oil is collected by removing the dead corpse's chin (using a knife to cut through the bones) and cooking on a hot pan until the oil oozes out. These Thai ones are more subdued and even tempered, as the monks would chant to them daily.\n\nKwee Kia is the Chinese version of the toyol. These are made from either a fetus that miscarried or been aborted. A medium will take these small corpses and chop off their heads. Once the heads are collected, they will be dried out and cooked to obtain their corpse oil while the bones from the bodies are carved to become replacement bodies. These have to be specially ordered before you can get one.\n\nIf the fetus is five months old, they would carve the replacement body out of its own bone, in which case they are supposedly more powerful. Different Kwee Kia have different uses and different names. Usually the ones made in the deep mountains (山巴) are stronger.\n\n\nToyol have been made into comedy movies in Malaysia with title \"Alamak, Toyol!\"., and Indonesian drama series \n\nThe word \"toyol\" is also the Malay slang for the cheat sheet.\n\n"}

It is one of the tallest mountains in the Hida Mountains at and, along with Mount Fuji and Mount Haku, it is one of Japan's . Tateyama is a term for the mountain consisting of three peaks: Ōnanjiyama (大汝山, 3,015m), Oyama (雄山, 3,003m), and Fuji-no-Oritateyama, (富士ノ折立, 2,999m) which run along a ridge (see photo). Tateyama is the tallest mountain in the Tateyama Mountain Range (立山連峰, Tateyama-renpō).\n\nIt was first climbed by Saeki no Ariyori during Japan's Asuka period. The area was designated the Chūbu-Sangaku National Park on December 4, 1934.\n\nThe \"kanji\" for the mountain (立山 \"Tateyama\"), which is called Tateyama in Japanese, mean \"standing 立 or outstanding 顕\" and \"mountain\", respectively. The pronunciation of \"tate\" is two syllables similar to \"tah-tei\" rather than \"gate\". The Toyama Prefectural Government uses the name Mount Tateyama as an official translation of the Japanese mountain.\n\nThe mountain is composed primarily of granite and gneiss. However, located along the ridge and plateau about west of the summit is a small andesite-dacite stratovolcano. This volcano has an elevation of , and has had minor historical eruptions, the latest in 1839.\n\nTateyama is located in southeastern Toyama Prefecture. At the base of the mountain is the town of Tateyama, which is accessible by train from the prefecture's capital city, Toyama. Public transportation will take climbers and tourists as far as the Murodo Plateau Station at an elevation of , from where individuals may climb to the peak on foot. These are the only glaciers identified in Japan so far.\n\nThe mountain is the source of the following rivers, each of which flows to the Sea of Japan.\n\nLocated by the Oyama peak is Oyama Shrine, where climbers can receive a blessing and warm \"sake\" from a priest. There is also a rest area where climbers may buy food, drinks, and souvenirs. This peak is better known but it is some way from the highest point of the mountain (Onanjiyama).\n\nOn Murodo Plateau the contains Murodō Station is a shopping area and onsen bath. The onsen on Tateyama is famously known for its use of sulfur spring water for the bath, leaving a noticeable aroma that can be detected even while ascending the mountain. Visitors can also find several hiking and walking paths that take them through the beautiful valleys, and take a look at Devil's Valley (Jigokudani). With many volcanic areas in Japan by the same name, visitors are no longer able to walk within the sulfur valley due to gas-related safety concerns. Murodo is a great place to hike from mid-July to mid-November. The summer months are dappled with greenery and some leftover snow from winter, while from mid-September, visitors can enjoy bright autumn colors along the entire route.\n\nThere are charter services from Taipei, Inchon and Thailand during the high season to reach Murodo.\n\nFrom Murodo, visitors can also reach Kurobe Dam, which stands at 186 meters (610 feet), making it the tallest dam in Japan. From Murodō Station, visitors should take the Tateyama Tunnel Trolleybus (10 minutes), followed by the Tateyama Ropeway (7 minutes), and finally the Kurobe Cable Car (5 minutes). From the last stop, a 15-minute walk will take visitors to the dam.\n\nMidagahara is a flat walking area filled with flowing plains interrupted by blue ponds. Near the bus stop that returns visitors to Bijodaira back down the mountain is a slightly hidden walking path. Midagahara is accessible from Tateyama Station via the Tateyama Cable Car (7 minutes) followed by Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route bus (about 40 minutes) that goes in the direction of Murodō Station.\n\nOn clear days, climbers can see Shōmyō Falls (the tallest waterfall in Japan) across the valley while traveling along the main road from Tateyama Station to the Murodo Plateau. For a closer look, visitors can take a bus from Tateyama Station to the Shōmyō Falls stop (about 20 minutes). From there, visitors can walk to the falls up a steady slope (about 20 minutes). There is a large bridge as well as two viewing platforms to get views of the Falls.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2128649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2128649", "title": "Spherically symmetric spacetime", "text": "Spherically symmetric spacetime\n\nIn physics, spherically symmetric spacetimes are commonly used to obtain analytic and numerical solutions to Einstein's field equations in the presence of radially moving dust, compressible or incompressible fluids (such as dark matter), or baryons (hydrogen). Because spherically symmetric spacetimes are by definition irrotational, they are not realistic models of black holes in nature. However, their metrics are considerably simpler than those of rotating spacetimes, making them much easier to analyze. \n\nSpherically symmetric models are not entirely inappropriate: many of them have Penrose diagrams similar to those of rotating spacetimes, and these typically have qualitative features (such as Cauchy horizons) that are unaffected by rotation. One such application is the study of mass inflation due to counter-moving streams of infalling matter in the interior of a black hole.\n\nA spherically symmetric spacetime is a spacetime whose isometry group contains a subgroup which is isomorphic to the rotation group SO(3) and the orbits of this group are 2-spheres (ordinary 2-dimensional spheres in 3-dimensional Euclidean space). The isometries are then interpreted as rotations and a spherically symmetric spacetime is often described as one whose metric is \"invariant under rotations\". The spacetime metric induces a metric on each orbit 2-sphere (and this induced metric must be a multiple of the metric of a 2-sphere). Conventionally, the metric on the 2-sphere is written in polar coordinates as\n\nand so the full metric includes a term proportional to this.\n\nSpherical symmetry is a characteristic feature of many solutions of Einstein's field equations of general relativity, especially the Schwarzschild solution and the Reissner–Nordström solution. A spherically symmetric spacetime can be characterised in another way, namely, by using the notion of Killing vector fields, which, in a very precise sense, preserve the metric. The isometries referred to above are actually local flow diffeomorphisms of Killing vector fields and thus generate these vector fields. For a spherically symmetric spacetime formula_2, there are precisely 3 rotational Killing vector fields. Stated in another way, the dimension of the Killing algebra formula_3 is 3; that is, formula_4. In general, none of these are time-like, as that would imply a static spacetime.\n\nIt is known (see Birkhoff's theorem) that any spherically symmetric solution of the vacuum field equations is necessarily isometric to a subset of the maximally extended Schwarzschild solution. This means that the exterior region around a spherically symmetric gravitating object must be static and asymptotically flat.\n\nConventionally, one uses spherical coordinates formula_5, to write the metric (the line element). Several coordinate charts are possible; these include:\n\n\nOne popular metric, used in the study of mass inflation, is\n\nHere, formula_7 is the standard metric on the unit radius 2-sphere formula_8. The radial coordinate formula_9 is defined so that it is the circumferential radius, that is, so that the proper circumference at radius formula_9\nis formula_11. In this coordinate choice, the parameter formula_12 is defined so that formula_13 is the proper rate of change of the circumferential radius (that is, where formula_14 is the proper time). The parameter formula_15 can be interpreted as the radial derivative of the circumferential radius in a freely-falling frame; this becomes explicit in the tetrad formalism.\n\nNote that the above metric is written as a sum of squares, and therefore it can be understood as explicitly encoding a vierbein, and, in particular, an orthonormal tetrad. That is, the metric tensor can be written as a pullback of the Minkowski metric formula_16:\n\nwhere the formula_18 is the inverse vierbein. The convention here and in what follows is that the roman indexes refer to the flat orthonormal tetrad frame, while the greek indexes refer to the coordinate frame. The inverse vierbein can be directly read off of the above metric as\n\nwhere the signature was take to be formula_23. Written as a matrix, the inverse vierbein is\n\nThe vierbein itself is the inverse(-transpose) of the inverse vierbein\n\nThat is, formula_26 is the identity matrix. \n\nThe particularly simple form of the above is a prime motivating factor for working with the given metric.\n\nThe vierbein relates vector fields in the coordinate frame to vector fields in the tetrad frame, as\nThe most interesting of these two are formula_28 which is the proper time in the rest frame, and formula_29 which is the radial derivative in the rest frame. By construction, as noted earlier, formula_12 was the proper\nrate of change of the circumferential radius; this can now be explicitly written as \n\nSimilarly, one has\n\nwhich describes the gradient (in the free-falling tetrad frame) of the circumferential radius along the radial direction. This is not in general unity; compare, for example, to the standard Swarschild solution, or the Reissner–Nordström solution. The sign of formula_15 effectively determines \"which way is down\"; the sign of formula_15 distinguishes incoming and outgoing frames, so that formula_35 is an ingoing frame, and formula_36 is an outgoing frame.\n\nThese two relations on the circumferential radius provide another reason why this particular parameterization of the metric is convenient: it has a simple intuitive characterization.\n\nThe connection form in the tetrad frame can be written in terms of the Christoffel symbols formula_37 in the tetrad frame, which are given by\n\nand all others zero.\n\nA complete set of expressions for the Riemann tensor, the Einstein tensor and th Weyl curvature scalar can be found in Hamilton & Avelino. The Einstein equations become\n\nwhere formula_45 is the covariant time derivative (and formula_46 the Levi-Civita connection), formula_47 the radial pressure (\"not\" the isotropic pressure!), and formula_48 the radial energy flux. The mass formula_49 is the Misner-Thorne mass or interior mass, given by\n\nAs these equations are effectively two-dimensional, they can be solved without overwhelming difficulty for a variety of assumptions about the nature of the infalling material (that is, for the assumption of a spherically symmetric black hole that is accreting charged or neutral dust, gas, plasma or dark matter, of high or low temperature, \"i.e.\" material with various equations of state.)\n\n\n"}

Participation in the Program is not mandatory or compulsory, but any U.S. citizen who is not legally prohibited from owning a firearm may purchase a military surplus rifle from the CMP, provided they are a member of a CMP affiliated club. The CMP operates, not as a government entity, but through a network of affiliated private organizations, shooting clubs, and state associations that cover every state in the U.S. The organizations, clubs, and associations offer firearms safety training and marksmanship courses as well as the opportunity for continued practice and competition.\n\nThe Office of the Director of Civilian Marksmanship (DCM) was created by the U.S. Congress as part of the 1903 War Department Appropriations Act. The original purpose was to provide civilians an opportunity to learn and practice marksmanship skills so they would be skilled marksmen if later called on to serve in the U.S. military. Formation was precipitated by adoption of the M1903 Springfield rifle as the national service arm. Civilians experienced with popular contemporary lever-action rifles were unable to sustain an equivalent rate of fire from the unfamiliar bolt action M1903 rifle.\n\nOver the years the emphasis of the program shifted to focus on youth development through marksmanship. From 1916 until 1996 the CMP was administered by the U.S. Army. Title XVI of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 (Public Law 104-106, 10 February 1996) created the \"Corporation for the Promotion of Rifle Practice & Firearms Safety\" (CPRPFS) to take over administration and promotion of the CMP. The CPRPFS is a tax-exempt non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation chartered by the U.S. Congress, but is not an agency of the U.S. government (Title 36, United States Code, Section 40701 \"et seq.\"). Apart from a donation of surplus .22 and .30 caliber rifles in the Army's inventory to the CMP, the CMP receives no federal funding.\n\n\"The National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice\" (NBPRP), an advisory board to the Secretary of the Army (SA), which was created in 1903, was disestablished by this law and replaced by the CPRPFS. The initial board was appointed by the SA and is responsible to develop all policies and procedures for the implementation of all aspects of the CMP.\n\nThe CMP maintains three main offices: \"CMP North\" at Camp Perry near Port Clinton, Ohio, \"CMP South\" in Anniston, Alabama and the CMP Talladega Marksmanship Park in Talladega, Alabama.\n\nThe sale of surplus U.S. army rifles in particular has been quite popular, with the CMP offering M1 Garand, M1903 Springfield, M1917 Enfield, M1 Carbine, .22 caliber (surplus and commercial target), and air rifles (commercial target) for sale to members of affiliated organizations. Ammunition and other accessories are also sold through the CMP's online store.\n\nThe programs facilitated by the CMP foster the teaching of safety, responsibility, leadership, and competitive excellence in the shooting sports. The CMP supports, sponsors, and hosts various rifle and pistol competitions across the nation including the National Matches at Camp Perry, they formally hosted the U.S. Olympics Trials for 10 meter air rifle, they also host the annual Junior Olympic 3-position air rifle matches, as well as a variety of national junior championships. To carry out its mission of advancing the shooting sports, the CMP runs camps and clinics throughout the year, most notably, their summer camp program offers camps in standing air rifle, 3-position air rifle, and recently added 3-position smallbore. \n\nIn July 2003, the CMP launched Competition Tracker, the first online results system for the shooting sports. Originally designed specifically for the National Trophy matches, the CMP now uses Competition Tracker as the official results bulletin of every CMP competition. In March 2006, during the JROTC National Championships, the CMP used Competition Tracker, in conjunction with Sius Ascor electronic targets, to provide real time results on the web. On average, it was 45 seconds from the time a shooter fired a shot to when his or her shot value was seen on the Internet. The CMP continues to be innovative today, they are currently researching Visual Image Scoring technology that will allow competitors to score traditional paper targets electronically.\n\nThe U.S. armed forces are authorized to wear marksmanship competition badges, in accordance with each service's regulations. These badges are awarded based on points earned at CMP sponsored competitions or high placement at special CMP competitions. The following is a list of marksmanship competition badges authorized for wear on U.S. military service uniforms based on points earned at CMP competitions:\n\n\n\n"}

Inverness is the only club to have hosted the U.S. Open, U.S. Amateur, U.S. Senior Open, and U.S. Junior Amateur Championships. From 1935 to 1954, it also hosted the Inverness Invitational Four-Ball. Byron Nelson served as the club's head golf professional from 1940 to 1944 and considered it his \"home course.\" S.P. Jermain, the club's founder and first Board President, was credited with conceiving the idea for the Ryder Cup. The championship course was designed by renowned architect Donald Ross.\n\nInverness Club is to host the 2021 Solheim Cup.\n\nInverness was founded in 1903, when many of Toledo's wealthiest citizens purchased a parcel of land and built a nine-hole golf course. The course was eventually expanded to 18 holes. In 1916, the club hired Donald Ross to construct a championship-caliber golf course, which was finished by the end of 1918. In his unpublished book, \"Golf Has Never Failed Me\", Ross discussed the design of Inverness and only six other courses, out of the hundreds he designed.\n\nBefore 1920 in the United States, golf professionals were prohibited from entering the clubhouse, as they were once seen as little more than servants to their patron members of the country club. As professional golf tournaments began to appear in the early part of the 20th century, the visiting pros were treated the same as the home pros.\n\nBy 1920, attitudes had begun to change. Sylvanus Pierre Jermain, considered \"the father of public golf in Toledo\", lobbied the USGA and the members of Inverness to agree to allowing all players, including pros, into the clubhouse at the upcoming 1920 U.S. Open. Both parties agreed, and Inverness thus became the first golf club in the U.S. to allow pros in the clubhouse.\n\nAs a gift for the boldness and generosity Inverness had shown, Walter Hagen gathered other professional golfers when the U.S. Open returned to Inverness in 1931 so that a gift could be purchased for the club. Together they purchased a grandfather clock for the club house which is still housed there today. On the brass plate of the clock, this inscription was written:\n\nByron Nelson was the head professional at Inverness Club from 1940 to 1944. He considered Inverness his home course and credits his time there for his record breaking performance, winning 18 of 35 PGA tournaments including 11 in a row, in 1945. Lloyd Gullickson became the head professional at Inverness Club, succeeding Nelson. Gullickson remained at Inverness as the head professional until his retirement in 1965. Herman Lang, who was the first assistant to Nelson in 1941, was the head pro from 1966-1980. \n\nIn preparation for championships, the course has been renovated four times. In 2016, Inverness Club engaged golf course architect, Andrew Green, who carefully researched original drawings and historic photography to restore the artistry of Donald Ross's design. In addition, Green modernized tee boxes and bunkering systems that are fitting to today's championship courses. Green's design has restored Ross’s classic championship design, with Inverness Club now playing over 7,700 yards. \n\nInverness was ranked #47 on Golfweek Magazine's America's Top 200 Classic Courses and #88 by Golf Digest.\n\nWinners of major tournaments held at Inverness Club include:\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Junior Amateur\n\n\nThe club also hosted the NCAA Men's Golf Championship in 1944 and 2009.\n\n"}

The clock still exists, but was deactivated at the time of its relocation to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nThe clock is similar to other mechanical clocks, except that it does not need winding.

They were known for their intricate guitar work, vocal harmonies, and socially conscious lyrics which reflected the concerns of their generation — especially the Vietnam War, and the struggles for personal and political freedom. Their greatest commercial success was the song \"One Toke Over the Line\" from their 1970 album \"Tarkio\". They had two other singles on the Billboard charts: \"Tarkio Road\" (1970) and \"Shake Off The Demon\" (1971). They continue to perform, both separately and together, usually in the Midwest of the USA.\n\nThe two Midwestern natives crossed paths numerous times at various coffeehouse gigs before settling in Los Angeles to write music together in 1968, producing their first two albums, \"Down in L.A.\" and \"Weeds\". Even though mutual friends in bands such as The Association and Buffalo Springfield lived in Los Angeles, they left California during 1969, returning to Kansas City, Missouri, where they made a meager living playing college towns. They derived the name of their next album, \"Tarkio\", from a regular gig they played in Tarkio, Missouri. This album was their most successful commercially, featuring the song \"One Toke Over the Line\", which they wrote as a joke while preparing backstage for a performance.\n\n\"One Toke Over The Line\" was performed on \"The Lawrence Welk Show\", a television program known for its conservative, family-oriented format, by a duo known as \"Gail and Dale\". At the conclusion of the performance of the song, Welk remarked, without any hint of irony, \"There you've heard a modern spiritual by Gail and Dale.\" This caused Michael Brewer to comment:\n\nThe Vice President of the United States, Spiro Agnew, named us personally as a subversive to American youth, but at exactly the same time Lawrence Welk performed the crazy thing and introduced it as a gospel song. That shows how absurd it really is. Of course, we got more publicity than we could have paid for.\nBrewer & Shipley have performed with many notable acts, including Stephen Stills, Bruce Springsteen, Black Sabbath, and Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead, who played pedal steel guitar for \"Oh, Mommy\".\n\nDuring 1989 they performed a gig together, and a brief time later began composing together again, producing two albums, \"SHANGHAI\" (1993) and \"Heartland\" (1997). They have continued to tour together, part-time, since the 1990s. In 2011, the acoustic duo performed on Main Street in Tarkio, Missouri, to commemorate the 40th Anniversary of the \"Tarkio\" album. At present, Michael Brewer lives outside of Branson, Missouri. Tom Shipley lives in Rolla, Missouri, where he is part of the staff of Missouri University of Science & Technology (formerly the University of Missouri - Rolla). He is semi-retired as manager of video productions and continues to work on special video productions for the university. He is a member of Engineers Without Borders and has traveled twice to the Amazon and Andes of Bolivia to produce videos for the organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is used as a dietary supplement.\n\nPolicosanol was originally derived from sugar cane but the chemicals can also be isolated from beeswax, cereal grains, grasses, leaves, fruits, nuts, and seeds of many foods. Plant waxes consist of very long chain fatty acids that have been reduced to very long chain alcohols. Policosanols are very long chain alcohols with carbon backbones ranging from 24 to 34 carbons. \n\nThe first policosanol supplements were produced by Dalmer Laboratories in Cuba; studies conducted and published by that group have found that policosanol is safe and effective as a lipid-lowering agent. However these studies were small, and efforts by groups outside of Cuba have failed to replicate these results.\n\nA meta-analysis in 2005 concluded that human policosanol consumption is safe and well tolerated and is effective at lowering the blood cholesterol. As of 2010, they were marketed as lipid-lowering agents in the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Canada. Furthermore, another meta-analysis was published in 2018 with 22 studies and 1886 subjects showed policosanol could improve dyslipidemia with raising HDL. The blood pressure lowering effect of Cuban policosanol has been shown in an animal model using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and a human trial.\n\n"}

{"id": "2128758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2128758", "title": "Lazy Jones", "text": "Lazy Jones\n\nLazy Jones is a computer game for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, MSX and Tatung Einstein. It was written by David Whittaker and released by Terminal Software in 1984. The Spectrum version was ported by Simon Cobb.\n\n\"Lazy Jones\" is essentially a collection of fifteen smaller sub-games. The game takes place inside a hotel with three floors, connected by an elevator. The character is a lazy hotel employee who does not much care for his work, but prefers to sneak into the rooms to play video games instead.\n\nThe main screen in \"Lazy Jones\" is the hotel interior. There, the character can use the elevator to travel freely between the three floors, but he must watch out for enemies: the current hotel manager on the top floor, the ghost of the previous manager on the bottom floor, and a haunted cleaning cart on the middle floor. The enemies only walk around and do not pursue the character, but contact with them is fatal.\n\nEach floor has six rooms, three on each side of the elevator. Each room can be entered once. Inside most rooms is a video game, which the character immediately begins playing. As well as the video games, there is the hotel bar, a bed, a cleaning closet and a toilet. The bar works like a video game, but the bed, the cleaning closet and the toilet are useless decorations (intentionally added, because Whittaker had run out of ideas for new games).\n\nWhen all rooms have been visited, the game starts over again, but increasingly faster, each time.\n\nOne of the tracks of \"Lazy Jones\"'s soundtrack was sampled by German electro project Zombie Nation for their 1999 hit single \"Kernkraft 400\".\n\nThe plot of the game is simple- a hotel care taker named Jones is bored and decides to go in the rooms and play games.\n\nThe various sub-games are generally simplified versions of famous 1970s and 1980s video games, such as \"Space Invaders\", \"Frogger\", \"Snake\", \"H.E.R.O.\", Breakout or \"Chuckie Egg\". Their plots and gameplay are very simple, and in most of them the player simply must avoid incoming enemies long enough to score many points. In some, the player must shoot enemies to score points.\n\nWhittaker developed each sub-game individually in BASIC first, to make sure they worked, then converted each one of them, almost line by line, into Assembly code.\n\nEach sub-game has a time limit. In some sub-games it is possible to \"die\", thus ending the sub-game prematurely, while others only end after the time limit expires. But this also depends of the portrayed game version. While a \"death\" in the Commodore 64 may return the game character to a certain point in the screen, in the MSX version the same death results in the premature end of the sub-game.\n\nThe fourteen video games are as follows:\n\nIn the MSX and Tatung Einstein versions, \"Jay Walk\" is replaced by \"Wafers II\", in which the player uses two controlled spaceships (one vertically and one horizontally) to jointly hit the spinning wafers.\n\nIn the hotel bar, your character stands in front of the (rather wide) bar. The barman and the only other patron, hopelessly drunk, are both moving back and forth across the bar, at different speeds. Pressing the fire button while standing in front of both a drink and the barman at the same time earns you points. The drunk patron bars your movement but can be jumped over.\n\nThe sub-games where it is possible to \"die\" prematurely are \"Eggie Chuck\", \"Jay Walk\", \"Res Q\" and \"The Wall\".\n\nThe sub-games that only end when the time limit runs out are \"99 Red Balloons\", \"Laser Jones\", \"Outland\", \"Scoot\", \"Star Dust\", \"The Hills Are Alive\", \"The Reflex\", \"The Turk\", \"Wild Wafers\", \"Wipeout\", \"Wafers II\" and the hotel bar.\n\n(In the MSX version, sub-games ending exclusively by running out of time limit: \"Outland\", \"The Reflex\", \"Wild Wafers\", \"Wafers II\", \"Wipeout\" and the bar).\n\nThe game's chiptune music has a very characteristic sound that is distinct from many other C64 games. Each of the 21 subtunes is using only two voices of the SID chip which in turn use the same sawtooth sound. One voice plays a simple octave bassline for the most part, while the other one is adding the melody. All the tunes share the same tempo as well and they change seamlessly when playing another sub game.\n\nAssociations of subtunes to sub-games vary depending of the portrayed computer version, so a subtune used in the Commodore 64 version to a certain sub-game was not necessarily used as soundtrack to the same sub-game in the MSX version (see example below).\n\nSubtune 21, named \"Star Dust\" (in the MSX version, soundtrack to \"The Wall\" sub-game), was used by the German producer team Zombie Nation in their song Kernkraft 400. Florian Senfter (\"Splank!\") later paid an undisclosed sum to David Whittaker for the use of the melody.\n\nThe tune and title for 99 Red Balloons comes from the English name of the song 99 Luftballons by German songstress Nena. (This having been the version which reached #1 on the UK singles chart).\n\nVisage's \"Fade to Grey\" is also heard.\n\n"}

The seal shall have a star of five points, encircled by olive and live oak branches, and the words 'the State of Texas.'\"\n\nThe reverse of the seal was adopted in 1961 has a more detailed design, which is similar to other coat of arms found in Latin America; The original 1961 act of legislature which established it was unusual in that the act didn't actually define the reverse seal and was simply a picture of the design; it wasn't until 1991 that the seal was actually defined in writing by law as follows:\n\n[T]he design for the reverse side of the Great Seal of Texas shall consist of a shield, the lower half of which is divided into two parts; on the shield's lower left is a depiction of the cannon of the Battle of Gonzales; on the shield's lower right is a depiction of Vince's Bridge; on the upper half of the shield is a depiction of the Alamo; the shield is circled by live oak and olive branches, and the unfurled flags of the Kingdom of France, the Kingdom of Spain, the United Mexican States, the Republic of Texas, the Confederate States of America, and the United States of America; above the shield is emblazoned the motto, \"REMEMBER THE ALAMO\", and beneath the shield are the words, \"TEXAS ONE AND INDIVISIBLE\"; over the entire shield, centered between the flags, is a white five-pointed star.\nThe flags on the seal are the \"six flags over Texas\", of the six nations that have had sovereignty over some or all of the current territory of Texas. The original seal pictured in the 1961 act represented the C.S.A. with an Army of Tennessee Confederate battle flag; the 1991 law replaced this with the first C.S.A. flag, known as the \"Stars and Bars\".\n\nThe seal of Texas has changed 5 times since independence from Mexico in 1836. The original Great Seal of the Republic was created on December 10, 1836, by the Congress, with a bill providing that \"for the future the national seal of this republic shall consist of a single star, with the letters 'Republic of Texas', circular on said seal, which seal shall also be circular\". After initial hopes for the quick annexation of Texas into the United States grew dim, the Third Congress modified the seal and created a national arms in 1839. The bill stated, \"The national arms of the Republic of Texas be, and the same is hereby declared to be a white star of five points, on an azure ground, encircled by an olive and live oak branches\", as well as that \"The national great seal of this Republic shall, from and after the passage of this act, bear the arms of this nation ..., and the letters 'Republic of Texas'\". When Texas joined the Union in 1845, the new state constitution retained the seal, changing only the word \"Republic\" to \"State\", and removed the background from the arms. It was not until 1992 that the seal and arms were standardized to reflect the specific language in the constitution and removing the various superfluous symbols and errors that were found on a majority of seals at the time. Despite this as of 2017 a majority of state offices use seals based on older unstandardized seals with Post Oak leaves instead of the specified Live Oak leaves.\n\nOn November 19, 1946, the Pentagon's National Guard Bureau advised all states that the United States Air Force wanted state national guard aircraft to have identifying insignia on the fuselage. The Texas Adjutant General's Department decided to use the state seal as the identifying insignia. The department's chief engineer, Colonel Maybin H. Wilson, researched the design of the seal with the assistance of Werner W. Dornberger, an architectural engineering professor at The University of Texas; Bertha Brandt, assistant archivist of the state library; and Dorman Winfrey, archivist of The University of Texas. In 1956, Octavio A. Martinez, an architectural engineering student at The University of Texas, prepared an eighteen and three-fourth inch watercolor of the seal. This design was faithful to the constitutional description and omitted erroneous details that had crept into the seal over the years, such as the addition of stars and diamonds in the bottom of the seal's outer ring and the use of post oak leaves instead of \"live oak\" leaves. Unfortunately, the original Martinez watercolor has been lost.\n\nThere are also numerous seals of the different departments of Texas government, including seals for the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor. They are all based upon the state seal of Texas.\n\nGeneral state law does not require counties to adopt a seal. However, laws do provide seals for the County Commissioners' Court, County Clerk, and other county offices. Until 1975, the Commissioners' Court seal consisted of a star with five points and the words, \"Commissioners Court, ---- County, Texas\". A Commissioners' Court may now select its own seal design, with the approval of the Texas Secretary of State.\n\nCounties commonly have a seal or symbol to identify the county unofficially. Many have adopted symbols with the lone star and live oak/olive branches in the center. Some counties have maintained \"The State of Texas\" at the top, while adding the county name below, while others have replaced \"The State of Texas\" with the county name, with some adding the year of county establishment at the bottom.\n\nNotable exceptions include Harris County (which uses a symbol with the flag of Texas in the center) and Collin County (which uses a Texas Flag in a stylized C).\n\n\n"}

It is the second-largest motorway service area operator behind Moto. It also operates hotels and motels.\n\nOpened in 1959, the service area at Newport Pagnell on the M1 motorway near Milton Keynes by Motorway Services Ltd was the company's first service area under the Forte name and was the second service area to be constructed on the fledgling UK motorway network. The name \"Welcome Break\" came from a chain of rival restaurants to Little Chef, created by Allen Jones. These restaurants eventually either became Happy Eaters or closed. The name was brought back when Hanson Trust renamed Ross Food's service stations. The company's portfolio was expanded to five motorway service areas during periods under the ownership of the Imperial Group and subsequently the Hanson Trust before being purchased by Trusthouse Forte in 1986. Under this deal, the Welcome Break name was adopted across the entire estate, with Trusthouse Forte's sixteen existing service areas re-branded.\n\nIn January 1996, the Forte Group was the subject of a £3.9 billion hostile takeover by the British media group Granada. Due to Granada's existing major presence in the motorway services market, a subsequent investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission ordered Granada to sell 27 of the Welcome Break sites. The company was eventually bought by Investcorp in 1997 for £476M. Investcorp then sold Welcome Break to Appia Investments in March 2008 for £500M.\n\nIn August 2018 Applegreen agreed to purchase the majority of Welcome Break for €361.8M.\n\nThe facilities available at Welcome Break service areas varies at each site, with most sites open 24 hours a day throughout the year. Typically, each service area comprises a café or restaurant, a retail outlet, a hotel and a petrol station. All sites have WHSmith, Burger King, an eat-in restaurant, a coffee shop (Starbucks Coffee), and a petrol station (Shell or BP).\n\nThe majority of hotels at Welcome Break service areas are franchises of Days Inn or Ramada; many of these were once branded under Welcome Break's own brand, \"Welcome Lodge\"; the last of these, at Newport Pagnell and Charnock Richard, were rebranded to Days Inns in May 2009 and also took over operation of three former PURPLE hotels at Cambridge, Peterborough, and Stevenage in July 2009, each three have reopened as Days Inn taking its total to 26. In September 2012, Welcome Break opened a Days Inn at the new Cobham Service area on the M25, and 2013 saw a rebrand of Days Hotel London North and Days Inn London Stansted into Ramada hotels. In December 2014, Welcome Break purchased Days Hotel Wakefield, and after a full refurbishment it was reopened as Ramada Wakefield in January 2015.\n\nWhen Welcome Break chain was sold by Granada, branches of Little Chef at those sites were replaced a similar table service restaurant, Red Hen. High prices earned the chain the nickname \"Little Thief\".\n\nEat In became Welcome Break's own brand self-service restaurant. However, these have since been replaced with food courts, featuring a selection of brands varying from location to location:\n\nRecently, Welcome Break service areas have followed the industry-wide trend towards partnership with High Street brands. W H Smith stores have been introduced at the majority of Welcome Break sites as a replacement for the traditional unbranded retail outlets. Initially launched as a trial store at the Newport Pagnell site in February 2007, W H Smith stores have now been rolled out across the Welcome Break portfolio.\n\nFone Bitz sell electronics across the motorway network and operate at most Welcome Break sites. Fone Bitz sell a range of Mobile Phone, iPad, iPod, Laptop, electronic and car accessories in general.\n\nWelcome Break Gaming is a self branded betting arcade located at all Welcome Break sites, except the Welcome Break operated Days Inn hotels and motels.\n\nIn July 2011 it was announced that the green energy provider Ecotricity will be providing fast and normal electric vehicle charging stations at Welcome Break service stations, linking London in the south with Exeter in the west and Edinburgh in the north.\n\nWelcome Break introduced a new company logo in September 2006. The swan, integral to the previous company logo, has been removed. The new logo features a black background with the words 'welcome' and 'break' in green and white respectively. Each site now also has a large mural depicting a local landmark unique to that site. Many of these were commissioned from artist David Fisher.\n\n\n\n\n"}

At national level, GNR also has duties of customs enforcement, coastal control, nature protection, search and rescue operations and state ceremonial guards of honor.\n\nSince the 2000s, the GNR has provided detachments for participation in international operations in Iraq, East Timor and other theatres.\n\nThe GNR deploys over 26,000 personnel over 90 percent of Portuguese territory. The GNR are deployed in Bosnia as part of IFOR/SFOR/EUFOR Althea. and 140 GNR were also deployed between 2006 and 2012 in Timor-Leste as part of UNMIT.\n\nThe National Republican Guard is in peacetime subordinate to the Ministry of Internal Administration for recruitment, administration, discipline and operational control and is also subordinate to the Ministry of National Defence for \"uniformisation and normalisation\" of military doctrine, armament and equipment. In wartime or situations of crisis, the GNR can be placed under the operational control of the Armed Forces General Staff.\n\nUntil 2007, the GNR maintained a traditional organization, whose bases still followed the organizational structure established in the early 20th century. This organization included: territorial units (four territorial brigades, that were designated \"battalions\" until 1993), special units (the Fiscal and the Traffic Brigades) and reserve units (the Cavalry and the Infantry regiments). The old organization also included a central structure that reflected the command of a military field division, including a military-type staff.\n\nIn 2006, the multinational consulting company Accenture made a study, requested by the Government of Portugal, that recommended the change of the organization of the Portuguese security forces, including a radical reorganization of the GNR.\n\nMost of the recommendations regarding GNR were accepted and, in accordance with the Law No. 63/2007 (new Organic Law of the GNR), its traditional structure was replaced by a new and considerably different one, that was implemented in early 2009.\n\nThe GNR is commanded by a general officer, with the title of Commandant-General (\"Comandante-Geral\").\n\nThe National Republican Guard now includes the following:\n\nSource:\n\nReporting directly to the Commandant-General are the following:\n\nThe old four-brigade structure was replaced by a system of territorial commands, each covering a district or an autonomous region. Each territorial command – commanded by a colonel or lieutenant colonel – includes detachments – commanded by majors, captains or junior officer, Sub-detachments – led by junior officers – and posts – led by sergeants. Each territorial command usually includes a traffic detachment (from the former Traffic Brigade) and a detachment of intervention. The territorial commands of the Azores and Madeira play, essentially, just a coastal monitoring and fiscal actions, respectively, under the functional dependence of the UCC and UAF. The current territorial commands correspond essentially to the previous territorial groups of the old territorial brigades. With the extinction of the territorial brigades by the end of 2008, the territorial commands were placed in direct dependence on the central structure of command of GNR;\n\nThe territorial commands are as follows:\n\nSpecial Units fall directly under the Operations Command (\"Comando Operacional\").\n\n\n\n\nThe National Republican Guard is the direct descendant of the Royal Police Guard created in the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nThe Royal Guard of the Police of Lisbon (\"Guarda Real da Polícia de Lisboa\") was created in 1801 by Prince Regent John on the initiative of the Intendant-General of the Police of the Court and the Kingdom, Pina Manique. It took as a model the French Gendarmerie (1791).\n\nFollowing the creation of Lisbon's Royal Guard of the Police, a similar Guard was created in Porto. After the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Rio de Janeiro, after the invasion of Portugal by the Napoleonic forces in 1807, a similar Royal Guard of the Police of Rio de Janeiro was created, this being the origin of the present military police of that state and of the other member states of Brazil.\n\nAt the end of May, 1834, as a result of the Civil War, King Peter IV, assuming the regency in name of his daughter Queen Mary II, disbanded the Royal Police Guard in Lisbon and Porto, creating the \"Municipal Guards\" of Lisbon and Porto on the basis of similar conditions.\n\nIn 1868 both of the Guards were put under a unified Commandant-General, installed in the Carmo Barracks in Lisbon, which today still is the Headquarters of the GNR. The Municipal Guard was considered part of the Army, but was dependent on the Ministry of Internal Affairs for all matters regarding public security.\n\nAfter the 5 October 1910 revolution, which substituted the Constitutional Monarchy with the Republic, the new regime changed the name of the Municipal Guard to the Republican Guard (\"Guarda Republicana\"), keeping the same organization. At this time, plans were already being done for the transformation of this Guard into a National Republican Guard, covering all the Portuguese territory.\n\nIn 1911, the Republican Guard was transformed in the National Republican Guard (GNR): this was to be a security force consisting of military personnel organised in a special corps of troops depending, in peace time, on the Ministry of Internal Administration, for the purpose of conscription, administration and execution with regards to its mission, and the Ministry of the National Defense for the purpose of uniformization and normalization of the military doctrine, as well as for its armament and equipment. In case of war or situation of crisis, the forces of National Republican Guard will, in terms of the respective laws and for operational effect, be subordinated to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\nIn 1993 the National Republican Guard absorbed the independent Fiscal Guard (\"Guarda Fiscal\") that became the Fiscal Brigade of the GNR. In 2006 a new GNR unit was created with the purpose of firefighting and was named GIPS.\n\nA unit of the GNR was deployed in Iraq during the NATO mission MNF-I within the Italian led Multinational Specialized Unit.\n\nA small contingent of GNR forces were deployed in Timor-Leste in 2006 (see video below).\n\nPolice services in Portugal have always used a wide range of firearms in 9×19mm to equip their personnel. \n\nAt the start of the 21st century they chose the Glock 19 as the standard law enforcement handgun, which came only to replace the old Walther PP and Walther P38. Any other handgun in a caliber above .32 ACP will remain in service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2128879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2128879", "title": "Relaxer", "text": "Relaxer\n\nA relaxer is a type of lotion or cream generally used by people with tight curls or very curly hair which makes hair easier to straighten by chemically \"relaxing\" the natural curls. The active agent is usually a strong alkali, although some formulations are based on ammonium thioglycolate instead, not to mention formaldehyde.\n\nThe first documented history of the relaxer began with Garrett Augustus Morgan in 1909. His hair straighten cream was found accidentally when trying to find a solution to ease friction of sewing machine in his tailor shop. Morgan tested his cream on a neighboring dog's fur. With the success of the cream, he established G.A. Morgan Hair Refining Company and began selling his product to Black/mixed people.\n\nHair relaxing, or lanthionization, colloquially known as a perm, can be performed by a professional cosmetologist in a salon, a professional barber in a barbershop or at home with relaxer kits. As with hair dye, the treated portion of the hair moves away from the scalp as the new growth of untreated hair sprouts up from the roots, requiring periodic retreatment (about every 8–11 weeks) to maintain a consistent appearance.\n\nThe relaxer is applied to the base of the hair shaft and remains in place for a \"cooking\" interval, during which it alters the hair's texture by a process of controlled damage to the protein structure. The hair can be significantly weakened by the physical overlap of excessive applications or by a single excessive one, leading to brittleness, breakage, or even widespread alopecia.\n\nWhen the relaxer has worked to the desired degree, the hair is rinsed clean. Regardless of formula, relaxers are always alkaline to some degree, so it is prudent to neutralize or even slightly acidify the hair with a suitable shampoo immediately afterward. The prompt use of hair conditioner is also important in order to replace some of the natural oils that were stripped away by the process.\n\nThio relaxers use ATG, or ammonium thioglycolate, which is also used in permanent waving, but at a much higher pH and concentration than used in permanent waves. It is usually higher than a pH of 10. These relaxers are also thicker with a higher viscosity, or thickness, which makes for an easier relaxer application. Thio relaxers break the disulfide bonds in hair, similar to the permanent waving process. When enough of the disulfide bonds in the hair are broken, the relaxer is rinsed from the hair and the hair is towel dried. After towel drying, a neutralizer of some sort is applied to the hair.\n\nGarrett Augustus Morgan observed that it is possible to change the basic structure of the hair shaft when certain chemicals penetrate the cortical layer. Hair relaxing products often require washing and combing with soap which had been made with excess lye. The scalp can suffer severe chemical burns if over exposed to lye or no-lye relaxers.\n\nA lye relaxer consists of sodium hydroxide (also known as NaOH or lye) mixed with water, petroleum jelly, mineral oil, and emulsifiers to create a creamy consistency. On application, the caustic \"lye cream\" permeates the protein structure of the hair and weakens its internal bonds, causing the natural curls to loosen out as the entire fiber swells open. No special deactivation step is required after washing the lye cream out, other than the routine pH adjustment and hair-conditioning.\n\nManufacturers vary the sodium hydroxide content of the solution from 5% to 10% and the pH between 10 and 14.\n\nEntirely distinct from the chemical concept of base as a wider definition for \"alkaline\", lye relaxers may be labelled as \"base\" or \"no base\". In this instance, the \"base\" refers to a preliminary coating of petroleum jelly onto the scalp to protect it from being irritated or burned by the lye cream. \"No base\" creams have a lower concentration of lye and may be applied directly to the hair roots without requiring the protective \"base\" layer, although these weaker products may still irritate the skin of some people who must therefore coat their scalps beforehand anyway.\n\nBecause of increasing awareness of the potential dangers of sodium hydroxide found in traditional relaxer formulas, many women have begun abandoning them. \"No-lye\" relaxers have become increasingly popular. \"No-lye\" relaxers are of three main types. One type operates on the same general principle as lye relaxers but uses a slightly weaker alkaline agent, such as potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, or guanidine hydroxide. The last of these is not pre-formulated, but rather is generated at the time of use by combining a cream containing calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) with an \"activating solution\" of guanidine carbonate.\n\nAnother type of \"no-lye\" relaxer uses ammonium thioglycolate, which is also known as perm salt for its use in permanent waves. Perm salt is a chemical reducing agent which selectively weakens the hair's cystine bonds instead of disrupting the entire protein, but strips out the natural oils even more thoroughly than the alkali hydroxide products. Afterward, the thioglycolate must be oxidized with a special solution of hydrogen peroxide or sodium bromate.\n\nLastly, in most relaxers sold for home use, the active agents are ammonium sulfite and ammonium bisulfite (the two compounds are interchangeable, depending on the surrounding pH). These also selectively reduce the cystine bonds, but are much weaker and work more slowly. Nevertheless, their mild action minimizes (but does not entirely eliminate) collateral irritation to the skin.\n\nEarly in the 1900s hair relaxing products emerged, such as \"G.A. brandi's hair Cream.\" Sale of \"lye relaxers\" began in 1917 by companies such as Proline. They also produced the first commercial \"no lye relaxer\" using potassium hydroxide in 1919.\n\nA product falsely marketed as chemical-free in the 1990s, the Rio Hair Naturalizer System, led to a class action lawsuit against the manufacturer, the World Rio Corporation Inc., when the acidic chemicals it contained caused scalp damage and/or hair loss to thousands of users. The product was eventually withdrawn from the market.\n\nA Down Perm () is a type of hair relaxing product used in Asia with its origins in South Korea. It is designed to relax Asian hair which tends to stick out, most noticeably after washing it.\n\nThe hair of some Africans is elliptical in shape and therefore very tightly curled (Asian hair tends to be round and Caucasian hair is in-between). The relaxer cream breaks down the chemical bonds of the hair shaft, disrupting the elliptical shape and reconstructing the bonds in a different way. Though hair follicles themselves are not damaged, the hair can become very brittle and break off. There is also risk of scalp burns if the relaxer comes into contact with the skin. Some professionals apply a scalp base cream or protector prior to application to protect the client's scalp from chemical burns. Cosmetic products are not subject to pre-market approval by the Food and Drug Administration and a complete list of ingredients is not mandatory; however many brands of hair relaxers list phthalate directly as one of their chemical ingredients. Phthalates from cosmetic products can be inhaled or absorbed by the skin and these have been shown to have estrogenic effects in cell models and experimental animals. It also can cause long-term damage that may not recover.\n\nA prospective cohort study of more than 23,000 African-American women showed an association between the use of relaxers and risk of uterine leiomyomata. The incidence of this disease is 2 to 3 times higher in African-Americans than Caucasian women. However, the paper makes no causal connections between relaxers and uterine fibroids, even though some media outlets have reported otherwise.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2128898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2128898", "title": "Hirnantian", "text": "Hirnantian\n\nThe Hirnantian is the final internationally recognized stage of the Ordovician Period of the Paleozoic Era. It was of short duration, lasting about 1.4 million years, from to Ma (million years ago). The early part of the Hirnantian was characterized by cold temperatures, major glaciation, and a severe drop in sea level. In the latter part of the Hirnantian, temperatures rose, the glaciers melted, and sea level returned to the same or to a slightly higher level than it had been prior to the glaciation.\n\nMost scientists believe that this climatic oscillation caused the major extinction event that took place during this time. In fact, the Hirnantian (also known as the End Ordovician and the Ordovician-Silurian) mass extinction event represents the second largest such event in geologic history. Approximately 85% of marine (sea-dwelling) species died. Only the End Permian mass extinction was larger. Unlike many smaller extinction events, however, the long-term consequences of the End Ordovician event were relatively small. Following the climatic oscillation, the climate returned to its previous state, and the species that survived soon (within two or three million years) evolved into species very similar to the ones that existed before.\n\nThe Hirnantian was named after Cwm Hirnant south of Bala, in northern Wales. Cwm Hirnant means the \"valley of the long stream\" in Welsh.\n\nThe stage was introduced in 1933 by B.B. Bancroft. As proposed by Bancroft, the Hirnantian included the Hirnant Limestone and related sedimentary formations. These formations were located at the very top of Ordovician deposits, and were dominated by a fauna which included brachiopods, trilobites, and other “shelly” or hard-coated animals. In 1966, D. A. Bassett, Harry Blackmore Whittington, and A. Williams, writing in the Journal of the Geological Society of London, proposed a refinement to the Hirnantian stage. This expanded the stage to include all of the Foel-y-Ddinas Mudstones, of which the Hirnant Limestone is a part. This expansion brought the Hirnantian stage to its current scope.\n\nThe International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) originally divided the Upper Ordovician into two stages. After considerable research, however, it was determined that no single faunal zone existed that could accommodate the upper stage of this division. Therefore, in 2003, the ICS voted to add an additional stage to its official international time scale. This was named the Hirnantian after Bancroft's stage. In 2006 the ICS ratified the Wangjiawan section as the official Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Hirnantian stage.\n\nThe GSSP of the Hirnantian is the Wangjiawan section () near the village Wangjiawan, 42 km north of Yichang (Hubei, China). It is an outcrop of the Wufeng and overlying Lungmachi Formation, the former containing the base of the Hirnantian. Both formations consist mainly of shale and chert. The base is defined as the first appearance datum of the graptolite species \"Normalograptus extraordinarius\" in that section.\n\nSecondary markers are \"Normalograptus ojsuensi\" 4 cm below the boundary, and the \"Hirnantia\" Fauna 39 cm above the boundary.\n\nAs mentioned above, there was a major climatic oscillation during the Hirnantian, which is believed to have caused a major mass extinction event. When the Hirnantian stage began, the Earth's climate was hot and sea-levels were substantially higher than today. The seas were filled with a diverse fauna. However, there is considerable evidence to indicate that many of these species were already in trouble when the Hirnantian began, and that overall biological diversity was already in sharp decline.\n\nAs the climate cooled and glaciers formed during the early part of the Hirnantian, sea level dropped. Estimates of the depth of this drop range from more than 50 meters (based on studies in Nevada and Utah) to more than 100 meters (from studies in Norway and the United Kingdom). More recent research indicates a worldwide reduction in sea level of approximately 80 meters. This drop dried up and exposed the extensive shallow-water continental shelves that existed throughout the world at that time, causing the extinction of large numbers of species who depended on this shallow water environment. Those species that survived were greatly reduced in numbers. The overall result was a major reduction in the biodiversity of the world's oceans.\n\nDuring this ice-house period (as scientists sometimes call periods of global cold weather and glaciation), surviving species began to adapt. Cold environment species replaced the warm environment species that had thrived during the previous hot period (hot-house to scientists).\n\nJust as the species were adapting, however, the climate changed again. During the latter part of the Hirnantian, temperatures rose, the glaciers melted, and sea level rose to the same or perhaps an even higher level than before the glaciation. The exposed shelves were flooded, resulting in additional extinctions among the fauna that had survived the first extinction event.\n\nWhile there are no major radiometric dates for the Hirnantian itself, there are two such dates which bracket the Hirnantian. Both dates are from the Dob's Linn area in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe older one comes from the local Hartfell shale formations. Zircon found in an ash deposit at the site was dated to 445.7 mya, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 million years.\n\nThe younger date is from the early Silurian Birkhill shale formations. Radiometric dating placed zircon samples found in another ash deposit at 438.7 mya, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.1 million years.\n\nWith these dates as a base, scientists were able to use biostratigraphic correlation techniques to determine close approximations for the timing of various events during the Hirnantian.\n\nThere are two Graptolite biozones in the Hirnantian and these are of approximately equal length. The base (beginning) of the Hirnantian stage is defined by the first appearance in the geologic record of the graptolite \"Normalograptus extraordinarius\", and thus, the Normalograptus extraordinarius biozone defines the early (or lower) part of the Hirnantian. The later (or upper) part is defined by the first appearance of the graptolite \"Normalograptus persulptus\", and the Normalograptus persulptus biozone lasts from then until the end of the Hirnantian. This also marks the end of the Ordovician period.\n\nThese biozones allow for additional refinement in dating events occurring within the Hirnantian stage.\n\nDuring the Hirnantian, much of the world's land mass was gathered into a supercontinent called Gondwana, which occupied extreme southern latitudes and covered the south pole. This included South America, Africa, most of Australia, the bulk of India, and Antarctica. What is now west Africa was then located at the pole, while South America was close by, joined to Africa along the latter's west coast. Along Africa's east coast were Antarctica and India, while Australia lay just to the north of them, straddling the equator. To the north of Australia was New Guinea. It may have been the northernmost point of land in the world, located just above 30 degrees north latitude. To the north of it lay a vast, uninterrupted sea, known today as the Panthalassic ocean.\n\nNot yet joined with what would become North America were Florida, southern Georgia, and the coastal areas of Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina wedged into a gap between Africa and South America, and located very near the South pole.\n\nThe rest of North America (called Laurentia by scientists) lay to the north and west of Gondwana, with relatively warmer climates. Rotated almost 45 degrees from their modern orientation, the eastern states of today's U.S. were located along the southeast coast of the continent, while the coastal areas of what are now the southeastern states faced south.\n\nTo the east of Laurentia, across a long, narrow sea, was Baltica. Composed of modern Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, northeastern Germany and Russia west of the Ural mountains, this area ranged from the equator in the north to more than 30 degrees south latitude.\n\nStretching westward from its southwest tip was an island arc known as Avalonia by modern scientists. This consisted of what is now the southern parts of Britain and Ireland, and eastern coastal regions of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and New England.\n\nThe Hirnantian now represents an internationally accepted stage with a carefully specified global beginning and ending. However, it started out in the nineteenth century as a regional stage in the United Kingdom, where it remains as such today. Since various regions of the world have their own local divisions of geologic time below the Period level, the following list provides correlations between those regional stages (or epochs in some cases) and the internationally recognized Hirnantian stage.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Macquarie Bank managed Moto between when Compass Group sold off SSP in April 2006 for £1,822 million and late 2015. As they have new owners and to keep up with their rivals, Moto is currently refurbishing sites with new restaurants.\n\nGranada, who owned the chain of Granada motorway service stations, merged with Compass in July 2000, to form Granada Compass plc. The plan was to combine the hospitality interests of the two businesses and hive off the media division, which was done by demerging the new group into Compass plc and Granada Media in 2001. Granada had previously acquired Forte plc in a £3.3bn hostile takeover on 24 January 1996. It sold its French \"Cote France\" service stations to Italy's Autogrill in December 1997. The food and hospitality division of Granada was retained by Compass, which became its Select Service Partner (SSP) UK division, but ownership of the Granada brand and trademark passed to the new media company. The Granada name was retained on the service stations until 23 May 2001, when the 47 sites were rebranded as Moto. In 2006, Moto separated from Compass Group and SSP following successful acquisition by a consortium of investors and underwent a period of intensive expansion through investment in new brands and offers.\n\nMoto operates various franchise outlets at Extra MSA locations.

Outdoor play areas used to be more common but have been removed for various reasons. Indoor play areas are currently (2017) at two service areas (Leigh Delamere Westbound and Donington). These were added in 2016.\n\nMoto won awards for the quality of their internal training programme \"Achieve In Moto\" (AIM) at the Training Journal Awards in 2017. Moto won Gold in the category \"Best Private/Commercial Programme\" and also two Silver awards in the categories \"Best Talent Development Programme\" and \"Best Operational Programme\".\n\nMoto have won awards for the standards of cleanliness in their public toilets, winning the 'Loo of the Year Award' in 2006 (for the fourth year running).\n\nThe competition judges visited more than 1,000 public toilets all over Britain, scrutinising cleanliness, overall management, signage, accessibility, décor and the standard of fixtures and fittings.\n\nIn 2008, Moto opened Britain's first carbon-neutral service station on the A1(M) at Kirk Deighton near Wetherby, lying across the border line between West Yorkshire and North Yorkshire; they also purchased Winchester Services from Roadchef for conversion to carbon neutral operation. The upgrade added recharging points for hybrid cars, a wind turbine, energy-saving measures within the station itself and several innovative solutions that were employed on a trial basis. These included a methane capturing system in the septic tank that allows gas to be recycled into the food production areas, and a commitment towards the reuse of energy currently wasted in the disposal systems of the station.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A third entry in the \"Earth\" series, it is a direct sequel to \"Earth 2150\". The release of the game was staggered, originally published in Russia, Germany, and Poland in June 2005, it was then released in the rest of Europe in September 2005 with North America receiving the latest release of the game November 2005. It was also released on Valve's Steam platform in April 2006, and later from Good Old Games in 2009. The game continues the dystopic themes of the previous \"Earth\" games, and is set in numerous locales throughout the solar system.\n\nIn \"Earth 2150\" the three factions of the United Civilised States (UCS), the Eurasian Dynasty (ED) and the Lunar Corporation (LC) raced to build starships and evacuate the Earth before it became uninhabitable. All three factions succeeded and sent ships to Mars, however, the UCS colony ship inexplicably disappeared en route. Both the ED and LC set about the difficult and lengthy task of terraforming Mars independently of one another, and also set up outposts on the outer planets and moons.\n\nIn \"Earth 2160\" the player initially takes the perspective of Major Michael Falkner of the ED forces. Falkner completes various missions for his (obviously unethical) ED superiors, largely against the LC, until he is sent to investigate a biological research operation that has gone silent. Upon reaching it an insectoid alien race is found, which then becomes the primary antagonist. At the end of the ED campaign, Falkner is betrayed by his superiors, who fear his idealism and imprisoned.\n\nThe game then shifts to the perspective of Commander Heldin Ariah, an LC commander who has gone rogue, and the player begins commanding LC units. The aliens are revealed to be the \"Morphidians\", and that the scientist who was studying them, Van Troff, has biologically altered himself to become their leader in an attempt to conquer the solar system. Ariah frees Falkner from imprisonment, and they discover the lost UCS colony ship the \"Phoenix\" and ally with its artificial intelligence.\n\nThe player then switches to controlling UCS units. The player discovers an interstellar gateway and explores another solar system with a habitable planet, \"Eden\". They discover the origin of the Morphidians - they were constructed by a race called \"The Builders\" as a bioweapon. After some time opposing the aliens, they ambush Falkner, capturing and subverting him.\n\nThe player then switches to the perspective of Falkner, biologically altered by Van Troff to serve him, commanding Morphidian units against his former allies. After several successes, Falkner is commanded to kill unarmed civilians, and he refuses, breaking Van Troff's control. Falkner turns his Morphidian units against Van Troff, and with the assistance of Ariah and the \"Phoenix's\" AI kills him and ends the threat to humanity.\n\nAn \"agent\" system allows factions to hire freelance persons each with their own specific abilities. Some assist scientific research, others in reconnaissance, resource harvesting and so forth. Each recalls his previous contracts, this affects price. Further, they have an attitude towards their fellow agents, ranging from love to resentment. Research plays a major part in Earth 2160, and factions can choose numerous technologies to research, often at the same time. Research centers are still prevalent, and the number constructed will have an effect on the speed of research. \"Earth 2160\" uses modular construction, in which buildings and units can be constructed from a wide assortment of basic parts. The game economy is based upon three material types: Water, Metal, and Crystals.\n\nA total of ten skirmish maps and four multiplayer modes exist. Players also have the option to save their multiplayer games to finish at a later date. The multiplayer servers are hosted from EarthNet, and a ladder and league is included. A maximum of eight players may join a game. Spectator mode and Replays are also included. There is also an option to join a running game, which many real-time strategy games don't have.\n\nDevelopment of EarthNet 2, which was meant to replace the old EarthNet after release, was stopped mid-2006. This caused enragement among the community as it was perceived that ZuxxeZ blamed the community for the failure of its development, as it was being developed with members of the community. In addition, ZuxxeZ considered the multiplayer feature of Earth 2160 unimportant, as only 10% of all users of Earth 2160 ever went online with it.\n\nEarth-4 is the graphics engine used in \"Earth 2160\". It is a 3D engine developed to make a highly detailed environment and AI. It also has a hardware version that supports pyrotechnic and lighting effects. It was developed by Mariusz Szaflik. Retrieved September 9, 2006</ref>\n\nThe game uses the Earth-4 engine, which uses a T&L rendering module supporting pixel shading and bone calculation direct to ones graphics card. Bump mapping, lighting effects and detailed units are also present.\n\nThe game uses an AI system which employs linear back framing algorithms to learn from its mistakes and become increasingly competent in battle as the game progresses.\n\nIn 2005 Zuxxez Entertainment hired law firm Schutt-Waetke to charge more than 18,000 German filesharers for copyright violation. Fines between 150 and 650 Euros were levied. The producer Dirk Hassinger had noticed there were far more players on the online game server than registered buyers (all the game's copy protection systems had been hacked and a small program was automatically generating serial numbers), leading him to start monitoring the filesharing networks for illegal shares. The Swiss firm Logistep offered him a package that would gather data valid for legal actions and automatically generate the charges ready for digital submission to the court in Karlsruhe. Two weeks later Hassinger's lawyer submitted one CD-ROM containing 13,700 charges to the court, each one also printed as a courtesy. By post each defendant received an offer: pay 50 Euros and the case would be dropped. Hassinger's lawyers also sent demands that each downloader sign an undertaking to never again share copyrighted software, plus an invoice for 200 to 500 Euros.\n\n"}

{"id": "2128950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2128950", "title": "Onsite sewage facility", "text": "Onsite sewage facility\n\nOnsite sewage facilities (OSSF), also called septic systems, are wastewater systems designed to treat and dispose of effluent on the same property that produces the wastewater, in areas not served by public sewage infrastructure. \n\nA septic tank and drainfield combination is a fairly common type of on-site sewage facility in the Western world. OSSFs account for approximately 25% of all domestic wastewater treatment in the US. Onsite sewage facilities may also be based on small-scale aerobic and biofilter units, membrane bioreactors or sequencing batch reactors. These can be thought of as scaled down versions of municipal sewage treatment plants, and are also known as \"package plants.\"\n\nThe primary mechanism of biological waste recycling in the natural environment is performed by other organisms such as animals, insects, soil microorganisms, plants, and fungi, which consume all available nutrients in the waste, leaving behind fully decomposed solids that become part of topsoil, and pure drinking water that has been stripped of everything that can possibly be consumed and utilized. This natural biological purification requires time and space to process wastes.\n\nIn virtually all engineered onsite sewage facilities, recycling and decomposition by natural organisms is still the primary mechanism of sewage disposal. Giving the organisms the time they need to decompose wastes is accomplished by establishing minimum sewage retention and settling times, and minimum liquid flow distances between sewage disposal sites and surface water or water wells.\n\nIt is normal for animals such as mice, rats, flies, and parasites to participate in the fully natural biological waste recycling process. Engineered facilities typically attempt to exclude them to prevent out of control population explosions and infestation, and prevent spread of vermin and disease.\n\nAlthough the solids collected by onsite sewage facilities can potentially be used as compost to build topsoil, these solids are often incompletely decomposed due to either a lack of onsite storage space to wait for decomposition (municipal facilities), or because the solids are being stacked in a layered structure of new waste solids on top of previously decomposed solids (septic tanks and outhouses). Due to the incomplete state of decomposition, when removed from an onsite sewage facility, these solids are typically referred to as \"sludge\" rather than \"compost\", and have powerful offensive odors arising from the microorganisms still consuming nutrients in the sludge. \n\nEngineered facilities that use water suspension to transport solids (private septic systems and municipal facilities) typically form a floating layer in their primary settling tank, consisting of low-density liquids such as oils, buoyant solids, and soap foam. This is referred to as \"scum\" and is slowly decomposed by microorganisms, eventually falling to the bottom of the settling tank as part of the sludge. When private septic tanks are emptied of solids, the tank is typically vacuumed empty and the incompletely digested scum is added to the incompletely digested sludge, further adding to its aroma and bioactivity.\n\nIf left completely undisturbed and exposed to the open air through a vent, the sludge and scum in a settling tank will eventually be turned completely into low-odor compost. By building two tanks side by side, and diverting sewage between them, one tank can be allowed to rest while the other is in use, and the resting tank can be safely and easily cleaned out by hand before it is used again. This has been proposed as a solution for onsite sewage facilities in subsistence agriculture economies where hand labor is the most abundant.\n\nAlthough human body waste is no different from the waste of any other animal, municipal facilities may be required to bury the collected solids in landfills, due to the risk of toxic contaminants placed into the shared communal sewage system, by humans unaware of the harm they are causing. Municipal facilities may also collect runoff from roadways, which contains traces of all the various chemicals used in vehicles such as brake fluid and engine oil, and those used in melting ice and snow. Private septic systems typically do not experience these issues, as the homeowner is directly aware that they must not pour toxic chemicals down the drain.\n\nMost onsite wastewater treatment systems are of the conventional type, consisting of a septic tank and a subsurface wastewater infiltration system (SWIS). Site limitations and more stringent performance requirements have led to significant improvements in the design of wastewater treatment systems and how they are managed. Over the past 20 years the onsite wastewater treatment system (OWTS) industry has developed many new treatment technologies that can achieve high performance levels on sites with size, soil, ground water, and landscape limitations that might preclude installing conventional systems. New technologies and improvements to existing technologies are based on defining the performance requirements of the system, characterizing wastewater flow and pollutant loads, evaluating site conditions, defining performance and design boundaries, and selecting a system design that addresses these factors.\n\nPerformance requirements can be expressed as numeric criteria (e.g., pollutant concentration or mass loading limits) or narrative criteria (e.g., no odors or visible sheen) and are based on the assimilative capacity of regional ground water or surface waters, water quality objectives, and public health goals. Wastewater flow and pollutant content help define system design and size and can be estimated by comparing the size and type of facility with measured effluent outputs from similar, existing facilities. Site evaluations integrate detailed analyses of regional hydrology, geology, and water resources with site specific characterization of soils, slopes, structures, property lines, and other site features to further define system design requirements and determine the physical placement of system components.\n\nMost of the alternative treatment technologies applied today treat wastes after they exit the septic tank; the tank retains settleable solids, grease, and oils and provides an environment for partial digestion of settled organic wastes. Post-tank treatment can include aerobic (with oxygen) or anaerobic (with no or low oxygen) biological treatment in suspended or fixed-film reactors, physical/chemical treatment, soil infiltration, fixed-media filtration, and/or disinfection. The application and sizing of treatment units based on these technologies are defined by performance requirements, wastewater characteristics, and site conditions.\n\nUnder Canadian federalism, environment is a shared power between federal and provincial governments. However, waste water management mostly falls within provincial, territorial and municipal jurisdiction, while the federal government has jurisdiction over wastewater on federal land and on First Nations reserves. Each province and territory has its own norms and regulations concerning the design and installation of onsite sewage facilities, such as whether a permit is required to do so and how to obtain it, the type, size and location of the system (usually according to on-site soil characteristics and other factors), etc. : \nThe potential market volume of on-site treatment is suggested to be about 35 million population equivalents for Europe.\n\nIn the United States, on site sewage facilities collect, treat, and release about of treated effluent per day from an estimated 26 million homes, businesses, and recreational facilities nationwide (U.S. Census Bureau, 1997). Recognition of the impacts of onsite systems on ground water and surface water quality (e.g., nitrate and bacteria contamination, nutrient inputs to surface waters) has increased interest in optimizing the systems' performance. Public health and environmental protection officials now acknowledge that onsite systems are not just temporary installations that will be replaced eventually by centralized sewage treatment services, but permanent approaches to treating wastewater for release and reuse in the environment. Onsite systems are recognized as viable, low-cost, long-term, decentralized approaches to wastewater treatment if they are planned, designed, installed, operated, and maintained properly (USEPA, 1997). NOTE: In addition to existing state and local oversight, decentralized wastewater treatment systems that serve more than 20 people might become subject to regulation under the USEPA's Underground Injection Control Program, although EPA has proposed not to include them (64FR22971:5/7/01).\n\nAlthough some onsite wastewater management programs have functioned successfully in the past, problems persist. Most current onsite regulatory programs focus on permitting and installation.\n\nFew programs address onsite system operation and maintenance, resulting in failures that lead to unnecessary costs and risks to public health and water resources. Moreover, the lack of coordination among agencies that oversee land use planning, zoning, development, water resource protection, public health initiatives, and onsite systems causes problems that could be prevented through a more cooperative approach. Effective management of onsite systems requires rigorous planning, design, installation, operation, maintenance, monitoring, and controls.\n\nState and tribal agencies report that onsite septic systems currently constitute the third most common source of groundwater pollution and that these systems have failed because of inappropriate siting or design or inadequate long-term maintenance (USEPA, 1996a). In the 1996 Clean Water Needs Survey (USEPA, 1996b), states and tribes also identified more than 500 communities as having failed septic systems that have caused public health problems. The discharge of partially treated sewage from malfunctioning onsite systems was identified as a principal or contributing source of degradation in 32 percent of all harvest-limited shellfish growing areas. Onsite wastewater treatment systems have also contributed to an overabundance of nutrients in ponds, lakes, and coastal estuaries, leading to the excessive growth of algae and other nuisance aquatic plants (USEPA, 1996b). In addition, onsite systems contribute to contamination of drinking water sources. USEPA estimates that 168,000 viral illnesses and 34,000 bacterial illnesses occur each year as a result of consumption of drinking water from systems that rely on improperly treated ground water. Malfunctioning septic systems have been identified as one potential source of ground water contamination (USEPA, 2000).\n\n"}

(also known as \"What time is it, Mr Wolf?\", \"Grandma's Footsteps\", \"1 2 3 Piano\" in Belgium and in the United States \"What time is it, Mr. Fox?\") is a form of tag played in Australia, Belgium, Canada, the United States, the English-speaking Caribbean, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.\n\nBecause it needs attention skills, quick reactions, and working memory for the 'it' child, it is recommended by Harvard University's Center on the Developing Child to assist in developing executive function skills for children aged 5 to 7.\n\nOne player is chosen to be Mr Wolf. Mr Wolf stands at the opposite end of the playing field from the other players, facing away from them. A call-and-response then takes place: all players except for Mr Wolf chant in unison \"What's the time, Mr Wolf?\", and Mr Wolf will answer in one of the two ways:\n\n\nIt is not uncommon for Mr Wolf to be allowed to look around at the other players, before answering the question; especially if there is a rule involving penalties applied to Mr Wolf if a player reaches him before \"Dinner time\" is called.\n\nThere is also a simpler version of the game where Mr Wolf faces the other players, who must remain stationary until \"Dinner time\" is called. If any player moves on a time of day being called, that player becomes Mr Wolf.\n\nIn another version, Mr Wolf holds a dandelion seed head and blows on it. The other players dance around him/her, taunting him \"What's the time, Mr Wolf?\" After each blow, Mr Wolf calls out \"1 o'clock\", \"2 o'clock\" etc. until all the seed head has been blown away. Then, he calls out \"Dinner time!\" and chases the other players to tag them before they can claim sanctuary at pre-designated points called \"Bar\". The players claim \"Bar\" by yelling out \"B - A - R Bar\" and touching the safety point. The skill is in deciding when the seed head is going to be completely blown away, as the players cannot run away until this happens. It could happen after one blow by Mr Wolf, or several. The first player tagged becomes Mr Wolf for the next round of the game. \n\nThis game can also be played on a hopscotch court. The players chant \"What's the time Mr Wolf\" and the wolf replies with a time. The players hop that number of spaces forwards on the hopscotch court. If Mr Wolf answers with \"It's dinner time\" the players try to run back to the beginning of the hopscotch court before they are caught by Mr Wolf.\n\nSimilar games include Lupo Delle Ore in Italy, and Captain Midnight in the United States, in which everyone has to start running at midnight. The game also bears some resemblance to Red light, green light and Dahrumasan ga koronda.\n\nAnother variant of this game which has become popular is \"Mr Shark, Mr Shark, what time is it?\" The big difference is that this game is played in a swimming pool, lake, or other swimming area. When Lunch Time is called the player may try running through the water or swimming to get away from the shark.\n\nA variant also exists in which the tagged players become wolves themselves, helping to tag the other players. The original wolf, however, still calls the numbers.\n\nThe variant played in the Low Countries, consists of one player at one end of the playfield with his back to the other players. He then calls out \"1 2 3 piano!\", whilst knocking three times on the wall in front of him. As he calls out, the other players are allowed to move towards him. Once the call is finished, the player quickly turns around. The other players then need to stand as still as possible. If the caller can spot someone moving, he can send that player back to the start. This is repeated until someone is able to tap the caller without being spotted.\n\n\n\n"}

An animated TV series began airing in Japan on April 2, 2012. In 1998, the manga received an Excellence Prize at the Japan Media Arts Festival. The TV series is on Netflix.\nBut then 3 years later, it got removed on Netflix since June 27, 2019\n\nGon's exact saurian species is never delved into. He vaguely resembles an outdated depiction of a generic carnosaur in a tripod stance, only about the size of a small dog. He is an omnivore with an enormous appetite. He possesses enormous power and endurance for his or any size, his feats of strength including supporting his own weight with his jaws, to being able to lift a fully grown African Elephant. His scaly hide is almost impenetrable, being able to shrug off the bites of larger predators.\n\nGon's intelligence seems to fluctuate in each adventure, ranging from total cluelessness (such as failing to notice a bird nest on his head for weeks), to strategic cunning (using a lion as a beast of burden to capture prey).\n\nIn \"Tekken 3\", Gon is fireproof, has the ability to spit fireballs and use toxic farts. He vocalizes in chirps and shrieks, reminiscent of raccoons and parrots.\n\nMasashi Tanaka (Gon's creator) has said, \"This work contains no dialog or onomatopoetic words. People always ask me why I have done this. From the beginning, I didn't think it was necessary. Manga should be without grammar. I also think that it is strange to give animals human language and make them talk. What I set out to do with \"Gon\" was to draw something that was more interesting than anything you could say in words. Manga still has great potential that does not exist in other media. I plan to continue developing the art of expression.\"\n\nGon's adventures are usually comedic with environmental connotations. There is very little continuity within the series, with Gon appearing in different countries and interacting with their respective fauna in almost every issue. He is often portrayed as being a short-tempered yet good-hearted creature, offering his help to the various animal friends he encounters in each issue.\n\nThe first English editions of the manga were published by Mandarin Publishing (UK, 1994) and Paradox Press (USA, 1996–2000). The single Mandarin volume contains the eight stories that were in the first two Japanese Gon collections. The eight Paradox Press volumes contain all the published Gon stories: six eight-page full-color stories in the Gon Color Spectacular, and twenty-one black-and-white stories, of varying length, in the other seven volumes.\n\nMandarin Publishing\n\nParadox Press\nThe first two Paradox Press books (\"Gon\" and \"Gon Again\") were later reissued in an omnibus volume:\nThe third and fourth Paradox Press books (\"Here Today, Gon Tomorrow\" and \"Going, Going...Gon\") were also reissued in an omnibus volume:\n\nFrom 2007 to 2009 CMX, a subset of DC Comics, reissued the black-and-white Gon stories in a seven-volume series. These did not have volume titles, but were simply numbered. Unlike the Paradox Press versions which were reversed for western readers, these stories are printed in the original sequence, and in their original right-to-left format. CMX had closed their doors in early 2010. Kodansha Comics reprinted the seven-volume series in 2011 and 2012.\n\nGon made his first video game appearance in the SNES platform game of the same name. The game was developed by Tose and released in Japan by Bandai on November 11, 1994. A new platformer, \"\", developed for the Nintendo 3DS and was released in Japan on June 14, 2012 by Namco Bandai Games.\n\nGon is a licensed character appearing in \"Tekken 3\", originally released for PlayStation consoles in April 1998, following the game's arcade debut on March 20, 1997. He is unlockable by defeating him in the \"Tekken Ball\" mode or by achieving a high score in Survival mode and inputting the name \"Gon\".\n\nSprite Animation Studios has announced that Moto Sakakibara, co-director of \"\", will direct a theatrical CG Animation based on the Gon manga. The movie was due for release in 2009 but has yet to materialise.\n\nA CG animated television series co-produced by Kodansha and Korean publisher Daewon Media aired in Japan from April 2, 2012 to March 25, 2013. It featured Motoko Kumai as the voice of Gon.\n\n\n\n"}

It broadcasts at 103.1 MHz. Its studios are located at the 257 Tower in Downtown Salt Lake City, and the transmitter site is atop Humpy Peak.\n\nPreviously known as Classic Alternative KJQ, the station flipped to Jack FM in January 2005.\n\nKSQN is licensed to Coalville, Utah, and KNJQ to Manti, Utah. KNJQ ceased to simulcast the station in late 2005 and went off-air shortly after a brief stint of running Simmons' KZNS 1280 sports-talk format. The station is now on-air as KUDD and simulcasting MillCreek-owned \"U92\" through a mutual agreement between the companies.\n\nKJQN began as a modern rock station from Ogden, Utah in 1983. At that time, the station broadcast on 95.5 FM and was also heard with a 1,000-watt simulcast from 1490 AM, which would later become KOGN.\n\nIn the late 1980s, KJQN was purchased by Abacus Communications, which fired much of the high-ranking staff in 1991. Fired program director Mike Summers, engineered a deal to take over another station, then-top 40 KZOL of Provo, Utah. Re-dubbed \"X96\" in February 1992, KXRK raided much of KJQ's talent. For a time the stations competed, but as KJQ's ratings eroded and modern rock promoters split their business, management decided to switch formats. In early October 1992 KJQN-FM switched formats to top 40, adopting the letters KKBE.\n\nIn 2001, Simmons purchased stations in Brigham City and Oakley, and acquired the historic call letters. The \"classic modern rock\" format adopted by Simmons was meant to evoke music played on the original KJQ. The morning show featured veterans of the original KJQ, \"Chet and Brad,\" and the station adopted some of the original KJQ's promotions including the old \"Bessie\" milk truck. Management went through several program directors including Ian McCain (from KCPX), Dom Casual (from KENZ and veteran of the original KJQ), Lara Jones (a veteran of the original KJQ), interim PD Todd Noker (also PD at sister station KXRK), Music Director Jon Smith (also from KENZ). \n\nOn January 21, 2005, the station flipped to the adult hits Jack FM format at noon, and the staff was laid off mid-shift without advanced notice. Management stated the audience \"wasn't growing as fast as we wanted.\"\n\nFrank Bell and Randy Rose programmed KJQN after the station flipped to Jack FM. \n\nOn June 29, 2012, it was announced that KJQN would drop the \"Jack FM\" format on July 16, 2012, and would begin to simulcast the talk radio format of KLO, and picked up the calls KLO-FM. The change took place at Midnight on that date; the last songs on Jack FM were \"Wild Wild Life\" by The Talking Heads and the first few seconds of \"Janie's Got a Gun\" by Aerosmith, which was abruptly cut off by the start of the simulcast.\n\nOn March 26, 2014, 103.1 changed callsigns to KSQN, sparking rumors of a format change in the following months. On June 5, 2014 KSQN dropped its simulcast with KLO and changed their format to adult contemporary, branded as \"Sunny 103.\"\n\nOn September 30, 2016, Capitol Broadcasting announced that KSQN would flip to 80s hits as \"103.1 The Wave\" the following Monday, October 3; promoting itself as \"The Next Wave of New Wave\", the format will lean towards alternative rock and new wave from the decade. The change took place at midnight on that date; the last song on Sunny was \"Roar\" by Katy Perry, and the first song on The Wave was \"Wake Up (It's 1984)\" by Oingo Boingo. The new format features many former Salt Lake City personalities including Cuzzin Brad in mornings and Chet ‘The Pinhead’ Tapp in middays.\n\n\n"}

In the 2018–2019 school year, Klein ISD had 53,328 students. Klein ISD is part of the taxation base for the Lone Star College System. , Jenny McGown is Superintendent of Schools.\n\nThe district has 32 elementary schools (including a Pre-K designated school), ten intermediate schools, and five high schools. A tenth intermediate school was opened in the Fall of 2018, and a 33rd elementary school will be built in the near future. For the 2018–2019 school year, the district received a score of 89 out of 100 from the Texas Education Agency.\n\nRural High School District No. 1 was formed in July 1928 as a result of the consolidation of five common school districts, including French School, the schools of Hildebrandt, Oak Grove, Willow Creek, Kothman, Harrel, Fuchs, and the Kohrville School for black children. The district became Klein Independent School District in 1938, named after Adam Klein, who led many German immigrants into the area in 1854. It is board policy that all high schools include the name 'Klein' in honor of the district's namesake. After Klein High School's current building was constructed in 1963, the original Klein High was used as the administration building. The current Klein ISD Central Office building opened in 1981.\n\nIn 1971, Donald Collins became the district's superintendent and served until his retirement in 2000. Under his tenure, the number of schools in the district rose from 6 to 28. In 2001, Klein Collins High School was named in his honor.\n\nJim Cain served as superintendent from 2004–2016. Formerly a director of school administration in Klein ISD before moving to Fort Bend ISD, Dr. Cain returned to Klein and worked as the assistant/associate superintendent for administration. In 2017, Klein Cain High School was named after him.\n\nKlein ISD serves unincorporated portions of northern Harris County, Texas, and includes the communities and neighborhoods of Klein, Kohrville, Louetta, and parts of North Houston. Some areas within the Spring and Tomball postal designations, and a portion of \"Acres Homes\" within the city limits of Houston are also served by Klein ISD.\n\nThe Klein ISD Board of Trustees passed a resolution at their January 2016 meeting regarding renaming the 88 square miles encompassing Klein ISD as Klein, Tx. The resolution includes the following: \nBy Texas legislative action in 1977, the area inside the boundaries of the Klein ISD was designated as Klein, Texas.\n\nFor each school year, the Texas Education Agency rates school district performance based on statistical data. Beginning in 2017–2018, the agency calculates a score for each district from 0 to 100 which is used to assign a grade from A to F. For the 2018-2019 school year, Klein ISD received an overall score of 89, resulting in a B grade. The district received a score of 85 and a B grade in 2017–2018.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2017, the agency rated school districts as either Met Standard, Met Alternative Standard, or Improvement Required. Klein ISD received a Met Standard rating for each year under this system. School districts did not receive a rating for the 2011–2012 school year as the agency transitioned from using the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) to the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) as the basis for their accountability ratings.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2011, the agency rated school districts as either Exemplary, Recognized, Academically Acceptable, or Academically Unacceptable. From 2004 to 2008, the district was rated Academically Acceptable, and from 2009 to 2011, the district received a Recognized rating. School districts did not receive a rating for the 2002–2003 school year as the agency transitioned from using the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) to the TAKS standardized test.

The district had 3,518.66 teachers and 3,528.16 additional staff for a total of 7,046.82 employees on a full-time equivalent basis. The district's student to teacher ratio was 15.16. The ethnic distribution of students was:\n\n45.2% of students were listed as economically disadvantaged, 15.4% were English-language learners, and 9.6% received special education services.\n\nKlein ISD's student enrollment has increased significantly across multiple decades. In the 2017–2018 school year, there were 52,896 students enrolled. There were 44,695 students in 2009–2010, and 35,474 students in 2003–2004.\n\nKlein ISD, with voter approval, has sold bonds in 2004, 2008, and 2015 to provide funding for large infrastructure projects. The 2004 bond referendum approved the sale of $224 million and included renovations of existing buildings and the construction of Vistas High School and Benignus Elementary School. All projects associated with the 2004 bond started in 2005 and have been completed. On May 10, 2008, a bond referendum for $646.9 million was passed with approximately 52% (4,732 of 9,152) of the ballots for it. The bond was to create new schools, including Blackshear Elementary, Bernshausen Elementary, and Klein Cain High School.\n\n"}

On the rest of this coast, that access is prevented by the height of the chalk cliffs.\n\nThere are three sorts:\n\nThe word is peculiar to the Pays de Caux but the feature is not, though it shows itself particularly well here. The valleys developed while the water table was much higher in the chalk than it now is so that a stream flowed in each of these truncated valleys. It is likely that most of the formation of the valleys in the plateau occurred during cold periods. This region was never covered by an ice cap but it has been only about 230 kilometres from one. In those circumstances, the conditions will have been tundra, sometimes verging on periglacial. When the frozen ground thawed in the spring, the surface soil was very wet because the melted snow and ground water could not sink into the permafrost. Any appreciable slope on the surface will have induced slumping and erosion but we have a plateau so the slopes were not originally great.\n\nDuring the glacial periods, the sea level was low enough to have emptied the English Channel to the north of the Pays de Caux. The truncated valleys in the chalk, represent the headwaters of streams flowing down to what is now the bottom of the sea. During the interglacials the sea eroded the coast and steepened the slope down which they flowed but they will have required ever wetter conditions to keep the water table in the chalk sufficiently high to make the streams flow.

{"id": "2129169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2129169", "title": "Chaos Legion", "text": "Chaos Legion\n\nThe story of \"Chaos Legion\" is a gothic opera which begins November, 791 A.S. (\"Anno Satanis\"):\nthe protagonist, Sieg Wahrheit, is a Knight of the Dark Glyphs who is on a quest under command of the Order of St. Overia to find his former friend, Victor Delacroix, who has stolen the forbidden book \"Apocrypha of Yzarc\", and to stop him from releasing the evil spirit Azrail, who would destroy the three planes of existence: the Nether World, the Middle World, and the Celestial World.\n\nThe gameplay is primarily action-oriented. Numerous enemies attack the player in waves, and progress to the next part of the stage often requires defeat of all enemies in the area. The main feature that lends originality to the game is the addition of the \"Chaos Legion\", which are supernatural creatures that fight alongside the player. While legions are summoned, Sieg Wahrheit (the player character) is unable to run and has weaker melee attacks. Legions can be controlled to a degree: their tactics can be switched between offensive and defensive, and players can issue orders for them to attack immediately. While the legions are inactive, Sieg can perform a sort of special attack called an Assist Attack which causes a legion to appear and attack with him.\n\nIn game, it is possible to increase the power of the legions at Sieg's command using experience gained in battle.\nThere are 4 main areas for increasing a legion's power, namely :\n\nIn the beginning of the plot, Victor feels that Sieg was responsible for the death of his lover—and Sieg's friend—Siela Riviere, three years ago (prior to the events in the story which take place in the mentioned time); and has the intent on bringing Sieg into a pure pandemonium that Victor himself has prepared as retribution, not only for the sins of Sieg alone, but for the sins of the whole world —referring to this Armageddon as the “Purification of the World”: whereupon he plans to use relentless hordes of hideous monsters to cleanse the world of sinners by obtaining the \"Three Sacred Glyphs\" and releasing Azrail.\n\nDuring his quest, Sieg encounters a member of the \"Maidens of the Silver\" fighting a monster alone after other Maidens are killed. With Sieg's help, Arcia Rinslet, the sole survivor, manages to escape death. At first, Arcia mentions that the Maidens were in tough pursuit of Victor; thus, when she learns that Sieg is also searching for the same person, she decides to tag along. Later, it is revealed that Arcia has held a grudge against Victor for the murder of her brother. Sieg never tells Arcia why he pursues Victor, even though he does say the two knew each other from before. Because of this lack of trust, Arcia briefly loses her faith in Sieg and sets off to find Victor alone. Sieg eventually catches up and subsequently teams up with her once more after he consoles her.\n\nSieg and Arcia meet Victor several times: each time to have a little more of Victor's plan revealed, but unable to stop him from obtaining the Three Sacred Glyphs. Soon, Sieg and Arcia finally meet Victor in the “Hall of Chaos”, the place where Azrail has been sealed. Victor decides to “punish” Sieg first: by killing Arcia—forcing her to do it with her own gun after gaining control of her body—since it seems that she is close to Sieg. The murder fails, unbeknownst to Sieg, who lashes out and attacks Victor because he believes Arcia to be dead. After subduing Victor, Sieg learns that Arcia survived the shot, only to find that Victor has not been fully defeated.\n\nSurrounded in black aura, Victor attacks Sieg once again, but Arcia steps in between Sieg and Victor with her arms outstretched. \nInstead of killing her, Victor stops abruptly and regains control; a flashback then reveals the truth of the past: Three years before, Sieg, Victor and Siela were instructed by the Order to reseal the demon Azrail—discovering that the Order actually planned to use Azrail's power for world dominance, but realized that it was too powerful to contain. The demon resisted and decided that, instead of being banished once more, it would possess a human: Siela; Victor tried to protect Siela, but was possessed instead. In his uncontrollable rampage, he almost killed Sieg, but Siela stopped the final blow, and Victor drove his sword straight through, piercing her chest. When he came back to his senses, he believed Sieg had committed the murder. Siela's dying words to Sieg, beforehand, were “Take care of Delacroix…”—this being the reason why Sieg can't directly kill his friend.\n\nBack in the present time, Victor decides to end his own life, much to Sieg's dismay—the only way to break Azrail's seal is to kill the person who last created the seal or perform a secret ritual sacrifice described in the forbidden book, the Apocrypha of Yzarc. Victor breaks the seal by sacrificing himself. Azrail is then released and fights Sieg, not only in its own diabolical form, but also re-spawned in the figure of a darkened, corrupted Siela to intimidate him. However, Sieg prevails.\n\nAfter all the chaos, Sieg mounts a tribute to Victor and Siela, and mourns over the loss of his two best friends, but Arcia cheers him up.\n\n\nSieg has the power to handle the Chaos Legion. The Legion is composed by seven legions, each one with their own abilities and characteristics:\n\n\nThe music and soundtrack of Chaos Legion is composed by Hideyuki Fukasawa.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version received \"mixed\" reviews, while the PC version received \"unfavorable\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave the PS2 version a score of 30 out of 40. Many game magazines gave the same console version average to positive reviews months before its U.S. release. AllGame gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five and said that it \"starts out promising and gradually becomes more tedious the further you delve into it. It's repetitive, and it's repetitive not because of the sheer number of enemies thrown at you or the simplistic nature of objectives, but because of the paltry set of moves you can initiate with the main character.\" \"Edge\" gave it six out of ten and said that it \"tests neither the reactions nor the brain enough to hold your interest.\"\n\n"}

He was known best as Silver King, but also had an extensive stint as the third wrestler to portray the Black Tiger character. He was the son of luchador Dr. Wagner and the brother of Dr. Wagner Jr. González worked for many years with El Texano as the tag team \"Los Cowboys,\" winning tag team championships in both Mexico and Japan.\n\nGonzález worked for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA), Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) and various smaller federations all over the world. González also starred as the villain \"Ramses\" in the movie \"Nacho Libre\", starring Jack Black. In June 2010, González began using the ring name Silver Cain/Silver Kain when wrestling in Mexico City as a way to be able to officially be allowed to wear his mask again.\n\nIn 2019, he was posthumously inducted into the AAA Hall of Fame.\n\nCésar Cuauhtémoc González Barrón was born on 9 January 1968, son of Magdalena Barrón and her husband Manuel González Rivera, better known as the \"luchador\" (professional wrestler) Dr. Wagner. César González was the third son born to Manuel, with his brother Óscar being four years his elder, and Juan Manuel González Barrón, two years older than César, and finally a daughter Mayra. At one point in the late 1980s to 1990s César González was married to Xóchitl Guadalupe Hamada Villarreal, who is also a professional wrestler under the name Xóchitl Hamada.\n\nIn 2012, César González introduced a wrestler under the name \"Silver King Jr.\", a masked wrestler who was advertised as the son of González, but would later reveal that the first person to use the name Silver King Jr. was not his son, disassociating himself from the \"fake\" son. A second wrestler used the name Silver King Jr. in 2014 and 2015 until he was unmasked in a match on 11 October 2015, where he gave the name Felipe Garcia González. César González later introduced \"El Hijo de Silver King\" (\"The Son of Silver King\"), believed to be his real son, not a storyline. César González was the uncle of El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr. and El Galeno del Mal, sons of his older brother Juan Manuel, as well as the former brother-in-law of Rossy Moreno and the Moreno wrestling family until Juan Manuel and Moreno divorced.\n\nBoth César González and his brother Juan Manuel began wrestling at an early age. César made his debut in November 1985 and initially used the name El Invasor (Spanish for \"the Invader\"). Within a year of his debut, he changed his name and started working as the Luchador Emmascadero (masked wrestler) Silver King. Silver King started working for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) in the lower matches on the cards. On 12 November 1987, Silver King wrestled in a Lucha de Apuestas (a \"Bet\" Match) where he put his mask on the line against El Hijo del Santo's mask. When Silver King lost he was forced to unmask and in lucha tradition reveal his true name, it was here that it was first revealed that Silver King was one of Dr. Wagner's sons.\n\nShortly after being unmasked Silver King formed a team with El Texano that would become known as \"The Cowboys\"/\"Los Cowboys\". In 1991 the team won their first tag team championship winning a tournament to become the first ever World Wrestling Association World Tag Team Champions. On 19 January 1992, they added the UWA World Tag Team Championship to their collection when they defeated Gran Hamada and Kendo for the title in Japan and brought the titles back to Mexico. Their run with the UWA World Tag Team titles saw them work a storyline with the Can-Am Express (initially masked and just designated \"I\" and \"II\" but later revealed to be Doug Furnas and Dan Kroffat). The storyline saw Los Cowboys lose the UWA World Tag Team title on 28 June 1992, but gain a measure of revenge less than a month later when Los Cowboys beat the Can-Am Express in a \"Lucha de Apuestas\" match and forced Furnas and Kroffat to unmask and reveal their true identities. During their time as double champions, Los Cowboys were invited to participante in a tournament to crown new National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) World Tag Team Champions hosted by World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The team competed at Clash of the Champions XIX and lost in a first-round match to The Fabulous Freebirds.\n\nOn 7 July 1993, Los Cowboys lost the WWA World Tag team titles to El Dandy and Corazon de Leon but regained them two months later. Their second run with the WWA World Tag Team title only lasted a month as Villano IV and Villano V took the title from them on 10 October 1993. On 31 October, only 21 days after losing the tag team titles Silver King won his first singles title when he defeated his partner El Texano for the UWA World Light Heavyweight Championship. Despite having defeated his own partner Los Cowboys did not turn on each other but kept on working together. In early 1994 Los Cowboys ended their relationship with the UWA and began working for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). Silver King defeated Black Magic for the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship on 28 July 1994. Not content to work in the singles' division Los Cowboys won the CMLL World Tag Team Championship (while Silver King still held the singles world title) on 16 December 1994, by unseating long time champions El Canek and Silver King's brothers Dr. Wagner Jr. As if being a double champion was not enough Silver King teamed up with Shocker to win the 1995 Gran Alternativa tournament.\n\nDuring 1995 Los Cowboys began working for the Japanese-based International Wrestling Association of Japan where they won the IWA World Tag Team Championship from Los Headhunters on 3 March 1995, in Hiroshima, Japan. The duo lost the tag team title on 20 August the same year on the undercard of the IWA's \"King of Deathmatches\" show. Silver King would also lose the CMLL World title and the tag team title in 1995 being defeated by Apolo Dantés and the team of Los Headhunters respectively. In February 1996 he teamed up with his brother and defeated Dos Caras and Último Dragón to win the vacant CMLL World Tag Team Championship. When WCW started signing Luchadors in 1997, Silver King joined the North American promotion and vacated the title that he and his brother still held at the time.\n\nSilver King joined World Championship Wrestling in 1997 as one of the many Luchadors that worked for the company in that time period. He mostly found himself usually working six-man matches on \"WCW Monday Nitro\", teaming with Psicosis and La Parka or Villano IV and Villano V. During his time in WCW Silver King only made five pay-per-view appearances. Twice he participated in a Three Ring, 60-man battle royal at World War 3 1997 and World War 3 1998. He also participated in a Junkyard Invitational at Bash at the Beach 1999 but with no success. His highest-profile match was an unsuccessful challenge for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship against Juventud Guerrera at Fall Brawl 1998. When Eddie Guerrero formed the Latino World Order Silver King was one of the Luchadors that joined the group but never rose above his lower mid-card status. It was not until 2000 when Stacy Keibler announced that she started managing the team of Silver King and El Dandy, known as Los Fabulosos, that it looked like Silver King was going to move up the rankings. Silver King was released from WCW in late 2000.\n\nAfter leaving WCW, he returned to CMLL and began wrestling for CMLL's Japanese affiliate, New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW). In 2001, he adopted the Black Tiger character, previously used by Mark Rocco and Eddie Guerrero, making him the third person to appear under the mask, which is why he's unofficially referred to as Black Tiger III in printed sources. As Black Tiger, he wrestled several tours with New Japan starting out working a series of matches with the storyline opponent of the Black Tiger, Tiger Mask – in this case, Tiger Mask IV. Together with his brother Dr. Wagner Jr., he had an unsuccessful IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship challenge against the team of Jushin Thunder Liger and El Samurai in 2001.\n\nDuring 2003 NJPW began to phase out most of the Luchadors they had employed over the years and thus Black Tiger began working regularly in Mexico for CMLL, this marked the first time the gimmick was used for a longer period of time outside of NJPW. Since the storyline in Mexico was that Black Tiger was Japanese they could not acknowledge the fact that he and Dr. Wagner Jr. were brothers (in Japan Black Tiger had always been portrayed by a foreigner). He usually ended up as Dr. Wagner Jr.'s back-up but on 31 March 2001, Black Tiger, Dr. Wagner Jr., and Universo 2000 won the CMLL World Trios Championship from Atlantis, Black Warrior, and Mr. Niebla. The team would hold the Trios title for over a year until being unseated on 9 July 2004, by Black Warrior, El Canek, and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. When their father (Dr. Wagner) died on 12 September 2004, Dr. Wagner Jr. was turned \"tecnicó\" (good guy) by sympathy but since González was working as Black Tiger and not publicly acknowledged as the son of Dr. Wagner he remained a \"rudó\" (bad guy). Dr. Wagner Jr.'s turn meant that Black Tiger did not have a partner or a direction, he began working for CMLL's associate International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) and some smaller CMLL shows, basically in a holding pattern.\n\nGonzález kept working as Black Tiger even when NJPW introduced Rocky Romero as the latest Black Tiger (Black Tiger IV) but due to their working relationship with NJPW, CMLL decided that when González worked for them he needed a different \"persona\". He was repackaged as \"El Bronco\" complete with a new mask and promoted as someone new to CMLL. González made his debut as \"El Bronco\" teaming up with Elektro (who had just jumped from AAA to CMLL) and L.A. Park against the original members of Los Guerreros del Infierno (Último Guerrero, Rey Bucanero, and Tarzan Boy). The match was seen as a letdown as the crowd did not appreciate Elektro and did not buy into the \"El Bronco\" gimmick and the scheduled rematch was rebooked with Hijo de Lizmark and Místico taking over their roles in the match and González as El Bronco replacing Lizmark Jr. in the 2005 Gran Alternativa tournament where his team lost in the first round. After the Gran Alternativa González only made sporadic CMLL appearances as González. González continued wrestling as Black Tiger in IWRG and in other independent Mexican wrestling promotions. On 4 February 2006, González finally gave up the Black Tiger name as he lost a \"Lucha de Apuestas\" to L.A. Park and was unmasked. After losing his mask González went back to working as Silver King.\n\nIn late 2007, Silver King started working for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) where he became masked once again. In a break from tradition. Silver King did not change gimmicks but remasked under the same gimmick he was unmasked as in 1987. Silver King won the World Junior Heavyweight Championship on 1 March 2007, by defeating Katsuhiko Nakajima. He held the title for under two months as he lost it to Ryuji Hijikata on 29 April 2007.\n\nOn 13 June 2008, Silver King made his debut with AAA, teaming with La Parka (AAA) and Chessman to face La Legion Extranjera (Electro Shock, Bobby Lashley, and Kenzo Suzuki) at AAA's Triplemania XVI show. Silver King participated in the second annual \"Copa Antonio Peña\" tournament Gauntlet match. He was the eleventh entrant and lost to eventual winner El Mesias. During a television taping on 7 February 2009, Silver King turned on his tag team partners La Parka (AAA) and X-Pac to side with Konnan's La Legión Extranjera.\n\nAfter \"La Legión Extranjera\" was defeated in the main event of Triplemania XVII and Konnan lost control of AAA, Silver King went on to form the stable \"Los Wagnermaniacos\" with Dr. Wagner Jr., Electroshock, and Ultimo Gladiator. Following Electroshock's AAA Mega Championship win at Rey de Reyes in March 2010, Silver King, Electroshock, and Ultimo Gladiator all turned on Dr. Wagner Jr. and adopted the new stable name \"Los Maniacos\". In the weeks leading up to Triplemania XVIII, it was announced that the winners of a tag team match between Silver King and Último Gladiador against \"La Hermandad 187\" (Nicho and Joe Líder) would be given a chance to wrestle for the AAA World Tag Team Championship at Triplemania XVIII. The match between the two teams ended in a draw, leaving it undecided if both or neither teams will wrestle at Triplemania XVIII.\n\nOn 6 June 2010, at Triplemania XVIII, Silver King was officially billed as \"Silver Cain\", both as a reference to the biblical Cain and Abel, as well as a way for AAA to get around him wearing a mask again. The Mexican Boxing and Wrestling Commission had been giving González problems due to the fact that he had previously lost his mask and this was a way to get around it since he was allowed to wear a mask under a new character. He would only have to use the new name when wrestling in Mexico City. On that night he and Último Gladiador outlasted three other teams, pinning James Storm of Beer Money, Inc. to win the AAA World Tag Team Championship, Silver King's first AAA title. Following the match, \"Los Junior Capos\" (Máscara Año 2000 Jr. and Hijo de Cien Caras) from IWRG came to the ring to challenge the new champions for the title. On 26 June, Silver King defeated Máscara Año 2000 Jr. to win the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship in an AAA/IWRG inter-promotional match.\n\nSilver King went on to challenge Dr. Wagner Jr. for the AAA Mega Championship in a three-way match, which also included Vampiro, on 15 August at Verano de Escandalo, but failed to win the title, when Wagner pinned Vampiro. After the match King played an audiotape, where the late father of the two brothers claimed that King was the more talented of the two of them. This revelation led to a match on 1 October at Héroes Inmortales IV, where Wagner Jr. defeated Silver King in a singles match to retain the AAA Mega Championship.\n\nIn September 2010 Silver King and Último Gladiador had announced they were joining \"La Sociedad\". Initially, Electroshock made no official announcement on whether he would be following them but agreed to represent the group at \"Héroes Inmortales V\" in order to get his hands on Heavy Metal, with whom he had been feuding the past weeks. However, on 14 November he announced he was not part of \"La Sociedad\" and urged Silver King and Último Gladiador to leave the group. After Electroshock turned \"La Sociedad\" down for the second time on 18 November, Silver King and Último Gladiador turned on him and beat him down with \"La Milicia\". On 27 November Silver King officially kicked Electroshock out of \"Los Maniacos\", while also announcing his spot in the group would be taken by a new member.\nOn 5 December at \"Guerra de Titanes\" Silver King and Último Gladiador successfully defended the AAA World Tag Team Championship in a three–way ladder match against \"La Hermandad 187\" and fellow \"La Sociedad\" members Hernandez and El Ilegal. On 21 March 2011, \"Los Maniacos\" lost the AAA World Tag Team Championship to Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans. In IWRG, \"Los Maniacos\" was joined by Joe Líder, with whom Silver King and Último Gladiador held the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship from 3 March to 24 April when they lost them during IWRG's \"Guerra de Empresas\" show. After losing the title to \"Los Psycho Circus\", King and Gladiador turned on Líder and kicked him out of the group. Shortly thereafter, King and Gladiador joined forces with Chessman to form \"La Maniarquía\". On 18 June at Triplemanía XIX, \"La Maniarquía\" was defeated by Electroshock, Heavy Metal and Joe Líder in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match. In April 2012, Silver King made peace with Dr. Wagner Jr. as the two came together to battle \"El Consejo\" stable. However, the alliance was short-lived as on 5 August during the main event of \"Triplemanía XX\", Silver King turned on Wagner Jr., who, despite the betrayal, managed to defeat Máscara Año 2000 Jr. in a Mask vs. Mask match. Afterward, Silver King revealed that he had been behind \"El Consejo\" from the beginning, revealing himself as the leader of the \"rudo\" stable. However, Silver King quickly began having problems with his new stablemates, with Máscara Año 2000 Jr. asking how they could trust a man who was capable of betraying his own brother. The storyline was dropped after both Máscara Año 2000 Jr. and Toscano left \"El Consejo\". On 8 December 2013, at \"Guerra de Titanes\", Silver King, El Texano Jr., and \"El Consejo\"'s newest member, El Hijo del Fantasma, unsuccessfully challenged \"Los Psycho Circus\" for the AAA World Trios Championship.\n\nIn 2005, González was cast as the villain opposite Jack Black's character in the Paramount Pictures film \"Nacho Libre\". In the film, González wears a golden mask and outfit and plays the top luchador known as \"Ramses\". After the film premiered, González wore the golden outfit at least once during a defense of his UWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship.\n\nDuring a match in Camden Town, London, England, against Juventud Guerrera on 11 May 2019, González collapsed in the ring and died a short time later, from a heart attack at the age of 51. Following his death, his body was delayed in being transported from London to Mexico. His body arrived in Mexico City on 19 May. and being there it was moved to Monterrey and later by land to Torreón, Coahuila his native city, there his funeral was held at the Funeraria Gayosso where fans were able to attend, and he was later buried at the panteón Jardines del Tiempo in Torreón alongside his father. An autopsy confirmed that González 's cause of death was due to a fulminant Myocardial infarction and that there were no drugs or medications in his blood.\n\nAfter his death, it was reported Daniel \"El Satanico\" Lopez, who runs the commission in Zapopan in Guadalajara, decided that shows held in that state need two ambulances on-site, one paramedic, one doctor, and the referees have to know CPR.\n\nOn 22 May, 2019 a tribute in memory for González was held at the Arena Campeones de Torreón. On 3 August at Triplemanía XXVII, he was posthumously inducted into the AAA Hall of Fame as part of the 2019 class.\n\n\n\n"}

Students desiring to attend a community college in Illinois have a lower tuition rate if they attend the community college for the district in which they live. Prior to 1991, the entire state of Illinois was covered by community college districts except a portion of central Illinois centered on Bloomington. Students living in this non-districted area were in the unique situation of being allowed the choice of attending any of the surrounding four districts' community colleges.\n\nThis situation changed in 1990 when Heartland Community College was established, with its first \"campus\" located in the Landmark Mall in the city of Normal, and a second location opened in Bloomington's Towanda Plaza in 1992. The college moved to its current campus in north Normal in 2000, and closed the last building in the strip mall in 2007.\n\nHeartland's first president was Jonathan Astroth, who served from 1991 to 2010. He was succeeded by Allen Goben and, later, Rob Widmer. Upon Widmer's retirement in 2018, Dr. Keith Cornille assumed the mantle.\n\nHeartland Community College consists currently of seven buildings on the main campus in Normal. Three of the original buildings are connected by walkways on the second floor that cross over Community College Drive. The other four buildings were additions after the initial permanent campus was opened in 2000.\n\nApproaching the campus from the east, the first of the buildings is the CCB, or Community Commons Building. This building is where new students may register for classes, speak to an Academic Advisor, access their student records, and receive other information. This building also houses the Financial Aid department and the Human Resources department. Directly connected to this building by way of the walkway on the second floor is the SCB, or Student Commons Building.\n\nThe SCB houses the Campus Café, student bookstore, library, security desk, and IT department. The SCB is also home to Project Rise, Heartland's Student Support Services Trio program. The SCB is aligned perpendicular to the CCB and the third main building, the ICB, or Instructional Commons Building.\n\nThe ICB is connected to the north end of the SCB's second floor by a walkway, and is actually twice as long from end to end as either the SCB or CCB, and has an open meeting area in the middle of its length on the first floor. It houses department offices. This is also home to many classrooms.\n\nICN, or Instructional Commons North, sits between the ICB and the WDC and houses mostly classrooms and a few departmental offices.\n\nWDC, or Workforce Development Center, was the first new addition to the permanent campus. This building was erected in 2007 at the north end of the campus grounds, and opened for classes that fall. It is intended to be a \"green\" building, with heating and cooling being provided by geothermal energy and other eco-friendly technology. Standing over three stories tall, including the fourth floor maintenance area, it is the tallest building on campus, and is where the vast majority of technology-focused classes are held.\n\nThe Astroth Community Education Building, or ACEC, houses many meeting rooms, a campus auditorium seating more than 400, and the Challenger Learning Center (CLC. The Challenger Learning Center is one of several such centers located around the world that use space exploration as a way to teach students valuable STEM skills. The CLC can also be used for team-building.\n\nThe Fitness and Recreation Center (FRC) houses an aerobics studio, a gymnasium, a walking/jogging track, locker rooms with showers and towel service and a training room. There are also several classrooms in the building as well as the office for the athletic department.\n\nThe Child Development Lab (CDL) is a lab school for children ages six weeks to five years and a facility that provides opportunities for early childhood students needing first-hand experience working with young children.\n\nHeartland's sports teams are known as the Hawks. The Hawks compete in soccer (men's and women's), baseball, and softball. The Hawks joined the Mid-West Athletic Conference (MWAC) as part of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA).\n\nStudents at Heartland Community College can take part in different Clubs and Organizations on Campus.

Admission is free.\n\nSECCA has been accredited by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM) since 1979, one of only 300 museums in the United States to earn this distinction.\n\nSECCA was founded in 1956 as the Winston-Salem Gallery of Fine Arts in Old Salem. James Gordon Hanes of the locally prominent Hanes family, who died in 1972, bequeathed his Norman Revival home built in 1929 and grounds to the gallery. The home was augmented with purpose-built exhibition space, and SECCA moved to the new location in 1977 under its current name.

It is made in grapefruit, orange (yellow), lemon (greenish-yellow), bitter (herbal extracts), and apple flavors. Kasfruit juices are also offered in multiple flavors. Kas is available in Spain, Mexico and France, and was available in Portugal, Brazil and Argentina during the 1990s.\n\nIt is part of a beverage area often referred to as the flavor segment, fruit-flavored beverages which may be carbonated.\n\nKas was introduced by Roman Knörr Streiff in 1956 in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Araba, the capital of the Basque Country, as a local brand used primarily as a mixing drink with alcoholic beverages. The brand grew, was acquired by Pepsi-Cola de España in 1991, and was extended into diet soft drinks and juices. \n\nKas promotion has included a landmark 24 Horas Kas campaign in the mid-1990s that included a catchy jingle based on the song \"Dame Mas\" (Give Me More) by Alex de la Nuez a cover of the Steve Miller Band's song \"Give It Up\" from 1982 album \"Abracadabra\". The campaign featured the Chica Kas, an attractive woman wearing a broad-brimmed hat and slinky dress, in situations involving cultural taboos and with sexual overtones. \n\nFaced with Coca-Cola's competitive launch of grapefruit-flavored Fresca in 1994, \"Pepsi-Cola de Mexico\" launched Kas grapefruit into the Mexican market. The Spanish 24 Horas Kas campaign was adapted to the Mexican market for launch, and the Dame Mas song interpreted by the Argentine pop group The Sacados from their album \"Alter Nativo\" heavily promoted, eventually charting high in the Mexican music market. The launch also included extensive television commercials, radio commercials, billboards and a tasting campaign in bars and clubs to promote Kas as a mixer with tequila. In 2006 the brand was renamed as Kas Mas.\n\nIn France, Kas became popular in the southwestern part of the country, where it is often mixed with gin or vodka.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, in order to succeed in the Brazilian market, where there are several soft drink brands on the market made from guarana extract, Kas was introduced in several guarana-derived flavours, which included guarana by itself or with acerola, maracuja, and peach. Production ended shortly after launch, and the orange, lemon, and apple flavours were never available in Brazil.\n"}

Despite its name and the presence of a nearby man-made lake, Pixar Pier is not actually a pier, but a waterside area of the park. Incredicoaster sprawls across much of the area, with various other attractions and forms of entertainment scattered around it.\n\nThe area opened as Paradise Pier in 2001 along with the rest of the theme park. A new attraction, Toy Story Midway Mania!, opened on June 17, 2008. The attraction was the first in a series of theming upgrades to the land and park as a whole. This was followed by changes to the Sun Wheel to become Mickey's Fun Wheel, removing the ears of the Mickey head behind California Screamin’s vertical loop, and new Games of the Boardwalk in 2009. In 2010, World of Color and Silly Symphony Swings were added. To complete the Paradise Pier makeover, Disney opened Goofy's Sky School and .\n\nPart of Paradise Pier was reimagined as Pixar Pier, which opened on June 23, 2018. The area that includes Paradise Gardens, Goofy’s Sky School, Silly Symphony Swings, Jumpin' Jellyfish, Golden Zephyr, and The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure was renamed Paradise Gardens Park.\n\nWhen the park first opened in 2001, Paradise Pier originally resembled a modern seaside amusement park, similar to that of the Santa Monica Pier, or Santa Cruz Boardwalk. As part of the Disney California Adventure $1.1 billion expansion project, Paradise Pier was re-themed to evoke the charm of Victorian era seaside amusement parks of the 1920s.\n\nThe first change was the addition of Toy Story Midway Mania!, which opened on June 17, 2008. The boardwalk games were then re-themed to incorporate more familiar Disney characters (completed on April 7, 2009), and the Sun Wheel was transformed into Mickey's Fun Wheel with a new color scheme, new lighting effects, and a \"pie-eyed\" Mickey Mouse face replacing the original sun face (completed on May 4, 2009). Following these changes, the \"Route 66\" area was completely re-themed, with the \"S.S. rustworthy\", and \"Dinosaur Jack's Sunglass Shack\" being completely demolished. The Orange Stinger underwent extensive re-theming to become Silly Symphony Swings, based on Walt Disney's 1935 short film \"The Band Concert\". Silly Symphony Swings opened on May 28, 2010. Cosmetic changes were also made to California Screamin': the Mickey Mouse silhouette was altered to represent a sunburst pattern, with a large Paradise Pier sign hanging above the loop, and the scream tubes were also repainted a darker shade of blue.\n\nWalt Disney Imagineering created World of Color, a new nighttime spectacular featuring fountains and projection effects, for Paradise Bay. An area on the northern waterfront was repurposed into a viewing area for the show, known as Paradise Park. World of Color premiered on June 11, 2010, and plays nightly.\n\n—which replaced Golden Dreams—opened June 3, 2011. As of November 2010, Mulholland Madness was closed and reopened July 1, 2011, as \"Goofy’s Sky School\", inspired by Walt Disney's 1940 short film \"Goofy's Glider\".\n\nOn June 23, 2018, part of Paradise Pier reopened as Pixar Pier, inspired by films from Pixar Animation Studios. California Screamin' became the Incredicoaster, Mickey's Fun Wheel opened as the Pixar Pal-A-Round, with Pixar characters on its gondolas, and Jessie's Critter Carousel opened in 2019 taking the place of King Triton's carousel. The Maliboomer closed in 2010 and was unused garden space until it was replaced by the Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind attraction in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Previously, the Special Far Eastern Army had been the theatre command in the Far East, but due to increased tensions with Japan it was expanded into the Far Eastern Front. The 1st Army was created from the Primorsky Group of Forces, and was responsible for the Ussuri area with its headquarters at Voroshilov (now Ussuriysk). Elements of the army fought in the Battle of Lake Khasan. On 4 September, the front was dissolved, and the army became the 1st Separate Red Banner Army, controlling troops in Ussuriysk Oblast and parts of Khabarovsk and Primorsky Oblasts. It was directly subordinated to the People's Commissariat of Defense and operationally controlled the Pacific Fleet. It included the 21st, 22nd, 26th, 32nd, 39th, 40th, 59th, 66th, 92nd, and 105th Rifle Divisions, as well as the 8th, 22nd, and 31st Cavalry Divisions from 4 September. Elements of the army fought in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in mid-1939.\n\nBy an order of the People's Commissariat of Defense dated 21 June 1940, the Far Eastern Front was reformed. The army became part of the front and was redesignated the 1st Red Banner Army.\n\nIts initial commander was the later Marshal of the Soviet Union, Andrei Yeremenko. When Yeremenko arrived in early 1941, the Army was responsible for all the frontier between Vladivostok and Khabarovsk; on 18 March 1941, the 25th Army was established to cover the southern sector. The 32nd, 40th, and 105th Rifle Divisions transferred to the 25th Army in May. In June, the 79th Fighter Aviation Division began forming as part of the army's Air Force. The 32nd and 34th Mixed Aviation Divisions had joined the army by June as well.\n\nThe official Soviet archives list the composition of the Army on 22 June 1941:\n\n6 rifle divisions, 3 tank brigades (75th, 77th, 257th), 3 SP regiments, 6 SP battalions, 1 heavy tank/SP gun regiment, 5 artillery brigades.\n\nUntil the war's end in 1945, the 1st Red Banner Army covered some of the long far eastern borders of the Soviet Union. In August 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, and the Soviet Far East Front attacked into Japanese-occupied Manchuria, as part of the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, led by Marshal of the Soviet Union Aleksandr Vasilevsky. The area the Army was to operate through was mountainous, rugged taiga, and it was specifically tailored to the conditions it would face, in common with the other formations earmarked for the operation. The Army's forces at the beginning of the offensive included 26th and 59th Rifle Corps, 6 rifle divisions, 3 tank brigades (75th, 77th, 257th), 3 SP regiments, 6 SP battalions, 1 heavy tank/SP gun regiment, 5 artillery brigades, and 410 tanks/SP guns and 1,413 guns/mortars. The 6th and 112th Fortified Regions also formed part of the Army. The First Army's attack was aimed at northern Manchukuo.\n\nIn September 1945 the army became part of the newly formed Transbaikal–Amur Military District after moving its headquarters to Blagoveshchensk, where it absorbed troops from the disbanded 15th Army and 2nd Red Banner Army. On 1 October it included the 26th Rifle Corps with the 3rd, 12th, and 231st Rifle Divisions, the 59th Rifle Corps with the 39th and 59th Rifle Divisions, and the 101st Fortified Region. By the end of the year, the 35th Rifle Division had joined the 59th Rifle Corps and the 4th and 102nd Fortified Regions became part of the army. In 1946, the three fortified regions were converted into the 13th and 14th Machine Gun Artillery Brigades. The headquarters of the 26th Rifle Corps was disbanded in July, and the 3rd and 59th Rifle Divisions disbanded on 30 August. The 59th Rifle Corps was disbanded in March 1947.\n\nIn May, the army was transferred to the Far Eastern Military District after the Transbaikal–Amur Military District was disbanded. It included the 37th Guards Airborne Corps with three divisions, the 13th and 14th Machine Gun Artillery Brigades, and the 12th and 39th Rifle Divisions, the former at Kuybyshevka-Vostochnaya and the latter at Khabarovsk. In 1948, the army included the 11th and 13th Machine Gun Artillery Divisions, formed from the 34th Rifle Division and the 11th, 13th, and 14th Machine Gun Artillery Brigades, previously reorganized into regiments. The army headquarters was disbanded in April 1953.\n\nThe following officers commanded the army during its existence:\n\n"}

The most common uses of music in professional wrestling is that of the entrance theme, a song or piece of instrumental music which plays as a performer approaches the ring. After a match, the entrance theme of the victor will normally be played as they exit the ring. Entrance themes are used to alert the audience to the immediate arrival of a wrestler, and to increase anticipation.\n\nEntrance themes are often tailored to the gimmick of the wrestler they are written or selected for. For example, Jacob and Eli Blu (The Blu Brothers) had an entrance theme in the World Wrestling Federation that resembled a piece of blues music, while The Undertaker has often used entrance themes which resemble a dirge, including the ringing of an eerie bell and a quote of Chopin's Funeral March. In practice, modern day entrance themes are normally metal, rock, rap, or R&B (especially for women), as these genres of music are popular with the professional wrestling key demographics.\n\nSome entrance themes are accompanied by the wrestler's recorded voice saying their signature phrase. Examples of this include The Rock's recorded voice saying, \"If you smell what the Rock is cookin'!\" before his music starts, Booker T saying \"Don't hate the player. Hate the game\" (WCW) and \"Can you dig it, sucka?\" (WWE) followed by his entrance theme and Ric Flair's signature exclamation of \"Wooooooo!\" prior to his entrance theme.\n\nDue to licensing costs, entrance themes are often composed by the promotion for which the wrestlers perform in order to avoid having to pay royalties. A promotion might also purchase music from production libraries, which is considered to be cheaper than the royalties of commercial music, or use public domain music, which is available for no fee. Due to less restrictive copyright laws in Mexico, lucha libre promotions use mostly popular songs. In addition, ECW used popular music in order to promote a hip, edgy, counter-culture image.\n\nIn the early 1950s, female champion Mildred Burke often entered to theme music, while Gorgeous George was associated with \"Pomp and Circumstance\", a song which was later used regularly by Randy Savage. Sgt. Slaughter, who has sometimes claimed to have introduced the idea to Vincent J. McMahon, entered to the \"Marines' Hymn\" at a Madison Square Garden show in the 1970s. Though British wrestler Big Daddy had been using \"We Shall Not Be Moved\" as his entrance music in the 1970s in the United Kingdom. However, the practice did not become widespread until the 1980s, when the Fabulous Freebirds, Hulk Hogan, the Junkyard Dog, and various World Class Championship Wrestling performers began using rock music for entrance themes.\n\nMusic is also used as a promotional tool during advertisements, video packages, and as the theme of television programs.\n\nThe following are composers known for composing numerous in-house theme songs for particular wrestling promotions:\n"}

{"id": "2129346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2129346", "title": "TILLING (molecular biology)", "text": "TILLING (molecular biology)\n\nTILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes) is a method in molecular biology that allows directed identification of mutations in a specific gene. TILLING was introduced in 2000, using the model plant \"Arabidopsis thaliana\". TILLING has since been used as a reverse genetics method in other organisms such as zebrafish, corn, wheat, rice, soybean, tomato and lettuce.\n\nThe method combines a standard and efficient technique of mutagenesis using a chemical mutagen such as ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) with a sensitive DNA screening-technique that identifies single base mutations (also called point mutations) in a target gene. The TILLING method relies on the formation of DNA heteroduplexes that are formed when multiple alleles are amplified by PCR and are then heated and slowly cooled. A “bubble” forms at the mismatch of the two DNA strands, which is then cleaved by a single stranded nucleases. The products are then separated by size on several different platforms (see below).\n\nMismatches may be due to induced mutation, heterozygosity within an individual, or natural variation between individuals.\n\nEcoTILLING is a method that uses TILLING techniques to look for natural mutations in individuals, usually for population genetics analysis. DEcoTILLING is a modification of TILLING and EcoTILLING which uses an inexpensive method to identify fragments. Since the advent of NGS sequencing technologies, TILLING-by-sequencing has been developed based on Illumina sequencing of target genes amplified from multidimensionally pooled templates to identify possible single-nucleotide changes.\n\nThere are several sources for single strand nucleases. The first widely used enzyme was mung bean nuclease, but this nuclease has been shown to have high non-specific activity, and only works at low pH, which can degrade PCR products and dye-labeled primers. The original source for single strand nuclease was from CEL1, or CJE (celery juice extract), but other products have entered the market including Frontier Genomics’ SNiPerase enzymes, which have been optimized for use on platforms that use labeled and unlabeled PCR products (see next section). Transgenomic isolated the single strand nuclease protein and sells it as a recombinant form. The advantage of the recombinant form is that unlike the enzyme mixtures, it does not contain non-specific nuclease activity, which can degrade the dyes on the PCR primers. The disadvantage is a substantially higher cost.\n\nThe first paper describing TILLING used HPLC to identify mutations (McCallum et al., 2000a). The method was made more high throughput by using the restriction enzyme Cel-I combined with the LICOR gel based system to identify mutations (Colbert et al.,2001). Advantages to using this system are that mutation sites can be easily confirmed and differentiated from noise. This is because different colored dyes can be used for the forward and reverse primers. Once the cleavage products have been run on a gel, it can be viewed in separate channels, and much like an RFLP, the fragment sizes within a lane in each channel should add up to the full length product size. Advantages to the LICOR system are separation of large fragments (~ 2kb), high sample throughput (96 samples loaded on paper combs), and freeware to identify the mutations (GelBuddy). Drawbacks to the LICOR system is having to pour slab gels and long run times (~4 hours). TILLING and EcoTILLING methods are now being used on capillary systems from, Advanced Analytical Technologies, ABI and Beckman.\n\nSeveral systems can be used to separate PCR products that are not labeled with dyes. Simple agarose electrophoresis systems will separate cleavage products inexpensively and with standard lab equipment. This was used to discover SNPs in chum salmon and was referred to as DEcoTILLING. The disadvantage of this system is reduced resolution compared to polyacrylamide systems. Elchrom Scientific sells Spreadex gels which are precast, can be high throughput and are more sensitive than standard polyacrylamide gels. Advanced Analytical Technologies Inc sells the AdvanCE FS96 dsDNA Fluorescent System which is a 96 capillary electrophoresis system that has several advantages over traditional methods; including ability to separate large fragments (up to 40kb), no desalting or precipitation step required, short run times (~30 minutes), sensitivity to 5pg/ul and no need for fluorescent labeled primers.\n\nSeveral TILLING centers exist over the world that focus on agriculturally important species:\n\n\n\n"}

An elite cooking competition had placed him enviably in front of many aspiring colleagues and he seemed to have the world at his feet. However, the competition placed him in a dilemma of conflicting interests of heart - his own craft or the woman whom he loves.\n\nHis obsession (and persistently stubborn attitude) with his work confirmed that he did not appear to hold his girlfriend in a special regard. She was about to give birth to their child, at the same time he was about to participate in an important and prestigious cooking contest. She dumped him for disregarding the relationship. Realising that a successful career can only be shared with a significant other, Kit turned bitter. He became an alcoholic, traumatized by the separation. Five years later, his career diminished and he was quickly forgotten. To further compound problems, his sense of taste appeared to have left him due to his constant drunken state, and he became cranky and unsociable.\n\nElsewhere, a popular Chinese restaurant in Hong Kong owned by Au was approached by an organisation 'Super Group' who wished to merge all major Chinese restaurants into a powerful group to eliminate all opposition in Asia. Au protested and the Super Group supremo throws down a challenge to cook the legendary Manchu Han Imperial Feast, where the loser would be absorbed into the Super Group indefinitely. Au's employees were poached over to 'Super Group', being promised that they will own a share of the restaurant and better salary if Au loses the challenge.\n\nAu then enlists the assistance of a former triad member, a rookie chef named Sun who aspires to be a top chef, and had worked at Au's restaurant wishing to shed his criminal past together with Au's daughter Wai. After several foiled attempts at preparing even a simple dish, they realise the futility of their initial efforts as the Feast could only be accomplished by a master chef and their limited cooking skills would be of no use if they were to save their establishment.\n\nThey seek the help of Lung Kwun-bo, a master chef, but he did not know how to cook the Imperial Feast. Lung recommended them to seek Kit in China to engage his service to cook in the challenge. After meeting Kit and verifying that his skills are gone, Lung got both of them to find his wife to wake Kit up. Kit and his wife reunited after some persuasion. With the assistance of Lung, Sun and Wai managed to stimulate Kit's skills back.\n\nDuring the tournament, the contestants prepared rare and luxurious dishes. Kit was able to recapture his previous glories and ultimately saved Au's restaurant after a closely fought contest. The movie would eventually end on a happy note as is the theme of all Lunar New Year movies.\n\nSources: \n\n\n\n"}

Her background in economics and her familiarity with European affairs enabled her to fill a number of important State Department positions.\n\nDulles graduated from Wykeham Rise School in Washington, Connecticut, and attended Bryn Mawr College, graduating with a B.A. in 1917. She spent two years working for relief organizations in France. When World War I ended, she continued her schooling in the U.S. and in Europe. Beginning in 1923, she studied at Radcliffe College and Harvard University, earning her M.A. from the former in 1924 and a doctorate in economics from the latter in 1926, writing her thesis on the French franc. She taught economics at Simmons College during the 1924–1925 academic year. For the next ten years she taught economics at various colleges, including Simmons, Bryn Mawr, and the University of Pennsylvania. As a student and college professor she made frequent trips to Europe to study and conduct research on European financial matters. Though she married in 1932, she always used her maiden name professionally.\n\nIn 1933, she argued against the supposed benefits of inflationary government policies in \"The Dollar, the Franc and Inflation\".\n\nIn 1936, Dulles entered government service. Her first position was at the Social Security Board, where she studied the economic aspects of financing the Social Security program. In April 1942 she transferred to the Board of Economic Warfare where she spent five months studying various types of international economic matters. In September 1942, she joined the Department of State, where she worked, aside from a short stint at the Department of Commerce, for almost twenty years, beginning as an Economic Officer in the Division of Postwar Planning.\n\nDuring her first three years at the State Department, Dulles was involved in post-war economic planning. She helped determine the U.S. position on international financial cooperation and participated in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 at which the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development were established. After the end of World War II, in the spring of 1945 she went to Europe where she became involved in the reconstruction of the Austrian economy as the U.S. Financial Attaché in Austria.\n\nIn 1949 Eleanor transferred to the German Austrian Division at the State Department where she took an active interest in the affairs of Berlin. She worked for the Commerce Department for several months in 1951-1952, and then returned to the State Department Office of German Affairs shortly before her brother John Foster Dulles became Secretary of State. She successfully resisted his attempts to remove her from her position. She made many trips to Berlin and was involved in planning the construction of the Berlin Medical Center. The Berlin Congress Hall, the U.S. contribution to the International Building Exhibition was nicknamed the \"Dulleseum\" (Dulles plus Museum) for the role of Eleanor and her brother John Foster in its financing and construction. Later, she was hailed as \"the Mother of Berlin\" for helping to revitalize Berlin's economy and culture during the 1950s.\n\nIn 1958, she described the working environment at the State Department:\nIn 1959 Dulles transferred from the German Desk to the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, where she became involved in a study of economic conditions in underdeveloped countries. As part of the study she traveled extensively in Africa, Latin America and South Asia.\n\nSecretary of State Dean Rusk requested her resignation on September 21, 1961, at the insistence of the Kennedy Administration following the April Bay of Pigs Invasion, a foreign relations disaster for the U.S. that her brother Allen had overseen as head of the CIA. She resigned in January 1962. She returned to teaching, first at Duke University and then at Georgetown University.\n\nShe authored several books on U.S. foreign policy. In 1963 she published a study of her brother's final year at the State Department, \"John Foster Dulles: The Last Year\", with a foreword by President Eisenhower. She continued her trips abroad, sometimes as a representative of the U.S. Government. In 1967, she represented the United States at the funeral of Konrad Adenauer. She also wrote several books describing conditions in Germany.\n\nIn 1978, she criticized Leonard Mosley's biography of her and her brothers, \"Dulles\". She had given the author several interviews, but said his \"implication that three people could connive to produce a foreign policy is a schoolboy approach\". She said it contain 900 errors, twice as many as Townsend Hoopes' hostile study \"The Devil and John Foster Dulles\".\n\nShe wrote a study of Dean Acheson and John Foster Dulles that found commonality in their approaches to deterrence. It remained unpublished at her death.\n\nRadcliffe gave her its Distinguished Achievement Award in 1955. In 1957 the Free University of Berlin gave her an honorary doctorate and she received the Carl Schurz Plaque.\n\nIn 1993, Dulles donated a collection of her documents to the Mount Vernon College for Women, which merged with the George Washington University in 1999. The collection contains a variety of materials that document both her professional and personal life. It is currently cared for by GWU's Special Collections Research Center, located in the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library.\n\nEleanor Lansing Dulles was born on June 1, 1895, in Watertown, New York, the daughter of Allen Macy Dulles and Edith Foster. Her grandfather, John Watson Foster, served as United States Secretary of State under President Benjamin Harrison, for eight months. Her mother's sister married Robert Lansing, Secretary of State under President Woodrow Wilson. Her oldest brother, John Foster Dulles, was Secretary of State under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Her brother Allen Dulles served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 1953 to 1961. She had two sisters as well. Her nephew Avery Dulles was a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nEleanor Lansing Dulles married Professor David Simon Blondheim (1884–1934) on December 6, 1932. Blondheim had been a Medieval Studies fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation in 1926 and then a professor at Johns Hopkins University from 1929 to 1932. He was Romance philologist with a specialty in Judeo-Romance, a field that in many ways he invented. Blondheim committed suicide in 1934. Dulles and Blondheim had a son, David Dulles, born seven months after his father's death. She later adopted a girl, Ann Welsh Dulles (born 1937, married in 1962 to become Anne Welsh Joor). Her children survived her.\n\nDulles died on October 30, 1996, in a retirement home in Washington, D.C., and was buried in Rock Creek Cemetery there.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2129381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2129381", "title": "Suspect (1987 film)", "text": "Suspect (1987 film)\n\nSuspect is a 1987 American legal mystery thriller film directed by Peter Yates and starring Cher, Dennis Quaid and Liam Neeson. Other notable cast members include John Mahoney, Joe Mantegna, Fred Melamed and Philip Bosco.\n\nAround Christmas, a United States Supreme Court Justice commits suicide, for which no explanation or context is given. We see the justice making a tape recording and then shooting himself. Shortly thereafter, the body of Elizabeth Quinn, a file clerk at the Justice Department, is found floating in the Potomac River, and Carl Wayne Anderson (Liam Neeson), a homeless, deaf Vietnam veteran, is arrested for the crime, based almost entirely on the fact that he was seen sleeping in Quinn's car the night of her murder. Kathleen Riley (Cher) is the beleaguered D.C. public defender assigned to represent Anderson.\n\nThe car was abandoned in a desolate K Street parking lot. Anderson, it is eventually revealed, found the car unlocked and was looking for a warm place to sleep since it was the dead of winter. But since he was homeless, had no alibi, and was also found in possession of Quinn's wallet, he was arrested for her murder.\n\nRiley finds it difficult to communicate with Anderson. Over time, she begins to penetrate his hard exterior and he tries to cooperate with her efforts to mount his defense.\n\nRiley approves an agribusiness lobbyist who normally works on Capitol Hill, Eddie Sanger (Dennis Quaid), as a member of the jury despite his attempt to be excused. Sanger begins investigating the details of the murder, eventually teaming up with Riley beyond the observation of the trial's suspicious judge.\n\nSanger also keeps busy in his work as a lobbyist, including efforts to win passage of a bill by seducing a Congresswoman.\n\nAs Riley's investigation, with Sanger's unethical assistance, intensifies, they begin to focus on Deputy Attorney General Paul Gray (Philip Bosco). Figuring that a key found on the victim's body has something to do with the Justice Department (where Quinn worked), Riley and Sanger break into the file department there late one night and try to find what the key unlocks. They find a file cabinet containing trial transcripts from federal cases from 1968 that Quinn was in the process of transcribing. \n\nThe trial is conducted by the stern Judge Matthew Helms (John Mahoney). Helms is rumored to be the president's nominee for a seat on the prestigious United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. He begins to suspect that Riley is collaborating with Sanger, which would be a disbarrable offense of jury tampering, but has no proof.\n\nIn a law library, Riley and Sanger narrowly avoid being caught by Helms, who sequesters the jury to avoid any possible further contact between them. \n\nRiley and Sanger suspect that Quinn stumbled onto something and look for any case that might have an impropriety. Fixing a case requires the participation of both the prosecutor and the trial judge. Riley and Sanger think they will find evidence that Gray was the prosecutor on a rigged 1968 case, which would be his motive to murder Quinn if she approached him about what she found.\n\nRiley goes back to Quinn's car (still impounded where it was found in a government parking lot) and finds an audiotape the police did not uncover in their half-hearted investigation. The tape is the one made by the Supreme Court justice who committed suicide. In it, he confesses to conspiring to fix a case in 1968 (with a politically influential defendant) in return for an appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nRiley assumes Gray was the prosecutor on that case and goes back to the courthouse to retrieve the case book that will confirm it. She is pursued and attacked by a disguised, unidentified person. Sanger, having managed to escape sequestration by creating a diversion with a fire alarm, helps Riley, and she manages to slice the right wrist of her assailant, who then flees. \n\nGray shows up in the courtroom, to Judge Helms's surprise. Riley surprisingly announces that she wants Judge Helms to take the stand as a witness. An irate Helms says Riley cannot make him testify. Riley reveals that it was Helms, not Gray, who was the prosecutor in the fixed case of 1968. In exchange for fixing the case, Helms was nominated to the District Court. Seventeen years later, Quinn inadvertently discovered the case fixing. At the same time, Helms learned he was a likely nominee for the Court of Appeals. Quinn approached the Supreme Court justice, who responded by committing suicide. When she approached Helms, however, he murdered her. As the judge angrily bangs his gavel during Riley's accusation, his right wrist begins to bleed from where Riley slashed him the night before, confirming his identity as the killer. \n\nRiley ends up reinvigorated in her job and in a relationship with Sanger.\n\n\nThe film's climactic scene (in which the actual murderer is revealed) was panned by Roger Ebert, whose review noted that it is \"as if an Agatha Christie novel evaluated six suspects in a British country house, and then in the last chapter we discover the killer was a guy from next door.\"\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 67%, based on 18 reviews, and an average rating of 6.16/10.\n\n\n"}

Initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, she was transferred to the Home Fleet in 1936. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. \"Bulldog\" saw service throughout World War II on convoy escort duty during the Battle of the Atlantic and in the Arctic. Her most notable actions were the capture of a complete Enigma machine and codebooks from the in 1941, and sinking another German submarine in 1944. The surrender of the German garrisons of the Channel Islands was signed on 9 May 1945 aboard \"Bulldog\". Redundant after the war, she was broken up for scrap in 1946.\n\n\"Bulldog\" displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum boilers. \"Bulldog\" carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship's complement was 134 officers and enlisted men, which increased to 142 during wartime.\n\n\"Bulldog\" mounted four 45-calibre quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch Mk IX guns in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. She was briefly fitted with a C XIII mount capable of 60-degree elevation for testing purposes. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, \"Bulldog\" had two QF 2-pounder Mk II AA guns mounted on a platform between her funnels. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. The ship was fitted with a Type 119 ASDIC set to detect submarines through sound waves beamed into the water that would reflect off the submarine.\n\nBy April 1941, the ship's AA armament had been increased when the rear set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a (12-pounder) AA gun. In late 1941, the ship was converted to an escort destroyer with the replacement of her 'A' gun by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. By April 1943, the 'Y' gun had been removed to compensate for the increase to 70 depth charges. Additional depth charge stowage later replaced the 12-pounder high-angle gun. The 2-pounder mounts were replaced by Oerlikon autocannon and two additional Oerlikon guns were also added in the forward superstructure. To combat German E-boats, a QF 6-pounder gun was mounted at the very tip of the bow in 1944.\n\nThe ship was ordered on 22 March 1929 from Swan Hunter at Wallsend, under the 1928 Naval Programme. She was laid down on 10 August 1929, and launched on 6 December 1930, as the sixth RN ship to carry this name. \"Bulldog\" was completed on 8 April 1931 at a cost of £221,408, excluding items supplied by the Admiralty such as guns, ammunition and communications equipment. After her commissioning, she was assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet until September 1936, when it was transferred to the Home Fleet. \"Bulldog\" aided survivors of the 1932 Ierissos earthquake and patrolled southern Spanish waters during the first month of the Spanish Civil War. During her time in the Mediterranean, the ship was refitted at Gibraltar in 1932 and 1935 and in Malta in 1936. Once she returned to Britain, \"Bulldog\" was almost continuously under repair or refitting at Chatham Dockyard until 9 January 1937. She remained with the 4th Flotilla until January 1939, and made multiple deployments off the coast of Spain enforcing the embargo until 31 March 1938, when she was refitted, this time at Sheerness Dockyard. The ship escorted the battleship to Scapa Flow in September during the Munich Crisis. \"Bulldog\" was briefly assigned to the Gibraltar Local Flotilla in January 1939, until she became plane guard for the aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean in March.\n\nIn October she was deployed with \"Glorious\", the battleship and the destroyer as part of a Hunting Group in the Indian Ocean, based at Socotra. She sailed to Malta with \"Glorious\" in January 1940 to refit, returning to plane guard duty in March, this time for . In April \"Bulldog\" had repairs made to her feed water heater at Devonport, that lasted until 3 May. \"Bulldog\" joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow and sailed on 9 May, with a force consisting of the cruiser and thirteen destroyers, to search off the mouth of the Skagerrak for German minelayers. The British force was spotted by German E-boats and the minelayers returned to base before they could be intercepted. One of the E-boats torpedoed the destroyer the next day and seriously damaged her. \"Bulldog\" towed \"Kelly\" to Hebburn for repairs, sustaining damage to her stern structure during the tow, which was repaired by Swan Hunter from 13 to 21 May.\n\nThe ship damaged her propellers on 27 May and was under repairs at Chatham Dockyard until 4 June, when she was transferred to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla. She sailed for Le Havre, France on 9 June, to assist in the evacuation of British troops before advancing German troops (Operation Cycle). The next afternoon, she was severely damaged by three hits from German aircraft that knocked out her steering gear. \"Bulldog\"s crew was able to temporarily repair the steering gear and the ship reached Portsmouth Dockyard early the following morning. Whilst under repair, she was further damaged by splinters during an air raid on 24 August. \"Bulldog\" rejoined the flotilla after her repairs were completed on 2 September.\n\nShe was refitted at Cammell Laird from 2 January to 18 February 1941, and was assigned to the 3rd Escort Group for convoy escort duties to and from Iceland. Commander Joe Baker-Cresswell was the ship's captain as well as the commander of the group. Together with the destroyer and the sloop , she damaged on 7 May, while escorting Convoy OB 318 off Iceland. Two days later, the corvette depth-charged \"U-110\", forcing her to the surface. \"Bulldog\" and the destroyer fired on, and then closed on the U-boat, whose crew were abandoning the boat. Sub-Lieutenant David Balme of \"Bulldog\" led a boarding party that removed the Enigma coding machine and various codebooks. This was of immense help to the Government Code and Cypher School in breaking German naval codes. She took the submarine in tow, but it sank the following morning. \"Bulldog\" remained on Atlantic convoy duties until October, when she sailed to Fairfields in Govan, Glasgow, for conversion into an escort destroyer, a process that lasted until February 1942. As part of the conversion, a Type 271 target indication radar was installed above the bridge, that replaced her director-control tower and rangefinder. By 1944 a Type 290 short-range surface search radar was also fitted.\n\n\"Bulldog\" was an unattached ship assigned to Western Approaches Command from 10 February 1942, and aided the destroyer after she had collided with the American merchant ship on 31 March whilst escorting Convoy PQ 14 from Eban, Scotland to Reykjavík, Iceland. On 12 April, she rejoined the convoy en route to Murmansk, where they arrived a week later. Beginning on 28 April, she escorted the returning Convoy QP 11 with the same ships. Two days later the light cruiser joined the convoy. Whilst taking position ahead of the convoy later that day, \"Edinburgh\" was hit by two torpedoes fired by . The cruiser, heavily damaged and with her steering gear wrecked, was taken in tow for the voyage back to Murmansk. On 1 May the convoy was attacked by the German destroyers Z7 \"Hermann Schoemann\", , and which had been searching for \"Edinburgh\". Commander Maxwell Richmond, \"Bulldog\"s captain and commander of the escorts, interposed his four destroyers between the Germans and the merchantmen and drove off the Germans in a three-hour battle during which \"Bulldog\" was lightly damaged by shell splinters. She was repaired from 2 June to 14 August, after which she was assigned to the Greenock Special Escort Division. In November she escorted British ships participating in the Allied landings in North Africa (Operation Torch), before returning to Greenock for repairs from 23 November to 14 December.\n\n\"Bulldog\" was assigned to the escort for Convoy JW 51B on 20 December, but had to return home for weather repairs on 28 December. After repairs were completed on 16 January 1943, she escorted convoys between Iceland and the UK for the next two months. The ship was under repair at Greenock from 29 March to 22 April, after which she sailed to Freetown for escort duties between Lagos, Nigeria, Freetown and Gibraltar. \"Bulldog\" returned home in October for a lengthy refit at Portsmouth Dockyard that lasted from 8 November to 24 May 1944. In June she began escort duties between the River Clyde and the Faeroe Islands, and sank on 26 June.\n\nOn 20 August, her hull was badly damaged after a collision with the frigate in Gourock Bay. After repairs at Ardrossan that lasted until 4 September, she resumed local convoy duties between the Faeroes, the Clyde and Scapa Flow until she required major machinery repairs in November. Upon their completion on 30 January 1945, \"Bulldog\" escorted convoys between Plymouth and various ports in the Irish Sea for the rest of the war. On 9 May 1945 she sailed to Guernsey where she participated in the Liberation of the German-occupied Channel Islands who formally surrendered to British representatives aboard the ship. The ship was placed in Category 'B' reserve on 27 May at Dartmouth. She was transferred to Rosyth on 27 November and was reduced to Category 'C' reserve on 13 December. \"Bulldog\" was approved for scrapping on 22 December and turned over to Metal Industries, Limited on 17 January 1946.\n\n\n"}

They both involve moving certain substances into their proper containers. The music in both games was recorded by Michael Beckett.\n\nEnigmo was created in 2003 by Pangea Software and was their most successful game ever sold at the time. The graphics are three-dimensional, in a sense; but gameplay is strictly limited to the horizontal and vertical axes. Liquids (water, oil, and lava) fall from \"droppers\" and will bounce around the walls of a mechanism. Gameplay consists of manipulating a limited number of dynamic items (such as bumpers, sliders, accelerators, and sponges) to affect various streams of flowing liquid so that the droplets reach their destination: \"tanks\" specific for each liquid. The player wins the level when all tanks on the level are filled with 50 drops of the appropriate liquid. In addition to the pre-designed levels, players can create their own using the game's built-in editor and download others for free off of the Pangea website.\n\nIn 2004, Aspyr Media ported a 2003 release of Enigmo to the Windows Mobile platform. This version was included with the Dell Axim x50v model PDA; the software is available for purchase from Dell and appears to be limited to the x50v model.\n\nIn January 2011, a version of Enigmo is set to be released in the PlayStation Store as a PSP Mini. It will be developed and published by Beatshapers.\n\nIn May 2011, a version of Enigmo was released for Windows Phone 7.\n\nEnigmo 2 was introduced in February 2006, and expands upon the basic principles set down by the original. Water is still a substance that can be manipulated, but lava and oil were swapped for laser beams and plasma particles. The game adds the dimension of depth to gameplay, and many solutions involving rotating the camera or objects in three dimensions. The graphics were also improved. The game takes place in outer space, specifically near Earth, Mars, Saturn, and asteroids, but gravity functions as it would on earth. Like the original, each container must have 50 units to be considered \"full\". When all containers are simultaneously full (they lose their contents over time), the player wins the level.\n\nDuring WWDC 2008, it was announced that an iOS version of Enigmo was in development and would be available for purchase for the price of US$9.99 at the launch of the App Store. The game makes use of the iPhone's multi touch interface and is controlled entirely via touch. Players can use the swiping and pinching actions to zoom and pan and use their fingers to position the puzzle pieces. The game has been a success; it was voted the \"Best iPhone Game\" at WWDC '08 and has been met with very positive reviews in the App Store. Originally including only 50 levels, Enigmo has been updated to allow user designed levels created on the desktop versions of the game; the price was dropped to US$4.99 at that time. It was then dropped to US$1.99 on October 8, 2008 and later to US$0.99 for Black Friday. It is currently on sale for $0.99.\nEnigmo for iPhone and iPod Touch are now available in Dutch, German, Spanish, Japanese, Italian, and French. JR Language Translations provided the localisation of the game to Pangea Software.\n\nOn September 2, 2009, Pangea Software released Enigmo 2 for the iPhone.

He is nicknamed \"The Beast\" due to his size and physical presence on the football field.\n\nBaptista began his career as a defensive midfielder, and after a series of impressive performances for his hometown squad São Paulo FC, Baptista signed for Sevilla FC in 2003. Upon signing for Sevilla, he was converted into a forward, and in his two seasons, he scored 50 goals, leading to his 2005 transfer to Spanish giants Real Madrid. After two unsuccessful seasons at Real Madrid with a loan spell at Arsenal sandwiched in between, Baptista transferred to Roma in Italy. In January 2011 he returned to Spain by signing for Málaga, and two years later went back to Brazil with Cruzeiro.\n\nOn 3 August 2003, Sevilla FC unveiled Baptista as their newest signing. He cost the Spanish club £1.75 million (US$3.75 million). Baptista made it clear he was confident that he would succeed in Spain. He donned the No.19 jersey and began playing as an attacking midfielder. Baptista settled in quickly, scoring a double in Sevilla's 4–0 victory over Racing de Santander. As the season progressed, his good form continued, including a double against Levante UD and once more hitting the back of the net against Racing de Santander, this time with four goals as Sevilla picked up a 5–2 victory at home.\n\nHis form attracted the attention of several big clubs, but despite interest from English giants Arsenal, Baptista remained at Sevilla for the following season, in which he once more showed his worth registering 25 goals in all competitions.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2005, Baptista made 81 appearances in all competitions for Sevilla and scored 50 goals in total. With this goal tally came a summer of transfer rumours in which Real Madrid battled it out with Arsenal for his signature.\n\nOn 25 July 2005, Real Madrid confirmed the signing of the long-time Arsenal target for a fee of £13.8 million (€20 million), rising to £16.9 million (€24.5 million); Baptista signed a five-year deal. Baptista said he had chosen to remain in Spain at least one more year, as transferring to Real Madrid would allow him to gain dual citizenship (in Spain as well as Brazil), which would enable him to travel across Europe freely. He also explained he did not want to move to England at this time. Upon his arrival at Real Madrid, Baptista was awarded the No.8 jersey.\n\nThe season looked very promising for Real Madrid; the big-money signings of Robinho from Santos FC, Baptista, and Sergio Ramos from Sevilla meant that Real Madrid were tipped to end their trophy drought. It was not to be, however. At Real, Baptista was often played out of position as a left-winger to accommodate the likes of Zinedine Zidane and Guti in the Spanish side's attacking line-up. For this reason, he was unable to find the form that led many of Europe's top clubs to want to sign him. He managed to score just eight league goals throughout the 2006 league campaign. The season ended in disappointment as Real Madrid yet again ended the season without a trophy.\n\nBaptista insisted that Arsenal were still in pursuit of him, but he made it clear he wanted to fulfill his contract with Real Madrid.\n\nAt the end of August 2006, with the transfer window about to close, press reports linked him with a move to either Tottenham Hotspur or Arsenal. The latter was part of a possible swap deal that included José Antonio Reyes. Baptista went on to strenuously claim that he was not interested in a move away from Real Madrid. However, on 31 August 2006, the day of the transfer deadline, Baptista moved to Arsenal in exchange for Reyes. The deal saw both players signing on to 12-month loans at their new clubs. He scored his first goal for Arsenal against Hamburg in the Champions League on 21 November 2006.\n\nBaptista struggled to score in the Premier League, managing just three goals in 24 league matches. Baptista, however, found scoring form in the League Cup, with six goals in the competition, including a club record four goals in Arsenal's quarter-final victory against Liverpool on 9 January 2007, in a 6–3 win for Arsenal; beside his 4 goals, he also missed a penalty kick in that game, and missed two other penalties that season against Bolton Wanderers and Portsmouth. Baptista also scored twice in Arsenal's semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur (having also scored an own goal at the other end), but they lost 2–1 to Chelsea in the final.\n\nIn total, Baptista scored 10 goals in 35 appearances for Arsenal.\n\nAt the end of the 2006–07 season, he was no longer required by Arsenal and returned to Real Madrid, as the loan deal finished. After the appointment of Bernd Schuster as head coach of Madrid, Baptista played far more often and in his preferred central position.\n\nBaptista went on to score first in a 3-0 victory that knocked Lazio out of the Champions League. He then netted a magnificent first half goal from a one-two pass from Ruud van Nistelrooy against rivals FC Barcelona in the El Clásico. Baptista's goal proved to be vital in a game that eventually finished 1-0 to the visitors. This was only the second time Real Madrid had beaten rivals Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 24 years.\n\nDuring the season, Baptista continued his good form. This led to many praising his good performances as he continued to keep Guti on the bench. Real eventually won that season's La Liga title with Baptista thus earning a winner's medal.\n\nRoma ended their search for another forward on 14 August, when they signed Baptista from Real Madrid. The Serie A club said in a statement that the 26-year-old had cost an initial €9 million plus bonuses and had penned a four-year deal worth €4.5million before tax and excluding bonuses.\n\nBaptista made his debut for Roma in the Supercoppa Italiana on 24 August 2008, but the team lost to Inter Milan on penalties. Baptista converted his penalty kick. On 1 October 2008, he scored his first Champions League goals for the club, scoring a double against Bordeaux to give his side a 3–1 victory. Baptista scored Roma's winning goal in his first Rome derby against Lazio.\n\nIn the Champions League, Roma drew Baptista's former club, Arsenal. He played in both games, the first at the Emirates Stadium, a ground he used to call home, and the return leg at the Stadio Olimpico. In the return leg, Baptista came on as an early substitute, following the early injury to Roma's goalscorer Juan. Baptista had a couple of chances to give Roma the two goal advantage that would have sent them through to the quarter-final stage of the Champions League, most notably a chance in the 79th minute, where he missed from 10 yards out with just Manuel Almunia to beat. Roma lost 7–6 in the ensuing penalty shootout.\n\nOn 3 January 2011, Málaga CF announced the signing of Júlio Baptista. He signed a two-and-a-half-year contract. On 14 January 2011, Roma announced that the transfer fee was €2.5 million. He made his debut for Málaga on 16 January 2011 in a 4–1 defeat at Barcelona, and six days later he scored his first goal in a 4–3 defeat at Valencia CF.\n\nBaptista, however, was injured during the match between Málaga and Getafe CF (and scoring from penalty in a 2–2 draw) and was operated in Brazil couple of days later. He returned to action on 16 April 2011 by scoring twice in a 3–0 home win over RCD Mallorca, taking the team out of the relegation zone.\n\nOn 1 October 2011, Baptista scored a dramatic late winner in a 3–2 win over Getafe with an overhead kick, on his 30th birthday. However, he injured his right leg during the match, and though it was at first thought to be a minor injury he ultimately needed an operation that would keep him out of action for the rest of the year. On 6 March 2012 it was announced that Baptista might miss the rest of the season and would travel to Brazil to recover from his injury. He made his comeback on 3 February 2013, coming on as a substitute in a 1–1 draw against Real Zaragoza. Baptista scored his first goal since his return from injury on 30 March, netting the winner in Malaga's 3-1 defeat of Rayo Vallecano, a result that pushed the side into fourth place in La Liga.\n\nOn 24 July 2013, Málaga CF terminated his contract with the La Liga club.\n\nOn 24 July 2013, Júlio Baptista signed with the Brazilian first division club Cruzeiro Esporte Clube, where he was teamed up with well-known names such as Dedé, Dagoberto, and Fábio. He was reported to be on a two-year contract, with a reportedly €170,000 per month salary.\n\nOn July 28, 2013, Baptista went to the Mineirão Stadium in an armored car, and was presented to \"Celeste\" fans in the club's 4-1 victory against rivals Atlético Mineiro. After his presentation, Baptista did not confirm when he could debut for his new club. According to \"La Bestia\", it depended on \"documentation and of Marcelo Oliveira (Cruzeiro's coach)\".\n\nManager Marcelo Oliveira praised Baptista for working to return to his best shape. Asked in which position Oliveira would play Baptista, he affirmed that Baptista would play as a playmaker, because he played in this position for Sevilla, in his best days. Oliveira also said he wanted Ricardo Goulart instead of Baptista to mark players.\n\nOn 23 March 2016, Orlando City SC announced that they had signed Baptista. He made his Major League Soccer debut on 8 April as a sub against Philadelphia Union, and scored his first goal in the league on 29 May against New York City FC. His contract option was declined by the club on November 23, 2016, making him a free agent.\n\nOn 18 August 2018, Baptista penned a deal for an undisclosed period with Romanian defending champions CFR Cluj. Eight days later, he made his debut in a goalless Liga I draw at Gaz Metan Mediaș, replacing Alexandru Ioniță in the 70th minute. \n\nBaptista became subject of controversy in Romania, having played only 43 minutes for CFR in 2018, which made him one of the best paid football players per minute played.\n\nHe announced his retirement on 23 May 2019. \n\nBaptista has 47 caps with Brazil and has netted five goals. His first cap came on 4 June 2001 in the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, a 0–0 draw against Japan. He also played a limited part in the 2005 edition of the competition.\n\nAs Baptista often played out of position at Real Madrid, his form dipped, and he was not included on the 2006 World Cup roster. However, Baptista was re-called to the Brazil squad for the 2007 Copa América and scored the opening goal in Brazil's 3–0 victory over Argentina in the final on 15 July 2007. Baptista ended the competition with three goals. He went on to play the 2010 World Cup for Brazil under coach Dunga.\n\nSão Paulo\n\nArsenal\n\nReal Madrid\n\nCruzeiro\n\nBrazil Youth\n\nBrazil\n\n\n"}

The town is situated just off the N2 Highway, about 75 km southwest of Port Elizabeth.\n\nJeffreys Bay is named after the senior partner of the firm Jeffrey & Glendinnings that opened a store in 1849 on the location where the town is today. Jeffrey is believed to be the first person to have settled there.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Jeffreys Bay was known as a hippie hangout, where the now-burgeoning surf community originated. Jeffreys Bay has grown from a sleepy little fishing town over the past few years and is one of the fastest expanding urban areas in the country.\n\nXhosa, Afrikaans and English are the three most spoken languages.\n\nJeffreys Bay is a constituent part of the Kouga Local Municipality of the Sarah Baartman District in the Eastern Cape Province.\n\nJeffreys Bay is one of the five most famous surfing destinations (no.2 on one \"best in the world\" surfing list) in the world and hosts the annual World Surf League (WSL) surfing event at Super Tubes during July. Spectators and professional surfers from all over the world flock to this event. In 2015, Mick Fanning was attacked by a shark two minutes into the J-Bay Open finals in Jeffreys Bay. Fanning was in the water with Julian Wilson during the final of the J-Bay Open 2015 when he was attacked by what is suspected to be a great white shark. Fanning punched the shark and tried to wedge his board between the shark and his body, and he emerged from the attack physically unharmed.\n\nA very long, fast, tubing right hand point break breaks along the west side of the bay. The break is regarded as one of the best right hand point breaks in the entire world, in both consistency and quality, in season. It has been divided up into several sections, including, from the top of the point, \"Kitchen Windows\", \"Magna tubes\", \"Boneyards\", \"Supertubes\", \"Impossibles\", \"Tubes\", \"the Point\", and \"Albatross\". \"Supertubes\", which itself breaks for about 300m or more, is regarded as the best part of the wave. On rare occasions (large wave sizes, wide-breaking waves, and even swells), \"Boneyards\" can link up all the way to \"the Point\" for a ride over one kilometre long. Optimal size is considered to be from about 4 to 10 feet (Hawaiian scale), or about 8 to 20 feet wave faces.\n\nThe initial discovery and promotion of the wave is curious. Another nearby right hand point wave at St. Francis Bay was first idolised and promoted in the surf movie \"The Endless Summer\" in the 1960s (although both Jeffreys Bay and St. Francis Bay were probably surfed much earlier). Surfers who travelled to the area soon stumbled upon the nearby Jeffreys Bay surf break, which was found to be not only a faster, more powerful, and hollower wave, but also much more consistent.\n\nThe J-Bay surf village is situated at the top of Da Gama Road. It provides a large collection of the best surf goods, clothing and more in conveniently arranged shops.\n\nJeffreys Bay is a popular tourist destination because of its surfing opportunities and the Blue Flag beach.\n\nJeffreys Bay is famous for abundant seashells, great seafood and calamari. The nearby Kabeljous, Seekoei and Krom River lagoons host numerous water birds, and are also ideal for watersports like canoeing, boardsailing, and fishing. Every year, migrating whales make their way to Hermanus and Witsand to give birth, and whales can be seen breaching almost every day during the season.\n\nJust northeast of the town, on the Kabeljous River, lies the Kabeljous Nature Reserve. It is a walk-about reserve, well known to anglers for a diverse number of fish. The Kabeljous estuary is one of the best preserved estuaries in the Eastern Cape. The lagoon is home to waterfowl, herons, and a variety of waders. Nearby, the Seekoei River Nature Reserve lies between Aston Bay and Paradise Beach. The reserve lies on the estuary formed by the Seekoei and Swart rivers. The reserve is rich in birdlife with over 120 species of birds. The lagoon is also home to numerous red-knobbed coots and small antelope. There is also a circular hiking trail that takes about three hours to complete. The trail starts with a trip on a raft across the lagoon and runs through fynbos and subtropical vegetation.\n\n\n"}

Smith won many of Australia's major art prizes multiple times including the Archibald Prize for portraiture three times; the Wynne Prize twice; the Sulman Prize three times; and the Blake Prize for Religious Art six times.\n\nEric Smith was born and raised in Brunswick, Melbourne. At the age of 17 Smith undertook the study of Commercial Art and Painting at the Brunswick Technical School and joined the Victorian Artists Society. In 1940 Smith joined the Australian Army for the remainder of the \"Second World War\". Upon the end of the war, Smith returned to Melbourne and pursued his artistic ambitions. In 1945, a self-portrait painted on an army canvas was runner-up for the Archibald Prize. In 1956 Smith had his work shown in the Macquarie Galleries, Sydney, during the \"Direction\" exhibition. The success of this exhibition led to Smith's work being included in the 1963 exhibition of Australian art shown at the Tate Gallery in London. Whilst in London in 1963, Smith gained further international recognition after winning the Helena Rubenstein Art Award. In 1970 Smith won the Archibald again for his portrait of Sydney architect Neville Gruzman.\n\nSmith's 3rd winning 1981 portraiture of the Archibald Prize caused a controversy within the art world. In 1975 John Bloomfield's winning entry was disqualified due to his portraiture of Tim Burstall being painted from a photograph. It is a condition of entry that all portraits be painted from life rather than interpretations of photographs. Bloomfield asserted that Smith's portraiture of Rudy Komon resembled a photograph taken of the subject in 1974 and hence in breach of the competition's requirements. Bloomfield threatened legal action to prevent the prize being awarded to Smith. The controversy subsided when gallery director/art dealer Komon came to Smith's defence and said he had sat for Smith many times over the previous twenty-one years.\n\n\n"}

Her father, who died when she was six, was a bookbinder. He produced a newspaper entitled \"The Southern Worker and Labour and Socialist Journal\", which was influenced by the October Russian Revolution, and the paper published his translations of works by Lenin and Trotsky. Her mother joined the Co-operative Party. Melita was educated at Itchen Secondary School, becoming school captain in 1928. She then went on to study Latin and Logic at the University College of Southampton, before dropping out after a year and moving to London to get a job.\n\nFrom 1932, Sirnis worked as a secretary with the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association. Towards the end of 1935, she married Hilary Nussbaum, who was of Russian descent (he later changed his name to Norwood), a chemistry teacher, teachers' trades union official, and lifelong communist. After the Independent Labour Party (ILP), of which she had become a member earlier in the decade, splintered in 1936, Melita Norwood joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). The UK authorities were not aware of her party affiliation until very much later. The previous year, she was recommended to the NKVD (forerunner of the KGB) by Andrew Rothstein, a leading member of the CPGB, and became a full agent in 1937. In the same year, Norwood and her husband purchased a semi-detached house in the south London suburb of Bexleyheath; there they led an apparently unremarkable life together, and Melita Norwood would continue to live there until she was 90.\n\nNorwood’s NKVD espionage career began in the mid-1930s as a member of the Woolwich Spy ring in London. Three of its members were arrested in January 1938 and sentenced to between three and six years in prison, but Melita Norwood was not then detained. Meanwhile, a wave of purges in Moscow led the NKVD to cut back on its overseas espionage activities, and Norwood's new Soviet employers became the GRU, the Military Overseas Intelligence Service of the Soviet Union. Her Soviet handlers gave her a succession of different code names, the last being \"Agent Hola\".\n\nHer position as secretary to G.L. Bailey, head of a department at the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association, enabled Norwood to pass her Soviet handlers material relating to the British atomic weapons project, known at the time by the innocuous name of Tube Alloys. Bailey was on an advisory committee to Tube Alloys. According to Jeremy Bernstein, Bailey was \"warned about Norwood’s political associations and was careful not to reveal anything to her.\"\n\nIn 1958 she was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.\n\nThe British security services eventually identified Norwood as a security risk in 1965, but refrained from questioning her in order to avoid disclosing their methods. She retired in 1972. Her husband died in 1986, and Norwood said in 1999 that he had disapproved of her activities as an agent. Her neighbours in Bexleyheath, while aware of her left-wing beliefs, reacted with astonishment, as did her daughter, when she was unmasked as a spy in 1999.\n\nNorwood's espionage activities were first publicly revealed by former KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin, in the book \"The Mitrokhin Archive: The K.G.B. in Europe and the West\" (1999), co-written by the historian Christopher Andrew. Mitrokhin defected in 1992, giving the British authorities six trunk loads of KGB files. Norwood was well known to be a communist sympathiser but a separate report in 1999 stated that British intelligence became aware of her significance only after Mitrokhin's defection; to protect other investigations it was then decided not to prosecute her. Some have questioned the validity of evidence from the Mitrokhin archive. In the event, Norwood was never charged with an offence and died in 2005.\n\nA communist, Melita Norwood said she gained no material benefits from her spying activities. In a statement at the time of her exposure, she said, \"I did what I did, not to make money, but to help prevent the defeat of a new system which had, at great cost, given ordinary people food and fares which they could afford, a good education and a health service\". While she said she did not generally \"agree with spying against one's country\", she had hoped her actions would help \"Russia to keep abreast of Britain, America and Germany\". In 2014, newly released files from the Mitrokhin archive suggested that Norwood was more highly valued by the KGB than the Cambridge Five.\n\n\"Red Joan\" is a 2018 film very loosely inspired by Norwood's life, starring Judi Dench and Sophie Cookson. It was directed by Trevor Nunn, and produced by David Parfitt, with a screenplay by Lindsay Shapero. The film was shot in the UK. It premiered at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2129480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2129480", "title": "Ashford Castle", "text": "Ashford Castle\n\nAshford Castle is a medieval and Victorian castle that has been expanded over the centuries and turned into a five star luxury hotel near Cong on the Mayo-Galway border, on the shore of Lough Corrib in Ireland. It is a member of the Leading Hotels of the World organisation and was previously owned by the Guinness family.\n\nA castle was built on the perimeter of a monastic site in 1228 by the Anglo-Norman House of Burke.\n\nAfter more than three-and-a-half centuries under the de Burgos, whose surname became Burke or Bourke, Ashford passed into the hands of a new master, following a fierce battle between the forces of the de Burgos and those of the English official Sir Richard Bingham, Lord President of Connaught, when a truce was agreed. In 1589, the castle fell to Bingham, who added a fortified enclave within its precincts.\n\nDominick Browne, of the Browne family (Baron Oranmore and Browne), received the estate in a Royal Grant in either 1670 or 1678. In 1715, the estate of Ashford was established by the Browne family and a hunting lodge in the style of a 17th-century French chateau was constructed. The double-headed eagles still visible on the roof represent the coat of arms of the Brownes.\n\nIn the late 18th-century a branch of the family inhabited the castle. In the early 19th-century, one Thomas Elwood was agent for the Brownes at Ashford and was recorded as living there in 1814.\n\nThe estate was purchased in 1852 by Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness from the Encumbered Estates' Court. He added two large Victorian style extensions. He also extended the estate to , built new roads and planted thousands of trees. The castle was drawn for Sir William Wilde's book about County Galway. On Sir Benjamin's death in 1868, the estate passed to his son Lord Ardilaun, who expanded the building further in the neogothic style.\n\nLord Ardilaun was an avid gardener who oversaw the development of massive woodlands and rebuilt the entire west wing of the castle, designed by architects James Franklin Fuller and George Ashlin. The new construction connected the early 18th-century part in the east with two de-Burgo-time towers in the west. Battlements were added to the whole castle.\n\nHe also subsidised the operation of several steamboats, the most notable of which was the Lady Eglinton, which plied between the villages of the Upper Lough Corrib region and Galway City, thus opening the area to increased commerce. In a time of agitation by tenant farmers in the Land Wars of the late 19th century, epitomised by the action of tenants at nearby Lough Mask House (home of Captain Charles Boycott), he was considered by many to be an 'improving' landlord. Some of his efforts were unsuccessful, particularly the Cong Canal, also known as 'the Dry Canal', which was built to link Lough Mask and Lough Corrib but was a failure, due to its inability to hold water. Despite such setbacks, the love borne by him and his wife Olive, daughter of The 3rd Earl of Bantry, for the castle and the estate was deep and best epitomised by the fact that, when he was ennobled in 1880, he derived his title from the island of Ardilaun, which formed part of the estate on Lough Corrib.\n\nThe Castle passed to Ardilaun's nephew Ernest Guinness and was later sold in 1939 to Noel Huggard. Noel Huggard opened the estate as a hotel, which became renowned for the provision of its country pursuits, such as angling and shooting. Noel Huggard's parents had been in the hotel business in Waterville, County Kerry, since 1910 and his grand daughters, Louise and Paula, run The Butler Arms Hotel there to this day.\nIn 1951, the film director John Ford came to the west of Ireland to film \"The Quiet Man\", starring John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. The grounds of the castle, as well as nearby Cong, formed the backdrop for much of the action in the film.\nIn more recent years the castle has been used as a set for \"French Court\" in The CW's hit medieval drama \"Reign\". The castle and surrounding grounds figure prominently in the first three seasons of the drama, with the cast and crew returning on a yearly basis to film on the estate.\n\nIn 1970, the castle was bought by John Mulcahy, who oversaw its complete restoration and expansion, doubling its size with the addition of a new wing in the early 1970s, building a golf course and developing the grounds and gardens. In 1985, a group of Irish American investors, which included Chuck Feeney and Tony O'Reilly, purchased Ashford. The Castle was sold by these investors in 2007 for €50 million to Galway-based property investor Gerry Barrett and his family. While some of Barrett's extensive property loans were to be managed by the Irish National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), Ashford was financed by Bank of Scotland (Ireland), who placed the property in receivership in November 2011, though the hotel continued as a going concern, run by the Tifco Hotel Group, an Irish hotel management company. In September 2012, it was voted the best resort in Ireland and the third best in Europe by Condé Nast Traveler.\n\nIn October 2012, the hotel was put up for sale and was valued at around €25 million, half of what Barrett paid in 2007. The hotel currently has 83 bedrooms, six of which are suites. Barret's plan to add another 13 penthouse bedrooms and 30 lodges in the castle grounds has not gone through. In May 2013, the hotel was bought by Red Carnation Hotels, a group which owns several other boutique hotels, for €20 million. The new owner plans a major refurbishment and the sale is expected to preserve the roughly 160 jobs (high season, dropping to 120 in low season) at the property. According to the receiver, Ashford Castle was profitable even during the period of receivership. Niall Rochford, long-time manager of the property, has said that staff accepted a 20% to 30% pay cut to ensure the hotel's survival.\n\nIn January 2014, the new owners acquired neighbouring Lisloughrey Lodge, with plans to add it to the resort. Ashford Castle itself was scheduled to reopen on 14 March after major refurbishment that began in early January.\n\nIn August 2015, Ashford Castle was voted world's best hotel by Virtuoso Travel Week; and in July 2015, third best world hotel by Travel + Leisure magazine, US.\n\nToday, most of the guests come from the United States (60 percent; 30 percent from Ireland; 10 percent from elsewhere), with Californians accounting for the largest share.\n\nThe castle re-opened in April 2015 following major refurbishment. All 820 windows were replaced, a new lead roof installed, and its stonework repointed. Around €47m was spent on restoring the property.\n\nIn its time the castle has played host to many notable guests, including: The Prince of Wales (later King George V) and his Consort, the future Queen Mary; John Lennon; George Harrison; Oscar Wilde (whose father, Sir William Wilde, had an estate adjacent to Ashford, where the writer spent much of his childhood); President Ronald Reagan; Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex; US Senator Ted Kennedy; John Wayne; Maureen O'Hara; Robin Williams; Brad Pitt; Pierce Brosnan; and Prince Rainier III of Monaco and his consort, Princess Grace. Professional golfer Rory McIlroy married Erica Stoll there on April 22nd, 2017.\n\nIn September 2011, Gerry Barrett ordered that electric gates be installed, and subsequently shut, blocking a centuries-old public right of way over a bridge near the Castle. The road is used daily by families living on the Estate as well as local residents. After a letter to Castle management asking for the right of way to be re-established was ignored, a group of 150 concerned locals and Ashford residents protested against the blocking of the right of way. The group was joined by local councillors and Éamon Ó Cuív, T.D.. Barrett had earlier attempted to block the protest by taking out a High Court injunction.\n\n"}
{"id": "2129483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2129483", "title": "Marius de Romanus", "text": "Marius de Romanus\n\nMarius de Romanus is a fictional character in \"The Vampire Chronicles\" novels written by Anne Rice. He is the primary character in the novel \"Blood and Gold\".\n\nMarius de Romanus was born in 30 BC in Rome. He was an illegitimate child of a Roman patrician and a Celtic slave from the land of Gaul. In his mortal years, he travelled the Empire and much of the known world compiling a travelogue/history of the world. Contrary to his appearance in the movie \"Queen of the Damned\" (in which he was portrayed by Vincent Perez), he has white-blonde hair curled at the shoulders and cobalt blue eyes. Due to his age, his skin is often described as being as pale and hard as white marble; to seem \"normal\" to mortals, he often applies salves and oils to his skin as stated in \"Blood and Gold\".\n\nWhen he was approximately 40 years old, he was abducted by druids who followed the religion of the Gods of the Groves. Marius was taken to the Grove where he was made into a vampire by the God of the Grove just before the yearly Feast of Samhain. He was instructed by the god to go and try, by any means possible, to find out why vampires all over the world (and the god himself) had been burned or destroyed, even though they had not been exposed to fire or the sun. Marius traveled to Egypt and became the caretaker of the original two vampires, Akasha and Enkil, Those Who Must Be Kept.\n\nMarius has lived in many different places in his two thousand years of life. He lived in Antioch with Pandora for two centuries after becoming the caretaker of Those Who Must Be Kept. After separating from Pandora, he moved to Rome where he had the silent companionship of Avicus and Mael. He went into a coma-like sleep for \"far more than half a century\" before he was awakened by Avicus and Mael and the three set sail for Constantinople. It was there he came to know Zenobia. They lived there for a very short while before Marius went off on his own and visited many places while drifting through time before going into the ground again in the year 1200 AD.\n\nHe awoke again in 1482 and visited Rome and Florence briefly before settling in Venice as a rich, eccentric gentleman who painted for his own pleasure. Here, he opened a home for neglected and abused boys who had talent, fell in love with the Venetian courtesan Bianca Solderini, found the mortal Armand. In 1499, the Children of Darkness (led by Santino) destroyed his house, severely injured Marius, and took Armand (whom he had made a vampire by this time). After the ordeal, Marius and Bianca (who helped him in his recovery and whom he made a vampire to aid him), lived very briefly in many northern Europe towns before they settled for a while in Dresden. Here Marius found Pandora and begged her in vain to leave her companion, Arjun, and return to him. It was also here that Bianca left him after she heard Marius tell Pandora he would send her away if Pandora would be with him again. The last known places where Marius lived and kept the divine vampire parents was on an island in the Aegean Sea; in a large, bustling city in the early part of the 1900s; and in an unspecified, icy region of the far north in a secluded, underground dwelling. After the events of \"The Queen of the Damned\" (after living on the 'Night Island' in Miami), it is revealed in the novel \"Merrick\", that Marius and Pandora had reunited in New Orleans. After New Orleans, in the novel \"Blood and Gold\", Marius is living in a modern house in Stockholm with Daniel Molloy.\n\nMarius is an exceptionally sagacious, wise and optimistic vampire. He is one of the oldest known to still survive, a true Child of the Millennia. Because he has drunk so often from the vampire queen Akasha from whom the vampiric life fount originated, he is immensely powerful and possesses a number of advanced powers: with his mind, he can ignite objects (pyrokinesis-the \"Fire Gift\"), has the ability to fly (the \"Cloud Gift\"), very strong telekinesis, and can move with such speed that only other powerful blood drinkers are able to track his movements. He can read minds with ease and can block his own mind from being read by using the \"Mind Gift\". It is also implied in \"Blood and Gold\" that he has the ability to hypnotize/put mortals under his thrall (the \"Spell Gift\"). Another ability he possesses is the \"Killing Gift\" (killing by using telekinetic pressure/force). He has a great passion for the arts and is a master painter and great scholar. He loves to read and to write. Marius' interests include all manner of intellectual and artistic pursuits. He is bisexual, having had both male (e.g., Armand, Botticelli, Avicus) and female (e.g., Pandora, Akasha, Zenobia, Bianca) lovers.\n\nMarius's fledglings include (in chronological order): Pandora, Armand, Bianca Solderini, Sybelle and Benji. The last two were made for Armand. The movie \"Queen of the Damned\" stated that Marius made Lestat into a vampire, but it was Magnus that created Lestat in the novel \"The Vampire Lestat\".\n\nMarius claims to have loved many over the course of his long life. His greatest loves as he claims them are: Pandora, Armand, Akasha, Bianca Solderini, Lestat, Zenobia and Botticelli. He has, however, lost both of his two greatest loves, Pandora and Armand. Pandora due to his temper and pride, and Armand's due to the drastic religion-driven actions of a Roman vampire, Santino. Marius does say however, that he sees Pandora and Armand \"often\".\n\nIn the musical \"\", Marius was portrayed by Michael Genet.\n"}

His family, of Catholic peasant stock, moved to Augsburg when Egk was six. He studied at a Benedictine Gymnasium (academic high school) and entered the municipal conservatory. Egk demonstrated talents as a composer, graphic artist, and writer, and he moved first to Frankfurt to improve his piano talents and then, in 1921, to Munich. There, working as a theater composer and playing in the pit, he married Elizabeth Karl, a violinist. He derived his pen name \"Egk\" from his wife's initials: \"Elisabeth, geborne Karl\" (Elisabeth, née Karl). His only son, Titus, was born in 1924.\n\nEgk moved to Berlin in 1928, meeting composers Arnold Schoenberg and Hanns Eisler. He intended to become a cinema composer and accompanied silent films. When radio broadcasting became available to the public, Egk immediately realised its importance as a mass medium and developed operas and radio plays. He was introduced to Hans Fleisch, an important radio executive (also Paul Hindemith's brother-in-law and a Jew), by composer Kurt Weill. He received his first commission for broadcasting from Fleisch's company.\n\nHe returned to Munich in 1929 to work for the local radio station and settled in Lochham, a suburb. He became associated with musicians Fritz Büchtger, Karl Marx, and especially, Carl Orff, whom he had met in 1921. His music of the period shows a debt to the compositional style of Igor Stravinsky. He also became friends with new-music conductor Hermann Scherchen and the owners of the music publisher, Schott Music in Mainz. His career as a composer took off with the premiere of his radio opera, \"Columbus\", in July 1933 (staged in April 1934).\n\nAny composer working in Germany at the time had to deal with the Nazi regime coming to power in 1933. Michael H. Kater, Professor of German studies at York University labels Egk \"The Enigmatic Opportunist\" in his portrait of \"Eight German Composers of the Nazi Era\", and by far the most extensive evaluation of the composer's wartime connections in English (Kater, 30). As a German of Catholic heritage, Egk was in no danger of falling into disfavor with the regime's racial policies; rather, the professional hardships for Jewish composers and others created opportunities for him. Egk's contact with Scherchen soon lapsed, and the composer developed a complicated relationship as well as a professional rivalry with Orff, whose works ultimately found more lasting success.\n\nInitially, Munich's cultural administrators had doubts about the compatibility of Egk's Stravinskian style with a Nazi audience, and he encountered difficulty with Munich's representative for Alfred Rosenberg's \"Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur\" (Militant League for German Culture), Paul Ehlers.\n\nIn 1935, he premiered his first opera \"Die Zaubergeige\" (\"The Magic Violin\") in Frankfurt am Main. The work channeled Bavarian folksong and a diatonic idiom far less modernist than his earlier, more angular \"Columbus\". This opera therefore matched Nazi artistic guidelines prescribing folk elements as being close to the people. Swiss composer Heinrich Sutermeister saw the stylistic change as \"opportunistic.\" The success of the work led to a commission for ballet music related to the 1936 Summer Olympics (for which he received a gold medal in the Art Competition) and his appointment as conductor of the Berlin State Opera – a position he held until 1941. Egk's protector in Berlin was Heinz Tietjen, director of the Prussian state theaters and artistic director of the Bayreuth Festival.\n\nNovember 1938 saw the première of his opera \"Peer Gynt\" based on Henrik Ibsen's play. Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels wrote in his diary on 1 February 1939: \"I am very enthusiastic and so is the Führer. A new discovery for the both of us\". Oddly enough, Egk had returned to his more Stravinskian style in the work. More conservative critics found elements in the plot threatening to Nazi ideals of martial grandeur, and they also had difficulties with the reworking of the Nordic plot. One possible interpretation of the event lies in an argument Hitler had with his lieutenant Göring, who had warned Hitler not to go to the opera, \"because none of your favorite singers were in it.\" It has been credibly suggested that Hitler and Goebbels decided to \"like\" the opera as a \"taunt\" to Göring for having the audacity to tell Hitler what he could and could not see (Kater 10 and accompanying footnotes, also an oral history from Viennese composer Gottfried von Einem, Vienna, Nov. 30, 1994).\n\nAs the thirties wore on, Egk was asked, or perhaps commanded, to make official pronouncements about German music, and he received a large commission (never fulfilled) for a large scale opera on Nazi themes. His next major work was the ballet \"Joan von Zarissa\" in 1940. In the following decade, it was common to pair the work with Orff's \"Carmina Burana\". In general, Egk's music found much more success in Berlin, and Orff lost to Egk in the prize surrounding the Olympic games composition. Unlike Egk, who enjoyed regular income from his artistic directorship, Orff was also self-employed and much impoverished. This exposed Egk to attack from Orff's partisans, though Egk and his wife continued to see Orff socially. These rivalries impinged on the credibility of witnesses in Egk's trial after the war. From 1941 to 1945 Egk was the leader of the Composer division (\"\") in the State-Approved Society for the Exploitation of Musical Performing Rights (German: ; STAGMA) which was then under the control of the Nazi Reichsmusikkammer (Reich Music Chamber).\n\nEgk never joined the Nazi party and was exonerated in denazification tribunals held in 1947, but the trials were fraught with inaccuracies, including accounts of involvement with the Austrian resistance movement that were highly dubious. Among Egk's defenders were Gottfried von Einem and composer Boris Blacher. Initially his Nazi affiliations were held against him, though only briefly. There are various interpretations regarding the extent of his collaboration:\n\n\nThe truth is probably somewhere in the middle (Kater, 22).\n\nHis major career began after the war. In Germany, Egk has been dubbed \"Komponist des Wiederaufbaus\" (\"composer of the reconstruction\", which followed World War II). Besides being a conductor and composer, he was head of the Berlin Musikhochschule (1950–1952) and important figure of the GEMA since 1950; he was also the first German president of the Confédération Internationale des Sociétés d'Auteurs et Compositeurs (CISAC). In 1954 he became conductor of the Bavarian State Opera with a 20-year contract.\n\nHis later years saw a constant string of premieres at major European festivals, beginning with \"Irische Legende\" in 1955, conducted by George Szell and featuring Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. His opera \"Die Verlobung in San Domingo\" opened the National Theatre Munich in 1963 and features a libretto by Heinrich von Kleist, pleading for racial tolerance. His late works, however, were almost exclusively instrumental. Exceptional among them are works for winds, including the Divertissement for Ten Wind Instruments (1974) and the Five Pieces for Wind Quintet (1975).\n\nEgk died on 10 July 1983 in Inning am Ammersee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He played in the major leagues from 1981 through 1992, and in Japan in 1993. His father, Brook Wallace Jacoby Sr., played in the Philadelphia Phillies organization in 1956.\n\nJacoby was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 7th round of the 1979 amateur draft. He played in the Braves' minor league system for five years, until being traded to the Cleveland Indians in 1983 along with Brett Butler and Rick Behenna for Cleveland pitcher Len Barker.\n\nJacoby had limited playing time in Atlanta in 1981 and 1983, only for a total of 15 games played. 1984 was his first full major league season; he finished the year with a .264 batting average, 116 hits, and seven home runs. All his statistics would improve in 1985; batting average to .274, 166 hits, 20 home runs, and a career high 87 RBI.\n\n1986 was a landmark year for Jacoby, as he earned his first All-Star Game appearance. While his statistics only improved slightly over 1985 (his average went up to .288 and 168 hits, with fewer home runs and RBI - and more strike outs).\n\nIn 1987 Jacoby batted .300 and had a career high 32 home runs. In addition, he lowered his number of strikeouts to only 73. Jacoby's best season was one of only a few bright spots for a Cleveland team that finished with a record of 61-101. The team had such a hard time scoring runs that Jacoby had only 69 RBI, despite his 32 home runs.\n\nJacoby went into a slump in 1988, where he hit .241 and his offensive production on all levels decreased. 1989 would show a small improvement over the prior year, as he raised his average to .272 and increased his offensive production. Jacoby once again showed improvement in 1990, as his average was .293 and also had his lowest number of strikeouts (58) and earned his second All-Star appearance.\n\nIn 1990, Jacoby and Dave Parker were chosen for the 1990 All Star Game. While neither got much field time during the game, Jacoby and Parker formed a friendship that continues to this day. Jacoby and Parker meet once a year for a fishing trip in Wisconsin.\n\n1991 would turn out to be Jacoby's last full season. He suffered from an elbow injury, and in the middle of the year was traded to the Oakland Athletics for Lee Tinsley. In total, he hit .224 with only 94 hits and four home runs.\n\nIt was not long before Jacoby came back to Cleveland. He became a free agent after 1991, and signed with the Indians in 1992. Although he was signed to back-up starting third baseman Jim Thome, Thome broke his wrist and Jacoby took over the starting job. Sinking to career lows in hits, home runs, and RBIs, he was let go by the Indians at the end of the season.\n\nJacoby was announced as the hitting coach for the Toronto Blue Jays on November 17, 2014. Prior to working with the Jays, Jacoby served as the major league hitting coach for the Cincinnati Reds for seven seasons. On May 4, 2015, MLB announced that Jacoby had been suspended for 14 days without pay due to his conduct toward the umpiring crew on April 29, after a game against the Boston Red Sox.

A sentence can be viewed as expressing a proposition, something that \"must\" be true or false. The restriction of having no free variables is needed to make sure that sentences can have concrete, fixed truth values: As the free variables of a (general) formula can range over several values, the truth value of such a formula may vary.\n\nSentences without any logical connectives or quantifiers in them are known as atomic sentences; by analogy to atomic formula. Sentences are then built up out of atomic formulas by applying connectives and quantifiers.\n\nA set of sentences is called a theory; thus, individual sentences may be called theorems. To properly evaluate the truth (or falsehood) of a sentence, one must make reference to an interpretation of the theory. For first-order theories, interpretations are commonly called structures. Given a structure or interpretation, a sentence will have a fixed truth value. A theory is satisfiable when it is possible to present an interpretation in which all of its sentences are true. The study of algorithms to automatically discover interpretations of theories that render all sentences as being true is known as the satisfiability modulo theories problem.\n\nThe following example in first-order logic\n\nis a sentence, because of the presence of the free variable \"y\". In the structure of the real numbers, this formula is true if we substitute (arbitrarily) \"y\" = 2, but is false if \"y\" = –2. \n\nIt is the presence of a free variable, rather than the inconstant truth value, that is important; for example, even in the structure of the complex numbers, where the statement is always true, it is still not considered a sentence.

It is related to, but not identical with, the species-area curve. \n\nThe species discovery curve will necessarily be increasing, and will normally be negatively accelerated (that is, its rate of increase will slow down). Plotting the curve gives a way of estimating the number of additional species that will be discovered with further effort. This is usually done by fitting some kind of functional form to the curve, either by eye or by using non-linear regression techniques. Commonly used functional forms include the logarithmic function and the negative exponential function. The advantage of the negative exponential function is that it tends to an asymptote which equals the number of species that would be discovered if infinite effort is expended. However, some theoretical approaches imply that the logarithmic curve may be more appropriate, implying that though species discovery will slow down with increasing effort, it will never entirely cease, so there is no asymptote, and if infinite effort was expended, an infinite number of species would be discovered. \n\nThe first theoretical investigation of the species-discovery process was in a classic paper by Fisher, Corbet and Williams (1943), which was based on a large collection of butterflies made in Malaya. Theoretical statistical work on the problem continues, see for example the recent paper by Chao and Shen (2004). The theory is linked to that of Zipf's law.\n\nThe same approach is used in many other fields. For example, in ethology, it can be applied to the number of distinct fixed action patterns that will be discovered as a function of cumulative effort studying the behaviour of a species of animal; in molecular genetics it is now being applied to the number of distinct genes that are discovered; and in literary studies, it can be used to estimate the total vocabulary of a writer from the given sample of his or her recorded works (see Efron & Thisted, 1976).\n\n"}

In the early 14th century the Teutonic Knights invaded and annexed the region from Poland into their monastic state, which already included historical Prussia, located east of the region. As a result of the Teutonic rule, in German terminology the name of Prussia was also extended to annexed Polish lands like Gdańsk/Eastern Pomerania, although it was not inhabited by Baltic Prussians but Slavic Poles. After the area was reintegrated with Poland in 1466 both names were in use: \"Pomerania\" in the name of the Pomeranian Voivodeship and \"Prussia\" in the name of the province of Royal Prussia, which, however, also included other voivodeships with the historical areas of Chełmno Land, Michałów Land, Pomesania and Pogesania. After the Partitions of Poland the area was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia and formed part of the newly established province of West Prussia, and the name \"Pomerania\" was not used by Prussian or German authorities in relation to this region.\nThe area was termed Polish Pomerania (\"Polskie Pomorze\") since at least the 18th century to distinguish it from Hither and Farther Pomerania, then outside of Polish rule. In the late 19th century this term was used in order to stress Polish claims to that area that was then ruled by the German Kingdom of Prussia.\n\nFollowing World War I and Poland's independence, much of this area became part of the new Second Polish Republic and was organized into the Pomeranian Voivodeship.

Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748 (2005), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled, 7–2, that a town and its police department could not be sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for failing to enforce a restraining order, which had led to the murder of a woman's three children by her estranged husband.\n\nDuring divorce proceedings, Jessica Lenahan-Gonzales, a resident of Castle Rock, Colorado, obtained a permanent restraining order against her husband Simon, who had been stalking her, on June 4, 1999, requiring him to remain at least from her and her four children (son Jesse, who is not Simon's biological child, and daughters Rebecca, Katherine, and Leslie) except during specified visitation time. On June 22, at approximately 5:15 pm, Simon took possession of his three daughters in violation of the order. Jessica called the police at approximately 7:30 pm, 8:30 pm, and 10:10 pm on June 22, and 12:15 am on June 23, and visited the police station in person at 12:40 am on June 23. However, since she from time to time had allowed Simon to take the children at various hours, the police took no action, despite Simon having called Jessica prior to her second police call and informing her that he had the daughters with him at an amusement park in Denver, Colorado. At approximately 3:20 am on June 23, Simon appeared at the Castle Rock police station and was killed in a shoot-out with the officers. A search of his vehicle revealed the corpses of the three daughters, whom it has been assumed he killed prior to his arrival.\n\nGonzales filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against Castle Rock, Colorado, its police department, and the three individual police officers with whom she had spoken under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming a federally protected property interest in enforcement of the restraining order and alleging \"an official policy or custom of failing to respond properly to complaints of restraining order violations.\" A motion to dismiss the case was granted, and Gonzales appealed to the Denver, Colorado Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. A panel of that court rejected Gonzales's substantive due process claim but found a procedural due process claim; an en banc rehearing reached the same conclusion. The court also affirmed the finding that the three individual officers had qualified immunity and as such could not be sued.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Tenth Circuit's decision, reinstating the District Court's order of dismissal. The Court's majority opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia held that enforcement of the restraining order was not mandatory under Colorado law; were a mandate for enforcement to exist, it would not create an individual right to enforcement that could be considered a protected entitlement under the precedent of \"Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth\"; and even if there were a protected individual entitlement to enforcement of a restraining order, such entitlement would have no monetary value and hence would not count as property for the Due Process Clause.\n\nJustice David Souter wrote a concurring opinion, using the reasoning that enforcement of a restraining order is a process, not the interest protected by the process, and that there is not due process protection for processes.\n\nJustice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion, in which he wrote that with respect to whether or not an arrest was mandatory under Colorado law, the court should either have deferred to the 10th Circuit court's finding that it was or else certified the question to the Colorado Supreme Court rather than decide the issue itself. He went on to write that the law created a statutory guarantee of enforcement, which is an individual benefit and constitutes a protected property interest under \"Roth,\" rejecting the court's use of \"O'Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center\" to require a monetary value and the concurrence's distinction between enforcement of the restraining order (the violator's arrest) and the benefit of enforcement (safety from the violator).\n\nIn 2011, the case came before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a commission composed of representatives from the members of Organization of American States (the United States is a full member by its ratification of the charter document, which is a treaty itself) which found that \"the state failed to act with due diligence to protect Jessica Lenahan and (her daughters) Leslie, Katheryn and Rebecca Gonzales from domestic violence, which violated the state’s obligation not to discriminate and to provide for equal protection before the law.\" The Commission also said that \"the failure of the United States to adequately organize its state structure to protect (the Gonzales girls) from domestic violence was discriminatory and constituted a violation of their right to life.\"\n\nAs this case is the latest in a line of high-profile cases, such as \"DeShaney v. Winnebago County\", in which lawsuits against governmental entities for failure to prevent harm to an individual were dismissed, it has also been used by gun rights advocates in the United States to add additional weight to the self-defense argument for private gun ownership.\n\nThe National Organization for Women has argued the Supreme Court's decision reduced the utility of restraining orders and \"effectively gives law enforcement a green light to ignore restraining orders.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2129591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2129591", "title": "Inverse dynamics", "text": "Inverse dynamics\n\nInverse dynamics is an inverse problem. It commonly refers to either inverse rigid body dynamics or inverse structural dynamics. Inverse rigid-body dynamics is a method for computing forces and/or moments of force (torques) based on the kinematics (motion) of a body and the body's inertial properties (mass and moment of inertia). Typically it uses link-segment models to represent the mechanical behaviour of interconnected segments, such as the limbs of humans, animals or robots, where given the kinematics of the various parts, inverse dynamics derives the minimum forces and moments responsible for the individual movements. In practice, inverse dynamics computes these internal moments and forces from measurements of the motion of limbs and external forces such as ground reaction forces, under a special set of assumptions.\n\nThe fields of robotics and biomechanics constitute the major application areas for inverse dynamics.\n\nWithin robotics, inverse dynamics algorithms are used to calculate the torques that a robot's motors must deliver to make the robot's end-point move in the way prescribed by its current task. The \"inverse dynamics problem\" in Robotics Engineering was solved by Eduardo Bayo in 1987. This solution calculates how each of the numerous electric motors that control a robot arm must move to produce a particular action. Humans can perform very complicated and precise movements, such as controlling the tip of a fishing rod well enough to cast the bait accurately. Before the arm moves, the brain calculates the necessary movement of each muscle involved and tells the muscles what to do as the arm swings. In the case of a robot arm, the \"muscles\" are the electric motors which must turn by a given amount at a given moment. Each motor must be supplied with just the right amount of electric current, at just the right time. Researchers can predict the motion of a robot arm if they know how the motors will move. This is known as the forward dynamics problem. Until this discovery, they had not been able to work backwards to calculate the movements of the motors required to generate a particular complicated motion., Bayo's work began with the application of frequency-domain methods to the inverse dynamics of single-link flexible robots. This approach yielded non-causal exact solutions due to the right-half plane zeros in the hub-torque-to-tip transfer functions. Extending this method to the nonlinear multi-flexible-link case was of particular importance to robotics. When combined with passive joint control in a collaborative effort with a control group, Bayo's inverse dynamics approach led to exponentially stable tip-tracking control for flexible multi-link robots.\n\nSimilarly, inverse dynamics in biomechanics computes the net turning effect of all the anatomical structures across a joint, in particular the muscles and ligaments, necessary to produce the observed motions of the joint. These moments of force may then be used to compute the amount of mechanical work performed by that moment of force. Each moment of force can perform positive work to increase the speed and/or height of the body or perform negative work to decrease the speed and/or height of the body. The equations of motion necessary for these computations are based on Newtonian mechanics, specifically the Newton–Euler equations of:\n\nThese equations mathematically model the behaviour of a limb in terms of a knowledge domain-independent, link-segment model, such as idealized solids of revolution or a skeleton with fixed-length limbs and perfect pivot joints. From these equations, inverse dynamics derives the torque (moment) level at each joint based on the movement of the attached limb or limbs affected by the joint. This process used to derive the joint moments is known as inverse dynamics because it reverses the forward dynamics equations of motion, the set of differential equations which yield the position and angle trajectories of the idealized skeleton's limbs from the accelerations and forces applied.\n\nFrom joint moments, a biomechanist could infer muscle forces that would lead to those moments based on a model of bone and muscle attachments, etc., thereby estimating muscle activation from kinematic motion.\n\nCorrectly computing force (or moment) values from inverse dynamics can be challenging because external forces (e.g., ground contact forces) affect motion but are not directly observable from the kinematic motion. In addition, co-activation of muscles can lead\nto a family of solutions which are not distinguishable from the kinematic motion's characteristics. Furthermore, closed kinematic chains, such as swinging a bat or shooting a hockey puck, require the measurement of internal forces (in the bat or stick) be made before shoulder, elbow or wrist moments and forces can be derived.\n\n\n\n"}

During his short career, he directed seven Broadway productions and appeared in 36 Broadway plays., his first \"If I Were King\" at the Shubert Theatre, 1916 and his last \"Time Out For Ginger\", 1953, at the Lyceum Theatre.. Loeb also was co-author of the film adaptation of \"Room Service\" starring the Marx Brothers, Loeb had previously appeared in the hit Broadway show of the same name which had a 500 performance run at Broadway's Cort Theatre. His stage career gained strength in the early 1920s when he became associated with the newly formed Theatre Guild in New York City. His stage work lessened in the 1930s, while he worked with Actors' Equity Association. (It is his work with Equity that is thought to have prompted the charges of Communist leanings.)\n\nIn 1948, Loeb portrayed the role of Jake Goldberg on Broadway in Gertrude Berg's play \"Me and Molly\" which was based on Berg's long-running radio show \"The Goldbergs\". After the play, he reprised the role on the television adaptation of \"The Goldbergs\" on CBS. Loeb became a viewer favorite as the exasperated, loving husband Jake to Berg's meddlesome, bighearted Molly Goldberg.\n\nIn June 1950, \"Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television\", named Loeb as a Communist. Loeb denied being a Communist, but the sponsors of \"The Goldbergs\", General Foods, insisted that he be dropped from the show's cast due to his \"controversiality\". Berg (who had created the show and owned it on both radio and television) refused to fire Loeb, but Loeb soon resigned, accepting a settlement which was estimated at $40,000 ($ today).\n\nLoeb's last acting job was in the 1953 Broadway production of \"Time Out for Ginger\" and its subsequent Chicago production in 1954.\n\nIn his memoirs, \"Inside Out\", blacklisted screenwriter Walter Bernstein describes Loeb as being disconsolate and depressed as a result of the blacklisting. Loeb was the sole support of a mentally disturbed son, and was burdened with financial problems. Bernstein was part of a circle of friends including Zero Mostel, and said \"I never saw Loeb smile, even when Zero was at his hilarious best.\"\n\nThe following year Loeb committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills in the Taft Hotel in midtown Manhattan on September 1, 1955. No note was found. Loeb was buried in Mount Sinai Cemetery in his native Philadelphia.\n\nLoeb's suicide was reflected in the character Hecky Brown, played by his real-life friend Zero Mostel (himself a blacklisted performer), in \"The Front\" (1976), Martin Ritt's film examining the Hollywood blacklist (also starring Woody Allen). The screenplay of the movie was written by Walter Bernstein, another blacklisted friend.\n\nLoeb's case is also noted in the Philip Roth novel \"I Married a Communist\".\nThe American Academy of Dramatic Arts—where Loeb was an instructor—awards an annual scholarship in his memory. Equity briefly issued the Philip Loeb Humanitarian Award.\n\n"}

It occupies a prominent site in Bishopsgate, in the City of London financial district, and is set to stand tall with 62 storeys. The project replaces an earlier plan for a tower named The Pinnacle, on which construction was started in 2008 but suspended in 2012 following the Great Recession, with only the concrete core of the first seven storeys. The structure was later subjected to a re-design, out of which it became known by its postal address, 22 Bishopsgate.\n\nUnder the original plans, The Pinnacle was to become the second-tallest building in both the United Kingdom and the European Union after The Shard, also in London. The Economic Development Corporation of Saudi Arabia and its development manager, Arab Investments, which largely funded the construction (investing £500 million in it) in return for a majority stake in the structure. However, the build was put on hold due to a lack of additional funding and letting commitments.\n\nIn 2013 it was reported that a review of the design and construction process, undertaken by original architects Kohn Pedersen Fox, agents CBRE and the developers, had been completed, with the building's \"helter skelter\" style exterior set to be retained. In 2015, the site was sold to a consortium led by Axa Real Estate and a re-design with a simpler exterior, ultimately excluding the costly \"helter skelter\" shape, was submitted for public consultation before application for planning permission.\n\nIn April 2016, it was confirmed that property company Lipton Rogers and its joint venture partner, Axa IM – Real Assets, would complete the £1bn development in 2019. At 278 metres, the building was set to be the tallest in the City of London at that time and, due to potential loss of light to surrounding buildings, there had been objections to the development from several parties. However, City of London granted permission after considering the potential benefits of developing the building including the introduction of more floorspace to the area and the creation of new jobs.\n\nIn 2017, plans were approved which redesigned the building and reduced its height further to 255 m due to concerns that the cranes used for its construction could interfere with the flight paths of the nearby London City Airport. However, these plans were withdrawn after approval was granted for the previous 278-metre design.\n\nThe architects of The Pinnacle were Kohn Pedersen Fox and the developer was the fund management company Union Investment. The height of the tower was initially proposed at , but this was scaled down to following concerns from the Civil Aviation Authority. The revised design included approximately of office space.\n\nThe Bishopsgate Tower, as it was first called, was submitted for planning permission in June 2005 and approved in April 2006. The twisting design of its roof and the curling patterns in the façade were based on various organic forms in nature such as armadillos, mushrooms and seashells, and led to the building being nicknamed \"The Helter Skelter\". The upper floors were to contain restaurants and the highest public viewing platform in the UK.\n\nThe Pinnacle's original design also provided more solar panelling than any other building in the country, with of photovoltaic cells, capable of generating up to 200 kW of electricity. It would also have had a double-layered skin like the nearby gherkin-shaped 30 St Mary Axe, allowing it to respond dynamically to climatic changes and to utilise effective climate control with low energy consumption. To control construction costs, every panel on the tower would be of exactly the same size.\n\nIn August 2006 Keltbray began test-piling on site. Demolition began on the smaller of the two existing buildings in November 2006. In February 2007 it was reported that the Bishopsgate Tower had been purchased by Arab Investments, and that the structure would be renamed as The Pinnacle.\n\nIn May 2007 it was announced that full funding had been secured and that The Pinnacle was likely to be built speculatively. In June 2007 demolition began on Crosby Court, the larger of the two existing buildings on the site.\n\nIn August 2007 Arab Investments signed a pre-construction contract with Multiplex to build the tower.\n\nDemolition of the existing site began in mid-2007. It was scheduled to be completed by February 2008, however this was delayed until April 2008 because of an injunction won in December 2007 by Hiscox, an insurance company based in neighbouring Great St. Helen's. The company complained about noise pollution from the work. The injunction obtained by Hiscox Syndicates & Another against The Pinnacle Ltd & Others in January 2008 afforded protection on three points:\n\nThe injunction was successfully varied at a hearing in June 2008. An application to vary the terms of the injunction in connection with access was granted and a new Order made by the Technology and Construction Court.\n\nAlternative access across the site ensured that access to the car park entrance was maintained whilst demolition above and adjacent to the highway continued.\n\nDemolition was completed by June 2008.\n\nIn late May 2008, a mobile crane and piling rig were on site preparing for construction. It was reported that law firm Davies Arnold Cooper was to take up of office space, and subsequently that the restaurant which was to be at the top of the tower was let. The tower was well under construction, with steel rebar cages already inserted into the ground, which formed part of the piles that would hold the weight of the tower. In November 2008 another piling rig came into use on the site, as well as steel plates for the piles.\n\nBy March 2009 the largest-ever piles in the UK had been laid (the previous record holder was Moor House with foundations 57 m deep, and these were only built to that depth in 2002 to allow Crossrail to eventually pass under it). The piles were sunk 48.5 m below sea level, and 65.5 m below the site (surpassing Moor House's depth by 8.5 m).\n\nIn summer 2009 piling had been completed and workers began excavating deep down, ready to begin constructing the basements. The first crane base was put into place in October 2009.\n\nIn June 2011 Arab Investments announced that they had secured the near £500 million shortfall in the project, meaning that construction work could resume, and by December 2011 the core had reached the sixth floor. A£140 million loan was provided by HSH Nordbank, a lender based in Hamburg, which was subsequently extended three times.\n\nIn March 2012 the project was halted until at least early 2013, due to problems regarding the pre-let. In December 2012 a settlement offered by Arab Investments to contractors Brookfield Multiplex paved the way for construction to resume \"potentially very soon\". However, in February 2013 it was reported that the part-built skyscraper could be demolished and rebuilt from scratch based on a less expensive scheme. The following month it was understood that several architects had submitted bids to re-design The Pinnacle, including Ken Shuttleworth, the co-designer of 30 St Mary Axe.\n\nIn April 2013 it was suggested that The Pinnacle would not restart construction under its original design. However, by December 2013, after an extensive design review, alterations to the interior floor plans were made but the costly exterior was retained with no significant changes.\n\nIn February 2015 the site was acquired by a consortium led by Axa Real Estate in a deal worth £550 million. The building was completely re-designed and a new application for planning permission was submitted in Summer 2015 following consultation. That application was approved in November 2015. The concrete central core of the original design was completely removed by December 2015, and construction of the new building commenced in January 2016.\n\nThe new building, renamed as 22 Bishopsgate, is planned to be tall with 62 storeys. It is estimated the tower will provide approximately of office space and for restaurants, retail outlets and viewing galleries.\n\nDuring the EU Referendum campaign, the developer, Axa, had stated that while they were \"committed to the development\", they may \"revisit the options\" if there was a vote to leave the EU. However, despite the leave vote on 23 June, construction has continued.\n\nIn November 2016, a new planning application was submitted which slightly altered the design of the proposed building, as well as reduced its height by 23 metres and to 59 floors to allow for \"a cleaner, more elegant resolution to the top of the building in the context of air-traffic control constraints\". The application was approved in February 2017. However, these plans were withdrawn, with the developer confirming that the 62-storey, 278 m scheme will be built.\n\n\n"}

Such a tube is more correctly called a 'photoemissive cell' to distinguish it from photovoltaic or photoconductive cells. Phototubes were previously more widely used but are now replaced in many applications by solid state photodetectors. The photomultiplier tube is one of the most sensitive light detectors, and is still widely used in physics research.\n\nPhototubes operate according to the photoelectric effect: Incoming photons strike a photocathode, knocking electrons out of its surface, which are attracted to an anode. Thus current is dependent on the frequency and intensity of incoming photons. Unlike photomultiplier tubes, no amplification takes place, so the current through the device is typically of the order of a few microamperes.\n\nThe light wavelength range over which the device is sensitive depends on the material used for the photoemissive cathode. A caesium-antimony cathode gives a device that is very sensitive in the violet to ultra-violet region with sensitivity falling off to blindness to red light. Caesium on oxidised silver gives a cathode that is most sensitive to infra-red to red light, falling off towards blue, where the sensitivity is low but not zero.\n\nVacuum devices have a near constant anode current for a given level of illumination relative to anode voltage. Gas-filled devices are more sensitive, but the frequency response to modulated illumination falls off at lower frequencies compared to the vacuum devices. The frequency response of vacuum devices is generally limited by the transit time of the electrons from cathode to anode. \n\nOne major application of the phototube was the reading of optical sound tracks for projected films. Phototubes were used in a variety of light-sensing applications until they were superseded by photoresistors and photodiodes.\n"}

He served as United States Senator, the 28th Lieutenant Governor, and as Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives.\n\nSherman is best known for his role in preventing the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, which kept the United States out of the League of Nations.\n\nSherman was born on November 8, 1858 near Piqua in Miami County, Ohio, the son of Nelson Sherman and Maria (Yates) Sherman. A year later, he moved with his parents to McDonough County, Illinois and eight years later, they moved to Grove Township in Jasper County, Illinois.\n\nHe attended the common schools and Lee's Academy in Coles County, and in 1882 earned an LL.B. degree from McKendree University in Lebanon, Illinois. He studied law under Judge Henry Horner and Professor Samuel H. Deneen and was admitted to the bar in Illinois in 1882.\n\nIn 1891, he married Ella M. Crews, who died in 1893. On March 4, 1908, he married Estelle Spitler, who died in 1910.\n\nAfter passing the bar, Sherman involved himself in Illinois politics. He was city attorney for Macomb, Illinois from 1885 to 1887 and a McDonough County judge from 1886 to 1890. In 1890, he entered into the private practice of law in Macomb.\n\nSherman served 4 terms in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1897 to 1905. During his second term in 1899 he was chosen as the 40th Speaker of the House, and in 1901 he became the second Republican to serve two terms in that office, 5th overall. While Speaker, Sherman played an important role in the creation of Western Illinois State Normal School (now Western Illinois University) and was instrumental in the selection of Macomb for its location. Sherman Hall, the main administrative building at Western Illinois University, was renamed after Senator Sherman in 1957.\n\nIn 1904, he ran an unsuccessful bid for Governor of Illinois, but was nominated for the Lieutenant Governor position. He became the 28th Lieutenant Governor of Illinois, serving from 1905 to 1909. As lieutenant governor he was \"ex officio\" president of the Illinois Senate.\n\nIn 1909, he ran for Mayor of Springfield, Illinois, but lost by 300 votes. He served as president of the Illinois state board of administration, public charities, 1909-1913 before returning to the practice of law in Springfield.\n\nAs a delegate to the 1912 Republican National Convention, Sherman supported Theodore Roosevelt, but then worked to prevent the party split that resulted in the Bull Moose party. After the split, he supported the party nominee, William Howard Taft, for president.\n\nIn 1912, Sherman entered the Republican \"advisory\" primary for the United States Senate, challenging incumbent five-term Republican Senator Shelby M. Cullom. Cullom had suffered politically over his support for the other Illinois senator, William Lorimer, who was embroiled in a scandal over alleged bribery in his 1909 election to the Senate. On April 9, Sherman defeated Cullom by 60,000 votes and Cullom withdrew his name from consideration by the General Assembly.\n\nThree months after the primary, the United States Senate invalidated the election of Lorimer and declared the seat vacant. The Illinois Attorney General, William H. Stead determined that the General Assembly had failed to properly elect Lorimer in 1909 and so the Governor could not appoint a replacement. As a result, the General Assembly had two Senate seats to fill.\n\nIn the November 1912 election, the Republicans lost control of the state due to the Republican / Progressive split. But while the Democrats held a plurality of the General Assembly, they did not have a majority. The General Assembly took up the matter of electing the senators on February 1. On March 26, in a compromise arranged by governor Dunne, the General Assembly elected Democrat J. Hamilton Lewis to fill the Cullom seat and chose Sherman to fill the two remaining years of Lorimer's term.\n\nIn 1914, he was elected to a full term, this time by the people of Illinois due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, which he had supported prior to being elected to the Senate.\n\nIn 1916, Sherman made the decision to retire from politics not to run for reelection in 1920, due to his failing hearing, which prevented him from hearing what was said on the Senate floor.\n\nHe served as chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia during the Sixty-sixth Congress.\n\nAs one of the group of senators known as the \"irreconcilables\" or the \"bitter-enders\", Sherman opposed the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles and of U.S. involvement in the League of Nations, and according to Historian Aaron Chandler, played a key role in its defeat. He characterized the treaty as \"humanitarian in purpose, but impracticable in operation\", and believed the league would be weak.\n\nSherman was a nationalist, but not an isolationist. He maintained that the country's interests would be served by maintaining close relations with England and France, and was willing to accept limited obligations to America's wartime allies. He opposed any league that would limit America's sovereignty, and believed that membership in a league of nations with divergent interests would weaken the United States in foreign affairs, by giving equal votes to small, weak countries, and allowing them to join together and dictate foreign policy to the United States, Great Britain, France, and Italy.\n\nSherman was concerned with America's influence in the League. He criticized the provisions of Article 7 that would give to the British Empire, counting its colonies, six votes, while the United States would have only one. He said that \"Great Britain with her diplomatic influence in the Old World much superior to ours could easily secure a majority of the nations to outvote us any time she wished.\" He argued that the large number of predominately Catholic nations in the League were dominated by the Vatican, which would leave the United States beholden to the Pope in foreign affairs. He was convinced that membership in the league would result in the United States paying most of the cost for reconstructing Europe after the war, arguing that the assessments would be based on ability to pay and that \"we would therefore become a perpetual taxpayer for the benefit of Europe.\"\n\nSherman opposed some of the non-league provisions of the treaty. He sharply criticized the Shantung provision of the treaty which transferred German concessions in Shantung to Japan rather than return them to China, saying \"40,000,000 Chinese in Shantung were denied the right of self-determination and delivered to Japan under treaty\" In addition, he criticized the territorial concessions to Poland as insufficient.\n\nHe was one of the 39 senators who joined the \"Round-Robin\" resolution in March 1919, declaring that the peace treaty with Germany should be separated from any proposal for a League of Nations, and vowing to vote against the treaty in its current form.\n\nDuring a vote on amendments to the treaty, after Woodrow Wilson had stated that he would not accept any amendments, Sherman said: \n\nWhen the treaty was voted on by the full Senate with reservations attached, Sherman voted against the Treaty, as did President Wilson's supporters at his urging. After its defeat, Sherman delivered an address he called \"a funeral oration over the defunct remains\" of the treaty, and said it was one of the few times that he found himself in agreement with Wilson.\n\nAfter leaving the Senate, Sherman resumed the practice of law again in Springfield. In 1924 Sherman moved to Daytona Beach, Florida, and continued the practice of law there, also engaging in the investment business. He helped organize the First National Bank of Daytona Beach and served as its president in 1925 and was chairman of its board of directors from 1925 to 1927. Beginning in 1930, when it merged with the Atlantic National Bank of Jacksonville, he was a director at that bank until he retired.\n\nSherman retired from all active business pursuits in 1933. He died in Daytona Beach, Florida, on September 15, 1939, and was interred at Faunce Cemetery in Montrose, Illinois.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2129772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2129772", "title": "The Prince (anthology)", "text": "The Prince (anthology)\n\nThe Prince is a science fiction compilation by Jerry Pournelle and S. M. Stirling. It is part of the CoDominium future history series. \"The Prince\" is a compilation of four previously published novels: \"Falkenberg's Legion\", \"Prince of Mercenaries\", \"Go Tell The Spartans\", and \"Prince of Sparta\". Of the original novels, the first two were written by Pournelle alone; the last two were cowrittten with Stirling. Pages 174–176 of the printed edition are new to the compilation. \"The Prince\" was published by Baen Books in hardcover () in September 2002.\n\nThe title and subject matter of the book are inspired by \"The Prince\" by Niccolò Machiavelli.\n\nThe CoDominium is a formal alliance between the United States and the Soviet Union which holds power over Earth, with a cynically hegemonistic foreign policy toward all the other nations of Earth and Earth's off-world colonies. The action occurs over a period from the 2060s to the 2090s in the CoDominium universe.\n\nHumanity has developed interstellar flight (the Alderson Drive) and has colonized many planets outside the Solar System, simply moving in and setting up shop on some, terraforming others with a not-specified Terraforming Package that transforms an alien world into a planet that supports all Terran life forms, from bacteria to plants to animals to humans. A recurring theme through the stories is the result of the CoDominium’s policy of shipping large numbers of voluntary and involuntary colonists from Earth to the colonized planets. The involuntary colonists cause much trouble, knowing nothing but a welfare state existence in government ghettos (called \"Welfare Islands\"), where drugs, booze and entertainment, paid for by the productive members of society (\"Taxpayers\"), keep them pacified. Shanghaied to the colony worlds by the Bureau of Relocation (\"BuReLock\") in an attempt to keep Earth's population down, they gather in city centers and shanty towns, reverting to their parasitical or criminal lifestyles depending on their personal inclinations.\n\nWhile some convict and involuntary transportees do assimilate into their new planets' societies, most band together against the original colonists of whatever world they end up on. Political parties always form to demand a consumer-oriented welfare state, ostensibly to promote social fairness but with agendas meant to advance the welfare state at the expense of the productive. The welfare state demanded by the influx of Terrans from the Welfare Islands who do not have the concept of \"work\" in their mental universes requires cheap energy, consumer industry, and an unrealistically large tax base. Even without explicit knowledge of the agenda of the socialists, the productive members of each planet's society are outraged by encroachments and banditry forcing them to yield lands or businesses which they have worked hard to establish.\n\nPournelle pays attention to the soldier′s dilemma of being expected to obey orders without regard to the consequences to the people of the colony planets. Pournelle repeatedly discusses the resentment of the CoDominium Navy and Line Marines used to subdue local defiance of CoDominium rule to garner fortunes for Senator Bronson, other Grand Senators, their cronies, and multinational corporations without the opportunity of \"leaving things in working order.\"\n\nFalkenberg's Mercenary Legion is a force in opposition to the policies of Earth's politicians, the Humanity League, and the socialists. Working with Grand Admiral Lermontov, the admiral in command of the CoDominium Space Navy, the Legion acts to suppress the bandits, rebels and insurgents who prey on landowners, and works against corrupt politicians bent on exploiting natural resources on the newly settled planets with very little benefit to the people living on the new planets.\n\nThe saga relates the progress of John Christian Falkenberg from a junior officer in the Line Marines of the CoDominium Navy to a senior Marine colonel. Forced out of the CoDominium Line Marines on a technicality, Falkenberg is a military genius with a flair for the bold and unconventional, often resorting to deception to win battles. The core of Falkenberg's Mercenary Legion is composed of officers and NCOs from the 42nd Line Marine Regiment commanded by Falkenberg before budget cuts caused the regiment to be disestablished, and recruits enlisted from planets on which the Legion fights. Falkenberg's rise through the officer ranks of the CoDominium military and the growth of the Legion's reputation is paired with the decline and fall of the CoDominium.\n\nJohn Christian has a powerful enemy in Grand Senator Adrian Bronson of Earth, who blames him for the death of his grandson and heir while under Falkenberg′s command. Bronson also opposes Grand Admiral Sergei Lermontov, Falkenberg′s mentor and chief of the CoDominium Navy, whose goal is to preserve civilization and freedom within the CoDominium's sphere of influence.\n\nThe weapons and tactics employed are easily recognizable to the modern reader. In Pournelle′s future universe, scientific and technical advances with military implications (which turn out to be virtually all scientific and technical advances) are ruthlessly suppressed by the CoDominium which controls Earth. Also, the expense of importing advanced technology means that cheaper, less advanced alternatives are common. The Mules, donkeys and horses are better vehicles than a truck on a colony world, while a tank or two might be the deciding factor in a campaign. The weapons used by planetary forces and the mercenary units are rifles, machine guns, grenades, mortars and light artillery. A few helicopters are available, but in most situations are vulnerable to man-portable antiaircraft missiles. Unlike the present-day state of military art, it is rare that helicopters can be used as aerial fighting vehicles.\n\n\"Originally published as the novel \"West of Honor\", later incorporated into \"Falkenberg′s Legion\"\n\nFounded by religious zealots, Arrarat′s agrarian society is besieged by well-organized and well-supplied bandit gangs composed mainly of involuntary colonists. The story is told in first-person narrative by just graduated and commissioned Lieutenant Harlan (“Hal”) Slater of the CoDominium Line Marines. Slater and two classmates from the Academy were chosen by John Christian Falkenberg, the youngest captain in the history of the CoDominium Marines, to oversee the transfer of Marines to the planet Arrarat to suppress local unrest.\n\nFalkenberg takes Slater and the group of guardhouse scrapings and ne'er-do-wells he brought to Arrarat and forms the 501st Provisional Battalion to respond to an urgent request from the governor of Arrarat. The governor had requested a regiment of military police (Garrison Marines) and a destroyer for fire support to deal with the numerous lawless bands in control of much of the countryside. The superannuated CoDominium officers stationed on the planet, all Garrison Marines, fear the havoc unruly Line Marines will create in the capital city of Harmony.\n\nTo avoid this, Falkenberg elects to take the Line Marines upriver to the bandit-occupied Fort Beersheba, an outpost built by the Line Marine regiment that had initially pacified the planet. Slater is tasked with taking and holding Fort Beersheba. In a daring night assault using one company of airlifted troops, Slater takes the fort while Falkenberg marches the remainder of the newly organized 501st Provisional Battalion up the Jordan River valley to relieve him. Holding the fort is not easy; though disorganized and untrained, the enemy outnumbers Slater′s A Company almost ten to one and has mortars and machine guns as well as smallarms. Although A Company takes heavy casualties, Slater holds his position long enough to delay the bandits until Falkenberg arrives with heavy artillery to break the siege. Slater and A Company are decorated for their valiant stand at Fort Beersheba.\n\nAfter establishing the fort as a base, Slater and the other officers watch the restless and combat-eager Marines suffer more and more from \"le cafard\", aka “the Bug,” a kind of military cabin fever frequently endured by soldiers of the French Foreign Legion who are the ancestors of the CoDominium Line Marines. Partly to combat this growing problem, Falkenberg and Colonel Harrington, head of Arrarat's small permanent Marine garrison, urge the planetary governor to move against the bandits tyrannizing the farmers of the Jordan Valley, who simply want to farm and be left alone by both the central government and the bandit gangs. Governor Swale refuses, pleading lack of resources - and his previous treaties with the bandit \"governments\" in Arrarat's interior farming country which compel the farmers to turn over most of what they grow as \"taxes\" and sell their grain through the bandits to the coastal cities.\n\nThe bandit groups break their deal with Governor Swale, jacking prices on grain up precipitously and stopping shipments entirely to encourage Swale and the citizens of his coastal cities to accept the new deal. Governor Swale goes to Fort Beersheba to demand that Falkenberg's regiment go to the Allan Valley farm country to force the Mission Hills Protective Association, the bandit gang terrorizing the farmers, to honor their previous agreement. Falkenberg asks Swale how, exactly, he's to restore the grain supply from farmers who are already oppressed by bandits and unlikely to respond to pressure from both the planetary government and their local bandit gang. When the governor cannot provide a logical answer and refuses Falkenberg's counter-offer to take the farm country back from the bandits, Falkenberg refuses the order to march, as do the Marine garrison commander and Falkenberg's junior officers.\n\nVowing to have them all broken out of the service, Governor Swale orders the Harmony militia (a poorly trained and equipped volunteer part-time military force) to march on the farm country, and accompanies them. However, the governor′s campaign goes poorly and his forces are besieged in the town of Allansport, forcing him to call on Falkenberg and the 501st for help. Sensing things are not as they seem, Falkenberg sends Slater and A Company on a deception mission to bait the enemy south of Allansport, where they find themselves facing the major enemy force waiting in ambush for the main body of the 501st. Though A Company takes heavy casualties, its survivors are able to spot for Falkenberg′s artillery; and Slater takes and holds a strategic hill called the Rockpile. His success cuts the enemy line of retreat and insures their defeat. Slater is severely wounded and medevacked to the capital for regeneration therapy, his second trip to the medics since arriving on Arrarat.\n\nThe political fallout of the Allan Valley Campaign is morally equivocal. Led by a pair of religious fanatics, the farmers avenge themselves on anyone who collaborated with the bandits. Meanwhile, the colonial governor, who was trying to use the bandits to generate revenue to be used to set up industries on Arrarat to provide employment for the time-expired convicts, reveals himself to be in the Bronson camp – and to have arranged the sale of mineral rights from land controlled by the bandits to mining companies affiliated with Grand Senator Bronson.\n\nThe story ends with now-Major Falkenberg explaining the facts described above to Slater, admitting that industrialization should occur in Arrarat to preserve civilization there; but not on Swale's terms, and not merely to enrich the clients of Earth politicians like Bronson. Falkenberg then recruits the newly brevet-promoted and decorated Captain Hal Slater (who, not even a year out of the Academy, is now the youngest captain in the history of the Line Marines) into joining him in Falkenberg′s next assignment as Regimental Adjutant of the 42nd Line Marine Regiment. Slater′s Arrarat-born girlfriend Kathryn agrees to marry and go with him.\n\n\"Originally part of the novel \"The Mercenary\", later incorporated into \"Falkenberg's Legion\"\n\nGrand Admiral Sergei Lermontov, the admiral commanding the CoDominium Navy, has been examining the political situation on Earth and has reached the grim conclusion that Earth is going to destroy itself and slag down into barbarism within a generation. He realizes that if civilization and humanity are to survive, that survival will have to be off Earth, somewhere among Terra's colony worlds.\n\nJohn Christian Falkenberg is recruited by Admiral Lermontov and charged with creating a military force that can create or support a government on one or more of the colonized planets capable of providing the Fleet with a home port when the CoDominium collapses. He is courtmartialed and discharged from the CoDominium Marines on a technicality in order to operate as a mercenary (though because of Grand Senator Bronson's vendetta against him, he was likely to have been arrested anyway).\n\nOn Hadley he encounters a situation he has seen on other colonies, with the added factor that the CD is pulling out and granting the colony \"independence.\" (The CoDominium, becoming shorter and shorter of money to run the Fleet, has been quietly cutting the outlying colony worlds loose to sink or swim on their own. Few are sufficiently well developed to survive at the CoDominium's level of technology; most will revert to barbarism in two generations or less.) The local authorities are trying to create power bases by creating military-style units, some from landowners, some from industrialists, some from the convicts and involuntary colonists. Falkenberg, nominally working for Hadley's government to create its own army, begins recruiting and training his Mercenary Legion, with a battalion of officers and noncoms from his last command, the disestablished 42nd Line Marine Regiment, as the cadre. Eventually this force of three battalions, plus a battalion of local troops nominally part of the Legion but officered by local political hacks and trained separately (and loyal to Ernest Bradford, First Vice President of Hadley), allows him to dictate the outcome.\nThe First Vice President attempts to stage a coup and threatens to kill Hadley's President Budreau, but is instead shot by Legionnaires; Falkenberg anticipated Bradford's actions. The reason for the coup is to promote a takeover by \"democratic\" socialist forces organizing the underclasses. Since most available resources, particularly fusion power urgently needed to build a transport net to move food and people where they are needed are already being used to feed the underclass, any takeover by the populists who have no understanding of how their society works would lead to planetary collapse. Falkenberg carries out a military assault on the socialists in a stadium, killing thousands and eliminating their leaders. The scene of the soldiers descending from the topmost level of the stadium, firing in volleys, is very like the classic \"Odessa Steps\" sequence in the movie \"The Battleship Potemkin\" (except that the readers' sympathies are completely reversed). The ruthlessness of the assault is similar to Napoleon's tactics used when dealing with uprisings in Paris. The sequence is also reminiscent of Belisarius' slaughter of the Nika rioters in the Hippodrome in 6th century Constantinople.\n\nWith the local socialist movement decapitated, Hadley is left in the hands of Second Vice President, now Planetary President, George Hamner. He is an engineer who understands the need to remove the population from the cities to the countryside, build a reliable transportation network, set the involuntary colonists to working the land, and stabilize the agricultural economy if Hadley is to survive at anything above the medieval level. Falkenberg, angered by the necessity of his actions and fully aware that he has perpetrated an atrocity - though convinced it was necessary and unavoidable - takes the Legion and departs. Later, \"Crofton's Encyclopedia of Contemporary History and Social Issues\" refer to the reports of excessive violence on both sides (an understatement, given the outbreak of widespread murder, arson and looting that was only ended by the stadium massacre), saying that \"... the government of Hadley has expressed satisfaction with Falkenberg's efforts there.\"\n\n\"Originally a short story \"His Truth Goes Marching On\", later incorporated into \"Prince of Mercenaries\"\n\nCaptain Peter Owensford of Falkenberg's Mercenary Legion recounts how, as a lieutenant in a volunteer brigade sponsored by the Earth Humanity League, he was part of an intervention on the side of Republican forces against the local rulers, a Spanish aristocracy known as Carlists. Because of the dumping of involuntary colonists from Earth, the Santiago colony on Thurstone has progressed to \"de facto\" slavery by debt bondage to maintain the social order.\n\nThe campaign is brutal, especially with an officer corps of political appointees unable to make proper military decisions. A political officer in the Soviet zampolit style, parroting liberty and atheism instead of communism overrules Owensford's tactical decisions and impedes the training of his men. In the end, after losing many troops, Owensford catches the \"zampolit\" and some cronies preparing to use an atomic bomb to destroy his command and provoke the CoDominium Navy to act against the Carlists. He confiscates the bomb and attempts to retreat, but is caught in a Carlist advance. Owensford surrenders his small company to Falkenberg's Mercenary Legion (who as professionals detached from local politics are less likely to execute him out of hand than the Carlists would be), and becomes a mercenary himself. His commanding officer in the Volunteer Brigade, Captain Anselm \"Ace\" Barton, a fellow West Pointer, has already done so.\n\nParallels with the Spanish Civil War are many and, according to Pournelle, intentional.\n\n\"Originally the novel \"Prince of Mercenaries\". Parts of the novel incorporate the short story \"Silent Leges\"\".\n\nOn the hot jungle planet of Tanith, Falkenberg is working with Governor Carlton Blaine, another Lermontov ally. Tanith is the source of a drug used in the Welfare Islands, \"borloi\", and the revenue from the traffic is being used to support the Fleet as the Senate on Earth cuts its support year by year. Most of the workers on the plantations are convicts. Falkenberg is tasked with ending a rebellion in plantation country. Many of the planters are holding out their \"borloi\", wanting a better price than the CoDominium Navy will pay. Admiral Lermontov and Grand Senator John Grant, his ally in the Grand Senate, are not happy that the Navy is dealing in drugs grown by peons (and perforce must support the slavemasters), but the money thus raised is helping to keep the Fleet operating. Grand Senator Bronson is behind the rebellion, though his involvement is not obvious to anyone save Falkenberg and his command staff.\n\nCrown Prince Lysander of Sparta, heir to the throne of a planet founded with certain political ideals by the Constitutional Society, comes to Tanith to learn about Falkenberg. Sparta is in need of a full-time military force, and they are considering putting Falkenberg and the Legion on retainer to establish their army.\n\nLysander finds himself in the middle of a plot by Grand Senator Bronson to hijack a \"borloi\" shipment. Enlisting with Falkenberg as a cornet (a very junior officer, really an officer-trainee), Lysander learns the realities of military life. The principal military opposition is a battalion of mercenaries, Barton's Bulldogs, commanded by Major Ace Barton (a former Legion officer), who are working for the planters. Lysander plays a major role in the Legion's foiling the theft of the drugs. Barton and Falkenberg broker a truce between the Tanith government and the planters, with the Bulldogs rescuing Falkenberg when one of the planters reneges on the agreement and takes Falkenberg hostage.\n\nBarton's part in the rebellion and his turning against Bronson means he has to leave the planet. With few options, he rejoins Falkenberg, who absorbs the defeated Bulldogs into Falkenberg's Mercenary Legion. Lysander commits Sparta to Lermontov's plan to use Sparta as a base for the CoDominium Navy and Marines after the coming collapse of the CoDominium.\n\nAfter the ending of the planters' rebellion and the expiration of the Legion's contract with the Tanith government, Falkenberg is approached by a rebel group from the planet New Washington to become the main striking force in a revolution against the government of the Franklin Confederacy, another planet in the same system that treats them as a backward colony. At the same time the newly activated Fifth Battalion of the Legion, commanded by the just-promoted Major Peter Owensford with Captain Ace Barton as his second-in-command, is dispatched on contract to the Dual Monarchy of Sparta to set up the Royal Army there.\n\n\"Originally a short novel, \"Sword and Scepter\". Part of the novel \"The Mercenary\", later incorporated into \"Falkenberg's Legion\n\nFalkenberg's Mercenary Legion departs Tanith for a contract on the planet New Washington. This is one of a pair of planets, orbiting a common center which itself orbits a red dwarf star. The two planets are tidally locked, so they always present the same face to each other. As day progresses to night on New Washington, the side of the sister planet Franklin facing it goes from night to day. One revolution takes 40 hours. The pair revolve around their star in 52 days. It is one of the farthest colonies from Earth, being over a hundred parsecs away.\n\nNew Washington was founded by dissidents from the colony on Franklin. They eventually rebel against the officials from Franklin who govern New Washington. Franklin responded by sending both its own troops and later, mercenaries from Earth, Friedland (a German-settled planet whose mercenary forces specialize in mobile armored warfare), and Covenant (a Scots-settled planet with a well deserved reputation for producing fierce infantrymen). This first rebellion succeeds brilliantly against Franklin's domestic army, but is crushed in a set piece battle on the open plain on the Franklin-occupied side of the mountains which divide New Washington's only continent when it faces mercenaries hired by the Franklin Confederacy. The Friedlander tanks and Covenant infantry destroy New Washington's citizen army, and Franklin's forces retaliate against the rebel populace, burning ranches and towns to discourage further rebellion. Franklin leaves the Friedland armor and the Covenanters to maintain order.\n\nFalkenberg is hired to throw out the invaders. The rebel leaders on New Washington are not entirely behind his military objectives, but see his mercenary unit as a nucleus around which a new rebellion can form. After a stealthy spaceborne insertion, Falkenberg and his forces execute a blitzkrieg attack on the isolated loyalist town of Allansport to give him an operating base, from which his troops take the allegedly impregnable fortress of Astoria, capturing a number of Friedland self-propelled guns in the process.\n\nAfter Astoria is taken, Falkenberg's units mount a \"shock and awe\" invasion through large areas of territory, leading the organized forces of the rebel government in another blitzkrieg. The Legion and their allies overwhelm the occupying troops on the west side of the mountain range, \"keepin' up the skeer\" and sending them running frantically while bypassing and besieging the few large concentrations of Franklin troops and their off-planet mercenaries. In an eighty-hour campaign, Falkenberg and the rebel forces occupy almost all of New Washington west of the Temblors, the continent's major mountain range.\n\nThe campaign comes to a decisive battle when a group of Falkenberg's forces, mainly self-propelled artillery captured from the Friedland garrison at Astoria and Franklin units in the path of the blitzkrieg, and a force of New Washington rebel militia guarding the guns and also operating as a vanguard, fight a battle within Hillyer Gap, the only usable pass through the Temblor Mountains between rebel-held country and Franklin territory. Falkenberg's pick-up task force stops the advance of a brigade of Friedland armor and a regiment of Covenant Highlanders at the pass, inflicting devastating casualties on them with his captured artillery. That phase of the second New Washington rebellion is won when a Covenant Highlander officer comes forward under a white flag seeking a truce that would permit the Covenanters to recover their dead and wounded, and for the Legion to transfer the Highlander wounded back to their own medics. Falkenberg grants a truce of four New Washington days and nights—160 standard hours. \"They tried to force the passage, and we beat them fairly. Honor is satisfied. Now the Confederacy will have to bring up its own Regulars if they want to force a way through the Gap. I don't think they'll squander men like that, and anyway it takes time.\" The rebellion becomes a stalemate, with Confederate forces unable to force Hillyer Gap or outflank the forces Falkenberg commands through the swamps south of the Temblors.\n\nFalkenberg then becomes embroiled in rebel politics, at the same time easing into a relationship with Glenda Ruth Horton, commander of the rebel infantry forces and leader of one of the major rebel factions. The rebel force sent to relieve the small garrison Falkenberg left behind in Allansport to secure the town loots and burns it after their commander tells them they can claim part of any government property they find as a reward, this occurring just after Falkenberg and Glenda Ruth won the engagement at Hillyer Gap. The sack of Allansport is a direct violation of the Laws of War, a vestige of CoDominium control over its former colonies that is sporadically enforced by the CoDominium Navy and Marines.\n\nFalkenberg leaves the Legion guarding the pass, bringing a detachment with him to investigate the situation at Allansport. He convinces Glenda Ruth to relieve the ambitious politician Jack Silana who had taken over at Allansport, then returns to the rebel capital with Glenda Ruth and the mayor of Allansport, an influential Loyalist politician. Silana is outraged at his removal and has influence with the leadership. Other rebel leaders are outraged at Falkenberg's four-day-long truce with the Highlanders, demanding that Falkenberg try to force the pass himself. Falkenberg and Glenda Ruth realize this would place their forces at the mercy of the Friedland and Covenant troops that defeated the rebels the first time. Glenda Ruth uses every trick of politics and parliamentary procedure she knows to stall a vote on forcing the Legion to attack. At this point a CoDominium cruiser appears, ostensibly to investigate reports of an alleged breach of the Laws of War.\n\nHer captain is a Lermontov man, working as part of the Grand Admiral's plan for the survival of civilization. The Grand Admiral is concerned with the Franklin - New Washington situation because of the potential the system has to adversely impact his plan. In possession of New Washington, Franklin would be able to build its own Navy and threaten civilization in that sector. The Franklin Confederacy would have New Washington's mines and industrial plants, which are necessary to build ships for a naval fleet that could attack other star systems. Lermontov's goal was to pacify the planet at minimum cost by creating a pretext for the CoDominium to order the mercenaries on both sides to leave. The Franklin Confederacy alone does not possess enough strength to bring New Washington back under Franklin's control, thus ending that particular threat to the peace in CoDominium space.\n\nThis was the reason \"Christ Johnny\" did not try to force the Hillyer Gap. Falkenberg had been expecting the arrival of that CoDominium ship for some time.\n\nHowever, Colonel Falkenberg has decided to stay on New Washington. He negotiated a contract to enforce the Laws of War and protect Allansport from rebel violence with the Mayor of Allansport in return for 50% ownership of the mines and mills there; and secured a land grant from him, and also from the New Washington government for the Legion, thus turning them into settlers instead of mercenaries under CoDominium law. He plans to marry Glenda Ruth Horton. In the end, Falkenberg drives the Confederates off the planet and becomes Protector of New Washington. In fact he is King of New Washington, observing that \"Maybe people are ready for monarchy again, at that.\" (As Pournelle readers know, humanity in this future is indeed heading towards many Monarchial centuries). New Washington is now firmly in the Lermontov camp, and can serve as a base for the Fleet.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions on Earth have grown to the point that when there is a vote of no confidence in the Grand Senate, the Senate dissolves and there is not enough stability in many districts to appoint or elect new Grand Senators. Earth is lurching towards the Great Patriotic Wars which will leave the planet a devastated, desolate ruin.\n\n'Originally the novels \"Go Tell The Spartans\" and \"Prince of Sparta\", co-written with S.M. Stirling\")\n\nThe remaining narrative takes place on the planet Sparta. This terraformed world has a higher gravity that Earth, a higher partial pressure of oxygen, and was settled by academics pursuing a form of government inspired partly by the United States Constitution and partly by the culture of the Kingdom of Sparta in the Classical Era of Greece. The planet has been settled for approximately three generations. Like all of the colony worlds, the population is partly volunteer emigrants and partly involuntary colonists and convicts dispatched there by BuReLock (the Codominium's Bureau of Relocation). The latter form an underclass.\n\nSparta is a constitutional dual monarchy, one King taking external affairs, the other King being involved in the domestic economy. Citizenship with the right to vote is an earned privilege, as in the Terran Federation of Heinlein's Starship Troopers. Citizens are also expected to join the militia, built on the model of the Swiss militia system. The militia battalions are based on membership in the phratries of Sparta, to which all Citizens and Citizen-candidates must belong. Other than enforcing basic law and providing education and public services, the government does not interfere in the lives of the people. Prosperity or starvation is the responsibility of the individual.\n\nThe underclass can attempt to become Citizens; many do, and on achieving Citizenship enjoy the same rights and privileges as those born on Sparta. For the rest, the usual populists and progressives try to organize them into a Movement. Paradoxically, Sparta's openness and political transparency makes it more vulnerable to such a movement than dictatorships such as Carlist Santiago. One such movement, the Non-Citizens Liberation Front, has a guerrilla army of self-styled Helots.\n\nAfter the episode on Tanith, Grand Senator Bronson begins building up the open and covert oppositions on Sparta. His motives are actually similar to Admiral Lermontov's; he too wishes to set up a power base among the colonies to preserve his version of civilization when the CoDominium collapses. However, his goal is to become \"Chairman of as much as possible\" (read: dictator) and establish a dynasty, continuing the Welfare system of Earth with himself as the head of an empire of some kind. His lust for power precludes his finding common ground with Lermontov, Blaine and Falkenberg. Bronson rejects the Admiral's attempt to broker a truce between him and Falkenberg's Mercenary Legion, and by extension planets like Sparta and other Lermontov allies.\n\nInstead, he sends supplies and advisors to organize the Helot forces and employs \"techno-ninja\" saboteurs from Meiji, a Japanese-settled planet that specializes in high technology, to infiltrate and corrupt the data systems on Sparta before an open revolt is launched, and at the direction of the Helot leadership, to conduct a program of judicious assassinations. Bronson's objective is to take over and control Sparta and its resources. His title in connection with the Spartan revolutionary movement is Earth Prime.\n\nThe Non-Citizens Liberation Front is led by Senator Dion Croser, a highly intelligent second-generation Spartan who is the son of one of the Founders, the professors, idealists, and members of the Constitutional Society who formed the first wave of settlers, wrote the Spartan constitution, and established their form of government. Croser feels that his father was done out of his rightful position as the head of government (one of the two Spartan kings, in other words) and by way of righting that wrong wants to overthrow the government and create a \"democracy\" similar to the oligarchy the United States of America has devolved into, with himself as its President. He gets together with Skida Thibodeau, an amoral convict whose life experience indicates you are either on top holding the whip, or on the bottom being whipped; and who has no intention of ever being on the bottom again, to advance his goal. The NCLF organizes public protests, holds rallies, makes public broadcasts, encourages civil disobedience by non-Citizens, and generally makes itself a bloody nuisance to the Spartan government. The NCLF also quietly recruits malcontents among the convicts and involuntary transportees, and idealists from among those born on Sparta, for the Spartan Peoples Liberation Army. It further engages in an ongoing sabotage campaign. Croser's title within the revolutionary movement is Capital Prime.\n\nThe Spartan Peoples Liberation Army is led by a woman, Skida \"Skilly\" Thibodeau, a native of Belize transported off Earth after arrest for criminal activity. Thibodeau is highly intelligent and an amateur student of military history; a profile developed by Legion Intelligence suggests that she may be a sociopath. Skida devises complex operations against the Dual Monarchy, which the Legion is able to detect and defeat despite the Helots' advanced weaponry and sabotage campaigns. The Helots have off-planet assistance from Earth Prime in the form of military equipment and supplies up to and including surface-to-air missiles and direct induction teaching machines, former CoDominium Marine officers and noncoms, and the technoninjas from Meiji, who work for Bronson but have been instructed to accept Helot orders up to a point. Thibodeau's title within the revolutionary movement is Field Prime.\n\nThere is no visible linkage between the Spartan Peoples Liberation Army and the NCLF, though the connection exists. Likewise, there is no provable connection between Grand Senator Bronson and the Helot rebels, though Falkenberg's Mercenary Legion knows he is supporting them.\n\nTo end the Helot rebellion, the Fifth Battalion of Falkenberg's Mercenary Legion is sent to Sparta to create a standing army, something Sparta has never before needed. Commanding the Fifth is Major Peter Owensford, with Captain Ace Barton (the mercenary commander Falkenberg defeated on Tanith) as his second in command. They are joined by Dr. Caldwell Whitlock, a sociologist, analyst, and political historian from Earth who has been retained by the Spartan monarchy and Falkenberg as a political analyst and advisor; and Lieutenant Colonel Hal Slater, recently retired from the Legion due to injuries too severe for regeneration to fully repair, whose mission is to establish the Royal Spartan Military Academy and Royal Spartan War College, with the rank of Major General in the nascent Royal Spartan Army. (It has been suggested that with his American Southern roots, Whitlock may be a stand-in for the author, Jerry Pournelle, who is from Louisiana.)\n\nMuch of the narrative is taken up with three bloody campaigns in which Skilly's Helot rebels employ artillery, missiles, rape, murder, poison gas, terror attacks, and civilian massacre in an attempt to undermine Spartan society. The net effect, however, is to unify the Citizens and the Crown, the opposite of what the SPLA and the NCLF desire. Along the way, the Fifth Battalion of the Legion is accepted by the Spartan culture, which comes to view them as Spartans, not mercenaries. Following the passage of the Ultimate Decree (an extreme form of martial law) by the Spartan Senate, the NCLF is taken down by the Spartan government's law enforcement agencies. Those among its leadership and members found guilty of terrorist acts are hanged as traitors after interrogation. The Helot field army is eventually destroyed by the Spartan Royal Army, the Brotherhood militias, and the Legion, working in concert under the leadership of Crown Prince Lysander, Brigadier General Ace Barton, and Major General Peter Owensford.\n\nThe penultimate act of the Bronson campaign is an attempt to use the 77th Line Marine Regiment, whose colonel is loyal to Bronson, to force the Dual Monarchy to disavow, disarm, and turn over the Fifth Battalion of the Legion to them. King Alexander and King David of Sparta refuse this demand. The 77th has the support of the suborned Codominium Navy battle cruiser \"Patton\", whose captain is an opportunist loyal to neither the Grand Admiral's nor Bronson factions. The presumption is that without the Legion, Sparta will not be able to resist the CoDominium forces. At the same time, Skilly launches a general uprising by Helot elements in the capital to destroy the government and take Sparta City while the Spartans are fighting the 77th. Skilly believes if she can take the city, the CoDominium forces will recognize her as the legitimate ruler of Sparta.\n\nThe planet's orbiting space station/weapons platform is taken over by elements of the 77th, then retaken by the Legion and CoDominium Navy units loyal to Lermontov. A fratricidal space battle between the battle cruiser whose captain is aware of what he can do with the force at his command on one side, and the recaptured space station plus the CoDominium naval squadron based on Sparta whose captains and officers support Lermontov on the other, is averted. The scenario graphically demonstrates the chaos to come after the CoDominium falls.\n\nOrdinary armed Spartan Citizens stand and fight with so much determination that the Line Marines, contrasting the Citizens with the Helots, change sides. Working together, the 77th, the unorganized Spartan reserve, and the few Brotherhood militia units in the city suppress the Helot rioters and restore order. However, Lysander's father King Alexander, a longtime Lermontov ally, is killed when the palace is assaulted and he leads the Life Guard out to defend it. Crown Prince Lysander succeeds him.\n\nOne of Skilly's officers, a nephew of Grand Senator Bronson who had been a field grade officer in the Helot Army and Skilly Thibodeau's lover, defects and informs Lysander and General Owensford that there is an atomic bomb somewhere in the capital. Skilly, on the run following the destruction of the Spartan Peoples Liberation Army and the failure of the Helot rebellion in Sparta City, contacts the Spartan commanders, offering the location of the bomb in return for the government's lifting the price on her head and calling off the official search for her. King Lysander and General Owensford agree to do so, but unbeknownst to her it will make no difference. Two long-serving sergeants of the Legion with a highly developed sense of vendetta simply take leaves to accomplish privately what the government cannot do officially. It is implied that Skilly's head will shortly be brought in encased in a block of lucite.\n\nThe problem of the captured or surrendered underclass Helot soldiers is dealt with in a fashion that again echoes Heinlein's ideas, this the one of being sent to Coventry. Those who do not accept Sparta's social contract will be given basic tools and sent to a large, uninhabited island to make their own way without government interference. It is suggested that after a few years, the survivors can try to work out a better deal.\n\nThere remains the problem of preserving civilization, however. The CoDominium has fallen, but if civilization is to be preserved there must be some power beyond that of planetary or systemwide governments that can keep the peace and insure that justice is done. Admiral Lermontov's work had been entirely to this goal. However, Lermontov has been deposed by a rump Grand Senate composed of Adrian Bronson, his allies, and his vassals. It is not known if the Grand Admiral is dead or imprisoned, but the leadership on Sparta presumes he is dead.\n\nIn his final orders to the Fleet, the Grand Admiral names a group of people the Fleet can obey with honor until they themselves appoint a single leader to direct them: Grand Senator John Grant; Carlton Blaine, Governor of Tanith; Colonel John Christian Falkenberg; and King Alexander of Sparta.\n\nHowever, they are separated by light-years of space and months of transit time.

{"id": "2129782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2129782", "title": "Degree distribution", "text": "Degree distribution\n\nIn the study of graphs and networks, the degree of a node in a network is the number of connections it has to other nodes and the degree distribution is the probability distribution of these degrees over the whole network.\n\nThe degree of a node in a network (sometimes referred to incorrectly as the connectivity) is the number of connections or edges the node has to other nodes. If a network is directed, meaning that edges point in one direction from one node to another node, then nodes have two different degrees, the in-degree, which is the number of incoming edges, and the out-degree, which is the number of outgoing edges.\n\nThe degree distribution \"P\"(\"k\") of a network is then defined to be the fraction of nodes in the network with degree \"k\". Thus if there are \"n\" nodes in total in a network and \"n\" of them have degree \"k\", we have \"P\"(\"k\") = \"n\"/\"n\".\n\nThe same information is also sometimes presented in the form of a \"cumulative degree distribution\", the fraction of nodes with degree smaller than \"k\", or even the \"complementary cumulative degree distribution\", the fraction of nodes with degree greater than or equal to \"k\" (1 - \"C\") if one considers \"C\" as the \"cumulative degree distribution\"; i.e. the complement of \"C\".\n\nThe degree distribution is very important in studying both real networks, such as the Internet and social networks, and theoretical networks. The simplest network model, for example, the (Erdős–Rényi model) random graph, in which each of \"n\" nodes is independently connected (or not) with probability \"p\" (or 1 − \"p\"), has a binomial distribution of degrees \"k\":\n\n(or Poisson in the limit of large \"n\", if the average degree formula_2 is held fixed). Most networks in the real world, however, have degree distributions very different from this. Most are highly right-skewed, meaning that a large majority of nodes have low degree but a small number, known as \"hubs\", have high degree. Some networks, notably the Internet, the world wide web, and some social networks were argued to have degree distributions that approximately follow a power law: formula_3, where \"γ\" is a constant. Such networks are called scale-free networks and have attracted particular attention for their structural and dynamical properties. However, recently, there have been some researches based on real-world data sets claiming despite the fact that most of the observed networks have fat-tailed degree distributions, they deviate from being scale-free. \n\nExcess degree distribution is the probability distribution, for a node reached by following an edge, of the number of other edges attached to that node. In other words, it is the distribution of outgoing links from a node reached by following a link.\n\nSuppose a network has a degree distribution formula_4, by selecting one node (randomly or not) and going to one of its neighbors (assuming to have one neighbor at least), then the probability of that node to have formula_5 neighbors is not given by formula_4. The reason is that, whenever some node is selected in a heterogeneous network, it is more probable to reach the hobs by following one of the existing neighbors of that node. The true probability of such nodes to have degree formula_5 is formula_8 which is called the \"excess degree\" of that node. In the configuration model, which correlations between the nodes have been ignored and every node is assumed to be connected to any other nodes in the network with the same probability, the excess degree distribution can be found as:\n\nformula_9\n\nwhere formula_10 is the mean-degree (average degree) of the model. It follows to that fact that the average degree of the neighbor of any node is greater than the average degree of that node. In social networks, it mean that your friends, on average, have more friends than you. This is famous as the friendship paradox. It can be shown that a network can have a giant component, if its average excess degree is larger than one:\n\nformula_11\n\nBear in mind that the last two equations are just for the configuration model and to derive the excess degree distribution of a real-word network, we should also add degree correlations into account.\n\nGenerating functions can be used to calculate different properties of random networks. Given the degree distribution and the excess degree distribution of some network, formula_4 and formula_8 respectively, it is possible to write two power series in the following forms:\n\nformula_14 and formula_15\n\nformula_16 can also be obtained from derivatives of formula_17:\n\nformula_18\n\nIf we know the generating function for a probability distribution formula_4 then we can recover the values of formula_4 by differentiating:\n\nformula_21\n\nSome properties, e.g. the moments, can be easily calculated from formula_22 and its derivatives:\n\n\nAnd in general:\n\n\nFor Poisson-distributed random networks, such as the ER graph, formula_26, that is the reason why the theory of random networks of this type is especially simple. The probability distributions for the 1st and 2nd-nearest neighbors are generated by the functions formula_22 and formula_28. By extension, the distribution of formula_29-th neighbors is generated by:\n\nformula_30, with formula_31 iterations of the function formula_32 acting on itself.\n\nThe average number of 1st neighbors, formula_33, is formula_34 and the average number of 2nd neighbors is: formula_35\n\nIn a directed network, each node has some in-degree formula_36 and some out-degree formula_37 which are the number of links which have run into and out of that node respectfully. If formula_38 is the probability that a randomly chosen node has in-degree formula_36 and out-degree formula_37 then the generating function assigned to this joint probability distribution can be written with two valuables formula_41 and formula_42 as:\n\nformula_43 \n\nSince every link in a directed network must leave some node and enter another, the net average number of links entering\n\na node is zero. Therefore, \n\nformula_44,\n\nwhich implies that, the generation function must satisfy:\n\nformula_45\n\nwhere formula_46 is the mean degree (both in and out) of the nodes in the network; formula_47\n\nUsing the function formula_48, we can again find the generation function for the in/out-degree distribution and in/out-excess degree distribution, as before. formula_49 can be defined as generating functions for the number of arriving links at a randomly chosen node, and formula_50can be defined as the number of arriving links at a node reached by following a randomly chosen link. We can also define generating functions formula_51 and formula_52 for the number leaving such a node:\n\n\nHere, the average number of 1st neighbors, formula_57, or as previously introduced as formula_33, is formula_59 and the average number of 2nd neighbors reachable from a randomly chosen node is given by: formula_60. These are also the numbers of 1st and 2nd neighbors from which a random node can be reached, since these equations are manifestly symmetric in formula_41 and formula_62.\n\n\n"}

The Center is a historical monument in Muskegon County, and is considered one of the best theaters in Michigan, outside of Detroit.\n\nConcerts, movies, and other events are held throughout the calendar year, such as the Miss Michigan pageant, West Michigan Symphony Orchestra, the Muskegon Film Festival, America's Tallest Singing Christmas Tree, and the Muskegon Civic Theater's productions. The Center is often home to traveling shows, or musical groups as well. The Frauenthal Theater has also become a popular venue for weddings and wedding receptions, due to the theater's large seating capacity and beauty.\n\nThe Frauenthal was built in 1929 as the Michigan Theater as a \"100% all talking motion pictures\" for $690,000. The theater seats 1726 people. The theater was closed from the early 1970s to 1976. It was purchased by a community foundation and renamed in honor of A. Harold Frauenthal, who provided a gift of funds to purchase the theater, an abandoned furniture store, and storage space, which were all adjacent to the Frauenthal. The Community Foundation for Muskegon County operated the Center through the 70's and 80's, however the theater lacked the dressing rooms and support spaces to properly run a show, so they transformed the abandoned furniture store into what is now known as the Hilt Building which houses the 170 seat Beardsley Theater, art gallery, dressing rooms, reception areas, meeting rooms, and rehearsal spaces.\n\nRenovation on the theater was due once again in 1992, so the Community Foundation funded the creation of a $16 million master plan for renovations. After the bonds were passed, and everything was finalized, work began in 1998. The theater had been brought back to its original glory, along with safety and accessibility improvements. The lighting, sound, and rigging system's were all brought up to the highest current technology, as well as expanded to fit the needs of the theater. Additionally, a new lobby adjacent to the theater was added, featuring two levels, and connecting the foyer of the original lobby with the lobby of the Hilt Building.

{"id": "2129799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2129799", "title": "Inverse condemnation", "text": "Inverse condemnation\n\nInverse condemnation is a term used in the law to describe a situation in which the government takes private property but fails to pay the compensation required by the 5th Amendment of the Constitution, so the property's owner has to sue to obtain the required just compensation. In some states the term also includes damaging of property as well as its taking. In inverse condemnation cases the owner is the plaintiff and that is why the action is called inverse the order of parties is reversed, as compared to the usual procedure in direct condemnation where the government is the plaintiff who sues a defendant-owner to take his or her property.\n\nThe taking can be physical (e.g., land seizure, flooding, retention of possession after a lease to the government expires, deprivation of access, removal of ground support) or it can be a regulatory taking (when regulations are so onerous that they make the regulated property unusable by its owner for any reasonable or economically viable purpose). The latter is the most controversial form of inverse condemnation. It can occur when the regulation of the property's use is so severe that it goes \"too far,\" as Justice Holmes put it in \"Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon\", 260 U.S. 393 (1922), and deprives the owner of the property's value, utility or marketability, denying him or her the benefits of property ownership thus accomplishing a constitutionally forbidden de facto taking without compensation.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has not elaborated on what \"too far\" is, and the doctrinal basis for its jurisprudence has been widely criticized as confused and inconsistent. But the court has articulated three situations in which inverse condemnation occurs. These are (a) physical seizure or occupation, (b) the reduction of the regulated property's utility or value to such an extent that it is no longer capable of economically viable use, and (c) where as a precondition to the issuance of a building permit, the government demands that the regulated owner convey property to the government even though there is no rational nexus between the owner's activity's impact on public resources and the owner's proposed regulated use, or where the extent of the exaction is not proportional to the effect of the owner's activities (\"Nollan v. California Coastal Commission\" and \"Dolan v. City of Tigard\").\n\nApart from these three situations known as per se regulatory takings, the decision whether or not a taking has occurred is made by judicial consideration of three factors: (a) the nature of the government regulation, (b) the economic impact of the regulation on the subject property, and (c) the extent to which the regulation interferes with the owner's reasonable, investment-backed expectations. This is known as the three-factor Penn Central test (after \"Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City\" where it was articulated). The Penn Central decision has been severely criticized by commentators on both sides of the \"taking issue\" controversy, because its \"three-factor\" approach is so vague that it enables judges to reach whatever result they prefer. It also makes it extremely difficult for lawyers to tell in advance of filing a lawsuit what facts will be deemed decisive by the court, and how to apply them. The problem is that the U.S. Supreme court has failed to articulate the elements of a cause of action in regulatory taking cases, offering its supposed inability to do so as the reason, and has offered only those \"factors,\" without indicating what importance to ascribe to each, and how to determine whether they have been established.\n\nRailroads and other public utilities which are granted the power of condemnation (or eminent domain) by state statute, can be liable for inverse taking or where appropriate, when they take or damage private property when they act in the performance of their regulated activities.\n\nAn inverse taking need not be a taking of land or rights in land (such as easements). It can be a taking of personal property (e.g. supplies for the army in wartime), intellectual property (patents and copyrights), as well as contracts. \n\nThe trial of a typical inverse condemnation action is bifurcated. First, there is a bench trial to determine liability, and if the judge determines that a taking has occurred, there is a second (typically jury) trial to determine compensation. Some states (i.e., New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island) do not provide jury trials in such cases. The measure of compensation is the same as in direct condemnation actions in which the government concedes that a taking has occurred, and the sole issue is the amount of compensation.\n\nBy statute, many states also provide for recovery of attorneys' and appraisers' fees in successful inverse condemnation actions.\n\nsee also\nKnick v. Township of Scott, Pennsylvania, et al US Supreme Court No.17-647. Decided June 21, 2019\n\n"}

After medical school and a short position as a surgeon in Mulhouse, France, he became an ICRC delegate and was deployed in Ethiopia during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, and in Europe as well as in Japan during World War II. In 1947, he wrote a book with the title \"Warrior without Weapons\" about his experiences. After the war, he worked for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as chief representative in China, and settled back in Europe in 1950. He founded the anaesthesiology department of the Cantonal Hospital in Geneva and became the first professor in this discipline at the University of Geneva. In 1952, he was appointed a member of the ICRC and, after many more missions for this institution, was Vice-President from 1959 until his death in 1961.\n\nMarcel Junod was born in Neuchâtel, Switzerland as the fifth of seven children, to Richard Samuel Junod (1868–1919) and Jeanne Marguerite Bonnet (1866–1952). His father was a pastor for the Independent Protestant Church of Neuchâtel, first working in mining villages in Belgium and later in poor communities near Neuchâtel and La Chaux-de-Fonds in Switzerland; the latter being where Junod spent most of his childhood. After the death of his father, his family returned to his mother's home of Geneva. A legal rule of the time allowed Junod and his two younger sisters to obtain Genevan citizenship. In order to earn a living, his mother and aunt opened a boarding house.\n\nJunod completed his initial education in 1923 with a baccalaureate diploma from Geneva's Collège Calvin, the same school that Red Cross founder Henry Dunant had attended. As a student, he volunteered in charity work and directed the Relief Movement for Russian Children in Geneva. Due to generous financial support from his uncle Henri-Alexandre Junod he was able to follow his aspirations and study medicine in Geneva and Strasbourg, obtaining his MD in 1929. He opted for special training in the field of surgery and interned at hospitals in Geneva and Mulhouse, France (1931–1935). He completed his training in Mulhouse in 1935, and began work as the head of the Mulhouse hospital's surgical clinic.\n\nImmediately after the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, Junod received a call on October 15, 1935, from a friend in Geneva recommending him to take a position as delegate for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Ethiopia. Encouraged by the head doctor of the clinic in Mulhouse, he accepted the offer and soon traveled to Addis Ababa with a second ICRC delegate, Sidney Brown. He would remain in Ethiopia until the end of the Abyssinian War in May 1936.\n\nBecause of his experience in law, Sidney Brown worked on the establishment of an effective national Red Cross Society in Ethiopia. Junod focused on the maintenance and coordination of Red Cross ambulances provided by the Red Cross societies of Egypt, Finland, the UK, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. While the Ethiopian Red Cross, having been founded only shortly before the outbreak of the war, accepted support from the ICRC and the League of Red Cross societies, the Italian Red Cross refused any cooperation, as Italy had not accepted the offer of services of the ICRC.\n\nSome of the most difficult experiences for Junod during the war involved the attacks on Red Cross ambulances by the Italian military and Ethiopian armed groups. A bombing of a Swedish ambulance on December 30, 1935 killed 28 Red Cross workers and patients and wounded 50. He was also witness to a number of horrific episodes in this war characterized by the extreme gap in technological capabilities of the two sides. Among other events, he witnessed the bombardment of the city Dessie by the Italian air force, the use of mustard gas against civilian populations in the towns of Degehabur and Sassabaneh, and the plundering of Addis Ababa in the final days of the war.\n\nIn July 1936 the ICRC sought a delegate for an investigation mission to Spain, where civil war had just broken out. Once again Junod was selected. Contrary to the ICRC's initial plan of a three-week deployment, he ultimately stayed for over three years, and the ICRC expanded the mission, led by Junod, to nine delegates spread across the country.\n\nThe activities of the Red Cross were hindered by the problem that the Geneva Conventions had no legal application to civil conflicts. As a solution, Junod suggested the creation of a new combined commission with representatives of the ICRC and of the warring sides, but the parties could not agree. The commission would have coordinated work on the release of captured women and children, the erection of neutral international zones, and the compilation of prisoner lists.\n\nDespite the ambiguous legal basis for the Red Cross' work in this conflict, Junod succeeded to convince the warring parties to sign and implement a number of agreements regarding prisoner exchange and other issues, thereby saving many lives. Before the fall of Barcelona he achieved the release of five thousand prisoners whose lives were endangered by fighting for the city. He also organized research and information exchange regarding prisoners and missing persons using the Red Cross card system for the first time in the context of civil conflict, and by the end of the war the ICRC had facilitated the exchange of five million cards.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War II, Junod was called to Geneva by a letter from the ICRC and was once again made an ICRC delegate, releasing him from his obligations as a medical officer for the Swiss Army. He started his mission on September 16, 1939 in Berlin and for a long time remained the only ICRC delegate in Germany and its soon-to-be occupied territories. Only eleven days later, on September 27, he visited a camp with Polish prisoners of war. In June 1940 he succeeded in preventing a series of threatened executions of French POWs, which had been planned as retaliation for the falsely assumed execution of German paratroopers. Once again he organized the forwarding and exchange of information relating to POWs, this time with the support of the ICRC central office for POWs in Geneva.\n\nThe central tasks in this war were the observation of the adherence to the Geneva Conventions in POW camps and the distribution of provisions and medical supplies to the civil populations of occupied territories. Yet the civil population effort was not part of the legally defined role of the ICRC and would not be so until the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention. To provide logistical support for these efforts, Junod worked to introduce the first use of Red Cross ships, specially marked with the neutral symbols of the ICRC, to provide needed goods and supplies. For example, a number of ships were provided by Belgium (\"Caritas I\", \"Caritas II\" and \"Henri Dunant\"), Turkey (\"Kurtulus\", \"Dumlupinar\"), and Sweden (\"Hallaren\", \"Sturebog\"). Sadly, on June 9, 1942, despite its neutral markings, the \"Sturebog\" was sunk by an Italian aircraft.\n\nIn December 1944, Junod married his wife Eugénie Georgette Perret (1915-1970). After a short break from being a delegate, during part of which he worked in the ICRC headquarters in Geneva, in June 1945 he was sent to Japan and arrived in Tokyo on August 9. His original mission involved the visit of POWs in Japanese camps and the supervision of the adherence to the Geneva Conventions in Japanese territory. His mission in Japan took place while his wife was expecting a child at home.\n\nAfter the American dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima (August 6, 1945) and Nagasaki (August 9, 1945) and the subsequent Japanese surrender, Junod organized the evacuation of POW camps and the Allied rescue of the often severely injured inmates. On August 30, he received photographic evidence and a telegraph description of the conditions in Hiroshima. He quickly organized an assistance mission and on September 8 became the first foreign doctor to reach the site. He was accompanied by an American investigation task force, two Japanese doctors, and 15 tons of medical supplies. He stayed there for five days, during which he visited all of the major hospitals, administered the distribution of supplies, and personally gave medical care. The photographs from Hiroshima, which he gave to the ICRC, were some of the first pictures of the city after the explosion to reach Europe.\n\nHis deployment in Japan and other surrounding Asian countries lasted until April 1946 when he was able to return to Switzerland, having missed the birth of his son Benoit in October 1945. After he returned, he wrote the book \"Le Troisième Combattant\", entitled in English, \"Warrior Without Weapons\". It describes, in very personal language, his experiences during his various ICRC deployments. Other editions were published in German, in Spanish, Danish, Swedish, Dutch, Japanese and Serbo-Croatian. An Italian translation of the book appeared in 2006, nearly 60 years later. It has been reprinted several times by the International Committee of the Red Cross in English, French and Spanish. The book is sometimes called the \"bedside volume of all young ICRC delegates.\"\n\nFrom January 1948 until April 1949, Junod was active as a representative of the UN children's help organization, UNICEF, in China, after being invited for that position by then UNICEF director Maurice Pate. However, due to an illness that made it difficult to stand for long periods of time, he had to cut off his deployment. He also had to turn down a mission for the World Health Organization (WHO) and was forced to give up his career as a surgeon. He decided to become a specialist in anesthesiology, which would allow him to work sitting down. The need for additional training and education led him to Paris and London, and in 1951 he returned to Geneva and opened a new practice. For the first time since his time at the hospital in Mulhouse, he began regular work once again as a doctor. In 1953, he convinced the management of the Cantonal Hospital of Geneva to open an anesthesiology department, of which he later became the director. He was also able to finally devote himself to medical research, which he presented in numerous journals and at conferences.\n\nIn 1946, the USA wanted to honour Junod with the Medal of Liberty for his work on behalf of Allied prisoners in Japan, but a rule that Swiss citizens, while bound to military service, cannot accept foreign decorations, prevented him from receiving it. Four years later in 1950, he received the Gold Medal for Peace of Prince Carl of Sweden for his extensive humanitarian service. He was appointed a member of the ICRC on October 23, 1952 and elected vice-president in 1959. At the beginning of 1953, he relocated to Lullier, a small, charming village near Geneva, to find respite from his double burden as a physician and member of the ICRC. He spent almost all of his holidays with friends in Barcelona whom he knew from his mission in Spain. His positions in the ICRC sent him to Budapest, Vienna, Cairo, and elsewhere. In 1957 he attended the International Red Cross Conference in New Delhi, and in 1960 he visited national Red Cross societies in the Soviet Union, Taiwan, Thailand, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, Canada, and the United States. In December 1960 he was appointed Professor of Anesthesiology in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Geneva.\n\nMarcel Junod died on June 16, 1961 in Geneva from a massive heart attack while working as an anesthesiologist in an operation. The ICRC received more than 3,000 letters and other messages of condolence from all over the world. In the same year, he was posthumously awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the government of Japan. On September 8, 1979, a monument to Junod was inaugurated in the Hiroshima Peace Park. Each year on the anniversary of his death a commemorative meeting is held in front of the monument. On September 13, 2005, 60 years after he left Hiroshima, a similar monument was inaugurated in Geneva by the town and cantonal authorities.\n\nThe last sentence of the following quotation from the final chapter of Junod's book is written on the back of the Hiroshima monument:\n\n\n"}

She won 25 of her Grand Slam titles at the U.S. Championships, which is an all-time record.\n\nDuPont won six Grand Slam singles titles. She saved match points in the final of the 1946 French International Championships (versus Pauline Betz) and in the final of the 1948 U.S. National Championships (versus Louise Brough). The 48 games played during the 1948 final remain the most ever played in a women's singles final at that tournament.\n\nDuPont teamed with Brough to win 20 Grand Slam women's doubles titles, which ties Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver for the most Grand Slam titles ever won by a women's doubles team. DuPont and Brough won nine consecutive titles at the U.S. National Championships from 1942 through 1950. They won that tournament 12 of the 14 years they entered as a team. Their 12 titles is an all-time record for a women's doubles team at the U.S. National Championships, well-surpassing the four career titles won by the teams of Navratilova and Shriver, Doris Hart and Shirley Fry, and Sarah Palfrey Cooke and Alice Marble. DuPont won 13 women's doubles titles, ten of which were in succession from 1941 through 1950, at the U.S. National Championships. Both of those are all-time records.\n\nDuPont's nine mixed doubles titles at the U.S. National Championships is more than any other player.

A ratings success at the time, it was written by John Chapman and produced by Thames Television for ITV, running for four series between 7 March 1984 and 23 October 1986.\n\nHester and William Fields (McKenzie and Rodgers) are a devoted middle-aged, middle-class couple living an idyllic suburban lifestyle in Barnes, London. William works as an accountant while Hester is a housewife who works part-time in local restaurant Lucy's Kitchen. The title's meaning, and crux of the show, is that Hester combats empty-nest syndrome by livening up her life with new interests and hobbies, to the exasperation of her hard-working husband who just wants a quiet life. The show's opening credits, featuring silhouettes of the characters, reflect this: Hester rides an exercise bike and plays a drumkit while William relaxes in a rocking chair.\n\nThe family home has an attached granny flat in which Hester's mother Nancy (Fanny Rowe) lives following her divorce from Hester's roguish father Guy (Ballard Berkeley); he often tries to win her back. (The pair finally remarry in the last episode.) Hester and William have two children of their own: the never-seen Tom who lives in New Zealand; and Emma, who is usually only heard (voice of Debby Cummings) telephoning her parents at inconvenient times. Emma's husband Peter (Philip Bird) appears occasionally; Emma and Peter later present the Fields with their first grandchild Guy, named after his great-grandfather.\n\nThe Fields's neighbour Sonia Barrett (played by Ann Beach) pops round in every episode to borrow items; these appearances would irritate William to comical effect. Sonia had the show's only catchphrase: \"It's only Sonia!\" she carols as she raps at the Fields's back door then lets herself in. Sonia's husband John (John Arthur) appears occasionally, as does William's secretary Miss Marigold Denham (Daphne Oxenford).\n\n\"Fresh Fields\" ended in 1986 but three years later the series resumed as \"French Fields\", which saw William and Hester relocating to France after William accepted a job there.

Sharp played as a striker for Dumbarton, Everton, Oldham Athletic and Bangor City. He enjoyed great success with Everton, helping them win English league championships in 1985 and 1987, the FA Cup in 1984 and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1985. He made 12 international appearances for Scotland, and was selected in their 1986 World Cup squad.\n\nSharp moved to Oldham Athletic in 1991, and helped the newly-promoted club stay in the top flight for three seasons. He was appointed player/manager of Oldham in November 1994, but he left the club in March 1997 with them on the verge of being relegated to the third tier. Sharp was then player/manager of Welsh club Bangor City for a year. He has since worked in media coverage of football and as a club ambassador for Everton.\n\nSharp started his playing career at Dumbarton before signing for Everton for £120,000 in 1980. He did not walk into the first team at Goodison Park, and by the end of the 1980–81 season had still made just six league appearances for the club. But then came new manager Howard Kendall, who soon selected Sharp as a regular striker and was rewarded handsomely as Sharp netted 15 goals in 29 league games. The goals continued to flow over the next nine seasons.\n\nSharp's greatest achievements were as part of the Everton team which in 1984 won the FA Cup (he scored the first goal in the final), in 1985 and 1987 won the Football League First Division and also in 1985 the European Cup Winners' Cup. In October 1984, he scored the lone goal in Everton's first win at Anfield since 1970. He was on the losing side in the FA Cup finals of 1986 and 1989, with both of these finals being won by Everton's local rivals Liverpool. His key role in this golden era led to his inclusion in Everton's \"Greatest Ever Team\", following a poll in the club's 125th anniversary.\n\nAfter Gary Lineker's departure to FC Barcelona in the 1986 close season, Sharp had a succession of strike partners. First he played alongside Paul Wilkinson, Adrian Heath (also a midfielder) and then Wayne Clarke before the arrival of £2million Tony Cottee for the start of the 1988–89 season. This was the season where Everton were on the losing side in two Wembley finals – first they lost 4–3 to Nottingham Forest in the Full Members Cup final (in which Sharp scored a goal) and then they were beaten 3–2 by Liverpool in the second all Merseyside FA Cup final in four seasons.\n\nDespite the arrival of another striker – Mike Newell – a year later, Sharp remained a regular player with 33 games and six goals in the 1989–90 season in a three-man attack. For a while it looked as though Sharp could be on the verge of another title triumph with Everton as they went top of the league in late autumn 1989, but they failed to sustain their title challenge and finished sixth as Liverpool sealed their 18th (and to date most recent) league title. He remained a regular player in 1990–91, though his 27 league appearances delivered just three goals. With speculation that manager Howard Kendall (who had returned in November 1990 more than three years after leaving Everton) was about to sign Dean Saunders, it appeared the Sharp's days at Goodison Park were numbered. Sharp did not appear to be part Kendall's future plans and he departed to Oldham Athletic (managed by former Everton player Joe Royle) in July 1991, allowing new signing Peter Beardsley, along with Tony Cottee and Mike Newell, to start the 1991–92 season as Everton's strikeforce.\n\nSharp was regarded as good in the air and able to hold the ball well and distribute it to provide more scoring opportunities for others than for himself. He formed successful scoring partnerships with Andy Gray, Adrian Heath and Gary Lineker. In the 1984–85 season Sharp scored 30 goals in 54 matches. In 426 appearances for Everton (21 as substitute), Sharp scored 159 goals to set a post war goalscoring for Everton which has yet to be matched. Only Dixie Dean (pre Second World War) has ever scored more goals for the club than Sharp did. As well as winning two league titles, a European Cup Winners' Cup and an FA Cup with Everton (and collecting three runners-up medals in the FA Cup and another in the League Cup), Sharp's exploits also included a four-goal yield in a 4-0 league win at Southampton in October 1987, his first Everton hat-trick in a 5-2 home win over Newcastle United in December 1986, a hat-trick in a FA Cup fourth round win at Sheffield Wednesday in January 1988 and a hat-trick against Wrexham in the League Cup during his final season on Merseyside.\n\nOldham Athletic paid £500,000 for Sharp just after their promotion to the First Division after a 68-year exile. He helped them finish 17th in 1991–92, ensuring that they would be members of the new Premier League. He helped them avoid relegation on goal difference in 1992–93, and reach the FA Cup semi-final a year later, although they were finally relegated to the new Division One at the end of the 1993–94 season.\n\nWhen Joe Royle quit as Oldham manager to take over at Everton in November 1994, Sharp took over as player-manager at Boundary Park and they finished in midtable in 1994–95 – a disappointing showing for a side who had retained all but one of their key players (Mike Milligan) from the side that had been relegated from the Premier League and reached an FA Cup semi-final. Further disappointment came in 1995–96 when Oldham finished 18th, and Sharp finally walked in March of 1996–97 with Oldham on the verge of their imminent relegation to Division Two.\n\nSharp was manager of Bangor City in the League of Wales for one season and led the club to a Welsh Cup victory in May 1998.\n\nSharp played 12 times for Scotland between 1985 and 1988. This included one appearance in the 1986 World Cup, in a goalless draw against Uruguay. Sharp scored one international goal, in a 1–1 draw with Malta.\n\nSharp now works for the local press in Liverpool and radio for 96.7 Radio City in the north-west of England and is currently one of the Everton Club Ambassadors alongside Ian Snodin and Graham Stuart.\n\n\n\n"}

He was also a civic and educational leader who represented Pennsylvania in the Continental Congress.\n\nWilliam was born to Joseph Shippen (1679–1741, son of Edward Shippen, governor of Pennsylvania) and Abigail Grosse Shippen (1677–1716) at Philadelphia. His father was a prominent merchant. He built a large practice in Philadelphia. In 1735 he married Susannah Harrison.\n\nShippen joined the vestrymen who founded the Second Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia in 1742. He joined Benjamin Franklin and other civic leaders to found the Public Academy in 1749 and served as one of its trustees. When it merged with another school to become the College of Philadelphia, he served as a trustee of the college from 1755 to 1779; the College is now the University of Pennsylvania. \n\nWhile teaching anatomy and surgery at the University of Pennsylvania, one of his pupils was future American president William Henry Harrison.\n\nWilliam's brother, Edward Shippen III (1703–1781, grandfather of Peggy Shippen) was one of the founders of Princeton University, for which William served as a trustee from 1765 to 1796.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Assembly chose Shippen as a delegate to the Continental Congress on November 20, 1778.

{"id": "2130020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2130020", "title": "Xenon 2: Megablast", "text": "Xenon 2: Megablast\n\nXenon 2: Megablast is a 1989 shoot 'em up video game developed by The Bitmap Brothers and published by Image Works for the Amiga and Atari ST. It was later converted to the Master System, Mega Drive, Commodore CDTV, Game Boy, Acorn Archimedes and Atari Jaguar platforms. The game is a sequel to \"Xenon\" and takes place a millennium after the previous title. The goal of the game is to destroy a series of bombs planted throughout history by the Xenites, the vengeful antagonists of the first game.\n\n\"Xenon 2: Megablast\" is the third major video game release by The Bitmap Brothers. Its subtitle is derived from the Bomb the Bass track \"Megablast (Hip Hop on Precinct 13)\", which serves as the game's theme music. The original release of \"Xenon 2: Megablast\" was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, with reviewers praising the detailed visuals, addictive gameplay, variety of weapons and innovative soundtrack.\n\n\"Xenon 2: Megablast\" is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up in which the player takes on the role of a starship pilot who must destroy five bombs planted throughout history by the villainous Xenites. The player controls the Megablaster, a small battlecraft that can move in multiple directions, is equipped with a raygun as an offensive measure, and is shielded from enemy attacks and collisions for a temporary period. The game is split into five scrolling levels ranging in theme from the Cambrian era to futuristic metallic spaceways. The levels are primarily inhabited by aggressive lifeforms that have been mutated by radiation emanating from the bombs planted at the end of each level. Attacks from these enemy characters will decrease the player's shield. If the shield is completely depleted, the ship will be destroyed by the next hit it sustains, and the player will lose a life. Each level contains six \"restart positions\", from which the ship will respawn at the most recent position passed if a life is lost. If all three lives are lost, the game ends prematurely. The shield can also sustain damage if the ship is trapped in a corner of the scenery and is crushed as the screen continues to scroll. The player can reverse the direction of the scrolling to a limited extent by pulling back on their directional input when the ship is at the bottom of the screen. A boss character is found at the end of each level and requires a specific strategy to destroy. When the boss is defeated, the bomb within the level will defuse. The first level only features one boss character, while the other four feature another boss at the level's halfway point.\n\nCapsules can occasionally be found within the levels, and release one of a variety of collectible tokens when destroyed. These tokens can augment the ship's weaponry or speed, restore a portion of the ship's shield, or allow the ship to dive into the background for a limited time. Destroyed enemies leave behind currency known as Real Cash, the quantity and value of which depending on the size of the enemy. Real Cash can be used to buy and sell tokens at \"Crispin's Swop Shop\", which the player can access twice per level. \"Xenon 2: Megablast\" is primarily single-player, but allows for two players to play intermittently.\n\n\"Xenon 2: Megablast\" was conceptualized and designed by The Bitmap Brothers (consisting of Mike Montgomery, Steve Kelly and Eric Matthews) and published by Image Works. It is the third major release by The Bitmap Brothers after \"Xenon\" and \"Speedball\". Matthews reckoned that \"everyone seems to be into destruction and extra weapons in a big way\", and sought to satisfy this demand with \"Xenon 2: Megablast\". The development team drew inspiration from \"Scramble\", \"Gradius\" and \"R-Type\", and attempted to deviate from the shoot 'em up formula by making the enemy characters less predictable and predetermined. The Megablaster's ability from the previous title to transform into a tank was omitted to make the gameplay more straightforward.\nThe game was programmed by The Assembly Line, who wrote the code on an IBM Personal Computer and then ported to an Atari ST. The graphics were created by Mark Coleman, who designed the visuals based on Matthews's brief descriptions using both DEGAS Elite and additional animation routines written by Montgomery. The audio was created by David Whittaker, who arranged the Bomb the Bass track \"Megablast (Hip Hop on Precinct 13)\" as the game's background score. The game's subtitle is derived from this track. The arrangement heard in the title screen includes the samples from the original version, while the arrangement heard during gameplay is slightly stripped down. The development team had been eager to include the track in a shoot 'em up game, with Matthews saying \"It's perfect music for a shoot 'em up. It's instrumental, which makes it relatively easy to reproduce on computer, and the title says it all.\" Rhythm King founder Martin Heath and Bomb the Bass headman Tim Simenon were both avid fans of computer games, and their favourable response resulted in \"Megablast\" being licensed for the game.\n\nAn early version of \"Xenon 2: Megablast\" was demonstrated on the Channel 4 programme \"Signals\" in mid-January 1989, and the game was formally announced in April. After an additional showing at a promotions event by Mirrorsoft in Amsterdam, \"Xenon 2: Megablast\" was released in September 1989. On that month, a promotional sweepstake was run by \"Computer and Video Games\" and Mirrorsoft in which contestants who filled and mailed a postcard were eligible to win the grand prize of a Discman and a copy of the Bomb the Bass album \"Into the Dragon\", from which the game's titular track originates. Ten second-prize winners received a copy of the game and a special limited-edition \"Xenon 2: Megablast\" t-shirt.\n\nThe Master System version of the game was programmed by Sean Cross and S. Green, was released in October 1991 and has a reduced level count from five to three. The Sega Genesis version was programmed by Delvin Sorrell and released in February 1992. The Master System and Mega Drive versions were published by Virgin Games. The Game Boy version was published by Mindscape and released in October 1992. A version for the Commodore CDTV, also programmed by Sorrell, was released in the same month, and includes a high fidelity remix of \"Megablast\" as well as voice acting for the character Crispin provided by Richard Joseph. A version for the SNES was announced the following month, but not released. A version for the Acorn Archimedes and other Acorn 32-bit machines was released in late 1993, published by GamesWare. On May 27, 2016, a version for the Atari Jaguar, created by AtariAge user Cyrano Jones, was released with Mike Montgomery's blessing. The Atari Jaguar version includes a new soundtrack composed by 505.\n\nThe Amiga and Atari ST versions of \"Xenon 2: Megablast\" were met with critical acclaim. Roland Waddilove of \"Atari ST User\" gave the game a perfect score and declared it to be one of the year's best vertically-scrolling shoot 'em ups, but stated that while the gameplay is \"fast and addictive\", it lacked originality in the face of a saturated shoot 'em up market. Stuart Wynne of \"Zzap!64\" lauded the game's difficulty, and said that while the gameplay was standard for its genre, the wide range of power-ups to enhance the ship with served as a vital difference. Warren Lapworth of \"The Games Machine\" deemed the game \"a superlative shoot-'em-up\" and \"a classing sounding, looking, and playing blaster, wholly deserving of the prefix 'Mega'\". He commended the shop feature as \"brilliantly presented and cleverly thought-out\" and the ability to reverse course as a \"great idea ... [that] helps transform an already highly playable shoot-'em-up into a classic, addictive one\". Paul Glancey of \"Computer and Video Games\" praised the gameplay, graphics and sound and called the game \"utterly superb\". Duncan MacDonald of \"Zero\" declared that the game \"is (to date) the DEFINITIVE vertical scrolling shoot 'em up\", while David McCandless of the same publication said that the game \"has the best music, graphics, gameplay and doner kebabs this side of Crewe\". MacDonald noted that the \"add-on weapons\" system was \"awesome\", and both he and McCandless felt that the \"restart position\" system kept the learning curve and difficulty at a reasonable level. Brian Nesbitt of \"The One\" commended the game's variety of weapons, and felt that the game \"will undoubtedly have the same effect on the games scene as its predecessor did over a year ago\". Pete Connor of \"ACE\" decided that the game \"is one of the most accomplished shoot-em-ups you're likely to come across this side of Christmas\", and that the challenge provided by the amount of detail and action balanced out the low amount of levels. Gary Barrett of \"ST Format\" called the game \"extremely addictive and exciting\" in spite of its lack of new concepts, and considered it to be \"in the same elite class as \"Blood Money\"\". Tony Horgan of \"Amiga User International\" was grateful for the feature of retaining weapons after losing a life, which he felt made the game's balance \"perfect\". Mike Pattenden of \"Commodore User\" observed that \"\"Xenon II\" pursues the relentless quest for an arcade quality shoot'em up on the Amiga, and it's probably the closest yet.\" However, he felt that the slow scroll rate induced an element of tedium, and that the lack of variation held back the strength of the game's challenge. The loading times between levels and the Swop Shop were criticized.\n\nWaddilove highlighted the detailed sprites and parallax scrolling backgrounds. Wynne described the game's visual themes as \"imaginative and unique\", and proclaimed that the \"well nigh perfect\" animation \"sets a new standard in presentation\". Lapworth described the game as \"a truly awesome sight\" and praised the sprites as \"imaginative and conception and brilliant in execution\", the enemy designs as \"pleasingly vicious\" and the colours and textures as \"realistic and highly impressive\". MacDonald considered the artwork and animation to be \"as good as anyone could ask for\"; he pointed out the abundant colours, the depth granted to the backgrounds by the parallax scrolling, and the \"sheer genius\" design and animation of the enemy sprites. McCandless also spoke highly of the visuals; he proclaimed the game to have \"simply the best graphics this side of the arcade\", felt that the enemy designs were \"realistic and seriously hateable\", and expressed surprise at the amount of animated details such as the weapons and items. Connor called the game \"one of the prettiest you're likely to see on the ST this year\", and described the graphics as \"colourful, smooth and fast\". Barrett said that the game's \"superior\" graphics boosted the presentation of the enemy and weapon sprites. Pattenden praised the graphics as \"superb\" and \"definitely arcade quality\", and singled out the backgrounds and colour schemes as \"brilliant\".\n\nWaddilove commended the soundtrack as \"very professionally performed\", and observed that the game's explosions and zaps make the game \"noisy but fun\". Wynne of \"Zzap!64\" deemed the arrangement of \"Megablast\" \"impressive\", while Robin Hogg of the same publication was unenthusiastic for the choice of in-game music and voiced a preference for heavy metal. Lapworth considered Whittaker's re-sequenced version of \"Megablast\" to be \"an excellent soundtrack\", but expressed disappointment at the arrangement of the Atari ST version, which consisted of \"very ordinary in-game spot effects\". McCandless declared the soundtrack to be \"nothing short of awesome\", and said that \"the entire game is worth buying just for the intro\". Nesbitt said that \"from the moment the incredible David Whittaker reconstruction of Bomb the Bass' Megablast bursts into life, you know you are in for something special.\" Connor called the soundtrack \"superb\" and remarked that \"you can hear every last scratch, yelp, and shriek as the sound chip works overtime.\" Horgan commended the game's theme as \"brilliant\". Pattenden felt that the game's mix of \"Megablast\" was \"every bit as potent as the original cut\".\n\nThe Amiga and Atari ST versions topped the Gallup sales charts for their respective consoles in their debut month, and stayed within the Top 20 charts for the next three months. \"ST Format\" included the game in its \"50 Games of the Year\", saying that \"Flawless graphics, nightmarish wriggly sprites, and instantaneous addiction made it the gamester's rave of the year.\" In a subsequent issue, \"ST Format\" ranked the game at #30 in its \"30 Kick-Ass Classics\" and declared it to be the definitive vertical-scrolling shoot-'em-up, but simultaneously identified it as the genre's \"death\", remarking that \"the Bitmaps milked what credibility remained\" and that \"nothing else could follow it\". \"ST Format\" later ranked the game as the #1 shoot-'em-up in its \"Top 50 Games of 1990\", and observed that it was \"for many the high point of shoot-'em-ups; for others, the one that killed 'em\". The game was ranked the 33rd best Amiga game of all time by \"Amiga Power\".\n\nThe Sega versions were assessed positively by \"Mean Machines\". Julian Rignall and Richard Leadbetter both praised the Master System version's graphics as some of the best on the console, and considered the gameplay to be as addictive as its 16-bit counterparts due to the variety of weapons, though Leadbetter felt that the pace of the gameplay was slow and that the sound effects were lacking. Rignall and Leadbetter also complimented the visuals of the Mega Drive version, but were disappointed by the jerky scrolling and poor musical arrangement. Damien Noonan of \"Amiga Format\" rated the Commodore CDTV version a paltry 32%, commenting that, while innovative at the time it was first released, the game had aged poorly and its gameplay was not well-balanced. In a middling review of the Game Boy version, \"Nintendo Power\" spoke positively of the mechanic of buying weapons to upgrade the ship and the challenge provided by the enemies approaching from all sides, but criticized the slow speed of the ship and the absence of continuous firing.\n\n"}

He studied the writings of Karl Marx and became a member of the illegal Communist League until 1852. Miquel was in close correspondence with Marx and active in the Revolutions of 1848–1849.\n\nIn 1850 he settled down to practise as an advocate at Göttingen and began to distance himself from the communist labour movement . He acquired a reputation as an able lawyer and rising politician, especially for his knowledge of financial questions. He was one of the founders of the German National Association, and in 1864 he was elected a member of the Hanoverian parliament as a Liberal and an opponent of the government. He accepted the annexation of Hanover by Prussia without regret, and was one of the Hanoverians whose parliamentary abilities at once won a commanding position in the Prussian parliament, which he entered in 1867.\n\nFor some reason, perhaps because Bismarck did not entirely trust him, he did not at this time attain quite so influential a position as might have been anticipated; nevertheless he was chairman of the parliamentary committee which in 1876 drafted the new rules of legal procedure, and he found scope for his great administrative abilities in the post of mayor of Osnabrück. He held this position from 1865 to 1870, and again from 1876 to 1879, having in the meantime moved to Berlin, where he was first a director of the Discontogesellschaft (1870–1873), and then a member of its advisory board (1873-1876).\n\nIn 1879, he was elected Lord Mayor of Frankfurt am Main, where he gained a great reputation for the energy with which he dealt with social questions, especially that of the housing of the poor. This office also made him a member of the Prussian House of Lords. Probably owing to his early study of socialism, he was very ready to support the new social reforms of Bismarck. He was the chief agent in the reorganization of the National Liberal Party in 1887, in which year he entered the imperial Reichstag.\n\nAfter Bismarck's fall in 1890, he was chosen Prussian minister of finance, and held this post for ten years. He distinguished himself by his reform of the Prussian system of taxation, the one really successful measure of the new reign in internal affairs. An attempt, however, to reform the system of imperial finance in 1893-1894 failed, and much injured his reputation. Miquel had entirely given up his Liberalism, and aimed at practical measures for improving the condition of the people irrespective of the party programmes; yet some of his measures, such as that for taxing \"Warenhäuser\" (\"stores\"), were of a very injudicious nature. He professed to aim at a union of parties on the basis of the satisfaction of material interests, a policy to which the name of \"Sammlung\" (\"Collective\") was given; but his enemies accused him of constantly intriguing against the three chancellors under whom he served, and of himself attempting to secure the chancellorship.\n\nThe sympathy that he expressed for the Agrarians increased his unpopularity among Liberals and industrials; but he pointed out that the state, which for half a century had done everything to help manufactures, might now attempt to support the failing industry of agriculture. By playing somewhat into the hands of the Agrarians, he secured the adoption of a new tax system, which greatly benefited the working classes and at the same time tremendously increased the revenue. In June 1901, the rejection of a canal bill led to a crisis, and he was obliged to send in his resignation. His health was already failing, and he died on 8 September of the same year at his house in Frankfurt.\n\nThe German Emperor conferred upon him the patent of nobility (enabling him to adopt the \"von\" in front of his last name) in 1897, and conferred upon him the Order of the Black Eagle.\n\n"}

{"id": "2130072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2130072", "title": "Cathedral of St. Sophia, Novgorod", "text": "Cathedral of St. Sophia, Novgorod\n\nThe Cathedral of St. Sophia (the Holy Wisdom of God) in Veliky Novgorod is the cathedral church of the Archbishop of Novgorod and the mother church of the Novgorodian Eparchy.\n\nThe 38-metre-high, five-domed, stone cathedral was built by Vladimir of Novgorod between 1045 and 1050 to replace an oaken cathedral also built by Bishop Joachim the Korsunian in the late tenth century (making it the oldest church building in Russia proper and, with the exception of the Arkhyz and Shoana churches, the oldest building of any kind still in use in the country). It was consecrated by Bishop Luka Zhidiata (1035–1060) on September 14, in 1050 or 1052, the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross. (A fresco just inside the south entrance depicts Sts. Constantine and Helena, who found the true cross in the fourth century; it is one of the oldest works of art in the cathedral and is thought to commemorate its dedication.) While it is commonly known as St. Sophia's, it is not named for any of the female saints of that name (i.e., Sophia of Rome or Sophia the Martyr); rather, the name comes from the Greek for wisdom (, from whence we get words like philo\"sophia\" or philosophy—\"the love of wisdom\"), and thus Novgorod's cathedral is dedicated to the Holy Wisdom of God, in imitation of the Hagia Sophia cathedral of Constantinople. It replaced an even older wooden, 13-domed church built in or around 989 by Bishop Ioakim Korsunianin, the first bishop of Novgorod. The main, golden cupola, was gilded by Archbishop Ioann (1388–1415) in 1408. The sixth (and the largest) dome crowns a tower which leads to the upper galleries. In medieval times these were said to hold the Novgorodian treasury and there was a library there, said to have been started by Yaroslav the Wise. When the library was moved to the St. Petersburg Spiritual Academy in 1859, it numbered more than 1,500 volumes, some dating back to the 13th century. The current Archbishop, Lev (Nikolai L'vovich Tserpitskii), has reestablished a library there, in keeping with the ancient tradition. As of 2004, it housed some 5,000 volumes. A Sunday school is also held in the gallery.\nThe cupolas are thought to have acquired their present helmet-like shape in the 1150s, when the cathedral was restored after a fire. The interior was painted in 1108 at the behest of Bishop Nikita (1096–1108), although the project was not undertaken until shortly after his death. Archbishop Nifont (1130–1156) had the exterior whitewashed and had the Martirievskii and Pretechenskaia porches (\"papter\"', more akin to side chapels) painted sometime during his tenure, but those frescoes are hardly visible now in consequence of frequent fires. In the 1860s, parts of the interior had to be repainted and most of the current frescoes are from the 1890s. A white stone belltower in five bays was built by Archbishop Evfimii II (1429–1458), the greatest architectural patron to ever hold the archiepiscopal office. He also had the Palace of Facets built just northwest of the cathedral in 1433. The nearby clocktower was initially completed under his patronage as well, but fell down in the seventeenth century and was restored in 1673.\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century, the cathedral was a ceremonial and spiritual centre of the Novgorod Republic, which sprawled from the Baltic Sea to the Ural Mountains. Novgorodians were exceedingly proud of their church, boasting that they were willing \"to lay down their heads for Holy Wisdom\" or \"to die honorably for Holy Wisdom.\" When one prince angered them, they told him \"we have no prince, only God, the Truth, and Holy Wisdom.\" On another occasion, they made the cathedral the symbol of the city itself, saying \"Where Holy Wisdom is, there is Novgorod.\"\nThe cathedral has long been the city's great necropolis, the burial place of 47 people of prominence in the city's history, including several princes and posadniks and 32 bishops, archbishops, and metropolitans of Novgorod. The first burial there was Prince Vladimir himself in 1052. The first bishop was Luka Zhidiata in 1060. The last burial in the cathedral was Metropolitan Gurii in 1912. Most of the burials are below the floor in the Martirievskaia Porch, on the south side of the cathedral, named for Bishop Martirii (1193–1199). Later burials took place (again below the floor) in the Pretechenskaia Papter' on the north side of the cathedral. Today, there are several burials in the main body of the church. The sarcophagi of Prince Vladimir and Princess Anna overlook the Martirievskaia Porch; Archbishop Ilya (also known as Ioann) (1165–1186) is buried in the northwestern corner of the main body of the church, next to the Pretechenskaia Porch. Bishop Nikita lies in a glass-covered sarcaphogus between the chapels of the Nativity of the Mother of God and Sts. Ioakim and Anne and the sarcophagus is opened on his feast days (January 30, the day of his death and April 30/May 13, the day of the \"uncovering of his relics,\" i.e., when his tomb was opened in 1558) so the faithful can venerate his relics. Two other princes also lie in the main body of the cathedral and in the Chapel of the Nativity of the Mother of God.\n\nThe cathedral was looted by Ivan the Terrible's Oprichnina in the 1570s but restored by Archbishop Leonid (1572–1575). He built the Tsar's Pew which stands just inside the south entrance of the main body of the cathedral near the Martirievskii Porch. Leonid also had several large chandeliers hung in the cathedral, but only one of them survives.\n\nBeginning in the eighteenth century, the archbishops or metropolitans of Novgorod lived in St. Petersburg (they were known as archbishops or metropolitans of Novgorod and St. Petersburg). Thus, while Novgorod technically still had a prelate, he was not often active in the city itself, and the church in the city was administered by a vicar bishop for much of the time. Twelve metropolitans of Novgorod and St. Petersburg (or Leningrad) are buried in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra in St. Petersburg, rather than in the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom.\n\nDuring the Nazi occupation of Novgorod, the Kremlin was heavily damaged from the battles and from the Nazi abuse. However, the cathedral itself survived. The large cross on the main dome (which has a metal bird attached to it, perhaps symbolic of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove) was removed by Spanish infantry. For over 60 years it resided in the Madrid's Military Engineering Academy Museum, until November 16, 2004 when it was handed over back to the Russian Orthodox Church by the Spanish brothers Miguel Ángel and Fernando Garrido Polonio who discovered the Cross in a military camp in Madrid. The domes were heavily damaged in the war, and the large Christ Pantocrator in the dome was ruined. According to legend, the painters painted him with a clenched fist. The archbishop told them to repaint Christ with an open palm, and when they returned the next morning, the hand was miraculously clenched again. After repeated efforts, a voice from the dome is said to have told the archbishop to leave the painting alone for as long as Christ's fist remained closed, he would hold the fate of Novgorod in his hand.\n\nDuring the Soviet period, the cathedral was a museum. It was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1991. An inscription on the north wall of the west entrance attests to its rededication by Bishop Lev and Patriarch Alexius II.\n\nNovgorod's St. Sophia was the first Slavic church in which local divergences from Byzantine pattern were made so evident. With its austere walls, narrow windows, the church is redolent of Romanesque architecture of Western Europe, rather than of Greek churches built at that time.\n\nThe Novgorod cathedral also differs strikingly from its namesake and contemporary in Kiev. As one art historian put it, the Kiev cathedral is a bride, whereas the Novgorod cathedral is a warrior. Its decoration is minimal, the use of brick is limited, and the masses are arranged vertically rather than horizontally. These features proved to be influential with Novgorod masters of the next generation, as the Yuriev Monastery Cathedral (1119) and the Antoniev Monastery Cathedral (1117) clearly show. \n\nThe oldest icon in the cathedral is probably the Icon of the Mother of God of the Sign, which according to legend miraculously saved Novgorod in 1169 when the Suzdalians attacked the city; it was brought out of the Church of the Transfiguration on Il'ina Street and displayed in the cathedral and on the walls of the city by Archbishop Ilya. The Church of the Icon Mother of God of the Sign was built next to the Church of the Transfiguration in the seventeenth century to house the icon. During the Soviet period, it was housed in the nearby Novgorod Museum (as were the bones of Bishop Nikita, said to have been kept in a paper bag until they were transferred to the Church of Sts. Philip and Nicholas in 1957); the icon was returned to the cathedral in the early 1990s and stands just to the right of the Golden Doors of the iconostasis. The icon of Sophia, the Holy Wisdom of God, is also quite old and is part of the iconostasis just to the right of the Golden Doors as well (where the icon of the saint to which the church is dedicated usually hangs). Several icons were said to have been painted or commissioned by Archbishop Vasilii Kalika (1330–1352) and Archbishop Iona (1458–1470) and Archbishop Makarii (1526–1542) (he went on to become Metropolitan of Moscow and All Rus') is said to have painted the icons in the small iconostasis in the Chapel of the Nativity of the Mother of God (the iconostasis originally stood in the Chapel of Sts. Ioakim and Anne, just to the left of its present location.\nThree famous sets of gates adorned the cathedral over the centuries; they are known as the Korsun, Vasilii, and Sigtuna (or Płock, or Magdeburg) Gates. The Korsun Gates hang at the western entrance to the Chapel of the Nativity of the Mother of God at the southeast corner of the cathedral. They were said to have been brought to Novgorod by Bishop Ioakim Korsunianin, whose name indicates ties to Korsun in Crimea. The Vasilii Gates, were donated to the cathedral in 1335 by Archbishop Vasilii Kalika and were taken by Tsar Ivan IV to his residence in Alexandrov near Moscow following the looting of the cathedral in 1570, where they still may be seen. They influenced artwork in the Moscow Kremlin executed under Ivan the Terrible. The doors at the west entrance (intended to be the main entrance to the cathedral, although the main one is now the northern entrance), called the Sigtuna, Magdeburg or Płock Gates, are said to have been looted by Novgorodian forces from the Swedish town of Sigtuna in 1187. In fact, they were most probably wrought and sculptured by Magdeburg masters, most likely in years 1152–1154, for the Archbishop of Płock in Poland (where they were decorating one of the entrances into the Cathedral in Płock for around 250 years).\nThe gates were acquired by the Novgorodians most probably in the end of the 15th century, probably by Archbishop Evfimii II, who loved Western art (as can be seen in the Gothic style incorporated into the Palace of Facets) or—according to another theory—in the first half of the 15th century by duke of Novgorod and brother of the Polish king, Simeon Lingwen. It is not known precisely how the Novgorodians acquired the Płock Gates—most probably they were a gift from Archbishops of Płock or the dukes of Mazovia for the brother of Polish-Lithuanian King Władysław Jagiełło, Lithuanian Duke Lengvenis, or for Archbishop Evfimii II. There is also another theory that the gates had been looted from the cathedral in Płock by pagan Lithuanians in the thirteenth century, and later somehow made their way to Novgorod. The first theory is considered the most likely. The Magdeburg or Płock Gates (sometimes also wrongly called the Sigtuna Gates) are opened only twice a year for special occasions, although some reports say that they are opened when the archbishop himself leads the Divine Liturgy. Since 1982, copies of the Gates, a gift from Novgorod, hang in the Cathedral in Płock.\n"}

Owned by Allen Media Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Los Angeles-based Entertainment Studios, it is a sister station to low-powered NBC affiliate KLAF-LD (channel 46), which is simulcast on its second digital subchannel. The two stations share studios on Eraste Landry Road in Lafayette; KADN's transmitter is located south of Church Point, in rural Acadia Parish.\n\nOn cable, KADN is available on Cox Communications channel 6 in standard definition and on digital channel 1006 in high definition.\n\nChannel 15 in Lafayette was originally home to KLNI-TV (licensed to Lafayette and New Iberia), which operated as an NBC affiliate beginning on September 16, 1968. It was owned by Southwestern Louisiana Communications, Inc., and it was the first TV station built in southwestern Louisiana to broadcast in full color. Like other NBC affiliates in the region, it temporarily brought PBS programming, specifically \"Sesame Street\", to the Acadiana area from 1970 until 1972. However, Lafayette was just barely large enough at the time to support three full network affiliates. KLNI-TV, a UHF station, found it difficult to compete against longer-established KATC-TV (channel 3) and KLFY-TV (channel 10). It did not help matters that WBRZ-TV in Baton Rouge and KPLC-TV in Lake Charles both provided strong grade B coverage to most of the market. After suffering financial difficulties for most of its existence, KLNI discontinued operations on February 21, 1975. This left WBRZ (and later WRBT, now WVLA) and KPLC as the region's \"de facto\" NBC affiliates; the latter was carried by most cable providers in south-central Louisiana. The allocation for channel 15 in Lafayette as a commercial TV station remained after the demise of KLNI-TV, but the frequency stayed dark for the next five years.\n\nKADN-TV, the current incarnation of channel 15, began broadcasting on March 1, 1980 as an independent station, offering mainly movies, old sitcoms, children's programming, and local sports. It was owned by Charles Chatelain and his company, Delta Media Corporation. The station used the on-air slogan \"Acadiana's Alternative,\" and also called itself \"The Movie Station.\"\n\nUnusually for an independent station in what, then as now, was a fairly small market, KADN was innovative in creating its own original programming. It gained particular notice for its music programming. Shows such as \"The Larry Brasso Show\" (country music), \"Cypress with Warren Storm\" (swamp pop) and the long-running \"Laissez Les Bon Temps Rouler\" (Cajun French music) were Saturday mainstays during the station's early years. The latter program also aired in reruns aired weekday mornings under the title \"Bon Temps Rouler Encore\". A music video hour aired daily called \"Acadiana Music Box\" around the same time MTV was catching on.\n\nAlso in the early years, KADN had its own news department, first with five-minute newsbreaks and then its own 5:00 p.m. daily newscast called \"Acadiana in Review\". After just a couple of years, station management realized that it was not financially feasible to compete with KLFY and KATC in news, so the news department was eliminated.\n\nShortly after KADN signed on the air, KLFY preempted an episode of the popular prime-time drama series \"Dallas\" to run a Billy Graham televangelism special. Chatelain persuaded CBS to let KADN clear the episode. At that time, an arrangement was made for channel 15 to officially become a CBS secondary affiliate, picking up a microwave relay of WAFB in Baton Rouge for network programming. KADN then began airing any CBS programming that KLFY preempted for one reason or another, especially the morning daytime offerings from 9–10 a.m. (KADN would re-air those shows in the afternoon.) The arrangement lasted until 2005, with preempted CBS programming running in the later years on sister station KLAF-LP.\n\nKADN-TV is a charter member of Fox, having joined the network upon its debut in October 1986.\n\nFrom the late 1980s to 1997, KADN operated a low-powered semi-satellite in Alexandria, K47DW, to bring Fox programming to central Louisiana. It aired separate commercials for the Alexandria market, identifying as \"Fox 47\". In 1991, when Delta Media bought WNTZ in Natchez, the Fox affiliation moved to channel 48. The channel 47 translator then simulcast WNTZ to serve portions of Alexandria where channel 48's signal was weak.\n\nIn 1997, Communications Corporation of America (ComCorp) began operating KADN in 1997 through a leased marketing agreement with original owner Charles Chatelain until purchasing the station outright in late 2004. After being located on cable channel 8 since sign-on, KADN moved to channel 6 on August 15, 2006 as part of a lineup restructuring of the Cox Communications Greater Lafayette system. \n\nIn June 2006, owner ComCorp filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ComCorp said in a press release viewers and staff would see no changes at the station. ComCorp emerged from bankruptcy in October 2007.\n\nThe programming of sister station KLAF-LP was added to KADN-DT's signal on channel 15.2 in August 2007. This began a period of transition in which all four translators that made up KLAF were shut off.\n\nIn early 2008, KADN became the first station in the Lafayette market to air high-definition programming outside of network-provided offerings with syndicated reruns of \"Two and a Half Men\" airing in 720p HD. Further, on February 29, 2008, KADN began airing promotional materials throughout the day in 720p HD and identifying on the HD signal as \"Fox 15 HD\".\n\nKADN-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 15, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 16. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 15.\n\nOn April 24, 2013, ComCorp announced the sale of its entire group (including flagship KADN and sister station KLAF-LD) to Nexstar Broadcasting Group. The sale was completed on January 1, 2015.\n\nOn May 7, 2015, Nexstar Broadcasting announced that KLAF-LD, which simulcasts on KADN-TV's DT2 channel, would be the new NBC affiliate for the Lafayette market effective July 1, 2015. They also announced that on that same date, KADN-TV would launch a third subchannel and move KLAF-LD's former MyNetworkTV affiliation there.\n\nOn January 27, 2016, Nexstar announced it would acquire Media General for $4.6 billion. Since Media General already owns CBS affiliate KLFY-TV, and since the Lafayette market is too small to allow duopolies in any case, in order to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as planned changes to rules regarding same-market television stations which would prohibit future joint sales agreements, the company was required to sell either KLFY or KADN to another company. KLAF-LD was the only station involved in the deal that could be legally acquired, since FCC rules allow for the common ownership of full-power and low-power stations in the same market, regardless of the number of stations in that market. On May 27, 2016, Nexstar announced that it would keep KLFY-TV and sell KADN-TV and KLAF-LD to Bayou City Broadcasting for $40 million. The sale was finalized January 17, 2017. Upon completion of the sale, it reunited KADN and KLAF-LD with WEVV-TV in Evansville, Indiana, which Bayou City bought from Nexstar when it acquired ComCorp in January 2015.\n\nOn May 6, 2019, it was announced that Entertainment Studios through its Allen Media Broadcasting would purchase the Bayou City stations (including KADN-TV) for $165 million. The sale was completed on July 31, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\nOn March 26, 2007, KADN began running on-air promos teasing a 9:00 p.m. newscast with the tagline \"At 9 it's news, by 10 it's history.\"\n\n\"Fox News Louisiana\" was produced by Baton Rouge Fox affiliate WGMB. Originally, the first 20 minutes of the program were taped earlier and geared specifically towards the Acadiana audience, with stories by Lafayette-based reporters, plus a local forecast. KADN then joined WGMB's live broadcast for the final two segments, which included generic national and world news, plus a statewide sportscast. In 2008, the newscast was retitled \"Fox News Lafayette\", although the former branding (\"Fox News Louisiana\") was not removed from the set.\n\nOn August 20, 2007, KADN debuted \"Fox News Louisiana AM\", a 7 to 9 a.m. newscast. Like the evening news, certain segments were taped and included stories by the Lafayette-based reporting staff, while other segments were aired live. In December 2008, \"Fox News Louisiana AM\" was canceled.\n\nIn April 2009, KADN canceled its 30-minute evening newscast and let go of its local news staff. KADN then aired \"Fox News Now\" at 9 p.m., a five-minute newscast featuring local headlines and a weather forecast. This was expanded to a full half-hour and renamed \"Fox15 News Lafayette\" when KADN's DT2 signal, simulcasting KLAF-LD, launched its news department on April 1, 2016. Until that time, KLAF-LD simulcast newscasts from Baton Rouge-based NBC affiliate WVLA-TV, which Nexstar operates under a SSA with White Knight Broadcasting.\n\nOn April 3, 2017, KADN/KLAF unveiled a refurbished news set, adopted the current \"News 15\" branding, and dropped the \"Acadiana's KLAF\" branding for KLAF and KADN 15.2. KADN 15.1 airs newscasts from 5–9 a.m. daily (except on weekends) and 9 p.m. nightly seven days a week. NBC 15.2 airs newscasts at noon, 5, 6, and 10 p.m. on weekdays, and 10 p.m. only on weekends. KADN 15.2 continues to be a simulcast of KLAF 46.1.\n\n"}

Early on he joined the Swedish Social Democratic Party's youth organization, the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League. In 1917, Flyg took part in the founding of a new leftist party, a group headed by Zeth Höglund and Karl Kilbom, which would soon become the Communist Party of Sweden.\n\nFlyg became an important leader of the Communist Party, wrote books and went on political trips to the Soviet Union. In the general election of 1928, with the Flyg-dominated Communists cooperating with the dominant Social Democratic Party, he failed to achieve an influential position as voters failed to show substantial support for a Communist-Social Democratic coalition. In 1929 Flyg, along with the majority of the party's membership, was accused of insufficient loyalty to the Soviet-dominated Comintern and expelled from the party. The same year Flyg and Kilbom founded a new, parallel Communist Party, which claimed to be the real Communist Party of Sweden.\n\nInitially Flyg and Kilbom attempted to reconcile with the Comintern, something that soon proved fruitless. They gradually developed an animosity towards Stalinism. By 1934 the party had changed name to the Socialist Party (\"Socialistiska partiet\"). At first, the Socialist Party still supported the Soviet Union but condemned the Stalinist leadership. But by the end of the 1930s, the party had changed its view and criticized the whole of the Soviet Union, a stance that gradually developed to a foreign policy embracing Nazi Germany.\n\nIn 1937 Kilbom was expelled from the party after a few years of disputes and personal struggle between the two leaders. After the expulsion of Kilbom a majority of the members of the party left. The Socialist Party shrank dramatically and Flyg became more and more politically isolated.\n\nAt the beginning of World War II, Flyg came out in opposition to fascism, and the Nazi-Soviet pact in his eyes proved that Stalinism was just as bad as fascism. But when Hitler broke the pact with Stalin, and Germany launched the invasion against the Soviet Union, Flyg decided that he had to support the Nazis against Stalin, hoping it would lead to the end of Stalinism. Financial constraints led him to approach the German High Commission in Stockholm. Initially, the Germans turned down his request for funding, but in the final stages of the war (when the Germans felt a more urgent need for allies in the Swedish politics) funding was granted. Gradually, Flyg and his party developed a pro-Nazi position.\n\nStill, Nils Flyg never fully gave in to Hitlerism. He was neither an adherent of core fascist or racist policies, and considered himself a socialist until his death. He was against capitalism and imperialism and openly supported the basic ideas of Marx and Lenin. In one speech to a group of Swedish Nazis, he caused confusion when he declared: \"Death to communism! Long live communism!\".\n"}

He rose to prominence following his starring role as Michael Scofield in the Fox series \"Prison Break\", for which he received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama in 2005. He made his screenwriting debut with the 2013 thriller film \"Stoker\". In 2014, he began playing Leonard Snart / Captain Cold in a recurring role on The CW series \"The Flash\" before becoming a series regular on the spin-off, \"Legends of Tomorrow\".\n\nMiller was born in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England, to American parents. His mother, Roxann (née Palm), is a special education teacher, and his father, Wentworth E. Miller II, is a lawyer and teacher, who was studying at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship at the time of Miller's birth. Miller said in 2003 that his father is black and his mother is white. His father is of African-American, Jamaican, German, and English ancestry; his mother is of Russian, Swedish, French, Dutch, Syrian, and Lebanese ancestry.\n\nMiller's family moved to Park Slope, Brooklyn, when he was a year old. He attended Midwood High School in Brooklyn, and graduated from Princeton University in 1995 with a bachelor's degree in English literature. While at Princeton, he performed with the a cappella group the Princeton Tigertones and was a member of the Quadrangle Club and the Colonial Club.\n\nIn 1995, Miller relocated to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. He has stated that his rocky road to stardom \"was a long time in the coming and there were a lot of upsets and a lot of failures and roadblocks, but I couldn't walk away from it. I needed it like I needed air, it was just something I had to do.\" Miller's first TV appearance was as student-turned-sea monster Gage Petronzi on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (\"Go Fish\", 1998).\n\nMiller's first starring role was in 2002 as the sensitive, introverted David Scott in ABC's mini-series \"Dinotopia\". After appearing in a few minor television roles, he moved on to co-star in the 2003 film \"The Human Stain\", playing the younger version of the Anthony Hopkins character, Coleman Silk. He identified strongly with the core dilemma of the movie, about a black man who chooses to \"pass\" as white. Miller worked extensively on the role, not only in researching Anthony Hopkins, but by embarking on a four-month regimen to accurately portray Silk as a boxer. Also in 2003, he had a minor role in the film \"Underworld\", playing a doctor and friend of the character Michael Corvin.\n\nIn 2005, Miller was cast as Michael Scofield in Fox Network's television drama \"Prison Break\". He played the role of a gifted structural engineer who created an elaborate scheme to help his brother, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), escape death row after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit. His character had a full upper body (front and back) tattoo. Covering both the front of Miller's torso and his back, along with both arms from shoulders to wrists, the special effects for the tattoo took over four hours to apply. His performance in the show earned him a 2005 Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series. The show was finished in 2009 after four seasons, but a new nine-episode fifth season was released April 4, 2017, with Miller reprising his role.\n\nMiller appeared in two Mariah Carey music videos, \"It's Like That\" as a party guest and \"We Belong Together\" as her love interest. Director Brett Ratner, who directed the pilot episode of \"Prison Break\", was also signed on to direct the two Carey videos. Ratner decided to use Miller in the videos as well.\n\nIn addition, Miller guest-starred in the Season 11 premiere of \"\" as Detective Nate Kendall, a detective from Precinct 24 of the New York City Police Department. He also featured in \"\", the fourth film in the commercially successful \"Resident Evil\" film series based on the video game series of the same name; Miller plays Chris Redfield, one of the protagonists of the video game series.\n\nMiller wrote the screenplay for the film \"Stoker\", as well as a prequel to \"Stoker\", \"Uncle Charlie\". He used the pseudonym Ted Foulke, later explaining, \"I just wanted the scripts to sink or swim on their own.\" Miller's script was voted to the 2010 \"Black List\" of the 10 best unproduced screenplays then making the rounds in Hollywood. The film is about a teenage girl who must deal with a mysterious uncle following the death of her father. Miller described it as a \"horror film, a family drama and a psychological thriller\". Although influenced by Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", Miller has clarified that \"Stoker\" is not a vampire story. Hitchcock's \"Shadow of a Doubt\" also influenced the film but only as a jumping-off point, from which the story takes a different direction. Park Chan-wook directed, with stars Mia Wasikowska as the teenager, Nicole Kidman as the mother, and Matthew Goode as the uncle. The film was released in 2013, and received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\nIn July 2014, it was announced that Miller had joined the cast of The CW superhero series \"The Flash\" in a recurring role as Leonard Snart / Captain Cold. He made his first appearance in the fourth episode of the first season, and reprised his role on \"Legends of Tomorrow\". These shows reunited him with his \"Prison Break\" co-star Dominic Purcell, who portrayed Mick Rory / Heat Wave. Miller exited \"Legends of Tomorrow\" as a series regular at the end of season one, but signed a contract with Warner Bros. TV to continue portraying Snart simultaneously on multiple shows in the Arrowverse.\n\nMiller wrote the screenplay for the 2016 horror film \"The Disappointments Room\", produced by Voltage Pictures and Killer Films. The film received negative reviews from critics. He is reportedly in negotiations to write the screenplay adaptation of the novel \"The Story of Edgar Sawtelle\" by David Wroblewski which is set to be produced by Oprah Winfrey and Tom Hanks among others.\n\nMiller lives in Vancouver, British Columbia. He has two sisters, Leigh and Gillian. He holds dual British and US citizenship by virtue of his birth in the United Kingdom to American parents.\n\nIn 2007, Miller denied to \"InStyle\" magazine that he was gay. However, he came out as gay in August 2013, when he posted a letter on GLAAD's website declining an invitation to attend the Saint Petersburg International Film Festival because he felt \"deeply troubled\" by the Russian government's treatment of its gay citizens (referring to the Russian LGBT propaganda law, enacted the previous June, which banned \"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations\"). Miller wrote that he \"cannot in good conscience participate in a celebratory occasion hosted by a country where people like myself are being systematically denied their basic right to live and love openly\".\n\nAt the 2013 Human Rights Campaign Dinner in Seattle, Washington, Miller said he had attempted suicide multiple times as a teenager before coming out as gay. He stated: \"When someone asked me if that was a cry for help, I said no, because I told no one. You only cry for help if you believe there's help to cry for.\" He discussed struggling in Hollywood as a closeted actor, and talked about how his involvement in the ManKind Project helped him learn about brotherhood, sisterhood, and being part of a community.\n\nIn a 2016 Facebook post, he revealed that he \"[had] struggled with depression since childhood. It's a battle that's cost [him] time, opportunities, relationships, and a thousand sleepless nights.\" He made this emotional post in reaction to a meme of himself which poked fun at his weight gain in 2010. Miller said that his weight gain was due to him finding comfort in food as he was suicidal. Near the end of the post he provided links for organizations such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Active Minds\".\"\n\nOn October 17, 2016, Active Minds, a mental health charity, announced that Miller would be an ambassador for the organization.\n\n"}

He attended Stanford University, where he received a BA in 1991 and then a master's degree a year later. He studied abroad at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship, before attending Yale Law School. He won an upset victory for a seat on the Municipal Council of Newark in 1998, where he staged a 10-day hunger strike and briefly lived in a tent to draw attention to urban development issues in the city. He ran for mayor in 2002, but lost to incumbent Sharpe James; he ran again in 2006 and won against deputy mayor Ronald Rice. His first term saw to the doubling of affordable housing under development and the reduction of the city budget deficit from $180 million to $73 million. He was re-elected in 2010. He ran against Steve Lonegan in the 2013 U.S. Senate special election and subsequently won reelection in 2014 against Jeff Bell.\n\nAn advocate of social liberalism, Booker supports women's rights, affirmative action, same-sex marriage and single-payer healthcare. During his five years in office, Booker co-sponsored and voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (2013), tougher sanctions against Iran, the Bipartisan Budget Act (2013), the National Defense Authorization Act (2014), co-sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act (2014) and led the successful push to pass the First Step Act (2018). In 2017, he became the first sitting senator to testify against another when he testified against Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions. He was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2020 United States presidential election.\n\nBooker was born on April 27, 1969, in Washington, D.C.; he grew up in Harrington Park, New Jersey, north of Newark. His parents, Carolyn Rose (née Jordan) and Cary Alfred Booker, were among the first black executives at IBM. Booker has stated that he was raised in a religious household and that he and his family attended a small African Methodist Episcopal Church in New Jersey. Booker has Sierra Leonean ancestry, a fact which was presented to him on the PBS television program, Finding Your Roots.\n\nBooker graduated from Northern Valley Regional High School at Old Tappan, where he played varsity football and was named to the 1986 USA Today All-USA high school football team. Booker went on to Stanford University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1991 and a Master of Arts in sociology the following year. While at Stanford, he played football as a tight end and was teammates with Brad Muster and Ed McCaffrey, and also made the All–Pacific-10 Academic team and was elected senior class president. In addition, Booker ran The Bridge Peer Counseling Center, a student-run crisis hotline, and organized help from Stanford students for youth in East Palo Alto, California.\n\nAfter Stanford, Booker was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University, where he earned an honors degree in United States history in 1994 as a member of The Queen's College. He earned his Juris Doctor in 1997 from Yale Law School, where he operated free legal clinics for low-income residents of New Haven, Connecticut. At Yale, Booker was a founding member of the Chai Society (now Shabtai), was a Big Brother with Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, and was active in the National Black Law Students Association.\n\nContemplating advocacy work and a run for city council in Newark after graduating from law school, Booker lived in the city during his final year at Yale. After graduation, he served as staff attorney for the Urban Justice Center in New York and program coordinator of the Newark Youth Project. In 1998, Booker won an upset victory for a seat on the Municipal Council of Newark, defeating four-term incumbent George Branch. To draw attention to the problems of open-air drug dealing and associated violence, he went on a 10-day hunger strike and lived in a tent and later in a motor home near drug-dealing areas of the city. Booker also proposed council initiatives that impacted housing, young people, law and order, and the efficiency and transparency of city hall, but was regularly outvoted by all of his fellow councilors.\n\nOn January 9, 2002, Booker announced his campaign for Mayor of Newark, rather than running for re-election as councilman; this pitted him against longtime incumbent Sharpe James. James, who had easily won election four consecutive times, saw Booker as a real threat, and responded with mudslinging, at one campaign event calling him \"a Republican who took money from the KKK [and] Taliban ... [who's] collaborating with the Jews to take over Newark\". In the campaign, James' supporters questioned Booker's suburban background, calling him a carpetbagger who was \"not black enough\" to understand the city. Booker lost the election on May 14, garnering 47% of the vote to James' 53%. The election was chronicled in the Oscar-nominated documentary \"Street Fight\".\n\nDuring the campaign, Booker founded the nonprofit organization Newark Now.\n\nBooker announced on February 11, 2006, that he would again run for mayor. Although incumbent Mayor Sharpe James filed paperwork to run for reelection, shortly thereafter he announced that he would instead cancel his bid to focus on his work as a State Senator, which he was originally elected to in 1999. At James's discretion, Deputy Mayor Ronald Rice decided to run as well. Booker's campaign outspent Rice's 25 to 1, for which Rice attacked him. In addition to raising over $6 million for the race, Booker attacked Rice as a \"political crony\" of James. Booker won the May 9 election with 72% of the vote. His slate of city council candidates, known as the \"Booker Team\", swept the council elections, giving Booker firm leadership of the city government.\n\nOn April 3, 2010, Booker announced his campaign for reelection. At his announcement event, he remarked that a \"united government\" was crucial to progress, knowing his supporters in the city council faced tough reelections. Heavily favored to win, Booker faced former judge and Essex County prosecutor Clifford J. Minor, as well as two minor candidates. On May 11, Booker won reelection with 59% of the vote.\n\nBefore taking office as mayor, Booker sued the James administration, seeking to terminate cut-rate land deals favoring two redevelopment agencies that had contributed to James's campaigns and listed James as a member of their advisory boards. Booker argued that the state's \"pay-to-play\" laws had been violated and that the land deals would cost the city more than $15 million in lost revenue. Specifically, Booker referenced a parcel at Broad and South Streets that would generate only $87,000 under the proposed land deals yet was valued at $3.7 million under then-current market rates. On June 20, 2006, Superior Court Judge Patricia Costello ruled in favor of Booker.\n\nIn late June 2006, before Booker took office, New Jersey investigators foiled a plot to assassinate Booker led by Bloods gang leaders inside four New Jersey state prisons. The motive for the plot was unclear, but was described variously as a response to the acrimonious campaign and to Booker's campaign promises to take a harder line on crime.\n\nBooker assumed office as Mayor of Newark on July 1, 2006. After his first week in office, he announced a 100-day plan to implement reforms in Newark. The proposed changes included increasing police forces, ending background checks for many city jobs to help former offenders find employment in the city, refurbishing police stations, improving city services, and expanding summer youth programs.\n\nOne of Booker's first priorities was to reduce the city's crime rate. In furtherance of this, he appointed Garry McCarthy, former deputy commissioner of operations of the New York City Police Department, as director of the Newark Police Department. Crime reduction was such a central concern to the Booker administration that Booker, along with his security team, was known to personally patrol the streets of Newark until as late as 4 a.m.\n\nBooker was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, a bipartisan group with a stated goal of \"making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets\". Booker was honored in October 2009 by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence with the Sarah Brady Visionary Award for his work in reducing gun violence. During his mayoralty, crime dropped significantly in Newark, which led the nation in violent crime reduction from 2006 to 2008. March 2010 marked Newark's first murder-free month in over 44 years, although murder and overall crime rates began to rise again after 2008. In addition to his crime-lowering initiatives, Booker doubled the amount of affordable housing under development and quadrupled the amount under pre-development, and reduced the city budget deficit from $180 million to $73 million.\n\nAfter taking office, Booker voluntarily reduced his own salary twice, reducing his salary by 8% early in his first year as mayor. He also raised the salaries of many city workers. However, his administration imposed one-day-a-month furloughs for all non-uniformed employees from July through December 2010, as well as 2% pay cuts for managers and directors earning more than $100,000 a year. In 2008 and 2009, the City of Newark received the Government Finance Officers Association's Distinguished Budget Presentation Award. In an effort to make government more accessible, Booker held regular open office hours during which city residents could meet with him personally to discuss their concerns. In 2010, Booker was among the finalists for the World Mayor prize, ultimately placing seventh. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 award.\n\nIn July 2010, Booker attended a dinner at a conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, where he was seated with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, who had no known ties to Newark, announced in September 2010 that he was donating $100 million of his personal fortune to the Newark school system. According to an article in \"The New York Times\", Booker and Zuckerberg continued their conversation about Booker's plans for Newark. The initial gift was made to start a foundation for education. The gift was formally announced when Booker, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and Zuckerberg appeared together on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". The timing of Zuckerberg's donation was questioned by some as a move for damage control to his image, as it was announced on the opening day of the movie \"The Social Network\", a film that painted an unflattering portrait of Zuckerberg. On her show, however, Winfrey told the audience that Zuckerberg and Booker had been in talks for months and had actually planned the announcement for the previous month, and that she and Booker had to force Zuckerberg to put his name to the donation, which he had wanted to make anonymously.\n\nOn October 10, 2010, Booker established Let's Move! Newark as part of First Lady Michelle Obama's national Let's Move! initiative against childhood obesity.\n\nBooker gained national attention when, on December 28, 2010, a constituent used Twitter to ask him to send someone to her father's house to shovel his driveway, because her elderly father was going to attempt to do it himself. Booker responded by tweeting, \"I will do it myself; where does he live?\" Other people volunteered, including one person who offered his help on Twitter, and 20 minutes later Booker and some volunteers showed up and shoveled the man's driveway.\n\nIn October 2011, Booker expanded the Let's Move! Newark program to include Let's Move! Newark: Our Power, a four-month fitness challenge for Newark public school students run by public health advocate Jeff Halevy.\n\nOn April 12, 2012, Booker saved a woman from a house fire, suffering smoke inhalation and second-degree burns on his hands in the process. Newark Fire Chief John Centanni said that Booker's actions possibly saved the woman's life. After Hurricane Sandy destroyed much of the shoreline areas of New Jersey and New York in late October 2012, Booker invited Newarkers without power to eat and sleep in his home. In February 2013, responding to a Twitter post, Booker helped a nervous constituent propose to his girlfriend. Booker rescued a dog from freezing temperatures in January 2013 and another dog that had been abandoned in a cage in July 2013.\n\nOn November 20, 2012, a melee occurred at a Newark City Council meeting attended by Booker. The nine-seat council was to vote on the successor to the seat vacated by newly elected U.S. Representative Donald M. Payne, Jr. Booker's opponents on the council, including Ras Baraka, sought to appoint John Sharpe James, son of the former mayor, while Booker and his supporters favored Shanique Speight. Booker attended the meeting to deal with the eventuality of the lack of a quorum or a tie vote, in which state law would allow him to cast a deciding vote. After Baraka was refused an opportunity to address the council by acting Council President Anibal Ramos, Jr., Baraka and two other council members walked away in protest. Booker cast the deciding vote for Speight. Supporters of James stormed the stage and were held back by riot police, who eventually used pepper spray on some members of the crowd. Baraka later blamed Booker for inciting the disturbance, while Booker refused comment to the media after the vote.\n\nIn December 2012, after discussions with a constituent about New Jersey's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Booker began a week-long challenge attempting to live on a food budget of $30 per week—the amount SNAP recipients receive. When critics noted that the very name of the SNAP program shows that it is intended to \"supplement\" an individual's food budget, not be its sole source, Booker replied that his aim was to spark a discussion about the reality that many Americans rely solely on food stamps to survive.\n\nThe Newark Watershed comprises 35,000 acres of pristine land and reservoirs that supply water to municipalities in northern New Jersey. A New Jersey State Comptroller report issued in February 2014 revealed irregularities and corruption within the Newark Watershed and Development Corporation, which was in the process of being dismantled after being taken over by the city during Booker's mayoralty.\n\nThroughout Booker's mayoralty, Fairleigh Dickinson University's public opinion poll PublicMind asked New Jersey residents statewide whether or not they had heard of Mayor Booker and whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of him. The results are as follows:\nSeptember 2008\n\nApril 2009\n\nMay 2010\n\nMay 2012\n\nJanuary 2013\n\nMarch 2014\n\nBooker's mayoralty and celebrity drew much media attention to Newark. While he enjoyed high ratings from city residents, his legacy has received mixed reviews. During his tenure, millions of dollars were invested in downtown development, but underemployment and high murder rates continue to characterize many of the city's neighborhoods. Despite legal challenges initiated during his term, Newark Public Schools has remained under control of the state for nearly twenty years. Newark received $32 million in emergency state aid in 2011 and 2012, requiring a memorandum of understanding between Newark and the state that obligated the city to request and the state to approve appointments to city hall administrative positions.\n\nWhile Mayor of Newark, Booker claimed in an interview that Newark's unemployment rate had fallen by two percentage points. This statement was rated \"false\" by PolitiFact, because he used data that had not been seasonally adjusted; the adjusted rate was 0.7 percentage points.\n\nOn December 20, 2012, Booker announced that he would explore running for the U.S. Senate seat that was then occupied by Frank Lautenberg in the 2014 election, ending speculation that he would challenge Governor Chris Christie in the 2013 gubernatorial election. On January 11, 2013, Booker filed papers to form a campaign committee, without announcing whether he would run. Roughly one month later, incumbent Lautenberg—then 89 years of age—announced that he would not seek reelection in 2014.\n\nOn June 3, Lautenberg died of viral pneumonia; five days later, Booker announced his intention to run for Lautenberg's seat in a 2013 special election. Booker announced his candidacy at two events: one in Newark and the other in Willingboro.\n\nOn August 13, 2013, Booker was declared the winner of the Democratic primary, with approximately 59% of the vote. On October 16, 2013, he defeated Republican Steve Lonegan in the general election, 54.9% to 44.0%. Booker was the first African-American to be elected to the Senate since Barack Obama in 2004. The night before his victory, Booker visited the gravesite of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, where he offered his prayers and lit a vigil candle in memory of his father.\n\nBooker resigned as Mayor of Newark on October 30, 2013 and was sworn in on October 31, 2013 as the junior U.S. Senator from New Jersey. He is the first African-American U.S. Senator from New Jersey.\n\nOn January 9, 2014, Brian D. Goldberg, a West Orange resident and New Jersey businessman, announced that he would seek the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. On January 27, 2014, Freehold Township businessman Richard J. \"Rich\" Pezzullo announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination. Pezzullo had previously run for the US Senate in 1996 as the Conservative Party candidate. On February 4, 2014, conservative political consultant Jeff Bell announced his bid for the nomination. Bell was the Republican Party nominee for U.S. Senate in 1978. Ramapo College professor Murray Sabrin, who ran for the Senate in 2000 and 2008, announced another run on February 13.\n\nBell won the Republican primary and received support from the conservative American Principles Fund, which ran a direct mail operation costing over $80,000, and the National Organization for Marriage, an organization opposed to same-sex marriage, which paid for $6,000 of automated calling. Booker defeated Bell in the general election, capturing 55.8% of the vote to Bell's 42.4%.\n\nOn October 31, 2013, Booker was sworn into the Senate. In November 2013, Booker co-sponsored and voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. In December 2013, he was one of the original cosponsors of Bob Menéndez's Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013, which would toughen sanctions against Iran. He also voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. In January 2014, he cosponsored the Respect for Marriage Act. In February 2014, Booker voted against the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013. In March, Booker pledged to meet with each of his Republican colleagues in the Senate in order to find common ground, and was spotted having dinner with Senator Ted Cruz in Washington.\n\nLeading up to the 2016 presidential election, Booker endorsed Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. He was speculated as a potential vice presidential candidate during the primary and as the general election began, though Booker stated on June 16, 2016, that he was not being vetted. After the election, in which Donald Trump defeated Clinton, on January 11, 2017, Booker testified against Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions, the first instance of a sitting senator testifying against another during a cabinet position confirmation hearing.\n\nBooker was supportive of fellow New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez while Menendez faced trial on federal corruption and bribery charges. During the trial, Booker was a character witness for Menendez, giving him effusive praise. After the judge declared a mistrial, Booker argued that prosecutors ought not to take Menendez to trial again. When Menendez ran for re-election, Booker praised Menendez, saying he was \"so grateful for Bob Menendez and that I get to work with him and stand beside him\". Booker downplayed the corruption allegations, saying \"to try to continue to try to throw this kind of mud at him, it's not going to stick. It didn't stick when the government tried to do it and it should not stick now.\"\n\nCory Booker was named as part of the \"Hell-No Caucus\" by \"Politico\" in 2018, along with Senators Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, given he voted \"overwhelmingly to thwart his [Trump's] nominees for administration jobs\", such as with Rex Tillerson, Betsy De Vos, and Mike Pompeo; all of the Senators were considered potential 2020 presidential contenders at this point in time.\n\nIn April 2018, following the FBI raid on the hotel room and offices of Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, Booker, together with Chris Coons, Lindsey Graham, and Thom Tillis, introduced new legislation to \"limit President Trump's ability to fire special counsel Robert Mueller\". Termed the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, the legislation would allow any special counsel, in this case Mueller, to receive an \"expedited judicial review\" in the 10 days following being dismissed to determine if said dismissal was suitable. If negative, the special counsel would be reinstated. At the same time, according to \"The Hill\", the bill would \"codify regulations\" that a special counsel could be fired by only a senior Justice Department official, while having to provide reasons in writing.\n\nOn September 5, 2018, during the Senate Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated by Trump to replace retiring Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, Booker questioned Kavanaugh on a series of E-mails marked \"committee confidential\", dating back to Kavanaugh's time in the office of the White House Counsel during the presidency of George W. Bush. The E-mails, which were released to the public by Booker's office the following day, show Kavanaugh and others in the Counsel's office discussing racial profiling as a means to combat terrorism, particularly after 9/11. Booker said that he was violating Senate rules in releasing the documents, with the penalty including possible expulsion from the Senate; he nonetheless defended his decision, referring to the process of producing documents for the hearing as a \"sham\" and challenging those who warned him about the consequences to \"bring it on\". Booker also described the release as \"probably the closest I'll ever have in my life to an 'I am Spartacus' moment\", referring to a line in the 1960 film, \"Spartacus\". But committee chairman Chuck Grassley said the documents had already been cleared for public release the night before, and that Booker was not violating any rules, leading some Republicans to accuse Booker of engaging in \"theatrics\" and \"histrionics\". Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas mocked Booker in comments the following week, saying, \"Honorable – if we could use that word about more people who are in public life, people who actually ask the questions at confirmation hearings, instead of 'Spartacus.'\"\n\nIn November 2018, Booker co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.270), which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.\n\nBooker played a leading role in the push to pass the First Step Act, a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill. Booker has introduced the Marijuana Justice Act which would legalize cannabis in the United States on the federal level, defund some law enforcement in jurisdictions that have shown racial bias in marijuana arrests, and increase funding to communities affected by the war on drugs.\n\nBooker announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2020 election on February 1, 2019.\n\n\n\nOn February 1, 2019, Booker announced his campaign for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2020 presidential election, the start of Black History Month. Before his announcement, he was widely speculated to run for president but expressed uncertainty as to whether he would run. The same month Booker announced his campaign, Governor Phil Murphy U.S. Senator Bob Menendez and every Democratic member of the House of Representatives from New Jersey endorsed Booker. Booker held a campaign kick off rally in Newark on April 13. After qualifying for the first five Democratic Party presidential debates, Booker failed to meet the polling thresholds to participate in the sixth debate that was held in December 2019. On January 13, Booker announced that he was ending his run at the Democratic nomination for president. In March 2020, Booker endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden, over Senator Bernie Sanders, for president.\n\nBooker has been described as a liberal. Throughout his Senate career, Booker has amassed a liberal voting record. In a July 2013 \"Salon\" interview, Booker said that \"there's nothing in that realm of progressive politics where you won't find me.\" In a September 2013 interview with \"The Grio\", when asked if he considered himself a progressive, he stated that he is a Democrat and an American. Booker has the most pro-animal welfare voting record in the Senate year after year according to the Humane Society.\n\nHe supports long-term deficit reduction efforts to ensure economic prosperity, cap and trade taxation to combat climate change, and increased funding for education. He has spoken in favor of creating a federal jobs guarantee and baby bonds (low-risk savings accounts that minors get access to at age 18). In the Senate, he has emphasized issues of racial and social justice. He played a leading role in the push to pass the First Step Act, a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill. He supports ending the War on Drugs. Booker supports abortion rights and affirmative action.<ref name=\"Cory Booker/Steve Lonegan\">Matt Friedman, \"Where Cory Booker and Steve Lonegan stand on the issues\", \"nj\", October 16, 2013</ref> He also supports a single-payer health care plan: in September 2017, he joined Bernie Sanders and 14 other co-sponsors in submitting a single-payer health care plan to congress called the \"Medicare for All\" bill.\n\nOn foreign policy, Booker supports scaling down U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and is against intervention in Syria. After the US strike on Syria in April 2017, he criticized military action \"without a clear plan\" or authorization from Congress. He supports a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. On Iran, Booker has stated the country poses a direct threat to American and Israeli security and feels all options should be on the table for dealing with the conflict. However, his decision to back the Iran nuclear deal framework damaged his long-term relationship with some Jewish voters and supporters. In an attempt to reduce the damage, he initiated an emergency summit for Jewish leaders, which some of his longstanding supporters did not attend.\n\nIn 2009, after Barack Obama became President of the United States, Booker was offered the leadership of the new White House Office of Urban Affairs. He turned the offer down, citing a commitment to Newark.\n\nBooker generated controversy on May 12, 2012, when he appeared on \"Meet The Press\" as a surrogate for the reelection campaign of Barack Obama and made remarks that were critical of that campaign. Booker said that the attacks on Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's record at Bain Capital were \"nauseating to me on both sides. It's nauseating to the American public. Enough is enough. Stop attacking private equity. Stop attacking Jeremiah Wright.\" The comments were subsequently used by the Romney campaign against Obama. Booker made follow-up comments clarifying that he believed Obama's attacks on Romney's record at Bain were legitimate but did not retract his point about attacking private equity in general. Two weeks later, Booker's communications director Anne Torres tendered her resignation, although she maintained it was unrelated to \"Meet the Press\".\n\nBooker sits on the board of advisers of the political action committee Democrats for Education Reform. He is currently a member of the board of trustees at Teachers College, Columbia University, and was formerly a member of the Executive Committee at Yale Law School and the Board of Trustees at Stanford University.\n\nIn 2010, Booker received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by the Jefferson Awards.\n\nIn May 2009, Booker received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the Newark-based New Jersey Institute of Technology for \"his outstanding career in public service as the Mayor of Newark\". In May 2009, he received an honorary doctorate from Brandeis University, and was a commencement speaker that year as well. Booker received another honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in December 2010 from Yeshiva University for \"his bold vision for Newark and setting a national standard for urban transformation\". In June 2011, Booker received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and served as that year's commencement speaker at Williams College for the urban transformation of Newark. In May 2012, Booker received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Bard College and gave the commencement speech at the graduation. In 2010, Booker delivered the commencement addresses at Pitzer College in Claremont, California, on May 15; Columbia University's Teachers College in New York City on May 17; and Suffolk University Law School in Boston, Massachusetts, a week later on May 23, 2010. Booker gave the commencement address to New York Law School graduates on May 13, 2011, at Avery Fisher Hall (now David Geffen Hall) at Lincoln Center. Booker gave the commencement address at the University of Rhode Island in May 2011; he also received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree. He delivered a commencement address to Stanford University graduates on June 17, 2012, at Stanford Stadium. He also received an honorary degree at Fairleigh Dickinson's 69th Commencement Ceremony in May 2012.\n\nIn May 2013, Booker gave the commencement address at Washington University in St. Louis and received an honorary doctorate of law.\n\nOn May 16, 2014, Booker gave the commencement speech for Ramapo College of New Jersey graduates at the IZOD Center.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, when Clinton had an illness described as \"pneumonia\", Donna Brazile, the then DNC interim chair, considered that her ideal replacement ticket would consist of Joe Biden and Cory Booker. However, the possibility of a divisive reaction and the possibility of \"allowing Trump to capture votes in confusion\" caused her to \"not entertain any more thoughts of replacing Hillary\".\n\nBooker's 2002 mayoral campaign, which he lost, was chronicled by filmmaker Marshall Curry in his documentary \"Street Fight\". The film was nominated in 2005 for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.\n\nSince 2009, Booker has starred in the documentary series \"Brick City\". The series focuses on Booker and his efforts to improve Newark by reducing crime and bringing about economic renewal. \"Brick City\" won a Peabody Award in 2009 and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy in 2010.\n\nBooker contributed to the 2011 documentary \"Miss Representation\" and commented on the representations of women in politics within mass media.\n\nBooker appeared in a scene in the 2015 \"Parks and Recreation\" episode \"Ms. Ludgate-Dwyer Goes to Washington\" alongside Orrin Hatch.\n\nIn the fall of 2009, \"Tonight Show\" host Conan O'Brien engaged in a satirical on-air and YouTube feud with Booker, with O'Brien jokingly insulting the City of Newark and Booker responding that he would ban O'Brien from the Newark airport. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for the feud to end during a prepared comedy skit, telling Booker to chalk it up to a head injury suffered by O'Brien less than two weeks earlier. Booker then appeared on O'Brien's show and assured viewers that the feud was over and that he was actually a big fan of O'Brien, who agreed that every time he made a joke about Newark, he would donate $500 to the City of Newark, and also made a $50,000 donation to the Newark Now charity, which was matched by NBC Universal.\n\nIn 2012, Booker and tech executives Sarah Ross and Nathan Richardson formed Waywire, a company focused on video sharing technology. Early investors included Oprah Winfrey, Eric Schmidt, Jeff Weiner, and Troy Carter. After Booker's relationship to Waywire was discussed in a front-page \"The New York Times\" story, board member Andrew Zucker stepped down from his position. Shortly thereafter, Waywire CEO Nathan Richardson departed the business as the company shifted its focus from content creation to content curation. In August 2013, Booker told NBC News he intended to resign from the Waywire board and put his holdings in a trust if elected to the Senate; by September, he had resigned his place on the board and donated his share of the company to charity. Waywire was sold to another video curation business the following month.\n\nIn 2016, Booker wrote an autobiography, \"United: Thoughts on Finding Common Ground and Advancing the Common Good\".\n\nIn an article in \"HuffPost\", Shmuly Yanklowitz said of the book:\n\nBooker regularly exercises and has been a vegetarian since 1992, when he was a student at Oxford University in the UK. He abstains from alcohol and \"has no known vices or addictions\" other than coffee. In 2014, Booker began practicing a vegan diet and has expressed his vegan ethical philosophy and advocacy for animals. As of June 2016, Booker worshiped at the Metropolitan Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nBooker has never been married, and in 2013 he was named one of \"Town & Country\"s \"Top 40 Bachelors\". Although he has generally tried to keep his personal life private, Booker has in the past described himself as a \"straight male\" and has said that he is trying to date more in hopes of finding someone to settle down with. He has been romantically linked to poet Cleo Wade. In March 2019, actress Rosario Dawson confirmed to TMZ that she was in a relationship with Booker.\n\nIn a 1992 column in \"The Stanford Daily\", Booker admitted that as a teenager he had \"hated gays\". Booker has himself been the target of rumors about being gay and has generally refused to address these on principle, which he explained in 2013:\n\nBecause I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I'm gay, and I say, \"So what does it matter if I am? So be it. I hope you are not voting for me because you are making the presumption that I'm straight.\"\n\nIn 1992, Booker recounted in his column for \"The Stanford Daily\" that as a 15-year-old kissing a friend on New Year's Eve, he reached for her breast, had his hand pushed away once, and then \"reached [his] 'mark.'\" The column described Booker's changed attitudes towards sexual relations and how \"skewed attitudes\" lead to rape. \"The Daily Caller\" and Fox News brought up the column during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings in September 2018.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2006, Booker lived in Brick Towers, a troubled housing complex in Newark's Central Ward. In November 2006, as one of the last remaining tenants in Brick Towers, Booker left his apartment for the top unit in a three-story rental on Hawthorne Avenue in Newark's South Ward, an area described as \"a drug- and gang-plagued neighborhood of boarded-up houses and empty lots\". Brick Towers has since been demolished, and a new mixed-income development was built there in 2010.\n\nSince 2013, Booker has lived in a townhouse he owns in the Lincoln Park section of Newark's Central Ward, also known as \"the Coast\" for its arts, jazz, and nightlife history.\n\nBooker speaks Spanish; he attended a Spanish immersion program in Ecuador.\n\n"}

{"id": "2130134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2130134", "title": "Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935", "text": "Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935\n\nThe Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA), also known as the Wheeler-Rayburn Act, was a US federal law giving the Securities and Exchange Commission authority to regulate, license, and break up electric utility holding companies. It limited holding company operations to a single state, thus subjecting them to effective state regulation. It also broke up any holding companies with more than two tiers, forcing divestitures so that each became a single integrated system serving a limited geographic area. Another purpose of the PUHCA was to keep utility holding companies engaged in regulated businesses from also engaging in unregulated businesses. The act was based on the conclusions and recommendations of the 1928-35 Federal Trade Commission investigation of the electric industry. On March 12, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt released a report he commissioned by . This report became the template for the PUHCA. The political battle over its passage was one of the bitterest of the New Deal, and was followed by eleven years of legal appeals by holding companies led by the Electric Bond and Share Company, which finally completed its breakup in 1961.\n\nOn August 26, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the bill into law.\n\nThe Energy Policy Act of 2005 repealed the PUHCA.\n\nThe passage of the Public Utilities Holding Company Act was the climax to the thirty-year nationwide fight between public vs. private development of electricity in the United States. Other societal issues like the postal service, public roads, schools, social security, national health insurance, and public ownership of electric generation were part of a global phenomenon with most of Europe and regions of the United States in support of mixed economies. The National Electric Light Association and its member companies organized the largest U.S. Public Relations campaign of the 1920s. The campaign had two goals: to stigmatize public ownership on the one hand while promoting the rapid consolidation of the private sector into a few giant multi-tiered holding companies. The nearly 2,000 cities that had public systems, led by Nebraska Senator George W. Norris, Montana Senator Thomas J. Walsh and Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot were able to pass the 1928 Senate Resolution 83 which directed the Federal Trade Commission to conduct a detailed investigation of the industry's finances and propaganda war waged against publicly owned utilities. That Seven-year investigation took on special meaning following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 as the early phase of the investigation showed large scale corruption hidden within the six to ten layered pyramid holding company structures that concentrated financial power in the hands of a few.\n\nIn June 1932, the Middle West Utility empire, one of the largest electric holding companies operating in 39 U.S. states went bankrupt, destroying the life savings of hundreds of thousands of small investors across the east and mid-west. New York Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was a public power supporter campaigned on the issue of reforming the electric industry and won election as the country's 32nd president. His initial years in office included large public works projects such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, Bonneville Power Administration and California's Central Valley Project. These were all massive, federally funded water and power projects that put tens of thousands of people to work. The most important of these projects was the Rural Electrification Administration that finally brought electricity to rural America which was shunned by the country's urban-based electric industry as there was no profit to be made.\n\nAs the Federal Trade Commission's seven-year investigation was starting to wind up, Roosevelt formed the National Power Policy Committee (NPPC) to make sense of the investigation and its recommendations. The PUHCA was originally requested by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in his Second State of the Union Address and was based on the work done by the NPPC. The Committee was made up of federal agencies, led by Robert E. Healy who oversaw the 1928-35 Federal Trade Commission's 63,000-page electric investigation. On February 6, 1935 the Wheeler-Rayburn bill was introduced by Senator Wheeler (S 1725) and Representative Rayburn (HR 5423). It was one of several New Deal trust-busting and securities regulation initiatives that were enacted following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression. By 1932, eight of the largest utility holding companies controlled 73 percent of the investor-owned electric industry. Their complex, highly leveraged, corporate structures were very difficult for individual states to regulate.\n\nThe New Deal's agenda would face its biggest legislative fight over the passage of the PUHCA. Since March 1928, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was releasing monthly reports to the U.S. Senate on its investigation of the electric industry. On November 15, 1934, the FTC released segment 71A of its 94 volume investigation that summarized the decades-old \"propaganda\" war against the general public and supporters of municipal ownership of electric facilities. There was little coverage of the FTC's ongoing public hearings or monthly reports by the country's conservative news media, but this would soon change.\n\nOn November 20, 1934 the Associated Press released a detailed story about President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's (FDR) National Power Policy Committee (NPPC). The President setup the NPPC on July 29, 1934 to review and report on the FTC's massive electric industry investigation. FDR picked Securities and Exchange Commissioner and former judge Robert E. Healy, who had also been in charge of the FTC's electric investigation, to lead the NPPC review. The article disclosed all of the administration's legislative plan two months before the NPPC or the FTC released their reports or recommendations on the electric industry.\n\nOn January 4, 1935 FDR announced his plan to regulate the electric industry in his Second State of the Union Address. The FTC's investigation was still a year from being completed, with ongoing financial studies and work on the natural gas industry still incomplete. Yet, on January 25, three days before the FTC released segment 73A of the 94 volume investigation to the U.S. Senate, covering its financial recommendations on electric holding companies, the massive Associated Gas & Electric (AG&E) holding company placed its first large attack advertisement in major newspapers. The FTC's January 28 two-hundred page report called for the elimination of \"evil practices and conditions\" in the industry that its investigation had uncovered. In its November 1934 summary, the FTC documented the \"propaganda\" war waged against the public power movement dating back at least to 1919. In fact, the industry's own annual proceedings clearly document that its anti-public power campaign had been active since the 1890s. In 1906, the National Electric Light Association's \"co-operation\" campaign was established in part, to monitor and counter the nationwide public ownership movement.\n\nAn integral part of the industry's co-operation campaign was its friendly PR strategy with the nation's press. The result was that the FTC's investigation didn't appear to be newsworthy. The FTC exposed the industry's nationwide propaganda campaign (the industry's own words) to censor any negative coverage or history related to its activities, including the manipulation of the nation's textbook and radio industries. For example, MH Aylesworth who was the first president of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) was also the executive director of the National Electric Light Association from 1921–26. It was General Electric who founded the Radio Corporation of America that purchased the country's first radio network from AT&T that became NBC in 1926. The FTC investigation produced thousands of pages of testimony on how the country's electric industry successfully enlisted the support of the press across the country with its strategy of dangling advertising dollars while submitting vast quantities of anonymous materials to it for publication. The country's mostly conservative press had become allies with the industry in its goal to stigmatize the municipal ownership community as un-American. Going back to the 1907-13 period when the entire country shifted from municipal to state regulation of the electric industry with the creation of state agencies known as Public utilities commissions, this shift that favored private companies should have been framed as a regressive shift in favor of the \"power trust\" as big electric companies were commonly referred to or \"city vs. state\" power politics. But this is not how the conservative press framed the struggle or what its advertising client the electric industry wanted. The shift from municipal to state regulatory oversight also represents one of the largest examples of Regulatory capture known as the complexity of the electricity industry combined with the model laws passed between 1907-13 resulted in commissions made up almost entirely of former industry professionals. This bias became evident when 46 of the 48 state commissions openly sided with the electric industry during public hearings on the Wheeler-Rayburn Bill.\n\nIn other words, the investigation documented that the electric industry had set up a personal relationship with the owners and editorial boards of the news industry and as a result were being given tens of thousands of free editorial pieces monthly. In many cases, the industry's own press services were distributing content that the local and national newspapers then reprinted without acknowledging the source. This same relationship with the press would then be used to frame the battle to stop the Wheeler-Rayburn bill by terrifying the country's small investors with their \"death sentence\" clause meme that the press repeated from then on.\n\nOn February 6, 1935, 9 days after the Federal Trade Commission released its conclusions and recommendations from its six-year probe, Senator Wheeler (SB 1725) and Rep. Rayburn (HR 5423) introduced legislation that became one of the bitterest legislative fights in history.\n\nSenator Wheeler's version of the legislation was submitted to the Senate's Interstate Commerce Committee, where public hearings were held and amendments to it were voted on and passed by a vote of 14–2 on May 13. The bill passed the full senate by a vote of 56 to 32 on June 11. However, Representative Rayburn faced a full-scale war. Representatives were being blasted by millions of letters and hundreds of thousands of telegrams demanding the defeat of the legislation, while the industry lined up allies that produced many expert witnesses during hearings. At the same time, an army of unregistered lobbyists stormed the doors of representatives as the country's print media was bombarded with major ads and editorials opposing the legislation.\n\nOn July 2, newspaper headlines across the country blared that FDR and his \"Death Clause\" had lost as the House of Representatives pulled the dreaded section 2 of the house bill. The campaign rhetoric against the law became so extreme that lobbyists were even claiming that FDR was planning on taking over the industry. Even bringing in opposition to the bill from the country's public utility commissioners. But there was a slip-up. Why did just a couple of towns in the country show up as the source for almost all of the telegrams sent to congress? The same day that the clause was pulled, the senate organized a new committee to look into the lobbying. Alabama Senator Hugo Black was placed in charge of the investigating committee while the house also opened a special committee that was led by an industry supporter who used their time attacking the president.\n\nThe Black committee quickly got to the bottom of what was a fake nationwide campaign orchestrated by the electric industry to make it look like there was real public opposition to the legislation. On August 8, Senator Black went on nationwide radio prime time to describe the $5 million (that's $93 million today) war mounted against the legislation. He also pointed the finger at the head of AG&E, Howard C. Hopson who the committee had subpoenaed but had yet to be found who the near bankrupt company had spent over $700,000 opposing the legislation. AG&E had been found to be behind fake telegrams estimated to have reach 250,000 in number that had been wrongfully impersonating citizens that had no knowledge that their names had been attached to telegrams. Hearings documented the destruction of electric companies data in a desperate attempt to cover up the fake movement's millions of letters and telegrams - where even the Western Union offices that had launched the tens of thousands of telegrams accidentally had its records deleted against company policy. Western Union eventually tracked down 97,000 of the fake telegrams that had been partially burned.\n\nOther major issues from claims by senators that their phones had been wired tapped by electric companies, the FTC's report of extensive tax evasion even to bribery surfaced during the Black Committee lobbying investigation. The Black Committee's aggressive use of tactics commonly used against less powerful citizens is still used today as an historic example by conservatives of government abuse.\n\nIn even more dramatic fashion, the House investigating committee located Hopson first and then used their subpoena to protect him from the Senate investigation, while letting Hopson promote the industry side. It was later disclosed that Representative Conner's brother had been given $25,000 by the industry, and the other members of the committee were eventually able to block the chair's attempt to permanently protect Hopson by putting him under house arrest and then immediately releasing him which would of by law blocked the senate from getting him. The scandal gave the FDR and supporters of the bill the power to sway the house back into a re-vote that finally passed by a vote of 222–112 on August 24. Hopson was eventually convicted of stealing $20 million from Associated Gas & Electric ratepayers.\n\nThe so-called \"Death Sentence\" clause survived and One of the most expensive lobbying campaigns of the 20th century had failed.\n\nTalk of legal challenges were in the news the day congress passed the Wheeler-Rayburn legislation. On September 24, the Edison Electric Institute went into court challenging PUCHA's constitutionality. According to the Associated Press, on October 2 The Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint charging the National Electrical Manufacturers Association of New York and 16 member manufacturers with “unlawful combination, conspiracy and agreement to restrain competition.” The same day, another suit against PUHCA was filed in United States District Court of Maryland for trustees of the American States Public Service Co.\n\nWith the President Roosevelt signing Wheeler-Rayburn bill into law on August 26, 1935, the Securities and Exchange Commission began the process of preparing for carrying out the two main parts (Title I & II) of the law now called the Public Utilities Holding Company Act of 1935. As stated in the SEC's 1936 annual report, the agency adopted 7 new rules and 11 forms that electric companies were required to fill out when registering as all were required to do by December 31, 1935. By this June 1936, only 65 companies had registered while an additional 375 had requested exemptions.\n\nBy December 7, 1935 forty-five lawsuits on behalf of more than 100 companies had been filed in 13 different U.S. District Courts across the country. On this same day, the U.S. Attorney General and the SEC's General Counsel made a motion before the U.S. Supreme Court to stay all of the above lawsuits until the Supreme Court could determine the validity of PUHCA with the case Securities and Exchange Commission v, Electric Bond and Share Company. On November 26, 1935, the SEC, pursuant to its express authority under Section 18 of the Act, brought suit in the District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Electric Bond and Share Company and fourteen other holding companies. All other lawsuits against the SEC were dismissed except for one which was decided in favor of the SEC - in the case of Public Utility Investing Corporation. v. Utilities Power and Light Corporation. (82 F. 2d. 21, C. C. A., 4th, 1936) where the court found the act of registering did not do any irreparable damage to the company.\n\nOn March 28, 1938, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the SEC and the Public Utilities Act of 1935, giving it full authority to enforce the Act. Within 3 months 142 holding companies had registered with the SEC that made up 51 separate public utility systems, comprising 524 individual holding and 1,524 sub-holding and operating companies. An example of the dramatic impacts the law had was documented with the Columbia Gas & Electric Corporation case where the capital represented by the common stock was reduced from $194,349,005.62 to $12,304,282.00 a total of $182,044,723.62 by the elimination of the corrupting holding company structures.\n\nIn 1940, congressional investigations of brokerage firms, insurance companies and their relationship to the electric industry exposed that Middle South Utilities, the Southern Group and the Electric Bond and Share Company were all financed by Morgan Stanley, with Wall Street having financial influence over nearly 80% of the country's electric industry.\n\n\nThe Act required the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve a holding company engaging in a non-utility business and such businesses to be kept separate from the utility's regulated business. Holding companies were required to register with the SEC, which would then conduct administrative proceedings to limit each holding company to ownership of a single integrated electric system (with certain exceptions) through the divestiture of the securities of other public utility and unrelated companies.\n\nThe Act also authorized the SEC to flatten the corporate structure of utilities to remove unnecessary corporate layers. Individual operating utility companies could centralize certain business operations into central Service Companies, but all Service Companies would be subject to SEC and Federal Power Commission regulation. (In 1977, the Federal Power Commission was replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)).\n\nAs a result, when a state utility commission regulated a utility in a particular state, the rate payers of that state would pay only the share of any common service company expenses associated with that state's electric company allocated to it under SEC-approved formulas to prevent a holding company from double recovery of its expenses when it operates in more than one state.\n\nBecause the SEC strictly enforced the divestiture provision of PUHCA in its proceedings and ordered divestiture of all corporate holdings except for a single integrated electric system, the affected holding companies filed voluntary divesture plans. As a result, by 1948, holding companies had voluntarily divested themselves of assets worth approximately $12 billion and the number of subsidiaries controlled by affected holding companies was reduced from 1,983 to 303.\n\nAn important provision prohibited sales of goods or services between holding company affiliates at a profit. These rules prevented the utilities from increasing their cost-based regulated rates by artificially marking up the prices paid by the utility operating companies above what the central purchasing affiliate paid.\n\nOne noticeable impact of this provision was on electric streetcars. Most electric streetcar companies were private companies, owned by electric utility holding companies. The streetcar companies were generally unregulated while the electric utilities were regulated. By investing directly in transit firms, the electric companies were \"cash cows\" even in the Great Depression and were able to increase the basis of their limited return on investment.\n\nThe result of the provision was the divestiture of utility-owned electric streetcar companies, which were then acquired by various parties and very often dismantled replaced by buses or trackless trolleys. The largest fallout of the divestiture was the General Motors nationwide streetcar dismantlement.\n\nThrough the years, the utility industry and would-be owners of utilities lobbied Congress heavily to repeal PUHCA, claiming that it was outdated. For example, in 1989, Standley H. Hoch, CEO of General Public Utilities (GPU) had two mandates as leader: trim management and lower costs, and fight to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.\n\nOn August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law, repealing PUHCA. The repeal became effective on February 8, 2006. It was replaced by a set of laws called the \"Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005\", which gave the FERC a limited role in allocating the costs of multi-state electric utility holding companies to individual operating subsidiaries. There were consumer, environmental, union and credit rating agency objections to the new law.\n\nThe 2005 Act had many provisions that applied to just electric subsidiaries to the exclusion of natural gas subsidiaries of holding companies. On December 8, 2005, FERC recommended that Congress amend the 2005 Act to give FERC cost allocation authority over gas subsidiaries, and greater enforcement authority over gas subsidiaries, but Congress has not acted on FERC's request.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2130138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2130138", "title": "2006 Colorado gubernatorial election", "text": "2006 Colorado gubernatorial election\n\nThe Colorado gubernatorial election of 2006 was held on November 7, 2006. Incumbent Republican governor Bill Owens was unable to run due to term limits, and the election was won by Democratic nominee Bill Ritter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEx-Denver District Attorney Bill Ritter emerged as the lone Democratic candidate after his rival, Breckenridge state representative Gary Lindstrom, dropped out of the race on February 28, 2006. Several high-profile Democrats reportedly mulled a run, such as Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, State House Majority Leader Andrew Romanoff, and others, but they never announced their candidacy, leaving Ritter as the sole Democratic candidate. Nevertheless, Ritter's personal opposition to the practice of abortion initially led to much division within the ranks of his fellow Democrats, fears that were not allayed even when Ritter insisted that he had no agenda to change state law on the issue. Other Democrats pointed out that Ritter's moderate platform could be appealing to voters in a state that has in the past been considered right-leaning. In the end, the lack of any challenge to Ritter eventually led to the support and endorsement of most of the state's leading Democrats and progressive institutions.\n\nThe Republican race was from the beginning hotly contested between House Representative Bob Beauprez, and former University of Denver President Marc Holtzman. While Holtzman, who has never before held elected office, was once considered a long shot for the nomination, his message resonated with some of the Republican base. Holtzman criticized Beauprez for compromising with Democrats on key issues and for offering only belated and lukewarm opposition to Referendums C and D during the 2005 campaign. Such criticism grew strident enough for Beauprez to announce in April that he would no longer attend political debates which also included Holtzman. He is a fairly well-regarded conservative in his area of the state, but was recently a recipient of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay's ARMPAC campaign contributions. DeLay is being prosecuted on charges of money laundering and finance charges. Beauprez has been criticized by many for keeping DeLay's money after the Texas politician was indicted.\n\nThe Democrats had a strong centrist challenger that has the potential to appeal to moderates on both sides. Ritter had experience as the Denver District Attorney, from working with the Denver Public Schools, and as a humanitarian worker in Africa. Beauprez benefitted from experience in the U.S. House of Representatives in an election in which he narrowly won, and from a state that has often leaned somewhat to the right politically. However, Beauprez is a conservative Republican who alienated some independent and moderate voters with his strong stance against many social programs and criticism of funding for public education, such as his staunch opposition to Referendum C (funding for higher education and temporary reversal of Taxpayers Bill of Rights).\n\nIn the first debate of the gubernatorial election, Ritter, Beauprez and Holtzman met at a public \"town hall\" style forum in the Western Slope city of Grand Junction. In the debate, largely a political \"fire-fight\" between GOP rivals Beauprez and Holtzman, Ritter made firm stances on the controversial 2005 referendums C and D (which both rivals consistently opposed), abortion, and the environment in regards to the economy and business. On the issue of illegal immigration, Ritter and Beauprez held back while Holtzman attacked the City of Denver, Beauprez, and the Democratic Party. Ritter expressed a plea for compassion while noting the seriousness of the issue.\n\nIn the aftermath of the first debate, which was both pre-primary and non-inclusive of third party candidates, political scientists found only one consistent result: the demise of Holtzman, who later dropped out of the race. In the polls that followed, a small gap (which would slowly increase) of Ritter's lead was consistent through the summer months.\n\nIn the first post-primary debate, as well as the first to include third party candidates Dawn Winkler (Libertarian), Clyde Harkins (Constitution), and Paul Fiorino (Independent) (excluded was GOP write-in Chuck Sylvester), Ritter and Beauprez faced off in Denver.\n\nThe debate was conducted by CBS-affiliate KCNC-TV and televised live. The critical talking points of the debate were that of abortion (Beauprez's opposition, Ritter's support), the economy (Ritter's C&D backing, Beauprez's desire for repeal) and illegal immigration. Heated exchanges between Ritter and Beauprez reached a climax in their debate of Colorado's legalization of abortion, as well as the fate of Colorado's economy. In the aftermath of the first Denver debate, Ritter's polls shot up by more than seven points.\n\nIn the second debate in Denver, heated exchanges between Ritter and Beauprez on the issue of healthcare were the central focus. \"This is where contrast comes in\", Ritter said to spectators at Denver's Jewish Community Center. \"I would really say that is part of what we have to consider – what people say with how they vote when they are in Washington, D.C.\" . Released earlier, a poll by \"The Rocky Mountain News\" had put Ritter 17 points above Beauprez.\n\nIn October's first debate, Ritter had led his opponent with as much as 17 points in recent media polls and had been endorsed by both of Denver's major papers The Rocky Mountain News and The Denver Post. Aired during primetime on Denver's government access KMGH- Channel 7, the debate was repeated on cable channels through the following Monday. Immediately following the start of the debate, Ritter came under heavy fire from Beauprez on issues regarding illegal immigration and his prosecuting record. Saying that if some of the defendants involved in plea agreements with his office were in the country illegally, they were \"deportable no matter what they plead to – and they should be deported\", Beauprez retorted \"That's a bunch of spin\", saying Ritter offered the deals to help immigrant criminals stay in the country. \n\nBattling back, Ritter stated \"I think the next governor of the state ought to have something more than a cocktail-party familiarity with the criminal justice system.\" and that federal immigration officials told him they didn't have the resources to deport illegal immigrants convicted of felonies. Blaming Congress for not giving immigration authorities the funding necessary to do their job, Ritter defended his position diligently. \"I've never seen a single instance where you stood up on behalf of law enforcement ... to provide the resources to do this\", he said. \n\nBeauprez was visibly unimpressed with Ritter's rebuttal, and said he helped quickly extradite cop-killer Raul Gomez-Garcia, an illegal immigrant, by applying leverage through an amendment he offered. Countering, Ritter pointed out that Gomez-Garcia is back in Colorado only because the prosecutor agreed not to charge him with first-degree murder or seek the death penalty. \n\nThe Colorado Catholic Conference hosted the sixth debate overall, and the second business-sponsored debate. Both Ritter and Beauprez being of Roman Catholic faith, both were grilled over so-called \"morals\" issues by the religious organization. Keeping in stride with the focal points of the October campaign, major talking points were immigration and economics, which both led to charged exchanges.\n\nTelevised on KUSA across the state, the Halloween debate brought both candidates to Denver again to argue education and agriculture primarily. During the debates, both candidates received applause and audience responses from both supporters and the opposition. During one point in the debate however, while debating education, Ritter received a standing ovation from most of the crowd after his defense of controversial Referendum C&D.\n\nOn September 18, prior to a second CBS-sponsored debate in Denver, Ritter and opponent Beauprez met in the first corporate-sponsored forum held by Associated General Contractors in suburban Lakewood, Colorado. Like the later debate, the focus of the arguments leaned heavily on healthcare. However, unlike the Community Center debate, healthcare matters were argued in the business-oriented text.\n\nAfter Beauprez said he would support housing aid and heating-bill assistance, Ritter noted that Beauprez opposed Referendum C, last year's voter-approved measure to loosen revenue limits on the state for five years. That measure, which has provided hundreds of millions in extra revenues to the state this year, is helping the state restore property-tax exemptions for senior citizens and assistance with their heating bills. \"You can believe in it\", Ritter said. \"But saying you believe in it is not the same thing as supporting the methods that we have found in this state during this past legislative session to fund it.\" .\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2130195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2130195", "title": "Waldbaum's", "text": "Waldbaum's\n\nWaldbaum's was a supermarket chain with stores in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx; and in Nassau, Suffolk counties and Upstate New York. The chain also for a time operated stores in New Jersey, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Founded in 1904, Waldbaum's was one of seven \"banner store chains\" owned and operated by The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (A&P), which acquired the chain from its founding family in 1986.\n\nWaldbaum's operated full-service traditional supermarkets with varying footprints and store models and its popular marquee in certain aisles along with good food and reliable service. At its peak in the 1980s, it was the 12th largest supermarket chain in the United States and had 140 stores throughout the New York metropolitan area. All Waldbaum's stores featured fresh meats and produce. 62 stores had bakeries and 36 offered pharmacy service. As with other A&P-branded stores, Waldbaum's offered in-house products under the \"America's Choice\", \"America's Choice Kids\", \"America's Choice Gold\", \"Two-Forks Bakery\", \"Green Way\", \"Via Roma\", \"Food Basics\", \"Home Basics\", \"Great Atlantic Seafood Market\", \"Mid-Atlantic Country Farms\", \"Woodson & James\", \"Hartford Reserve\", \"Food Emporium Trading Co.\", \"Preferred Pet\" and \"Live Better\" brands.\n\nIn 1904, two brothers, Sam and Wolf Waldbaum, Jewish immigrants from the Galician region of Ukraine, opened a store in Brooklyn. Their nephew, Israel \"Izzy\" Waldbaum, came to America and joined the business. The three men ran the store, with Izzy taking over the grocery when his uncles retired. Izzy married Julia Leffel; they had three children. When Izzy died in 1948, his son Ira took over the then existing six stores in Brooklyn.\n\nThe company made history in 1938, when identical twin black brothers, Ernest and George Brown, who started working at one of the only two existing stores at the time as stockboys were promoted to checkout boys. \"It was unheard of then for a colored checker to be in a white neighborhood,\" Ernest Brown said three decades later in an interview. Both Browns later became store managers and, eventually, Waldbaum executives (vice-president and assistant vice-president, respectively).\n\nFollowing the death of his father, Ira Waldbaum left his studies at New York University to run the family business. By 1951, the company had opened its first supermarket in Flushing, Queens and net sales reached $55.2 million by 1960. In 1961, the company went public by selling shares of common stock.\n\nA&P mismanaged Waldbaum's, investing little in these stores, resulting in the closing or sale of many Foodmart stores in the New England division. A&P then converted the remaining \"Waldbaum's Foodmart\" store into the \"Super Foodmart\" banner, and later, to \"A&P Super Foodmart\" (A&P's other New England division). The remaining forty-one Waldbaum's stores existed only in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and on Long Island. Many Waldbaum's are former A&P stores.\n\nOn August 13, 2010, A&P announced that it would close twenty-five stores as the parent of Waldbaum's began the implementation and execution phase of its comprehensive turnaround; these stores closed in October 2010, including stores in Centereach and Levittown, Long Island.\n\nIn February 2011, A&P announced thirty-two additional store closings, including three Long Island Waldbaum's: Farmingdale, Smithtown, and Valley Stream on April 15, 2011. In January 2012, A&P announced half a dozen additional closings on Long Island. The grocery chain said that six stores would close in Commack, West Babylon, East Islip, Lake Ronkonkoma, Huntington Station and Rockville Centre. The closures happened in March 2012, as Waldbaum's parent company, A&P, Inc. emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nOn July 20, 2015, A&P filed for a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy, following years of financial loss and a struggle to compete with rival grocery chains. The company announced that 3 Waldbaum's stores in Carle Place, Riverhead, and Oceanside were set to close. Nineteen stores were sold to Stop & Shop and Key Food. Five store locations were purchased by Best Yet Market in November 2015, and three locations to Wakefern Food Corporation, owner of the ShopRite Food chain.\n\nAt approximately 8:15a.m. on August 2, 1978, a fire was reported at the store in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Workers who were in the store during renovations reported a fire near the compressor room. After several more calls, including a nearby pulled street box, several fire companies had been dispatched to the scene. As a result of the renovations, the fire was able to quickly spread to the mezzanine and cockloft areas. Per department policies at the time, firefighters were ordered to the roof to begin venting the building. After a determination made by the battalion chief on scene that day, a second alarm was ordered and the fire was declared as out of control. At 9:02a.m., as firefighters were on the roof with fire showing in sections, a large portion suddenly collapsed, sending twelve firefighters into the fully involved building. In the end, six firefighters had died in the fire and over 30 injured.\n\nA&P, the parent company of Waldbaum's, declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2015. All Waldbaum's stores were sold or closed by November 2015.\n\n\n"}

The name is a pun – in Bulgarian \"Nadurveni vuglishta\" means \"Horny charcoal\", but if written separately, as in \"Na durveni vuglishta\", it will still sound like the first version, but the meaning will be quite different – \"Roasted on charcoal\".\n\nThe album was initially released on audio cassettes only and after a famous controversy (see below) was released also on a CD in 2003. Some of the tracks were included in the band's CD compilation Tu'pest in 1999.\n\nPrior the album release, the lyrics of some tracks like \"Poslednoto zemno izprazvane na kosmonavta Romanenko\" (Cosmonaut Romanenko's Last Jerk-off on Earth), \"Arividerci\" and \"Vurtianalen sex\" (Virtuanal Sex) leaked to Bulgarian media and shocked part of the audience with their explicit, though humorous content.\n\nBulgarian Ministry of Culture, which by law regulates Bulgarian publishing industry, speedily [over]reacted and banned the release of the album on CD and was to file against the band in court for obscenity. Strangely, the ministry did not ban the audio cassette release of the album so it reached the market in that format.\n\nMuch to the amazement of both fans and media, the band chose not to fully exploit the marketing opportunities this controversy created and instead kept low profile. They only allowed themselves a few vague remarks on 'censorship', 'freedom of speech' and 'bigotry' during the promo party for the album in a downtown Sofia club. Bulgarian media speculated that the band and their label behaved like that due to inappropriate legal advice, which, if true, could be qualified as a major PR flop for the band.\n\nReportedly, ministry officials invited the band and representatives of their label to a meeting. No official information on the discussions held at this meeting was ever released to public but the ministry dropped its plans to sue the band.\n\nAs expected, the controversy helped the album become Hipodil's first real commercial success though no trustworthy sales figures were ever made available to public, a common practice in Bulgarian music industry even today. In 2003, the album was released on CD with no legal consequences neither for Hipodil nor for their label. The reissue had text saying \"\"Zabraneniyat album!\"\" (\"Forbidden album!\") over the Hipodil logo.\n\nMusically, the album presents Hipodil as a mature though still restless and highly critical band with strong connections to punk, ska and heavy metal. The band demonstrated significant growth in both musical and lyrical direction and even though some hardcore fans criticized the album for being a bit far from the raw sound of the band's early recordings, \"Nadurveni vuglishta\" was obviously of higher production and historical value.\n\nThe pilot track \"Bate Gojko\" (mentioned here is the Yugoslavian actor Gojko Mitić, famous in the former Eastern Bloc for his East German-made western films in which he usually played a Native American protagonist) became Hipodil's most popular song. It entered Bulgarian airplay charts, another 'first ever' in the band's history, despite the tongue-in-cheek implications in the lyrics. It was among the few Hipodil tracks to have a video.\n\nThe next song from the album to have a video was \"D'ska\", which however failed to repeat \"Bate Gojko\"'s success. These two tracks sound more mainstream and ska-orientated than the other stuff in the record, which is basically harder and more aggressive. As usual, Hipodil make a lot of funny parodies and mockeries, targeted at other Bulgarian pop acts like Argirov Brothers, Marius Kurkinski and Irina Florin and their songs in \"Tintiri-mintiri\". The band also offers some serious lyrics in songs like \"Potuvane nagore!\" (Sinking Upward), \"Otnesen!\" (Scatter-brained) and \"Vujen\" (Rope) while \"Nishto\" (Nothing) is an openly depressive song.\n\nWhen you read the first letter (B) of the English-titled song \"Bless me\" in Bulgarian (as \"V\") it sounds like the Bulgarian phrase \"Vlez mi\" (\"Enter into me\"). This phrase, as used in the chorus of the track, should not be taken literally as in Bulgarian slang it means an invitation to start a fight, another pun in the well-known style of Hipodil.\n\n\n"}

Train services are provided by Northern Trains. The current station (at the junction of the Woodhead Line and Penistone Line) opened in 1874, replacing a station solely on the Woodhead Line dating from the line's opening by the Sheffield, Ashton-Under-Lyne and Manchester Railway in 1845.\n\nThe railway station currently only serves the Penistone Line. The line connects Huddersfield with Sheffield, via Barnsley, with an hourly train in each direction. There is a voluntary organisation which supports and promotes community involvement along the line called the Penistone Line Partnership.\n\nPenistone station is the site of the one of the two remaining passing loops on the Barnsley to Huddersfield line, allowing trains coming from Sheffield and Huddersfield to pass each other. However, the sections either side of it are each single trackthat northwards to Clayton West junction and having been singled in 1969, whilst that to has been so since reopening in 1983. The loop was formerly controlled from the distinctive elevated ex-GCR Huddersfield Junction signal box south of the station until 1998, when control was transferred to the new Barnsley PSB and the box closed (it has since been demolished). Immediately north of the station, the line crosses the Don valley on an imposing 98 ft (30 m) high stone viaduct of 29 arches (one of four such structures on the route).\n\nUntil 5 January 1970, Penistone station also served passenger trains on the electrified Woodhead Line from Sheffield Victoria to Manchester Piccadilly. Electric trains started in 1954, previously the service was steam operated.\n\nThe line was entirely closed west of Penistone towards Hadfield on 17 July 1981 making Penistone station no longer a junction, but the location of the former Woodhead Line platforms is still visible. The electricity supply to the Woodhead Line was controlled from a large building adjacent to Penistone station, which is still standing (though now converted for industrial use).\n\nTrains from Huddersfield continued to use the old main line down the Don Valley to Sheffield until May 1983, when they were diverted via Barnsley over the former SYR route. This had been disused for some years but was refurbished to passenger standards in less than three months once South Yorkshire PTE agreed to continue funding the Penistone end of the route.\n\nPrior to 1959 Penistone was also the terminus of local trains from Doncaster via Barnsley and the Dearne Valley. These trains were timed to connect with Sheffield-Manchester trains at Penistone. This route was opened in 1854.\n\nThere were several railway accidents in or near Penistone in the late 19th century / early 20th century.\n\nThe station is unstaffed but has a ticket machine on the Huddersfield bound side. The main buildings (in the vee between the old Woodhead track bed and the Huddersfield line) still stand, but these are in private commercial use. Waiting rooms are provided on each platform, along with digital display screens, automated announcements and timetable poster boards to offer train running information. Level access is possible to both platforms (via a ramp from the car park), but the National Rail page for the station states that neither platform is accessible for wheelchair users due to the barrow crossing at the south end of the station (which links the platforms) having gaps in its surface.\n\nOn Monday to Saturday, trains operate every hour in each direction towards Huddersfield and via . On Sundays, these run every two hours each way.\n\nIn 2009, Alliance Rail proposed to run a 4 trains-per-day service between Huddersfield and London Kings Cross, via Worksop, Sheffield and Penistone, giving Penistone a direct train to London 4 times a day.\n\n"}

He graduated from Yale College as valedictorian in 1846, where he was a member of Skull and Bones, and studied at Yale Law School. He was a member of Connecticut Sons of the American Revolution. He married Mary Elizabeth Osborne (the daughter of Yale Law School professor and U.S. Representative Thomas Burr Osborne and Ann Sherwood.)\n\nHarrison ran for office as a Whig, and in 1854, he won a seat in the Connecticut Senate (4th District). Active in the Whig Party, and author of the Personal Liberty Bill, he was instrumental in bringing about the nullification of the Fugitive Slave Law. During the years from 1855 to 1856, he was one of the men who organized the Republican Party in Connecticut. He lost a bid for Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut in 1857, and in 1874, but he returned to the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1865, 1873, and 1883; during his last term, he was Speaker of the House.\n\nFrom 1885-1887, Harrison served as Governor of Connecticut. His contributions included initiatives on prohibition and abolition of slavery. Issues of great concern to him were education and workers' rights. He served in the Legislature at the time of the Industrial Revolution and witnessed the growing problems caused by industrialization. As Governor, he created the state Bureau of Labor Statistics, and he pushed for compulsory education to the age of 16 for Connecticut's children.\n\nHarrison died in New Haven on October 29, 1901 and is interred at Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven. Harrison gave a moving eulogy at the funeral of his cousin, also a Governor of the State of Connecticut, Roger Sherman Baldwin. Harrison said, \"It has been well said that Governor Baldwin was a great lawyer. He was an upright, a just, a conscientious and honorable man. Governor Baldwin was a true son of Connecticut. His memory deserves all honors from Connecticut, and from every one of her children.\"\n\n"}

He last played as a midfielder for the Ontario Fury in the Major Arena Soccer League.\n\nBorn in Germany to an American father and German mother, he came up through the German club system and represented Germany at the U21 and senior level. However, he was not a regular in the team. He later filed for a switch to the United States. He made his debut for them in 2010 and played at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, scoring a notable goal against Portugal.\n\nJones was born in Frankfurt and grew up in the city district of Bonames. His father is an African American former soldier for the U.S. Army who was stationed in West Germany and his mother is a white German. As a child, Jones lived in Chicago, Illinois and Greenwood, Mississippi, before his parents divorced and he returned to Germany with his mother.\n\nJones started his youth career at SV Bonames, moving to FV Bad Vilbel in 1994, at 12.\n\nIn 1995, he was recruited by Eintracht Frankfurt to play in their academy. He spent the next five years learning and building the quality of his game, and made his first appearance in the Eintracht Frankfurt II team in the 2000–01 season making 25 appearances and scoring eight goals. He made the step up to the main squad in 2001. Jones made 46 appearances for the Frankfurt senior team over two years in the 2001–2003 seasons, scoring seven goals as he was primarily played as a central defensive midfielder.\n\nHis good form at the time saw him purchased by Bayer Leverkusen. First team chances were scarce though, so he played the majority of the 2004–05 Bundesliga season for Bayer Leverkusen II.\n\nJones re-signed for Eintracht Frankfurt on loan, barely six months after signing for Bayer Leverkusen. He made fourteen appearances and scored three goals.\n\nBefore the start of the 2005–06 season, he signed a permanent deal with the Hesse based team. However, during that season, Jones suffered a serious leg injury that required surgery, and was out of the game for eight months, only returning in the first half of the last game of the season. Over the next two seasons, Jones shed his \"teen idol\" image, and established himself as a quality player and became captain of the squad.\n\nIn March 2007, Jones announced on the official Eintracht bulletin board that he would not extend his contract expiring at the end of the 2006–07 season. This enraged many Eintracht supporters, as Jones canceled a contract negotiation with chairman Heribert Bruchhagen a few days before it was scheduled to take place. In October 2006, he already had defended himself for turning down a contract offer, underlining he wanted to stay after all the management of the \"Eagles\" had done for him during his injuries. This led to him joining Schalke 04.\n\nThe following three seasons at Schalke 04 were relatively mixed for Jones, with his career being hit further by injuries including a muscular hairline crack injury which kept him out of the team for the majority of the 2009–10 season. However, he did enjoy his best stint playing regular games for the first time in his career playing 70 games in three seasons. The beginning of the 2010–11 season was again frustrating for Jones through lack of games, and after a falling out with team manager Felix Magath, he was sent to train with the reserves and made available for transfer.\n\nOn January 14, 2011, it was revealed that English Premier League team Blackburn Rovers were interested in taking Jones on loan with a view to making the signing permanent at the end of the season. With Rovers player Vince Grella's time at Rovers blighted by regular injury, the club had been looking for a defensive addition for some time, and Jones was thought to be an excellent addition to a newly developed squad under new Rovers manager Steve Kean. On January 15, Kean confirmed a deal would take place in the next week.\n\nOn January 18, 2011, it was confirmed by the club that Jones had signed on loan until the end of the season. He made his Premier League debut on January 23, 2011, starting in a 2–0 home win over West Bromwich Albion at Ewood Park and completed the full 90 minutes, receiving the man-of-the-match award on his first appearance for the club. On April 30, 2011, Jones put in another man-of-the-match display, playing the full 90 minutes in the derby game against Bolton Wanderers in a 1–0 win at Ewood Park. On May 22, 2011, against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux, he completed the full 90 minutes in the last league match of the season in a 3–2 win for Rovers. He made 15 Premier League starts for Rovers and picked up eight yellow cards in total, becoming a firm fans favorite in the process.\n\nFollowing impressive performances with Blackburn, it was thought that he would extend his stay, but the two clubs could not agree a fee and he returned to Schalke 04 in July. In 2011, Schalke 04 appointed a new manager Ralf Rangnick and the new coach announced that he would give Jones a chance to stay at the club and fight for his spot because his contract runs until 2014 and guarantees the midfielder €12 million. Following his return from Blackburn, Jones became an integral part in defensive midfield and became an ever-present in the starting XI helping Schalke 04 fight for a Champions League berth and into the quarterfinals of the Europa League against Athletic Bilbao. In the club's second leg match against FC Twente in the Round of 16 on March 15, Jones scored a goal and provided an assist for one of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's goals as Schalke 04 ran out 4–1 winners to overturn a 1–0 away defeat in the first leg.\n\nOn April 21, 2012, Jones got in a training round bust up with Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar; the two traded blows and were then sent by general manager Horst Heldt to run extra laps around the field. The following day in a match against Augsburg that finished 1–1, Jones was accused of cheating because of rolling on the ground and clutching his face following a high challenge that only nicked his hand; his play acting was then compared to Rivaldo's infamous effort against Turkey at the World Cup in 2002. The following weekend, on April 28, Jones played 85 minutes in a 4–0 defeat of Hertha Berlin which certified Schalke's position in third spot and secured automatic qualification into the group stages of next year's Champions League.\n\nJones appeared in the Bundesliga 20 times during the 2011–12 season, making his last appearance in a 3–2 win over Werder Bremen on the final day of the season, playing the full 90 minutes. Following three games in the first two weeks of October in which Jones was a second-half substitute, two Bundesliga games and one Europa League fixture, Jones started every game in which he appeared, going the full 90 in almost all of them.\n\nAfter picking up a yellow card which would rule Jones out for the return leg, he netted a well taken equalizer in Schalke 04's 1–1 draw with Galatasaray in the Champions League Round of 16 clash on February 20, 2013.\n\nOn January 30, 2014, he joined Turkish Süper Lig club Beşiktaş on a contract until the end of the season.\n\nOn August 24, 2014, Jones agreed to terms with Major League Soccer, becoming a designated player on a salary of $4.7 million for 18 months. MLS held a blind draw between the Chicago Fire and New England Revolution to decide who would receive Jones' rights. New England won the draw, making Jones the fourth designated player in club history. He scored his first career MLS goal, a game-winner, against Sporting Kansas City on September 26, 2014. Jones and the New England Revolution made it to the MLS Cup 2014 in Carson, California, but lost to the LA Galaxy 2–1 after extra time.\n\nAfter failing to agree on a new contract with New England, Jones was traded to Colorado Rapids on March 4, 2016 in exchange for a first-round selection in the 2017 MLS SuperDraft and general allocation money. On April 16, 2016 Jones made his Colorado Rapids debut and scored in a 2-1 win. Following three goals and two assists in four games, Jones was nominated for Major League Soccer's Player of the Month in April 2016.\n\nOn December 13, 2016, it was announced that LA Galaxy had acquired Jones' MLS rights in exchange for the Galaxy's first-round pick in the 2017 MLS SuperDraft and a second-round pick in the 2018 MLS SuperDraft. He was officially announced as a Galaxy player on January 18, 2017. His contract option was declined at the end of the season. Jones is reportedly looking at playing and coaching in Europe.\n\nOn July 14, 2018, Jones started and played all 90 minutes of Ventura County Fusion's USL PDL regular season finale against FC Golden State Force.\n\nJones returned to professional football on March 12, 2019, signing for the Ontario Fury of the Major Arena Soccer League. Jones joined the Fury just weeks after Landon Donovan signed with the San Diego Sockers. On February 20, 2020, Jones announced his retirement from playing professionally. \n\nHe served as head coach of the Real So Cal U19 academy team in 2018.\n\nJones broke through into the Eintracht Frankfurt squad, became a German Under-21 international and briefly became a fan favorite in Frankfurt.\nThough Jones played four matches with Germany's Under 21 team, he was often left out of the senior team, save a few friendlies with mostly reserves. In June 2009, Jones declared to the media that he would be available to play for the United States after it was clear to him that the German national team manager, Joachim Löw, did not have any plans for him in the current German set-up. Jones was eligible based on a new FIFA ruling allowing players to switch their national teams if the player had not yet played in an official FIFA match with the senior team despite having played at the youth level. Jones was eligible for the United States due to his dual German and American nationality.\n\nOn October 20, 2009, Jones was cleared by FIFA to join the United States national team. He first met with Bob Bradley and the national team during a March 2010 training camp and reportedly fit in \"really well\" according to Tim Howard. In the end, Jones did not recover from injury in time for the World Cup. On August 4, 2010, Jones was called into the United States squad for an August 10 friendly against Brazil. The next day, however, he withdrew from the squad due to fitness concerns related to his injury from the previous season. Jones was included on the roster for the U.S. national team's friendlies against Poland and Colombia in October. He made his debut for the United States against Poland and assisted Jozy Altidore on the game's opening goal in the 13th minute.\n\nOn June 19, 2011, Jones scored his first international goal in the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup against Jamaica. On January 21, 2012, he captained the side in the 1–0 win over Venezuela in a friendly match. On May 26, 2012, Jones scored his second international goal in a 5–1 victory over Scotland in a friendly match.\n\nOn June 16, 2014, Jones made his FIFA World Cup debut by starting and playing 90 minutes in a 2–1 victory over Ghana. In the next group stage game, with the U.S. down 1–0 against Portugal, Jones scored the equalizing goal with a curling strike from 25 yards out. The game ended in a 2–2 draw. Despite a 1–0 loss to Jones' native Germany in the final group stage match, the U.S. advanced to the round of 16. The U.S. were eventually eliminated in the knockout stage by Belgium 2–1.\n\nIn May 2016, he was among the 40 players selected for the U.S. 2016 Copa America preliminary roster and went on to be named the Man of the Match following a win against Costa Rica. Jones was the highest rated player for the U.S. for the Copa América Centenario in June 2016.\n\nHe married Sarah Gerthe in 2007. Together they have five children: Keanu, Liya-Joelle, Kenyon, Junius, and Jadee-Mae. \n\nGerthe filed a restraining order against Jones in early 2019, claiming he followed her around town and sent her \"inappropriate, antagonistic and degrading messages.\" The couple filed for divorce in July 2019.\n\nIn 2018, a restraining order was filed against Jones by actor David Charvet who alleged that Jones stalked him and sent him threatening text messages.\n\nHe is a good friend of the former female soccer player and current manager of the German female national soccer team Steffi Jones, who is also a German-American dual national and the child of an African American soldier. They both played for the same club, SV Bonames, albeit not at the same time. The two are not related.\n\nRef.:\n\n"}

Rosenthal, a flour merchant, and Elsa Rosenthal (née Kirschstein). He entered the University of Berlin in 1932, where he studied classics and oriental languages and civilizations. His teachers were Carl Becker (1876–1933), Richard Walzer (1900–75), and Hans Heinrich Schaeder (1896–1957). He received his Ph.D. in 1935 with a dissertation, supervised by Schaeder, on Palmyrenian inscriptions (\"Die Sprache der Palmyränischen Inschriften\").\n\nAfter teaching for a year in Florence, Italy, he became instructor at the Lehranstalt (formerly Hochschule) für die Wissenschaft des Judentums, a rabbinical seminary in Berlin. In 1938, he completed his history of Aramaic studies, which was awarded the Lidzbarski Medal and Prize from the Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft. The prize money was withheld from him because he was Jewish, yet on Schaeder's initiative, he was given a prize medal in gold to compensate him for the loss.\n\nShortly after the infamous Kristallnacht, Rosenthal left Germany in December 1938 and went to Sweden, where he was invited through the offices of the Swedish historian of religions H.S. Nyberg (1889–1974). From there he went to England, where he arrived in April 1939, and eventually came to the United States in 1940, having received an invitation to join the faculty of the Hebrew Union College (HUC) in Cincinnati, Ohio. He became a US citizen in 1943 and during the war worked on translations from Arabic for the Office of Strategic Services in Washington, D.C. Following the war, he returned to academia, first at HUC and then in 1948 moved to the University of Pennsylvania. In 1956, he was appointed the Louis M. Rabinowitz Professor of Semitic Languages at Yale. He became a Sterling Professor in 1967 and emeritus in 1985.\n\nProfessor Rosenthal was a prolific and highly accomplished scholar who contributed much to the development of source-critical studies in Arabic in the US. His publications range from a monograph on \"Humor in Early Islam\" to a three-volume annotated translation of the \"Muqaddimah\" of Ibn Khaldun to a \"Grammar of Biblical Aramaic\". For his translation of the Muqaddimah, he traveled to Istanbul and studied the manuscript there, among them Ibn Khaldun's autographed copy. His 1952 \"History of Muslim Historiography\" was the first study of this enormous subject. He wrote extensively on Islamic civilization, including \"The Muslim Concept of Freedom\", \"The Classical Heritage in Islam\", \"The Herb: Hashish versus Medieval Muslim Society\", \"Gambling in Islam\", \"On Suicide in Islam\" and \"Sweeter Than Hope: Complaint and Hope in Medieval Islam\", \"Knowledge Triumphant: The Concept of Knowledge in Medieval Islam\" (Leiden: EJ. Brill, 1970), as well as three volumes of collected essays and two volumes of translations from the Arabic text of the history of the medieval Persian historian al-Tabari, Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk (History of the Prophets and Kings). Rosenthal continued to publish in German and in English. His books have been translated into Arabic, Russian, and Turkish.\n\n\nPresident of the American Oriental Society\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2130253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2130253", "title": "Dovecote", "text": "Dovecote\n\nA dovecote or dovecot or doocot (Scots: \"doocot\") is a structure intended to house pigeons or doves. Dovecotes may be free-standing structures in a variety of shapes, or built into the end of a house or barn. They generally contain pigeonholes for the birds to nest. Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically in the Middle East and Europe and were kept for their eggs and dung.\n\nThe oldest dovecotes are thought to have been the fortified dovecotes of Upper Egypt, and the domed dovecotes of Iran. In these regions, the droppings were used by farmers for fertilizing. Pigeon droppings were also used for leather tanning and making gunpowder. \nIn some cultures, particularly Medieval Europe, the possession of a dovecote was a symbol of status and power and was consequently regulated by law. Only nobles had this special privilege known as \"droit de colombier\". Many ancient manors in France and the United Kingdom have a dovecote (still standing or in ruins) in one section of the manorial enclosure or in nearby fields. Examples include Château de Kerjean in Brittany, France, Houchin, France, Bodysgallen Hall in Wales, and Muchalls Castle and Newark Castle in Scotland.\n\nThe presence of dovecotes is not noted in France before the Roman invasion of Gaul by Caesar. The pigeon farm was then a passion in Rome: the Roman, generally round, \"columbarium\" had its interior covered with a white coating of marble powder. Varro, Columella and Pliny the Elder wrote about pigeon farms and dovecote construction. In the city of Rome in the time of the Republic and the Empire the internal design of the banks of pigeonholes was adapted for the purpose of disposing of cremated ashes after death: these columbaria were generally constructed underground.\n\nThe French word for dovecote is \"pigeonnier\" or . In some French provinces, especially Normandy, the dovecotes were built of wood in a very stylized way. Stone was the other popular building material for these old dovecotes. These stone structures were usually built in circular, square and occasionally octagonal form. Some of the medieval French abbeys had very large stone dovecotes on their grounds.\n\nIn Brittany, the dovecote was sometimes built directly into the upper walls of the farmhouse or manor-house. In rare cases, it was built into the upper gallery of the lookout tower (for example at the Toul-an-Gollet manor in Plesidy, Brittany). Dovecotes of this type are called \"tour-fuie\" in French.\n\nEven some of the larger \"château-forts\", such as the Château de Suscinio in Morbihan, still have a complete dovecote standing on the grounds, outside the moat and walls of the castle.\n\nIn France, it was called a \"colombier\" or \"fuie\" from the 13th century onwards and \"pigeonnier\" until the 19th century.\n\nThe dovecote interior, the space granted to the pigeons, is divided into a number of \"boulins\" (pigeon holes). Each boulin is the lodging of a pair of pigeons. These boulins can be in rock, brick or cob (adobe) and installed at the time of the construction of the dovecote or be in pottery (jars lying sideways, flat tiles, etc.), in braided wicker in the form of a basket or of a nest. It is the number of \"boulins\" that indicates the capacity of the dovecote. The one at the chateau d'Aulnay with its 2,000 boulins and the one at Port-d'Envaux with its 2,400 boulins of baked earth are among the largest ones in France.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, particularly in France, the possession of a \"colombier à pied\" (dovecote on the ground accessible by foot), constructed separately from the \"corps de logis\" of the manor-house (having boulins from the top down), was a privilege of the seigneurial lord. He was granted permission by his overlord to build a dovecote or two on his estate lands. For the other constructions, the dovecote rights (\"droit de colombier\") varied according to the provinces. They had to be in proportion to the importance of the property, placed in a floor above a henhouse, a kennel, a bread oven, even a wine cellar. Generally, the aviaries were integrated into a stable, a barn or a shed, and were permitted to use no more than of arable land.\n\nAlthough they produced an excellent fertilizer (known as \"colombine\"), the lord's pigeons were often seen as a nuisance by the nearby peasant farmers, in particular when sowing new crops. In numerous regions (in France) where the right to possess a dovecote was reserved solely for the nobility (Brittany, Normandy, etc.), the complaint rolls very frequently recorded formal requests for the suppression of this privilege and a law for its abolition, which was finally ratified on 4 August 1789 in France.\n\nDovecotes in Greece are known as Περιστεριώνες, \"Peristeriones\" (plural). Such structures are very popular in the Cycladic islands and in particular Tinos, which has more than 1000 dovecotes. The systematic breeding of doves and pigeons as sources of meat and fertilizer was introduced by the Venetians in the 15th century. Dovecotes are built in slopes protected by the prevailing north wind and oriented so that their facade is towards an open space. In Tinos, the facades of dovecotes are decorated with folklore motifs constructed with local schist rocks that give them an exquisite appearance.\n\nDovecotes were included in several of the villa designs of Andrea Palladio. As an integral part of the World Heritage Site \"Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto\", dovecotes such as those at Villa Barbaro enjoy a high level of protection.\n\nDovecotes in Belgium are mostly associated with pigeon racing. They have special features, such as trap doors that allow pigeons to fly in, but not out. The Flemish word for dovecote is \"duivenkot\". The Dutch word for dovecote is \"duiventoren\", or \"duiventil\" for a smaller dovecot.\n\nDovecotes in Spain are known as a Palomar or Palomares (plural). These structures are very popular in the Tierra de Campos region and also has a scale model of this type of building at a Theme Park located in the Mudéjar de Olmedo. Other good examples are located at Museums located in Castroverde de Campos, (Zamora Province), Villafáfila, (Zamora Province), Santoyo, (Palencia Province) and the famous \"Palomar de la Huerta Noble\" in the municipality of Isla Cristina (Huelva Province) which was built in the 18th century to house 36,000 pigeons.\n\nThe Szekely people of Transylvania incorporate a dovecote into the design of their famous gates. These intricately carved wooden structures feature a large arch with a slatted door, which is meant to admit drivers of carriages and wagons (although today the visitors are probably driving cars and trucks), and a smaller arch with a similar door for pedestrians. Across the top of the gate is a dovecote with 6-12 or more pigeonholes and a roof of wooden shingles or tiles.\n\nThe Romans may have introduced dovecotes or \"columbaria\" to Britain since pigeon holes have been found in Roman ruins at Caerwent. However, it is believed that doves were not commonly kept there until after the Norman invasion. The earliest known examples of dove-keeping occur in Norman castles of the 12th century (for example, at Rochester Castle, Kent, where nest-holes can be seen in the keep), and documentary references also begin in the 12th century. The earliest surviving, definitely dated free-standing dovecote in England was built in 1326 at Garway in Herefordshire. The Welsh name \"colomendy\" has itself become a place name (similarly in Cornwall:colomen & ty = dove house). One Medieval Dovecote still remains standing at Potters Marston in Leicestershire, a hamlet near to the village of Stoney Stanton. Although works have been carried out to restore this Dovecote, it still stands on the site of Potters Marston Hall.\n\nEarly purpose-built doocots in Scotland are often of a \"beehive\" shape, circular in plan and tapering up to a domed roof with a circular opening at the top. These are also found in the North of England and are sometimes referred to as \"tun-bellied\". In the late 16th century, they were superseded by the \"lectern\" type, rectangular with a mono-pitched roof sloping fairly steeply in a suitable direction. Phantassie Doocot is an unusual example of the beehive type topped with a mono-pitched roof, and Finavon Doocot of the lectern type is the largest doocot in Scotland, with 2,400 nesting boxes. Doocots were built well into the 18th century in increasingly decorative forms, then the need for them died out though some continued to be incorporated into farm buildings as ornamental features. However, the 20th century saw a revival of doocot construction by pigeon fanciers, and dramatic towers clad in black or green painted corrugated iron can still be found on wasteland near housing estates in Glasgow and Edinburgh.\n\nIn the U.S., an alternative English name for dovecotes is derived from the French: pigeonaire. This word is more common than \"dovecote\" in Louisiana and other areas with a heavy Francophonic heritage.\n\nQuébec City, Canada, has a pigeonnier that stands in a square in Old Québec; the Pigeonnier is also the name of the square itself and is where street artists present their shows.\n\nA notable frame dovecote is located at Bowman's Folly, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\n\nTheir location is chosen away from large trees that can house raptors and shielded from prevailing winds and their construction obeys a few safety rules: tight access doors and smooth walls with a protruding band of stones (or other smooth surface) to prohibit the entry of climbing predators (martens, weasels...). The exterior façade was, if necessary, only evenly coated by a horizontal band, in order to prevent their ascent.\n\nThe dovecote materials can be very varied and shape and dimension extremely diverse:\n\n\nInside, a dovecote could be virtually empty (\"boulins\" being located in the walls from bottom to top), the interior reduced to only housing a rotating ladder, or \"potence\", that facilitated maintenance and the collection of eggs and squabs.\n\nGable and rooftop dovecotes are associated with storybook houses with whimsical design elements.\n\n\n"}

There are about 6,000 apartments in Tensta and a population of 17,083 as of December 31, 2007.\n\nModern Tensta, with its Plattenbau-style concrete apartment buildings, was constructed in the 1960s. Like nearby Rinkeby and Hjulsta, it was part of the Million Programme, and became known nationwide in the late 1960s. This was partially because many people moved in when the area was still a construction site, and it took years before the metro station opened (in 1975).\n\nIn the center of Tensta there is a small fruit market. The art gallery \"Tensta Konsthall\" is also situated close to the centre and has gained a name in Sweden and abroad.\n\nThe government has decided to award to 200 million kronor ($30 million) in performance based subsidies to boost fifteen of Sweden’s suburbs grappling with social exclusion. Tensta is one of the suburbs that have chosen to receive this cash injection.\nThe districts will receive the cash injection at the end of 2013 at the earliest, after the results from the past year have been evaluated. The subsidy - which is performance based - will be awarded for three criteria: how the areas deal with education, employment, and social benefits.\n\nIn the 2011-13 period, about 53% of the population originated outside the EU and the Nordic Countries.\n\nIn its December 2015 report, Police in Sweden placed the district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates.\n\nWhen the farm of Stora Tensta was demolished in the 1960s, it had probably stood on the same site for more than a thousand years.\n\nTensta is situated on the Järva field, which was used as a military training ground from 1907. The area was closed to the public. Several farms continued growing crops and raising livestock throughout the time the army exercised here, but the farmers were not allowed to cultivate virgin soil or erect new building.\n\nIn 1962 the government decided that almost the whole training ground should be made available for civil buildings. The aim was to build enough homes to eliminate the housing shortage. People living in cramped city flats without modern conveniences, and all the people moving to Stockholm, would acquire spacious and comfortable homes.\nThe construction of Tensta went very fast. The general plan was approved in 1965. People began to move in two years later, and Tensta Centre was opened in 1970. The first inhabitants, mostly families with young children, lived for many years as pioneers on a building site with provisional bus lines, temporary food stores in huts, unfinished paths, and inadequate social service. The Metro (also known as Tunnelbana) came to Tensta in 1975. The lime-lined avenue of Tenstagången leads straight through the district.\n"}

Her work is represented in many public collections, including the City of Burnaby Permanent Art Collection, Winnipeg Art Gallery, Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal, and the National Gallery of Canada and the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec.\n\nGoodwin was born in Montreal, the only child of Romanian immigrants Clare Edith and Abraham Roodish. She enjoyed painting and drawing as a child, and was encouraged by her mother to pursue art. Goodwin's father, a factory owner in Montreal, died when she was nine. After graduating from high school, she studied design at Valentine's Commercial School of Art in Montreal.\n\nGoodwin launched her career as a painter and printmaker in the late 1940s. Her work began to be exhibited in Montreal in the early '60s. In the 1960s, she enrolled in a printmaking class with Yves Gaucher at Sir George Williams University in Montreal. It was there where she began working with found objects and clothing in her prints, which brought her international attention. Dissatisfied with her work, she destroyed most of it and in 1968 she limited herself to drawing.\n\nGoodwin represented Canada at the Tokyo International Print Biennial in 1974, and the Ljubljana Biennial of Graphic Arts in 1975. She received the Prix Paul-Émile Borduas in 1986.\n\nGoodwin again represented Canada at the São Paulo Biennial in 1989.\n\nGoodwin used a variety of media, including collage, sculpture, printmaking, painting and drawing, assemblage and etchings. Her subject matter almost always revolves around the human form and deals with it in a highly emotional way. Many of her ideas came from clusters of photographs, objects or drawings on the walls in her studio. She also used the \"germ\" of ideas that are left after being erased from a work. During the 1950s and 60s Goodwin created still life paintings. She also depicted scenes of Montreal's Jewish Community.\n\nGoodwin became interested in found objects, and how they held traces of life. She created copper plate impressions of items of clothing to produce a series of etchings, entitled \"Vest,\" which gained international attention. Goodwin created a series of wall hangings entitled \"Tarpaulin\" from 1972 to 1974, which she reworked to shape into sculptures and collages. She received the Victor Martyn Lynch-Staunton Award of the Canada Council for the Arts in 1981.\n\nOver a period of six years beginning in 1982, Goodwin explored the human form in her drawing series \"Swimmers,\" this project used graphite, oil pastels and charcoal on translucent Mylar. The large-scale drawings depict solitary floating or sinking bodies, suspended in space. In 1986, to show the interaction of human figures she created her series \"Carbon\" using charcoal and wax to create drawings. She earned a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship in 1988.\n\nAfter representing Canada at the Venice Biennial in 1995, she was presented with the Gershon Iskowitz Prize of the Gershon Iskowitz Foundation and the Art Gallery of Ontario. In 1996 Goodwin donated 150 of her works to the Art Gallery of Ontario, which has the largest collection of her work. The Gallery staged a major retrospective that year, and she was awarded the Harold Town Prize. That year she was acknowledged with an exhibition at the National Gallery of Canada, \"Betty Goodwin: Signs of Life\". In 2003, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. She died in December 2008 in Montreal.\n\nShe was married to Martin Goodwin, a civil engineer (d. 2008).

The maximum number of colors that can be displayed at any one time is 256 or 2.\n\nIn order to turn a 24-bit image into an 8-bit image, the image must go through a process called color quantization. Color quantization is the process of creating a color map for a less color dense image from a more dense image. The simplest form of quantization frequently called 8-bit truecolor is to simply assign 3 bits to red, 3 to green and 2 to blue (the human eye is less sensitive to blue light) to create a 3-3-2\n\n8-bit color image, but this process is sub optimal. There could be different groupings of colors that make evenly spreading the colors out inefficient and likely to misrepresent the actual image. Because the color map doesn't need to have every color in it and just needs to accurately represent the more color dense image, an arbitrary color can be assigned to each of the 256 available color 'slots' on the map. Popular approaches for creating these maps include the \"popularity algorithm\" which chooses the 256 most common colors and creates a map from them. The more accurate \"median-cut\" algorithm resorts and divides colors to find the median of different color groups resulting in a more accurate final color map.\n\nBecause of the low amount of memory and resultant higher speeds of 8-bit color images, 8-bit color was a common ground among computer graphics development until more memory and higher CPU speeds became readily available to consumers. 8-bit color was used in many different applications including:\n\nMost notably, the VGA standard for graphical interface uses a 8-bit color. Developed in 1987 by IBM, the VGA interface supported a maximum resolution of 640x480 pixels. Many different image types such as GIF and TIFF use an 8-bit color system to store data.\n\nEven though it is now outdated for most consumer applications, 8-bit color encoding can still be useful in imaging systems with limited data bandwidth or memory capacity. For example, both Mars Exploration Rovers used an 8-bit grayscale format for navigation imaging. \n\nDue to the nature of the 8-bit system, most images have different color maps. Since an 8-bit color display can't display two images with different color maps at the same time, it is usually impossible to display two different 8-bit images on the same such display at the same time. In practice, in order to avoid this problem, most images don't use the full range of 256 colors. Another problem comes when doing image processing: whenever two images with different color maps are added to each other, the resulting image has to have a new color map created, meaning another quantization operation has to occur, making the resulting image an imperfect version of the expected result.\n\nCurrently, most graphics hardware runs in 24-bit truecolor or 32-bit truecolor (24-bit truecolor and an 8-bit alpha channel). However, some remote desktop software (Virtual Network Computing, Remote Desktop Protocol) can switch to 8-bit color to conserve bandwidth. With the comparative low cost and high speeds of modern computers, some image editing is even done in a raw format with anywhere from 12-14 bits from each of the camera's image sensor pixels in order to avoid image quality reduction while editing.\n\n"}

Both of his parents had musical backgrounds and they got him into piano lessons at the age of 5. His father was in a band, sang and played multiple instruments and his mother sang in the church choir. They lived in the projects and when Manuel was 10, his father left the family, moving back to Chicago. His mother was a school teacher and worked hard to get her and her children a home. By the time Manuel was in high school, his mother had purchased a home that he and his sisters still share today. Because his grade school did not offer guitar, Manuel started playing the flute at that time. He was already excelling at the piano and wanted to learn every instrument he could. By high school, he had formed a band and traveled to the few towns near him to perform. He was performing at bars (while being underage) and picked up a huge fan base throughout the Midwest. He traveled extensively, performing and perfecting his skills as a musician.\n\nManuel Seal was found by a manager while working with Grammy Award-winning artist Ann Nesby. He and Ann had known each other for years, as they are from the same two small towns. His manager had gotten him meetings in LA and he stayed there for three months working at BMG.

It is divided into four wings, with the 1st Wing at Kabul, the 2nd Wing at Kandahar, the 3rd Wing at Shindand, and the 4th Wing at Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan. Lt. Gen. Mohammad Dawran has served as Chief of Staff of the Afghan Air Force and Gen. Abdul Fahim Ramin as the Afghan Air Force Commander. The command center of the Afghan Air Force is located at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. The Shindand Air Base in Herat Province serves as the main training facility.\n\nThe Afghan Air Force was established in 1924 under the reign of King Amanullah and significantly modernized by King Zahir Shah in the 1960s. During the 1980s, the Soviet Union built up the Afghan Air Force, first in an attempt to defeat the mujahideen and in hopes that strong Afghan airpower would preserve the pro-Soviet government of Najibullah. The Afghan Air Force had over 400 aircraft, including more than 200 Soviet-made fighter jets. The collapse of Najibullah's government in 1992 and the continuation of a civil war throughout the 1990s reduced the number of Afghan aircraft to less than a dozen. During Operation Enduring Freedom in late 2001, in which the Taliban government was ousted from power, all that remained of the AAF was a few helicopters.\n\nSince 2007, the NATO Combined Air Power Transition Force (CAPTF), which was renamed the NATO Air Training Command-Afghanistan (NATC-A) in 2010, has worked to rebuild and modernize the Afghan Air Force. The CAPTF / NATC-A serves as the air component of the NATO Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan which is responsible for rebuilding the Afghan Armed Forces. The AAF currently has about 183 aircraft and over 7,000 airmen. The Resolute Support Mission wants to raise the ranks of the AAF to 8,000 airmen and increase the number of aircraft, which are progressively getting more advanced.\n\nThe Afghan Air Force began on 22 August 1924, when the Afghan Air Force was established. In 1924 and 1925 it saw action when it fought against the Khost rebellion. As early as 1921, the Soviet Union and Great Britain provided a small number of aircraft to Afghanistan's King Amanullah Khan who had been impressed with the British use of aircraft against his government in 1919, however they were not made into a separate air arm until 1924. For the next decade, Soviet pilots performed the bulk of the flying and equipping for the AAF, probably about one-half of the aircraft were Polikarpov R-1s, a Soviet copy of the de Havilland DH.9A. Most AAF aircraft were destroyed in the civil war that began in December 1928, and it was not before 1937 that a serious rebuilding effort began. From the late 1930s until World War II, British Hawker Hind and Italian IMAM Ro.37 aircraft constituted the bulk of the Afghan Air Force, which by 1938 amounted to about 30 planes in service. The Hawker Hind remained in the Afghan inventory until 1957, and as of 2009 one former Afghan Air Force Hawker Hind still flew in the Shuttleworth Collection. In 1947, the Air Force was redesignated the Royal Afghan Air Force (RAAF), a title it retained until further political upheaval in 1973.\n\nBy 1960, the Royal Afghan Air Force consisted of approximately 100 combat aircraft including MiG-15 fighters, Il-28 light bombers, transports, and a few helicopters. Also by that time, a small number of Afghan pilots were undergoing undergraduate pilot training in the United States, while others attended training in the Soviet Union, India, and several European countries. In the \"bloodless\" 1973 Saur Revolution, King Zahir Shah was deposed and Mohammed Daoud Khan became the country's president. During his five years in power, until the Communist coup of 1978, Daoud gained Soviet assistance to upgrade the capabilities and increase the size of the Afghan Air Force, introducing newer models of Soviet MiG-21 fighters and An-24 and An-26 transports. In 1979 the Air Force lost four Mi-8s. Improvements in the early-to-mid-1970s notwithstanding, the Afghan Air Force remained relatively small until after the 1979–80 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. While the Afghan Air Force was equipped with a large inventory – probably some 400 aircraft in the mid-1980s – many of them were manned and maintained by advisors from Czechoslovakia and Cuba. In many cases, the Soviets were reluctant to entrust Afghan pilots with either the latest aircraft models or high priority missions and, indeed, a number of Afghan pilots were equally reluctant to conduct air strikes against their countrymen. The Afghan Air Force was at its strongest in the 1980s and early 1990s, producing some concern on the part of neighboring countries. The Air Force had at least 7,000 personnel plus 5,000 foreign advisors. At its peak, the Air Force had at least 240 fixed-wing combat aircraft (fighters, fighter-bombers, light bombers), 150 helicopters, and perhaps 40 or more Antonov transports of various models. Midway through the Soviet-Afghan war, one estimate of Afghan air power listed the following inventory:\n\nAdditionally, the Afghan Air Force probably operated some 40 or more transports, including the An-26, An-24, and An-2. Another estimate in 1988 painted a more detailed picture of the Afghan Air Force:\n\nAfter the Soviet withdrawal and the departure of foreign advisors, the Air Force declined in terms of operational capability. With the collapse of the Najibullah Government in 1992, the Air Force splintered, breaking up amongst the different mujahideen factions in the ongoing civil war. By the end of the 1990s, the military of the Taliban maintained five supersonic MIG-21MFs and 10 Sukhoi-22 fighter-bombers. They also held six Mil Mi-8 helicopters, five Mi-35s, five L-39Cs, six An-12s, 25 An-26s, a dozen An-24/32s, an IL-18, and a Yakovlev.\nThe Afghan Northern Alliance/United Front operated a small number of helicopters and transports and a few other aircraft for which it depended on assistance from neighboring Tajikistan.\nWith the breakdown of logistical systems, the cannibalization of surviving airframes was widespread. The US/Coalition operations in the fall of 2001 destroyed most of the remaining Afghan aircraft. It was 2005 before a US-led, international effort began to rebuild the Afghan Air Force; since 2007, the pace has increased significantly under the auspices of the Combined Air Power Transition Force.\n\nThe Mil Mi-24 and Mi-35 (export model) attack helicopters have a long history in Afghanistan. The aircraft was operated extensively during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, mainly for attacking Afghan mujahideen fighters. Early in the war, the only anti-air weapons of the mujahideen were Soviet made shoulder-launched, heat-seeking SAMs and American Redeye, which had either been captured from the Soviets or their Afghan allies or were supplied from Western sources. Many of them came from stocks the Israelis had captured during their wars with Soviet client states in the Middle East. Owing to a combination of the limited capabilities of these early types of missiles, poor training and poor material condition of the missiles, they were not particularly effective.\n\nBeginning in 1986, the US supplied the mujahideen with its state-of-the-art heat-seeking missile, the Stinger, which the Afghans employed with devastating effect. In the first use of the Stinger in Afghanistan, mujahideen fighters downed three of eight unsuspecting Soviet Mi-24 Hinds as they approached the airfield at Jalalabad on a late September afternoon. Some scholars point to that event in 1986 as the turning point in the war. Moreover, for most of the remainder of the war when Stingers were known to be present, Soviet and Afghan aircraft elected to remain at higher altitudes where they were less vulnerable to the missile, but also less effective in ground attacks. Although employed extensively throughout the war as a ground attack platform, the Hind suffered from a weak tail boom and was found to be underpowered for some missions it was called upon to perform in the mountains of Afghanistan, where high density altitude is especially problematic for rotary-wing aircraft.\n\nOverall, the Hind proved effective and very reliable, earning the respect of both Soviet and Afghan pilots as well as ordinary Afghans throughout the country. The mujahideen nicknamed the Mi-24 the \"Devil's Chariot\" due to its notorious reputation. Since the end of the Soviet-Afghan war, the civil war of the 1990s, and the post-11 September 2001 US/Coalition operations, the Afghan Air Force (AAF) is again using the Mi-35 Hind.\n\nFor the first time in over two decades Afghanistan has begun training new pilots. In January 2008, President Hamid Karzai said that his country's Air Force had been reborn after inaugurating its new headquarters at Kabul International Airport freshly equipped with new aircraft. The military had received 26 new and refurbished aircraft, including Czech-donated Mi-35 Hind helicopter gunships. With United States funding the Afghan government had also acquired transport helicopters and a number of Ukrainian military planes. Under a partnering relationship between the US-led, international NATO Air Training Command (NATC-A) and the AAF, Afghan air power is being rebuilt on several fronts:\n\nThe recently opened North Kabul International Airport cantonment area includes the new headquarters for the Afghan Air Force and 201st Kabul Air Wing. The wing's three operational squadrons, one fixed-wing, one rotary-wing, and the Presidential Airlift Squadron, are housed there. The cantonment area includes state-of-the-art hangars as well as operations, logistics, billeting, dining, and recreational facilities. Additionally, extensive AAF facilities are in-progress at Kandahar International Airport.\n\nA number of Afghan pilots and pilot-candidates traveled to the United States beginning in May 2009 for English language training, to be followed by instrument training for the pilots and undergraduate pilot training for the pilot-candidates. This was the start of an initiative that within the next several years should produce a small cadre of seasoned, instrument-rated Afghan Air Force pilots as well as a larger number of younger, well-trained pilots who will serve as the backbone of the Afghan Air Force for the next generation. Other NATC-A-led programs include English language and technical courses for AAF personnel in various specialties including aircraft maintenance, logistics, communications, and engineering. As of June 2009, the Air Force numbered about 2,400 airmen, with a planned strength of 7,400 airmen within several years.\n\nIn late 2009, the AAF began receiving refurbished former Italian Air Force C-27A tactical transports and Mi-17V5 Hip transport helicopters. In June 2010 the Afghan National Army Air Corps became a separate and independent service and was renamed the \"Afghan Air Force\" by order of Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Also in the same year, a number of female trainers completed their courses and were commissioned as lieutenants. Many more are being trained as the number of the AAF increases.\n\nAs of March 2011, the Afghan Air Force (AAF) had 44 rotary-wing and 13 fixed-wing aircraft in serviceable condition. By the end of 2011, the AAF had 16 C-27As (on loan from the U.S government) and 35 of the new Mi-8 Hips while continuing to operate the older Mi-17s and retiring the An-32 fleet. Further growth of the AAF may depend on decisions yet to be made regarding the size of the Afghan National Army which, in turn, will determine AAF requirements. In a country of rugged terrain possessing limited ground transportation options, the Afghan Armed Forces depends heavily upon AAF fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft for airlift of soldiers and supplies between corps operating locations, medical and casualty evacuation, and transport of human remains. The Afghan government also relied on the AAF for transportation of election materials during the 2009 presidential election. It was announced in October 2011 that the Afghan Air Force would be provided with 145 multi-type aircraft and 21 helicopters. By the end of 2011, the Afghan Air Force had a total of 4,900 airmen and personnel.\n\nBy 2016 the Afghan Air Force was planned to expand to 8,000 airmen and will operate 145 aircraft. To that end there has been continuing expansion in infrastructure, training and maintenance facilities. The US has also been purchasing modern equipment and aircraft including Russian Mi-17 helicopters. Significant investment has also gone into purchasing modern training aircraft such as MD 500 helicopters and fixed-wing Cessna 182 and 208 planes.\n\nIn 2016-17, the United States Department of Defense (DOD) aimed to procure 30 additional armed MD-530F helicopters and 6 additional A-29 attack aircraft to replace the Mil Mi-35 in service with the AAF. DOD asked for funds to add an additional five AC-208s to the fleet. The requested FY2017 Afghan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) budget, including the 23 additional funds for the first year of the planned procurement, went to Congress on 10 November 2016.\n\nAs of November 2019, the Afghan Air Force has at least 183 aircraft and approximately 6,800 personnel. There are four Afghan Air Force wings:\n\n\nAbdul Raziq Sherzai serves as a major general and commander of the Kandahar Air Wing.\n\nIn 2013 Afghanistan sent India a large wish-list of equipment which included one An-32 and two Squadrons of Mi-17 and Mi-35 helicopters. This deal was initially put on hold due to fears of antagonizing India's regional rival Pakistan, but in 2014 India reached a compromise where instead of directly supplying the equipment it would instead pay Russia to deliver them instead. This deal includes arms, ammo and the refurbishment of weapon systems and aircraft left behind by the Soviets.\n\nIndia further agreed to help refurbish older Soviet-era aircraft in Afghan Air Force. As a part of this two Indian Air Force teams visited Afghanistan and identified around 50 aircraft which can be serviced and brought back to active service in Afghanistan. This included Mi-25/35, Mi-8 and An-32s aircraft.\n\nTwenty attack aircraft that can also be used for training and to provide the Army with close air support were desired. The two contenders were the Embraer A-29 Super Tucano and the Beechcraft AT-6. Embraer won the previous contract but the tendering process was cancelled after it was discovered that proper procedures were not followed. A winner for the new contract was expected in June 2013 with first deliveries expected to begin in the third quarter of 2014, about 15 months after originally planned. The Super Tucano was declared the winner of the contract again in 2013. The contract was to be completed by Sierra Nevada Corp. for 20 A-29 Super Tucanos with an expected delivery date of between December 2015 and 2018. DOD purchased the Super Tucanos for $427 million. \n\nThe first ten aircraft were to be stationed at Shindand Air Base, in western Afghanistan. The other 10 were to go to Kandahar Airfield.\n\nPilot training was undertaken by the U.S. Air Force's 81st Fighter Squadron at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia. On 18 December 2015, the first Super Tucano pilots graduated at Moody AFB. USAF Colonel John Nichols, the 14th Flying Training Wing Commander said of the pilots, \"The extraordinary dedication of these pilots and the sacrifices these graduates have made will help establish a secure, stable and unified country\". The pilot graduates and the remaining 22 student pilots were to receive further, advisory support in Afghanistan.\n\nThe first four aircraft arrived at Hamid Karzai International Airport on 15 January 2016, with a further four due before the end of 2016. Combat-ready Afghan Super Tucano pilots graduated from training at Moody AFB returned to Afghanistan, the first of a total of 30 pilots the USAF trained. \n\nBy March 2018, the AAF had 12 Super Tucanos in service. On 22 March 2018, the Afghan Air Force dropped a GBU-58 Paveway II bomb from an Super Tucano in combat, the first time the AAF dropped a laser-guided weapon against the Taliban.\n\nThe U.S. Navy equipped the Afghan Air Force with refurbished An-32 transport aircraft during initial reconstruction efforts. These aircraft augmented an existing fleet of An-32 and An-26 aircraft. The An-32 was retired on 17 June 2011 in a push to move operations over to the C27 program but like the L-39, it is still kept in ready status by the Afghan Air Force.\n\nThe United States purchased the C-27A to move the AAF away from Soviet aircraft. A total of 20 former Italian military C-27As were purchased with the intent of providing the Afghan Air Force a fleet that would last 10 years. However, the prime contractor in the refurbishment and supply of the planes, Alenia Aermacchi North America, a unit of Italian defense conglomerate Finmeccanica S.p.A., was unable to provide adequate maintenance support for the aircraft. As a result, the majority of the fleet at any time was grounded for safety of flight issues (including a period where the entire fleet was grounded for over 6 months). The US military worked over the course of three years with Alenia North America to get the fleet fully operational.\n\nPart of the issues with supplying the C-27As came about from ownership. The C-27A program included an initial parts supply and training contract for the Afghan Air Force. Upon arrival of the first two aircraft in November 2009, Brig. Gen. Michael R. Boera, commanding general, Combined Air Power Transition Force and commander of the 438th Air Expeditionary Wing announced that the aircraft were part of the Afghan National Army Air Corps in a ceremony at Kabul International Airport. The contract for the aircraft, a 14-month effort, had the U.S. government as the end user of the aircraft due to an Italian arms embargo with Afghanistan. The U.S. declaration that the C-27A was now an Afghan Air Force asset effectively violated international law and the Italian government enforced the embargo and stopped shipment of contracted supplies to Afghanistan. This put the U.S. government in a dilemma since the $290 million contract was funded through the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) which required, by U.S. law, that all military materials purchased be turned over to the Afghan government.\n\nThe C-27A was eventually determined to be a U.S. owned asset utilized by the Afghan Air Force with intent to turn over the asset in the future. This determination assumed that the Italian embargo would at some point be lifted, or that enough supplies could be stock piled to take the aircraft through its expected 10-year service life, but that determination was not immediate. This caused a delay of contracted goods beyond the time frame of the initial contract through no fault of the contractor, and made it necessary for the U.S. government to enter into a second more costly maintenance contract with Alenia North America to get aircraft operational. Since the C-27A aircraft purchased still had Italian military air worthiness certificates controlled by the company, Alenia North America effectively monopolized the entire supply chain making fair competition non-existent. This second contract inflated the total program cost to over $600 million, and it would have cost over $1.2 billion had the U.S. opted to extend the contract up to 10 years.\n\nThe contract with Alenia North America was eventually terminated. It was announced that the contractor had failed to meet their legal obligations, and that the Afghan Air Force would receive four Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, expected in 2013. The G-222 program legacy to the C-130 is that the cockpit and cargo compartment configurations of the C-27A are similar to that of a C-130H. The C-27A simulator program, contracted to Fidelity Technologies Corporation, produced three C-27A simulators: one Fuselage Load Trainer (cargo compartment), one Flight Training Device (cockpit), and one Basic Aircraft Training Device (cockpit). These training devices were built to FAA standards from two derelict U.S. Air Force C-27A aircraft and allowed the Afghan Air Force to continue to train while the C-27A fleet was effectively out of service for over a year, making transition to the C-130 a feasible alternative.\n\nThe Mi-17 has been in service with the Afghan Air Force since the late 1970s (four were damaged or destroyed in combat as early as 1979). DOD purchased a number of new Mi-17s for the AAF from Russia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. At least two Mi-17s were reported to have crashed.\n\nThe most recent DOD acquisition of Mi-17s was for 21 airframes, spare parts and training. These all include western avionics. Eighteen of these have been delivered in 2012. As part of the contract, there was also an option for another twelve Mi-17s, raising the contract to 33. They were modified in the UAE after being delivered to the US Army to fit Afghan Air Force requirements better before being sent to Afghanistan.\n\nThe Afghan Air Force has two Mi-17v5 Flight Training Devices, one Mi-17v5 Basic Aircraft Training Device, and one Mi-17 Cockpit Procedure Trainer built by Fidelity Technologies Corporation. The Air Force was expected be in possession of 46 Mi-17 helicopters by June 2012, with an additional 10 to be delivered by 2016.\n\nIn 2017 the decision was made to transition from Russian to U.S. helicopters due to issues with sourcing parts and maintenance because of ongoing diplomatic issues between the US, the AAF main source of funds, and Russia. Consequently, it was decided to replace the AAF Mi-17s with refurbished UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The Department of Defense (DoD) requested $814.5M for 2017, the first year of the plan, to re-equip the Afghan Air Force and to provide funding to procure 53 UH-60s, with refurbishment and modification of the first 18. Long term the US plan to provide 159 UH-60 Black Hawks with funding for the first 53 already being secured in the 2017 budget. The DoD will have to request additional funds each year to procure the rest of the proposed aircraft. Deliveries are expected to start in 2019 with 30 helicopters expected to be delivered each year. The UH-60s are also to be fitted with rocket pods to increase their offensive capability and the first four UH-60s slated for training are expected to arrive in Afghanistan in autumn 2017. The refurbished helicopters will be 1980s UH-60As with new engines with the most likely choice being the General Electric T-700-GE-701C, which is found on the U.S. Army's newer UH-60Ls and Ms, as well as the up-coming UH-60V model.\n\nTraining is undertaken at the Shindand Air Wing at Shindand Air Base in western Afghanistan. The base which has been refurbished and expanded by NATO which tripled its size. The seven candidates are all graduates of the National Military Academy of Afghanistan or Initial Officer Training held in the United Kingdom and have also undertaken English language training in the Kabul English Language Training Center. Students will be trained in both fixed-wing aircraft, namely the Cessna 182T and 208B and in rotary wing aircraft, the MD 530F. About 6 MD 530F helicopters were delivered to Shindand in late 2011. The initial 6 helicopters have completed acceptance flights and can now be used to begin training Afghan Pilots, although one was destroyed in 2013 by an IED. The four-year contract could see as many as 54 other helicopters being supplied to the AAF.\n\nWith the delivery of 20 Advanced fixed-wing light support aircraft, the A-29 Super Tucano Afghan pilots will have to undergo further training. This will significantly increase the level of knowledge and experience in the air force.\n\nThe Afghan Air Force (AAF) deteriorated following the collapse of Najibullah's government in 1992, and it was nearly eliminated by US/Coalition air strikes during Operation Enduring Freedom in late 2001. The new NATO-assembled Afghan Air Force has been gradually increasing its aircraft inventory, personnel, and operational capabilities since at least 2007. The last addition of aircraft was made in December 2011, which included 12 trainers and 6 helicopters from the United States.\n\nDuring its first incarnation, Afghan aircraft carried simple black and white depictions of the Arms of Afghanistan, with the inscription 'God is great' on the underside of the wings. The Afghan flag was possibly used as well. Afghanistan adopted a black, red, and green flag after the 1929 revolt, and when the Air Force was given aircraft again in 1937, it placed this flag on the rudder, and adopted wing and fuselage roundels based on the three colors.\n\nThe Royal Afghan Air Force retained the roundels until adopting a new style in 1967, with a unique insignia consisting of a tri-color triangle using the national colors upon a white disc, on which was inscribed with Arabic lettering forming various phrases. This roundel was placed on the rudder in place of the flag. This remained in use after the overthrow of the monarchy until the Russian invasion in 1979, when a new insignia of a red disc with yellow inscriptions was adopted. This was short-lived however, as in 1983, a more Soviet-standard red star on a white disc ringed in black, red, and green was adopted. These were maintained until after the Soviet departure.\n\nUpon the departure of Soviet forces from Afghanistan, and the fall of the communist government, a return to the triangle insignia was noted, although markings varied depending on the ownership of the aircraft.\n\n\n"}

The culms (flowering stems) are tall, and have alternate leaves that are concentrated at the bottom of the culm. The leaves are light green to blue-green in color, and up to across.\nThe flowers bloom in summer and autumn. They consist of compact spikes that hang alternately in a raceme along the top of the culm. The spikes often fall to one side of the stem, which gives the plant its name. There are 10–50 spikes per culm, and in each spike there are three to six spikelets, or rarely as many as 10. Each spikelet is long and consists of two glumes and two florets. One of the florets is fertile, and has colorful orange to brownish red anthers and feathery white stigmas during the blooming period, which contrasts with the pale green, pale red, greenish-red, or purple color of the spikes themselves.\n\nAfter blooming, the spikes become straw-colored. The fertile florets produce seeds, and when they are ripe, the spikes fall to the ground.\n\nSideoats grama grows well on mountainous plateaus, rocky slopes, and sandy plains. It is drought- and cold-tolerant and is hardy in USDA hardiness zones 4–9 (average annual minimums of ).\n\nIt provides larval food for the veined ctenucha (\"Ctenucha venosa\").\n\nIt is currently listed as a threatened species in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is considered as an endangered species in Connecticut.\n\nSideoats grama is considered a good foraging grass for livestock. It is planted for erosion control.\n\nIt is cultivated as an ornamental plant for native plant and drought-tolerant gardens.\n\nSideoats grama is the state grass of Texas.\n"}

Called Operation Nachshon, and launched before the British had left Palestine, its objective was to capture villages between Jerusalem and the coastal plain.\n\nYaqut al-Hamawi noted about Saris in the 1220s that it was \"a village of the district round Jerusalem. It lies half-way between Jerusalem and Ar Ramlah, and 4 hours from either place\".\n\nDuring Ottoman rule in Palestine, in 1596, Saris was a village in the \"nahiya\" (subdistrict) of Jerusalem under the \"liwa'\" (district) of Jerusalem and it had a population of 53 Muslim households, an estimated 292 persons. The villagers paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat, barley, olives fruit and carob, as well as on goats, beehives and vineyards; a total of 7,098 akçe. A quarter of the revenue went to a Waqf.\n\nIn 1838, Edward Robinson noted \"Saris\" as a Muslim village in the District of \"Beni Malik\", west of Jerusalem, while in 1852 he noted that the village \"belonged feudally\" to the Latham family, of Bayt 'Itab.\n\nIn 1863, the French explorer Victor Guérin found Saris to have an apparently ancient water well, while the houses looked \"dilapidated\". An Ottoman village list of about 1870 counted 57 houses and a population of 169, though the population count included men, only.\n\nIn 1883, the PEF's \"Survey of Western Palestine\" described Saris as being located on top of a hill, with olive trees growing below the village.\n\nIn 1896 the population of Saris was estimated to be about 360 persons.\n\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Saris had a population 373, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 470, still all Muslims, in 114 houses.\n\nIn the 1945 statistics the population of Saris was 560, all Muslims, and it had 10,699 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. 366 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 3,677 for cereals, while 10 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\nOn 13 April, before the village was attacked, Israel Galili wrote to Yosef Weitz of the JNF asking for a settlement to be established at Saris 'as soon as possible.'\n\nOn 17 April 1948 The Scotsman reported 'Jews destroyed a mosque, village school, and 25 houses, killing three women in an attack on the Arab village of Saris early today (16th). There were about 500 attackers.' The New York Times carried the same report and gave the number of Arab dead as seven. A Haganah statement is quoted as saying that the battalion stayed in the village for about five hours, blowing up 25 buildings and burning others.\n\nFollowing the war, the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. The village of Shoresh was established 1 km south west of the remains of Saris in 1948, while Sho'eva was set up 0.5 km north east of the site in 1950, both on land that had belonged to Saris.\n\nThe Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village land in 1992: \"The site is covered with stone rubble; iron bars protrude from the collapsed roofs. There are many open wells and several caves with arched roofs. A large number of trees, including cypress, fig, and almond trees, grow on the site. An abandoned grove of almond trees is located on the eastern side. In the middle of the slope are the remains of an artificial pool. The village cemetery, surrounded by trees, is located southwest of the site. It contains several large tombs, one of which is surrounded by a small, roofless enclosure; an almond tree grows in the center.\" He also noted that two forests had been established in the area by the Jewish National Fund and the Center for European Jewry.\n\n\n"}

Hoover is currently serving six life sentences at the ADX Florence prison in Florence, Colorado. His sentences include a 150–200 year sentence for a 1973 murder; and in 1997, after a 17–year investigation of conspiracy, extortion, money laundering, and running a continuing criminal enterprise for leading the gang from state prison, he received a life sentence.\n\nOn the evening of February 26, 1973, William \"Pooky\" Young, a 19–year old neighborhood youth drug dealer, was abducted and later shot to death in an alley near 68th Street and Union Avenue in Chicago's Englewood neighborhood. His killing was ordered by Hoover after his name was mentioned as one of three people accused of stealing drugs and money from the gang five days earlier. On March 16, 1973, Hoover and Young's killer, Gangster Disciple member Andrew Howard, were both arrested. In November 1973, Howard and Hoover were both charged with murder and sentenced to 150 to 200 years in prison. Hoover was sent to Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois, to serve out his term.\nIn 1974, after the leader of the Black Disciples, David Barksdale, died from kidney failure by an injury due to an earlier shooting, Hoover took the reins of the Black Gangster Disciples Nation while under his wing, which now had control of Chicago's South Side. Under Hoover's rule, the Black Gangster Disciples took over the South Side drug trade. While incarcerated, Hoover helped form the Folks Nation, which added other gangs such as: Black Disciples, Satan Disciples, Ambrose, Two-Two Boys, Gangster Two-Six, Simon City Royals, North Side Insane Popes, La Raza Nation, Spanish Cobras, Imperial Gangsters, Maniac Latin Disciples, Harrison Gents, Spanish Gangster Disciples and Latin Eagles. In 1989, The Black Gangster Disciples started to go against their own merger and ally, the Black Disciples, over a drug dealing dispute in the neighborhood of Englewood, Chicago that escalated into a shooting that killed several people. This infuriated members of BGDs and resulted in them changing their name into the \"Gangster Disciples.\" While Hoover was incarcerated, he ran the gang's illicit drug trade both in prison and on the streets, starting from Chicago's West Side and later extending throughout the United States. By early 1993, Hoover claimed to have renounced his violent criminal past and became an urban political celebrity in Chicago. The Gangster Disciples earned fans in the community with charity events and peaceful protests. Hoover proclaimed that initials GD had changed to mean \"Growth & Development.\" A lengthy federal investigation using wiretaps led to Hoover getting another life sentence in 1995. Hoover's gang allegedly had 30,000 \"soldiers\" in 35 states and made $100 million a year, a total of approximately $3,300.00 per \"soldier\" annually.\nOn August 22, 1995, after a 17-year undercover investigation by the federal government, Hoover was indicted for drug conspiracy, extortion, and continuing to engage in a criminal enterprise. He was arrested at the Dixon Correctional Center by federal agents, and moved to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago to stand trial. In 1997, Hoover was found guilty on all charges. Hoover is currently serving his sentence at the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado.\nOn October 11, 2018, during a luncheon with President Donald Trump, rapper Kanye West pled for clemency for Hoover.\n\n"}

It was started in August 1940 as OCCCRBAR (Office for Coordination of Commercial and Cultural Relations between the American Republics) with Nelson Rockefeller as its head, appointed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nThe Office of Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs in the Executive Office of the President was formally established and enacted by US Executive Order 8840 on July 30, 1941 by President Roosevelt who named Nelson Rockefeller as the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (CIAA).\n\nThe agency's function was to distribute news, films and advertising, and to broadcast radio, in and to Latin America in order to counter Italian and German propaganda there. The OCIAA grew to be a large Federal agency with a budget of $38 million by 1942 and 1,500 employees by 1943.\n\nIt was later renamed the Office of Inter-American Affairs (OIAA) with slightly changed powers by Executive order 9532 on March 23, 1945.\n\nThe Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs was established in August 1940 by order of the U.S. Council of National Defense, and operated with funds from both the government and the private sector. By executive order July 30, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the OCIAA within the Office for Emergency Management of the Executive Office of the President, \"to provide for the development of commercial and cultural relations between the American Republics and thereby increasing the solidarity of this hemisphere and furthering the spirit of cooperation between the Americas in the interest of hemisphere defense.\"\n\nThe mission of the OCIAA was cultural diplomacy, promoting hemispheric solidarity and countering the growing influence of the Axis powers in Latin America. The OCIAA's Motion Picture Division played an important role in documenting history and shaping opinion toward the Allied nations, particularly after the U.S. entered World War II in December 1941. To support the war effort — and for their own audience development throughout Latin America — Hollywood studios partnered with the U.S. government on a nonprofit basis, making films and incorporating Latin American stars and content into their commercial releases.\n\nDuring the 1940s the CBS radio broadcasting network also contributed to the OCIAA's cultural initiatives by establishing the CBS Pan American Orchestra to showcase prominent musical artists from both North and South America on its \"Viva América\" program. Broadcasts to Latin America were coordinated by the OCIAA with CBS' \"La Cadena de Las Américas\" (Network of the Americas) shortwave radio and radiotelephone systems as envisioned by William S. Paley.\nIncluded among the international contributors were: Alfredo Antonini (Italian-American conductor), Terig Tucci (Argentine composer), John Serry Sr. (Italian-American accordionist), Elsa Miranda (Puerto Rican vocalist), Eva Garza (Mexican-American vocalist), Nestor Mesa Chaires (Mexican tenor), Juan Arvizu (Mexican tenor) and Edmund A. Chester (American journalist). The OCIAA also supported cultural programming on the CBS radio network which included performances by such Hollywood luminaries as Edward G. Robinson and Rita Hayworth. \n\nArtists working in a variety of disciplines were appointed goodwill ambassadors to Latin America by the OCIAA, which also sponsored a variety of cultural tours. A select listing includes Misha Reznikoff and photojournalist Genevieve Naylor (October 1940–May 1943); Bing Crosby (August–October 1941); Walt Disney (August–October 1941); Aaron Copland (August–December 1941); George Balanchine and the American Ballet (1941); Orson Welles (1942); Rita Hayworth (1942); Grace Moore (1943); and John Ford and Gregg Toland (1943).\n\nIn its early days, a particular concern of the OCIAA was the elimination of German influence in South America, and that of other Axis powers. Trade routes to Europe were disrupted following the fall of France in June 1940, presenting opportunities to both Germany and the U.S. At the same time, many agents or affiliates of U.S. firms operating in Latin America were sympathetic to European Axis powers. The office encouraged a voluntary program of non-cooperation with companies and individuals perceived to be anti-American. To this end it cooperated secretly with British Security Coordination in New York. Though isolated in Europe, Britain maintained an extensive intelligence network in Latin America, and was happy to undermine Germany's trade efforts overseas by identifying sympathisers and agents. Through these efforts, U.S. exporters were encouraged to drop over a thousand accounts in South America during the first half of 1941.\n\nThe office was also concerned with public opinion in Latin America. It translated and disseminated relevant speeches by President Roosevelt, and distributed pro-U.S materials to features syndicates in the region. It carried out audience research surveys and encouraged radio broadcasters targeting these regions to improve the quality of their programming. In order to discourage opposing views it created a 'Proclaimed List', a black-list of newspapers and radio stations owned or influenced by Axis powers. Latin American firms wishing to do business with America were discouraged from dealing with these stations. Tax incentives were also used: spending by American firms on unprofitable longwave transmission to Latin America could be deducted from income tax payments. Likewise, spending on approved advertising in Latin America became deductible from corporate income taxes.\n\nWalt Disney and a group of animators had been sent to South America in 1941 by the U.S. State Department as part of its Good Neighbor policy, and guaranteed financing for the resulting movie, \"Saludos Amigos\". In 1944, William Benton, publisher of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", had entered into unsuccessful negotiations with Disney to make six to twelve educational films annually. Disney was asked to make an educational film about the Amazon Basin and it resulted in the 1944 animated short, \"The Amazon Awakens\".\n\nBy an Executive order of August 31, 1945, the informational activities of the Office of Inter-American Affairs were transferred to the Department of State. It became known as the Office for Inter-American Affairs. By an Executive order of April 10, 1946, the Office was abolished and its remaining functions and responsibilities were transferred to the State Department.\n\n\nThe Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs was penetrated by Soviet intelligence during World War II. The agency's code name in Soviet intelligence and in the Venona project is \"Cabaret\". These American citizens were employees of the OCIAA and engaged in espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union:\n\n\n\n\nFilms at the Internet Archive\n"}

The ancient Panathenian stadium was also refurbished as part of the works for the Olympic Games. Following some delay, on 20 January 1874, the cornerstone of the building was laid; this new building would be designed by Danish architect Theophil Hansen. Finally, on 20 October 1888, the Zappeion opened. Unfortunately for its benefactor, Evangelis Zappas, he did not live long enough to see the Zappeion built, and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas was nominated by Evangelos Zappas to complete the building. The Austrian Parliament Building was also designed by Hansen and followed the same theme in the exterior.\n\nThe Zappeion was used during the 1896 Summer Olympics as the main fencing hall. A decade later, at the 1906 Intercalated Games, it was used as the Olympic Village. It served as the first host for the organizing committee (ATHOC) for the 2004 Games from 1998 to 1999 and served as the press center during the 2004 games.

After private education he came up to Balliol College, Oxford. Here he attracted the notice of Benjamin Jowett, who became a friend.\n\nOn leaving Oxford, Morier at first obtained an appointment in the Education Department, but resigned in 1852, and in the following year became attaché at Vienna. In the succeeding years he was attached in turn to almost every court in Germany. Restless in temperament and unconventional in method, he plunged into the vortex of German politics to a degree that did not always accord with the traditions of diplomacy.\n\nThe most important years of his career in Germany were from 1866 to 1871, when he was secretary of legation at Darmstadt. Here he became a trusted adviser of the crown princess, and through her acquired an intimate friendship with the crown prince (afterwards the emperor Frederick III), whose antagonism to Bismarck's reactionary policy met with cordial support from Morier's sturdy Liberalism. Bismarck, already jealous of British influence at court, honoured Morier with a hatred not lessened by the fact that Morier's knowledge of German politics was unrivalled outside Germany. On leaving Darmstadt, Morier became \"chargé d'affaires\", first at Stuttgart, and then at Munich, and in 1876 was appointed minister at Lisbon. From 1881 to 1884 he was minister at Madrid. In December 1884 he became ambassador at St. Petersburg, and almost immediately had to face the alarming situation created by the Russian advance to Penjdeh. Thanks to his efforts, a war that at one moment seemed inevitable was averted. His great popularity at the Russian court contributed towards a marked improvement in the relations between the two countries.\n\nBismarck took alarm at the lessening influence of Germany over Russia, and tried to procure Morier's downfall. The \"Kolnische Zeitung\" declared in December 1888 that Morier had made use of his position at Darmstadt during the Franco-Prussian War to betray the movements of the German troops to Marshal Bazaine. The authority for this charge was an alleged declaration made by Bazaine to the German military attaché at Madrid. Bazaine had died in September, but Morier had heard rumours in July of the charge brought against him, and had procured from Bazaine a written denial, which he now published in \"The Times\". Apart from this, it was clearly shown that Morier could not have transmitted the information by the alleged date, and that Bazaine, according to the testimony of his own books and of other officers, received the information in question by reports from the front. As a matter of fact, Morier was an ardent champion of the German cause. His correspondence with Jowett shows the latter vainly endeavouring to convince his friend that the French were in the right. Public opinion everywhere, except in the German conservative press, attributed the charge to political motives.\n\nMorier's failing health caused him, at his own request, to be appointed Lord Dufferin's successor at Rome in 1891; but it was felt that he could not be spared from St. Petersburg, and there he remained until forced to find a milder climate. It was then too late, and he died at Montreux in Switzerland on 16 November 1893.\n\nMorier was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in October 1992 and he was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in January 1885. In February 1886 he became a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George and in September 1887 Morier was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.\n"}

{"id": "2130517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2130517", "title": "Lloret de Mar", "text": "Lloret de Mar\n\nLloret de Mar (, ; ) is a Mediterranean coastal town in Catalonia, Spain. It is south of Girona and northeast of Barcelona. With a population of 39,364 in 2009, it is the second largest town in the Selva comarca of Catalonia.\n\nLloret de Mar attracts summer visitors on package tours. Its main beach (length: 1,630 m; width: 45 m; small, gravel-like stones) is one of the most popular Costa Brava beaches, and is consistently awarded the Blue Flag for cleanliness.\n\nThe town of Lloret de Mar covers has of coastline and of forest. It borders Vidreres and Maçanet de la Selva to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the east, Tossa de Mar to the north, and Blanes to the south.\n\nLloret de Mar has a climate that is on the border between a humid subtropical climate (Köppen \"Cfa\") and a coastal Mediterranean climate (Köppen \"Csa\"), with the former very rarely seen anywhere in Southwestern Europe; temperatures are always much softer due to thermal effect moderator of the sea. Nevertheless, it should be taken into account that the Mediterranean is a warm sea all year round, which means that the characteristic moderation of temperatures is more noticeable in winter than in summer. The summer dry period normally lasts three months and the maximum rainfall occurs in the autumn months.\n\nThere are historical remains of Iberian and Roman civilisations at various archeological sites. The first written references to Lloret de Mar can be found in documents from 966 as \"Loredo\" from the Latin word \"lauretum\" (bay laurel). Like many Mediterranean coastal towns, Lloret was frequently invaded by the Saracens in the Middle Ages. It is said that the traditional \"Ball de Plaça\" (the Dance in the Town Square) dates from this era.\n\nUntil the 15th century, the town's centre was located one kilometre () inland, next to the Chapel of Les Alegries (the town's main church before the Church of Sant Romà was built) to protect itself from attacks from English, French, Turkish and Algerian pirates. Lloret's port became commercially important in the 18th century. It no longer exists but the Garriga Houses built by \"Indianos\"(Indians), rich returning Spanish immigrants to the Americas, remind us of this affluent era.The high economic level that had been achieved in certain sectors of the population of Lloret led to the demolition of the old houses and the rise of small neoclassical palaces, modernist or eclectic. The houses of the Paseo del Mar, San Pedro Street and the Plaza de España.In the first decade of the twentieth century, the first holiday makers arrived in Lloret. In 1918 the first summer villas began to be built, such as the Indian house of Emilio Heydrich 1921, the first hotel was opened in 192, the hotel \"Costa Brava\" . But the Spanish Civil War and the postwar period brought economic restrictions and difficulties and stopped the incipient tourist activity of Lloret. All in all, the first vacationers who came from the Barcelona area soon arrived and were generally well-placed textile manufacturers or similar occupants.\n\n\nLloret de Mar has been awarded the Blue Flag seal of quality for Lloret, Fenals, Sa Boadella and Santa Cristina beaches.\n\n\nSanta Clotilde Gardens, designed at the turn of the 20th century in the noucentisme style, are probably the finest example of contemporary Catalan landscape gardening. In 1919, Doctor Raül Roviralta i Astoul, Marquis of Roviralta, commissioned the architect and noucentista landscaper Nicolau Maria Rubió i Tudurí to build the house and gardens of Santa Clotilde, overlooking Sa Boadella cove. Set on a clifftop with stunning sea views, the gardens are characterised by their wide variety of plants in contrast to an absence of flowers.\n\nIn order to balance the exploitation of resources with the existing fishing capacity and the maintenance of marine ecosystems, on the initiative of various fishermen's guilds and the Directorate General for Sea Fishing, in recent years a series of artificial reefs have been installed in various places in Catalonia and in 1994 the biotope was created in Lloret de Mar. The artificial reef covers 150 hectares and stretches from \"Punta des Bullents\" (Cala Canyelles) to \"Racó des Bernat\" (Lloret de Mar), with a bathymetric range of between 15 and 25 metres. The reef is composed of four series of protective modules placed perpendicular to the coastline and forty beehive-shaped production structures placed facing Canyelles beach. The initial goal of the Lloret de Mar biotope was to increase the biological productivity of the system, to revive and develop artisan fishing, and to protect the Posidonia Oceanica meadows.\n\nThe Maritime Museum, which focuses on the history of the \"Indianos\" and Lloret de Mar's seafaring and fishing past, is housed in Casa Garriga, an old Indiano house that was acquired by the town council in 1981 in order to turn it into a local museum. It is divided into five areas: Sons of the sea, Mediterranean, Gateway to the ocean, Lloret after sailing ships, and Beyond the beach. The route through the museum takes in everything from coastal trading in the Mediterranean to high-sea sailing across the Atlantic.\n\nSituated at the top of the hill that separates Lloret de Mar and Fenals beaches, it dates back to the turn of the 11th century. The castle served as a watchtower to warn of possible attacks from the sea. The origins of the Castle of Sant Joan are the origins of the town of Lloret. Back in the 11th century, the area of land delimited as Loredo was ruled over by Sicardis of Lloret (1031-1103). According to the terms of Sicardis' will, the feudal land was to be shared between two of her sons: Bernat Umbert, Bishop of Girona, and Bernat Gaufred, a secular lord who became Lord of Palafolls. This shared jurisdiction lasted until 1218, when Bishop Bernat Umbert died and his fief passed exclusively to the See of the Chapter of Girona Cathedral. In 1790, the \"Comú\" (Town Council) and the inhabitants of Lloret asked the Royal Council of the Treasury (\"\"Real Consejo de Hacienda\"\") to make the castle and its land royal property in exchange for the payment of 8,000 pounds to the Cathedral Chapter for its loss of ownership rights. The legal dispute, which lasted until 1802, was decided in favour of Lloret's inhabitants, bringing almost eight centuries of feudal rule to an end, although the Castle of Sant Joan belonged to the Chapter until 1807. The Third Coalition War that pitted Great Britain against Spain and France, and which concluded at the Battle of Trafalgar, had disastrous consequences for the tower of the Castle of Sant Joan. In 1805 the British Navy bombed the tower, destroying the fortified enclosure once and for all. The castle remained in disuse throughout the 19th century and was reduced to ruins. The restoration of the keep, which is now open to visitors, was completed in 1992. Meanwhile, the excavations and the museological project were completed between 2000 and 2001.\n\nThe modernist cemetery of Lloret de Mar is one of the most important Indiano cemeteries in Catalonia and one of the most representative anywhere in Spain. The essence of Lloret de Mar cemetery can be traced to the arrival of the newly rich Indianos, those who returned to the town after making their fortune in the Americas. Designed by Joaquim Artau i Fàbregas, the main avenue contains a series of dazzling pantheons and hypogea in a highly evocative modernist style.\n\nBonaventura Conill i Montobbio, a disciple of Gaudí, was one of the cemetery's most prolific architects, producing high crosses, dragons that watch over the darkness and death, and angels with heads bowed who mourn like any mortal.\n\nThe Indianos were families with many good connections, which explains the presence of works by architects such as Puig i Cadafalch and Ismael Smith i Marí, who designed the pale marble female figure that symbolises death and that rests surrounded by red roses. At the end of the central avenue there is a chapel around which the second category hypogea are arranged. There are rows of avenues lined with very similar and highly decorative pantheons, all joined together, some adorned with fresh flowers and others left bare.\n\nWork on the new cemetery began in 1896 and its construction was completed in 1901. Relatively unknown, it offers a wide perspective on the funerary art of the period. The completed basic structure of the cemetery was impressive for a town with fewer than 4000 inhabitants. Once it was officially opened the leading architects and sculptors of the time contributed works. Joaquim Artau i Fàbregas drew up the original plans and once the cemetery opened the architects Antoni Maria Gallissà and Josep Puig i Cadafalch were the first to execute projects for the new necropolis. Another architect, Vicenç Artigas i Albertí, soon became involved and over the course of 1903 Bonaventura Conill i Montobbio, a disciple of Gaudí, joined the group. Both of these architects continued to work for the cemetery on a regular basis and most of the works that make up the complex constituted an important part of their output. In 1905 Ramon Maria Riudor joined the list of contributors. This architect, who worked on and off in Lloret de Mar, designed a pantheon for the cemetery. The cemetery of Lloret de Mar is possibly one of the most important examples of Catalan funerary art of the modernist period. Although it is a rather small complex, it contains a good number of works capable of reviving the debate over modernist art and the modernists.\n\nArchitects such as Enric Monserdà, Bonaventura Conill and Puig i Cadafalch built modernist buildings including the Sanctuary of Sant Pere del Bosc with the small chapel of Mare de Déu de Gràcia (Our Lady of Grace), or the chapel of the Baptistery and the chapel of the Santíssim Sagrament (Holiest Sacrament), both of which belong to the church of Sant Romà, and, last of all, the pantheon of the Costa Macià family, one of the most complex and sumptuous modernist structures in Lloret de Mar cemetery.\n\nThere are three Iberian settlements in Lloret de Mar: Montbarbat, Puig de Castellet and Turó Rodó, dating from as far back as the 4th century BC (Montbarbat) to as late as the 2nd century BC (Turó Rodó). By the time of the 1st century BC, the Iberian world had been swept away due to the expansion of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe Iberians, who were the indigenous inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula, were organised into territorial tribes: Laietani, Cessetani, Ilercavones, Ilergetes, Ausetani and Indigetes. The Indigetes inhabited the Puig de Castellet settlement. This settlement, dating from the 3rd century BC, is situated two kilometres away from Lloret de Mar town centre in a strategic spot with an excellent vantage point overlooking the area stretching from the Tordera estuary to the Lloret coast. It is a small 650 m enclosure composed of around six dwellings. The settlement was fortified with a thick wall and defence towers during a turbulent period of history that shook the Mediterranean region from 264 BC to 146 BC: the Punic Wars. The strengthening of the enclosure wall dates back to the 3rd century BC, coinciding with the period of Carthaginian rule. As such, this settlement was active for around 50 years between 250 BC and 200 BC, at which point it was abandoned.\n\nThe excavations have been carried out in various stages: the first from 1968 to 1969, the second from 1970 to 1972 and the third and final stage from 1975 to 1986. During the excavations a large amount of archaeological material was unearthed, mostly locally produced ceramics but also Attic ceramics imported from different places, including Italy, Greece and Rhode (Roses). The Puig de Castellet settlement has been incorporated in the \"\"Route of the Iberians\"\", created by the Archaeology Museum of Catalonia and for which Lloret de Mar Town Council has carried out the necessary site adaptation.\n\n\nEs Tint is a small property where Lloret's fishermen went until the 1960s to dye their nets, using a liquid produced by boiling water and pine bark. This was when nets were made of hemp, esparto and, later on, cotton. The nets were dyed by means of an ancient technique used throughout the Mediterranean, which consisted of soaking the nets in the liquid previously boiled in the cauldron until they were well impregnated. They were then wrung and put out to dry on the beach. The dye served both to increase the durability of the nets and to camouflage them in the sea.\n\nThe emergence of nylon nets signalled the end of this small industry, which depended on the Fishermen's Guild, and the building fell into disuse.\n\nIn the past, every coastal town had premises of this kind for dyeing nets, normally run by the local guild. Not many survive today; on the Costa Brava only the \"Sa Perola\" building in Calella de Palafrugell and \"Es Tint\" in Lloret de Mar remain.\n\nTwo sections of the GR92 Mediterranean footpath pass through Lloret:\n\n\nThe Lloret de Mar - Fenals coastal footpath is a trail which hugs the Lloret coastline from Lloret beach to Fenals beach. It begins at the end of the Lloret's seafront promenade, passing by the \"Es Racó de Garbí\" spot and the little cove of \"Sa Caravera\". Some steps then lead up to a path that winds its way around a rocky coastline. It then passes by the \"Es salt des Burros\" spot before leading on to the Dona Marinera (Seafarer's Wife) statue by the sculptor Ernest Maragall i Noble. Another set of steps then lead down to Cala Banys, a rocky cove with several reefs. The footpath crosses a pine grove, emerging at Fenals point, where the mediaeval Castle of Sant Joan is located. Following the path from the watchtower, some steps lead down to \"Plaça Sisquella\", located at the start of the Fenals seafront promenade.\n\nSince February 2012, Lloret de Mar has been promoting its annual carnival in conjunction with Blanes and Tossa de Mar under the Costa Brava South Carnival brand, an initiative aimed at encouraging visitors to enjoy and take part in the parades of the three towns. In Lloret the main event is the Great Parade of the Carnestoltes (Carnival King).\n\nThe Rally Costa Brava is the oldest event of its kind in Spain and since it was first held in 1953 Lloret de Mar has always been at the epicentre of the competition. In 1988 the two most important rallies in Catalonia, the Rally Costa Brava and the Rally Catalunya, were merged to form the Rally Catalunya – Costa Brava, taking as a reference the 24 Rally Catalunya competitions held rather than the 35 previous Rally Costa Brava competitions. In parallel, the 10 x Hora motor sports association continued to organise its own rally, initially the Costa Brava – Lloret Rally (1988), and then the Rally Lloret – Costa Brava (1989–1994). In 1991, the Rally Catalunya – Costa Brava became a point-scoring world championship event, a situation that lasted until 2004. The Lloret de Mar Town Council immediately set about ensuring that this important association with motor sports was not lost, and since then has hosted the Rally Costa Brava and the Rally Costa Brava Històric every year. Both rallies, very well attended by participants and spectators alike, recover the essence of the original Rally Costa Brava competitions, offering spectators the chance to see legendary drivers and co-drivers up close.\n\nThe Mediterranean International Cup, held in April, is an international youth football tournament for promising young players. It is held in various locations in the province of Girona, although Lloret de Mar is the epicentre of the event and is where all the participants stay. Some of the world's leading clubs take part in this international tournament, including Barcelona, Real Madrid or Valencia, among others. Lionel Messi, Neymar, Jordi Alba and Gerard Piqué of Barcelona; Juan Mata of Manchester United; Cesc Fàbregas of Chelsea); Lucas of Liverpool; and Marcelo of Real Madrid are just some of the players who have taken part in the MIC and who now play for the world's leading clubs, which makes this a key event for scouts.\n\nLloret de Mar has always been an important accommodation base for Formula 1 enthusiasts who travel to Catalonia to see the F1 Grand Prix at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. In 2012, the destination created a special themed event to tie in with the F1 Grand Prix: the Lloret Formula Weekend, a weekend in May packed with activities. Visitors can experience what it is like to drive a Ferrari, take part in a F1 simulator competition and see an exciting parade of authentic single-seater race cars through the streets of Lloret. There is also a car show with official products of top makes on sale, live music in the streets and nightlife in Lloret's top discothèques and in the Gran Casino Costa Brava.\n\nLloret Night Shopping is a shopping, fashion and eating-out event held in May and September, in which shops remain open until the small hours. The event also includes live music, fashion parades, performances and options for eating out.\n\nThis event takes place in May and the main ingredient is rice, which is combined with local products from the sea or mountains, with a variety of culinary offerings ranging from the most traditional to the most innovative.\n\nLloret de Mar has an important seafaring past, especially at the turn of the 20th century. Those who emigrated from Lloret to America to seek their fortune were known in the town as Americanos and as Indianos in the rest of Catalonia. For one weekend in June the town travels back to this Indiano period and the streets are filled with all sorts of activities, such as street theatre, demonstrations of traditional trades, craft markets and guided tours, among others.\n\nThe now-traditional Beaches Fun Walk takes place on the last Sunday in September and is organised by the Xino-Xano cultural association. Participants in ths fun walk gather at the meeting point in Plaça de la Vila first thing in the morning and then travel by cruise boat or coach to Cala Canyelles, where the walk begins. This is mostly a coastal route, winding its way along a coastal footpath that offers views from the cliffs as it passes by Cala Trons, Sa Caleta, Lloret's main beach, Fenals beach and Sa Boadella, ending up at Santa Cristina beach.\n\nThese fish and seafood gastronomy days recall Lloret de Mar's seafaring past and its close association with the sea. The name refers to the ancient fishing technique known as tirada a l'art that was carried out on the beach of Cala Canyelles in Lloret. 25 restaurants and hotels from the town take part in this October event.\n\nIn addition to the Rally Costa Brava, since 2003 Lloret de Mar has been hosting the Rally Costa Brava Històric, which has become one of the world's leading vintage car rallies. This competition recovers the essence of great competitions, offering spectators the chance to see legendary drivers and co-drivers up close.\nMeanwhile, with the idea of also hosting a speed rally for vintage cars, in 2005 the Rally Costa Brava was revived, which in essence is a continuation of the oldest rally in Spain. This rally is a point-scoring event in various national and international categories and is viewed by the FIA (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile) as one of the most prestigious on the continent.\n\nThe Medieval Fair is held as part of the festivities of Sant Romà, patron saint of Lloret de Mar. The town travels back to the Middle Ages with themed stalls and a wide variety of activities: troubadours, music, magic shows, the caravan of donkeys, medieval huts, workshops, an exhibition of medieval torture implements, calligraphy, demonstrations of artisan trades, games and a play centre for children. Held in November.\n\nTirada a l’art is perhaps one of the most deeply rooted traditions in the town of Lloret de Mar. This activity is held on Lloret's main beach in February and December and is a way of remembering and paying tribute to the fishing technique through which many of the town's inhabitants earned a living many years ago. It consists of casting the net into the water at daybreak and then hauling it back to the shore and onto the beach, gathering up all the fish that it has dragged in.\n\nThe origin of the non-EU immigrants, unlike neighbouring municipalities, broadly tends to be North African or Latin American (employee employed in construction or services) and Asian (self employed: trade).\n\nThe increase in population began to be noticed in the 1990s but it was with the entry of the 21st century when the demographics of the town began to grow uncontrollably due mainly to the influx of non-EU immigrants. Currently they constitute 40% of the total population.\n\nIn 1987, 27% of the total tourism establishment offering of the Costa Brava was concentrated in Lloret de Mar, but with 49% of the total hotel beds offering:\n\nEvery year, Lloret welcomes 12% of the tourists who visit Catalonia and over 40% of the tourists who visit the Costa Brava. Lloret de Mar is ranked the fifth largest sun and sand destination in Spain and the largest in Catalonia in terms of the number of hotel beds. 50% of its hotel accommodation offering is concentrated in hotels with three stars or more and, while 64% of the five-star and luxury hotel accommodation on the Costa Brava is located in the town. Lloret de Mar's hotel offering in 2013 consisted of 30,000 hotel beds and over 120 establishments, of which 13,000 beds were in three-star hotels and 11,000 in four and five-star hotels.\n\nLloret de Mar boasts over 120 hotel establishments with approximately 30,000 hotel beds. The average stay is 5 days and the average occupancy rate is 60%\n\nThe sports tourism destination (Destinació de Turisme Esportiu - DTE) certificate is a specialist seal awarded by the Catalan Tourism Agency (\"Agència Catalana de Turisme - ACT\") with the goal of promoting tourism destinations equipped for various kinds of sports and which stand out for their offering of high quality resources and services for elite, professional and amateur sports people, along with tourists keen on sports activities. Lloret de Mar has been certified as a Sports Destination since 2006 thanks to a high quality and multidisciplinary sports offering concentrated in a single sports area in the town centre, surrounded by the hotel and shopping area and just 800 metres from the beach.\n\nIn 2010 the destination received the Family Tourism Destination seal of the Government of Catalonia.\n\nLloret de Mar has redefined itself in recent years as an urban beach tourist destination. \"Urban beach\" is a new coastal destination concept in which the natural attractions of sun and sand are complemented by a series of added values related to the area, such as its history, inhabitants, traditions, customs, cultural heritage and a wide-ranging offering in terms of leisure, tourism and services.\n\nLloret de Mar drew up its first Strategic Tourism Plan in 2010, a plan that brought together a decade of work focused on joint initiatives between the public authorities and the private sector, which began in 2003 with the creation of the Lloret Turisme tourism promotion body. The plan is currently at the implementation stage with two key objectives: on the one hand, to opt for one of the Tourist Destination Reconversion Plans promoted by the Spanish government in partnership with the Government of Catalonia, designed to achieve the reconversion and comprehensive modernisation of mature destinations of international standing and potential; and, on the other hand, to consolidate its strategic products (urban beach, sports tourism and business tourism) as a strategy for reducing the seasonal nature of tourism. The first objective was achieved in March 2014 with the signing of the Pilot Plan Agreement for Lloret with the Government of Catalonia.\n\nThe markedly seasonal nature of tourism is a key feature of the town's shopping infrastructure. In 1983 there were 306 permanent retail outlets and 272 seasonal retail outlets. Lloret has the second highest number of retail outlets on the Costa Brava, ranked only below Figueres, a non-coastal town.\n\nLloret de Mar currently boasts (2014) 1000 retail outlets, of which 500 are concentrated in the town's old quarter. Moreover, since 2010 the shops in Lloret de Mar have been authorised to open every day of the year, including public holidays. Commercial fairs and activities are held throughout the year, such as the Lloret Night Shopping event, the Botiga al career festival (where local shops sell their wares in outdoor stalls) or the Mediaeval Fair, among others. The weekly street market held every Tuesday and the daily Municipal Market are also recommended.\n\nLloret de Mar can be reached along two coastal roads (passing through Tossa de Mar from the north and through Blanes from the south) and one inland road (passing through Vidreres). There is very heavy traffic on all three roads, especially in the summer. The inland road is the main connection to the rest of Spain and abroad, since it links up with the National II road, to the AP-7 motorway and to Girona-Costa Brava airport. Meanwhile, the coastal roads constitute the main routes to Barcelona ( away) and to the French border (approximately away). From the south, the C-32 coastal motorway connects Barcelona to Lloret (exit 134) as far as Blanes; the final are along the GI-600 road heading to Blanes and the GI-682 road heading to Lloret de Mar. Coming from the north (France) on the AP-7 motorway, exit 9 (Lloret de Mar) must be taken. The final are along the C-63 road. Coming from the north-east, there are from Tossa to Lloret along the GI-682 road.\n\nLloret de Mar offers scheduled and chartered coach services to Barcelona, Girona and major European cities, with vehicles adapted for persons of reduced mobility. Lloret has an international bus station and private stations that cater for international coaches.\n\nThe urban bus network connects all the town's districts and tourism areas.\n\nThere are four taxi ranks in Lloret with over 40 taxis that operate around the clock, all year round. Four-seater and seven-seater vehicles are available, along with vehicles for persons of reduced mobility. Taxis are white and display a taxi sign.\n\nThere is no direct train service in Lloret de Mar; the nearest railway station is in Blanes, which since March 2014 connects southwards to Barcelona and northwards as far as Portbou on the commuter network. The Pujol bus company runs a shuttle service from Lloret bus station to Blanes railway station every 30 minutes. Trains heading to Barcelona leave every 30 minutes and the journey takes 80 minutes.\n\nCanyelles marina is the only marina in Lloret de Mar. It is located at Canyelles beach and is suitable for medium-sized vessels.\n\nLloret de Mar offers tourism cruise services that connect to the neighbouring towns of Blanes, Tossa de Mar and Sant Feliu de Guíxols during the summer season.\n\nThe closest airports are Barcelona airport away, and Girona airport . Barcelona airport offers scheduled flights to the world's major cities. Thanks to the low-cost airlines that operate in Girona airport, Lloret de Mar is connected to a large number of European cities. The airport also enjoys a high volume of charter flight traffic. Finally, Perpignan airport is 90 minutes away by car.\n\n\nRichard Shannon (1979)\nChief of advertising and tourism\n\nThe city has a roller hockey team CH Lloret, one of the most important in Catalonia, and dispute the main League OK Liga.\n\n\n"}

Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada. He was born in 1945 into an aristocratic Bengali family and spent the rest of his early childhood in urban Kolkata. Leaving India in 1970 for his further education, he attended university in Germany. There, he searched out the ancient Vedic scriptures and instantly became driven to explore the depths of spirituality, discovering the richness of India’s spiritual heritage.\n\nBecoming engrossed in the depths of a book which he obtained called “The Nectar of Devotion” written by Srila Prabhupada, he realized that he had found his spiritual master and the path for which he was searching. Bhakti Charu Swami joined the International Society for Krishna Consciousness(ISKCON) in Mayapur, West Bengal, India. His first meeting with Srila Prabhupada finally took place in January 1977 during the Maha Kumbha Mela at Prayagraj. On his first meeting only, Srila Prabhupada gave him the following instructions: to translate all of his books into Bengali and become his Secretary for Indian Affairs. He was given first and second initiation in Sridham Mayapur during the Gaura Purnima festival in March 1977. Shortly after, during the Snana Yatra festival in Vrindavan, Srila Prabhupada awarded him the renounced order of sannyasa. He later then served as the GBC (Governing Body Commissioner) Chairman in 1989 and later in 2017. Maharaja continued to translate many of Srila Prabhupada’s books into Bengali to its completion in 1996, which is the centennial anniversary of Srila Prabhupada’s appearance.\n\nThereafter, he was involved in creating, writing, producing and directing the epic biographical and well known video series, Abhay Charan. With over 100 episodes and broadcast on Indian National Television, reaching more than 4 million viewers in a short span of few months, the series beautiful and chronologically portrays Srila Prabhupada’s whole life and achievements.\n\nHe further went on to develop the ISKCON project in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, India. This is the place where Lord Sri Krishna, along with His brother Balarama and friend Sudama received Their education from Maharishi Sandipani. Under Maharaj’s leadership there, an extraordinary marble temple was inaugurated in less than 10 months in February 2006. As a resident GBC of that area, he continues to oversee the development of the project and the preaching programs in Madhya Pradesh and surrounding areas.\n\nThe Ujjain ISKCON temple under the direction of Bhakti Charu Swami feeds more than 23,000 school children per day. To facilitate this feeding project, Bhakti Charu Swami built a 6,000 sq. ft. (560 m2) industrial kitchen. He was the Chairman of Annamrita Foundation, ISKCON’s midday meals programme, which feeds 1.7 million children across India.\n\nHe has also established a department in Ujjain which produces exquisitely decorated altars, murtis and deity dresses for devotees and ISKCON temples all over the world.\n\nIn 2013, he pioneered the development of a new ISKCON temple in Panihati (West Bengal) – a very holy place in the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, the home of Raghava Pandit and the place of Lord Nityananda’s Chipped Rice (Chida Dahi) Festival.\n\nIn 2014, he established Arogya Niketan, a traditional and authentic Ayurvedic health clinic in Ujjain.\n\nIn the same year, he joined Artha Forum and began delivering keynote speeches globally on spirituality to large audiences of business leaders. Bhakti Charu Swami has on many occasions displayed his mastery and expertise in the field of management and leadership, community building, and strengthening relationships. He has delivered presentations as a keynote speaker at top management and engineering institutes of the world (MIT Boston, IIM's and IITs).\n\nHe has founded and established I-Foundation, a leading Hindu charity organisation in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2016, Bhakti Charu Swami launched a beautiful memoir, “Ocean of Mercy – A Search Fulfilled”, where he recollects his intimate interactions with Srila Prabhupada. This book describes how he developed a genuine love and dedication for Srila Prabhupada who gave him a life of Krishna Bhakti, and thus revealed to him, to be truly an “ocean of mercy.”\n\nOn,17 November 2016, Institute of International Social Development –New York, an NGO in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations awarded an accolade to Bhakti Charu Swami, as a display of their gratitude for all the support he gave them on behalf of ISKCON, in spreading the message of spirituality for the World Peace and Understanding between Nations and Civilizations.\n\nHe has recently started a new project called ‘Veda Foundation and Cow Sanctuary’ which is situated in Deland, Florida and stretches 120 acres. His mission there is to propagate the Vedic culture and wisdom more simply in the West through setting in motion farm communities and visual media.\n\nHe carries the following responsibilities in his preaching of God consciousness around the world.\n\n\nHis Vision & Mission:\n\n\"\"Those 2 months have turned into forty years, but they have flown by, and by Srila Prabhupada's causeless mercy, my life has found its perfection. My realization is that I am an eternal part and parcel of Krishna and that my life's goal is to develop my loving relationship with Him is all due to the mercy of Srila Prabhupada, who took me by the hand and led me to that relationship. I know that I have found the true path to perfection, and that achieving success is only a matter of continuously moving forward without deviation. – “Ocean Of Mercy”.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Zeth Höglund went on many meetings in Bolshevik Russia and was elected to the Comintern Executive Committee in 1922. In 1926, he returned to the Social Democratic party but still chose to define himself as a communist.\n\nZeth Höglund grew up in Gothenburg in a lower-middle-class family. His father, Carl Höglund, worked as a merchant in leather and later became a shoemaker. Zeth was the youngest of ten children. He was also the only son, and hence had nine big sisters.\n\nHis parents were very religious but disliked the church hierarchy and the way preachers and governments used religion to influence people. Höglund would later become an atheist.\n\nEarly on in high school, Höglund started considering himself a socialist and instead of his school books he started reading the German socialists Karl Marx, Ferdinand Lassalle, Wilhelm Liebknecht and the Swedish socialists Axel Danielsson and Hjalmar Branting. He also read Nietzsche and August Strindberg.\n\nHe graduated from high school in 1902 with average grades. He soon got an internship with the liberal daily Göteborgs-Posten and was hired by that newspaper that fall.\n\nThe same fall Höglund started studying \"History\", \"Political Science\" and \"Literature\" at the Gothenburg University. Here he met Fredrik Ström, a four-year-older student, also a radical socialist. They developed a close friendship that would last their whole lives.\n\nAt the May Day demonstration in 1903, Höglund and Fredrik Ström had an invitation to speak from the Social Democratic Party on a demand for 8-hour workdays. Höglund started and was followed by Ström, who suddenly started agitating for 6-hour workdays, and even promising 4-hour workdays in a socialist future.\n\nIn the summer of 1903, Höglund and Fredrik Ström decided to move to Paris. They were curious of the homeland of the great French Revolution of 1789 and the city where their heroes Jean-Paul Marat, Georges Danton and Louis de Saint-Just had lived and fought.\n\nIn Paris they attended several socialist meetings, of which the grandest was when Jean Jaurès spoke to over 4,000 people. They tried to write on their own and sent political articles home to Sweden where some of them were published in different newspapers. One day at the post office, Fredrik Ström discovered that they were under surveillance by the French police.\n\nThe two Swedes were very short on money. They had to live modestly in Paris and could spend little money on food. When winter came they froze and went hungry. They had hoped to stay much longer, but decided to go back to Sweden. They had no funds for the trip home, but two of Höglund's sisters, Ada and Alice, sent them the money, and they returned home by Christmas 1903.\n\nHöglund joined the Swedish Social Democratic Party in 1904 and became the leader of party's youth movement. He wrote an article called \"Let Us Make Swedish Social Democracy the Strongest in the World\".\n\nIn 1905, Höglund strongly supported Norway's right to self-determination and independence from Sweden. When the Swedish conservatives made clear that they were prepared to subdue Norway by force, Zeth Höglund wrote the manifesto \"Down With Weapons!\" (\"Ned med vapnen!\") in which he indirectly declared that if the Swedish workers were forced to go to war with Norway, they would instead turn their weapons against the Swedish ruling class. The war was avoided, and Norway became independent, but, as a result of his anti-war agitation, Zeth Höglund was sentenced to six months in jail, which he served between the mid-summer and Christmas of 1906.\n\nWhile condemned and imprisoned by the Swedish ruling class as a dangerous rebel, Höglund was saluted by others. The German socialist Karl Liebknecht described him as a hero in his book \"Militarism and Anti-Militarism\". The Russian Communist leader Lenin wrote: \"The close alliance between the Norwegian and Swedish workers, their complete fraternal class solidarity, gained from the Swedish workers' recognition of the right of the Norwegians to secede... The Swedish workers have proved that in spite of all the vicissitudes of bourgeois policy... they will be able to preserve and defend the complete equality and class solidarity of the workers of both nations in the struggle against both the Swedish and the Norwegian bourgeoisie.\" (\"The Right of Nations to Self-Determination\") \n\nIn November 1912, Höglund, together with his Swedish friends Hjalmar Branting and Ture Nerman, attended the special emergency convention of the Socialist International, which had been summoned to Basel in Switzerland, due to the outbreak of the Balkan Wars. At the convention, the leaders of all the European Socialist parties agreed to stand together internationally to prevent any future wars.\n\nTogether with Fredrik Ström and Hannes Sköld, Höglund wrote the anti-militarist manifesto \"Det befästa fattighuset\" (The Fortress Poorhouse) in which they described and criticized Sweden as an armed fortress and at the same time a poorhouse, where the people were miserable and the rulers spent all resources on militarism. \"Not one krona, not one öre, to militarism!\" was the slogan of the manifesto. It was despised from the bourgeoisie politicians and media.\n\nIn 1914, Höglund got a seat in the lower house of the Riksdag. There, he agitated for socialism, against capitalism, war and the Swedish monarchy. Höglund's speeches were so revolutionary that they even provoked Hjalmar Branting, although many young socialists started seeing Höglund as their true leader.\n\nIn 1914, when World War I broke out, Zeth Höglund together with Ture Nerman represented the Swedish-Norwegian members of the Zimmerwald Conference, the international socialist anti-war movement which gathered in the small Swiss village of Zimmerwald. There the young Swedish socialist met Vladimir Lenin, Grigory Zinoviev, Karl Radek and Leon Trotsky: Zeth Höglund and Ture Nerman felt very close to the Russian Bolsheviks.\n\nBack in Bern, after the conference in Zimmerwald, Zeth Höglund had a beer with Lenin in a local pub. Lenin asked Höglund if the \"Swedish Socialist Youth Organization\" possibly could donate some much needed money to the Bolsheviks. Höglund offered Lenin some money, and although it was a small amount, Lenin was extremely joyful and grateful. Höglund realized afterwards that maybe it was more about political trust than money.\n\nEven though Sweden did not participate in the war, Höglund's anti-war propaganda was enough to send Höglund to jail again for \"betrayal of the Kingdom.\" While Höglund was at Långholmen prison, in Stockholm, his wife gave birth to their second daughter.\n\nIn April 1917, Lenin and other communists passed through Stockholm from the exile in Switzerland on their return trip to Russia after the February Revolution. Lenin, who was greeted in Sweden by Otto Grimlund, Ture Nerman, Fredrik Ström and Carl Lindhagen, wanted to go and visit Höglund in jail. Arrangements were made, but, due other meetings running over time and the Bolsheviks hurry to get back to Russia, Lenin's visit to Långholmen had to be cancelled. However, the Bolshevik leader sent a telegram to Höglund wishing him strength and hoping to see him soon again, signed Lenin and Ström.\n\nZeth Höglund, prisoner number 172, was released from Långholmen prison on 6 May 1917 after more than 13 months in prison. He was greeted by his friends, family and a couple of thousands workers who had gathered outside the prison. On the same day of his release, Höglund held a speech in a park in Stockholm, massing thousands of people to hear him talk about peace, socialism and revolution.\n\nFrom Russia came a telegram: \"On the day of your release from prison, the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. greets in your person a staunch fighter against the imperialist war and a wholehearted supporter of the Third International.\" signed by Lenin and Zinoviev. \n\nHöglund was a radical, revolutionary socialist and was the main leader of the Left Opposition in the Social Democratic Party, against the reformist politics of the party leader Hjalmar Branting. In 1917, Zeth Höglund and the left-wing were expelled from the party but they regrouped as the \"Swedish Social Democratic Left Party\", which supported the Bolsheviks in Russia and worked for the aim of a communist revolution in Sweden. This new party would soon become the (original) Communist Party of Sweden (SKP) and still exists today as the Left Party.\n\nIn 1916, the left socialists launched their own newspaper, \"Politiken\", in which they wrote and published many texts by Lenin, Zinoviev, Bukharin and Karl Radek. Both Radek and Bukharin, who spent a lot of time in the neutral Sweden during the World War, had a great influence on the development of the Swedish Socialist Left.\n\nIn December 1917, Höglund and Karl Kilbom traveled to Petrograd to visit the Bolsheviks and show their support of the revolution. On their day of arrival, Höglund was invited to see Lenin in the Smolny. Lenin was in an excellent mood. The Swedish communists were one of the first international groups to visit Soviet Russia and, by New Year's Eve, the Swedish delegation was joined by Otto Grimlund and Carl Lindhagen.\n\nHöglund and Lindhagen were invited to speak to an audience of 10,000 people in Petrograd. The Bolshevik Alexandra Kollontay, who had spent a lot of time in Scandinavia and had become a close friend of the Swedish left socialists, translated the speeches of Lindhagen and Höglund from Swedish to Russian.\n\nHöglund stayed until spring of 1918 in Soviet Russia. He traveled around the country and worked closely with the Bolshevik leaders. He was even offered to be made an honorable corporal in the Red Army, but he declined. (The position was then offered to the Norwegian Communist Olav Scheflo.) Höglund wrote long texts for \"Politiken\" and managed to keep a great influence over the communist movement in Sweden from abroad.\n\nOn his way back to Sweden, Höglund also visited the Reds in Finland, which at the time was in the throes of the Finnish civil war, which soon ended in White victory.\n\nIn March 1919, the founding congress of the Communist International (Comintern) took place in Russia, with Otto Grimlund representing the Swedish Socialist Left. Zeth Höglund worked hard to convince his friends that the Swedish Party should join the Comintern.\n\nDuring the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern, which took place in Russia the summer of 1920, Zinoviev said, \"Unfortunately Comrade Höglund and others who took part along with us in the founding of the Communist International are not here.\" Instead, Kata Dalström represented the Swedish communists.\n\nBut in the summer of 1921, Zeth Höglund, together with Fredrik Ström and Hinke Bergegren, represented Sweden in the third congress of the Comintern held in Moscow, and Höglund worked hard to make the Swedish party accept the Twenty-one Conditions for membership in the Communist International, including changing the name from \"Sweden's Social Democratic Left Party\" to the \"Swedish Communist Party\". Some of the party's members who did not agree to the 21 theses left the party while others, including Carl Lindhagen, were expelled.\n\nHöglund was elected to the Comintern Executive Committee in 1922. However, in 1924, over disagreement concerning the development of Comintern policies, thinking there was too much direct control from Moscow, Höglund split from Swedish Communist Party and founded his own Communist Party. In 1926 he rejoined the Swedish Social Democratic Party, where he was part of the radical left. He still considered himself a Communist until the day he died in 1956, always defending the original ideas of Lenin.\n\nZeth Höglund was the Mayor of Stockholm from 1940 to 1950.\n\nZeth Höglund had a street named after him in Leningrad, now Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n"}

The chart lists the top songs that have not yet charted on the main \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Chart rankings are based on radio airplay, sales, and streams. In its initial years, the chart listed 15 positions, but expanded to as many as 36 during the 1960s, particularly during years when over 700 singles made the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. From 1974 to 1985, the chart consisted of 10 positions; since 1992, the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart has listed 25 positions.\n\nThe Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart was first introduced in the June 1, 1959 issue of \"Billboard\", under the name \"Bubbling Under the Hot 100\". Containing a listing of 15 singles, the chart was described as \"the new listing that predicts which new records will become chart climbers.\" Its first number-one single was \"A Prayer and a Juke Box\" by Little Anthony and the Imperials. It would continue to be published in issues of \"Billboard\" until August 24, 1985, after which it was discontinued. Prior to its discontinuation, the chart had not been issued in four issues; three from 1974 and one in 1978. However, it returned as a feature in the December 5, 1992, issue of \"Billboard\" and continues to the present day.\n\nFrom June 1959 through August 1985, \"Billboard\" compiled the chart based on playlists reported by radio station and retail sales outlets surveys. In 1992, \"Billboard\" employed updated data capture technology in compiling the chart, using point-of-sale retail information provided by Nielsen SoundScan, input from radio station airplay monitoring provided by Broadcast Data Systems and playlists from small-market systems.\n\nThe chart's first issue mentions that a rank position indicates \"relative potential to earn an early listing on the Hot 100\" and records were ranked starting with #1. From August 28, 1961, to August 24, 1985, the chart positions were numbered starting with number 101. Songs that have already appeared on the Hot 100 are not included in the Bubbling Under chart as they exit the charts, but may re-enter the Bubbling Under chart at a later date.\n\nOver the years, the chart would undergo several changes and alterations. In the 1960s, the chart included as many as 35 slots; on two rare occasions in 1963 and 1968, the chart contained 36 slots. By the 1980s, the chart contained only 10 slots.\n\nOn the first issue of its 1992 revival, the chart was renamed to \"Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles\" from its previous name, \"Bubbling Under the Hot 100\". The same issue increased the total number of slots on the chart to 25 and the chart numbering began with #1.\n\nSeveral reference books on the history of the \"Billboard\" \"Bubbling Under\" charts have been published by chart statistician Joel Whitburn's company Record Research. The latest book to be published by the company was 2005's \"Bubbling Under the Billboard Hot 100: 1959-2004\" ().

It was released in early 1999 on Columbia Records, following the band's move from American Recordings, after second guitarist Marc Ford and bassist Johnny Colt had left the band in 1997. Audley Freed and Sven Pipien were hired as the new guitarist and bassist, respectively, although Rich Robinson played all the guitar parts on the album. \"By Your Side\" was recorded in New York City during the second quarter of 1998 and produced by Kevin Shirley. It comprised songs written in the studio, revised songs from pre-production and re-recorded songs from the abandoned 1997 album \"Band\".\n\nThe Black Crowes promoted \"By Your Side\" by performing on numerous television programs in North America and Europe. The album debuted at its peak position of number 26 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and generally received positive reviews. While some critics depreciated \"By Your Side\" for its similarity to albums by Rod Stewart and The Rolling Stones, most reviewers lauded The Black Crowes' return to the straightforward approach of their debut album, \"Shake Your Money Maker\" (1990). Chris Robinson's singing and Rich's guitar playing also won praise from critics, though reviews of the lyrics were mixed.\n\nBeginning in February 1999, the band toured North American theaters for two months in support of the album. Setlists from the tour, known as the \"Souled Out Tour\", typically included more than half the album's songs. The concerts were followed by a short co-headlining tour of US amphitheaters with Lenny Kravitz. The band spent the remainder of the summer opening for Aerosmith's European tour.\n\nPersonnel changes and label interference frustrated The Black Crowes' attempts to follow up their 1996 album \"Three Snakes and One Charm\". During May and June 1997, they recorded an album called \"Band\", but it was rejected by their label, American Recordings. Lead singer Chris Robinson said American \"couldn't go with the vibe\" and wanted something more \"safe\". In August, guitarist Marc Ford was fired due to a heroin habit that impaired his performances. Guitarist Rich Robinson said, \"We would be onstage playing 'Remedy', and he would be playing a completely different song... We told him to clean up or get out. We assumed, since he loved music and the band, that he would clean up.\" Bassist Johnny Colt had been losing interest in the band since the recording of \"Three Snakes and One Charm\"; his contributions to that album were minimal, as Rich played bass in his stead on all but one track. Colt quit in October to become a yoga instructor.\n\nSven Pipien was hired in December to replace Colt. Pipien had previously played with Mary My Hope and had been a housemate of Chris. Audley Freed was hired as the second guitarist before a 1998 tour in support of the band's \"Sho' Nuff\" box set. Recording sessions for \"By Your Side\" were well underway at this point, and continued after the tour, but Freed did not contribute to the album. Chris said of the new members, \"It's great. These guys want to be here—and we feed off of that. And that will become obvious when you see us on the road.\"\n\nAmerican Recordings was partially absorbed by Columbia Records in early 1998. Though the arrangement preserved the American label, The Black Crowes transferred to Columbia after privately expressing their desire to disassociate themselves from American Recordings founder Rick Rubin. Despite working under a larger label, the band felt they had more freedom and support under Columbia; Chris remarked, \"At American, I never knew what a record company did. We never had an A&R guy. Now we have a product manager... It's like ... I didn't know what the music business was.\"\n\nPre-production for \"By Your Side\" began in December 1997 with songs that later underwent substantial revision or were dropped altogether. Early versions of \"HorseHead\" and \"It Must Be Over\" were recorded at this point, and a reworked riff from \"Every Little Bit\" and some lyrics from \"Tickle Tickle\" were later incorporated into \"Heavy\". Some of the songs ultimately dropped, such as \"Baby\" and \"Bled to Death\", were later rewritten by Rich for his debut solo album, \"Paper\" (2004). More songs were introduced in January 1998, including \"Red Wine Stains\", which eventually became \"Go Faster\", and an early version of \"Virtue and Vice\". Some unused sections from this batch were borrowed for \"Paper\", as well, including the main riffs of what became \"Tomorrow Is Here\" and \"Thrown It All Away\".\nProducer Kevin Shirley was brought in on the advice of Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry. As Rich explained, \"We really wanted to work with someone who can come in and say, 'That's not good.' ... If Kevin says something I disagree with, he'll be the first one to say, 'Hey, it's your song,' but it's healthy for me and Chris to have him come in and be as excited about our songs as we are and say, 'Okay, that's cool, but what if we tried this?'\" At his first meeting with the band, Shirley described the songs played for him as having \"the same old jammy, shuffle feel of the last two records. I stopped them then and I said to them ... 'You've got to feel like you're teenagers again. You need a song like that.'\" Shirley's prompting led the band to write \"Kickin' My Heart Around\" on the spot, before he had signed on to produce. Rich agreed that Shirley shifted the focus to making \"a rock record\" that was \"focused and concise\".\nThe band hired Shirley and agreed to his recording conditions, which meant recording in New York City at Avatar Studios, taking weekends off and recording from 1:00–8:00 pm. Chris said of the rigid schedule, \"We loved it... We had lives other than just being in the studio 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Got a different vantage point on the whole thing.\" Shirley's laid-back style also won praise from the band. \"Kevin is the first guy that I've worked with that just went with it—especially my singing. A lot of this album is just my scratch vocals. It's very loose, and Kevin let it go... He'd say, if we didn't get it in two or three takes, 'We'll come back tomorrow'\", said Chris. Of the album's lyrical bent, Chris said, \"...there is a lot of love on it, and I've never written love songs. I do think having a muse in my life like the woman I'm with now helped... I think there's also a lot of humor on this album, which is something we haven't touched on before, except maybe on \"Shake Your Money Maker\", which was a lighter time and a lighter mood.\" There was also a conscious effort to \"simplify the language\", which was inspired by Chris's listening to music by Otis Redding, George Jones and Muddy Waters. \"I realized how direct and honest those records were – and I wanted that here\", said Chris.\n\nFor the first time on a Black Crowes album, Rich was the only guitarist involved in the recording. He said recording that way was not a challenge because he recorded most of the guitar parts on \"Three Snakes and One Charm\", as well. Rich also noted that having only one guitarist gives the band \"a different dynamic\" because it affords Pipien and keyboardist Eddie Harsch \"a lot of space\". Chris praised his brother's performance, saying, \"It sounds like there's two guitarists, two distinct personalities.\"\n\nFifteen songs were recorded in the second quarter of 1998 during the main recording session with Kevin Shirley. Some were updated versions of songs from pre-production; a few were totally new; others combined newly written music with parts from older, shelved songs. The main riff of a \"Three Snakes and One Charm\" leftover called \"Pastoral\", for example, was used for the B-side \"You Don't Have to Go\", while its chorus riff was borrowed for \"Then She Said My Name\". Four of the songs were holdovers from the \"Band\" sessions: \"Only a Fool\" and \"If It Ever Stops Raining\" were included on the album (the latter with new chorus lyrics as \"By Your Side\"), while \"Peace Anyway\" and \"Smile\" were released as B-sides. One cover song, Bob Dylan's \"When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky\", was recorded during the session and later released as a B-side.\n\nWhile touring in support of \"Sho' Nuff\", Chris and Rich finished writing \"Diamond Ring\" and \"Go Tell the Congregation\". The two songs were recorded after the tour during a planned session for putting finishing touches on \"By Your Side\", though the decision delayed the album's release from November 17 to January 12. Rich said, \"It's cool that Columbia Records is backing us on an artistic level and they're being open to all the hassles that come with moving an album into the new year. I know we're driving them insane with these last-minute changes, but we know it's all for the right reasons.\" After finishing the album, Chris noted that it \"has the same sort of energy\" as \"Shake Your Money Maker\", \"...but there is much more to it. There are a lot of subtleties in these songs. These are rock 'n' roll songs with subversive pop hooks.\"\n\nThe Black Crowes began promoting \"By Your Side\" in September 1998 when they performed at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City for an episode of the VH1 show \"Hard Rock Live\"; the episode aired on December 12. The first noticeable instance of promotion was Columbia's release of \"Kickin' My Heart Around\" as the album's first single on November 2, 1998. The track spent ten weeks at its peak position of number 3 on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart starting on November 28; it also charted in Canada and the UK. The band's next promotional event was a performance and interview for a live album premiere radio broadcast on January 6. On January 11, the Crowes performed \"Kickin' My Heart Around\" on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\".\n\"By Your Side\" was released on January 12, 1999. The album's cover art is a blue-tinted nighttime photograph of the band, all dressed in white and standing in front of a lake. The band name is rendered in tiny white lights above their heads, and other small white lights are scattered at their feet. In keeping with the tiny lights theme, the back of the booklet shows a satellite image of the United States at night, in which densely populated areas can be discerned by light pollution, and the booklet contains drawings of constellations. The album's disc artwork is designed after a centaur with a crow's head in place of the man's head.\n\nOn the day the album was released, the band appeared at a Tower Records store in Manhattan to sign autographs and give away 1,000 tickets to that night's private show at Irving Plaza. \"By Your Side\" debuted at its peak position of number 26 on the \"Billboard\" 200 on January 30. The album has sold 271,000 copies in the US as of January 2002. The next two weeks were filled with radio and television appearances in Canada, Belgium, France, Sweden, and Italy. The Black Crowes returned to the US to perform during pre-game festivities at Joe Robbie Stadium before Super Bowl XXXIII on January 31. While on tour in support of the album in February, the band performed the second single, \"Only a Fool\", on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\". The single was released in mid-February and peaked at number 7 on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The accompanying promotional video was directed by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. After an early April stop at an Atlanta radio station where the band played a half-hour acoustic set, The Black Crowes made a third late night television appearance at the end of that month, playing the album's third single, \"Go Faster\", on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\". \"Go Faster\" peaked at number 24 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in July. Also in late April, Chris Robinson promoted \"By Your Side\" in an interview on \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\".\n\n\"By Your Side\" was generally well received by critics. Regarding the songwriting, most reviewers praised The Black Crowes for returning to the straightforwardness of \"Shake Your Money Maker\" (1990) following the more adventuresome \"Amorica\" (1994) and \"Three Snakes and One Charm\". Gemma Tarlach of \"The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\" welcomed the album \"because it represents a great band's return to what it does best\", calling it \"45 minutes of good, dirty fun\". Wall of Sound's Russell Hall found that the band's emergence from \"the jam-band haze that's infected\" their recent work resulted in a \"laser-sharp focus\". Mark Falkner of \"The Florida Times-Union\" said that beyond the band's mastery of their influences' musical styles, what prevents them \"from being just another tribute act is that they have (also) mastered the power, the passion and the fun that made the mix work\". Some critics, also noting the change in approach, derided the band for returning to mine the same influences perceived in their debut album. Jim Farber of the \"Daily News\" thus described \"By Your Side\" as \"a copy-of-a-copy-of-a-copy\" and marked \"Go Faster\" a sped-up version of Humble Pie's \"Hot 'n' Nasty\". \"The Times\"' Nigel Williamson called \"HorseHead\" \"Zeppelinesque\" and labeled \"By Your Side\" \"a kicking boogie half way between [the Faces'] 'Cindy Incidentally' and [The Rolling Stones'] 'Tumbling Dice'\". Steve Dougherty of \"People\" summed up by commenting, \"Purists will wonder why to buy this album when [The Rolling Stones'] 1972 \"Exile on Main Street\" or [Rod] Stewart's 1970 \"Gasoline Alley\" exist on CD.\"\n\nOn some tracks, the influence of soul music was perceived. Richard Harrington of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that \"Only a Fool\" \"conjures '60s-era Stax-Volt passions while Robinson's jubilant vocals evoke Redding's rough-edged insistence\" and compared \"Diamond Ring\" to Al Green's work. The Dirty Dozen Brass Band's playing on \"Welcome to the Goodtimes\" was called \"infectious\" by Wayne Bledsoe of \"The Knoxville News-Sentinel\".\nThe musical performances and sound of the album were frequently hailed by critics. Lorraine Ali of \"Rolling Stone\" identified Rich Robinson's guitar playing as \"brilliant in spots, letting it rip with Southern-rock abandon or lazy, drawling slide guitar\". Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the band's retention of the sonic detail from \"Amorica\", and Jane Stevenson of the \"Toronto Sun\" appreciated the \"soulful\" backing vocals throughout. Echoing those sentiments was \"CMJ\", which noted the \"lazy slide-guitar textures, harmonica moans and choirs of soulful singers\", but also stated \"Chris Robinson's gritty, cocksure vocals blaze the trail.\" Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club called Robinson's vocal performance on \"HorseHead\" \"an inflection-for-inflection imitation of ... Billy Squier\"; elsewhere on the album Robinson's voice was compared to that of Rod Stewart. Stewart himself called the album \"brilliant\" and said it \"absolutely knocked [him] out\". Robinson's lyrics were alternately praised and panned. \"The Guardian\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Caroline Sullivan called \"Go Faster\" an amalgam of the band's interests, \"including drugs ... nubile wenchhood ... scrapes ... and touring\". \"The Washington Post\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Harrington, however, called Robinson \"convincing when he sings [in 'Virtue and Vice'], 'I feel so alive today and that's all I want to say/ I hope it stays this way,' adding, 'If not, I'll be okay'\".\n\nThe Black Crowes played a few shows in the eastern US in early January before the release of \"By Your Side\", then spent the rest of the month promoting the album via television appearances in the US, Canada and Europe. A brief warm-up show in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on February 10 preceded a two-month tour of North American theaters, called the Souled Out Tour, with Moke as the opening band. Every song from \"By Your Side\" was played at some point on this tour – \"Go Faster\", \"Kickin' My Heart Around\", \"By Your Side\" and \"Virtue and Vice\" were performed at most shows, but \"Diamond Ring\" was played only twice. A 1963 Fender Esquire guitar belonging to Rich was stolen from the backstage area at DeVos Performance Hall in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on February 16. The band's management waited six weeks before issuing a press release asking for its return, hoping the guitar would turn up in a local pawnshop. No update on the guitar was ever provided. After taking two weeks off, the band spent six weeks playing outdoor amphitheaters in the US on a co-headlining tour with Lenny Kravitz; opening acts were Everlast and Cree Summer.\n\nBeginning in June, The Black Crowes toured Europe for six weeks, opening for Aerosmith in concert halls and at festivals. \"Go Faster\" and \"Kickin' My Heart Around\" remained staples of the band's 60- to 75-minute sets. Harsch required emergency surgery for a twisted intestine on June 24 and missed the band's next eight shows. (The crew continued to set up Harsch's keyboards and placed a human-sized inflatable green alien in his spot.) One of the shows Harsch missed was a charity concert in London at which The Black Crowes played a 45-minute set of Led Zeppelin songs and blues covers with Jimmy Page. The band's last show in support of \"By Your Side\" was a one-off festival date in Niigata, Japan, on July 30.\n\nAll songs written by Chris Robinson and Rich Robinson.\n\nAustralian bonus disc\n\n\n\n\n"}

David is mentioned in a single document dated AM 4746 (985/986 CE) which contains a reference to \"our lord David, Prince of the Khazars, who lives in Taman.\" The document in question is of uncertain authenticity, as it passed through the hands of Abraham Firkovich, who on occasion is known to have forged documents and inscriptions.\n\nBased upon this text, Heinrich Graetz hypothesized that the Khazars reorganized themselves after 969 in Crimea and the Taman peninsula. Graetz further maintained that the Khazar Jewish representatives summoned by Vladimir I of Kiev to debate the merits of their religion against representatives from Catholic Germany, Orthodox Byzantium, and Muslim Volga Bulgaria were dispatched by David and were citizens of his Pontic kingdom.\n\nDavid's capital may have been in or near Tmutorakan; though rule by the Kievan Rus is reported in Russian sources before 985, it is conceivable that the Khazars reasserted control over the town or that David ruled as a client. The first independent Russian prince of Tmutorakan is Mstislav, whose rule began in 988. The later Khazar ruler Georgius Tzul ruled from Kerch; it is uncertain whether his kingdom was the same polity that had earlier been under the rule of David of Taman.\n\n"}

Here he fell under the influence of Mark Pattison, to whom his impressionable nature perhaps owed a certain over-fastidiousness that characterised his whole career. He also made the acquaintance of the leading English Positivists, to whose opinions he became an ardent convert. Yet he retained a strong sympathy with the Roman Catholic religion, and at one time spent several weeks in a Catholic monastery.\n\nOne other great influence appears in the admirable \"Life of St Bernard\", which he published in 1863, that of his friend Carlyle, to whom the work is dedicated, and with whose style it is strongly coloured. Meanwhile, he had been a regular contributor, first to the \"Literary Gazette\", edited by his friend John Morley, and then to the \"Saturday Review\" at its most brilliant epoch.\n\nIn 1868, he published a pamphlet entitled \"Irish Grievances shortly stated\". In 1878, he published a volume on Gibbon in the \"Men of Letters\" series, marked by sound judgment and wide reading. This he followed up in 1882 with his \"Macaulay\" in the same series. It exhibits, more clearly perhaps than any other of Morison's works, both his merits and his defects.\n\nMacaulay's bluff and strenuous character, his rhetorical style, his unphilosophical conception of history, were entirely out of harmony with Morison's prepossessions. Yet in his anxiety to do justice to his subject, he steeped himself in \"Macaulay\" until his style often recalls that which he is censuring. His brief sketch, \"Mme de Maintenon: une etude\" (1885), and some magazine articles, were the only fruits of his labours in French history.\n\nIn 1861, Morison married Frances Virtue (d.1878), the daughter of publisher George Virtue. They had three children: Theodore Morison, a principal of Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College from 1899 to 1905 which later on became Aligarh Muslim University and member of the Council of India from 1906; and daughters Helen Cotter, and Margaret.\n\nIn later life, he resided for some years in Paris, where his house was a meeting place for eminent men of all shades of opinion. Towards the close of his life, he meditated a work showing the application of positivist principles to conduct. Failing health compelled him to abandon the second or constructive part: the first, which attempts to show the ethical inadequacy of revealed religion and is marked in parts by much bitterness, was published in 1887 under the title of \"The Service of Man\".\n\nHe died at his house in FitzJohn Avenue, London, on 26 February 1888. \n\n\n"}

A year later, Grave Digger, now comprising Chris Boltendahl (vocals), Peter Masson (guitar), Willi Lackmann (bass) and Albert Eckardt (drums), released their debut album \"Heavy Metal Breakdown\".\n\nIn 1985, with Lackmann having left the band, they recorded and released their second album \"Witch Hunter\". Only after the album was completed, a replacement on bass was found in the form of C.F. Brank. Further festival appearances followed, a tour with Helloween as special guest and, finally, their third album \"War Games\" in January 1986. To promote this album, a triple headline tour with Celtic Frost and Helloween followed. Thereafter, Peter Masson gave way to Uwe Lulis; in 1987 the band's name was changed to Digger, the name under which they released the album \"Stronger Than Ever\". The album flopped, as it was not accepted by fans or the masses. As a result, Boltendahl declared at the end of 1987, the breakup of the band.\n\nIn 1991, the band was partially reformed. Boltendahl and Lulis, along with two newcomers, Tomi Göttlich and Jörg Michael, who had been the drummer for Rage and Running Wild, released a comeback record called \"The Reaper\" in 1993. This album was a return to the true roots of Grave Digger. In the same year, the album \"The Best of the Eighties\" was released. It represented a quasi Best-of-Album of their earlier songs.\n\nAn EP titled \"Symphony of Death\" followed in 1994. In the interim, Grave Digger, now with a new drummer, Frank Ullrich, toured Germany, playing as the warm-up act for Manowar. In 1995, the album \"Heart of Darkness\" appeared. It was a very dark album with many influences from the early works of Annihilator.\n\nIn 1996, Stefan Arnold became the band's new drummer. This year also marked the release of the concept album \"Tunes of War\", which dealt with the history of Scotland. This album was the first part of the \"Middle Ages Trilogy\". The second album, \"Knights of the Cross\", with Jens Becker as bass guitarist, was released in 1998 and was about the rise and fall of the Knights Templar. The final part of the trilogy finished in 1999 with \"Excalibur\". This album explored the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Shortly after, a tour soon followed through with keyboardist Hans-Peter Katzenburg, who later became a permanent band member.\n\nIn 2000, Grave Digger celebrated their 20th anniversary. To mark the occasion, they performed at a sell-out concert at the \"Zeche\" in Bochum. Many of the band's most popular songs were played alongside other less well-known ones. There were also a number of different supporting acts appearing with Grave Digger. This concert also marked a defining chapter in the band's history, as Uwe Lulis left a short while before the concert because of personal and business reasons. Lulis finally called his new band Rebellion.\n\nA replacement, in the form of the ex-Rage guitarist, Manni Schmidt, was found. Along with him and the new record label \"Nuclear Blast\", the album \"The Grave Digger\", appeared in 2001. The works of Edgar Allan Poe served as an inspiration for the lyrics of the new album. Their first live album, \"Tunes of Wacken\", appeared in 2002. This was coupled with the release of their first DVD, \"Wacken Open Air\". In 2003, a further concept album, \"Rheingold\", was released on 26 May, which centered on the opera Der Ring des Nibelungen by Richard Wagner. They embarked on a tour supporting the album into early 2004.\n\nAfter the successful Rheingold Tour, the band recorded another album, \"The Last Supper\", which was released on 17 January 2005. The artwork was first revealed in November 2004 which received positive feedback. A number of fans were disappointed by the artwork because of the motive. The band issued a statement saying that the cover isn't a message of the Devil and not against Christians, but a representation of a depressive Jesus Christ at his last days before his death. Unlike their previous albums, \"The Last Supper\" was not a concept album, despite several songs about the last days of Jesus. A few journalists described the album as the best since \"Tunes of War\" or \"Heavy Metal Breakdown\". According to the band, it contains \"more metal, more passion and more power\" than the group's previous efforts. Less than a month later, the band began a tour with Stormhammer and Astral Doors in Andernach, the birthplace of Manni Schmidt.\n\nOctober 2005 saw the release of a live DVD titled \"25 to Live\", which was recorded live in São Paulo, commemorating the band's 25th anniversary.\n\nIn December 2006, a number of release parties was announced for the band's follow-up album, \"Liberty or Death\", which was released on 12 January 2007. A Double-Headline Tour together with Therion followed, beginning 17 January 2007 in Essen.\n\nIn late February 2008, Grave Digger began writing new material. In mid-August, they entered Principal studios with additional guitarist Thilo Hermann to record their 13th studio album entitled \"Ballads of a Hangman\", which was released on 9 January 2009 under their new label Napalm Records. It was their first album with twin guitars.\n\nIn February 2009, the band parted ways with Thilo Hermann due to the built up excitement of a second guitarist and with the free space on stage and musical aspects that was observed by every old band member independently. In early October, Manni Schmidt left the band due to ongoing disagreements with Chris Boltendahl.\n\nOn 12 January 2010, Schmidt was replaced by Domain guitarist Axel Ritt after performing temporarily during the remaining dates of the band's previous tour.\n\nFrom mid-May to mid-July 2010, the band recorded their new album \"The Clans Will Rise Again\", which was released in Europe on 1 October with a North American release following soon after. The album is a loose sequel of the \"Tunes of War\" album, but this time it is not a concept album about the Scottish history. It's more of a work about Scotland, its mysticism and its people. On 11 September, Grave Digger released a video for \"Highland Farewell\", the fourth track appearing on the album.\n\nOn 27 July 2012, the band released a new EP entitled \"Home at Last\" with \"Clash of the Gods\" following on 31 August 2012. They performed a handful of shows in the UK and Europe from early to late 2012 and then toured throughout 2013 in Europe and a few shows in Brazil in support of the album.\n\nIn February 2014, the band began recording their next album \"Return of the Reaper\". On 20 March, the band revealed the artwork followed by the track listing on 23 April. It was released on 11 July. In mid-November, keyboard player Hans Peter Katzenburg left the band in order to spend more time on outside projects. He was replaced by Marcus Kniep, who would continue performing as The Reaper.\n\nIn October 2015, \"Exhumation – The Early Years\" was released, which contains re-recorded versions of the band's \"absolute classics with a dynamic and powerful sound of 2015,\" according to a press release.\n\nIn June 2016, Grave Digger entered the studio to begin working on their next album entitled \"Healed by Metal\", which was released on 13 January 2017. They embarked on a tour with Blind Guardian as the support act on their second leg North American tour supporting the album \"Beyond the Red Mirror\".\n\nIn March 2018, the band returned to the studio to record their nineteenth album \"The Living Dead\", which was released on 14 September 2018, with a European tour taking place in January 2019.\n\nOn 25 June 2018, longtime drummer Stefan Arnold departed the band and was replaced by keyboardist Marcus Kniep, thus returning Grave Digger as a quartet since 1996.\n\nGrave Digger's twentieth album \"Fields of Blood\" will be released on 29 May 2020, celebrating the band's 40th anniversary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Following the demise of the band she released a solo single \"Love Is All You Need\" in 1987. She then formed a new band Prime Time with partner Mick Bund who released a handful of singles. She then appeared on the dance track \"Fingertips\" by Lovecut DB in 1990.\n\nSaint Etienne was originally to be an indie dance act featuring various vocalists. After Moira Lambert sang on their initial 1990 single \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" and Donna Savage was heard on the follow-up single \"Kiss and Make Up,\" Cracknell lent her vocals to \"Nothing Can Stop Us\" and ended up doing the rest of the singing on their debut album \"Foxbase Alpha\". Cracknell has been Saint Etienne's permanent vocalist since then.\n\nPreceded by the single \"Anymore\" in 1996, Cracknell released a solo album, \"Lipslide\", in May 1997. Originally released in the UK only by Gut Records, the album featured dance, indie and pop tunes and received good reviews from critics, although it was not a big seller (Cracknell has in interviews placed some of the blame for this on lack of proper promotion by Gut). The UK version of the album is now deleted.\n\n\"Lipslide\" finally surfaced in the U.S. three years later, when Instinct Records released it in February 2000. With completely different cover art, the original album's track listing was also modified: five tracks were removed and four new songs plus a remix were added. Months later, Instinct released the \"Kelly's Locker\" EP, which contained the five tracks originally removed from the UK version of \"Lipslide\", along with two previously unreleased songs and a new remix.\n\nCracknell was Spiller's first choice for the vocals of his number-one hit \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" in 2000, but never got to record the song. She has recorded tracks with various artists such as David Holmes (\"Anymore\", \"Gone\"), Xploding Plastix (\"Sunset Spirals\"), Cheapglue (\"You've Just Won Me Over\") and Paul Van Dyk (\"The Riddle (Tell Me Why),\" although billed as a collaboration between Van Dyk and St. Etienne but with Cracknell on vocals).\n\nShe recorded a duet of Dusty Springfield's 1968 song \"I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten\" with Marc Almond for his album \"Stardom Road\", released in June 2007.\n\nIn December 2007, BBC radio began playing \"The Journey Continues\" by Mark Brown featuring Sarah Cracknell. The song consists of extensive samples from a composition by Elena Kats-Chernin entitled Eliza's Aria, well known to UK TV viewers as the music from the computer-animated 'For the Journey' commercials for Lloyds TSB bank. The single was released in February 2008 on Positiva. The song peaked at #11 in the UK after being released.\n\nCracknell has collaborated with French pop star Etienne Daho on several occasions. She co-wrote and sang back-up vocals on \"Les passagers\" from his 1996 album \"Eden\", and also co-wrote \"Le premier jour\" which was released as a single from his greatest hits compilation \"Singles\". With Saint Etienne, they collaborated on the \"Reserection EP\". Saint Etienne's single \"He's on the Phone\" (which featured both Cracknell and Daho) was actually an English-language adaptation of Daho's French language 1984 single \"Weekend à Rome\".\n\nOn 21 August 2014, Cherry Red Records announced that it had signed Cracknell to a worldwide deal under which she would release a new solo album. The album, entitled \"Red Kite\", was recorded in December 2014 and released on 15 June 2015. A series of live shows by Cracknell in support the album were planned for the weeks following its release.\n\nCracknell married Martin Kelly (joint managing director of Heavenly Recordings and Heavenly Films) in Kensington and Chelsea, London on 5 December 2004. They have two children, both born in Westminster, London: Spencer Michael (born 2001) and Sam Dion (born 2004).\n\nCracknell is the daughter of Stanley Kubrick's first assistant director Derek Cracknell.\n\nThe discography of the English singer, songwriter and recording artist Sarah Cracknell consists of two studio albums, two compilations, six solo singles and four singles as a featured artist.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2130642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2130642", "title": "The Bertrand Russell Case", "text": "The Bertrand Russell Case\n\nThe Bertrand Russell Case, known officially as Kay v. Board of Higher Education, was a case concerning the appointment of Bertrand Russell as Professor of Philosophy of the College of the City of New York, as well as a collection of articles on the aforementioned case, edited by John Dewey and Horace M. Kallen.\n\nIn 1940, Bertrand Russell was hired by the City College of New York to teach classes on logic, mathematics, and metaphysics of science. This appointment was made controversial by Dr. William Thomas Manning, the Episcopal Bishop of New York City, who argued that due to Bertrand Russell's writings against religion and approval of sexual acts disapproved of by traditional Christian teachings, he should not be instated as a professor. Following Manning's denunciation, a group of religious individuals lobbied New York City government institutions to reject Bertrand Russell's position as professor. However, despite this pressure, Russell was confirmed by the New York Board of Higher Education. Following this decision, the matter was taken to the New York Supreme Court by Jean Kay, who argued that her daughter would be morally compromised should she study under Russell, even though her daughter was not a student at CCNY, nor could she have been, as CCNY exclusively enrolled male students at the time.\n\nThe judge hearing the case was the Irish Catholic John E. McGeehan, who ruled against Russell's appointment on three criteria. First, McGeehan argued that Russell should not be allowed to teach due to his status as a non-citizen of the United States, whom New York law prohibited from teaching in public schools. Second, McGeehan wrote that Russell was not given a competitive examination of his merit for the position to which he was appointed. Thirdly, McGeehan concluded that Russell held immoral views regarding sexuality on the basis of four of his popular and non-philosophic books (\"On Education\", \"What I Believe\", \"Education and the Modern World\", and \"Marriage and Morals\"), and that his opinions regarding sexual relations between college-aged students amounted to an endorsement of abduction, rendering him morally unfit to teach philosophy and an advocate of lawlessness. In the books, Russell advocated for sex before marriage, homosexuality, temporary marriages, and the privatization of marriage, among other things.\n\nRussell was prevented from appearing in court and an appeal by the American Civil Liberties Union was denied in several courts. The City of New York's lawyers told the Board of Higher Education that the verdict would not be appealed. A few days later Mayor La Guardia removed the funds for the position from the budget.\n\nJudge McGeehan's ruling was published as \"Kay v. Board of Higher Ed. of City of New York\", 193 Misc. 943 18 N.Y.S. (2d) 821 (1940).\n\nWhen Russell published \"An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth\", the lectures he gave at Harvard that fall, he added \"Judicially pronounced unworthy to be Professor of Philosophy at the College of the City of New York\" to the listing of distinctions and academic honors on the title page in the British version. Russell commented on Judge McGeehan, writing, \"As an Irish Catholic, his views were perhaps prejudiced,\" and compared his case to the case against Socrates saying that \"precisely the same accusations were brought — atheism and corrupting the young.\"\n\nFollowing his dismissal, Russell was hired by Albert C. Barnes, who wrote the forward for \"The Bertrand Russell Case\", to teach for the Barnes Foundation. However, he was dismissed in December 1942 due to his distaste for lecturing and his impolite attitude towards students, which Barnes saw as in violation to democracy and education.\n\nIn 1941, John Dewey and Horace M. Kallen published \"The Bertrand Russell Case\", a collection of articles defending Russell's appointment and criticizing McGeehan's ruling, characterizing it as unjust, punitive, and libelous.\n\nA major theme treated by the book is the necessity of academic freedom in American universities. Many of the essayists featured in the \"Bertrand Russell Case\" see Russell's dismissal as a microcosm of American democracy, in which freedom of expression is stifled by religious individuals. Additionally, many of the book's authors discuss at length the necessity for academic disciplines to feature counter-cultural thinkers, as they are skeptical of a framework of thought enforced by religious or political individuals.\n\n\"The Bertrand Russell Case\" contains an introduction by John Dewey, a foreword by Albert C. Barnes, and nine essays. Kallen and Dewey each contributed a single essay to the collection. While most of the articles are written by philosophers and other academics and argue in favor of Russell and academic freedom, the article \"The Attitude of the Episcopal Church,\" which argues that Manning's assertions do not reflect the opinion of the church as a whole, was written by Guy Emery Shipler, editor of The Churchman, and \"The Case as a School Administrator Sees it\" was written by Carleton Washburne, an Illinois Superintendent.\n\n\"The Bertrand Russell Case\" was celebrated by many academics for its defense of academic freedom. In a review for the American Association of University Professors, Peter A. Carmichael writes, \"The authors of this book deserve praise for their able defense of intellectual freedom and of a very great intellect,\" despite the book's lack of any religious perspective. Writing for the History of Science Society's publication \"Isis\", M. F. Ashley Montagu characterizes \"The Bertrand Russell Case\" as \"an important book\" and argues that all scholars should read it in order to better resist the encroachment of religious forces into science and academic study.\n\n"}

{"id": "2130666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2130666", "title": "Upper Hungary", "text": "Upper Hungary\n\nUpper Hungary is the usual English translation of Felvidék (lit.: \"Upland\"), the Hungarian term for the area that was historically the northern part of the Kingdom of Hungary, now mostly present-day Slovakia. The region has also been called \"Felső-Magyarország\" (lit: \"Upper Hungary\", ).\n\nDuring the Habsburg–Ottoman wars, Upper Hungary meant only the northeastern parts of the Hungarian Kingdom. The northwestern regions (present-day western and central Slovakia) belonged to \"Lower Hungary\". Sometime during the 18th or 19th centuries, Upper Hungary began to imply the whole northern regions of the kingdom. \nThe population of Upper Hungary was mixed and mainly consisted of Slovaks, Hungarians, Germans and Ruthenians. The first complex demographic data are from the 18th century, in which Slovaks constituted the majority population in Upper Hungary. Slovaks called this territory \"\"Slovensko\"\" (Slovakia), which term appears in written documents from the 15th century, but it was not precisely defined and the region inhabited by Slovaks held no distinct legal, constitutional, or political status within Upper Hungary.\n\nHistorically there are different meanings:\n\n1. The older Hungarian term \"Felső-Magyarország\" (literally: \"Upper Hungary\"; ; ; ; ) formally referred to what is today Slovakia in the 16th-18th centuries and informally to all the northern parts of the Kingdom of Hungary in the 19th century.\n\n2. There are some 16th-century sources which refer to the Slovak-inhabited territory of the Kingdom of Hungary as \"Sclavonia\" or \"Slováky\", names that distinguish the region ethnically as well as geographically.\n\n3. The Hungarian \"Felvidék\" (literally: \"Upper Country\", \"Upland\", \"Highland,\" or perhaps more accurately \"Upper Landscape\" or \"Upper Countryside\"; ; ; ) has had several informal meanings:\n\nAfter World War I, the meaning of \"Felvidék\" in the Hungarian language (\"Felső-Magyarország\" was not used anymore) was restricted to the Slovakian and Carpathian Ruthenian parts of Czechoslovakia. Today the term \"Felvidék\" is sometimes used in Hungary when speaking about Slovakia, and it is exclusively (and anachronistically) used in Hungarian historical literature when speaking about the Middle Ages, i.e., before the name actually came into existence. The three counties of the region that remained in Hungary after World War I, however, are never called Upper Hungary today, only Northern Hungary (\"Észak-Magyarország\"). Any use of the word \"Felvidék\" to denote all of modern Slovakia is considered offensive by Slovaks, and inappropriate by some Hungarians, but it is now commonly used by the sizeable Hungarian minority in the southern border-zone of Slovakia to identify the Hungarian-majority areas where they live. Some of them call themselves \"felvidéki magyarok\", i.e. the \"Upland Hungarians.\" The word \"felvidék\" is also used as a component of the toponym \"Balaton-felvidék,\" describing the hilly area north of Lake Balaton, with no connection to the historical Upper Hungary.\n\nThe term \"Upper Hungary\" often occurs in publications on history as a somewhat-anachronistic translation of other, earlier (then Latin) designations denoting approximately the same territory. Some of the other terms were \"Partes Danubii septentrionales\" (Territories to the north of the Danube) or \"Partes regni superiores\" (Upper parts of the Kingdom). The actual name \"Upper Hungary\" arose later from the latter phrase.\n\nIn the 15th century, the \"Somorja (Šamorín), Nagyszombat (Trnava), Galgóc (Hlohovec), Nyitra (Nitra), Léva (Levice), Losonc (Lučenec), Rimaszombat (Rimavská Sobota), Rozsnyó (Rožňava), Jászó (Jasov), Kassa (Košice), Gálszécs (Sečovce), Nagymihály (Michalovce)\" line was the northern \"boundary\" of the Hungarian ethnic area.\n\nThe Principality of Nitra emerged in the 8th century and developed into an independent Slavic state; although the polity may have lost its independence when it was still at the stage of development. In the early 9th century, the polity was situated on the north-western territories of present-day Slovakia.\n\nThe term emerged approximately after the conquest of today's Hungary by the Ottomans in the 16th century when \"Felső-Magyarország\" (German: \"Oberungarn;\" Slovak: \"Horné Uhorsko\") referred to present-day eastern Slovakia and the adjacent territories of today's Hungary and Ukraine that were not occupied by the Ottoman Empire. That territory formed a separate military district (the \"Captaincy of Upper Hungary\" (1564–1686) headquartered in Kassa/Kaschau/Košice) within Royal Hungary. At that time, present-day western Slovakia, and sometimes also the remaining territories of Royal Hungary to the south of it, were called Lower Hungary (Hungarian: \"Alsó-Magyarország;\" German: \"Niederungarn;\" Slovak: \"Dolné Uhorsko\").\n\nIt was briefly a separate vassal state of the Ottoman Empire under Imre Thököly in the 1680s.\n\nThis usage occurs in many texts up to around 1800 – for example, the renowned mining school of Schemnitz/Selmecbánya/Banská Štiavnica in present-day central Slovakia was founded in \"Lower\" Hungary (not in \"Upper\" Hungary) in the 18th century and Pozsony (today's Bratislava) was also referred to as being in \"Lower\" Hungary in the late 18th century.\n\nFrom the 18th century (in many texts however only after around 1800) until 1920, the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary north of the Tisza and the Danube, which comprised present-day Slovakia, Carpathian Ruthenia, and approximately the counties of Nógrád, Heves, and Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén, was informally called either \"Upper Hungary\" or \"Upland\" (\"Felső-Magyarország\" or \"Felvidék\"). Although not strictly defined, the name \"Felvidék\" became commonplace to the point that at least one publication concerning the area used it as its title. Other nations used the terms \"Upper Hungary\" (for the northern part of the Kingdom), \"Slovakia\" (only for the territory predominantly inhabited by the Slovaks), and \"Ruthenia\" (the territory predominantly inhabited by the Ruthenians) in parallel. The Slovaks themselves called the territories of the Kingdom of Hungary to the south of Slovakia \"Dolná zem\" (\"Lower Land\").\n\nIn the course of the creation of Czechoslovakia at the end of World War I, Czechoslovakia originally demanded that all of the so-called Upper Hungary be added to Czechoslovak territory (i.e. including the territory between the Tisza River and present-day Slovakia). The claim for its acquisition, however, was not based on the whole area having a single common name, \"Upper Hungary\", but on the presence of a Slovak minority in the region.\n\nIn 1720 of the 63 largest towns on the territory of present-day Slovakia with at least 100 taxpaying households 40 had Slovak majority, 14 German and 9 Hungarian majority.\n\nThe first ethnic data of whole Hungarian Kingdom by county was published in 1842. According to this survey the total population of the counties in Upper Hungary exceeded 2.4 million, with the following ethnic distribution: 59.5% Slovaks, 22% Magyars, 8.3% Ruthenians, 6.7% Germans and 3.6% Jews.\n\nUpper Hungary included the counties of Pozsony, Nyitra, Bars, Hont, Trencsén, Turóc, Árva, Liptó, Zólyom, Gömör és Kis-Hont, Szespes, Abaúj-Torna, Sáros and Zemplén. In the last census of 1910 in the Kingdom of Hungary, which was based on native language, Slovak language users were a majority in many of these counties.\n\n"}

He is best known for transforming the Scottish bank The Royal Bank of Scotland from a struggling regional player into a quasi global bank with parallels to Citigroup or HSBC. He was described by the \"Sunday Herald\", as \"banking's answer to Bruce Springsteen\".\n\nHe is the convener of Scotland's Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nMathewson was born in Dunfermline, the son of George Mathewson, an electrical engineer from Perth, and Charlotte Gordon Ross. He was educated at Perth Academy and the University of St Andrews' Queen's College in Dundee, from where he graduated in 1961 with a degree in mathematics and applied physics.\n\nMathewson started his career as a lecturer at St Andrews University where he did a PhD, before moving to United States to work for Bell Aerospace as an engineer in Buffalo, New York (1967–72). He was attracted back to Scotland by the opening up of the North Sea to oil exploration and joined venture capital group 3i, then called Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation (1972–81). He was chief executive of the state-funded economic regeneration organisation the Scottish Development Agency (now called Scottish Enterprise) during the Margaret Thatcher years (1981–87). In this role Mathewson led initiatives including the creation of Silicon Glen – using state subsidies to help attract high-tech businesses to Scotland's central lowlands.\n\nMathewson joined the Royal Bank of Scotland, which is headquartered in the Scottish capital city of Edinburgh, in 1987 as director of strategic planning and development. The following year the Scottish bank showed signs of international ambition by acquiring the US-based Citizens Financial Group and by entering a long-term \"strategic alliance\" with the Spanish bank Banco Santander. While the first deal became the springboard for RBS gaining a significant US presence, the deal with Santander was dissolved in 2004 after the Spanish bank offended its UK partner by taking over its UK rival Abbey National.\n\nWhen Mathewson became RBS's chief executive in 1992 the bank had been severely weakened by bad debts arising from poor lending decisions, which had been exacerbated by the economic slowdown of the early 1990s. To get the bank onto an even keel, Mathewson commissioned 'Project Columbus', which transformed the processes and structure of RBS's UK retail banking operations and included a tightening of credit controls, a focus on sales and a modernisation of processes and management. This earned him a reputation for ruthlessness but gave the bank a solid platform for growth. In 1998 RBS became the first ever Scottish company to make profits of more than £1 billion. He was knighted for services to Scottish business the following year.\n\nThe defining moment of Mathewson's career came with the £20 billion takeover of the much larger UK bank National Westminster Bank in February 2000. The acquisition was a sweet triumph for Mathewson, who mustered support from investment banks Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs to defeat RBS's Scottish arch-rival the Bank of Scotland, which had opened the bidding for NatWest. Some argue that Mathewson would not have dared to make a hostile bid for NatWest if Sir Peter Burt, chief executive of the Bank of Scotland, had not gone first.\n\nSoon after the NatWest acquisition, Mathewson stepped down as RBS's CEO, handing the reins to his deputy Fred Goodwin, who assumed responsibility for integrating NatWest. Mathewson became executive deputy chairman of the enlarged RBS Group. He became chairman in May 2001 following the retirement of former Tory politician George Younger.\n\nWhile Mathewson was chairman, RBS bought Cleveland, Ohio-based Charter One, which was bolted onto the bank's Citizens arm, and a five per cent stake in Beijing-based Bank of China. Mathewson stepped down as chairman in April 2006, and was succeeded by former AstraZeneca chief executive Sir Tom McKillop, who is three years his junior. He became something of an iconic figure in Scottish business circles as a result of the transformation of RBS.\n\nAfter retiring from RBS, Mathewson became chairman of the campaign board of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh and non-executive chairman of hedge fund Tosca, which was active in RBS's disastrous takeover in 2007 of Dutch bank ABN Amro. He is also a non-executive director of investment company the Scottish Investment Trust, wealth managers Cheviot Asset Management and Perth-based bus and train company Stagecoach Group. He is on the board of directors of the Institute of International Finance and president of the International Monetary Conference.\n\nMathewson was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1985 New Year Honours. He was knighted in the 1999 New Year Honours for services to economic development in Scotland and banking. \n\nIn 1966, Mathewson married Sheila Alexandra Graham Bennett, daughter of Eon Bennett, and has two sons.

His satires, which at times are tedious, also show an overwhelming moral zeal added to a sense of mission.\n\nMoscherosch was the son of farmer and bailiff Michael Moscherosch and his wife Veronika Beck. He grew up on his parents' farm in Willstätt in the County of Hanau-Lichtenberg, Germany. At the age of 11 he attended high school in Strassburg (now in France) and then studied law, philosophy and literature at the University of Strassburg. We owe the only eyewitness account of the theatrical performances of Caspar Brülow to his diary. In September 1623 Moscherosch defended his dissertation on Suetonius' \"The Twelve Caesars\" diatribe XV before a committee chaired by Matthias Bernegger. Following his award of the degree of \"Magister\" on April 8, 1624 he enrolled at the University of Geneva in Switzerland.\n\nAfter completing his studies Moscherosch first took educational trips to France and Switzerland, and then worked as a private tutor. From 1631 to 1634 he was one of the bailiffs of the Lutheran branch of the Counts of Kriechingen (today Créhange in France) and in the same capacity in the half of Saarwellingen belonging to Kriechingen. In 1636 the Pomeranian Duke of Croy-Arschot appointed him steward of his interest in the divided lordship of Finstingen (today Fénétrange), not far from Kriechingen. In this position, which he held until 1642, Moscherosch had to defend the rights of his employer in a confined space against the bailiffs of the other five lords. After his activities in the Lorraine border region Moscherosch fled the turmoil of the Thirty Years' War to Strassburg where he was chief of police and tax collector from 1645 to 1655. He also studied the medieval manuscripts of the city's library, such as Gottfried von Hagenau's \"Liber sex festorum beatae Virginis\".\n\nFrom 1656 he served as a legal adviser to Friedrich Casimir, Count of Hanau-Lichtenberg. Due to financial mismanagement the relatives of the Count, in particular the guardians of his nephew and successor, Christian II, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld and Countess Palatine Anna Magdalena of Pfalz-Birkenfeld-Bischweiler, obtained from the Kaiser sequestration of the county and a guaranteed right to share in the government in the county. The advisers to the Count including Moscherosch were dismissed. He next entered the service of the Elector of Mainz, and in 1664 he moved to Kassel to the court of the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel.\n\nOn September 9, 1628 Moscherosch married Esther Ackermann, who died in December 1632 during the turmoil of the Thirty Years' War. On August 20, 1633 he married his second wife, Maria Barbara Paniel, who died of plague on November 6, 1634, aged barely twenty. On October 4, 1636, he married his third wife Anna Maria Kilburger. From these three marriages he had fourteen children, of whom many did not survive infancy. Moscherosch died in Worms of a \"high fever\" on April 4, 1669 on his way to visit his son Ernst Bogislav in Frankfurt am Main.\n\nMoscherosch's life encompasses the entire Thirty Years' War whose cruelties and excesses are reflected in detail in his work.\n\nMoscherosch published essays, poems and short stories in Latin and German under the pseudonym \"Philander von Sittewald\"—\"Sittewald\" is a play on the name of his birthplace, Willstaett. The \"Aufrichtige Tannengesellschaft\"—a German Language society founded in 1633 in Strassburg by Jesaias Rompler and Johannes Freinsheim—counted Moscherosch along with Johann Matthias Schneuber among its most eminent members.\n\nIn 1645 Prince Ludwig I of Anhalt-Köthen awarded him membership in the \"Fruitbearing Society\", a prestigious German literary society. The society assigned him the nickname \"The Dreaming\" (\"der Träumende\") and the motto \"high things\" (\"hohe Sachen \"). His emblem was the nightshade (Solanum nigrum). In the annals of the society Moscherosch is entry number 436.\n\nMoscherosch's most famous work is \"Wunderliche und Wahrhafftige Gesichte Philanders von Sittewald\" (Wondrous and True Visions of Philander von Sittewald), a collection of fourteen satirical narratives published from 1640, an adaptation of the Spanish book \"Los Sueños\" by Francisco de Quevedo. One of the stories, \"Soldatenleben\" (Military Life), was republished in 1996.\n\nMoscherosch appears in the 1979 fictional story The Meeting at Telgte (\"Das Treffen in Telgte\") by Günter Grass.\n\n"}

It is located on the Rhode and West Rivers near Edgewater in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, near the western shore of Chesapeake Bay. The center's focus of study is the ecosystems of coastal zones, particularly in the Chesapeake Bay estuary and nearby wetlands.\n\nIn 1964, Robert Lee Forrest of Baltimore left a 365-acre dairy farm on the Rhode River to the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nIn 1965, the Chesapeake Center for Field Biology was established on the site of this former dairy farm. A $375,000 grant from the Ford Foundation was awarded and another $550,000 in other grants followed by the end of 1969. These funds were used to purchase another 568 additional acres adjoining the original parcel.\n\nIn 1970, the Chesapeake Bay Center for Field Biology was renamed to the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies (CBCES) and land acquisition continued.\n\nIn 1974, Jim Lynch was hired as the first on-site staff scientist. Lynch had recently finished his Ph.D. from University of California, Berkeley in Zoology.\n\nThe 2,600 acre site occupied by SERC contains coastal plain forests, land used for agriculture, wetlands and marshes, and brackish environments.\n\nSERC conducts research on topics that include terrestrial, atmospheric, and estuarine environmental research within the disciplines of botany, ecology, environmental education, biology, chemistry, mathematics, microbiology, physics, and zoology. The center trains interns and graduate students, including pre-doctoral and doctoral students. Annually, the center receives over 10,000 students, teachers, and families who come to visit. It gives advice, consultation, and testimony to local, state, federal, and international governmental agencies, natural resource managers, policy makers, and conservation organizations.\n\nIt serves as a center of research and education on human impacts in land-sea interactions of the coastal zone. The center receives $20,000,000 in extramural grants and contracts funded from governmental agencies, foundations, and industry.\n\nSERC developed and maintains an extensive database of invasive species in marine and estuarine ecosystems. The database tracks details on over 500 invasive species throughout coastal North America. SERC coordinates with the United States Geological Survey, which has developed a similar database for freshwater invasions, and has worked with marine centers in other nations to study marine invasions.\n\nThe center has been an innovator of biotelemetry to track behavior, habitat use, and movement of blue crabs \"(Callinectes sapidus)\", a marine predator and a valuable crustacean fishery in North America. They are the patent holder for the Spectral Radiometer, the national standard for monitoring solar radiation. The center has developed a model for testing estuarine water quality and watershed nutrient discharges.\n\n"}

The show aired from June 13, 2005 to March 14, 2008.\n\nIn February 2005 Carlson was signed by MSNBC to host a primetime show slated to debut in the second quarter of 2005. It debuted on June 13, 2005. , the program was known as \"The Situation with Tucker Carlson\". In the program, Carlson debated with a number of guests: one segment involving a liberal and one with former \"Around the Horn\" sports show host Max Kellerman. Kellerman would provide an argument against Carlson's opinion, regardless of whether he himself disagreed with Carlson. This style prompted comparisons to sports talk shows that use a similar format, such as ESPN's \"Pardon the Interruption\". \"Tucker\" was produced by Bill Wolff, who worked with Kellerman on two other \"PTI\"-styled sports shows, \"Around the Horn\" and \"I, Max\".\n\nIn addition, Carlson interviewed guests, most often politicians or newsmakers. The show aired on MSNBC weekdays at 6 PM ET. Commercials for the show branded it as \"Tucker\" (Live).\n\nThe show had seven regular segments. This format was generally followed, except in such extraordinary cases as the two episodes broadcast from London after the July 7 bombings and episodes broadcast during (and after) Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n\nFirst, there was an opening segment in which Carlson introduces his panelist and debates four to five news stories with him or her. Second, in \"Crime Blotter,\" Carlson introduced three stories about \"wrongdoing and justice served\" and typically discussed one of them with a guest, usually via satellite, on a number of topics related to a situation. Third, in \"The Outsider,\" Carlson debated a variety of news-inspired issues with Max Kellerman, who played devil's advocate regardless of his personal viewpoint. Fourth, in \"Curious Situation\", Carlson introduced a story in the news and was joined by a guest, usually via satellite and typically pre-recorded, to discuss this situation. Fifth, in \"First Look\", Carlson was joined by his senior producer, Willie Geist, to take a look at tomorrow's news. Sixth, in \"Voicemail\", viewers were encouraged to call in and leave messages for Carlson. Four to five messages, on a variety of topics ranging from stories that aired on the program to a drinking game for the show to Carlson's bow tie, were aired and commented on. Finally, in \"The Cutting Room Floor,\" Carlson joked about non-serious stories with Geist, son of Bill Geist from CBS.\n\nThe original format of the program, prior to its move to 11 p.m. on August 8, 2005, initially had six regular segments. First, there was a segment in which Carlson introduced his two panelists and debated five to six news stories with them. Second, in \"Op-Ed Op-Ed,\" Carlson introduced three editorials from newspapers nationwide and debated them with the panelists. Third, in \"Free Speak,\" Tucker spoke with a politician or newsmaker, usually via satellite, on a number of topics related to his or her situation. The fourth segment followed the same structure as the first. Fifth, in \"The Outsider,\" Carlson debated a variety of news-inspired issues with Max Kellerman. Finally, \"The Cutting Room Floor\" segment of the show remained the same.\n\nAfter the show changed its name to \"Tucker\" and time slots to 6 p.m., \"The Outsider\" was removed and new segments like \"Beat the Press\" were added. The segments were later dropped, replaced with a panel discussion with two or three guests. It usually ran two–three segments.\n\nWhen Geist moved to \"Morning Joe\", the last segment that regularly featured him instead had fellow MSNBC producer and contributor Bill Wolff.\n\n\"Tucker\" was cancelled by MSNBC and replaced with \"Race for the White House with David Gregory\", until December 2008 when Gregory became a moderator of \"Meet the Press\". The last airing was shown on March 14, 2008. Carlson continued to be a political contributor to MSNBC until May 19, 2009 when he was hired as a Fox News contributor.\n\nThere were rotating guests, including MSNBC political analyst Pat Buchanan, \"The Hill\" associate editor A.B. Stoddard, Democratic strategist Peter Fenn, \"Newsweek\" magazine's Richard Wolffe and Democratic analyst Hilary Rosen.\n\nSubstitute hosts in the past included MSNBC's Alison Stewart and Chris Jansing, WABC radio host Curtis Sliwa, sports host Max Kellerman (himself a former frequent guest), and Willie Geist. Geist could be seen at the end of most editions in a segment called \"In Other News,\" similar in format to \"The Cutting Room Floor.\" On February 7, 2008, substitute host David Shuster made controversial comments regarding Chelsea Clinton, resulting in his suspension from MSNBC.\n\nMSNBC and NBC News programming is shown for several hours a day on the 24-hour news network Orbit News in Europe and the Middle East.

She was named after Edisto Island, South Carolina. The island is named after the Native American Edisto Band who inhabited the island and the surrounding area. As of 2011 there is a namesake cutter USCGC \"Edisto\" (WPB-1313). The newer \"Edisto\" is a 110-foot and is stationed in San Diego County, California.\n\n\"Edisto\" was one of the icebreakers designed by Lieutenant Commander Edward Thiele and Gibbs & Cox of New York, who modeled them after plans for European icebreakers he obtained before the start of World War II. She was the last of seven completed ships of the of icebreakers operated by the United States Coast Guard. Her keel was laid on May 15, 1945 at Western Pipe and Steel Company shipyards in San Pedro, California, she was launched on December 28, 1946, and commissioned on March 20, 1947.\n\nHer outer hull plating was constructed with -thick high tensile steel. \"Edisto\" had a double bottom above the waterline with the two \"skins\" being approximately apart, insulated with cork. Framing was closely spaced and the entire hull girder was designed for great strength. \"Edisto\"s bow had the characteristic sloping forefoot that enabled her to ride up on heavy ice and break it with the weight of the vessel. \"Edisto\"s stern was similarly shaped to facilitate breaking ice while backing down. The sides of the icebreaker were rounded, with marked tumble home, that enabled the ship to break free from ice by heeling from side to side. Such heeling was accomplished by shifting water rapidly from wing tanks on one side of the ship to the other. A total of 220 tons of water could be shifted from one side to the other in as little as 90 seconds, which induced a list of 10 degrees. Ballast could also be shifted rapidly between fore and aft tanks to change the trim of the ship. Diesel electric machinery was chosen for its controlability and resistance to damage.\n\n\"Edisto\" was built during peacetime, so she had a much lighter armament than her war-built sisters, one 38 caliber deck gun when in Navy service, and unarmed for the Coast Guard.\n\nOn April 11, 1947, \"Edisto\" sailed for the United States East Coast on a shake-down cruise. That summer, during a training cruise to Greenland, she crossed the Arctic Circle for the first of many times in her career. Upon her return to Boston, Massachusetts, \"Edisto\" was assigned to Task Force 39 for the Second Antarctic Development Project. She sailed on November 1, 1947 for a rendezvous via the Panama Canal with at American Samoa. Together, they ventured south, becoming the first ships to penetrate the pack ice east of the Ross Sea. While in the Antarctic on this deployment, \"Edisto\" trained sailors and tested cold weather equipment, as well as investigating installations and equipment left by Operation Highjump of the previous year. She also collected valuable scientific data concerning geographic, hydrographic, photographic, oceanographic, meteorological, and electromagnetic conditions in the south polar regions.\n\nUpon her return to Boston, Massachusetts on March 31, 1948, \"Edisto\" immediately began preparing for operations in the far north. During this summer deployment, her task force resupplied weather stations at Thule, Greenland, and on Ellesmere and Ellif Renghes Islands. The ships in this task force did reconnaissance to establish additional weather stations, trained men in cold weather operations, tested equipment, and collected a variety of data. Except for brief repairs in Boston for replacement of a broken propeller shaft, \"Edisto\" continued this grueling grind until September 25, 1948. During December 1948, in company with , she successfully rescued , which had been damaged by ice and had run aground in Tunulliarfik Fjord at Narsaq, Greenland.\n\nThe next cruise of \"Edisto\" to the north polar regions was for purely exploratory purposes. Not even waiting for summer, she sailed out of Boston Harbor on January 24, 1949 to determine how much an icebreaker would be limited by the foul Arctic storms and lowest temperatures. She weathered extreme sub-zero conditions and returned to Boston on March 25, 1949.\n\nFrom 1949 until her transfer to the U.S. Coast Guard on October 20, 1965, \"Edisto\" continued her support to exploration in both Arctic and Antarctic regions. The icebreaker supplied bases, reported ice packs and floes, took part in oceanographic, hydrographic, geological, coast and geodetic, and hydrophone surveys, and participated in Arctic convoy exercises. In 1949, \"Edisto\" took part in Operation Bluejay, the construction of radar stations in the far north. The following year, on August 6, 1950, \"Edisto\" set a record for northern most penetration by reaching latitude 82 degrees North while conducting oceanographic surveys. In 1952, the work she had begun in Operation Bluejay was completed.\n\nWhile participating in Operation Deep Freeze I during the winter (Antarctic summer) of 1955-1956, \"Edisto\" penetrated unexplored areas in the Antarctic near Cape Hallett, leaving \"Edisto Bay\" and \"Edisto Acres\" penguin rookery named in her honor. After her return to Boston the ship was again assigned to Arctic missions, aiding shipping in the Newfoundland and Labrador area for the remainder of 1956 and all of 1957. In December 1958, \"Edisto\" departed for Operation Deep Freeze IV. Her work in the Antarctic this time was in support of the International Geophysical Year. From April 16–26, 1959, while en route home, she stopped in Montevideo, Uruguay, which was experiencing disastrous floods. The crew labored many long hours in flood relief work, rescuing 227 persons by helicopter, thereby receiving the personal thanks of the president of Uruguay on their departure.\n\nHer next Antarctic trip came during the winter (Antarctic summer) of 1960-1961 as a member of Operation Deep Freeze 61. While operating far south of New Zealand in an attempt to salvage a naval vessel that had broken loose from its moorings, \"Edisto\" encountered what was probably the worst storm of her career. With tons of ice loading her topside down, she staggered to regain stability at the end of each long, agonizing roll. Before the storm had blown itself out, \"Edisto\" had lost most of her rigging and her starboard propeller.\n\nAs a unit of the task force for Operation Deep Freeze 63 in 1962-1963, she spent 131 consecutive days in the ice. During this time, her crew witnessed the breakup of Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd's Little America III, built in 1940 and 1941. Instead of going south for the 1963-1964 season in the Antarctic, \"Edisto\" entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for an overhaul. Then, on June 15, 1964, she departed Boston for military resupply operations in the Arctic. While on this cruise, \"Edisto\" used Prince Christian Sound instead of rounding Cape Farewell, Greenland probably making her the first US naval vessel to transit this sound since in 1941. Before returning to Boston in early October 1964, she picked up some scientists in Iceland and proceeded to the waters between Greenland and Spitsbergen, Norway to carry out an oceanographic survey.\n\nOn December 10, 1964, \"Edisto\" departed for the Antarctic as a unit of the task force for Operation Deep Freeze 65 on an assignment unprecedented in icebreaker history. She had the responsibility for constructing the new Palmer Station for marine biological studies on Anvers Island off the Antarctic Peninsula. No sooner had she accomplished this assignment and returned to Boston, than \"Edisto\" was ordered to sail on a polar rescue mission. Drifting south was the Ice Island Arlis II, with 20 scientists on board waiting to be evacuated before the island broke up underneath them. Departing Boston on April 6, 1965, after a stay of only five days, she battled some of the thickest and hardest ice ever encountered by an American icebreaker to moor alongside Ice Island Arlis II and to effect the evacuation of the men and equipment.\n\nDuring the summer of 1965, \"Edisto\" again sailed to the Arctic in support of the northern defense outposts and for oceanographic survey work. Before her return to Boston in early October 1965, a message informed her that she would be the first of the United States Navy icebreakers turned over to the United States Coast Guard under the transfer agreement signed between the United States Department of the Treasury and United States Department of the Navy. As \"Edisto\" sailed south, U.S. Coast Guard officers boarded who would command the vessel following the turnover.\n\nOn October 20, 1965, \"Edisto\" was transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard and re-designated as USCGC \"Edisto\" (WAGB-284). The icebreaker was decommissioned by the U.S. Navy, transferred, and immediately commissioned by the Coast Guard at Constitution Wharf, U.S. Coast Guard Base in Boston, Massachusetts. The Coast Guard changed \"Edisto\"s hull number to WAGB-284.\n\nHer first mission as a Coast Guard icebreaker came the following month, when a vital undersea defense cable broke near Thule, Greenland. Although she got underway on short notice and steamed far north to join the other Canadian and American icebreakers in the repair operation, \"Edisto\" arrived only to learn that the cable had already been repaired.\n\nAfter her return in early December 1965, \"Edisto\" spent the entire winter in the Bethlehem Steel Shipyard, where she underwent major repairs and alterations. Part of the alterations consisted of installations of a new flight deck with a telescopic hangar to house two helicopters which she would carry. The summer of 1966 saw \"Edisto\" deployed to the Arctic waters off Greenland and Iceland to participate in \"Arctic East Summer\" (AES) operations, which entailed the annual resupply of American bases in the Arctic and the advancement of polar sciences. As in the previous winter, \"Edisto\" was ordered on an unusual winter penetration into northern Baffin Bay.\n\nThe vital undersea cable connecting the remote North American defense outposts with the mainland of the United States had broken again. Reaching the break area on December 12, 1966, the icebreaker braved extreme cold, continual darkness, gale winds, and heavy icing until the break was located and repaired. For their \"extremely meritorious service in support of Coast Guard operations\" during this emergency, \"Edisto\" and her crew were awarded the U.S. Coast Guard Unit Commendation for the period of December 2–22, 1966.\n\nIn 1967, while in company with , \"Edisto\" made an unsuccessful attempt to circumnavigate the Arctic, a feat that would have rivaled the 16th century voyages around the world of Magellan and Drake and has yet to be accomplished by surface vessels of any nation. In 1968 and 1969, \"Edisto\" participated in Antarctic polar deployments in support of operations Deep Freeze 69 and Deep Freeze 70.\n\nIn 1971, as in every summer since she became a U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker, \"Edisto\" took part in \"Arctic East Summer\" (AES) operations. In December 1971, she was temporarily transferred to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to take part in a test, along with of icebreaking operations designed to extend the length of the shipping season on the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway system. In the autumn of 1972, however, \"Edisto\" conducted icebreaking operations off Greenland in concert with the U.S. Navy oceanographic research ship . She was sent there from the Great Lakes after the cutter originally assigned the duty, , suffered an engine casualty; although she remained off Greenland. \"Edisto\" arrived in the Arctic on September 30, 1972 and began escorting \"Mizar\" into the icepack for oceanographic research. At one point, the two were as far as into the heavy ice, some of which was a thick as . In early October 1972, one of the \"Mizar\"s engines went out, so \"Edisto\" took her in tow, intending to take the research vessel out of the ice. On October 6, 1972, \"Mizar\" slipped out of its tow with \"Edisto\" and collided with the icebreaker, doing minor damage to \"Edisto\"s starboard side superstructure. Later, \"Edisto\", due to the heavy ice; lost her starboard propeller and damaged her rudder and starboard shaft.\n\nAlthough \"Mizar\" repaired her engine, the ship could not break ice, so the need for a fully operational icebreaker still existed. U.S. Coast Guard officials, through the U.S. State Department, arranged for the support of Canada's icebreaker , in case \"Southwind\" was unable to free \"Mizar\". \"John A. Macdonald\" sailed from Baffin Bay around the southern tip of Greenland and berthed at Reykjavík, Iceland and awaited the call for assistance.\n\nFortunately, \"Edisto\" managed to work her way through the open leads in the ice while \"Southwind\", with only four of her six engines running was able to reach \"Mizar\", still icebound where it had struck \"Edisto\", and freed her. \"Southwind\" then took \"Edisto\" in tow, and made for Reykjavík. They arrived on October 23, 1972 and \"Edisto\"s crew made temporary repairs to her rudder for the long tow back to the U.S. They departed and headed for the U.S., but the repairs did not hold and they once again returned to Iceland. On November 2, 1972 they once again set sail.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Headquarters decided that \"Southwind\" would take \"Edisto\"s place on the Great Lakes for that season. They were under pressure to get a second icebreaker there before the Welland Canal closed on December 15, 1972. To lessen the impact on the crews, headquarters also determined that the ships would simply exchange their entire crews. \"Southwind\"s crew would take over during the repairs on \"Edisto\" while \"Edisto\"s crew would join \"Southwind\" once she made her new home port of Milwaukee, Wisconsin in preparation for the 1972-1973 winter season.\n\nOn November 10, 1972 rendezvoused with the icebreakers and prepared to take over the tow but severe weather prevented a switch. By November 13, 1972, however, the weather moderated and she took over towing, and set course for Baltimore, Maryland. \"Southwind\" then made her way to the Great Lakes. On November 24, 1972 she rendezvoused with approximately west of the \"Nantucket\" Lightship after first dodging a storm by sailing towards Nova Scotia. \"Chilula\" took over the towing and headed to Hampton Roads, Virginia and then to the Coast Guard Yard, where the two cutters arrived safely on November 30, 1972.\n\nAfter repairs were finished she was homeported in Baltimore, Maryland and used for icebreaking. \"Edisto\"s final cruise was a three-phase \"Arctic East Summer\" (AES) voyage that commenced at Baltimore on July 7, 1974. She first sailed in support of the International Ice Patrol, studying some 35 icebergs of varying sizes and shapes off the west coast of Greenland and the east coast of Baffin Island, Canada. Her crew took aerial, surface, and sonar measurements of bergs to be used by marine scientists to determine their rates of deterioration and drift. As tribute to their wives, some of the crew named the icebergs under study after their loved ones. During the voyage north, \"Edisto\" assisted , a cargo ship that sustained ice damage to her hull off Hamilton Inlet, Labrador.\n\n\"Edisto\" then sailed for Edinburgh, Scotland, arriving August 12, 1974. She departed Edinburgh on August 17, 1974 and headed for the Icelandic Sea for the second phase of her cruise, where she worked in conjunction with the Icelandic government. Her crew took 40 \"Nansen Casts\" in the Icelandic Sea and then, on September 2, 1974, made Reykjavík. \"Edisto\" departed Reykjavík on September 5, 1974 and sailed for the Labrador Sea for the third phase of her cruise. Arriving off Cape Farewell, Greenland on September 8, 1974, her crew took 52 \"STD Casts\" in the Labrador Sea and along the coast of Labrador, Canada. On September 14, 1974 she finished the third phase and began her return journey to Baltimore, arriving there on September 24, 1974.\n\nShe was decommissioned at Baltimore, Maryland on November 14, 1974 and then transferred to the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA). GSA sold \"Edisto\" on September 29, 1977 to Boston Metals Company of Baltimore, Maryland who then sold her for scrap metal to the Union Minerals Company of Carey, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is currently working with the junior players in Saudi Arabia at Al-Shabab.\n\nHe spent the largest portion of his playing career with Everton – with whom he won the FA Cup, European Cup Winners' Cup and two Football League titles – and also played for Hereford United, Liverpool, Newcastle United and Blackpool. Born in Builth Wells, Wales, he played 46 times for the Republic of Ireland national football team and scored the country's first ever goal in a FIFA World Cup finals.\n\nAfter playing for Hereford Lads Club as a boy, Sheedy started his career with Hereford United, followed by a short spell with Liverpool, but played just three competitive games in four years and was sold to Everton for £100,000 in 1982. At Everton he made 357 appearances (12 as substitute) and scored 97 goals.\n\nSheedy's most notable achievements were as part of Everton's title winning teams in 1985 and 1987, and in 1985 the European Cup Winners' Cup, scoring in the final itself. In the 1980s Sheedy scored the most goals from free-kicks in the top-flight of the English football league. Perhaps his most famous free-kick moment came in an FA Cup tie against Ipswich Town in 1985 when he scored with a 19-yard free-kick into goalkeeper Paul Cooper's right-hand corner, but having been forced to re-take the kick, proceeded to curl the ball into the keeper's left-hand corner. He was selected in the PFA Team of the Year in both Everton championship winning years of 1985 and 1987.\n\nSheedy left Goodison Park in 1992 after 10 years on a free transfer to join Newcastle United, and helped them win the Division One title, and promotion to the Premier League, in 1992–93. He ended his career with Blackpool in the 1993–94 Division Two campaign.\n\nAlthough born in Wales, Sheedy held Irish citizenship from birth and chose to play for the Republic of Ireland. His Irish citizenship stemmed form the fact that his father was from County Clare. He played 46 times for Ireland scoring nine goals, including one in a game in the 1990 World Cup against England. Ireland drew all three of their group games to qualify for the last 16 of the tournament, and subsequently beat Romania 5–4 on penalties, Sheedy scoring the first of Ireland's penalties. Ireland went on to lose 1–0 to hosts Italy in the quarter-final of the FIFA World Cup.\n\nSheedy was also part of the Euro 88 squad and played all 3 matches. He is also noted as the first-ever Republic of Ireland player to score a goal in the World Cup finals.\n\nSince retiring from playing, Sheedy has been assistant manager at Tranmere Rovers (and a short spell as joint-caretaker-manager) and Hartlepool United. He joined Everton's coaching staff in July 2006, where he coaches the Academy team.\n\nIn late August 2012 Sheedy was diagnosed with bowel cancer. He revealed to the media that his family had a history of the disease\n\n\n\n\n"}

The film co-stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Dennis Farina, and Tom Sizemore. It was directed by Rowdy Herrington and written by Herrington and Marty Kaplan. The film was shot on location throughout Pittsburgh; its early title was \"Three Rivers\".\n\nPittsburgh homicide detective Thomas Hardy turns in his partner and cousin, Jimmy Detillo, for using excessive force. Thomas and his father Vincent are en route to the Policemen's Ball when a call comes in indicating a serial killer, the Polish Hill Strangler, has been spotted. As Tom and Vince pursue the killer's car, the vehicles collide and both roll down an embankment. When Tom regains consciousness, he learns his father has been shot dead and the killer has escaped. Police arrest a criminal named Douglas Kesser as the Strangler. Later, Jimmy jumps off the 31st Street Bridge; his body is never found.\n\nTwo years later, an alcoholic Tom has been reassigned to the River Rescue Squad. Called to the scene of a body dump, Tom finds the victim is an ex-girlfriend. He is assigned a new partner, Jo Christman, who learns from District Attorney Frank Morris that Tom had been demoted after telling a television reporter that he believed the Strangler was a policeman. After a nurse is abducted, Tom receives a phone call similar to the ones left by the Strangler. Detective Eddie Eiler, who hates Tom for turning in Jimmy, states on TV the murder was committed by a copycat. Tom is met with strong opposition by his uncle, Captain Nick Detillo, after suggesting the Strangler is back. Tom steals the Strangler file from the precinct in order to conduct an unauthorized investigation. Soon after, the body of another of Tom's ex-girlfriends is found.\n\nTom is invited to the Policemen's Ball by Jo, as she is not familiar with any other officers there. A brawl occurs there between Tom and the hostile officers in attendance, but Jo intervenes and takes him home. Later that same night, the two engage in a heated confrontation after Jo pours Tom's whiskey down the sink in an attempt to stop him from drinking. Tom pleads for her to leave, but is shocked when Jo shuts down the suggestion and reveals her desire to make love. They have passionate sex, unaware that they are being watched by someone outside Tom's houseboat.\n\nWhile on patrol, Tom and Jo stumble upon someone dumping what appears to be a wrapped body off a bridge. Tom destroys the suspect's car but the unidentified individual escapes. Divers retrieve the body only to find it to be merely a bunch of rugs, which leads to Tom and Jo being humiliated by their peers. Later that night, Tom and Jo share their suspicions that that the killer purposely dumped the rugs to discredit them. Meanwhile, Eiler informs Nick he suspects Tom of the murders. Nick discloses that Tom has been under scrutiny by Internal Affairs. During a court hearing to have Tom removed from the force, it is revealed Jo's real name is Emily Harper, a Pennsylvania State Police investigator probing Tom for evidence of misconduct. Emily perjures herself and Tom goes free.\n\nEmily is kidnapped from her apartment just as Tom finds the body of another victim (this time a coworker from River Rescue) outside his houseboat. Thinking that Jimmy's cousin Danny has been committing the murders out of revenge, Tom heads upriver to the Detillo family cabin. Just as Danny arrives, someone from behind tases Tom unconscious. Tom awakens to find himself, Danny, and Emily handcuffed to chairs. The killer turns out to be none other than Jimmy, who survived the fall into the river two years earlier. Jimmy is about to kill Emily when Nick suddenly walks in and tells his son to turn himself in. Jimmy instead forces Nick to reveal that he accidentally killed Vince two years earlier.\n\nJimmy shoots Nick and fights with Danny, giving Tom a chance to free himself. As the police close in, Jimmy flees on Tom's motorboat with Tom in pursuit. The two get into a scuffle in which Tom kills Jimmy by tasering him in the mouth. The movie ends with Tom, who has been reinstated as a detective, visiting his father's grave with Emily and her daughter at his side.\n\n\nThe film was cited as one of the many troubled projects during the time Sony Pictures was run by Jon Peters and Peter Guber. It took a huge amount of resources to merely break even.\n\nFilming took 13 weeks in the summer of 1992 in Pittsburgh. The working title was \"Three Rivers,\" and it was scheduled for release on May 21, 1993. But after the original cut was shown to test audiences who hated it, extensive re-shooting was done in Los Angeles, with story changes and removal of some plot points. Because of this, the release date was pushed from May to Sept. 17.\nAccording to articles and reports at the time, test audiences disliked the initial cut of the film largely because they found parts of it confusing. Those parts were added into director Rowdy Herrington's and Marty Kaplan's original script by star Willis. One source claimed the original cut was like \"\"Hudson Hawk\" without the laughs.\"\n\nOne of the veteran production members said that Willis \"called the shots like he did on '(Hudson) Hawk' and like he used to do on 'Moonlighting'. He had scenes rewritten. He did what he wanted to do. We were working with Orson Willis.\"\n\nWhen news about re-shoots were reported, Columbia’s then-current chairman Mark Canton said in an interview that he \"couldn't be more enthusiastic\" about the film, predicting it would be a \"beyond-sizable hit\". But in order to do so, the movie had to make $30 million-plus profit at the box office. Canton was known for being heavily involved in several other films in earlier years that had very troubled productions and received bad receptions from audiences during test screenings. Those include Wes Craven's sci-fi horror film \"Deadly Friend\", one of Willis's earlier box office flops \"The Bonfire of the Vanities\", and John McTiernan's \"Last Action Hero\". Just as he did with \"Striking Distance\", Canton kept the news and rumors about problems on sets of those films and bad responses from test audiences from the public and demanded heavy changes on the films, which only ended up making matters worse.\n\nIn \"Striking Distance\"s case, for example, all the love/intimate scenes between Hardy and Jo were re-shot to make them sexier. Several dialogue scenes, such as the scene in the bar between Willis and Sizemore, were also cut to make the film's pace quicker. The change in tone made Columbia change the title from \"Three Rivers\" to \"Striking Distance\", as it now focused more on the action/thriller elements. Although his interference in the script and huge ego during filming caused problems with the production and the original cut, Willis was still very angry because he had to return for re-shoots, so much so that he blamed Herrington for it, despite the fact that Herrington defended Willis in interviews regarding problems with the film. According to cast and crew, Willis treated Herrington very poorly during both initial filming and re-shoots.\n\nThe theatrical trailer shows a lot of deleted, extended and alternate scenes, probably ones that were cut or changed after bad test screenings of the original cut. There are also many promotional stills that show several other deleted scenes, such as Tom and Jo pulling a man out of the water while a group of people watch them and a deleted shot from the ending, showing Tom kneeling over Nick's body.\n\n\"Striking Distance\" ended up being a box office bomb in the U.S, earning only $24 million on a budget of $30 million.\n\n\"Striking Distance\" received negative reviews from critics; it currently holds a 17% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert rated the film one and a half out of four stars, criticizing the film's cliches (even listing them individually) and stating: \"The credits say \"written by Rowdy Herrington and Martin Kaplan,\" but the right word would have been \"anthologized.\"\" Owen Gleiberman called the film a \"flat, dankly lit, grindingly inept thriller about a serial killer whose victims all turn out to have been acquaintances of Willis' rumpled, alcoholic cop hero.\"\n\n\n\n[[Category:Films shot in Pennsylvania]\n[[Category:Fictional portrayals of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police]]\n[[Category:American action thriller films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Police detective films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American chase films]]\n[[Category:1990s action thriller films]]\n[[Category:American serial killer films]]\n[[Category:Patricide in fiction]]\n[[Category:Fratricide in fiction]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Brad Fiedel]]"}

In 1850, he moved to Plano, Illinois and Iowa and invested in the farmland of the area. In 1856 he returned to Portland, Maine, and in the early 1860s he secured a contract producing uniform coats and pants for the Union Army. This was apparently a successful venture, and after the war Deering opened a dry goods business called Deering, Milliken & Company.\n\nAround 1870, Deering left that business and partnered with Elijah Gammon, providing $40,000 in funding for the production of a horse-drawn grain harvester developed by brothers William and Charles Marsh. By 1872 the company showed $80,000 in profits, and in 1873 the name was changed to Gammon & Deering Co. to reflect Deering's management role. By 1879 Deering was the sole owner and the company's name had been changed to Deering Manufacturing Company.\n\nAlong with the Marsh harvester, the company pioneered a harvesting reaper incorporating an automatic twine binder invented by John Appleby of Beloit, Wisconsin. Deering Manufacturing Company produced and sold 3,000 of Appleby's twine-tie binder for the 1880 harvest, with profits above $400,000. In 1880, Deering moved the company to Chicago and established the Deering Harvester Works.\n\nDeering was also responsible for building a modern twine factory to supply farmers with sufficient length and quality of twine to work with the binders, a move followed by most competitors. He conducted several experiments and determined that the ideal binder twine would be made of manila, spun to 700 feet per pound.\n\nThe Deering Company and the reorganized Plano Harvester Company, which had moved to Pullman, competed aggressively with each other and the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, but in 1902, under his son's direction, all three companies merged to form the International Harvester Company.\n\nWilliam Deering financially supported several institutions of Chicago, the Northwestern University, the Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary, and the Wesley Hospital among them. He gave Northwestern over $1 million over the years, and served on the university's board for 38 years, including 10 years (1895–1905) as president of the board; he declined an offer to rename the school \"Deering University\".\n\nAfter Deering retired in 1901 he spent a large part of each year at his winter home in Coconut Grove, Florida. He died on December 9, 1913 in Coconut Grove with his two sons in attendance. He was the father of Charles Deering (1852–1927) and James Deering (1859–1925). The Deering Library at Northwestern is named for the family. An 1899 portrait of him by Anders Zorn hangs in the library.\n\nWilliam Deering scouted territory in Southeast Missouri for timber in the late 1890, purchasing 60,000 acres of land in Pemiscot and Dunklin Counties. The town Deering is named after him.\n\n"}

The recordings were a group effort with lead vocals by Cymone, Dickerson or Chapman. The project was shelved for unknown reasons, but two of the tracks were later re-recorded and given away by Prince. \"You\", became \"U\", and was released on Paula Abdul's \"Spellbound\" album while \"If I Love U 2nite\" was released by both Mica Paris and Prince's later wife, Mayte Garcia. Paris rerecorded the song from scratch. Garcia's version was rerecorded by Prince.\n\nOn the next two tours following the Prince Tour, the band underwent two line-up changes. Gayle Chapman, quit the band in 1980. The end came when she told Prince she needed more musical fulfillment and growth for herself, but Prince wanted her to commit to some short-noticed rehearsals instead. After a long conversation, Chapman quit the group to be replaced by Lisa Coleman.\n\nThe following year, after the Dirty Mind Tour, bass guitarist André Cymone would leave the band. Cymone, whose family gave Prince a home after he left his father's house, left over a number of grievances with Prince—little input in the studio, he wasn't getting credit for his contributions to Prince's music, and in general his desire to start his own career—and would have bitter feelings toward Prince as he later claimed that Prince stole many of his ideas that were used for the Time and that he created the bassline for \"Controversy\"s \"Do Me, Baby\". Ultimately, Cymone was replaced by Mark Brown, renamed Brownmark by Prince. Coleman was usually only identified by her first name, while Fink started wearing surgical scrubs on stage and became known as \"Doctor\" Fink. Fink originally wore a black- and white-striped prison jumpsuit. However, a member of Rick James' band was doing the same thing and not wanting to copy that, Prince asked Fink, \"Do you have any other ideas?\" Fink said, \"What about a doctor's outfit?\" Prince loved the idea, and thus was born Doctor Fink.\n\nFrom 1982–1983, when the band was almost identified as the Revolution, it consisted of:\n\n\nThe words \"and the Revolution\" can be seen printed backwards on the cover of his fifth album \"1999\". The band members were curious as to if they were getting a real name, but Prince had held back from fully calling the group the Revolution partly because of Dez Dickerson's wishes to leave the band. When the 1999 Tour ended, Dez Dickerson finally left the band for religious reasons and was replaced by Lisa's childhood friend Wendy Melvoin. Prince told Dickerson that he needed three years from him, and Dickerson wasn't willing to commit. Prince told Dickerson he'd leave him on payroll and honor his contract, which Prince did. Dickerson went on to eventually work for independent Christian record label Star Song. Wendy and Lisa shortly thereafter formed a special bond with Prince and greatly influenced his output during the rest of their tenure in the band. Prince's former mostly R&B/funk offerings would be more diversified with rock, pop and classical music elements.\n\nPrince and The Revolution's best-selling album, \"Purple Rain\", produced by Prince and The Revolution themselves, peaked at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 knocking Bruce Springsteen's \"Born in the U.S.A.\" from the number one spot. Released at the end of June 1984, the album featured the singles \"When Doves Cry\", \"Let's Go Crazy\", \"Purple Rain\", \"I Would Die 4 U\", and \"Take Me with U\". All the singles had accompanying music videos (all of which included clips from their relative scenes in the movie) and all charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, but the first four peaked within the top 10 while \"When Doves Cry\" and \"Let's Go Crazy\" topped the chart. \"When Doves Cry\" would become the most successful single from \"Purple Rain\" at the time of its release on the pop charts, reaching number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 as well as the Dance and R&B chart.\n\nThe song \"Purple Rain\" won two Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Instrumental Composition Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television. The album spent 24 weeks at number one and would eventually be certified thirteen times platinum in the United States, six times platinum in Canada and two times platinum in the United Kingdom. \"Purple Rain\" would become the first official appearance of The Revolution. At the time of the release the band contained:\n\n\nThey lasted as such through 1986's Hit n Run – Parade Tour. In 1985, members of the then soon-to-be-defunct R&B/pop group The Family (which, in turn, included former members of another disbanded Prince-associated group, The Time) joined The Revolution, along with people from Sheila E.'s band. The \"Counter-Revolution\" line-up:\n\n\nFor the Hit n Run – Parade Tour, the augmented Revolution with its several new members began to perform the jazzy arrangements from the album, including the horn sections.\n\n\n\n\"Dream Factory\" was an unreleased double LP project recorded by Prince and The Revolution in 1986. The album morphed into \"Sign o' the Times\" following the dissolution of The Revolution.\n\nPrince did not want to see his band anymore and The Revolution were not happy with Prince's decision to include new band members on the scene. In a 2017 direct-to-YouTube interview (on Yahoo's account), Wendy Melvoin remembers Prince rehearsing with all his new selections, and ignoring The Revolution by not looking at them. Brownmark, Wendy and Lisa threatened to quit. At one point, Prince dispatched Bobby Z. to the airport and literally caught Melvoin and Coleman before they boarded. Eventually all three were convinced to ride it out. Prince promised Brownmark a lot of money, but Brownmark settled for $3000 a week, a paltry sum based on other touring bands. He turned down a much more lucrative gig as bassist for Stevie Nicks, who was going on tour at that time. Brown has said that Prince never followed through on \"all that money\". But as the tour ended, on the final night in Yokohama, Japan, Prince smashed up all of his guitars after a final encore of \"Purple Rain\". Wendy looked round at the other members and she whispered (and they agreed),\"It's over!\".\n\nShortly after the Parade Tour in October 1986, after all the tension between Prince, Wendy Melvoin, and Coleman due to his relationship with Susannah Melvoin, Prince invited Wendy Melvoin and Coleman to dinner at his rented Beverly Hills home and fired them both. Unhappy with their lack of credit and creativity, Wendy & Lisa went on to perform as a duo. Susannah ended up leaving the Revolution too, following a hurtful breakup with Prince, and performed for a time with Wendy & Lisa as a backup singer in their band.\n\nHe then called Bobby Z. to tell him that he was being replaced by the more versatile Sheila E, although he was kept on payroll for quite a few years after the fact, honoring Z's contract. Bobby Z would release a solo album in 1989.\n\nBrownmark was asked to stay but quit. Although he said it was \"partly out of loyalty to the others\" and also because he was \"unhappy with the direction of Prince's music at the time\", it was probably so he could concentrate on his burgeoning career as a solo artist and as a record producer for himself and other artists.\n\nMatt Fink remained with Prince until 1991, when similar to the exit of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis from The Time, Matt Fink told Prince he wasn't available for two dates at the Rock in Rio festival, as he was busy producing for another band at the time, and found himself replaced by Tommy Barbarella. However, Fink also stated in a 2001 interview that he was tired of being in the band. When Prince filmed \"Graffiti Bridge\", Prince wanted Fink to \"rehearse the band\" and was told that \"there wasn't really anywhere in the movie for him.\" After the ensuing Nude Tour, essentially a greatest hits-type tour, Fink left for a career writing music for video games, and working at K-Tel Records, based out of Minneapolis. Unlike his bandmates Fink did not immediately release any solo material, an album not being released until 2001.\n\nIn 2000 there was rumor of a reunion and a new album called \"Roadhouse Garden\", but Prince scrapped the plans after Wendy & Lisa backed out of the project. Prince asked Wendy & Lisa to come to Minneapolis to finish \"Roadhouse Garden\". They asked that Prince pay for their hotel and expenses while in Minneapolis, and Prince refused. Not wanting to spend all their own money on a Prince project, they declined to work on the album. Prince would later tell people to \"ask Wendy & Lisa\", when asked about the status of \"Roadhouse Garden\".\n\nMini-reunions of The Revolution have taken place in several forms over the past decade.\n\nIn 2000, Prince had a celebration concert in his hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and asked if any former bandmates wished to perform. Dr. Fink, Bobby Z. and Brown Mark appeared and joined Prince on stage to perform the song \"America\".\n\nOn December 13, 2003, Sheila E. organized a concert for charity known as the 1st Annual Family Jamm which featured several of Prince's protégés, including the entire Revolution, without Prince. They played six songs including \"Mountains\", \"Purple Rain\", and \"Baby I'm a Star\". That next year, Wendy Melvoin performed a live rendition of \"Musicology\" track \"Reflection\" with Prince on Tavis Smiley's PBS television program.\n\nAt the 2006 BRIT Awards, a somewhat reformed Revolution once again backed Prince, as he reunited with Wendy, Lisa and Sheila E., while also featuring former New Power Generation member Morris Hayes and played \"Te Amo Corazón\" (from Prince's \"3121\" album), \"Fury\" (also from \"3121\"), \"Purple Rain\", and \"Let's Go Crazy\". Sheila E. played drums only on \"Purple Rain\", playing percussion for the rest of the songs.\n\nOn February 19, 2012, The Revolution (sans Prince) performed a reunion/benefit concert in Minneapolis at First Avenue, where the \"Purple Rain\" movie was filmed.\n\nFollowing the sudden death of group founder Prince on April 21, 2016, The Revolution announced that they were getting back together as a band. As of 2018, they continue to perform Prince's songs live.\n\nThe Revolution has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\" according to journalist Steve Marsh. The band's star is located to the immediate right of Prince's own star on the mural.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2130947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2130947", "title": "Charley Trippi", "text": "Charley Trippi\n\nCharles Louis Trippi (born December 14, 1921) is a former American football player. He played professionally for the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) from 1947 to 1955. Although primarily a running back, his versatility allowed him to fill a multitude of roles over his career, including quarterback, defensive back, punter, and return specialist. A \"quintuple-threat\", Trippi was adept at running, catching, passing, punting, and defense.\n\nTrippi attended the University of Georgia, where he played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs from 1942 to 1946, with an interlude in 1944 while serving in the military during World War II. As a sophomore, he guided Georgia to victory in the 1943 Rose Bowl and was named the game's most valuable player. As a senior in 1946, he won the Maxwell Award as the nation's most outstanding college football player, was named the Southeastern Conference's player of the year, and earned unanimous first-team All-America recognition.\n\nDrafted first overall by the Cardinals as a \"future pick\" in the 1945 NFL Draft, Trippi was also pursued by the New York Yankees of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) as well as multiple professional baseball teams. He ultimately signed a record $100,000 contract with the Cardinals. As a rookie, Trippi led Chicago's \"Million Dollar Backfield\" to victory in the 1947 NFL Championship Game. By the time he retired he had compiled the most yards of total offense by a player in NFL history. Trippi was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1959 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1968.\n\nTrippi is the oldest living member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the oldest living first overall NFL draft pick, and one of the oldest living former American football players.\n\nCharles Louis Trippi was born to an Italian immigrant father on December 14, 1921, in Pittston, Pennsylvania, a coal-mining community. Seeking to avoid the dangers of a life mining coal like his father, Trippi turned to sports. He began his football career as a tailback for the Red and White of Pittston High school panthers which in 1967 became Pittston Area patriots with the merger of Avoca, Dupont and Duryea schools. He also played semi-professional baseball while in high school.\n\nConsidered undersized at 160 pounds, Trippi was turned down by four colleges before being recruited to play for the University of Georgia by Georgia alum Harold \"War Eagle\" Ketron. He was given a scholarship and played for the Georgia Bulldogs football varsity team from 1942 to 1946, with an interlude in 1944 due to World War II. As a sophomore in 1942, he played alongside that season's Heisman Trophy winner Frank Sinkwich. That year, Trippi and Sinkwich led Georgia to a 75–0 win over rival Florida, a game in which Trippi threw a touchdown pass to end George Poschner, scored two rushing touchdowns, and on defense returned an interception for a touchdown. Georgia finished the season with a record of 11–1 and was named the consensus national champion. Trippi then guided Georgia to a 9–0 victory over UCLA in the 1943 Rose Bowl, in which he carried 27 times for 115 yards and also handled passing and punting duties. He was retroactively named the game's most valuable player when the award was created in 1953.\n\nTrippi's college career was interrupted by World War II, causing him to miss the 1944 season and all but six games in 1945. He played for the 1944 Third Air Force Gremlins football team and was selected as a first-team back on the Associated Press' 1944 Service All-America team. While in the service in 1945, he was drafted by the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League as a future pick; per an agreement with Cardinals owner Charles Bidwill, Trippi was allowed to return to Georgia after his time in the military.\n\nDespite missing Georgia's first five games of the 1945 season, Trippi was named a first-team All-Southeastern Conference back by both the Associated Press (AP) and United Press International (UPI). He threw a 54-yard touchdown pass and returned a punt 69 yards for a touchdown in Georgia's 20–6 win over Tulsa in the Oil Bowl on New Years Day. In 1946, Trippi led Georgia to its first undefeated season. Against rival Georgia Tech in the final game of that year, Trippi compiled 544 combined yards rushing, passing, and returning kicks, and scored three touchdowns in Georgia's 35–7 victory. Georgia then defeated North Carolina 20–10 in the Sugar Bowl, where Trippi carried 14 times for 54 yards and threw a 67-yard touchdown pass to end Dan Edwards. After the season, Trippi was given the Maxwell Award as the most outstanding college player in the nation, the Walter Camp Memorial Trophy as the nation's best back, and was a unanimous choice for the All-America team. He finished as runner-up in Heisman Trophy voting behind winner Glenn Davis of Army.\n\nDue to relaxed regulations during WWII years, Trippi holds the unusual distinction of participating in the Chicago College All-Star Game a record five times: twice with Georgia, twice in the military, and once with the Cardinals. He was named the Most Valuable Player of the game in 1945. It was at the Chicago College All-Star Game that Bidwell decided he would draft Trippi first overall, as \"Card-Pitt\" was winless in 1944 and in need of a play-maker. \"He said, 'I'm gonna get ya,'\" Trippi recalled. \"He wanted me to play for him, and I said, 'All you've got to do is draft me and I'm ready.'\"\n\nIn addition to football, Trippi was highly sought-after for his baseball skills. As a senior on Georgia's baseball team in 1946, he recorded a batting average of .475 and hit 11 home runs in 30 games while playing as a shortstop and outfielder. In 1947, Trippi played one season of minor league baseball with the Southern Association's Atlanta Crackers. He recorded a batting average of .334 through 106 games while drawing large crowds. Multiple Major League Baseball teams attempted to sign him, including the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Boston Braves, and Philadelphia Phillies, but those deals fell through when he joined the NFL. Between NFL seasons in 1948 and 1949, Trippi served as Georgia's baseball coach, compiling a 34–18 win–loss record.\n\nTrippi was a major part in the battling between the NFL and All-America Football Conference (AAFC). The 26-year-old rookie had plenty of leverage as a star commodity, and so weighed his options: the Cardinals and the AAFC's New York Yankees. The Yankees were sure they had signed Trippi to a joint deal that included a contract with the Yankees of MLB, but Cardinals owner Charles Bidwill signed Trippi to a four-year contract worth an unprecedented $100,000 along with a first-year bonus of $25,000. The contract was considered the most lucrative in pro football history. Trippi felt the NFL was more established and stable, and Bidwill had offered him job security.\n\nTrippi's addition completed Bidwill's \"Dream Backfield\". Although Bidwill did not live to see it, Trippi became the game breaker in a talented corps that included Paul Christman, Pat Harder, Marshall Goldberg and, later, Elmer Angsman. Trippi served a multitude of roles for the Cardinals as a rookie: in 11 games, he rushed 83 times for 401 yards, caught 23 passes for 240 yards, averaged 43.4 yards on 13 punts, returned eight punts for 181 yards and 15 kickoffs for 321 yards, and on defense returned an interception 59 yards for a touchdown. The Cardinals compiled nine wins and three losses and faced the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1947 NFL Championship Game, which the Cardinals won 28–21 largely due to a spectacular all-around performance by Trippi. Playing on an icy field in Chicago, Trippi wore basketball shoes for better traction and totaled 206 yards, including 102 yards with two punt returns. He scored touchdowns on a 44-yard run and a 75-yard punt return. During the punt return, he twice escaped an encirclement of tacklers and fell to his knees near midfield before cutting to the outside and sprinting for the score. Trippi was named to the 1947 All-Pro second team backfield by the United Press.\n\nTrippi led the NFL in all-purpose yards in both 1948 and 1949, compiling 1,485 and 1,552 respectively. His 5.4 rushing yards per carry in 1948 also led the league, as did his two punt return touchdowns. He had a 45-yard punt return touchdown against the Green Bay Packers and later returned a punt 67 yards for a touchdown against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Trippi was a first-team All-Pro selection for 1948 by the AP, UPI, \"New York Daily News\", and \"The Sporting News\", among others. The Cardinals returned to the championship game in 1948, and this time were shutout by the Eagles for a 7–0 loss. Trippi was held to nine carries for only 26 yards during the game, which was played in a heavy snowstorm. Trippi saw heavy use as a receiver in 1949; in addition to rushing for 554 yards, he led the Cardinals in receptions (32) and receiving touchdowns (six) and was second on the team with 412 receiving yards.\n\nAfter playing as a left halfback for his first four seasons, Trippi switched to quarterback during 1951 and 1952. On December 15, 1951, on frozen turf in Wrigley Field, Trippi completed nine passes for 106 yards and carried 11 times for 145 yards, accounting for three touchdowns as the Cardinals defeated the Bears 24–14. Following the 1952 season, he was invited to the Pro Bowl as a backup quarterback for the American Conference. Trippi moved back to offensive halfback for one season and again was invited to the Pro Bowl. He then switched over to play defense in 1954, recording three pass interceptions as a defensive back. He also became the Cardinals' primary punter for 1953 and 1954, and had a career punting average of over 40 yards per punt. His career essentially ended in the 1955 preseason when he was tackled by John Henry Johnson of the San Francisco 49ers, which left Trippi with a smashed nose, a concussion, and a protruding bone behind his eye that gave him double vision. He appeared in only five games that season and did not record any statistics on offense. Trippi retired on December 13, 1955, a day before his 33rd birthday. At the time, his 6,053 yards of total offense (3,506 rushing, 2,547 passing, and 1,321 receiving) was the most by a player in NFL history, and he had compiled the fourth-most all-purpose yards of any player (7,148).\n\nAfter he ended his playing career, Trippi served as an assistant coach with the Cardinals from 1957 to 1965, mostly coaching the offensive backfield. He later took up a business in real estate. Trippi was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1959; the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1965; and the Pro Football Hall of Fame and Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 1968. He is the only player in the Pro Hall of Fame to have accumulated at least 1,000 yards each receiving, passing, and rushing. In 2007, he was ranked 20th on ESPN's list of the top 25 players in college football history. The football stadium at Pittston Area High School is named Charley Trippi Stadium in his honor. In 1969, Trippi was named to the NFL's 1940s All-Decade Team, compiled to honor the best players of the decade. As of 2018, Trippi is the oldest living member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, as well as the oldest living No. 1 NFL draft pick.\n\n"}

It is the capital of the comarca of Baix Llobregat, and the see of a bishopric since June 2005.\n\nSant Feliu is situated in the valley of the river Llobregat, and goes up to Parc de Collserola. The closest mountains to the city, which belong to the Serra de Collserola, are the Puig d'Olorda (436.4 m), the Penya del Moro (375 m), the Puig Aguilar (387 m) and the Puig Sant Pere Màrtir (389 m). The Riera de la Salut flows from the mountains through the city and ends in the Llobregat river, it is usually dry as it only carries water after heavy rain.\n\n\nPaleolithic remains found in the Can Albareda area show a prehistoric human presence. Iberian and Roman traces remain, for instance in the town square.\n\nIn Roman times and during part of the Middle Ages, the place was called Titian and Micano Tiano. The name Sant Feliu does not appear until 1002 in a document in the monastery of Sant Cugat del Vallès. The name originally applied to a chapel dedicated to Saint Feliu (Catalan for Felix). The church of Sant Llorenç (Catalan for Lawrence) was built in 1524 (destroyed in the Civil War and since rebuilt). Until then, Sant Feliu depended on the parishes of Sant Just Desvern and Sant Joan Despí.\nIn the seventeenth century, Jaime Falguera built a palace in the town, with extensive grounds stretching to the river Llobregat. Until recently the property remained in the family of the Marquis of Castellbell, noble descendants of Falguera, and the palace was used into the twentieth century. Today the municipality owns the palace and what is left of the gardens. The National Rose Show is held there each May. The stables preserve a carriage of the Castellbell family.\n\nIn 1855 a railway line was built linking Barcelona and Vilafranca with a station at Sant Feliu. The town market was built in 1885.\n\nSteam-driven textile factories came early to the town: Bertrand (1861) and Solà and Sert (1893) are the most important firms today. But the heavy industrialisation of the town and its region came with the twentieth century introduction of electricity.\n\nRose growing has been an important industry in Sant Feliu since the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\nKing Alfonso XIII made Sant Feliu a city in 1929 and in 1936 it became the capital of Baix Llobregat.\n\nDuring the Civil War place names with monarchist or religious meaning were removed. The people of Sant Feliu became \"Roses del Llobregat\" in acknowledgement of the history of rose growing in the area by such families as Dot and Camprubí. Nationalist forces occupied the Barcelona area in February 1939.\n\nIn 1948 the Falange set up San Feliu Youth Radio, which despite its origins came to enjoy a certain independence. After a brief crisis it reopened in 1981 as Ràdio Sant Feliu.\n\nIn 1999 a new Dot and Camprubí Rose Garden was planted to celebrate the work of Pedro Dot and other Spanish rose breeders.

Although many similar cookbooks had been published by then, amongst others Sophie Wilhelmine Scheibler's \"Allgemeines deutsches Kochbuch für bürgerliche Haushaltungen\" in several editions, Davidis' \"Praktisches Kochbuch\" (Practical Cookbook) became the reference cookbook of the late 19th and early 20th century, a standard in German households. The large number of second-hand copies still available, frequently heavily annotated, are proof that the books were in much use. In many families \"Praktisches Kochbuch\" was handed down through the generations.\n\nHowever the cookbook was only one facet of the extensive educational program Davidis devised for young women. Starting with the \"Puppenköchin\" (Dolls' Cook) for very young girls on to young unmarried women, and finally housewives responsible for their own household and servants, Davidis' books offered advice and information. This was rooted in the conviction that being a housewife was a demanding activity in its own right for which young women of the middle class emerging at the time were frequently ill-prepared.\n\nWhile authoring her books Davidis first worked as a home economist, teacher, and governess, but later on concentrated exclusively on writing. Although her books, in particular \"Praktisches Kochbuch\" which had reached its 21st edition when she died, were hugely successful even during her lifetime, she had to live very modestly and only at the age of 74 years was able to afford her own flat. Occasionally sources claim \"Henriette Davidis\" to be the pseudonym used by a certain Helena Clemen. However Helena Clemen was one of Davidis' readers who had sent in suggestions which the author used in her writings.\n\nToday the Henriette-Davidis-Museum in Wetter-Wengern keeps her memory alive with cookbook exhibitions and a monograph series. Parts of a stone-built stove from the Wengern vicary together with a memorial plaque were bricked in the local railway bridge abutments, completed in 1934 and for which the vicary had to be demolished.\nDue to her huge influence on German food culture and household management she is generally considered to be the German equivalent to Mrs Beeton. The first edition of her classic cookbook \"Praktisches Kochbuch für die gewöhnliche und feinere Küche\" was published in 1844 and there were at least seventy-six editions published by 1963.\n\nDavidis was born in 1801 in Westfalen, Wengern on the Ruhr river, today a part of the town of Wetter (Ruhr), as the tenth of thirteen children of the vicar Ernst Heinrich Davidis and his Dutch wife Maria Katharina Litthauer. Ernst Heinrich Davidis had been ordained in 1780 in Amsterdam, had been working for nine years as a garrison's preacher in the Dutch town of Breda before accepting a posting as assistant vicar in Wengern. In 1792 he took over the vicarage.\n\nFollowing her confirmation Henriette in 1816 left her parents' house and moved in with her older sister Elisabeth who lived in Schwelm and was married to the lord of the manor of Haus Martfeld. For two years she attended the private girls' college in Schwelm, before returning to her parents in 1818 and changing to another private girls' college. Later on she moved to Bommern to live with her sister Albertine, helping with the running of their estate and the upbringing of Albertine's four children. When her father died in 1828 she returned to Wengern to look after her mother until her death in 1838. Following this she accompanied a sick gentlewoman on a trip to Switzerland before taking residence in Windheim around 1840.\n\nFrom 1841 till 1848 Davidis worked at Haus Heine in Sprockhövel as a teacher at a free, so-called \"working school\". During that time her \"Praktisches Kochbuch. Zuverlässige und selbstgeprüfte Recepte der gewöhnlichen und feineren Küche\" (Practical Cookbook. Reliable and self-tested Recipes for the ordinary and refined Kitchen) was published, followed in 1847 and 1848 by \"Arrangements zu kleinen und größeren Gesellschaften\" and \"Praktische Anweisung zur Bereitung des Roßfleisches\" (Arrangements for smaller and larger parties/Practical instruction for the preparation of horse meat), both later merged into \"Praktisches Kochbuch\". For \"Praktisches Kochbuch\" Davidis had been doing substantial research and collected recipes for a long time.\n\nAfter her time in Sprockhövel Henriette Davidis worked in Bremen as a teacher and governess. In 1855 she moved back in with her sister Albertine in Bommern, staying until 1857. During those years she seems to have decided, possibly inspired by the cookbook's success, to write a more comprehensive home economics manual, in addition merely a book of recipes, as well as educational essays for young girls and women. In 1850 \"Der Gemüsegarten\" (the vegetable garden) was published as part I of a planned \"Vollständiges Haushaltsbuch\" (complete household book), in the same year she also composed an unpublished book on sick-nursing, 1856 followed \"Puppenköchin Anna\" (doll cook Anna), 1857 \"Die Jungfrau\" (the virgin) und 1858 \"Puppenmutter Anna\" (doll mother Anna). The planned multi-volume home economics manual was never completed. In 1861, after a volume of poems and novella, \"Die Hausfrau. Praktische Anleitung zur selbständigen und sparsamen Führung des Haushaltes\" (the housewife. Practical instruction for self-reliant and economical housekeeping), which was the final volume in her educational program for young housewives.\n\nDavidis moved to Dortmund in May 1857 where she first lived as a lodger before renting her own flat. Finally she seemed to be able to make a living from her publications. Besides working on \"Jungfrau\" and \"Hausfrau\" she revised earlier works which sold well, for revised new editions. From the 1860s on Davidis, by now surely a recognized authority on home economics, also contributed on a regular basis to magazines such as \"Daheim,\" a publication modelled on the immensely popular magazine \"Gartenlaube\" directed at a bourgeois middle class audience and published from 1865 till 1944. During this time Davidis also published two smaller pamphlets: \"Diätetik für Hausfrauen. Die Gesundheits- und Krankenpflege im Hause …\" (Dietary guide for housewives. The healthcare and nursing at home) and \"Kraftküche von Liebig’s Fleischextract für höhere und unbemittelte Verhältnisse\" (strength cookery of Liebig's meat extract for higher and penniless circumstances). The latter was a promotional brochure commissioned by the Liebig company which cleverly combined praise for the newly developed Liebig meat extract with Davidis’ expert stamp of approval.\n\n\n\n"}

Usually known as Maler Müller (i.e. Painter Müller).\n\nMüller was born in Kreuznach. He showed a talent for art in his youth, and studied painting at Zweibrücken, where his personality and varied endowments won him the favor of court circles. At 18, he published several collections of etchings which attracted much attention with their originality. In 1774-1775, he settled in Mannheim, where he soon acquired a reputation as a poet. In 1777 he was appointed court painter.\n\nIn 1778 he was enabled by a public subscription to visit Italy, which remained his home for the rest of his life. In 1780 he became a Roman Catholic. He was unfavourably influenced by the study of Italian models, and gradually became estranged from painting through failures and distress. He devoted himself instead to the study of the history of art. He became a sort of ambulant antiquary, and his services as cicerone were especially in demand among German visitors to Rome.\n\nBefore he left Mannheim he had tried his hand at literature, under the influence of the Sturm und Drang movement. In 1775, he published several idylls: \"Satyr Mopsus\", \"Der Faun\", \"Bacchidon und Milon\", \"Der erschlagene Abel\" and \"Die Schafschur\". In form and content, these were closely modeled on the works of Solomon Gessner. In 1778 came \"Adam's First Awaking and First Happy Nights\" (\"Adams erstes Erwachen\"; 2nd revised edition, 1779). A lyric drama of the same year, \"Niobe\" (1778), attracted little attention, but \"Faust's Leben dramatisiert\" (\"Faust's Life Dramatized\") (1778) appealed to the turbulent spirit of the time, and \"Golo und Genoveva\" (begun in 1776, but not published until 1801) was an excellent imitation of Goethe's \"Götz von Berlichingen\".\n\nIn his idylls, notably \"Die Schafschur\" and \"Das Nusskernen\" (1811), he struck out a more independent path. In these, emancipating himself from the artificiality of Gessner, he realistically reproduced scenes from the German peasant life of his day, not without a touch of satire. His later idylls took Voss as a model.\n\nMaler Müller's \"Werke\" appeared in 3 vols. (1811–1825); in 1868 H. Hettner published two volumes of \"Dichtungen von Maler Müller\", which contain most of his writings. \"Gedichte von Maler Friedrich Müller; eine Nachlese zu dessen Werken\" appeared in 1873, and his \"Fausts Leben\" was reprinted by B. Seuffert in 1881.\n\nThrough the patronage of the Crown Prince of Bavaria (afterwards King Louis I), he was enabled to pass his declining years in comparative ease. He died in Rome in 1825.\n\n\nAttribution\n\n"}

It was an independent institution for legal education, unaffiliated with any college or university. It was created by Tapping Reeve, who took his first student in 1774 and had begun teaching by lecture by 1784; Reeve later became the Chief Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court. By the time the school closed in 1833, over 1,100 students had attended the institution, including Aaron Burr and John C. Calhoun. (The first university law school in the United States is William & Mary Law School, established in 1779. According to the timeline on their website, \"After decades of disagreement, William & Mary is now acknowledged as the first university-affiliated law school, and Litchfield as the first proprietary (independent) law school.\")\n\nThe law school, including Reeve's house, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965 as the Tapping Reeve House and Law School. The Tapping Reeve House and Law School are owned and operated by the Litchfield Historical Society as a museum displaying life in a 19th-century period school.\n\nThe Society also operates the Litchfield History Museum. There is no admission fee.\n\nReeve was born on Long Island, New York in 1744. He graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1763, serving for seven years as a tutor at the Grammar School that was connected with the college. There he met the children of the Princeton College's president, Aaron Burr, Sr.: Aaron Burr, Jr. (later Vice President of the United States) and Sally Burr, who were both his students.\n\nTapping Reeve moved to Connecticut and studied law under Judge Jesse Root of Hartford, and was admitted to the bar in 1772. In the same year he married his former student, Sally Burr. They then moved to Litchfield and Reeve started his own law practice. Tapping Reeve built his six-room Litchfield house in 1773 and settled in with his frail wife. In 1780 he added a downstairs wing for Sally, who found it difficult to climb stairs.\n\nIn addition to practicing law, Reeve trained a number of prospective attorneys, including Aaron Burr, his brother in law. Students lived in the homes of town residents and traveled to Reeve's house on South Street to receive their morning lectures on the common law in Reeve's downstairs parlor. In 1784, he decided to formalize his program of instruction by creating a law school and built a one-room school building adjacent to his house. James Gould became Reeve's associate when Reeve was elected to the Supreme Court in 1798. Reeve withdrew in 1820 and Gould continued until 1833. The school's lectures covered the entire body of the law including real estate, rights of persons, rights of things, contracts, torts, evidence, pleading, crimes, and equity.\n\nThe list of students who attended Tapping Reeve's law school includes two Vice Presidents of the United States (Aaron Burr and John C. Calhoun), 101 members of the United States House of Representatives, 28 United States senators, six United States cabinet secretaries, three justices of the United States Supreme Court, 14 state governors and 13 state supreme court chief justices. Litchfield Law School students also held state and local political office and became business leaders. Students went on to found university law schools and become university presidents.

{"id": "2131094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2131094", "title": "Medieval India", "text": "Medieval India\n\nMedieval India refers to a long period of the history of the Indian subcontinent between the \"ancient period\" and \"modern period\". It encompasses the 6th to the 18th centuries A.D.\n\nOne definition, used in the rest of this article, includes the period from the 6th century, the \"first half of the 7th century\", or the 8th century up to the 16th century, essentially coinciding with the Middle Ages of Europe. It may be divided into two periods: The 'early medieval period' which lasted from the 6th to the 13th century and the 'late medieval period' which lasted from the 13th to the 16th century, ending with the start of the Mughal Empire in 1526. The Mughal era, from the 16th century to the 18th century, is often referred to as the early modern period, but is sometimes also included in the 'late medieval' period.\n\nAn alternative definition, often seen in those more recent authors who still use the term at all, brings the start of the medieval period forward, either to about 1000 CE, or to the 12th century. The end may be pushed back to the 18th century, making the period in effect that between the start of Muslim domination (at least in northern India) and British India. Or the \"early medieval\" period as beginning in the 8th century, and ending with the 11th century.\n\nThe use of \"medieval\" at all as a term for periods in Indian history has often been objected to, and is probably becoming more rare (there is a similar discussion in terms of the history of China). It is argued that neither the start nor the end of the period really mark fundamental changes in Indian history, comparable to the European equivalents. Burton Stein still used the concept in his \"A History of India\" (1998, referring to the period from the Guptas to the Mughals), but most recent authors using it are Indian. Understandably, they often specify the period they cover within their titles.\n\nThe start of the period is typically taken to be the slow collapse of the Gupta Empire from about 480 to 550, ending the \"classical\" period, as well as \"ancient India\", although both these terms may be used for periods with widely different dates, especially in specialized fields such as the history of art or religion. Another alternative for the preceding period is \"Early Historical\" strectching \"from the sixth century BC to the sixth century AD\", according to Romila Thapar. \n\nAt least in northern India, there was no larger state until perhaps the Delhi Sultanate, or certainly the Mughal Empire, but there were several different dynasties ruling large areas for long periods, as well as many other dynasties ruling smaller areas, often paying some form of tribute to larger states. John Keay puts the typical number of dynasties within the subcontinent at any one time at between 20 and 40, not including local rajas. \n\nFollowing the Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent and the decline of Buddhism were seen to be taken place, eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate and creating the Indo-Islamic architecture, followed by the world's major trading nation Bengal Sultanate.\n\n\nThe start of the Mughal Empire in 1526 marked the beginning of the early modern period of Indian history, often referred to as the Mughal era. Sometimes, the Mughal era is also referred to as the 'late medieval' period.\n\n\nModern historical works written on Medieval India have received some criticism from scholars studying the historiography of the period. E. Sreedharan argues that, after Indian independence up until the 1960s, Indian historians were often motivated by Indian nationalism. Peter Hardy notes that the majority of modern historical works on Medieval India up until then were written by British and Hindu historians, whereas the work of modern Muslim historians was under-represented. However, he argues that some of the modern Muslim historiography on Medieval India at the time was motivated by Islamic apologetics, attempting to justify \"the life of medieval Muslims to the modern world.\"\n\nRam Sharan Sharma has criticised the simplistic manner in which Indian history is often divided into an ancient \"Hindu\" period, a medieval \"Muslim\" period, and a modern \"British\" period. He argues that there is no clear sharp distinction between when the ancient period ended and when the medieval period began, noting dates ranging from the 7th century to the 13th century.\n\n\n\n"}

Scene historian Peter Jandreus describes the group as the most famous Swedish punk band of the 1977–87 era.\n\nTheir name is taken from the Swedish pest control company with the same name, the name of this company, in turn, comes from the Latin name of a particular type of bedbug; \"Cimex\".\n\nFormed in 1981, the original line-up was: Jonsson - Bass, Nillen - Vocals, Charlie - Drums, Jocke - Guitar. Jonsson was, for a time, bassist in the Shitlickers, another early Swedish d-beat band. After rehearsing for a while, they released their first 7\" EP \"Anarkist Attack\". In 1982 they kicked out Nillen. Jonsson took over the vocals part, and Conrad took over the bass playing. The next 7\" EP, called \"Raped Ass\", was released in 1983. This work is considered one of the most severe in the history of hardcore. In 1984 they released another 7\" EP, \"Victims Of A Bomb Raid\". In 1986 they released a mini-Lp (12\") called \"Criminal Trap\". (This 12\" is also included as a bonus on the \"Absolut Country of Sweden\" CD). At this time Jocke had got tired of the band and they asked Cliff if he wanted to join the band but he said no, and the rest of the band members got tired of the problems and it resulted in the band splitting up. \n\nIn 1990 they decided to start the band again after Cliff had agreed to join, and they say that it's thanks to him that they regrouped. They released the comeback album \"Absolut Country Of Sweden\" the same year. In 1993 they released a raw live album \"Made In Sweden\". The show was also shot on video but never released. They later released a new live 7\" single \"Fucked In Finland\" and later on they released the album \"Scandinavian Jawbreaker\". After the release of this album the band split up and the members started in other bands such as Driller Killer (Cliff), and Wolfpack (Jonsson).\n\nIn 2005 Dead City records released the \"A Tribute To Anti-Cimex\" LP, featuring a line-up of D-beat and Crust bands from all over the world that were influenced by Anti-Cimex.

It is native to Europe, but is found on all temperate continents. It is a highly invasive species in some zones, resulting from its abundant seed dispersal, adaptability to reproduce, aggressive roots, ability to tolerate extreme climates, and hardiness.\n\nThe name, \"Rumex obtusifolius\", was assigned by Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century, and has remained unchanged, although there are numerous subspecies. \"Rumex\" was Pliny's name for sorrel, while \"obtusifolius\" means 'obtuse-leaved' (obtuse + foliage).\n\"Rumex obtusifolius\" is a perennial herbaceous flowering plant that grows to a height of . It is easily recognizable by its very large oval leaves with cordate bases and rounded tips, some of the lower leaves having red stems. The edges of the leaves are slightly \"crisped\" or wavy, the upper surface is hairless and the under surface may be papillose. The leaves of this plant can grow to about in length and wide. The taproot is large, with numerous branches extending to a depth of , with tough stems, often reddish, and unbranched until just below the inflorescence. \n\nThe junctions of the petioles with the stems are covered by a sheath formed by two fused stipules known as an ocrea, a thin, paper-like membrane - a characteristic of the family Polygonaceae. The stem leaves are alternate and are narrowly ovate–lanceolate. The inflorescence consists of large clusters of racemes which contain small greenish flowers that change to red as they mature. The perianth-segments are in two whorls of three. Segments in the outer whorl are small and spreading while the inner whorl forms fruit valves, which are widely ovately-triangular. The seeds produced are dry and reddish brown. This plant blooms June through September.\n\n\"Rumex crispus\" - curly dock - is similar in appearance, but with thinner and wave-like leaves. In more detail, the calyx of curly dock has smooth margins while the calyx of broad-leaved dock has horned margins.\n\n\"Rumex obtusifolius\" is widely distributed throughout the world. It is a plant growing readily on arable land, meadows, waste ground, roadsides, ditches, shorelines and riverbanks, woodland margins, forest clearings, and orchards. Seedlings can be identified by the oval leaves with red stems and rolled leaves sprouting from the center of the plant. Regrowth from the rosette usually takes place in spring.\n\nLeaves of the plant can be used as salad, to prepare a vegetable broth or to be cooked like spinach. They contain oxalic acid which can be hazardous if consumed in large quantities. Dried seeds are used as a spice. In Romania, the leaves are sometimes used as an alternative to other plants in the making of sarmale. A tea prepared from the root was thought to cure boils. In the United Kingdom, the plant is often found growing near stinging nettles and the underside of the dock leaf, squeezed to extract a little juice, can be rubbed on the skin to counteract the itching caused by brushing against a nettle plant.\n\nIn George Eliot's \"Adam Bede\", set in the early 19th century, broad dock leaves were used to wrap farmhouse butter.\n\n\"Rumex obtusifolius\" is a major host plant for many different insects as well, including the \"Acronicta rumicis\" moth. For \"A. rumicis\" research, this host plant is generally targeted because it is found highly within the moth's range.\n\n\"Rumex obtusifolius\" is an aggressive invasive species on all temperate continents. Broad-leaved dock is designated an \"injurious weed\" under the UK Weeds Act 1959. It has been an invasive species of the Great Lakes region of North America where it was first sighted in 1840. \n\nVarious parasites and predators of \"R. obtusifolius\" include 32 insect species and 12 fungi species. In the UK, the invertebrate herbivore species is a leaf beetle, \"Gastrophysa viridula\".\n"}

Student courts are a less-common feature of student governments.\n\nThe methods of selection for student courts also vary: at some institutions, the elected student body president nominates and appoints student court members with the consent of the elected student representative assembly; at others, a search committee interviews potential members who are subsequently nominated and officially appointed; at still other institutions, the sitting members of the student court actually participate in the process of nominating and selecting new court members.\n\nArguments in favour of having student courts often hinge on the idea of separation of powers, on the basis that the legislative bodies of student governments should not have the power to police themselves. Other arguments in favour include having the judicial system removed from partisan politics, having a neutral body to make decisions on issues such as election appeals, and greater transparency.\n\nArguments against having student courts often hinge on practicality, with critics saying that students are not necessarily qualified to make judicial decisions, or that university ombudspersons are better placed to fulfill the same role. Other arguments include a lack of accountability from student courts as well the additional bureaucracy that is created and the cost that it entails. Some critics also argue that placing power in the hands of unelected officials is undemocratic.\n\nThe judicial body of the Alma Mater Society of the University of British Columbia is the Student Court. The Student Court is granted the power to \"exercise disciplinary powers over the Society’s organizations and members.\"\n\nIt is composed of 5 judges and two alternate judges, all appointed by the AMS Council, with the Chief Justice also being named by the AMS Council. The Chief Justice must be a law student. The decisions of the Court only become binding once the AMS Council ratifies them.\n\nThe Student Court was created in the 1970s, but had been inactive from 2009 to 2015, until the AMS Council filling the positions again.\n\nThe judicial body of the Carleton University Students' Association is the Constitutional Board. The CUSA constitution gives the Constitutional Board the authority to \"rule that any act of Students' Council, its members, its officers, or its agents is in contravention of the Constitution, any Bylaw or Policy of the Association.\"\n\nThe Constitutional Board is composed of 5 members appointed by the Students' Council, of which 4 must be students and the fifth is the university's ombudsperson, who acts as chair. There are also two alternate members. Constitutional Board members serve one year terms, and cannot be members of the Students' Council. Meetings of the Board are held publicly, and decisions of the Board cannot be appealed.\n\nThe constitution of the Student Federation of the University of Ottawa does not formally recognise a judicial body for the Federation, but, the powers of the Constitutional Committee closely resemble those of a student court. The Committee has the power to make binding decisions, but those decisions can be overturned by the Board of Administration through a simple majority vote.\n\nThe Constitutional Committee is composed of 5 members of the Board of Administration, as well as two alternate members (also members of the Board of Administration) in the case of a conflict of interest. The members of the Constitutional Committee chose a member from among themselves to act as chair. Meetings of the Committee are held in-camera.\n\nThe SFUO used to have a judicial system (originally known as the Student Court, and then the Student Arbitration Committee) independent from its BoA, but that body was abolished in 2011, and its powers transferred to the newly created Constitutional Committee.\n\nThe judicial body of the University of Alberta Students' Union is the Discipline, Interpretation, and Enforcement Board (also known as the DIE Board). The DIE Board is governed by the union's Bylaw 1500, which defines the Board as \"the organ of the Students’ Union responsible for the interpretation and enforcement of Students’ Union legislation,\" and gives the Board scope to rule on complaints made regarding possible constitutional violations, interpretation of union legislation and rulings made by the elections office.\n\nThe DIE Board is composed of one Chief Tribune, two Associate Chief Tribunes and 5 to 11 additional tribunes. The tribunes are appointed through recommendation of the Tribune Selection Committee and ratification by a 2/3rds vote of the Students' Council. Tribunes cannot be members of the Council, members of Council committees or be an employee of the Union, and hold office until they graduate, resign or are impeached by a 2/3rds vote of the Students' Council.\n\nThe University of Calgary Students' Union has two judicial bodies: the Review Board, acting as the lower student court, and the Tribunal, acting as the higher student court.\n\nThe Review Board consists of 9 people, appointed by the Student Legislative Committee from a list provided by the Nominations Committee. Of the 9 members of the Review Board, at least 5 must be students and at least 2 must be non-students. The chair of the Review Board must be one of the students. The Tribunal consists of 5 people, appointed by the SLC from a list provided by the Nominations Committee. Of the 5 members of the Tribunal, at least one must be a student and at least one must be a non-student. The chair of the Tribunal must be one of the non-students.\n\nMembers of the Review Board and Tribunal serve two-year terms, unless during their terms they fail to meet one of a list of qualifications, including having been a member of SLC, the University of Calgary Board of Governors, Senate, or General Faculties Council, being an executive for a student club, being an employee of the Union and taking part in any student election (other than just voting).\n\nThe judicial body of the University of Manitoba Students' Union is the Judicial Board. The decisions of the Judicial Board cannot be overturned by any other UMSU body.\n\nThe Judicial Board is composed of one UMSU member acting as Chair, three Councillors, and five additional UMSU members. The members of the Judicial Board are appointed by the Selections Committee, and cannot be employees of the Union or executives.\n\nThe judicial body of the Hong Kong University Students' Union is the Judicial Committee (JC), It follows the Union Council Judicial Procedure and serves as the Union’s ultimate judiciary.

According to their website, it is formed by two courts: The Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal is the final court of appeal within the Union, whereas the Court of First Instance primarily deals with cases at first instance.\n\nThe Court of First Instance hears:\n\n（a） disciplinary charges contrary to Union statutes laid against a Union Member;\n\n（b） charges laid against a public officer of the Union following an impeachment; and\n\n（c） application for judicial review.\n\nThe Court of Appeal hears appeals from the Court of First Instance, as well as points of law relating to the Constitution referred to by the President of the Union or the Chairperson of the Representative Council.\n\nThe judicial body of the HKUST Students' Union is The Court. According to The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Students' Union Constitution, The Court shall be the judiciary body of the Union and shall have the following power and duties:\n\n（a） to settle disputes within the Students' Union; and\n\n（b） to call for further information and may require any member or suborganization of the Students' Union to give any relevant evidence in respect of its arbitration; and\n\n（c） to impose penalties on sub-organizations or members of the Students' Union in accordance with the provisions of the Students' Union Constitution; and\n\n（d） to quash any resolution of a General Meeting, that is in conflict with the Students' Union Constitution or a resolution passed by a Referendum; and\n\n（e） to quash any legislative resolution of the Council, that is in conflict with the Students' Union Constitution, a resolution passed by a Referendum or a General Meeting, or an existing valid legislative resolution passed by the Union Council; and\n\n（f） to quash any administrative resolution of the Council, the Executive Committee and the Editorial Board that is illegal, irrational, or procedurally improper; and\n\n（g） to interpret the Students' Union Constitution.\n\nThe judicial body of the City University of Hong Kong Students’ Union (CityUSU) is the Arbitration Committee ( ). According to their website, It has jurisdiction in respect of matters conferred on it by the Students' Union Constitution and Arbitration Committee by-law.\n\nThe Arbitration Committee is authorised :\n\n（a） to hand all disputes and complaints within the Students’ Union; and\n\n（b） to interpret the Constitution and the by-laws of the Students' Union, all resolutions of the Union Council, and all regulations formulated by the Executive Committee; and\n\n（c） to declare that the resolutions of the Union Council or the regulations formulated by the Executive Committee are void on the basis of being unconstitutional; and\n\n（d） to handle complaints concerning a General Polling or the outcome of the elections of student societies; and\n\n（e） to consider possible disciplinary actions against any full member.\n\nThe judicial body of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Students’ Union is the Union Judicial Council ( ).

The Commission was convened to carry out a comprehensive redrafting of the Union's Constitution, and after \"look[ing] into the governance structure of other Student Unions, including foreign ones\", it was \"[i]n particular…impressed with the Adjudication Committee in the City University of Hong Kong Students' Union\". Citing the Singapore Court of Appeal's \"dictum\" in \"Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs\" that \"all power has legal limits\", it envisaged the Adjudication Committee as \"an organ within the Union governance structure to enforce such legal limits and resolve disputes between Constituent Clubs or members\".\n\nThe Adjudication Committee's functions were to adjudicate disputes within the Union, interpret the Union's Constitution and hear appeals arising from disciplinary actions.\n\nDuring its three-year existence, the Adjudication Committee made two reported decisions. In \"Re Yale-NUS College Students\" [2014] NUSSU AC 2, it decided by a 5-2 majority that, as a matter of constitutional interpretation, Yale-NUS College students were not Union members. One dissenting panel member wrote that \"YNC students should be integrated into the Union so as to prevent segregation of the student populace\".\n\nThe Adjudication Committee was abolished in January 2016 \"because its roles and responsibilities are redundant\". In October 2018, NUSSU invited applications to join the Adjudication Committee.\n\nSince January 2016, the judicial power of the Union has been vested in the Council, together with the Union's legislative power and executive authority.\n\nThe Union Election Committee has the power to adjudicate all disputes raised by candidates in the Executive Committee Elections or by constituent clubs' election committees.\n"}

In contrast, circadian rhythms complete one cycle daily, while infradian rhythms such as the human menstrual cycle have periods longer than a day. The \"Oxford English Dictionary's\" definition of \"Ultradian\" specifies that it refers to cycles with a period shorter than a day but longer than an hour.\n\nThe descriptive term ultradian is used in sleep research in reference to the 90–120 minute cycling of the sleep stages during human sleep.\n\nThere is a circasemidian rhythm in body temperature and cognitive function which is technically ultradian. However, this appears to be the first harmonic of the circadian rhythm of each and not an endogenous rhythm with its own rhythm generator.\n\nOther ultradian rhythms include blood circulation, blinking, pulse, hormonal secretions such as growth hormone, heart rate, thermoregulation, micturition, bowel activity, nostril dilation, appetite, and arousal. Ultradian rhythms of appetite require antiphasic release of Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), stimulating and inhibiting appetite ultradian rhythms. Recently, ultradian rhythms of arousal lasting approximately 4 hours were attributed to the dopaminergic system in mammals. When the dopaminergic system is perturbed either by use of drugs or by genetic disruption, these 4 hours rhythms can lengthen significantly into the infradian (>24hr) range, sometimes even lasting for days (>110hr) when methamphetamines are provided.\n\nUltradian mood states in bipolar disorder cycle much faster than rapid cycling; the latter is defined as four or more mood episodes in one year, sometimes occurring within a few weeks. Ultradian mood cycling is characterized by cycles shorter than 24 hours.\n\n"}

Bubbles\n\nJohn William Sublett (February 19, 1902 – May 18, 1986), known by his stage name John W. Bubbles, was an American vaudeville performer. He performed in the duo \"Buck and Bubbles.\" He is also known as the father of \"rhythm tap.\"\n\nJohn William Subblett was born in Louisville, Kentucky on February 19, 1902, but soon moved with his family to Indianapolis. There, he formed a partnership with Ford L. \"Buck\" Washington in 1919. Their duo was known as \"Buck and Bubbles.\" Buck played stride piano and sang, and Bubbles tapped along. They were so popular that the duo moved to Manhattan, New York City in September of that year. They played together in the Columbia Theater, the Palace and played with artists Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor and Danny Kaye. They were on the \"Ziegfeld Follies of 1931.\" They also became the first black artists to perform at the Radio City Music Hall. \"Buck and Bubbles\" performed live in the first scheduled 'high definition' television program on November 2, 1936 at Alexandra Palace, London, for the BBC, becoming the first black artists on television anywhere in the world.\n\nThough unable to read music, Bubbles was chosen by George Gershwin to create the role of Sportin' Life in his opera \"Porgy and Bess\" in 1935. Since he didn't understand the music score, Gershwin spent the time to teach it to him as a tap rhythm. Sublett caused some problems because he often made up rhythms which caused confusion with other members of the cast. Sublett performed the role occasionally for the next two decades. In 1963, in a studio recording of \"Porgy and Bess\" featuring Leontyne Price and William Warfield, he performed Sportin' Life's two main arias from the opera, \"It Ain't Necessarily So\" and \"There's A Boat Dat's Leavin' Soon For New York\".\n\nIn 1920 he gave lessons in tap dancing to Fred Astaire, who considered Sublett the finest tap dancer of his generation. In the number \"Bojangles of Harlem\" from \"Swing Time\" (1936) Astaire dresses in blackface as the Sportin' Life character and dances in the style of Sublett while ostensibly paying tribute to Bill Robinson.\n\nSublett appeared in Hollywood films of the late 1930s and 1940s, including \"Varsity Show\" in 1937, \"Cabin in the Sky\" in 1943 and \"A Song Is Born\" in 1948. In later life, he also made television appearances, one of his last being on a musical episode of \"The Lucy Show\", which also guest-starred Mel Tormé and a featured performance on Barbra Streisand's 1967 TV special, \"The Belle of 14th Street\", a tribute to the bygone era of vaudeville.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, John Bubbles toured the war zone with the USO. In 1965, he appeared with Eddie Fisher on a USO tour, visiting many outposts and camps in the early war years. He appeared with Judy Garland in her 1967 concert at the Palace Theatre, singing \"Me And My Shadow.\" That same year, he became partially paralyzed due to a stroke.\n\nIn 1978, John Bubbles spoke at the Variety Arts Theatre in Los Angeles as a participant in a seminar on vaudeville. Someone asked him who the best tap dancer was. Bubbles answered, \"You're looking at him.\" Then he added, \"Honestly, if I had to name the best dancer, it would be Fred Astaire. He could tap. He had a good teacher. But he could ballroom, dance with a partner. All in all, he's the best.\" That same night, Bubbles mentioned that Astaire had brought him into the rehearsal hall to work on \"Bojangles of Harlem\" and John's chops are right there in the number.\n\nHe performed at the Newport Jazz Festival in New York in 1979, which was one of his last public appearances. Sublett died on May 18, 1986, at his home in Baldwin Hills, California.\n\nSublett is known as the father of \"rhythm tap,\" a form of tap dance. Sublett included percussive heel drops in his tap style, as opposed to the tap dancing of Bill Robinson (Bojangles) who emphasized clean phrases and toe taps. Sublett's taps were made to the traditional eight-bar phrase, but allowed for more rhythmic freedom. He blended the improvisational style of jazz music with the traditional techniques of tap to create a unique style and sound.\n\nSublett received the 1980 Life Achievement Award from the American Guild of Variety Artists. He was inducted into the Tap Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nSublett was remembered by many celebrities; his catchphrase, \"Shoot the liquor to me, John Boy,\" has been quoted in songs by several artists, including The Manhattan Transfer, The Ink Spots, and Louis Armstrong. Michael Jackson admired Bubbles' dancing and studied his steps for inspiration. In the mid-1980s Jackson named his beloved pet chimpanzee \"Bubbles\" in memory of John Sublett.\n\n"}

A satirical look at Cambridge life and the struggle between tradition and reform, \"Porterhouse Blue\" tells the story of Skullion, the Head Porter of Porterhouse, a fictional college of Cambridge University.\n\nThe novel has a sequel, \"Grantchester Grind\". In 1987, Channel 4 adapted \"Porterhouse Blue\" into a TV series of the same name.\n\nThe central characters are Skullion, the Head Porter; Zipser, a research graduate student; Sir Godber Evans, the Master; Lady Mary, the Master's wife; the Dean; and Mrs. Biggs, Zipser's bedder.\n\nFor the first time in five hundred years, the master of Porterhouse fails to name his successor on his deathbed before dying. He succumbs to a \"Porterhouse Blue\" - a stroke brought about by overindulgence in the college's legendary cuisine. Sir Godber Evans is appointed as his successor. Sir Godber, egged on by his zealous wife, Lady Mary, announces sweeping changes to the centuries of college tradition, much to the concern of Skullion and the Fellows, who plan a counter-attack on the proposed contraceptive machines, women students, and canteen.\n\nMeanwhile, the only research graduate student in the college, Zipser, visits the hard-of-hearing Chaplain and explains his fixation for Mrs Biggs, his middle-aged, large-breasted bedder, through a megaphone, and is therefore overheard by the whole college. Mrs Biggs is not within earshot, but nevertheless senses that something is up from Zipser's awkward behaviour around her every time she comes to clean his room and especially when she teases him sexually, the climax of which is when she asks him to help her take off her bright red PVC raincoat from behind, in the tight confines of the \"gyp\".\n\nWhile Sir Godber congratulates himself on having defeated the traditionalists, investigative journalist Cornelius Carrington is brought in on the pretext of helping both parties, while secretly having his own agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, having been advised to pick up a foreign student, so as to avoid his lust for Mrs Biggs, Zipser after a series of frustrating attempts to buy condoms, accidentally acquires two large boxes. Concerned that he has technically stolen them, he tries many ways to get rid of them and eventually inflates them with gas from the gas fire in his room and floats them up the chimney, not realising that some get stuck in the chimney and the rest float down into the college court. Fearing for the good name of college, Skullion spends the night bursting the inflated condoms.\n\nMrs Biggs has decided to reciprocate Zipser's passion, and sneaks up to Zipser's room in the middle of the night and wakes him up. To his amazement she undresses and, despite his protests, promptly enters his bed and lies on top of him. Unfortunately, while undressing, she has lit the gas fire, which takes a short while to ignite the inflated condoms stuck in the chimney, causing an explosion that demolishes the Bull Tower and kills her and Zipser in their moment of passion.\n\nSkullion refuses to open the main gates of college to let the fire engines in and continues to burst the inflated condoms; partly as a consequence he is fired. Skullion visits the bank and discovers his nest egg of shares inherited from a previous master is worth a fortune. He takes his revenge by giving a shocking revelatory interview on Carrington's live television show. Skullion pleads with Sir Godber to be reinstated, but is refused. Skullion hits Sir Godber, causing him to fall and sustain a mortal injury. Skullion quickly leaves. Two senior academics find the dying Sir Godber who whispers them one word: Skullion. They agree that, in accordance with college tradition, Skullion has been named the new Master of Porterhouse.\n\nWhen Skullion is visited by the college officials with the good news, he thinks they have found out his involvement with Sir Godber's death and whilst they are telling him about his great fortune, he has a debilitating \"Porterhouse Blue\" himself, becoming totally paralysed. Nonetheless, he is installed as the Master and his shares are sold for rebuilding the Bull Tower, so Porterhouse's traditions are firmly re-established.\n\nThere have also been two audio book versions;\n\n"}

A double album containing 45 songs, \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" combines elements of punk rock, funk, country, spoken word and jazz, and references a variety of themes, from the Vietnam War and racism in America, to working-class experience and linguistics.\n\nAfter recording new material, each band member selected songs for different sides of the double album, with the fourth side named \"Chaff\". Several songs on \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" were outsourced to or inspired by contemporaries, such as Black Flag's Henry Rollins and Jack Brewer of Saccharine Trust.\n\n\"Double Nickels on the Dime\" is seen not only as Minutemen's crowning achievement, but, according to critic Mark Deming, \"one of the very best American rock albums of the 1980s\". The album now appears on many professional lists of the all-time best rock albums, including \"Rolling Stone\"'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Slant Magazine listed the album at on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980s\". Despite this, the full version of the album is only available on vinyl.\n\nMinutemen were formed by guitarist D. Boon and bassist Mike Watt, both from San Pedro, California, in 1980. After their previous band, The Reactionaries, disbanded in 1979, the pair continued to write new material and formed the band with drummer Frank Tonche a year later. Minutemen signed to the Californian independent record label SST Records following their second gig. George Hurley, the former drummer of The Reactionaries, replaced Tonche as drummer soon afterwards. The Minutemen were noted in the California punk scene for a philosophy of \"jamming econo\"; a sense of thriftiness reflected in their touring and presentation. They soon released numerous recordings through SST and their own label, New Alliance Records, while touring with hardcore punk bands like Black Flag and Hüsker Dü.\n\nIn January 1983, Minutemen were asked by ex-Blue Cheer keyboardist and local producer Ethan James to contribute a song to \"Radio Tokyo Tapes\", a compilation named after the Californian studio where James worked. The band agreed and contributed three songs to the compilation, with James recording them all for free. These three songs, and another five recorded in May 1983 for a total of $50, were included in their 1983 EP \"Buzz or Howl Under the Influence of Heat\". The band had recorded solely with SST engineer Spot prior to the recordings. However, they were so impressed by the sessions that they enlisted James to record their next full-length album; Watt later commented: \"Ethan, although not knowing us much, tapped right in.\" After their European tour in mid-1983 with Black Flag, Minutemen entered Radio Tokyo Studios in November to record their next studio album.\n\nMinutemen originally recorded an \"album's worth of material\" with James in November 1983 in Radio Tokyo Studios. However, after hearing labelmates Hüsker Dü's double album \"Zen Arcade\" (1984), which had been recorded a month earlier, Minutemen decided to write more material. Watt later commented: \"It wasn't really a competition even. When I wrote 'Take that Hüskers!\" in [the album's liner notes] it was acknowledging that they gave us the idea to make a double album.\" Unlike Hüsker Dü's \"Zen Arcade\", Minutemen did not have a unifying concept, but soon decided that the record's concept would be their cars.\n\nThe band wrote almost two dozen more songs for a second recording session with James in April 1984. \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" was then mixed on a single eight-track in one night by James and cost $1,100 to record. Several songs on the album were recorded elsewhere; a studio-recorded cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Don't Look Now\" was replaced with a live version of the song, and according to Watt, \"Love Dance\" was written at Ian MacKaye's Dischord House.\n\nFor sequencing, the band decided that each band member would be allocated a side of the record, an arrangement inspired by Pink Floyd's 1969 double album \"Ummagumma\". The band drew straws to select songs; Hurley won the draw and decided to pick his solo track \"You Need the Glory\", followed by Boon and Watt. The fourth side of the record was named \"Side Chaff\", an admission that the songs present were the leftover songs.\n\nWatt refers to the album as being the band's art record in the documentary \"We Jam Econo: The Story of The Minutemen\". The songwriting styles of Boon and Watt on \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" contrasted. Boon tended to write the band's anthems, and often explored wider political issues. \"This Ain't No Picnic\" was an example of his approach. Exploring racism and the strife of the working class with both gravity and humor, he composed the song after his supervisor would not let him listen to jazz and soul music on the radio at his day job, calling it \"nigger shit\".\n\nWatt favored complex and abstract lyrical themes, exemplified by songs such as \"The Glory Of Man\" and \"My Heart and the Real World\". Influenced by James Joyce's novel \"Ulysses\" (the subject of \"June 16th\") and the stream of consciousness literary technique in general, Watt's lyrics were often complex and philosophical. On \"Take 5, D.\", Boon felt that the lyrics were \"too spacey\". Watt agreed to rewrite the song, adding: \"There ain't nothing going to be more real.\" He found a new set of lyrics: a note from a friend's landlady about a leaking shower.\n\n\"Double Nickels on the Dime\" contained several inside jokes that were missed by the band's audience. Watt later remarked: \"No one knew what the fuck we were talking about. We'd explain it to people and they'd say, 'I don't get it, what's so funny about that?' And we couldn't tell them because it was our whole angle on the rock & roll, our worldview on the music scene.\"\n\nThe album was named \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" as a reaction to the Sammy Hagar song \"I Can't Drive 55,\" a protest against the federally imposed speed limit of 55 miles per hour on all U.S. highways in place at the time. Minutemen decided that driving fast \"wasn't terribly defiant\"; Watt later commented that \"the big rebellion thing was writing your own fuckin' songs and trying to come up with your own story, your own picture, your own book, whatever. So he can't drive 55, because that was the national speed limit? Okay, \"we'll\" drive 55, but we'll make crazy music.\"\n\nThe band illustrated the theme on the cover of \"Double Nickels on the Dime\", which depicts Watt driving his Volkswagen Beetle at exactly 55 miles per hour (\"double nickels\" in trucker slang) traveling southbound through downtown Los Angeles, where Interstate 10 (\"The Dime\" in trucker slang) meets the San Pedro Intersection of Route 11/110, also known as the Harbor Freeway, toward the band's hometown of San Pedro, California. \"The title means fifty-five miles per hour on the button, like we were Johnny Conservative.\" Dirk Vandenberg, the band's \"buddy/contributor,\" took photos from the backseat as Watt drove under the sign to San Pedro; it took three circuits of the highway and two days of photography before Minutemen were happy with the cover. Vandenberg later commented on the cover art: \"There were three elements that Mike [Watt] wanted in the photo: a natural kind of glint in his eyes reflected in the rearview mirror, the speedometer pinned exactly at 55mph, and, of course, the San Pedro sign guiding us home\". However, when the cover was presented to SST, \"someone botched the cropping for the print and cut off the end of the word Pedro.\"\n\nIn 2020, Watt revealed that the front cover of the album was also inspired by the cover of Kraftwerk's 1974 album \"Autobahn\".\n\nSST Records released \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" on double vinyl in July 1984. SST delayed the release of \"Zen Arcade\" by Hüsker Dü so that both albums could be released simultaneously. After the release of \"Double Nickels on the Dime\", Minutemen toured almost constantly to promote the record. One 1984 tour saw the band playing 57 dates in 63 days. The album sold fifteen thousand copies during 1984, a respectable amount for a band on an independent record label. As of 2008, \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" remains Minutemen's best-selling record.\n\nNo singles were released to promote \"Double Nickels on the Dime\", but SST did press a sampler EP that was sent to radio stations. Titled, \"Wheels of Fortune,\" the sampler put nine of the album's \"deep cuts\" onto one side of a 12\" record and featured an etching by Raymond Pettibon on the other. The band also released two videos, \"This Ain't No Picnic\" and \"Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love\" (a cover of a song by Van Halen, which the aforementioned Hagar would eventually join), as \"flyers\". Made for $440 by a University of California, Los Angeles graduate, Anthony Johnson, \"This Ain't No Picnic\" was Minutemen's first video and was later nominated for an MTV award. The video for \"This Ain't No Picnic\" features the band playing amidst rubble as a fighter plane \"piloted\" by Ronald Reagan, edited from public domain footage, fires at them. The video of \"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\", released by SST as a promotional video, was a 40-second recording of a live performance.\n\nIn August 1987, Watt and producer Vitus Matare remastered \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" for a CD release. To ensure that the CD would be compatible with all players, they omitted all car jams except Boon's, and three songs: \"Mr. Robot's Holy Orders\", \"Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love\" and \"Little Man With A Gun In His Hand\". Watt commented later that the remix was a \"nightmare\" and \"totally worse than the Ethan James mix.\" Watt reverted to the original mix for a 1989 CD release of \"Double Nickels on the Dime\", but did not include the previously omitted songs. In a January 2006 interview, Watt announced his intention to discuss a remastered full \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" CD release with SST owner Greg Ginn.\n\nUpon its release, \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" received critical acclaim from a range of American critics; however as a regional independent record label, many of SST's releases did not attract attention from British music magazines. Robert Palmer of \"The New York Times\" called the album \"more varied musically than any of their earlier disks\", adding that the band \"think of themselves as town criers, addressing their young constituencies directly with lyrics that apply to the life styles they share, teaching such values as tolerance of cultural, racial and sexual differences\". \"The Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau described Boon as a \"somewhat limited singer\" but \"a hell of a reader, with a guitar that rhymes\", and remarking \"this is poetry-with-jazz as it always should have been\". Christgau later said that he underrated the album on its original release. \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" placed at number 14 in the publication's end of year Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Reviewing the album in February 1985 for \"Rolling Stone\", David Fricke awarded the album three and a half stars, and also praised Boon's technique, stating: \"The telegraphic stutter and almost scientific angularity of singer-guitarist D. Boon's chordings and breakneck solos heighten the jazzier tangents he dares to take,\" but that \"\"Double Nickels on the Dime\"'s best moments go far too quickly.\"\n\nLater reviews have also been positive: AllMusic's Mark Deming described \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" as a \"quantum leap into greatness\" for Minutemen, describing the album as \"full of striking moments that cohere into a truly remarkable whole\" and awarding a full five stars. Journalist Michael Azerrad, profiling Minutemen in his book \"Our Band Could Be Your Life\" (titled after a lyric from \"History Lesson – Part II\"), named \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" as \"one of the greatest achievements of the indie era\" and described it as a \"Whitman's sampler of left-wing politics, moving autobiographical vignettes, and twisted Beefheartian twang\". Several publications have raised their rating of the album in the years since its release; \"Rolling Stone\" re-reviewed \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" for the 2004 \"Album Guide\" and gave it its classic rating, a full five stars.\n\nAlthough not commercially successful upon its release, \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" marked the point where many punk bands began to ignore the stylistic limitations of the hardcore scene. According to \"\" author Steven Blush, \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" was, along with \"Zen Arcade\", \"either the pinnacle or downfall of the pure hardcore scene.\" Watt later commented that \"Double Nickels on the Dime\" was the \"best album I ever played on.\"\n\nThe album was included in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". AcclaimedMusic.net finds it to be the 258th most acclaimed album of all time. In 2019, the listeners of KEXP-FM ranked it the 223rd greatest album of all time (out of 666).\n\nThe album inspired a collection of comics and drawings entitled \"Double Nickels Forever\". The book features work by 58 artists based on 45 songs from the album. The album was also featured as an entry in Continuum International Publishing Group's 33 1/3 series of books. Michael T. Fournier authored the book which breaks the album down song by song to analyze its creation.\n\nAll released CD versions omit songs to ensure player compatibility. The tracks removed include\n\"Mr. Robot's Holy Orders\", \"Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love\", \"Little Man with a Gun in His Hand\", \"Don't Look Now\" and \"Dr. Wu\". The 1989 CD release restored the last two songs in place of three of the \"car jams\".\n\nAll online and streaming versions reflect the 1989 CD track listing, with missing songs.\n\nOne-sided record sent to radio stations to promote \"Double Nickels on the Dime\"\n\nAll information taken from the 1989 CD release of \"Double Nickels on the Dime\":\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2131234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2131234", "title": "Soninke people", "text": "Soninke people\n\nThe Soninke (also called Sarakole, Seraculeh, or Serahuli) are a West African ethnic group found in eastern Senegal and its capital Dakar, northwestern Mali and Foute Djalon in Guinea, The Gambia and southern Mauritania. They speak the Soninke language, also called \"Maraka\" language, which is one of the Mande languages.\nSoninke people were the founders of the ancient empire of Ghana c. 750–1240 CE. Subgroups of Soninke include the Maraka and Wangara. When the Ghana empire was destroyed, the resulting diaspora brought Soninkes to Mali, Senegal, Mauritania, Gambia, Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Guinea-Bissau where some of this trading diaspora was called Wangara.\n\nPredominantly Muslims, the Soninke were one of the early ethnic groups from sub-Saharan West Africa to convert to Islam in about the 10th century. The contemporary population of Soninke people is estimated to be over 2 million. The cultural practices of Soninke people are similar to the Mandé peoples, and those of the Imraguen of Mauritania. It includes traditional Islamic rites of marriage(s), circumcision, and has social stratification.\n\nArchaeological evidence suggests that the regions where Soninke people are found were inhabited in ancient times. These stone settlements were built on the rocky promontories of Tichit-Walata and the Tagant cliffs of Southern Mauritania. Though there are no surviving records to suggest which ethnic group these people were, the settlers of this region by between 2500 BCE and 600 BCE were likely related to the Soninke people. A significant agro-pastoral society had developed in this prehistoric era.\n\nAccording to Soninke oral tradition, the ancestor of the Soninke was Dinga, sometimes said to have come from the Middle East, an addition that may reflect Abrahamic religious influence. His sons included Dyabe Sisse, the founder of the Wagadu kingdom with its capital at Kumbi. Another Soninke tradition indicates that they migrated from Aswan, Egypt. However theories of foreign origin are generally doubted by scholars and are believed to result from later cultural influences. Archaeological evidence supports an evolution of the Ghana Empire and other Soninke states from roots in preceding local ancestral Soninke cultures such as that of Dhar Tichitt, rather than from North Africa or the Middle East.\n\nThe early written records about Soninke come from early Islamic historians. The Soninke, according to these records, were the founders of the ancient Ghana Empire (not to be confused with modern Ghana), also called the Wagadu Empire. This empire has roots in the 5th century CE and was destroyed by about the 12th century, after the Muslim invasions of this region started in the 10th century.\n\nIn contemporary time, the total population of Soninke people is above 2 million. Soninke people are found throughout West Africa and in France, given their migration when Senegal and Mali were a part of the French colonial empire.\n\nMost of the Soninke people are found in the valley of the upper Senegal river and along the Mali–Senegal–Mauritania border between Nara and Nioro du Sahel. Migrations under French colonial rule led many Soninke to build communities in Dakar, other cities in Africa and in France. Soninke community were the early settlers in France, their community is found in Paris and in southern French cities, and their language is the primary dialect spoken among many Muslim communities of France. There are also many Soninke living in cities throughout Central Africa, a population that includes new migrants as well as descendants of migration dating back to the 1800s, such as the laptots who represented French mercantile and colonial interests in the region.\n\nTrade networks led by the \"Wangara\" mercantile confederations, spread Soninke people and culture throughout most of Mali and Senegal, southern Mauritania, northern Burkina Faso, as well as parts of the Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau. The Maraka-Soninke merchant communities and plantations (centered just north of the city of Segou, Mali) were an economic mainspring under the Bambara Empire, and built trade routes in the West Africa region.\n\nThe Soninke people were a coastal trade link between the Berber people of Maghreb and the Empires in sub-Saharan West Africa. In their early history, they helped exchange salt from the north and western coast for gold found inland. This trade brought Muslim traders to them, particularly Arab traders interested in gold, after Islam arrived in North Africa. The earliest passing mention of Soninke people's Ghana Empire is found in the works of the 8th century Arab geographer Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm al-Fazārī and a more complete record is found in works of another 11th century Arab geographer Al-Bakri.\n\nThe rulers and Soninke people of the Ghana Empire converted to Islam in the 11th century, and they have been Muslim ever since. Some Islamic sources suggest that the conversion was triggered after the 1076 Almoravid conquest of the Ghana Empire. The Soninke people, like other Mande peoples, subscribe to the Maliki school of Sunni Islam.\n\nThe Soninke society and its culture has historically many cultural practices with its neighboring ethnic groups, particularly the Mande peoples. This includes the religion of Islam, occupations, foods, the rites of passage, family structure, weddings and social stratification.\n\nSoninke society, like other groups in Mande and beyond, is shaped by various forms of social stratification.\n\nThe Soninke strata have included a free category called \"Horro\" or \"Horon\", a caste system category called \"Namaxala\" or \"Nyaxamalo\", and slaves called \"Komo\". In the Jaara subgroup of the Soninke people, the nobility called \"Tunkanlenmu\" was another strata. Soninke society became highly stratified after the 13th century.\n\nThe slaves were the largest strata, one at the bottom among the Soninke like other West African ethnic groups, and constituted up to half of the population. The slaves among the Soninke people were hierarchically arranged into three strata. The village slaves were a privileged servile group who lived apart from the village and took orders from the village chief. The domestic slaves lived with a family and could not be sold. The lowest level among slaves were the trade slaves who could be bought and sold. With time, each of these strata became endogamous, states Daniel Littlefield, a professor of history.\n\nAbove the slaves were the castes of Soninke, which too were hereditary, endogamous, and had an embedded hierarchical status. They included, for example, the \"garanke\" (leather workers) below the \"fune\" (bard), the \"fune\" below the \"gesere\" or \"jeli\" (griots, singers), and the \"jeli\" below the \"tage\" or \"numu\" (smiths, pottery workers).\n\nThe castes and slaves system of Soninke may be linked. According to Susan McIntosh, a professor of anthropology specializing in African societies, archaeological evidence shows that Arabs and Berbers had expanded and established an integrated sub-Saharan trade and transport network with West Africa, building upon the pre-existing trade routes through western Sudan. This trade, by the 9-10th centuries, states McIntosh, included commodities and slaves. The reach of slave trading had extended into Ghana and the western Atlantic coast by the 11th century, and slave raiding, capture, holding and trading systems became increasingly sophisticated in 13th and 14th century Mali Empire and 16th century Songhai Empire.\n\nAs the practice of slavery grew, so did the caste system. Tamari suggests that a corollary of the rising slavery system was the development and growth of the caste system among numerous ethnic groups of Africa by about the 13th century. McIntosh concurs with Tamari, but states that the emergence of caste systems likely occurred much earlier in West African societies such as Soninke, Mande, Malinke, Wolof, Serer, and others. She places the development and spread of castes in these societies to about the 10th century, because the slave capture, slave trade and slave holding by elite families was an established institution in West Africa by then, and slavery created a template for servile relationships and social stratification of human beings.\n\nThe linguistic evidence suggests that stratification structure relating to caste system and slavery likely were shared between the Manding and Soninke people, and possibly some others such as the Dogon people of West Africa. However, the linguistic differences between the caste and slave systems between Soninke and northern ethnic groups of Africa such as the Tuareg people and Moors suggests that these evolved separately.\n\nMarriage in Soninke society follows Islamic practices. Cousin marriages are common and preferred in Soninke culture, just as with the Fula people. Parents consent to marriage. A traditional proverb states, \"Cousins are made for each other.\" The practice among Soninke merchants, states Saskia Brand, a professor of psychology and educational sciences, may be related to the cultural belief that cousin marriages \"helps to keep the money in the family\".\n\nIf both families agree, the couple is engaged (\"i na tamma laga\") in a mosque. Each month after the engagement, the man pays the woman's family a bridewealth dower (\"nakhafa\") for their food and other spending. The marriage, called \"futtu\", is complete with a marriage contract that mentions the dower, and is accompanied with a wedding event called \"karikompe\".\n\nThe newly married couple has advisors. The man's advisor is called the “khoussoumanta-yougo” and the woman's is called “khoussoumanta-yakhare”. After one week of celebration, the women meet to show the gifts that the couple received from their parents mostly from the woman's mother.\n\nMarriage across social strata and caste lines has been taboo, states Saskia Brand. But, in polygynous noble families, a noble could take a wife from the slave strata.\n\nThe Soninke practise circumcision and call it \"birou\". Every afternoon, the boys who were circumcised the previous year organize \"tam-tams\" for the new boys in order to prepare them psychologically. Throughout the circumcision ceremony, the boys to be circumcised sit around the “tambour” called “daïné”. The other teenagers of the village, young girls, women, men, and slaves form a circle around the boys. During this time the boys are surrounded with beautiful scarves called \"disa\" sing. The author Mamadou Soumare wrote “Above its traditional surgery, the ritual of circumcision makes in evidence, the physical endurance, the pain, the courage, in one word the personality of the child.”\n\nThe Soninke people have long carried out female genital mutilation (FGM), also called female circumcision. The prevalence rate of FGM is higher among the Soninke than among neighbouring ethnic groups such as Wolof people and others. The practice is culturally done as a ritual of social acceptance, and sometimes assumed to be required for religious reasons. In Mauritania and Senegal, FGM of a child is illegal in contemporary law but continues because it is culturally sanctioned for young girls as young as one year old. According to the 2009 Report on Human Rights Practices by the US State Department, FGM practice among Soninke has included the most dangerous Type III mutilations.\n\nBreakfast foods include \"fonde\", porridge made of millet, sugar, milk, and salt, and \"sombi\" porridge made of rice, millet or corn. For lunch \"demba tere\" and \"takhaya\" are very common, both containing rice and peanuts, frequent Soninke ingredients. \"Dere\", a stew, is a mixture of millet and beans.\n\nThe Soninke traditionally engage in both trade and agriculture. During the rainy season, men and women both cultivate. However, women usually stay at home to cook and take care of their children. They also do other work, such as dyeing cotton material.\n\nMany early West African immigrants in France came from this ethnic group. The Soninke are an influential ethnic group in the Gambia, Senegal and Mali.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2131237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2131237", "title": "Autobianchi Primula", "text": "Autobianchi Primula\n\nThe Autobianchi Primula is a supermini economy car manufactured between 1964 and 1970 by the Italian automaker Autobianchi, partly owned by and later a subsidiary of the Fiat Group. The Primula was a prototype for Fiat's rack and pinion steering and is widely known for its innovative Dante Giacosa-designed front-wheel drive, transverse engine layout — that would be later popularized by the Fiat 128 to ultimately become an industry-standard front drive layout.\n\nThe Primula was originally available with two or four doors, with or without a rear hatchback, referred to in Italian as \"\"berlina\"\". Beginning in 1965, Autobianchi offered a coupé model, a more spacious 2-door fastback designed by Carrozzeria Touring.\n\nThe Primula was manufactured in the Autobianchi factory in Desio, with production reaching approximately 75,000 before ending in 1970.\n\nPrior to the Primula, all Fiat Group passenger cars were rear-wheel drive; the larger models followed the classic FR layout (front engine powering the rear axle), and small cars were rear-engined. Meanwhile, a practical concept emerged, namely the front-wheel drive layout with the engine mounted transversely, which allowed for very efficient space utilization. This arrangement had been popularised by the British Motor Corporation's Mini, launched in 1959. That car had its transmission integrated into the engine's oil sump, producing a very compact drivetrain for use on a small car. However the Mini had significant transmission problems early in its production run and the arrangement had poor refinement, high noise levels and was awkward to service. The early issues were resolved and the concept spread to larger BMC products, notably the 1100/1300 series built in Italy by Innocenti. These larger models did not require the transmission-in-sump arrangement for the purposes of space utilization (as on the Mini) but retained it for design and parts commonality. \n\nFiat's chief designer, Dante Giacosa, recognized the potential of the concept and sought ways to improve on it - namely by removing the transmission from the sump. This would produce a larger overall powertrain unit but this was not essential in the type of cars Giacosa proposed. In return such cars would be easier to service and repair and benefit from greater refinement and lower noise levels. Fiat was cautiously accepting of Giacosa's proposal and decided to experiment without risking damage to the image of its popular Fiat-branded cars. Thus the Autobianchi Primula emerged—a car marketed under a less crucial nameplate, for which it was an entry into a whole new class of vehicles. The key to Giacosa's design was a compact concentric clutch release mechanism using a hydraulic piston mounted inside a hollow gearbox input shaft, thus doing away with the traditional external clutch lever and release arm and the internal clutch thrust bearing. This allowed the powertrain to be short enough to fit across the Primula's engine bay while allowing for the required steering angles and the determined overall width. With the transmission mounted end-on to the engine and the final drive therefore offset from the car's centre line, the Primula had unequal-length driveshafts. \n\nInitially, the Primula was fitted with the 1221 cc engine from the Fiat 1100 \"D\" (for the coupé it was uprated to ), but in 1968 it was replaced with Fiat 124 engines—the berlinas received the 1197 cc engine from the standard versions, while the coupé was fitted with the more powerful 1438 cc unit. All engines used in the Primula had overhead valves (OHV)—the later twin cam derivative of the 1438 cc unit was not used in any Autobianchi (Fiat did use it later in the Lancia Beta- the issue at the time in a transverse installation of a twin-cam head being the arrangement of the exhaust manifold of the necessarily cross-flow head). Unlike contemporaneous BMC and Peugeot models, which had the transmission in the oil sump, the Primula had its manual transmission placed end-on, above the differential. The Primula also featured disc brakes on all four wheels, uncommon in small cars of the time.\n\nThe Primula's particular configuration of front wheel drive and transverse engine, but with a gearbox on the end of the engine, ingenious Fiat-designed clutch release mechanism and unequal length drive shafts, rather than a gearbox in the sump like the Mini, has become universal among front-wheel-drive cars. Suspension was a single wishbone and upper transverse leaf spring in the front and a \"dead\" rear axle. The Primula is thus a car design of far greater significance than is often realised, as its design influence spread, far beyond even the mainstream high volume Fiats such as the 128 and the 127 of the late 1960s which used its driveline layout combined with MacPherson struts; to every front wheel drive transverse engined car in production today.\n\nThe Primula was favorably received in the marketplace and came second in the 1965 European Car of the Year awards, after another front-wheel drive car, the Austin 1800. This convinced Fiat to develop the drive concept further. In 1969 the first Fiat with a front-mounted transverse engine, the Fiat 128, was launched, along with two new front-wheel drive Autobianchis: the Autobianchi A112, smaller than the Primula, and the larger Autobianchi A111. The 128 secured Fiat the Car of the Year title in 1970, with A112 coming second.\n\n"}

After studying law at Leipzig he established himself as advocate at Weissenfels and made his debut as an author with the novel \"Incest, oder der Schutzgeist von Avignon\".
