In standard inflationary cosmological models, the redshift of cosmological bodies is ascribed to the expansion of the universe, with greater redshift indicating greater cosmic distance from the Earth (see Hubble's Law). This is referred to as cosmological redshift. Ruling out errors in measurement or analysis, quantized redshift of cosmological objects would either indicate that they are physically arranged in a quantized pattern around the Earth, or that there is an unknown mechanism for redshift unrelated to cosmic expansion, referred to as \"intrinsic redshift\" or \"non-cosmological redshift\".\n\nIn 1973, astronomer William G. Tifft was the first to report evidence of this pattern. Subsequent discourse focused upon whether redshift surveys of quasars (QSOs) have produced evidence of quantization in excess of what is expected due to selection effect or galactic clustering. The idea has been on the fringes of astronomy since the mid-1990s and is now discounted by the vast majority of astronomers, but a few scientists who espouse nonstandard cosmological models, including those who reject the Big Bang theory, have referred to evidence of redshift quantization as reason to reject conventional accounts of the origin and evolution of the universe.\n\nWilliam G. Tifft was the first to investigate possible redshift quantization, referring to it as \"redshift-magnitude banding correlation\". In 1973, he wrote:\n\nTifft, now Professor Emeritus at the University of Arizona, suggested that this observation conflicted with standard cosmological scenarios. He states in summary:\n\nStudies performed in the 1980s and early 1990s produced confirmatory results:\n\n\nMost recent discourse has focused upon whether redshift surveys of quasars (QSOs) produce evidence of quantization beyond that explainable by selection effect. This has been assisted by advances in cataloging in the late 1990s that have increased substantially the sample sizes involved in astronomical measurements.\n\nHistorically, K. G. Karlsson and G. R. Burbidge were first to note that quasar redshifts were quantized in accordance with the empirical formula:\n\nWhere:\n\nThis predicts periodic redshift peaks at formula_2 = 0.061, 0.30, 0.60, 0.96, 1.41, and 1.9, observed originally in a sample of 600 quasars, verified in later early studies.\n\nA 2001 study by Burbidge and Napier found the pattern of periodicity predicted by Karlsson's formula to be present at a high confidence level in three new samples of quasars, concluding that their findings are inexplicable by spectroscopic or similar selection effects.\n\nIn 2002, Hawkins \"et al.\" found no evidence for redshift quantization in a sample of 1647 galaxy-quasar pairs from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey:\n\nIn response, Napier and Burbidge (2003) argue that the methods employed by Hawkins \"et al.\" to remove noise from their samples amount to \"excessive data smoothing\" which could hide a true periodicity. They publish an alternate methodology for this that preserves the periodicity observed in earlier studies.\n\nIn 2005, Tang and Zhang found no evidence for redshift quantization of quasars in samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF redshift survey.\n\nArp \"et al.\" (2005) examined sample areas in the 2dF and SDSS surveys in detail, noting that quasar redshifts:\n\nA 2006 study of 46,400 quasars in the SDSS by Bell and McDiarmid discovered 6 peaks in the redshift distribution consistent with the decreasing intrinsic redshift (DIR) model. They conclude that this correlation is unlikely to be a selection effect, given the method used to determine intrinsic redshift relations.\n\nSchneider \"et al.\" (2007) and Richards \"et al.\" (2006) report that the periodicity reported by Bell and McDiarmid disappears after correcting for selection effects. However, Bell and Comeau (2010) have since argued that this correction removes nearly half of the sample and does not explain how selection effects give rise to redshift peaks. The same study also concludes that a \"filter gap footprint\" renders it impossible to verify or falsify the presence of a true redshift peak at Δ\"z\" = 0.60.\n\nA 2006 review by Bajan \"et al.\" discovered weak effects of redshift periodization in data from the Local Group of galaxies and the Hercules Supercluster. They conclude that \"galaxy redshift periodization is an effect which can really exist\", but that the evidence is not well established pending study of larger databases.\n\nA 2007 absorption spectroscopic analysis of quasars by Ryabinkov \"et al.\" observed a pattern of statistically significant alternating peaks and dips in the redshift range Δ\"z\" = 0.0 − 3.7, though they noted no statistical correlation between their findings and Karlsson's formula.\n"}

{"id": "1909895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1909895", "title": "Nixtamalization", "text": "Nixtamalization\n\nNixtamalization () is a process for the preparation of maize (corn), or other grain, in which the corn is soaked and cooked in an alkaline solution, usually limewater (but sometimes wood ash lye), washed, and then hulled. This process is known to remove up to 97–100% of aflatoxins from mycotoxin-contaminated corn. The term can also refer to the removal via an alkali process of the pericarp from other grains such as sorghum.\n\nNixtamalized maize has several benefits over unprocessed grain: it is more easily ground; its nutritional value is increased; flavor and aroma are improved; and mycotoxins are reduced. Lime and ash are highly alkaline: the alkalinity helps the dissolution of hemicellulose, the major glue-like component of the maize cell walls, and loosens the hulls from the kernels and softens the maize. Some of the corn oil is broken down into emulsifying agents (monoglycerides and diglycerides), while bonding of the maize proteins to each other is also facilitated. The divalent calcium in lime acts as a cross-linking agent for protein and polysaccharide acidic side chains. As a result, while cornmeal made from untreated ground maize is unable by itself to form a dough on addition of water, the chemical changes in masa allow dough formation. These benefits make nixtamalization a crucial preliminary step for further processing of maize into food products, and the process is employed using both traditional and industrial methods, in the production of tortillas and tortilla chips (but not corn chips), tamales, hominy, and many other items.\n\nIn the Aztec language Nahuatl, the word for the product of this procedure is or ( or ), which in turn has yielded Mexican Spanish (). The Nahuatl word is a compound of \"ashes\" and \"unformed corn dough, tamal\". The term \"nixtamalization\" can also be used to describe the removal of the pericarp from any grain by an alkali process, including maize, sorghum, and others. When the unaltered Spanish spelling is used in written English, however, it almost exclusively refers to maize.\n\nThe labels on packages of commercially sold tortillas prepared with nixtamalized maize usually list \"corn treated with lime\" as an ingredient in English, while the Spanish versions list .\n\nThe ancient process of nixtamalization was first developed in Mesoamerica, where maize was originally cultivated. There is no precise date when the technology was developed, but the earliest evidence of nixtamalization is found in Guatemala's southern coast, with equipment dating from 1200–1500 BCE.\n\nHow nixtamalization was discovered is not known, but one possibility may have been through the use of hot stones (see Pot boiler) to boil maize in early cultures which did not have cooking vessels robust enough to put directly on fire or coals. In limestone regions like those in Guatemala and southern Mexico, heated chunks of limestone would naturally be used, and experiments show that hot limestone makes the cooking water sufficiently alkaline to cause nixtamalization. Archaeological evidence supporting this possibility has been found in southern Utah, United States.\n\nThe Aztec and Mayan civilizations developed nixtamalization using slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and ash (potassium hydroxide) to create alkaline solutions. The Chibcha people to the north of the ancient Inca also used calcium hydroxide (also known as \"cal\"), while the tribes of North America used naturally occurring sodium carbonate or ash.\n\nThe nixtamalization process was very important in the early Mesoamerican diet, as unprocessed maize is deficient in free niacin. A population that depends on untreated maize as a staple food risks malnourishment and is more likely to develop deficiency diseases such as pellagra, niacin deficiency, or kwashiorkor, the absence of certain amino acids that maize is deficient in. Maize cooked with lime or other alkali provided niacin to Mesoamericans. Beans provided the otherwise missing amino acids required to balance maize for complete protein.\n\nThe spread of maize cultivation in the Americas was accompanied by the adoption of the nixtamalization process. Traditional and contemporary regional cuisines (including Maya cuisine, Aztec cuisine, and Mexican cuisine) included, and still include, foods based on nixtamalized maize.\n\nThe process has not substantially declined in usage in the Mesoamerican region, though there has been a decline in North America. Many North American Native American tribes, such as the Huron, no longer use the process. In some Mesoamerican and North American regions, dishes are still made from nixtamalized maize prepared by traditional techniques. The Hopi obtain the necessary alkali from ashes of various native plants and trees. Some contemporary Maya use the ashes of burnt mussel shells, while other Maya cook maize with small pieces of limestone.\n\nIn the United States, European settlers did not always adopt the nixtamalization process, except in the case of hominy grits, though maize became a staple among the poor of the southern states. This led to endemic pellagra in poor populations throughout the southern US in the early 20th century. A more varied diet and fortification of wheat flour, the other staple food, have essentially eliminated this deficiency.\n\nMaize was introduced to Europe by Christopher Columbus in the 15th century, being grown in Spain as early as 1498. Due to its high yields, it quickly spread through Europe, and later to Africa and India. Portuguese colonists grew maize in the Congo as early as 1560, and maize became, and remains, a major food crop in parts of Africa.\n\nAdoption of the nixtamalization process did not accompany the grain to Europe and beyond, perhaps because the Europeans already had more efficient milling processes for hulling grain mechanically. Without alkaline processing, maize is a much less beneficial foodstuff, and malnutrition struck many areas where it became a dominant food crop. In the nineteenth century, pellagra epidemics were recorded in France, Italy, and Egypt, and kwashiorkor hit parts of Africa where maize had become a dietary staple.\n\nHealth problems associated with maize-based diets in modern times have usually been remedied by means of vitamin supplements and economic improvement leading to a broader diet, rather than by adoption of nixtamalization. Though pellagra has vanished from Europe and the United States, it remains a major public health problem in lower Egypt, parts of South Africa, and southwestern India.\n\nIn the first step of nixtamalization, kernels of dried maize are cooked in an alkaline solution at or near the mixture's boiling point. After cooking, the maize is steeped in the cooking liquid for a period. The length of time for which the maize is boiled and soaked varies according to local traditions and the type of food being prepared, with cooking times ranging from a few minutes to an hour, and soaking times from a few minutes to about a day.\n\nDuring cooking and soaking, a number of chemical changes take place in the grains of maize. Because plant cell wall components, including hemicellulose and pectin, are highly soluble in alkaline solutions, the kernels soften and their pericarps (hulls) loosen. The grain hydrates and absorbs calcium or potassium (depending on the alkali used) from the cooking solution. Starches swell and gelatinize, and some starches disperse into the liquid. Certain chemicals from the germ are released that allow the cooked grains to be ground more easily, yet make dough made from the grains less likely to tear and break down. Cooking changes the grain's protein matrix, which makes proteins and nutrients from the endosperm of the kernel more available to the human body.\n\nAfter cooking, the alkaline liquid (known as nejayote), containing dissolved hull, starch, and other corn matter, is decanted and discarded (or sometimes used for making amate bark paper). The kernels are washed thoroughly of remaining nejayote, which has an unpleasant flavor. The pericarp is then removed, leaving the endosperm of the grain with or without the germ, depending on the process. This hulling is performed by hand, in traditional or very small-scale preparation, or mechanically, in larger scale or industrial production.\n\nThe prepared grain is called nixtamal. Nixtamal has many uses, contemporary and historic. Whole nixtamal may be used fresh or dried for later use. Whole nixtamal is used in the preparation of pozole, menudo, and other foods. Ground fresh nixtamal is made into dough and used to make tortillas, tamales, and arepas. Dried and ground, it is called masa harina or instant masa flour, and is reconstituted and used like masa.\n\nThe term hominy may refer to whole, coarsely ground, or finely ground nixtamal, or to a cooked porridge (also called samp) prepared from any of these.\n\nAn alternative process for use in industrial settings has been developed known as enzymatic nixtamalization which uses protease enzymes to accelerate the changes that occur in traditional nixtamalization. In this process, corn or corn meal is first partially hydrated in hot water, so that enzymes can penetrate the grain, then soaked briefly (for approximately 30 minutes) at 50°–60 °C in an alkaline solution containing protease enzymes. A secondary enzymatic digestion may follow to further dissolve the pericarp. The resulting nixtamal is ground with little or no washing or hulling.\n\nBy pre-soaking the maize, minimizing the alkali used to adjust the pH of the alkaline solution, reducing the cooking temperature, accelerating processing, and reusing excess processing liquids, enzymatic nixtamalization can reduce the use of energy and water, lower nejayote waste production, decrease maize lost in processing, and shorten the production time (to approximately four hours) compared to traditional nixtamalization.\n\nEffects of enzymatic nixtamalization on flavor, aroma, nutritional value, and cost, compared to traditional methods, are not well documented.\n\nThe primary nutritional benefits of nixtamalization arise from the alkaline processing involved. These conditions convert corn's hemicellulose-bound niacin (\"niacytin\") to free niacin, making it available for absorption into the body, thus helping to prevent pellagra. Alkalinity also reduces the amount of the protein zein available to the body, which improves the balance among essential amino acids, although the overall amount of protein is reduced.\n\nSecondary benefits can arise from the grain's absorption of minerals from the alkali used or from the vessels used in preparation. These effects can increase calcium (by 750%, with 85% available for absorption), iron, copper, and zinc.\n\nLastly, nixtamalization significantly reduces (by 90–94%) mycotoxins produced by \"Fusarium verticillioides\" and \"Fusarium proliferatum\", molds that commonly infect maize, the toxins of which are putative carcinogens.\n\n"}

A sharp point at the end of the explorer is used to enhance tactile sensation.\n\nIn the past it was usual for dentists to use the explorer to probe teeth for the presence of cavities. Some dental professionals have questioned this practice in the first decade of the twenty-first century. The use of a sharp explorer to diagnose caries in pit and fissure sites is no longer recommended and clinicians instead should rely on \"sharp eyes and a blunt explorer or probe.\" Penetration by a sharp explorer can actually cause cavitation in areas that are remineralizing or could be remineralized. Dental lesions initially develop as a subsurface lesion. Early lesions may be reversed - with meticulous patient self-care and application of fluoride - as long as the thin surface layer remains intact. The use of a dental explorer with firm pressure to probe suspicious areas may result in the rupture of the surface layer covering early lesions. Instead, they argue that fluoride and oral hygiene should be used to remineralize the enamel and prevent it from decaying further. This debate still continues because sometimes decay can be difficult to diagnose without tactile verification. Additionally, radiographs and other products designed to identify decay (such as measuring fluorescence from a laser) help the dental professional make a final diagnosis of tooth decay.\n\nThere are various types of explorers, though the most common one is the No. 23 explorer, which is also known as a \"shepherd's hook\". Other types include the 3CH (also known as \"cowhorn\" or \"pigtail\") and No. 17 explorers, which are useful for the interproximal areas between teeth.\n\n"}
{"id": "1909939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1909939", "title": "Hot tub", "text": "Hot tub\n\nA hot tub is a large tub or small pool full of water used for hydrotherapy, relaxation or pleasure. Some have powerful jets for massage purposes. Hot tubs are sometimes also known as spas or by the trade name Jacuzzi.\n\nIn contrast to a typical bathtub, a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. Hot tubs are usually located outdoors, although they can be installed indoors. Also, the water in a hot tub is not changed with each use, but is kept sanitary using methods similar to those used for swimming pool sanitation. Another difference between baths and hot tubs is that soaps and shampoos are not used in wet-jetted hot tubs (although they can be used in air-jetted hot tubs).\n\nThe earliest hot tubs were calderas in which hot stones were placed to heat the water. Therma in Ikaria has been a very popular place particularly for hydrotherapy ever since the 4th century BC. The remains of wrecked marble bathtubs along with a pre-historic aqueduct that have been unearthed from this area bear ample testimony of the place's popularity in the ancient times.\n\nIn 737 A.D., Japan's first onsen opened near Izumo, Shimane, and centuries later the first ryokan (inns) were built, offering food, accommodations, and soaking tubs called ofuro.\n\nIn ancient Rome there were three types of baths: baths at home (balnea), private baths (balnea privata), and public baths (balnea publica). The practice of bathing was so engrained that the Roman legions, during their long occupations in foreign lands, built their own baths at mineral and thermal springs in the newly conquered lands. Examples are found all over Europe.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 and the rise of Christianity, cleanliness was abandoned since the Church considered that the practice of bathing a prelude to forbidden behaviour. At Cluny custom required monks to take a full bath at Christmas and Easter. Private bath-rooms in castles, such as the one at Leeds, could often accommodate multiple bathers. From the 13th century onwards, baths gradually came into re-use, particularly in southern Europe under the influence of the Moors.\n\nIn the 1940s hot tubs began to appear in the US, inspired by the Japanese ofuro. Hydrotherapy pumps were introduced by Jacuzzi. Fiberglass shell hot tubs appeared around 1970 and were soon superseded by cast acrylic shells.\n\nThe plumbing of the hot tub consists of:\n\nHot tubs are usually heated using an electric or natural gas heater, though there are also submersible wood fire hot tub heaters, as well as solar hot water systems. Hot tubs are also found at natural hot springs; in this case, the water may be dangerously hot and must be combined with cool water for a safe soaking temperature.\n\nEffective insulation greatly improves the energy efficiency of a hot tub. There are several different styles of hot tub insulation: some manufacturers fill the entire cabinet with foam, while others insulate the underside of the shell, the inside of the cabinet, or both. Many manufacturers advertise the superiority of their approach to insulation, but few independent side-by-side comparisons are available. The hot tub pump and hot tub heater represent most of the power consumption in a hot tub and vary in use of power depending on their size.\n\nEnergy efficiency of the tubs has been studied by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PGEC). The industry has responded to the study. After this study, both the California Energy Commission and National Resources Canada have taken an interest in the energy efficiency of portable hot tubs (late 2006). California's portable electric hot tub listing include R values of thermal insulation, and standby watts.\n\nIn 2019 an update to the ANSI standard for energy efficiency was approved. For the first time, this new standard increases the minimum energy efficiency level for portable spas and inflatable spas.\nHot tub covers have been shown to reduce most of the evaporative losses from the pool when not in use. With this component of heat loss being 70% a cover with even a small R-value is able to achieve as much as a 75% reduction in heating costs when used as opposed to leaving the water surface exposed.\n\nThere are several different types of spa covers. Some covers are better for insulation and therefore are lighter on internal parts and energy efficiency. Some examples of covers are insulated, aluminum, rolling, or a tonneau.\n\nSince some hot tubs are not drained after each use it is necessary to treat the water to keep it attractive and safe. It must be neither too alkaline nor too acidic, and must be sanitised to stay free of harmful microorganisms. Partly due to their high water temperatures, hot tubs can pose particular health risks if not regularly maintained: outbreaks of Legionnaires' Disease have been traced to poorly sanitized hot tubs. Typically chlorine or bromine are used as sanitizers, but salt water chlorination is starting to become more common. Hot tubs should also be periodically shocked, which means oxidizing or breaking down organic material left behind from the sanitizer, as well as non-filterable material such as soap films and perspiration.\n\nSanitation can also be aided by a non-chemical ozonator.\n\nFor aesthetic reasons, and for the sanitizer to work properly, water should be neither too alkaline nor too acidic (low pH). The hardness level of the water, measured as the amount of dissolved calcium, is also important. Insufficient hardness can lead to corrosion and water foaming.\n\nSitting in water above normal body temperatures can cause drowsiness which may lead to unconsciousness and subsequently result in drowning. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recommends that water temperatures never exceed 40 degrees Celsius. A temperature of 37 degrees is considered safe for a healthy adult. Soaking in water above 39 degrees Celsius can cause fetal damage during the first three months of pregnancy.\n\nIt is also recommended to install residual-current devices for protection against electrocution. The greater danger associated with electrical shock in the water is that the person may be rendered immobile and unable to rescue themselves or to call for help and then drown.\n\nHot tubs and spas are equipped with drains that can create powerful suction and between 1980 and 1996, the CPSC had reports of more than 700 deaths in spas and hot tubs, about one-third of which were drownings to children under age five. In the same period 18 incidents were reported to the CPSC involving body part entrapment. To reduce the risk of entrapment, US safety standards require that each spa have two drains for each pump, reducing the amount of suction. From 1999 to 2007 there were 26 reports to the CPSC concerning circulation entrapments hot tubs and spas, including three deaths.\n\nIn 2001 and in 2012 the CPSC issued recalls for spa heaters which overheated and caused fires.\n\nThe Uniform Swimming Pool, Spa and Hot Tub Code is a model code developed by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO) to govern the installation and inspection of plumbing systems associated with swimming pools, spas and hot tubs as a means of promoting the public's health, safety and welfare.\n\nPoorly sanitized hot-tubs have been linked to a number of diseases, principally caused by facultative anaerobic bacteria. Such incidents include hot tub folliculitis and legionellosis.\n"}

It is located north-east of the inner city of Sarajevo and was established in May 1952 with the organization of people's committees. Those local people's committees founded the local municipalities, which led to self-management of the municipalities, including the municipality of Ilijaš.\n\nIn the early Middle Ages close to the river Bosna and Vogoščica the district Vogošća or Vidogošća was formed. Some later events that are tied to the Ottoman period came to the formation of džemats, nahiyahs and sanjaks. In the beginning of the nineteenth century there were 20 džemats in the Sarajevo Nahiyah: Butmir, Kijevo, Presjenica, Sudići, Trnovo, Zijamet Crna Rijeka, Pale, Mokro with Bobogovićima, Kriva Rijeka, Srednje, Čifluk Crna Rijeka, Rakova Noga, Vogošća, Nahorevo, Kulijes, Rakovica, Hadžići, Drozgometva, Pazarić and the villages of Luka i Žeravica.\n\nThe occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Austro-Hungarian Empire led to many changes which manifested to administrative and political changes. The territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina was divided into districts and further divided into counties. The counties were divided into municipalities, instead of dzemats, and they were furthermore divided into mahallahs and hamlets while the functions of the muhtars and village chiefs remained the same. The modern municipality of Ilijaš at that time was divided into the Sarajevo and Visoko counties and the boundary line between these two counties was the Povučje stream and the hill Bukovac which was between the stream and Ljubina.\nThe administrative division of Bosnia and Herzegovina until the formation of bans in 1929 remained the same even during the Austro-Hungarian occupation. Only after 1922 oblasts were formed instead of districts. Everything remained the same until 1941. Right after the freeing of the temporary national assembly of the Federal Bosnia and Herzegovina the assembly's first session in August 1945 brought up the law of the territorial division of Bosnia and Herzegovina in districts, counties and areas of local people's committees and their headquarters.\n\nThe municipality of Ilijaš is composed of two parts, the town of Ilijaš and the upper municipality. The town of Ilijaš is composed by several localities. The biggest and most urban is the center and it has about 10,000 residents, the second is the settlement of Misoča (\"Naselje Misoča\"), with 1500 residents. Ethnically, there is a majority of Bosniaks with about 1300 people, 250 are Serbs, 50 are Croats, with none classified as others.

In 2001, the city's population was 292,000, which declined to 256,714 by 2013. Economic activity is predominantly coal mining and the chemical industry. The Horlivka State Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages has a two building campus in the city centre.\n\nThe city was severely damaged during the War in Donbass and has since been mainly under control of pro-Russian forces. Suburbs of Horlivka stayed under Ukrainian army control.\n\nIn 1779 the city was founded as Gosudarev Posad (meaning posad of Gosudar of Russia) and in 1869 it was renamed after Pyotr Gorlov as Gorlovka (locally Horlivka). The workers' town provided basic services to and organization of a series of mining camps.\n\nDuring the Russian Revolution of 1905, it was the scene of an armed uprising.\n\nIn April 1918 troops loyal to the Ukrainian People's Republic took control of Horlivka.\n\nSubsequently, under Soviet control, by the 1930s it had expanded considerably and become a major center for mining operations in the Ukrainian SSR.\n\nThe city was occupied by German troops from 1941–1943. During World War II retreating Nazis burned buildings and perpetrated mass shootings. Nonetheless, the city's population had risen to over 400,000 by the end of the war.\n\nIn recent years many mines have closed. The population fell by more than ten percent during the 1990s.\n\nIn the middle of April, 2014, and shortly thereafter, pro-Russian separatists captured several towns in Donetsk Oblast. A group of separatists seized the police station in Horlivka on April 14; the city hall was seized on April 30. The mayor of the city, Yevhen Klep, was detained by the separatists on June 11, and not released until July 18. Local chief of police Andriy Kryschenko was captured and badly beaten by the insurgents. A Horlivka city council deputy, Volodymyr Rybak, was kidnapped by the pro-Russian militants on 17 April. His body was later found in a river on 22 April. The city administration building was seized on 30 April, solidifying separatist control over Horlivka. Self-proclaimed mayor of Horlivka Volodymyr Kolosniuk was arrested by the SBU on suspicion of participation in \"terrorist activities\" on 2 July.\n\nOn July 21 and 22, 2014, the city saw heavy fighting. The Ukrainian army reportedly retook parts of Horlivka on July 21. After the Ukrainian army had retaken Lysychansk on July 25, 2014, the recapture of Horlivka became a priority, for the city was seen as \"a direct path to the regional center - Donetsk\". As of 28 July, the city was reported to be fully surrounded by Ukrainian troops, with rebels holding their positions inside. However, Horlivka continued to be controlled by separatist forces. As of June 2015 it was situated 10 kilometers from the war front. Suburbs of Horlivka stayed under Ukrainian army control. In November 2017 they regained control of the villages of Travneve and Hladosove north of Horlivka.\n\nAs reported by the city administration, from the beginning of the conflict till late January 2015 274 local civilians were wounded and 92 killed, including 9 children. Because of the conflict the city's population shrank to 180,000.\n\nIn late March 2019, according to Ukrainian media reports, Ukrainian army mine clearance specialist Andriy Shor, who participated in both battles for the Donetsk Airport and the Battle of Pisky, announced on Facebook that the Ukrainian army had recently taken control of Horlivka city. Unian reported that Ukrainian forces have secured the outskirts of the city and are slowly advancing further towards the center of Horlivka, citing Ukrainian volunteer Yuriy Mysiahin. In May the separatists tried to push the Ukrainian forces back, but failed.\n\nEthnic composition as of the Ukrainian Census of 2001:\nFirst language as of the Ukrainian Census of 2001:\n\nDespite the fall of communism a statue of Lenin still stands in a central square bearing his name. Horlivka is well served by CNG-buses (see Natural gas vehicle), but much of the city's Soviet-era infrastructure shows signs of deterioration. By contrast, a number of modern shops and a new cathedral (completed 2014) in the town center indicate some rejuvenation.\n\nOn the eastern side of Horlivka there is an abandoned chemical plant which used to produce toxic explosives and has been reported to be in a dangerous condition. Mining activity has resulted in large spoil tips being visible around the city, but a tree-planting project and ongoing forestry maintenance has revitalised an area to the north.\n\nThe city was severely damaged during the War in Donbass.\n\nThe city is divided into three city districts: Mykytivka, Kalinin, and City Center.\n\nThe city municipality also includes several towns and villages.

{"id": "1909954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1909954", "title": "Symphony No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)", "text": "Symphony No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)\n\nThe Symphony No. 2 in E minor, Op. 27, is a symphony by the Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff, written in 1906–07. The premiere was conducted by the composer himself in Saint Petersburg on 8 February 1908. Its duration is approximately 60 minutes when performed uncut; cut performances can be as short as 35 minutes. The score is dedicated to Sergei Taneyev, a Russian composer, teacher, theorist, author, and pupil of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Alongside his Prelude in C-sharp minor, Piano Concerto No. 2 and Piano Concerto No. 3, and Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, this symphony remains one of the composer's best known compositions.\n\nAt the time his Symphony No. 2 was composed, Rachmaninoff had had two successful seasons as the conductor of the Imperial Opera at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. He considered himself first and foremost a composer and felt that the performance schedule was detracting from his time to compose. \nHe then moved with his wife and infant daughter to Dresden, Germany, to spend more time composing and to also escape the political tumult that would put Russia on the path to revolution. The family remained in Dresden for three years, spending summers at Rachmaninoff's in-law's estate of Ivanovka. It was during this time that Rachmaninoff wrote not only his Second Symphony, but also the tone poem \"Isle of the Dead\".\n\nRachmaninoff was not altogether convinced that he was a gifted symphonist. At its 1897 premiere, his Symphony No. 1 (conducted by Alexander Glazunov) was considered an utter disaster; criticism of it was so harsh that it sent the young composer into a bout of depression. Even after the success of his Piano Concerto No. 2 (which won the Glinka Award and 500 rubles in 1904), Rachmaninoff still lacked confidence in his writing. He was very unhappy with the first draft of his Second Symphony but after months of revision he finished the work and conducted the premiere in 1908 to great applause. The work earned him another Glinka Award ten months later. The triumph restored Rachmaninoff's sense of self-worth as a symphonist.\n\nBecause of its formidable length, Symphony No. 2 has been the subject of many revisions, particularly in the 1940s and 1950s, which reduced the piece from nearly an hour to as little as 35 minutes. Before 1970 the piece was usually performed in one of its revised, shorter, versions. Since then orchestras have used the complete version almost exclusively, although sometimes with the omission of a repeat in the first movement. The 2016 Previn / LSO CD is one of the abridged versions still available (9026-60791-2).\n\nThe symphony is scored for full orchestra with 3 flutes (the 3rd doubling on piccolo), 3 oboes (the 3rd doubling on cor anglais), 2 clarinets in A and B, bass clarinet in A and B, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, glockenspiel, and strings.\nThe symphony is in four movements:\n\nThe first movement begins with a slow introduction, in which the 'motto' theme of the symphony is introduced and developed. This leads to an impassioned climax, after which a cor anglais solo leads the movement into the allegro in sonata form. Assuming the symphony is performed uncut, this also includes a full repeat of the exposition. In contrast to the exposition, the development is stormy at times and moves through multiple key centres. Only the first subject and central motto theme are used in the development. After a long dominant pedal, the music slowly transitions to the recapitulation in E major, in which only the second subject is recapitulated, but is heavily expanded on compared to the exposition. This device of omitting the first subject from the recapitulation was also used by Tchaikovsky in his second, fourth and sixth symphonies. The coda in E minor builds up intensely and the movement culminates in two \"fortissimo\" outbursts.\n\nThis movement really only \"resembles\" a scherzo insofar as it relates to the early- to mid-Romantic tradition of symphonic movements, and its use of a typical scherzo form (ABACABA). However, it is in 2/2, while the typical scherzo would be in 3/4 or some kind of triple meter. The movement, in A minor, opens with a lively ostinato in the upper strings. As a fixture in large-scale works by Rachmaninoff, the Dies Irae plainchant is referenced, here in the opening bars by the horns. The B section is a lyrical \"cantabile\" melody in C major. The music slows down and the opening ostinato is referenced, and in returning to the A section it abruptly speeds back up to its opening tempo. The central trio section notably begins with a sudden, \"tutti\", \"fortissimo\" B Dominant 7th chord, and is an example of Rachmaninoff's mastery of counterpoint and fugal writing, thanks to his studies with Taneyev, to whom this symphony is dedicated. At the conclusion of the movement, the Dies Irae is again stated, this time by a brass choir. The momentum dissolves, and the movement ends \"pianississimo\" (\"ppp\").\n\nThis movement is in a broad three-part form, and is often remembered for its opening theme, which is played by the first violins and restated both as a melody and as an accompanying figure later on in the movement. This opening theme, however, is really an introduction to the main melody of the movement, which is presented by a lengthy clarinet solo, and is a typical Rachmaninoff creation, circling around single notes and accompanied by rich harmony. The development is based on the Dies Irae motto theme of the symphony, as if it was continued on from the first movement's introduction. A chromatic buildup leads to an impassioned climax in C major. The intensity subsides, and the central melody of the third movement is restated, this time played by the first violins, while fragments of the opening theme are heard in the accompaniment. The Dies Irae motto is restated again apparently to bring about an ending to complement the first movement introduction, as the third movement concludes in a tranquil fashion dying away slowly in the strings. \nThe final movement is set in sonata form. The lively, fanfare-like first theme, derived from the first \"Dies Irae\"-like theme of the Scherzo, is played by the entire orchestra, leading into a march-like interlude starting in G# minor played by woodwind. After the return of the first theme, the first subject is concluded, and transitions directly into a massive, broad melody in D major played by strings. After dying down to \"pianissimo\", the opening theme of the third movement, this time in D major, is briefly recalled over string tremolos. After an abrupt interjection, the development section begins, which is in two sections, the first of which introduces new melodic ideas, and the latter of which revolves around a descending scale. The recapitulation initially only presents the first subject, before moving into a dominant pedal, building up to the triumphant restatement of the broad melody now in the home key of E major, in which fragments of the first theme, motto theme, and descending scale can be heard in the accompaniment. A whirlwind coda brings the symphony to a close, with a fortissimo restatement of the brass chorale that appeared at the end of the second movement. The final bars present another fixture of Rachmaninoff's large-scale works, the characteristic decisive four-note rhythm ending (in this case presented in a triplet rhythm), also heard in his Cello Sonata, second and third piano concertos, and in an altered form in his fourth piano concerto and Symphonic Dances.\n\nThe manuscript had been thought lost, until its discovery in the estate of a private collector in 2004. It was authenticated by Geoffrey Norris. It contains material that has not found its way into any published edition. The manuscript became the property of the Tabor Foundation, and was on permanent loan to the British Library.\nIn May 2014 the manuscript was auctioned by Sotheby's for £1,202,500.\n\nA section of the symphony's second movement is used several times in the 2014 film \"Birdman\", directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, and is even used in the trailers promoting it. It is featured as part of a score composed by Mexican jazz drummer Antonio Sánchez. \n\nOperatic tenor, Christian Ketter's arrangement of Rachminoff's Zdes Khorosho (Здесь хорошо/ How Fair This Place) Op. 21, No. 7 quotes the symphony's paralytic third movement in its introduction on the 2014 recording, \"Beloved: live in recital.\" \n\nParts of the third movement were used for pop singer Eric Carmen's 1976 song, \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\", which borrowed the introduction and main melody of the third movement as the song's chorus and bridge, respectively. As Rachmaninoff's music was still in copyright at the time (it has since expired in most countries), Carmen was made to pay royalties to the Rachmaninoff estate for the use of the composer's music, both for the aforementioned song and \"All By Myself\", which borrowed from his second piano concerto in its verse. The melody was also used by jazz pianist Danilo Pérez as the main theme of his tune \"If I Ever Forget You\" on his 2008 album \"Across the Crystal Sea\".\n\nIn April 2008 Brilliant Classics released Alexander Warenberg's arrangement of the symphony for piano and orchestra, titling it \"Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 5\". Warenberg arranged Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2 as a concertante work for piano and orchestra. The work contains about 40% of the source material from the symphony with some original scoring by Warenberg, modification of the original score and a change to many of the harmonies \"to improve the sound and balance\". Warenberg's arrangement is a three movement concerto with a new second movement and a revised finale \"to create a tighter and more effective emotional climax to the concerto’s finale.\"\n\nFor the concertante's first movement, the slow introduction developing the main motif is shortened from the symphony with the material not discarded but instead shifted to the concertante's cadenza immediately after the climax. The concertante's second movement largely following the symphony's third movement, except for immediately after the climax when the exposition of the symphony's second movement is inserted, before returning to the symphony's third movement recapitulation.\n\nNotable recordings include the following:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1909968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1909968", "title": "Cinema Novo", "text": "Cinema Novo\n\nCinema Novo () is a genre and movement of film noted for its emphasis on social equality and intellectualism that rose to prominence in Brazil during the 1960s and 1970s. It means \"New Cinema\" in Portuguese, which is the official language of Brazil, the movement's \"home\". Cinema Novo formed in response to class and racial unrest both in Brazil and the United States. Influenced by Italian neorealism and French New Wave, films produced under the ideology of Cinema Novo opposed traditional Brazilian cinema, which consisted primarily of musicals, comedies and Hollywood-style epics. Glauber Rocha is widely regarded as Cinema Novo's most influential filmmaker. Today, the movement is often divided into three sequential phases that differ in tone, style and content.\n\nIn the 1950s, Brazilian cinema was dominated by \"chanchada\" (musicals, often comedic and \"cheap\"), big-budget epics that imitated the style of Hollywood, and \"'serious' cinema\" that Cinema Novo filmmaker Carlos Diegues characterizes as \"sometimes cerebral and often ridiculously pretentious.\" This traditional cinema was supported by foreign producers, distributors and exhibitors. As the decade ended, young Brazilian filmmakers protested films they perceived as made in \"bad taste and ... sordid commercialism, ... a form of cultural prostitution\" that relied on the patronage of \"an illiterate and impoverished Brazil.\"\n\nCinema Novo became increasingly political. In the 1960s, Brazil was producing the most political cinema in South America. Brazil therefore became the natural “home of the Cinema Novo (New Cinema) movement”. Cinema Novo rose to prominence at the same time that progressive Brazilian Presidents Juscelino Kubitschek and later João Goulart took office and began to influence Brazilian popular culture. But it was not until 1959 or 1960 that 'Cinema Novo' emerged as a label for the movement. According to Randal Johnson and Robert Stam, Cinema Novo officially began in 1960, with the start of its first phase.\n\nIn 1961, the Popular Center of Culture, a subsidiary of the National Students' Union, released \"Cinco Vezes Favela\", a film serialized in five episodes that Johnson and Stam claim to be \"one of the first\" products of the Cinema Novo movement. The Popular Center of Culture (PCC) sought \"to establish a cultural and political link with the Brazilian masses by putting on plays in factories and working-class neighborhoods, producing films and records, and by participating in literacy programs.\" Johnson and Stam hold that \"many of the original members of Cinema Novo\" were also active members in the PCC who participated in the production of \"Cinco Vezes Favela\".\n\nBrazilian filmmakers modeled Cinema Novo after genres known for subversiveness: Italian neorealism and French New Wave. Johnson and Stam further claim that Cinema Novo has something in common \"with Soviet film of the twenties,\" which like Italian neorealism and French New Wave had \"a penchant for theorizing its own cinematic practice.\" Italian neorealist cinema often shot on location with nonprofessional actors and depicted working class citizens during the hard economic times following World War II. French New Wave drew heavily from Italian neorealism, as New Wave directors rejected classical cinema and embraced iconoclasm.\n\nSome proponents of Cinema Novo were \"scornful of the politics of the [French] New Wave\", viewing its tendency to stylistically copy Hollywood as elitist. But Cinema Novo filmmakers were largely attracted to French New Wave's use of auteur theory, which enabled directors to make low-budget films and develop personal fan bases.\n\nCinema Novo filmmaker Alex Viany describes the movement as having elements of participatory culture. According to Viany, while Cinema Novo was initially \"as fluid and undefined\" as its predecessor French New Wave, it required that filmmakers have a passion for cinema, a desire to use it to explain \"social and human problems,\" and a willingness to individualize their work.\n\nAuteur theory also greatly influenced Cinema Novo. Although its three phases were distinct, Cinema Novo encouraged directors to emphasize their personal politics and stylistic preferences. As Cinema Novo filmmaker Joaquim Pedro de Andrade explained to Viany in a 1966 interview:\n\nIn our films, the propositions, positions, and ideas are extremely varied, at times even contradictory or at least multiple. Above all they are increasingly free and unmasked. There exists a total freedom of expression. ... At first glance this would seem to indicate some internal incoherence within the Cinema Novo movement. But in reality I think it indicates a greater coherence: a more legitimate, truthful, and direct correspondence between the filmmaker--with his perplexities, doubts, and certainties--and the world in which he lives.\n\nClass struggle also informed Cinema Novo, whose strongest theme is the \"aesthetic of hunger\" developed by premiere Cinema Novo filmmaker Glauber Rocha in the first phase. Rocha wished to expose how different the standard of living was for rich South Americans and poor South Americans. In his 1965 essay \"The Esthetic of Hunger,\" Rocha stated that \"the hunger of South America is not simply an alarming symptom: it is the essence of our society. ... [Cinema Novo's] originality is [South Americans'] hunger[,] and our greatest misery is that this hunger is felt but not intellectually understood.\" On this note, Wheeler Winston Dixon and Gwendolyn Audrey Foster hold that \"[t]he Marxist implications of [Rocha's] cinema are hard to miss\".\n\nMost film historians divide Cinema Novo into three sequential phases that differ in theme, style and subject matter. Stam and Johnson identify \"a first phase going from 1960 to 1964,\" a second phase running \"from 1964 to 1968,\" and a third phase running \"from 1963 to 1972\" (though they also claim the final phase concludes at \"roughly\" \"the end of 1971\"). There is little disagreement among film critics about this time frame.\n\nFilmmaker Carlos Diegues claims that while lack of funds lowered the technical precision of Cinema Novo films, it also allowed directors, writers and producers to have an unusual amount of creative freedom. \"Because Cinema Novo is not a school, it has no established style,\" states Diegues. \"In Cinema Novo, expressive forms are necessarily personal and original without formal dogmas\". This directorial freedom, along with the changing social and political climate in Brazil, caused Cinema Novo to experience shifts in form and content in a short amount of time.\n\nFilms of the first phase represent the original motivation and goals of Cinema Novo. First-phase films were earnest in tone and rural in setting, dealing with social ills that affected the working class like starvation, violence, religious alienation and economic exploitation. They also addressed the \"fatalism and stoicism\" of the working class, which discouraged it from working to fix these problems. \"The films share a certain political optimism,\" write Johnson and Stam, \"a kind of faith that merely showing these problems would be a first step toward their solution.\"\n\nUnlike traditional Brazilian cinema that depicted beautiful professional actors in tropical paradises, first-phase Cinema Novo \"searched out the dark corners of Brazilian life--its \"favelas\" and its \"sertão\"--the places where Brazil's social contradictions appeared most dramatically.\" These topics were supported by aesthetics that \"were visually characterized by a documentary quality, often achieved by the use of a hand-held camera\" and were shot \"in black and white, using simple, stark scenery that vividly emphasized the harshness of the landscape\". Diegues contends that first-phase Cinema Novo did not focus on editing and shot-framing but rather on spreading a proletariat philosophy. \"Brazilian filmmakers (principally in Rio, Bahia, and São Paulo) have taken their cameras and gone out into the streets, the country, and the beaches in search of the Brazilian people, the peasant, the worker, the fisherman, the slum dweller.\"\n\nMost film historians agree that Glauber Rocha, \"one of the most well-known and prolific filmmakers to emerge in the late 1950s in Brazil\", was the most powerful advocate for Cinema Novo in its first phase. Dixon and Foster contend that Rocha helped initiate the movement because he wanted to make films that educated the public about social equality, art and intellectualism, which Brazilian cinema at the time did not do. Rocha summarized these goals by claiming his films used \"aesthetics of hunger\" to address class and racial unrest. In 1964, Rocha released \"Deus e o Diabo na Terra do Sol\" (\"Black God, White Devil\"), which he wrote and directed to “suggest that only violence will help those who are sorely oppressed\".\n\nWith Rocha at the helm during its first phase, Cinema Novo was praised by critics around the world.\n\nIn 1964, popular Democratic President João Goulart was removed from office by military coup, turning Brazil into a military-run autocracy under new President Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco. Brazilians consequently lost faith in the ideals of Cinema Novo, as the movement had promised to protect civilian rights yet had failed to uphold democracy. Cinema Novo filmmaker Joaquim Pedro de Andrade blamed fellow directors, whom he claimed had lost touch with Brazilians while appealing to critics: \"For a film to be a truly political instrument,\" de Andrade said, \"it must first communicate with its public\". Second-phase Cinema Novo thus sought to both deflect criticism and to address the \"anguish\" and \"perplexity\" that Brazilians felt after Goulart was ousted. It did this by producing films that were \"analyses of \"failure\"--of populism, of developmentalism, and of leftist intellectuals\" to protect Brazilian democracy.\n\nAt this time, filmmakers also started trying to make Cinema Novo more profitable. Stephanie Dennison and Lisa Shaw state that second-phase directors \"recognized the irony in making so-called 'popular' films, to be viewed only by university students and art-house aficionados. As a result, some \"auteurs\" began to move away from the so-called 'aesthetics of hunger' toward a filmmaking style and themes designed to attract the interest of the cinema-going public at large.\" As a result, the first Cinema Novo film to be shot in color and to depict middle-class protagonists was released during this time: Leon Hirzshman's \"Garota de Ipanema\" (\"Girl from Ipanema,\" 1968).\n\nHans Proppe and Susan Tarr characterize Cinema Novo's third phase as \"a mixed bag of social and political themes against a backdrop of characters, images and contexts not unlike the richness and floridness of the Brazilian jungle\". Third-phase Cinema Novo has also been called \"the cannibal-tropicalist phase\" or simply the \"tropicalist\" phase.\n\nTropicalism was a movement that focused on kitsch, bad taste and gaudy colors. Film historians refer to cannibalism both literally and metaphorically. Both types of cannibalism are visible in \"Como Era Gostoso o Meu Frances\" (\"How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman,\" 1971), in which the protagonist is abducted and eaten by literal cannibals at the same time it is \"suggested that the Indians (i.e., Brazil) should metaphorically cannibalize their foreign enemies, appropriating their force without being dominated by them.\" Rocha believed cannibalism represented the violence that was necessary to enact social change and depict it onscreen: \"From Cinema Novo it should be learned that an aesthetic of violence, before being primitive, is revolutionary. It is the initial moment when the colonizer becomes aware of the colonized. Only when confronted with violence does the colonizer understand, through horror, the strength of the culture he exploits.\"\n\nWith Brazil modernizing in the global economy, third-phase Cinema Novo also became more polished and professional, producing \"films in which the rich cultural texture of Brazil has been pushed to the limit and exploited for its own aesthetic ends rather than for its appropriateness as political metaphor.\" Brazilian consumers and filmmakers began to feel that Cinema Novo was contradicting the ideals of its first phase. This perception led to the birth of \"Cinema Marginal\", also called \"Udigrudi\" cinema or \"Novo Cinema Novo\", which used 'dirty screen' and 'garbage' aesthetics to return Cinema Novo to its original focus on marginalized characters and social problems, all while appropriating elements of b-movies and \"pornochanchadas\" to reach a wider, working-class audience.\n\nBut third-phase Cinema Novo also had supporters. Cinema Novo filmmaker Joaquim Pedro de Andrade, who was active during the first phase and produced one of the premiere films of the third phase, \"Macunaíma\", was pleased Cinema Novo had made itself more relatable to Brazilian citizens, despite accusations it was selling out to do so. Referencing Leon Hirszman's \"Garota de Ipanema\", de Andrade praised Hirszman for using \"a popular stereotype to establish contact with the masses, while at the same time ... demystif[ying] that very stereotype\".\n\nBurnes St. Patrick Hollyman, son of famed American photographer Thomas Hollyman, states that \"by 1970, many of the cinema novo films had won numerous awards at international festivals\". In 1970 Rocha published a manifesto on the progress of Cinema Novo, in which he said he was pleased that Cinema Novo \"had gained critical acceptance as part of world cinema\" and had become \"a nationalist cinema that accurately reflected the artistic and ideological concerns of the Brazilian people\" (Hollyman). But Rocha also warned filmmakers and consumers that being too complacent in the achievements of Cinema Novo would return Brazil to its pre-Cinema Novo state:\n\nThe movement is bigger than any one of us. But the young should know that they cannot be irresponsible about the present and the future because today's anarchy can be tomorrow's slavery. Before long, imperialism will start to exploit the newly created films. If the Brazilian cinema is the palm tree of Tropicalism, it is important that the people who have lived through the drought are on guard to make sure that Brazilian cinema doesn't become underdeveloped.\n\nRocha's fears were realized. In 1977, filmmaker Carlos Diegues said that \"one can only talk about Cinema Novo in nostalgic or figurative terms because Cinema Novo as a group no longer exists, above all because it has been diluted into Brazilian cinema.\" Toward the end of Cinema Novo, the Brazilian government created film company Embrafilme to encourage production of Brazilian cinema; but Embrafilme mostly produced films that ignored the Cinema Novo ideology. Aristides Gazetas claims that Third Cinema now carries on the Cinema Novo tradition.\n\nIn 1969, the Brazilian government instituted Embrafilme, a company designed to produce and distribute Brazilian cinema. Embrafilme produced movies of various genres, including fantasies and big-budget epics. At the time, Cinema Novo filmmaker Carlos Diegues said he supported Embrafilme because it was \"the only enterprise with sufficient economic and political power to confront the devastating voracity of the multinational corporations in Brazil.\" Moreover, Diegues held that while Cinema Novo \"is not identified with Embrafilme\", \"[Embrafilme's] existence ... is in reality a project of Cinema Novo.\"\n\nWhen Embrafilme was dismantled in 1990 by President Fernando Collor de Mello, \"the consequences\" for the Brazilian film industry \"were immediate and grim.\" Lacking investors, many Brazilian directors co-produced English films. This caused English cinema to overrun the Brazilian market, which went from producing 74 films in 1989 to producing nine films in 1993. Brazilian President Itamar Franco ended the crisis by implementing the Brazilian Cinema Rescue Award, which funded 90 projects between 1993 and 1994. The award \"opened new doors to a young generation of new film-makers (and a few of the veterans) who were confident that, as the title of a film by Cinema Novo veteran director Carlos Diegues prophetically announced, better days would come (\"Melhores Dias Virao\"/\"Better Days Will Come\", 1989).\"\n\nAccording to Aristides Gazetas, Cinema Novo is the first example of an influential genre called Third Cinema. Like Cinema Novo, Third Cinema draws on Italian neorealism and French New Wave. Gazetas claims that Cinema Novo can be characterized as early Third Cinema because Glauber Rocha \"adopted Third Cinema techniques to bring awareness of the social and political realities in his country through cinema\". After fading with Cinema Novo, Third Cinema was revived in 1986 when English film companies looked to create a genre that \"focused upon Anglo-American cinematic practices\" and \"avoided both the sentimental leftist cultural theory emanating from the UK and the cultural and educational practices in line with corporate cultures and market consumerism that related to variants of postmodernism.\"\n\nIn 1965, Glauber Rocha claimed that \"Cinema Novo is a phenomenon of new peoples everywhere and not a privilege of Brazil.\" Appropriately, Third Cinema has affected film culture throughout the world. In Italy, Gillo Pontecorvo directed \"The Battle of Algiers\" (1965), which depicted native African Muslims as brave terrorists fighting French colonialists in Algeria. Cuban filmmaker Tomas Gutierrez Alea, co-founder of the ground-breaking Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos, used Third Cinema to \"reconstitut[e] a historical past for Cubans.\" According to Stuart Hall, Third Cinema also impacted black peoples in the Caribbean by giving them two identities: one in which they are unified across a diaspora, and another that highlights \"what black people have become as a result of white rule and colonization.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Over the same period, the net FDI increased by bn, so that SOE FDI was almost 14% of the total. Conversely, Canadian SOEs limit themselves to domestic affairs. The SOE of Canada are not aggressive in this manner: Canadian SOEs have no foreign investments.\n\nThe Canadian government is planning to raise to bn the amount of foreign money that can go into a Canadian company before the investment is reviewed. As of 2012, an investment or takeover of a Canadian business by a WTO investor worth mn or more triggers a federal review under the Investment Canada Act. The WTO was implemented in Canada by the \"World Trade Organization Agreement Implementation Act\" in 1994. Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada provides a helpful webpage with this information and explains that WTO members are eligible for mn review-free investment as of 12 January 2013. The WTO maintains a membership list. The information on the WTO \"amount\" permitted by the discretion of the Minister of Industry under subsection 14.1(2) of the Investment Canada Act is published annually in January in the Canada Gazette. The government investigates whether the investment is of \"net benefit\" to Canada, which brings into play a nebulous political definition. Amounts inferior to this limit do not incur political oversight under the Investment Canada Act, so that the foreign investor is treated like any other Canadian investor. This means effectively, that Canada is open to reverse takeover by stealth. Prime Minister Harper clarified this FDI policy area in Toronto on 7 November 2013 when he said that a little wiggle room was needed on foreign takeover rules.\n\nOn 5 November 2013, British Columbia finance minister Mike de Jong reported a successful placement of Chinese RMB$2.5bn in dim sum bonds.

Joseph has been warned in a dream that he must flee to Egypt to escape the wrath of King Herod. An event known as the Flight into Egypt.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 2:14\n\nAs with Joseph's obedience to his dream is immediate and unquestioning. Rapid obedience to God is an important virtue throughout the Gospel of Matthew. The family leaves at night, which was an unusual and dangerous time to travel in that era. This quick departure highlights Joseph's rapid obedience, and also the immediacy of the threat. Matthew again is careful not to describe Joseph as the father of Jesus, only the husband of his mother.\n\nThat the Gospel of Luke does not mention this sojourn at all and rather has Jesus in the town of Nazareth within days of his birth. This has inspired a number of attempts to reconcile the two gospels. At the time Egypt controlled Gaza, only a few miles from Bethlehem. Some evangelicals thus feel that the family merely made this brief, and unremarkable journey, and did not go to Egypt itself. However at the time Egypt generally referred to the Nile Valley and most readers would have interpreted the term much the same way modern readers would. If the author of Matthew was referring to Gaza he was creating something of a false impression. Bethlehem to the Nile Valley is about 150 miles, and the journey would have taken at least a week.\n\nThe Flight into Egypt is a well known part of the Biblical story, and it is one very frequently depicted in works of art. However this brief verse is the only information the canon scriptures give to this voyage. Most of the traditions about this voyage come from the New Testament Apocrypha. These later works have a number of miraculous stories occurring on the voyage with palm trees bowing before the Infant Jesus and the beasts of the desert paying him homage. An encounter with the two thieves that would later be crucified alongside Jesus is also reported. In these tales the holy family are joined by Jesus' nurse Salome. The story of the palm trees makes it into the Qur'an with relating the event.\n\nWhy Matthew includes this trip to Egypt has also been debated by scholars. Stendhal's interpretation of Matthew 2 is that it is a lengthy apology for why the messiah left Bethlehem, a town of great religious importance, for the minor and little known Nazareth in Gentile Galilee. However, the side trip to Egypt does little to advance this argument. One view is that Matthew is presenting Jesus as Moses, but in reverse, to draw parallels with that other great Jewish leader. France feels that the trip to Egypt is part of Matthew's greater interest in geography. France notes that in - the entire Holy Land is described as being aware of Jesus, while the arrival of the magi \"from the east\" in is a reference to Mesopotamia. This leaves out only one major portion of the Jewish world: Egypt. France feels that this brief trip was added to cover this omission.\n\n"}

It opened on April 11, 1936, and since 1964 has been operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). It currently includes two physically isolated networks: one serving the towns of Cambridge, Belmont, and Watertown, the otherthe located in the city of Boston proper. Prior to 1964, several additional trolleybus lines were in operation in Boston proper. Measured by fleet size, the system was the third-largest trolleybus system in the United States at its peak (end of 1952), with only the Chicago and Atlanta systems having more trolleybuses than Boston's 463.\n\nIn the present system, four routes fan out from the Harvard Bus Tunnel at Harvard Square station, running through Cambridge, Belmont, and Watertown. Those lines are the remains of a once-extensive system of trackless trolleys in the area, which was largely formed from former streetcar lines. Additionally, the 2004-opened Silver Line (Waterfront) is a bus rapid transit service using dual-mode buses which run as trolleybuses in the Waterfront Tunnel.\n\nThe first trackless trolley line in the Boston transit system was opened by the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) on April 11, 1936. Replacing a streetcar line over the same route, it was an unnumbered crosstown line running from Harvard station east to Lechmere station. (Substitution of buses for streetcars on the route had been proposed as early as 1930.) Additional lines were opened in 1937, and by 1942, the system had 14 lines, of which 10 were former streetcar lines and four were former motor bus lines. In 1947, the BERy was succeeded by the public Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) as the operator of Boston's urban transit system, and in 1964, the MTA was replaced by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), which remains the system's operator today.\n\nThe BERy was owned by private investors, but came under public control from 1918. It served 13 municipalities of Greater Boston, including Boston proper. The MTA's service area was limited to these municipalities (with the addition of Revere). Following a change of management, the MTA began replacing trolleybuses with motorbuses, starting in 1958. Only four trolleybus lines remained after 1963, all based in Cambridge. Four decades later, the MTA's successor, the MBTA, built the , and that line's opening in late 2004 reintroduced trolleybus service in Boston proper.\n\nAt the trolleybus system's peak, the maximum number of trolleybus routes in operation was 37, with most route running in the near north suburbs of Boston. In addition, there were the disconnected Dorchester and Arborway networks.\n\nPrior to the opening of the Silver Line, a total of 43 trolleybus lines had historically existed, but not all concurrently, making the all-time total 44 with route SL1, .\n\nThe four surviving Harvard-based routes remained after much of the system was converted to diesel and exist, in part, because of the necessity to limit the number of diesel buses in the Harvard Bus Tunnel. Inside the portals, the tunnel splits into two one-way tunnels, upper and lower. The tunnel for eastbound-northbound vehicles is placed on top of the tunnel for southbound-westbound vehicles. The tunnels first opened for streetcars in 1912, and trolleybuses began using them in 1938. Streetcar service using the tunnel was abandoned in 1958. In a six-year project lasting from 1979 to 1985 (coinciding with the reconstruction of Harvard station during the Northwest Extension of the MBTA Red Line), the tunnel was closed for an extensive rebuilding, which included new platforms and a new northern portal ramp.\n\nIn the lower/westbound tunnel, the loading platforms are located on the left side of the roadway, and for this reason the trolleybuses serving this station have always been equipped with left-side doors, in addition to the normal righthand doors, as state DPU regulations discourage boarding passengers from doors facing the wall rather than the platform. Diesel buses serving the tunnel are not equipped with left-side doors, and passengers boarding or deboarding at the westbound stop must cross the roadway to reach the buses' doors. In 2004, the MBTA began receiving a fleet of new trolleybuses from Neoplan USA, to replace Flyer E800 trolleybuses dating from 1976. The newer vehicles are low-floor vehicles and meet Americans with Disabilities Act standards (see MBTA accessibility).\n\nThe vehicles are all stored overnight at the North Cambridge Carhouse, the northern terminus of the 77A route. Trackless trolleys do not run on Sundays; instead, diesel buses cover the routes. \n\nTo expedite passenger boarding through a left-side door in the southbound Harvard Bus Tunnel, the 71 and 73 trackless trolley routes allow free entry for outbound trips, collecting fare upon later passenger exit from the vehicle. Diesel buses lack a left-side door, so on Sundays these buses are boarded in the northbound tunnel.\n\nThe 71 Watertown Square–Harvard Station via Mt. Auburn St. begins at the Harvard Bus Tunnel lower level and leaves via the south exit onto Mount Auburn Street. It heads west into Watertown, ending at Watertown Square.\n\nAt the Harvard end, to turn around, the trackless trolley exits the tunnel and makes a hard left onto Massachusetts Avenue and a right on Garden Street, and then turns right on Waterhouse Street and right on Massachusetts Avenue to return to the tunnel. The Watertown end has a loop on private right-of-way for turning around and picking up/dropping off passengers.\n\nSeptember 4, 1958, was the last day of streetcar service on the 71; trackless trolleys have run since then. On December 22, 2019, additional reverse-peak short turns were added. These trips serve Mount Auburn Hospital and return trolleybuses to the route 72 terminals for its peak-direction-only service.\n\nThe 72 Huron Ave.–Harvard Station via Concord Ave. starts on the upper level and comes out the north end of the tunnel, using the path that the 71 uses to turn around. However, at the intersection of Garden and Waterhouse Streets, the 72 heads west on Garden Street, Concord Avenue and Huron Avenue and south on Aberdeen Avenue to end at Mount Auburn Street, intersecting the 71 and 73.\n\nTo turn around, the 72 leaves the south portal of the tunnel and turns left on Mount Auburn Street. It turns right on Eliot Street, right on Bennett Street and right on a private right-of-way called Bennett Alley to go straight across Mount Auburn Street into the tunnel. At the west end, the 72 simply makes a U-turn across the wide median of Aberdeen Avenue. On Saturday evenings and Sundays, the 72 is combined with the 75 bus and the route extends to Belmont Center as a diesel bus (signed as route 72/75).\n\nStreetcars last ran on the 72 on April 1, 1938; trackless trolleys have been running since then. In March 2013, the route was temporarily replaced with diesel buses to permit roadwork on Huron Avenue and reconstruction of the Conductor's Building in Bennett Alley. It will return to electric operation when construction is complete. However, route 72 was reduced to peak-direction, peak-hour-only service on December 22, 2019 in conjunction with improvements to routes 74 and 75 (which also run on Concord Avenue).\n\nThe 73 Waverley Sq.–Harvard Station via Trapelo Road follows the same route as the 71 in Cambridge. It leaves Mt. Auburn St. to follow Belmont Street, which forms a border between Belmont and Watertown, then continues on Trapelo Road in Belmont to end at Waverley Square, with a loop at the Waverley commuter rail station on the Fitchburg Line. A short-turn loop exists at Benton Square, the intersection of Belmont Street and Trapelo Road.\n\nSeptember 4, 1958, was the last day of streetcar service on the 73 (and 71 and 77A), after which trackless trolleys have run. As a streetcar line, the turnback loop was further west along Trapelo Road at Cushing Square. Streetcars first ran to Waverley Square on October 1, 1898.\n\nIn September 2013, the route was converted to diesel buses for two years to permit diversions during roadway reconstruction in Belmont. Trackless trolley service was restored in December 2016. A small number of Benton Square short turns (added to the schedule in March 2016) continue to operate as diesel buses.\n\nThe 77A is a short-turn trip of the 77 Arlington Heights - Harvard Station via Massachusetts Avenue bus route. It is not a full-service route; it is primarily a designation for route 71 and 73 trolleybuses to run in revenue service while pulling in or out of the North Cambridge Carhouse. The route was originally a full-service short turn route; however, it became less necessary after the Red Line was extended to Porter and Davis stations in 1984. Since January 2005, the only 77A trips are pull-ins and pull-outs to take 71 and 73 buses to or from the carhouse. They are listed in the 77 schedule.\n\nSeptember 4, 1958, was the last day of streetcar service on the 77A, after which trackless trolleys have run. (Route 77 had already been running diesel buses since 1955.) Until around 1967, the route was numbered 82.\n\nThe Silver Line is split into two sections; the diesel-electric hybrid Washington Street section runs entirely on the surface, but the Waterfront section runs through a dedicated tunnel under the South Boston Waterfront, in which diesel emissions would be problematic. Several routes branch out from the tunnel along routings where installation of overhead trolley wire would have been impractical, especially through the Ted Williams Tunnel (as overhead wires are expressly prohibited on interstate highways), so the Waterfront section uses dual-mode buses. The vehicles run as trolleybuses within the tunnel, then change to diesel power at Silver Line Way, and reverse the transition when inbound. Motor buses are not permitted to operate inside the South Boston Waterfront Tunnel due to insufficient ventilation.\n\nFour routes run in the electrified Silver Line tunnel: SL1 to Logan Airport, SL2 to Design Center, SL3 to Chelsea, and a shuttle route which short turns at Silver Line Way.\n\nUntil early 2006, the Silver Line also used some of the then-new Neoplan trackless trolleys until the entire dual-mode fleet could be placed into service. Later that year, the Neoplan trackless trolleys were transferred to the Harvard-based routes to replace the then-remaining Flyer trolleybuses.\n\nBoston's first trolleybuses were built by Pullman-Standard in 1936. Boston Elevated continued to buy its trolleybuses almost exclusively from Pullman, and until 1950 Pullmans comprised the entire fleet with the exception of a small batch of five Twin Coach trolleybuses purchased in 1937. In 1952, Boston had more Pullman-built trolleybuses than any other city, with 438. Meanwhile, 25 ACF-Brill trolleybuses built in 1950 were the only other purchase of non-Pullman trolleybuses until 1976. With several route closures in 1964, the Twin Coaches and the oldest Pullmans were retired, leaving only Pullmans built in 1947–51 in service. These were all replaced in 1976 by a fleet of 50 Flyer E800s. The Flyers were, in turn, replaced by new trolleybuses over the period 2004–06.\n\nThe present fleet is made up of low-floor vehicles built by Neoplan USA and fitted with Škoda electrical equipment. There are two distinct groups: The network serving Cambridge and vicinity uses a fleet of 28 vehicles, while the Silver Line (Waterfront) uses a fleet of 32 articulated dual-mode buses which are extended-length. \n\nThe Cambridge trolleybuses (numbered 4101–4128) were delivered in 2004 and were the first low-floor trolleybuses in North America. The first day of service for trolleybuses in this series was June 4, 2004. The dual-mode, articulated vehicles (numbered 1101–1132) were delivered in 2004–2005 and are also low-floor vehicles.\n\n"}

He became a professional jockey in 1979 and rode his first of three Kentucky Derby winners in 1988. He had nine wins in Triple Crown races, winning the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes three times each, as well as ten Breeders' Cup races. He was also a nine-time winner of the Santa Anita Derby. He entered the United States Racing Hall of Fame in 1997. Combining his U.S. and international wins, Stevens had over 5,000 race wins by 2005, and reached his 5,000th North American win on February 15, 2015.\n\nHis career successes were intertwined with significant injuries and periods of temporary retirement, mostly due to knee problems, from 1999 until 2000 and again from 2005 to 2013. He had an acting role in the 2003 film \"Seabiscuit\". After his second retirement from riding in 2005, he worked for TVG and then HRTV and NBC Sports as a horse racing analyst for seven years, had a brief stint as a race horse trainer, and took a few other acting roles, notably in the TV series Luck, before coming out of retirement again in 2013. In the 2013 season, he won 69 of 383 races and finished the year 12th in the nation in purse earnings, winning a number of significant races including the 2013 Preakness Stakes, the Breeders' Cup Distaff and the Breeders' Cup Classic. In 2014, he rode in the first half of the year, but his knee problems became too severe to continue riding, and in July he announced a \"break\" in order to get a total knee replacement. He returned to riding by mid-October 2014, accepted mounts for the 2014 Breeders' Cup, and rode a winning race by mid-November 2014. Following the 2016 Breeders' Cup, he again took time off, this time for a hip replacement, returning to racing in March 2017. \n\nDue to his multiple joint replacements and repeated returns to racing, \"The Bionic Man\" became one of his nicknames. However, Stevens retired as a jockey for a third and final in 2018 on account of a neck injury incurred after a fall. In 2019, he returned to being a sportscaster, working as a racing analyst for Fox Sports.\n\nStevens was born in Caldwell, Idaho, the youngest of three sons born to Ron and Barbara Stevens. Ron was a race horse trainer who worked with both Thoroughbreds and American Quarter Horses. Stevens grew up around horses and first rode when he was three years old, assisted by his mother, who had been a rodeo queen. As a seven-year-old child, Stevens had to wear a brace for 19 months due to a degenerative disease of the hip, Perthes syndrome. He began helping his father as a horse groom at the age of eight. In high school, Stevens was a wrestler with potential to obtain college athletic scholarships. However, he dropped out of school in 1979 to pursue a career as a jockey. \nStevens has been married three times and has five children, four from his first marriage and one from his third. He became a grandfather in 2012.\n\nOne of his older brothers, Scott, became a professional jockey, and at age 12 Stevens had decided to do the same. By the time he was 14, he was riding American Quarter Horses at small bush tracks. At age 16 he switched to Thoroughbreds, and at 17 won his first race at Les Bois Park, in Boise, Idaho on Little Star, a horse trained by his father. After leaving high school, he spent four months in southern California working for horse trainer Chuck Taliaferro, who had helped develop other young jockeys, including Steve Cauthen and Cash Asmussen. He returned to Boise for about a year, then rode from 1981 to 1982 at Portland Meadows, where he won two awards for his race riding. He went on to Longacres, near Seattle, Washington from 1982 through 1984, where he won 524 times, including a number of graded stakes races, broke numerous riding records and was the leading rider two years in a row.\n\nReturning to Southern California in 1984, he began winning Grade I races and rode his first Kentucky Derby on Tank's Prospect in 1985. Stevens' first win in a Triple Crown race was the 1988 Kentucky Derby on the filly Winning Colors. He went on to win the Kentucky Derby again in 1995 and 1997, the Preakness Stakes in 1997, 2001 and 2013, and Belmont Stakes in 1995, 1998 and 2001. He fell short of winning the Triple Crown in 1997 when he won the Derby and Preakness with Silver Charm but came in second in the Belmont. The following year, he picked up his second Belmont win on Victory Gallop, in turn denying a Triple Crown to Real Quiet. In 1993 he became the youngest jockey in history to surpass the $100 million earnings mark and was the fourth youngest jockey to be inducted into the Horse Racing Hall of Fame when he was given that honor in 1997.\n\nHe won the Santa Anita Derby nine times, and won eleven Breeders' Cup races, making him the seventh-leading money winner in Breeders' Cup history .\n\nAt the time of his 2005 temporary retirement, his mounts had collected over $221 million with 4,888 winners in North America, ranking Stevens fifth in all-time winnings at the time. He had over 5,000 wins in 2005 when including overseas victories, including 49 wins in the UK, 55 races in France, and 20 victories in Hong Kong. Stevens considers his 5,000th win to have been in the Gaviola Stakes on October 30, 2005.\n\nComing back in 2013, he won the Preakness Stakes on Oxbow and added additional wins to his lifetime total, including an international victory in the Shergar Cup at Ascot Racecourse that raised his total win record in the United Kingdom to 50. By 2014, his earnings stood at $236,951,490 and his North American wins were at 4,988. he had 139 international wins in six nations in addition to his North American records. He reached his official 5,000th North American win at Santa Anita Park on February 13, 2015 on a horse named Catch a Flight, trained by Richard Mandella.\nHe retired briefly from racing for ten months in 1999–2000 due to knee problems, but returned after a rest and credited what was his first comeback to the use of nutraceutical supplements containing glucosamine and chondroitin. In 2002, Stevens wrote a book about his life up to that point titled \"The Perfect Ride\". Hall of Fame sportscaster Jack Whitaker described it as: \"a great read, not only for horse racing fans, but for anyone interested in how the American dream really works.\"\n\nIn November 2005, Stevens announced a second retirement. His decision was again linked to knee problems, but he reached it a week after Rock Hard Ten, who he rode to a second-place in the 2004 Preakness Stakes, was retired due to a foot injury. Describing the horse at the time as the best horse he had ever ridden, Stevens said, \"He's retiring, I'm retiring.\" Stevens rode his last races of that year on November 26 at Churchill Downs. During his retirement, in addition to sportscasting and television work, Stevens worked as a jockey agent in 2007, representing Corey Nakatani. In 2009, Stevens also became a horse trainer with the assistance of his son, T.C. Stevens, based at Santa Anita.\n\nIn the 2003 movie \"Seabiscuit\", Stevens played jockey George Woolf, receiving generally positive reviews. He was recruited for the role in 2002 by the director, Gary Ross, and worked for four months on the film. He had assorted small parts in other works, including brief appearances in the TV series Jockeys and Wildfire In 2011 he became a regular cast member on the HBO television series \"Luck\" produced by Thoroughbred owner David Milch, starring as an on-the-skids jockey named Ronnie. The cancellation of the show in 2012 prior to the beginning of its second season turned out to provide Stevens with the inspiration to return to actual race riding.\n\nStevens started working in January 2006 as a racing analyst with TVG. Also that month he joined NBC Sports as its lead horse racing analyst. He started a new job as a racing commentator for HRTV in 2008.\n\nOn January 3, 2013, Stevens announced that he was coming out of retirement to ride horses as a professional jockey again. He was named to ride a horse at Santa Anita Park on January 6.\nOn January 12, 2013, Stevens won the first race of his comeback in a maiden race aboard the filly Branding.\n\nStevens' first graded stakes win of his comeback came in the 2013 San Marcos Stakes on Slim Shadey. He reconnected with D. Wayne Lukas for the Triple Crown series on a horse named Oxbow. The team finished sixth in the 2013 Kentucky Derby, and on May 18, 2013, Stevens and Oxbow won the 2013 Preakness Stakes, his third Preakness win, and on the same day won the Dixieland Stakes on the undercard with the Lukas-trained Skyring. After a second-place finish in the Belmont, Stevens continued to ride regularly the rest of the year, and on November 1–2 at Santa Anita Park, Stevens won his third Breeders' Cup Distaff with Beholder as well as his first Breeders' Cup Classic aboard Mucho Macho Man. His Classic win was the first in 15 total attempts, and he was the only jockey to have ridden in both the first Breeders' Cup in 1984 and in the 30th in 2013. He finished the year 12th in the nation by earnings with 69 wins from 383 races and his lifetime wins total stood at 4,957. HIs wins for 2013 included 18 graded stakes victories. 2013 marked Stevens' third most successful year since 2000, comparing favorably to his 23 graded stakes wins from 487 starts and 94 wins in 2005 and 532 starts with 99 wins with 22 graded stakes wins in 2001.\n\nIn 2014, he had 145 starts and 31 wins, finishing in the top three 54% of the time in the first half of the year, but his knee problems became too severe to continue riding and by July, he announced a \"break\" in order to have knee replacement surgery. He stated a hope he could return to riding because he was otherwise in good athletic condition. He stated, \"In my mind, I'm not finished.\" Coincidentally, in the same week, Mucho Macho Man was retired from racing, marking the second time a Stevens break coincided with the retirement of a horse he had ridden to racing success. Following surgery in late July 2014, he returned to riding in morning workouts in mid-October 2014 and accepted mounts for the 2014 Breeders' Cup in the Juvenile Fillies Turf and Breeders' Cup Sprint.\n\nStevens' career as a jockey has been punctuated by a number of significant injuries. His first major accident was a starting gate training incident in 1985 when a horse threw him into the rail, putting him into a coma for 16 hours and causing serious injuries to his shoulder and right knee. In 2003, he suffered major injuries in the Arlington Million when his horse, in first place, spooked at the finish line, throwing him in front of the rest of the field, where one horse stepped on him, resulting in a collapsed lung and neck injuries. He returned to racing 19 days later. Over the years, he had gone through approximately a dozen medical procedures on his right knee and three on his left, mostly arthroscopic surgeries. In addition to his knee problems, he also had assorted surgeries on his right wrist and both shoulders.\n\nBy 2014, his right knee required a total knee replacement. Medical testing revealed he also had been riding with a completely torn ACL. Following surgery, Stevens stated that he developed an addiction to the prescription painkillers he was given, so he isolated himself for a week and went off the medication cold turkey, after which he felt that he finally began to fully recover from the surgery. Three months after the operation, he returned to racing, working horses in the morning, and accepted mounts for the 2014 Breeders' Cup. On November 22, he won his first race following his surgery, an allowance optional claiming race at Del Mar racetrack. He returned to graded stakes-winning form with a Grade II win in the Grade II Arcadia Handicap on January 31, 2015 and achieved his 5,000th North American win on February 13, 2015.\n\nIn late December 2016, Stevens had hip replacement surgery on his left hip. He anticipated a recovery time of about 12 weeks, after which he declared that he intended to return to racing, but indicated that 2017 might be his last year of racing, with the caveat, \"unless I come up with a really good 2-year-old who looks like he'll be a major contender for the 2018 Kentucky Derby.\" He returned to race riding on March 10, and rode a winning horse on March 11, 2017. Due to his multiple joint replacements, \"The Bionic Man\" became one of his nicknames.\n\nOn November 20, 2018 Stevens announced he was retiring as a jockey for good due to a neck injury that resulted from an accident at Del Mar on November 17. What was initially believed to be a pinched nerve turned out to be more serious. “[T]he C-4 is up against the spinal cord,” he said, “There won’t be any comeback from this one.” He made the decision after doctors informed him that the spinal injury could lead to a far more serious issue if he were to ever fall again. In 2019, he returned to being a sportscaster, working as a racing analyst for Fox Sports.\n\nStevens has won numerous awards and prizes in the horse racing industry, including the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award in 1996. In 1997, Stevens entered the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame and in 1998, he was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Jockey in the United States. In 1999, he was voted the Mike Venezia Memorial Award for \"extraordinary sportsmanship and citizenship\". In 2003, he was a member of the first group of inductees to the Washington Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame. James Risch, Governor of Idaho, proclaimed the week of July 10, 2006, to be Gary Stevens Week. In 2013, he won the Big Sport of Turfdom award from the Turf Publicists of America, recognizing his contributions to the enhancement of Thoroughbred racing news coverage. He was also nominated for that year's Eclipse Award, and his contributions to the success of Mucho Macho Man were noted when that horse was the recipient of the 2013 Secretariat Vox Populi Award.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1910012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910012", "title": "Amestigon", "text": "Amestigon\n\nAmestigon is one of Austria's oldest black metal bands. It was founded in 1993 by Tharen (Also of Dargaard and Dominion III) and Thurisaz. Both had been a part of the black metal band Abigor and members of this band still contribute as guest musicians on recordings on Amestigon releases.\n\nThe band began by recording two demos, titled \"Mysterious Realms\" and \"Through The Ages We Preserve...\". Both were recorded onto cassette format. These demos were enough to get them signed onto Napalm Records and a split CD with the folk metal band Angizia was made as their debut release. Also entitled \"Mysterious Realms\", the split CD was released in 1996.\n\nHowever the band themselves were experiencing difficulties, and maintaining a constant line-up proved a problem. After releasing the mini-CD \"Höllentanz\" in 1997, the band decided to part ways. This split also marked the end of their relationship with Napalm Records.\n\nTharen went on to form the innovative neoclassical band Dargaard, and the industrial band Dominion III, but in 1998 his interest in black metal was rekindled and he decided to reform the band. He got in touch with Herr Wolf who agreed to join the band in winter 1998 on guitars; shortly thereafter, Silenius (vocals) and Lanz (guitar and bass) completed the line-up with Tharen on drums and keyboards. Thurisaz left the band to eventually take over vocal and bass guitar responsibilities for Abigor.\n\nThe band released a promotional CD in 2000 titled \"Remembering Ancient Origins\"; it was a collection of songs previously unreleased from 1995 to 1999. It was limited to 100 copies and was released by the band personally with no record label involvement. This CD is now out of print.\n\nThe band's most recent release is a split CD with Hellbound, entitled \"Nebelung, 1384\", released in 2002 through their new label Millennium Metal Music. At this time there is no new news about any future releases, except a short news piece on their official site that mentions two new mini-CD projects.\n\nTharen recently commented that the band may well be coming to an end soon. He claims that the band have not had contact in a while, and have not been working on new material. However he claims to be in communication with Thurisaz again after the split, and a possibility of a new line-up may be announced soon.\n\nHowever, in 2009 the first full-length \"Sun of all Suns\" was released.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1910015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910015", "title": "Che Kung Miu", "text": "Che Kung Miu\n\nChe Kung Miu (), also called Che Kung Temple, are temples dedicated to Che Kung, who was a general during the Southern Song Dynasty (1127–1279) in ancient China. He is believed by some worshipers to have been involved in the attempt to keep the Song state alive by bringing Prince Ping and his brother to the South. There are two temples dedicated to Che Kung in Hong Kong: one in Sha Tin and one in Ho Chung. Other temples in Hong Kong are partly dedicated to Che Kung.\n\nThe Che Kung Miu near Tai Wai, in Sha Tin District, New Territories, is the best known example in Hong Kong. During the second and the third days of Lunar New Year, thousands of people go to this temple to worship, including many local Hong Kong government officials. This temple, on Che Kung Miu Road (), is located midway between Tai Wai and Che Kung Temple stations of the MTR.\n\nAccording to as story, during an epidemic that broke out in Sha Tin in the late Ming dynasty (1368–1644), possibly the epidemic of 1629, local residents found out from historical writings that Che Kung was not only merited for his successful suppression of uprisings, but was also known for clearing epidemics wherever he set foot in. People therefore built a temple to house Che Kung in Sha Tin, and the epidemic subsided on the day the construction of the temple was completed. According to oral traditions, the Che Kung Temple at Sha Tin was founded from Ho Chung, when the god was \"invited\" from the existing Che Kung Temple in Ho Chung to Sha Tin.\n\nThe original temple was first built at the end of the Ming Dynasty and was renovated in 1890, 1993 and 2004. The external walls are now plastered with false brick lines and the roofs with green glazed ceramic tiles. The recent renovation is considered to have \"very much diminished the authenticity of temple\". Due to the high number of worshipers during the Che Kung Festival following the Lunar New Year, a new temple was built in 1994 in front of the original one. The original temple has been preserved in-situ; it is only occasionally open to the public. It is classified as a Grade II historic building since 1987.\n\nThe current Che Kung temple, in Japanese-style, was built in 1993–1994 at a cost of HK$48 million. It is eight times the size of the old one. The main hall contains a giant statue of Che Kung. Next to it is a fan-bladed wheel of fortune, which, worshippers believe, will bring good luck when turned three times. Fortune-tellers can be found within the temple.\n\nThe Che Kung Temple in Tai Wai was built and initially managed by Tin Sam village of Tai Wai. The village lost its managerial rights in the late 19th century in a lawsuit against the Kau Yeuk (, \"Alliance of Nine\" [villages]), a regional organization of various groups in Sha Tin Valley, since the latter had provided evidence that it made significant contributions to the renovation of the temple. The temple was subsequently jointly managed by nine villages of Sha Tin, while Tin Sam Village continued to enjoy some privileges in the worship of Che Kung. Since 1936, the temple has been administered by the Chinese Temples Committee. Admission to the temple is free, but it is customary for visitors to donate money to support the maintenance of the temple. Its opening hours are 7:00am to 6:00pm daily. Since 2013, the courtyard of the temple can be visited with Google Street View.\n\nSituated on the banks of the Ho Chung River, and half a mile from Ho Chung Village in Sai Kung District, the temple is one of the oldest in Hong Kong and worship General Che, his son and his grandson. Initially built in the mid-16th century, the temple predates its popular counterpart near Tai Wai in Sha Tin District, which is said to worship the grandson of General Che. The present temple structure probably dates largely from 1878, while the temple furniture probably dates from the Xianfeng era (1850–1861).\n\nIt is great place to be for Chinese New Year, as the spirit of Che Kung is celebrated alongside memories of family members that have passed to the next life.\n\nOther deities worshipped at the temple include Hung Shing, Tin Hau and Choi Pak Shing Kun ().\n\nRun by villagers for over 300 years, the temple is now being kept by Wan Sai Cheung of the Wan family who have been residents in Ho Chung village for many generations. While the temple has been renovated several times, it is considered that \"the authenticity [of the building] is in general kept\". Known renovation dates include 1908, 1994 and 2002, while other sources also mention 1934 and 2000. It was listed as a Grade II historic building in 1996, and as a Grade I historic building in 2009.\n\nI Shing Temple () in Tung Tau Wai, Wang Chau, is dedicated to Hung Shing and Che Kung. Built in 1718, it was declared a monument in 1996.\n\nOther temples in Hong Kong are partly dedicated to Che Kung. These include:\n\nThere are four annual Che Kung Festivals ():\n\nChe Kung festival or the Birthday of Che Kung is the day when people celebrate the birth of Che Kung. On this day, people, especially Hongkongers, would like to go to Che Kung Temple and worship Che Kung. Che Kung was a military commander in Southern Song dynasty. He protected the Emperor Bing of Song to escape Mongol invaders and considered as loyalty to the emperors.\n\nThe real birthday of Che Kung is 2 January in the Chinese lunar calendar. Nevertheless, people prefer the next day to celebrate his birthday.\n\nThey are:\n\nApart from the ceremony carried in the above hall, there are other practices to be done in the subordinate halls e.g. Tai Sui (太歲), Cai Shen (財神). For believers who are students, they often write down their name and wishes on a praying paper, and stick it onto a board called Jinbang timing board (金榜題名板) to pray for better academic achievements. To express their respect to Che Kung, believers may donate to the temple (添香油). Divination (求籤) is also practised in Che Kung Temple as a way of fortune-telling.\n\nOn the Che Kung festival in 2014, 65 thousand people went to Che Kung.\nBelievers think practising divination in Che Kung temple has made accurate predictions in the past. The first time was in 2003, Minister of Home Affairs Dr Patrick Ho Chi-ping on behalf of the city pulled out the worst possible bamboo stick in the temple on the Birthday of Che Kung. In the same year, Hong Kong was hit by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak.\n\nTherefore, the person on behalf of Hong Kong practising divination on the Birthday of Che Kung has changed to Lau Wong Fat, the minister of Heung Yee Kuk since 2004.\n\nThe Birthday of Che Kung also relates to some political controversy. In the event of Hong Kong Express Rail Link controversy, about 20 post-80s generation anti-rail representatives joined the Hong Kong Government Lunar New year kau cim tradition at Che Kung temple, Sha Tin to draw three divination sticks as a way of demonstration to express their anger towards Hong Kong government.\n\nChe Kung is famous for his power to suppress chaos and his supreme ability to cure diseases. Precisely because of the abilities of Che Kung, he was soon revered as a \"God\" and has been considered as a \"God of protection\". Consequently, his followers and worshipers constructed a temple specifically for Che Kung in order to praise his power and good deeds.\n\nMoreover, there are four festival seasons of Che Kung’s birthday in Lunar Calendar (including 2/1, 27/3, 6/6 and 16/8). Since the first festival season falls on the Lunar New Year holiday, believers have dedicated the third day of the Lunar New Year as an annual event to worship Che Kung, and the celebration is known as \"The Birthday of Che Kung\" nowadays.\n\nDevotees choose to burn incense sticks. Burning incense sticks is a common phenomenon during the festival, because the process of burning incense sticks and the rising smoke symbolizes the appreciation of the devotees to the blessing and protection from Che Kung of the previous year. Devotees would also tell their living problems to Che Kung and hope that he will fulfill their wish. It is believed that their wishes will be carried up to heaven to Che Kung by the smoke of the incense.\n\nPinwheels can always be found next to the effigy of Che Kung, and they are regarded as ‘a wheel of fortune’. It is believed that the one who turns the pinwheel will be granted with prosperity and good luck for the entire year.\n\nIn Chinese culture, worshiping Che Kung is similar to worshiping Guandi, a god widely worshiped within Chinese communities as they believe he protects the entire nation. Both of them were generals protecting their country and demonstrated the loyalty to the motherland and to the people. Hong Kong local residents believe that Che Kung would protect them and their villages as he protected the Song dynasty. Being deeply influenced by Confucianism, Chinese people admire the bravery and uprightness of Che Kung.\n\nOn the 3rd of First Month in Lunar Month, traditionally, Chinese people think it is easy to have an argument with other people and this will give them misfortune. To prevent this curse from happening, Chinese people would like to worship folk god(s). That is the reason why so many people choose this day to go to worship Che Kung and pray for their fortune in the following year.\n\n\n\n"}

He has played a wide variety of music, loosely fitting into several other genres such as hardcore punk, math rock, post-rock, electronica, folk rock and indie pop. Though a multi-instrumentalist (including guitar, bass guitar, banjo and drums), he is best known for his guitar work.\n\nA native of Louisville, Kentucky, Pajo played with three Louisville hardcore and hardcore-inflected bands in his early career. The first band in which he played was called Obscene Routine, after which he performed as guitarist in Maurice, but it was with Solution Unknown that he made his first recording. He rose to prominence, however, for his work with the influential post-rock band Slint. Since the breakup of Slint, Pajo has seldom held positions in other bands for very long, moving from one to the other quite often. As a result, he has contributed to many line-ups, playing and recording with Will Oldham, The For Carnation, Tortoise, Stereolab, Royal Trux, King Kong, Bush League, Zwan, Peggy Honeywell, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and, most recently, Interpol.\n\nHe has also performed and released music as a solo artist using various monikers, as Aerial M, M, and most notably, Papa M. Among his 7\" and splits with various bands, he has released (as Aerial M) 1997's \"Aerial M\", and (as Papa M) 1999's \"Live from a Shark Cage\", 2001's \"Whatever, Mortal\", and 2003's \"Hole of Burning Alms\".\n\nIn February and March 2005 he joined his old bandmates from Slint, Britt Walford, Brian McMahan and Todd Brashear for a reunion tour, and in April released his first solo album not bearing a pseudonym, simply entitled \"Pajo\". The follow-up to \"Pajo\", entitled \"1968\", was released in August 2006.\n\nAround the middle of 2005, he helped to form the band Dead Child, with Todd Cook (from Shipping News, Retsin, The For Carnation, and Aerial M—and who also played guitar on the 2005 Slint reunion tour), Michael McMahan (from The For Carnation, Starkiller, and Phantom Family Halo—and who also joined Slint on the reunion tour), and Tony Bailey (from Anomoanon, The Party Girls, Verktum, Lords, and Aerial M).\n\nIn 2009, Pajo joined the Yeah Yeah Yeahs on the tour for their third album, \"It's Blitz!\"\n\nHe was confirmed to perform as Papa M at the ATP New York 2010 music festival in Monticello, New York in September 2010.\nIn June 2010 it was announced that he would be joining the band Interpol as a tour member. He left the tour early on February 27, 2011.\n\nOn February 12, 2015, Pajo attempted suicide after posting a lengthy suicide note on his personal blog. He survived this attempt after EMS members were able to rescue him.\n\nOn May 1st, 2020, it was revealed that David Pajo was a member of a recording project/band called Household Gods that also consisted of Vern Rumsey of Unwound, Conan Neutron of Conan Neutron & the Secret Friends and Replicator and Lauren K. Newman (LKN) of Palo Verde and LKN Band. The record, Palace Intrigue was recorded at Rancho De La Luna studio in Joshua Tree, CA. Produced by Dave Catching and the first song \"Rest in Power\" was released on the same date.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located on Danforth Avenue, between Chester Avenue and Dewhurst Boulevard, in east Toronto. Named after Asa Danforth, Jr., an American contractor who designed Queen Street and Kingston Road, the area is known for its architecture dating back to as early as 1910, and for its number of Greek restaurants and stores. The area was one of the major settlement areas of Greek immigrants to Toronto after World War I.\n\nPrior to World War II, Toronto's nascent Greek population of about 3,000 was concentrated in the area bounded by Yonge Street, Carlton Street, Church Street and what is now Dundas Street East. It was this area that was the focus of the 1918 Toronto anti-Greek riot.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Danforth saw an influx of Italian immigrants followed by Greek immigrants in the 1960s - many of whom were fleeing political and economic unrest which culminated in the seizure of power by the Greek military junta of 1967–74. In the 1970s and 1980s the Danforth was regarded as the largest Greektown in North America. \n\nIn 1993, the BIA Board of Management's lobbying of City Hall paid off, and the BIA was officially renamed \"GreekTown on the Danforth\". More recently, the area has experienced a wave of gentrification as higher-priced restaurants and bars have moved in, as well as a European-style public square (at Logan Avenue). Greektown on the Danforth boasts one of the highest concentrations of restaurants per kilometre in the world. The neighbourhood is home to local raconteur Tom Petkos, and is mentioned in the Barenaked Ladies song, \"The Old Apartment\", and by critically acclaimed author Joseph Assenza in his novel, \"The History of John\". Several scenes in the movie \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" were shot here, mentioned on free walking tours of the neighbourhood.\n\nSome parts of Greektown are still dominated by Canadians of Greek descent (Greek-Canadians). Greeks constitute the most populous ethnic group in the Toronto—Danforth ward located in Greektown, at 7.3% of the total 100,000 population).\n\nOn July 22, 2018, there was a mass shooting in Greektown that killed two and injured 13.\n\nThe annual Taste of the Danforth is a large food festival held over 2½ days in mid-August. With no admission charge, the event welcomes all to enjoy modestly priced samples of cuisine available at restaurants along the stretch of Danforth Avenue from Broadview to Jones Avenues. Greek food prevails, but there are numerous options, including Thai, Chinese, Brazilian, Indian, Japanese and others. A midway offers games, children's rides, and interactive sports that include a climbing wall, street hockey and basketball. Several stages offer musical entertainment spanning the globe, with one stage emphasizing Greek performers of music, song, and dance. The event has grown substantially since the first Taste, in 1994, when 5,000 attended. In 2008, it drew over a million people, moving to 1.5 million by 2015.\n\nThe street signs in Greektown are in both English and modern Greek.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1910058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910058", "title": "Universities Superannuation Scheme", "text": "Universities Superannuation Scheme\n\nThe Universities Superannuation Scheme is a pension scheme in the United Kingdom with over £67 billion under management as of March 2019 . It has over 400,000 members, made up of active and retired academic and academic-related staff (including senior administrative staff) mostly from those universities established prior to 1992 (staff in the post-1992 universities are mostly members of the Teachers Pension Scheme). In 2006, it was the second largest private pension scheme in the UK by fund size. The headquarters of Universities Superannuation Scheme Limited (USS) are in Liverpool.\n\nIn 1911 the President of the Board of Education established an Advisory Committee on University Grants. This research formed the basis of the predecessor of USS, the Federated Superannuation System for Universities, which was approved by the Board of Education and membership became compulsory for new appointees post 1 October 1913. The basic plan criteria were:\n\n\nHowever, perceived drawbacks of the scheme were that it did not link to final pay, access was contingent on a medical examination, there was no guarantee for dependents, little provision for risk benefits, and no indexation of benefits. Hence it compared unfavourably to the defined benefit scheme already enjoyed by school teachers under the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act 1918. From 1958 to 1969 several committees were established to review the present arrangements. The recommendations for a defined benefit scheme were initially rejected by universities in 1960 and again by a committee in 1964, who concluded it was “unable to make a clear recommendation in favour of either system”.\n\nIn 1969, a Joint Consultative Committee (JCC) for the reform of FSSU was established, and commissioned a report from G. Heywood (the FSSU Consulting Actuary) that included a proposed outline for USS. It was to be a one-eightieth scheme with a three times annuity lump sum, available to new entrants only. No medical examination was required and pensions would not be increased.\n\nA meeting to discuss the structure of USS took place in Liverpool on the 28 December 1970. The proposal for an independent company was approved by the JCC in November 1971, and endorsed by the CVCP in December 1971. The FSSU Executive Committee was “unenthusiastic”. Drafting of the rules began in 1971, with the seventh draft being agreed in August 1973 and circulated to universities along with an explanatory booklet. The scheme was finally introduced on 1 April 1975. The scheme was a 'balance of cost' scheme in which the sponsors bear the risk of default, and specifically a 'last-man-standing multi-employer scheme', meaning that if an employer collapsed, the others would bear its responsibilities to its pensioners, such that 'default would require the bankruptcy of every institution, that is, the collapse of the UK university and research community'. Combined with extensive state funding of the higher education sector, this has been thought to make the risk of default very low.\n\nAt the scheme's inception, contributions were 16% of salary, with employers paying 10%, and members paying 6% plus a 2% surcharge aimed at covering benefits for service prior to the scheme's inception. From 1983 to 1997, the employers' contribution rate increased to 18.55%. From January 1997 to September 2009 it decreased to 14%, and employee contribution reduced to 6.35%. The employer contribution was increased to 16% in October 2009.\n\nThe defined benefit of the scheme was to consist of a one-time cash lump sum of 3/80 of the final salary and an annual income of 1/80 of retiree's final salary, both multiplied by years of contributions. For purposes of calculation, the final salary was revalued each year in line with inflation.\n\nFrom its inception, USS was the main pension scheme for UK academics and senior administrative staff of universities and similar higher-education or research institutions. This predominance was lessened, however, when the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 created numerous 'new universities', whose employees (old and new) remained in the state-run Teachers' Pension Scheme. From 10 December 1999, any employee of a UK higher education institution became eligible to join USS if they wished.\n\nBy 2014, USS had become the UK's second-largest pension scheme, with 316,440 active members, deferred pensioners and pensioners. It was, by this measure, the world's 36th-largest. 374-79 separate institutions participated in the scheme, and its assets were valued at £42 billion. In 2017 it had 190,546 active members.\n\nFew changes to USS's rules were made until October 2011, when dramatic changes were implemented, partly in response to losses resulting from the Great Recession, and consequent increased projected scheme deficit:\n\nThe changes were the subject of 'heated public controversy' between USS's institutional sponsors and the scheme's members, represented by the University and College Union, and involved lengthy industrial action. Researchers did find, however, that 'the pre-October 2011 scheme was not viable in the long run', whereas the post-October 2011 scheme was 'probably viable in the long run', though it faced medium-term problems as the effects of the changes on the state of the fund would take time to be felt.\n\nSubsequent research found that reductions in payout reduced the effective value of making (pre-tax contributions) to USS pension versus having to make after-tax contributions to a private savings by £2.86 billion (£1.86 billion attributable to loss of value fore the member contribution and the rest in loss of return to members from the employer contribution) Whereas young members joining the pre-2011 scheme could expect their net wealth to increase by £181,000 (£133,000 gross) relative to opting out of the scheme, those joining the post-2011 CARE section could expect a much smaller increase: £98,000 (£46,000 gross). An earlier study by the same researchers concluded that the reduced wealth of post-2011 entrants was equivalent to an 11% drop in their total compensation or a 13% drop in their salaries. The researchers nonetheless found that the scheme remained attractive.\n\nDespite the changes of 2011, with ongoing weak economic performance associated with the Great Recession, USS continued to identify deficits, leading to further negotiations, industrial action, and eventually dramatic changes being implemented in April 2016. The key changes were:\n\n\nBy 2017, the scheme had over 400,000 members. The USS scheme reported a technical deficit of £17.5 billion in July 2017, reported as the largest such shortfall in the UK at that time. Under diverse conventional accounting rules, the scheme has been in deficit for several years (see Figure). This varies depending on the rules used. For instance as of March 2010, the actuary estimated the scheme was 91% funded (£3.1 billion deficit) according to the scheme specific funding regime, 80% funded on an FRS17 basis, and 57% funded on a buy-out basis. \n\nThe USS Joint Negotiating Committee therefore made the following proposals, to be introduced after 1 April 2019:\n\n\nUCU, whose objections to these proposals had been overruled, proceeded to ballot successfully for industrial action in an attempt to secure a more favourable settlement for members, leading to the 2018 USS pension dispute.\n\nFollowing the 2018 strike action, contributions from employees and employers increased substantially : Member contributions increased, initially from 8% to 8.8% of salary. Then from 1 October 2019, to 9.6%. Subject to review, this is planned to increase to 11% from 1 October 2021. Corresponding employer contributions increased from 18% to 19.5%, then (from 1 October) to 21.1%, with a planned increase to 23.7% planned for 2021. For members earning over the salary cap (~£58,000), employer contribution dropped to 12% for earnings above this threshold, with the difference (about 9% of salary) being used to pay down the overall scheme deficit.\n\nOn 15 March 2019, in a move that came to be dubbed 'Trexit' (an allusion to Brexit), the Council of Trinity College, Cambridge voted to withdraw the college unilaterally from USS as of 31 May 2019, replacing the USS scheme with a defined benefits scheme, to avoid the college bearing any responsibility for other pensions in the UK higher education system in the event of foreclosures in the sector. USS noted that this development would not in itself significantly affect the strength of the scheme, but that if a further financially secure employer left the scheme, the scheme would be markedly weaker. The move prompted some Cambridge academics to begin boycotting supervising Trinity College students, with over 450 Cambridge academics pledging to withdraw all labour from the college by 19 June. Cambridge University's graduate student union supported the boycott, discouraging postgraduate students from taking up teaching for Trinity. The General Secretary elect of UCU, Jo Grady, published an open letter calling on the college's fellows to change their course, arguing that to do so was in their interest and the interest of the USS pension scheme generally.\n\nOn 21 June, however, Trinity's fellows voted by 73 votes to 46 to leave USS, prompting UCU to consider its second ever national boycott of a UK HE institution.\n\nIn October 2019, as the 2019-20 academic year began, several fellows of Trinity resigned. With the number of staff boycotting Trinity reported as standing at 550, Trinity students began to report difficulty finding supervisors, and protests were staged at the inauguration of Trinity's new master, Sally Davies. The University and College Union was reported at this time as preparing a national boycott of Trinity College. In February 2020, Arundhati Roy had agreed to give Trinity College's annual Clark Lecture in English literature, but withdrew at the request of Cambridge UCU because of the boycott. She did, however, supply her lecture to Trinity in written form, and it appeared on the college's website.\n\nThe scheme publishes detailed annual reports, available online. Returns on the portfolio over 5 years to 31 March 2019 were an annualised 10.09% per yr.\n\nThrough the 1990s and into 2020, the fund's main asset classes were UK, European and US equities; US and UK bonds; UK property; and cash. USS's liabilities are all in sterling and, from April 2006, USS began hedging all foreign exchange risk (having previously hedged none). \n\nIn 2019, the largest asset classes were Listed Shares (40.92%), Other private markets (21%), Index-linked bonds (19.84%) with smaller holdings in fixed income (8.55%), property (5.51%), government bonds (4.85%) and cash (4.49%). The fund is underweight US equities. A decade earlier (2011), the distributions were: 60% equities (UK 23.06%, EU 18.32%, US 18.32%), cash (5%), 10-year UK government bonds (12.3%), UK property (7%), hedge funds (8%), and commodities (8%).\n\nCommercial assets have included Telford Shopping Centre in Telford, Shropshire (sold to Hark Group and Apollo Real Estate), and the Grand Arcade development in Cambridge and Forestside Shopping Centre, Belfast. The latter was bought from Sainsbury's for £50 million in 1998 and sold in 2001 for £70 million. They currently own Moto Hospitality. In 2013, Australian train operator Airtrain Citylink was purchased.\n\nThe scheme has investment costs of .34% in 2019 (compared to 0.32% (32 basis points) total annual administration costs of £124.9m in 2017) , and pension administration costs of £69 per member.\n\nIn 1997, following a sustained People & Planet campaign named 'Ethics for USS', USS established a policy on responsible investment, including appointing an advisor on the issue. The scheme came under renewed pressure from 2015, via the 'USS: Step Up' campaign, which had noted investments in tobacco and fossil fuels. As of 2019, USS offers four ethical investment options. Around 8% of members had taken advantage of these. \n\nIn 2017, it was reported that the USS pension scheme has offshore investments in tax havens. In 2014, USS's highest-paid executive, received a 50% pay increase, to £900,000 and criticism of the high pay of top USS employees grew. In 2018, it was noted that pay for USS's chief executive rose from £484,000 in 2017 to £566,000 in 2018, while two staff members earned over £1m, and running costs stood at £125m per annum.\n\n\n\n"}

FCA was founded in 1954. It has staff offices located throughout the United States and abroad.\n\nThe organization's headquarters are located across Interstate 70 from the Truman Sports Complex.\n\nFCA was founded in 1954 by Eastern Oklahoma A&M basketball coach Don McClanen, who later resigned to become its full-time director. After watching sports stars use fame to endorse and sell general merchandise, McClanen wrote to 19 prominent sports figures asking for their help in establishing an organization that would use the same principle to share the Christian faith. Among the first supporters were Baseball Hall of Famer Branch Rickey, who was most known for breaking the MLB color barrier by signing Jackie Robinson to the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1945, and professional athletes including Otto Graham, Carl Erskine and Don Moomaw. FCA held its first advisory board meeting in September 1954 and was officially incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in November.\n\nAfter two years in Oklahoma, McClanen moved FCA's headquarters to Kansas City, Missouri. That year (1956), FCA also conducted its first national camp‚ then referred to as a national conference‚ which drew 256 athletes and coaches to Estes Park, Colo. The ministry continued its expansion by adding additional camp locations, establishing a national magazine and beginning school campus groups called ‚\"Huddles‚\" within 10 years of the first camp. In 1979 FCA completed and dedicated a new headquarters facility overlooking Kansas City‚ Truman Sports Complex, and the building was officially renamed the FCA National Support Center in 2011.\n\nThe Fellowship of Christian Athletes operates according to an internally written statement of faith. This statement consists of nine points based on Bible teachings and Christian principles. Each point has a corresponding scripture. All staff and ministry leaders agree with and operate according to the FCA statement of faith.\n\nThe Fellowship of Christian Athletes lists four core values for its ministry: Integrity, Serving, Teamwork and Excellence. Each core value has a corresponding scripture.\n\nWhile all students are welcome to attend FCA Huddles, students in leadership are required to sign a Statement of Faith and a Sexual Purity Statement.\n\nIn September 2015, Roanoke City and Roanoke County, Virginia public schools ended FCA ministry to football players following at least two complaints. In an FCA activity referred to as the \"Watermelon Ministry\", the organization had visited public high school student athletes at team practices to offer watermelon slices and tell players that all the talents they have come from God. Two FCA videos from August 2015 of the now-halted program show public school coaches standing behind their team while an FCA evangelist sternly warns them that to be good players they must have a Christian faith and read the Bible. In a third video, numerous Virginia public high school coaches speak about how the FCA helps them recruit students to Christianity. One coach, for example, states: \"We teach them not only about sports and how to live your life, but how to live your life as a Christian. I think that’s really important, for us to just have a chance to relate with all different kinds of kids, not just the ones who go to church, but maybe the ones who don’t go to church. It allows us to draw them in in a relaxed environment and really speak to them about the Gospel, which is the reason we do what we do. We want to bring kids to the gospel and see them follow after Christ.\" \n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation, a national nonprofit organization, referred to the activities as \"predatory,\" \"illegal\" and \"unconstitutional\" in letters sent to superintendents of two of the largest Virginia jurisdictions involved.\n\nSchool officials responded they were unaware that the coaches were hosting the proselytizing, and immediately stopped it. The Roanoke County superintendent stated “Roanoke County Schools believes in the separation of church and state. We want to maintain and ensure that that practice is being followed.” A city of Roanoke spokesman said “When this information came to our attention, we responded immediately. We met with the appropriate people and made it very clear that separation of church and state is the law of the land. We feel the matter is under control and we will monitor this very closely.”\n\nThrough its media office, FCA issued the following response, \"Every student athlete has the right and the freedom to participate in activities according to their individual religious convictions. There are no repercussions for students who decline to participate in FCA activities.\" The FFRF letters, however had noted that repercussions may take the form of pressure from peers and coaches, alienating non-Christian students, and usurping parents' authority.\n\nThe FCA sexual purity statement has been criticized because it includes statements against homosexuality, which must be signed by FCA representatives of the ministry including staff, trustees and adult volunteer ministry leaders. Student leaders sign a Student Leader Application when serving in leadership roles within the organization, but this application does not require signing the sexual purity statement.\n\nSince 1954, professional athletes and coaches have taken part in FCA through ministry events, speaking engagements, FCA camps, volunteer opportunities and ministry leadership roles. For approximately six decades, athletes and coaches from both major and minor professional sports and top-tier college programs have engaged with FCA to communicate their Christian faith and participate in community outreach opportunities. Among those who pioneered the organization were former stars Otto Graham, Branch Rickey, Bobby Richards, Carl Erskine and Bill Krisher. They would be followed by other influential sports figures including Bobby Bowden, Jim Ryun, Betsy King, Herschel Walker, Reggie White, Tony Dungy, Shaun Alexander, Tom Osborne and Shanna Zolman, all of whom vocalized their Christian faith through FCA outlets such as banquets, camps and rallies.\n\nRecent stars who have connected with FCA have included Adam Wainwright, Brian Roberts, Tim Tebow, Tamika Catchings, John Harbaugh, Leah O'Brien Amico, Allyson Felix Colt McCoy, Andrew McCutchen and a number of public figures outside the world of sports such as comedian Jeff Foxworthy, and Duck Dynasty star Willie Robertson.\n\nFCA presents six national awards every year to athletes and coaches who have excelled in specific areas of competition, community service and Christian character.\n\n\n\n"}

It may be long-finned or short-finned with either a triple or quadruple tail. The dorsal fin is high while the caudal fin is often twice as long as the body. The caudal fin may also have three or four lobes.\n\nRyukins come in deep-red, red-and-white, white, silver, blue, black, orange, lavender grey, iron and calico coloration.\n\nThe ryukin is a fine aquarium fish that can reach up to 8 inches (21 centimeters) in length. Some ryukins are reported to grow up to 10 inches in large aquariums and commercial ponds.\n\nThe Ryukin is Chinese in origin. It is unknown when the ryukin was bred but it is thought to come from the Wakin. It has been so named because it was said to have arrived in Japan through the Ryukyu Islands, now Okinawa Prefecture, which lies between Taiwan and Japan. There were historical references that the existence of ryukins dates back to 1833, but it is said to have arrived in Japan in the 1770s. Early Japanese literature refers to the ryukin as the onaga (longtail) or the nagasaki goldfish. In English texts, they are also referred to as the Japanese ribbontail, the fringetail, the fantail or the veiltail.\n\n\n"}

The \"Camelina\" species, commonly known as false flax, are native to Mediterranean regions of Europe and Asia. Most species of this genus have been little studied, with the exception of \"Camelina sativa\", historically cultivated as an oil plant. Heinrich Johann Nepomuk von Crantz was the first botanist to use the genus \"Camelina\" in his classification works in 1762. As a way to reduce fossil fuel emissions, the US Navy tested a 50-50 mix of jet aviation fuel and biofuel derived from camelina seeds in 2010. A study published in December 2016 explained that the current low price of conventional kerosene-based jet fuel makes it cost-prohibitive for commercial airlines to use camelina-based jet fuel. The study said substantial government intervention would be one way to create a market for camelina, by combining 9 percent government subsidy on camelina crop production, with 9 percent tax on the conventional fuel.\n\nThe name \"Camelina\" comes from the Greek for \"ground\" and \"flax\", alluding to its being a weed which suppresses the vigour of flax crops.\n\nCamelina plants are annual or biennial herbs. Their leaves are simple, lanceolate to narrowly elliptic. The flowers are hermaphroditic actinomorphic, grouped in racemes, and yellowish colored. The seeds are formed in dehiscent siliques.\n\nThe first full genome sequence for \"Camelina sativa\" was released on August 1, 2013, by a Canadian research team. The genome sequence and its annotation are available in a genome viewer format and enabled for sequence searching and alignment. Technical details of Camelina's genome sequence were published on April 23, 2014 in the academic journal \"Nature Communications\".\n\nRothamsted Institute in the UK developed genetically modified \"Camelina sativa\" plants that accumulate in their seeds high levels of the longer chain omega-3 oils EPA and DHA, commonly found in fish oils. These plants could provide terrestrial sustainable sources of longer chain omega-3 fatty acids and have benefits for human health and the environment. Field trials were underway in 2016.\n\nFour common species are presented below. However, at least two databanks indicate more species may exist.\nBiodiesel made from camelina has a variety of benefits. First, traditional petroleum or diesel fuel is not renewable resources, the production of these resources is finite. Camelina biodiesel, however, is a renewable resource. Camelina based aviation fuel could save 84% of carbon emissions . Camelina biodiesel can be produced in large quantities as feedstocks are enough. Moreover, camelina biodiesel can reduce the country's dependence on fossil resources, which can ensure the country's energy security. In addition, camelina biodiesel is an environmentally friendly fuel, and it is biodegradable. Besides, the development of the camelina biodiesel industry can bring employment opportunities. The government has given the industry strong support since camelina biodiesel has a variety of benefits. Therefore, camelina biodiesel has policy support. What’s more, the development of the camelina biodiesel industry has brought great economic benefits. According to the investigation, the greenhouse gas emission of camelina biodiesel produced under no-tillage method is lower than that of traditional methods.\n"}

Once there, he found work and with his savings eventually went into the hardware business. His operation encountered financial difficulties and closed leaving Brown to find other employment.\n\nA member of the Unitarian Church, Thomas Brown was an advocate for both social and political reform, supporting the concept of responsible government in which the members of the Legislative Council of Quebec would be appointed by the Legislative Assembly's majority party. Brown also worked to improve social conditions through aid to the poor. Influenced by the republic form of government in the United States, over time his frustrations with the government of Great Britain saw him join the \"Montreal Vindicator\" newspaper in 1832 at the invitation of his friend Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan. Following the death of founder Daniel Tracey, O'Callaghan had been appointed the paper's new editor and with Brown, they continued to espouse the former owner's radical views. Their attacks were especially harsh against the Governor of the Colony, Lord Gosford despite the fact that he had ordered the dissolution of the British Rifle Corps in January 1836.\n\nIn 1833, Brown's wife, Jane Hughes, died. By this time, Brown had moved firmly from a moderate who sought to reform the political system, to a radical wanting to fundamentally alter Canadian society. In 1837 he participated in the Lower Canada Rebellion and was head of the military faction of the rebel group, the Société des Fils de la Liberté, that openly advocating revolution. In November, Brown was wounded and partially blinded in one eye during the street fight between the Société des Fils de la Liberté and the Doric Club but nevertheless, in December he still fought against the British Army at the Battle of Saint-Charles. Defeated, he escaped to the United States where he worked as a journalist in Florida. In 1844, he was granted an amnesty and returned to Montréal where Charles Wilson gave him a job in his hardware store. Brown married Hester Livingston in 1860 and a little more than a year later was given administrative posts in the government. Thomas Storrow Brown died at his home in Montreal in 1888 at the age of eighty-five.\n\n"}

It is from Grand Central Terminal, and the average travel time varies between 33 and 51 minutes (depending on if a train is express or local). With 9,166 daily commuters as of 2006, White Plains is the busiest Metro-North station in Westchester County, the busiest non-terminal or transfer station on the Metro-North system, and the first/last stop outside New York City on most upper Harlem Line express trains.\n\nThough it is not a terminal station, White Plains is one of the key stations on the Harlem Line. Its downtown White Plains location is not far from many businesses and office buildings making it very convenient to commuters and making it a stop for all off-peak trains and most peak trains regardless of terminal location. A short walk from the station is the White Plains TransCenter, a terminal/transfer point for many Bee-Line buses as well as intercity buses (Greyhound Lines, Leprechaun Lines, Short Line Bus, and Trailways of New York) and Connecticut Transit's I-Bus to Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nPace University's Graduate Center is located across the street from the White Plains station, while Pace Law School's campus lies several blocks away on North Broadway. Mercy College, Berkeley College, as well as The College of Westchester are also located within walking distance of the station. The Westchester campus of Fordham University, approximately away, is served by this station.\n\nThis station is located in the Zone 4 Metro-North fare zone.\n\nRail service in White Plains can be traced as far back as December 1, 1844 with the establishment of the New York and Harlem Railroad, which became part of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad in 1864 and was eventually taken over by the New York Central Railroad. As an NYC station, it originally served both commuter trains in the New York Tri-State Area and long distance trains toward Albany, New York and Boston, Massachusetts, via Chatham, New York. As with most of the Harlem Line, the merger of New York Central with Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968 transformed the station into a Penn Central Railroad station. Penn Central's continuous financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority which made it part of Metro-North in 1983.\n\nThe current station house was built in 1987 as a replacement for the previous Warren & Wetmore-built depot originally built in 1914 for the NYC, razed in September 1983. The former was similar to that of the current Poughkeepsie station on the Hudson Line, and continued to operate through the reconstruction.\n\nUnder the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Plan, the station, along with four other Metro-North Railroad stations, would receive a complete overhaul as part of the Enhanced Station Initiative. Updates would include cellular service, Wi-Fi, USB charging stations, interactive service advisories, and maps. The renovations at White Plains station will cost $91.3 million and will be completed by the end of December 2020. The three-phase renovation will improve the exterior, interior, platforms, restrooms, and bridges, and thus, costs much more than the renovations at the four other Metro-North stations.\n\nThis station has two high-level platforms each 10 cars long, but due to renovations, only six cars can open. The eastern platform is a side platform used only to discharge passengers.\n\n"}

The Hambros bank was a specialist in Anglo-Scandinavian business with expertise in trade finance and investment banking, and was the sole banker to the Scandinavian kingdoms for many years. The Bank was sold in 1998, and today survives only in the name of the private banking division of the French group Société Générale.\n\nHambros was founded by the Danish merchant and banker Carl Joachim Hambro in London in 1839 as C. J. Hambro & Son. During the 1850s he was responsible for arranging various British Government loan stock issues enabling the bank to prosper.\n\nAfter merging with the British Bank of Northern Commerce (owned by Enskilda Banken and a number of Scandinavian savings banks) in 1921 the name was changed to Hambros Bank, and the firm expanded. As a result, in 1926 a bigger head office was constructed at 41 Bishopsgate, where the bank remained until 1988. The 1930 depression affected the bank's international business and it concentrated on domestic lending and Scandinavia. During World War II, Sir Charles Hambro raised finance for the Norwegian exiled government and was also the head of the Special Operations Executive.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Hambros became also known as the 'diamond bank' with its thriving activity in financing the diamond industry and its trade. Hambros was one of the top three banks in the Euromarket by the mid-1960s. In 1967 the private banking and trust operations were expanded offshore and new offices were opened in Jersey and Guernsey to take advantage of the offshore tax benefits.\nThe 1970s marked Hambros' expansion into new areas of financial services - in particular, asset management, investment management for third parties, investment funds and insurance. An offshore private banking and trust operation was established in 1981 in Gibraltar to complement the offices in London, Jersey and Guernsey.\n\nIn the mid-1970s the bank was badly hit by the shipping crisis and repeatedly hindered by its relationship with the Norwegian shipping magnate Hilmar Reksten. Under the direction of Charles Perrin, who started his career in the bank as Assistant Company Secretary, the bank defended itself against litigation from his Trustees in Bankruptcy and the Norwegian Government on and off for nearly 25 years, including two substantial out of court settlements.\n\nIn 1986, the Hambro Trust, the majority shareholder in the bank, was dissolved and the family went their separate ways. Lord Hambro (with his children Clare, Charles and Alex) stayed with the bank and Jocelyn Hambro (with his children Rupert, Richard and James) set up J O Hambro and Sons; Jocelyn Hambro and his sons were reported to be successful in their new businesses.\n\nThis resulted in substantially less Hambro family influence in the banking group and, in July 1997, in the promotion of Chips Keswick to Chairman of the Bank and Charles Perrin (of Reksten fame) to Vice Chairman and later CEO.\n\nBy the end of the decade Hambros had 1,400 staff, 900 of whom were based at 41 Tower Hill in London. In February 1998 the Hambros PLC board recommended a sale of Hambros Bank Ltd to the French bank Société Générale, which the majority of the shareholders accepted. Chips Keswick was the prime promoter of the Société Générale takeover together with his Vice Chairman Charles Perrin, who was the last CEO of Hambros Bank Ltd.\n\nSeveral boutiques and spin-offs originated from or arose out of the ashes of Hambros Banking Group in the late 1990s. These included JO Hambro and Sons (Jocelyn Hambro and his sons), Hambro Magan Corporate Finance (JO Hambro and Mr Magan), J O Hambro Capital Management (James Hambro), JO Hambro Investment Management (Rupert, Richard and James Hambro), Rupert Hambro & Partners, Firecrest Hambro (Charles Edward Hambro Jr), EC Hambro Rabben & Partners (Clare Hambro and Eivind Rabben), Duke Street Capital (Edmund Truell, ex Hambro European Ventures CEO) and STAR Capital Partners (Tony Mallin, ex Vice Chairman of Hambros Bank).\n\nGetty Images was formed by two former Hambros Bank Corporate Finance Directors (Mark Getty/Jonathan Klein). One of the largest companies formed by the family was Peter Hambro Mining and Gold - now renamed Petropavlovsk and listed on the stock exchange in London.\n\nSociété Générale sold Hambros PLC, including its private equity and investment side, to Investec, a South African bank in May 1998. The Hambros core private banking activities, which had been retained by Société Générale, was renamed SG Hambros Bank & Trust in November 1998.\n\nIn 2006, the bank was involved with a complex tax avoidance scheme with more than 400 investors, operated by Matthew Leslie Jenner of Jersey-based NT Advisors. Subsequently, the scheme was challenged and shutdown by HM Revenue and Customs leaving the investors facing a £190m bill. The bank was renamed SG Hambros Bank in January 2007. It bought ABN AMRO's Private Banking activities in Gibraltar in September 2008 and was voted Best Wealth Manager for Alternative Investment in the Investors Chronicle Wealth Management Awards in November 2009.\n\nSG Hambros merged with Kleinwort Benson in November 2016 to form Kleinwort Hambros.\n\n"}

These designations are also referred to as NatureServe ranks, NatureServe statuses, or Natural Heritage ranks. While the Nature Conservancy is no longer substantially involved in the maintenance of these ranks, the name TNC ranks is still sometimes encountered for them.\n\nNatureServe ranks indicate the imperilment of species or ecological communities as natural occurrences, ignoring individuals or populations in captivity or cultivation, and also ignoring non-native occurrences established through human intervention beyond the species' natural range (as, for example, with many invasive species).\n\nNatureServe ranks have been designated primarily for species and ecological communities in the United States and Canada, but the methodology is global, and has been used in some areas of Latin America and the Caribbean. The NatureServe Explorer website presents a centralized set of global, national, and subnational NatureServe ranks developed by NatureServe or provided by cooperating U.S. Natural Heritage Programs and Canadian and other international Conservation Data Centers.\n\nMost NatureServe ranks address the conservation status of a plant or animal species or a natural ecological community using a one-to-five numerical scale (from most vulnerable to most secure), applied either globally (world-wide or range-wide) or to the entity's status within a particular nation or a specified subnational unit within a nation. Letter-based notations are used for various special cases to which the numerical scale does not apply, as explained below. Ranks at various levels may be concatenated to combine geographical levels, and also to address infraspecific taxa (subspecies and plant varieties).\n\nNatureServe conservation statuses may be applied at any or all of three geographical levels:\n\nThe most commonly encountered NatureServe conservation statuses at the G-, N-, or S-level are:\n\n\n\nThus, for example, a G3 species is \"globally vulnerable\", and an N2 species is \"nationally imperiled\" for the particular country the rank is assigned. Species with G, N, or S rankings of 4 or 5 are generally not the basis for major conservation actions.\n\nSeveral less frequent special cases are addressed through other notation in the NatureServe ranking system, including:\n\n\n\nNote, however, that regionally native species or other taxa that have recently arrived in the area of interest by natural means (such as wind, floods, or birds), without direct or indirect human intervention, are ranked by the same methodology and notation as for other native taxa.\n\n\nHowever, reproducing or other self-maintaining, population-forming species known or suspected to be of hybrid origin are ranked using the same methodology and notation as for other species. For example, many fertile polyploid species of ferns formed by interspecific hybridization followed by chromosome doubling. Some of these hybrid-derived species are quite rare (ranked G1), but others are so widespread, abundant, and secure as to deserve a G5 rank.\n\n\n\nAny NatureServe rank may be used alone, or G-, T-, N-, and S- ranks may be combined in that sequence, such as a G5N3S1 rank for a particular species (or ecological community) within a particular subnational unit of a particular nation. An entity has only a single global rank (G-rank alone, or G-rank and T-rank combination), but may have different N-ranks or S-ranks for different nations or subnations within its geographical range.\n\n\n"}

Commonly known as vanadium pentoxide, it is a brown/yellow solid, although when freshly precipitated from aqueous solution, its colour is deep orange. Because of its high oxidation state, it is both an amphoteric oxide and an oxidizing agent. From the industrial perspective, it is the most important compound of vanadium, being the principal precursor to alloys of vanadium and is a widely used industrial catalyst.\n\nThe mineral form of this compound, shcherbinaite, is extremely rare, almost always found among fumaroles. A mineral trihydrate, VO·3HO, is also known under the name of navajoite.\n\nUpon heating a mixture of vanadium(V) oxide and vanadium(III) oxide, comproportionation occurs to give vanadium(IV) oxide, as a deep-blue solid:\nThe reduction can also be effected by oxalic acid, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. Further reduction using hydrogen or excess CO can lead to complex mixtures of oxides such as VO and VO before black VO is reached.\n\nVO is an amphoteric oxide. Unlike most metal oxides, it dissolves slightly in water to give a pale yellow, acidic solution. Thus VO reacts with strong non-reducing acids to form solutions containing the pale yellow salts containing dioxovanadium(V) centers:\n\nIt also reacts with strong alkali to form polyoxovanadates, which have a complex structure that depends on pH. If excess aqueous sodium hydroxide is used, the product is a colourless salt, sodium orthovanadate, NaVO. If acid is slowly added to a solution of NaVO, the colour gradually deepens through orange to red before brown hydrated VO precipitates around pH 2. These solutions contain mainly the ions HVO and VO between pH 9 and pH 13, but below pH 9 more exotic species such as VO and HVO (decavanadate) predominate.\n\nUpon treatment with thionyl chloride, it converts to the volatile liquid vanadium oxychloride, VOCl:\n\nHydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid are oxidised to the corresponding halogen, e.g.,\n\nVanadates or vanadyl compounds in acid solution are reduced by zinc amalgam through the colourful pathway:\n\n[[File:Vanadium oxidation states.jpg|none|300px|thumb|\n\n[[Category:Oxides]]\n[[Category:Vanadium compounds]]\n[[Category:Catalysts]]\n[[Category:Infrared sensor materials]]\n[[Category:IARC Group 2B carcinogens]]\n[[Category:Oxidizing agents]]"}

As its name suggests, Palm intended the LifeDrive to be capable of providing all the capabilities and data storage space that a user could possibly need during the course of the day, including contacts, calendar, music, images, video, and applications. At the time of release, the 4-gigabyte capacity that was chosen for this task could not be achieved using the flash memory used by most PDAs, while keeping the cost of the device low enough for consumer purchase. For this reason, a 4 GB microdrive hard disk drive was selected for the task. It featured a separate data partition that could be used as a portable disk drive. The LifeDrive featured Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, the first Palm handheld to feature both. The device came pre-loaded with eReader, Documents To Go, and WiFile software.\n\nThe hard disk used in the LifeDrive was selected by Palm for its fast spinup speed, but delays in application launching were inevitably longer than with flash-based handhelds. Many speed concerns were addressed with a user-applicable ROM update, which was released by Palm in December 2005. One of the first troubles for the Life Drive was when it was taken off of United Kingdom shelves because the device fell short of EU regulations on the use of hazardous materials. Finally, due to its high price, slower performance than other handhelds, and advances in flash memory which led to reduced prices and greater capacities, the LifeDrive did not fare well in the market, and was discontinued on January 31, 2007.\n\nBesides being the first Palm device with a hard drive, the LifeDrive introduced other features that were new to Palm devices, such as a three-position power switch (on, off, keylock), and a dedicated screen rotation button. The new power switch became a feature of the Treo smartphone line; the screen rotation button also appeared on the TX, but was later phased out among Palm devices, with dedicated accelerometers taking over the task of properly orienting the screen.\n\nThe ROM update for the LifeDrive is available at palm.com.\n\nIt is possible to replace the stock 4 GB Microdrive with a 4GB Compact Flash card, improving battery life and operating speed due to the lower power consumption of flash memory and relative speed increased compared to hard disks.\n\n\n"}

The namesake is a square, about 200 feet long, at the foot of Montgomery Street at the Hudson River. This square was created by landfilling the shore at Paulus Hook, and has been a major transportation hub since the colonial era.\n\nA high concentration of highrise office and residential buildings in the city are located in the district radiating from Exchange Place, which since the 1990s has overtaken Journal Square as Hudson County's major business district and become a major business center along the redeveloped waterfronts in the Port of New York and New Jersey. The Mack-Cali building is host to several nesting sites for peregrine falcons. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Fish & Wildlife, maintains a Jersey City Peregrine Cam at some of the sites on the building. The Hudson River Waterfront Walkway crosses Exchange, the other side of which is J. Owen Grundy Park, extending into the Hudson River. The Katyń Memorial by Polish-American artist Andrzej Pitynski is the first memorial of its kind to be raised on American soil to honor the dead of the Katyń Forest massacre. To the south are New York Waterway's Paulus Hook Ferry Terminal, and Goldman Sachs Tower, the tallest building in New Jersey. The Colgate Clock, promoted by Colgate-Palmolive as the largest in the world, faces Battery Park in lower Manhattan. The Dic clock, which is in diameter with a minute hand weighing 2,200 pounds, was erected in 1924 to replace a smaller one that was relocated to a plant in Jeffersonville, Indiana. The riverfront promenade ends at the Morris Canal Little Basin, part of Liberty State Park. To the north is the former warehouse now housing Harborside Financial Center.\n\nAs early as July 1764 a ferry began operating from Paulus Hook to Mesier's dock which was located at the foot of Courtland Street (where Cortland Street Ferry Depot would be built) and where Battery Park City Ferry Terminal is located today. The first steam ferry service in New York Harbor and the world was established in 1812 by Robert Livingston (1746-1813) and Robert Fulton and traveled between Paulus Hook and Cortlandt Street in Manhattan. The ferry dock stood at the head of the important highway to Newark (and points west and south) established in 1795. The ferry in turn influenced the location of the terminal of the New Jersey Railroad, which opened in 1838 running from the ferry dock via Newark to New Brunswick. The railroad purchased the ferry operation in 1853 and in 1858 built a much-needed larger intermodal terminal. After acquiring the railroad in 1871, the Pennsylvania Railroad replaced the terminal in 1876 and yet again in 1888-1892. Passengers could move directly between the trains and ferries without going outside (a similar plan can still be seen today at Hoboken Terminal). The railroad referred to the location simply as Jersey City, and if necessary to distinguish it from other railroads' terminals, as the Pennsylvania station.\n\nIt was probably the street railways, the local transportation in Jersey City, that first needed to identify the location more precisely as Exchange Place.{American railroad Journal Vol 32, June 18, 1859} Beginning with horsecars in 1860, the local network connected the ferry with neighborhoods in the city and nearby towns. An off-street terminal called \"Exchange Place\" was established in 1891. It was almost at the water's edge, across the street from the Pennsylvania Railroad terminal and with easy access to the ferries. Cars with signs reading EXCHANGE PLACE could be seen all over town. In 1901, the privately held land was given to the city by the PRR.\n\nThe Hudson and Manhattan Railroad opened its tunnels from Exchange Place to New York in 1910. Significantly, the station was at first called \"Pennsylvania Railroad Station\", not Exchange Place, but by 1916 the name was expanded to include \"Exchange Place\". By 1926 the H & M station was simply \"Exchange Place\". The Pennsylvania Railroad did not officially give in until some years later, but all the stations, and the neighborhood, were firmly known as Exchange Place by the 1920s.\n\nFor many years the location functioned similarly to Hudson Place, farther up the Hudson waterfront, as a terminus for the many trolley lines which crisscrossed Hudson County, as well as for those which traveled farther, from destinations such as the Newark Public Service Terminal, or the Broadway Terminal in Paterson. At one time more than ten lines operated by the Public Service Railway originated/terminated here. The substitution of rail lines with busses, colloquially known as bustitution, was completed in 1949.\n\nFerry services were also discontinued in 1949, and while the Pennsylvania Railroad service dwindled after the opening of Penn Station in New York in 1910, it did not end until 1962. Following the end of service on the Jersey City Branch, the remains of the large terminal were demolished, leaving a large open space on the waterfront. This and the elimination of other railroad passenger and freight yards along the river during the 1960s and 1970s opened up the land that would be used for redevelopment. The continued use of the name \"Exchange Place\" was based on the Hudson and Manhattan station (PATH since 1962) and signs on the bus routes that had replaced the trolleys.\n\nSince 2000, both a trolley service, in the form of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail, and a ferry service, provided by NY Waterway at the Paulus Hook Hook Ferry Terminal, have been restored. It is also the terminus for several New Jersey Transit and privately operated bus routes. \n\nPATH service from Exchange Place runs east to the World Trade Center, north to Hoboken Terminal, and west to Journal Square and Newark Penn Station.\n\nThree stations of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail in the district are Harborside Financial Center, Essex Street and Exchange Place, where transfer to PATH and ferry are possible.\n\nThe ferry started in 1764 became known as the Jersey City Ferry but after nearly 200 years of service the last regular ferry service across the Hudson ended in the 1960s. Service was revived in 1986 and today ferries are operated by New York Waterway. A free connecting rush hour bus service in Paulus Hook provides a connection between the ferry slip and Grove Street Station for NY Waterway passengers.\n\n"}
{"id": "1910130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910130", "title": "William Harvey Hospital", "text": "William Harvey Hospital\n\nThe William Harvey Hospital is a hospital in Willesborough, Ashford, Kent, England. It is one of the three main hospitals in the East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust area and is named after William Harvey (1578–1657), the Folkestone-born doctor who discovered the blood circulatory system.\n\nThe hospital replaced an older hospital to the west of town that had been running since 1928. It was planned as part of an overall plan to expand Ashford and the surrounding area by relocating people away from London in the late 1960s. The government decided the existing hospital infrastructure would not be able to cope, and set about locating a site away from Ashford town centre, with a proposed area of around and a budget of £7–8 million. Work started on building the hospital in 1973, and it was commissioned in 1977 and opened in 1979. The old hospital remained open as a smaller unit, and by the 1980s it had become a hospital for the elderly.\n\nThe hospital currently employs about 2,500 people and has 476 beds as of March 2012. It includes a shop run by the Friends of the William Harvey Hospital, a volunteer run society that provides basic goods and services to patients and visitors, and has raised £2.5 million in donations for the hospital. The Rotary Suite of the hospital is run by Spencer Private Hospitals, providing private treatments such as cosmetic surgery.\n\nIn April 2014 it was reported that the East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust was looking for a partner to develop a private unit at the William Harvey site and enhance the returns from the Spencer private hospital on the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital site with a contract over the next 15 years.\n\nIn 1978, Keith Speed, MP for Ashford, criticised proposals that some services would require patients to be bussed back to the old hospital when William Harvey Hospital opened.\n\nIn 2000, the press reported that staff shortages at the hospital were putting patient's lives at risk, which drew local MP Damian Green to criticise the management of the NHS in parliament. Green continued to complain about the state of the hospital, noting in 2001 that patients had been waiting in the accident and emergency department for 24 hours.\n\nIn 2013, hospital staff members threatened to quit due to proposed increases in parking permit charges from March 2014. In some cases, the cost of a permit was planned to rise by over £500. One staff member reported that \"Every day on the news there's somebody slagging off the NHS. Nobody ever says anything nice about us. No wonder morale is low here.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1910134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910134", "title": "Sonic Gems Collection", "text": "Sonic Gems Collection\n\nSonic Gems Collection is a 2005 compilation of Sega video games, primarily those in the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series. The emulated games span multiple genres and consoles—from the Sega Genesis to the Sega Saturn—and retain the features and errors of their initial releases with minimal edits. Player progress is rewarded with demos of other \"Sonic\" games, videos, and promotional artwork spanning the history of the \"Sonic\" franchise. While its 2002 predecessor, \"Sonic Mega Collection\", comprised the more popular \"Sonic\" games, \"Gems Collection\" focuses on more obscure games, such as \"Sonic CD\" and \"Sonic the Fighters\". Other non-\"Sonic\" games are included, but some, such as the \"Streets of Rage\" trilogy, are omitted in the Western localization.\n\nDeveloper Sonic Team conceived the compilation to introduce younger players to older \"Sonic\" games. One game they wished to include, \"SegaSonic the Hedgehog\", was excluded due to emulation difficulties. Sega released \"Gems Collection\" for the GameCube and PlayStation 2 in August 2005. Reviews were mixed or average; critics were divided over whether the package would satisfy players. They preferred \"Sonic CD\" and \"Vectorman\", but found \"Sonic the Fighters\" and \"Sonic R\" mediocre, and disliked the Game Gear games. Some were disappointed by the absence of the \"Streets of Rage\" games in the International version and other \"Sonic\" games like \"Knuckles' Chaotix\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure\".\n\n\"Sonic Gems Collection\" is a compilation of obscure video games published by Sega for various consoles, such as the Sega CD, Sega Saturn, and Game Gear. It primarily focuses on \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" games, such as \"Sonic CD\" (1993) and \"Sonic the Fighters\" (1996). It also includes six of the twelve \"Sonic\" games released for the Game Gear. These games encompass various genres, such as platforming, fighting, pinball, and puzzle. Additionally, players can unlock several Sega Genesis games unrelated to \"Sonic\", including the two \"Vectorman\" games (1995 and 1996). Four games in the japanese version, \"Bonanza Bros.\" (1990) and the \"Streets of Rage\" trilogy (1991—1994), are not included in the international version. Each game is mostly identical to its initial release, but some were changed; for example, \"Sonic R\" runs at a higher frame rate.\n\nThe compilation features an extensive museum section in which players can view content—such as promotional artwork, videos, screenshots, and music—unlocked after obtaining achievements. Time-limited demos of the original Genesis \"Sonic\" games and the other six Game Gear games can also be unlocked. In each demo the player begins in the respective game's final level and can play until the time limit is met.\n\n\"Sonic Gems Collection\" was developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the GameCube and PlayStation 2. According to Sonic Team director Yojiro Ogawa, the compilation (and its 2002 predecessor \"Sonic Mega Collection\") was conceived to introduce young players to older games in the \"Sonic\" franchise. While \"Sonic Mega Collection\" focused on the original Genesis games to showcase what made the franchise a success, \"Sonic Gems Collection\" focused on games Sega considered rare and obscure. Although Sonic Team was responsible for \"Sonic Gems Collection\"s creation, they had limited involvement in the development of the games included on the compilation; for example, Sega AM2 made \"Sonic the Fighters\", and \"Sonic R\" was primarily developed by Traveller's Tales. Most of the games included are emulated, but \"Sonic the Fighters\" is a port.\n\nAt the beginning of \"Gems Collection\"s development, Sonic Team made a list of the most wanted games for the compilation. The team considered the games they felt were high quality in graphics, gameplay, and overall nature. \"Sonic CD\" and \"Vectorman\" were considered for inclusion in \"Mega Collection\", but were deferred to \"Gems Collection\". Producer Yuji Naka said storage constraints prevented \"Sonic CD\" from inclusion in \"Mega Collection\". AM3's \"SegaSonic the Hedgehog\" (1993) was omitted due to problems emulating its trackball controls. AM2 assisted in porting \"Sonic the Fighters\", marking its first release on a home console. The Windows versions of \"Sonic CD\" and \"Sonic R\" were used in \"Sonic Gems Collection\". Both games received visual upgrades: \"Sonic CD\"s opening sequence is presented in fullscreen and \"Sonic R\" has higher resolution textures.\n\nDuring development, Sonic Team hoped that each region's version of \"Sonic Gems Collection\" would be identical in content. However, the \"Streets of Rage\" games and \"Bonanza Bros.\" had to be omitted from the North American localization, due to fears of a \"Teen\" rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB). The PAL release was impacted as well. The team also wished to include both the Japanese and North American \"Sonic CD\" soundtracks, but storage and licensing problems resulted in Japan only receiving its respective soundtrack and all other regions using the North American version. \"Sonic Gems Collection\" was announced in May 2005, and was playable at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). It was released on August 11, 2005 in Japan, August 16, 2005 in North America, and September 30, 2005 in Europe. The PlayStation 2 version was not released in North America. Those who ordered the game through Sega's online store Sega Direct received an exclusive \"Sonic\"-themed yo-yo.\n\nAccording to Metacritic, a video game review aggregator, \"Sonic Gems Collection\" received \"mixed or average\" reviews. By November 22, 2005, the compilation sold 200,000 copies outside Japan. In 2006, the GameCube version was branded a Player's Choice game, indicating it sold a million units.\n\nReviewers considered \"Sonic CD\" the compilation's strongest feature, so much that \"Nintendo Power\"s Steve T. and \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" (\"EGM\") said it was worth buying for \"Sonic CD\" alone. Juan Castro (\"IGN\") found that \"Sonic CD\" \"still holds its own against modern platformers\", praising its unique, time-travel oriented gameplay, level design, visuals, and sound. Castro called it one of the best games in the \"Sonic\" series and was no less fun than its original release. Ryan Davis (\"GameSpot\") found \"Sonic CD\" superior to the other games in the compilation, and Tom Bramwell (\"Eurogamer\") declared \"rejoice for \"Sonic CD\"... Just don't rejoice for anything else, because it's mostly rubbish\". Many reviewers were also pleased by the inclusion of the \"Vectorman\" games. Castro called it \"the pinnacle of 16-bit gaming\", praising its melding of boss fights, action, and platforming and saying it aged well. Bramwell and Phil Theobald (\"GameSpy\") agreed.\n\nCritics generally felt \"Sonic R\" and \"Sonic the Fighters\" were mediocre. Castro, Theobald, and Davis compared \"Sonic the Fighters\" unfavorably to the \"Virtua Fighter\" games, with Davis calling it dated and simplistic. \"Jeuxvideo.com\"s Superpanda, in a negative review of the compilation, argued that \"Sonic the Fighters\" was too short and had control issues, but that \"Sonic R\" was on par with \"Sonic CD\" in terms of quality, praising the game's graphics and claiming that it was the compilation's most beautiful game. Castro was less positive: he found its ideas clever and considered it an interesting departure from normal racing games, but thought the ideas were poorly implemented and the controls were awkward. However, he still thought the game was enjoyable and that its soundtrack was unique. Theobald voiced a similar opinion, considering it \"a concept that works better in theory than in practice\". Conversely, Davis said \"Sonic R\"s \"laughably bad soundtrack\" was its \"only redeeming quality\". Bramwell considered it too odd and short to be worth the player's time.\n\nThe six Game Gear \"Sonic\" games were criticized for their uneven quality and poor emulation. Theobald liked that the games were available from the start, but was puzzled why the other six games were left out. He also considered the selection random (\"why \"Sonic 2\", but no \"Sonic\"?\"). Castro was intrigued that they were all on one disc, but thought their screen displays were bad and said \"you'd probably be better off dusting your old [Game Gear] and finding those old games\" rather than playing them on \"Sonic Gems Collection\". Of the Game Gear games, Davis preferred \"Sonic 2\", \"Sonic Triple Trouble\", and \"Tails Skypatrol\", but disliked the rest. He heavily criticized their emulation quality, noting their frequent frame rate drops. Bramwell joked they were present on the disc for \"educational\" purposes. He lambasted their resolutions and encouraged readers to ignore them entirely.\n\nSome reviewers found the compilation incomplete. Davis and Theobald both criticized the exclusion of the \"Streets of Rage\" games in the North American version. Davis stated he preferred them over \"Vectorman\" and Theobald said Sega should have just let the compilation get a Teen rating from the ESRB. Theobald was also disappointed that the compilation lacked \"SegaSonic the Hedgehog\", \"Knuckles' Chaotix\", and the other Game Gear games. Jeremy Parish (\"1UP.com\") said even combining \"Sonic Mega Collection\" and \"Sonic Gems Collection\" would provide players an incomplete \"Sonic\" collection, lambasting the exclusion of \"Knuckles' Chaotix\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure\" and feeling the Master System \"Sonic\" games should have been included, not the Game Gear ones. Superpanda said he would have preferred \"Knuckles' Chaotix\" over the Game Gear games and also considered its exclusion of the Saturn version of \"Sonic 3D Blast\" a disappointment.\n\nReviewers were generally divided over whether \"Sonic Gems Collection\" would leave players satisfied. \"EGM\" summed it up as a \"woefully uneven mix\", but one \"Sonic\" fans should check out if they wanted \"Sonic CD\". Castro said the compilation was \"decent\" and worth its price tag, but was not as solid as \"Sonic Mega Collection\". Theobald found it weak and that only \"Sonic CD\" and \"Vectorman\" would appeal to casual gamers. Bramwell was sarcastic: \"if this sort of thing matters to you, if you still can't bear to unplug your Dreamcast, and you do own \"Virtua Fighter 4\" and all the others and think they're brilliant, this is for you\". When \"Famitsu\" named the best games of 2005, it ranked \"Sonic Gems Collection\" among the bottom of the PlayStation 2 and GameCube releases.\n"}

Gurmant and his wife, Nina Grewal,who represented Fleetwood—Port Kells from 2004 to 2015, were the first married couple to serve in the House of Commons of Canada at the same time. First elected to the Canadian House of Commons on June 2, 1997 for the riding of Surrey Central and re-elected there on November 27, 2000, he represented the riding of Newton—North Delta from 2004 until 2005. Grewal announced that he would not be running in the 2006 federal election over a dispute of alleged offer of patorage with the then governing Liberal Party. \n\nAs a Member of Parliament sitting in the caucus of the Reform Party from 1997 to 2000, the Canadian Alliance from 2000 to 2003 and then for the Conservative Party of Canada from 2003 to 2006, Grewal held the positions of Deputy House Leader of the Official Opposition of Canada (1998-2000), Co-Chair of the Joint Standing Committee of the House and the Senate for Scrutiy of Regulations (1998-2005), Official Opposition Critic for Multiculturalism (2004), Official Opposition Critic for Scrutiny of Regulations (2001-2004), Official Opposition Critic for Canadians Abroad (2004), Official Opposition Critic for Asia Pacific (2001-2004) and Official Opposition Senior Critic for Foreign Affairs (1997-2004)\n\nAt the age of 8 Grewal and his brother were invited to the Vice President's Gallery United States Senate Chamber by Hubert Humphrey the Vice President of the United States. After earning BSc Honours and MBA and working as manager with reputed organisation in India, he emigrated to Liberia, prior to immigrating to Canada in 1991. In Liberia he was a manager, successful businessman and Assistant Professor of Business Management at the University of Liberia.\n\nGrewal wanted to help the suffering people and victims of the bloody civil war with medicines, food and clothes and intended to organize a charity to help in consultation with the office of the ambassador of Liberia. Grewal brothers had earlier written a letter advising the President of Liberia to launch a Green Revolution to grow more food that would help eliminate hunger, malnutrition and poverty. This advice generated some commotion, particularly by a reporter of the Province newspaper in 1995. The article construed that Grewal was an advisor to the military dictator, despite the Liberian Ambassador having issued a letter clarifying the issue. Grewal has denied any such connections to the former government of Liberia. Grewal appealed to the international community to help Liberia and its people.\n\nIn 1991, he emigrated to Canada. Within less than 6 years, he was elected as M.P. for the Reform Party of Canada in the federal riding of Surrey Central, in the 1997 federal election with 17,438 votes. In the 2000 federal election he won by getting 29,812 votes, 51.6% of the popular vote - a margin of 10,300 votes more than the Liberal candidate. However, in the 2004 federal election his margin of victory fell to 500 votes.\n\nAs a Member of Parliament sitting in the caucus of the Reform Party from 1997 to 2000, the Canadian Alliance from 2000 to 2003 and then for the Conservative Party of Canada from 2003 to 2006, Grewal held the positions of Deputy House Leader of the Official Opposition of Canada (1998-2000), Co-Chair of the Joint Standing Committee of the House and the Senate for Scrutiy of Regulations (1998-2005), Official Opposition Critic for Multiculturalism (2004), Official Opposition Critic for Scrutiny of Regulations (2001-2004), Official Opposition Critic for Canadians Abroad (2004), Official Opposition Critic for Asia Pacific (2001-2004) and Official Opposition Senior Critic for Foreign Affairs (1997-2004).\n\nAs a result of his wife, Nina Grewal, winning a seat in the 2004 federal election, the Grewals became the first married couple to serve concurrently in the Canadian House of Commons.\n\nGrewal had introduced a Bill C-284 to allow a bond to be posted to secure visitor's visa, his Bill passed the vote in the House and was referred to Immigration committee in March 2005. On April 6, 2005, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Joe Volpe, asked the parliamentary Ethics Commissioner and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to investigate Grewal following his voluntary statement given to a parliamentary committee. In that testimony, Grewal had stated that he regularly asked those seeking his help in getting visitor visas for their relatives, if they would be willing to post bonds guaranteeing their return. Grewal contends that immigration bonds, as they have been practiced in Australia and New Zealand, could work as a way to prevent spurious refugee claims and illegal immigration; and assist law-abiding sponsors to secure visa for their loved ones to visit Canada without hassle. There is no evidence that any bond was actually signed (or any money exchanged for the bonds). On June 22, the ethics commissioner cleared him of any wrongdoing and stated that he never pocketed any money from the pledges.\n\nIn mid-May, at the time the Liberal government risked losing a confidence vote on its 2005 budget (which was later decided in the government's favour by the speaker, after a tie in the house), the Liberals initiated negotiations with Grewal asking him to vote with the Liberals and join the Liberal Party of Canada. With a Liberal go-between, Ujjal Dosanjh, Minister of Health, and Tim Murphy, the Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister met with Grewal, on three occasions May 16–18, including Grewal's office. There were also 36 phone calls by the Liberals.\n\nIn these negotiations Grewal was offered inducements to change parties in exchange for a senate seat for his wife, a cabinet post for himself, and an apology from Volpe. In response, Murphy and Dosanjh made vague promises of future reward. While these negotiations were going on, prominent Conservative MP Belinda Stronach defected to the Liberals and did receive a ministerial position in the government. In the end, Grewal did not change parties.\n\nUnbeknownst to his interlocutors, Grewal was recording the conversations, a fact that he voluntarily revealed to the public on the evening of May 18, where Grewal publicly accused the Liberals of trying to buy his vote with offers of a cabinet or a diplomatic post for himself and a senate seat for his wife. He had released excerpts of nine minutes of a recording of conversations with Murphy and Dosanjh, in which Murphy suggests that he abstain from the coming confidence vote. New Democratic Party MP Yvon Godin referred them to Bernard Shapiro, Parliamentary Ethics Commissioner and to the RCMP.\n\nOn May 31, Grewal handed over recordings to Shapiro and the RCMP. Simultaneously he released an hour and 15 minutes of recordings and transcripts to the public.\n\nSeveral news outlets and the Liberals alleged that portions of the tape seemed to be edited, something that the Conservatives denied. On June 2, 2005, the Conservatives issued a news release admitting that two short sections had been accidentally omitted. In mid-August, the RCMP announced that there would be no further criminal investigation into the tapes and their contents and Grewal was cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nOn January 25, 2006, Shapiro released a heavily edited report from the draft reports and stated, \"While it is not clear whether Mr. Grewal genuinely sought an inducement to change his vote or whether he just acted the part in an attempt to entrap Mr. Dosanjh, his actions were, in either case, extremely inappropriate\". The report also said that Grewal's behaviour violated the spirit of the MPs’ Code of Conduct.\n\nThe Liberals claimed that it was Grewal who approached them seeking patronage appointments for himself and his wife in exchange for their votes.\n\nGrewal did not run for re-election in 2006, saying he did not want the controversies surrounding his behaviour to be a distraction during the campaign.\n\nGrewal had planned to stand for the Conservatives in the new riding of Cloverdale—Langley City in the 2015 federal election, spending two years to sign up 1,500 party members in his pursuit of the nomination, but in November 2014 he was barred by the party from seeking the nomination.

Once the fruit is ingested in quantity (so a few to many of this tree's berries) depending on its toxicity the person eating it may die after about 24 hours of ingesting the fruits. \"The flowers are followed by yellow clusters of fruit which are poisonous if eaten by humans and animals although many birds seem partial to them and are not affected. Its flowers are a respiratory irritant and its leaves, bark, flowers and sometimes fruit are poisonous.\" \n\nThe adult tree has a rounded crown, and commonly measures tall, however in exceptional circumstances \"M. azedarach\" can attain a height of .\n\nThe leaves are up to long, alternate, long-petioled, two or three times compound (odd-pinnate); the leaflets are dark green above and lighter green below, with serrate margins.\n\nThe flowers are small and fragrant, with five pale purple or lilac petals, growing in clusters.\n\nThe fruit is a drupe, marble-sized, light yellow at maturity, hanging on the tree all winter, and gradually becoming wrinkled and almost white.\n\nAs the stem ages and grows, changes occur that transform its surface into bark (see image).\n\nThe genus name \"Melia\" is derived from (), the Greek word used by Theophrastus (c. 371 – c. 287 BC) for \"Fraxinus ornus\", which has similar leaves. The species \"azedarach\" is from the French 'azédarac' which in turn is from the Persian 'āzād dirakht' (ازادرخت ) meaning 'free- or noble tree'.\n\n\"Melia azedarach\" should not be confused with the \"Azadirachta\" trees, which are in the same family, but a different genus.\n\nThe main utility of chinaberry is its timber. This is of medium density, and ranges in colour from light brown to dark red. In appearance it is readily confused with the unrelated Burmese teak (\"Tectona grandis\"). \"Melia azedarach\" – in keeping with other members of the family Meliaceae – has a timber of high quality, but as opposed to many almost-extinct species of mahogany, it is under-utilised. Seasoning is relatively simple, in that planks dry without cracking or warping and are resistant to fungal infection. The taste of the leaves is not as bitter as neem (\"Azadirachta indica\").\n\nThe tough five-grooved seeds were widely used for making rosaries and other products requiring beads; however, the seeds were later replaced by plastics. The cut branches with mature fruit are sold commercially to the florist and landscaping trade particularly as a component for outdoor holiday décor. The fruits may persist for some time prior to shattering off the stem or discoloring, which occurs rapidly after a relatively short time in subfreezing weather. \n\nSome hummingbirds like the sapphire-spangled emerald (\"Amazilia lactea\"), glittering-bellied emerald (\"Chlorostilbon lucidus\") and planalto hermit (\"Phaethornis pretrei\") have been recorded as feeding on and pollinating the flowers; these only take it opportunistically.\n\nIn Kenya the trees have been grown by farmers and used as fodder trees. The leaves can be fed to cattle to improve milk yields and improve farm incomes. \n\nIn Australia, particularly the suburbs of Melbourne, the tree is often used in nature strip plantings by local councils. The councils plant such trees for amenity reasons as well as environmental, social and economic benefits.\n\nThe fruits have evolved to be eaten by animals which eat the flesh surrounding the hard endocarp or ingest the entire fruit and later vent the endocarp. If the endocarp is crushed or damaged during ingestion or digestion, the animal will be exposed to the toxins within the seed. The processes of mastication and digestion, and the degree of immunity to the particular toxins, vary widely between species, and there will accordingly be a great variation in the clinical symptoms following ingestion.\n\nFruits are poisonous or narcotic to humans if eaten in quantity. However, like those of the yew tree, these toxins are not harmful to birds, who gorge themselves on the fruit, eventually reaching a \"drunken\" state. The birds that are able to eat the fruit spread the seeds in their droppings. The toxins are neurotoxins and unidentified resins, found mainly in the fruits. The first symptoms of poisoning appear a few hours after ingestion. They may include loss of appetite, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, bloody faeces, stomach pain, pulmonary congestion, cardiac arrest, rigidity, lack of coordination and general weakness. Death may take place after about 24 hours. Like in relatives, tetranortriterpenoids constitute an important toxic principle. These are chemically related to azadirachtin, the primary insecticidal compound in the commercially important neem oil. These compounds are probably related to the wood and seed's resistance to pest infestation, and maybe to the unattractiveness of the flowers to animals.\n\nLeaves have been used as a natural insecticide to keep with stored food, but must not be eaten as they are highly poisonous. Chinaberry fruit was used to prevent insect larvae from growing in the fruit. By placing the berries in drying apples (etc.) and keeping the fruit turned in the sun without damaging any of the chinaberry skin, the fruit will dry and not have insect larvae in the dried apples.\n\nA diluted infusion of leaves and trees has been used in the past to induce uterus relaxation.\n\nThe plant was introduced around 1830 as an ornamental in the United States (South Carolina and Georgia) and widely planted in southern states. Today it is considered an invasive species by some groups as far north as Virginia and Oklahoma. But nurseries continue to sell the trees, and seeds are also widely available. It has become naturalized to tropical and warm temperate regions of the Americas and is planted in similar climates around the world. Besides the problem of toxicity, its usefulness as a shade tree in the United States is diminished by its tendency to sprout where unwanted and to turn sidewalks into dangerously slippery surfaces when the fruits fall, though this is not a problem where songbird populations are in good shape. As noted above, the possibility of commercially profitable harvesting of feral stands remains largely unexplored.\n\n\n"}

It is the successor to Czechoslovak Television, founded in 1953.\n\nCzech Television was established 1 January 1992 as a successor to Czechoslovak Television. It is based on Czech Television Act (Act No. 483/1991 Coll.) as a television service for the citizens of the Czech Republic.\n\nOn 1 January 1993, a new concept of channels broadcast by Czech Television was introduced, which were renamed to ČT1 (formerly ČTV), ČT2 (formerly F1), and ČT3 (formerly OK3). On 3 February 1994, Czech Television freed one of the nationwide broadcast channels in accordance with the law; starting 4 February 1994 Czech Television was left with two channels, ČT1 and ČT2.\n\nIn 2005 news channel ČT24 and the following year ČT Sport were launched. In 2013, the broadcaster added two new channels, (children's) and ČT art (arts/culture).\n\nAnd in April 2020 ČT3 was launched targeting the older generation / elderly\n\nThe \"Czech TV crisis\" occurred at the end of 2000 and lasted until early 2001 as a battle for control of the airwaves, which included jamming and accusations of censorship. During the Czech TV crisis, Czech TV reporters organized an industrial dispute by staging a sit-in and occupying the news studio and rejected attempts by Jana Bobošíková to fire them. They were supported in their protest by politicians such as the then President Václav Havel and by Czech celebrities, but every time they tried to air their news broadcasts, Bobošíková and Jiří Hodač would jam the transmission either with a \"technical fault\" screen reading: \"An unauthorized signal has entered this transmitter. Broadcasting will resume in a few minutes\", or with their own news broadcasts featuring Jana Bobošíková and a team she had hired to \"replace\" the staff members she had sought to terminate.\n\nThe Czech TV crisis eventually ended in early 2001, following the departure from Czech TV of Hodač and Bobošíková, under pressure by the street demonstration participants and at the request of the Czech Parliament, which had held an emergency session due to the crisis.\n\nWithin the framework of television operates two television studios. Television studio Brno is based in the second-largest city in Czech Republic and was founded in 1961. The second studio is based in Ostrava and was founded in 1955. In the year 2001, the Czech government stated that TV studios have to contribute to television production in the range of at least 20% share in national television broadcasting and at least 25 minutes of regional news coverage in their area of competence.\n\nCzech Television is well known for its wide contributions to many charities. They are mainly raising money by broadcasting many beneficial programmes. As an example, every year Czech television is broadcasting a beneficial evening of well known Czech charity organization \"Centrum Paraple\" where various artists perform their mostly musical performances. Centrum Paraple is an organization which focuses on helping people with physical handicaps.\n\nCzech Television is creating and broadcasting various educational and awareness-raising programs intended for various age and interest groups. Czech television also cooperates with various domestic high schools and universities. For example, this includes, the provision of methodological worksheets, which are complementary to audiovisual demonstrations of television programs. Regarding universities, Czech television organizes program \"ČT start\" which offers various workshops or even job opportunities for students who are in their final year. \n\nSince 1993 Czech television is a member of European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which is the largest professional association of national broadcasters in the world and brings together over 70 active members from more than fifty countries in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East and other associate members from around the world.\n\nČeská televize is funded through television concession fees which are paid by all households and legal entities that own a television or any form television signal receiver. Concession fees are currently set to 135 Kč per month (around €5) since 2008 and due to persistent positive inflation their real value is declining each year. On top of that, the total number of receivers has declined by 88 thousand from 2010 to 2020 and thus reduced annual income by 143 mil. Kč. Television fees are the main source of funding for Czech Television and are used primarily for production and broadcasting programs. They amount more than 90% of television income according to the budget estimate on Y2020. Additional income is earned through advertising where it is less successful than commercial television stations, because it is restricted by law and revenue from other business activities (product placement. selling rights to content, sponsoring etc.). During 2004 and 2005 the organisation lobbied the Czech government to increase the licence fee so that advertising could be eliminated, but even after multiple increasements advertising still remain on some channels with certain limitations.\n\nBecause of the decreasing amount of payers and real fee value Czech Television responds to this by making the most of the opportunities offered by legislation to identify both individuals and legal entities who are not paying the television fee. Czech legislation is allowing Czech Television to use databases of energy suppliers to identify all households which are consuming electricity and thus potentially could own a television. Persons or households detected by this system are taken as feepayer unless they make a claim that they are not by sending affidavit. In the event of revelation, the black listener is obliged to pay, in addition to the fees due, a surcharge of 10,000 for an unreported television. Addressing unregistered feepayers is associated with the cost of sending letters and higher the need for call center operators, but the television is able to collect through this method additional tens of millions.\n\nMedia occasionally raise questions about how much Česká televize is able to withstand pressure both from the governing parties and the opposition and maintain unbiased and critical coverage of politics. Most criticisms are from left-wing and nationalist parties and groups. In a long struggle with ČT is also president of Czech Republic, Miloš Zeman, who on the last occasion unofficially suggest to create possibility for citizens who disagree with ČT, can pay compulsory television licence fee for charitable and social programs. Because of perceived bias against Zeman and anti-leftist stances, some left-wing legislators (Jaroslav Foldyna and others) said they will vote against the annual report of ČT until all financial connections of ČT will be revealed. In 2013 was publicly revealed information about incomes and salaries of ČT official Karel Burian, director of Brno ČT who earned in the first half of 2011 nearly 2 million CZK (about 80,000 USD), which is much more than Czech Republic top politicians, including more than Prime Minister or President of Czech Republic.\n\nThe Act on Czech Television precisely sets the limits that Czech Television has in obtaining revenues from the sale of advertising. The law stipulates that: On ČT2 and ČT sport, advertising time may not exceed 0.5% of the daily broadcast time on each from these programs (ie max. 7 min and 12 sec per day), while the broadcast of advertisements may not in time from 7 pm to 10 pm exceed 6 minutes during one broadcast hour on each of these programs.\n\nOn the ČT1 and ČT24 programs, advertising may not be included in the broadcast at all, with the exception of advertising included in the broadcast of a program that is in direct connection with a cultural or sports broadcast events, if the broadcasting of such advertising is a necessary condition for the acquisition of television broadcasting rights cultural or sporting events. If an ad is included, the ad time is limited as well as on the ČT2 and ČT sport programs (ie for 7 min and 12 sec per day).\n\nAs with their acquisition, as well as the use of funds obtained from advertising, Czech Television is restricted by Act No. 302/2011 Coll.: On a quarterly basis, Czech Television transfers the revenue from advertising broadcast on the ČT2 program to the State Fund culture of the Czech Republic. Czech Television deducts the proven costs associated with the sale of advertising.from the revenue.\n\nRevenues from advertising broadcasting on the ČT sport program are used by Czech Television for production and broadcastingsports programs. Teleshopping is completely banned on Czech Television. These restrictions do not apply to product placement, which is used in own creation.\n\nThe current General Manager of Česká televize is Petr Dvořák, who was elected for a six-year term by the Czech Television Council (\"Rada České televize\") in September 2011 and re-elected in 2017. Dvorak has courted some controversy in his tenure given his previous membership in the communist party, similar to his predecessor Jiří Janeček However, in contrast to his predecessor, Dvořák had relatively little experience in public service broadcasting, with less than a decade of prior experience as the CEO of commercial TV station Nova, under the direction of major shareholder PPF Group, serving as his only media experience. Since departing from Nova and CME, PPF has acquired a controlling interest in the station from American conglomerate AT&T. \n\nCzech television is one of the major employers in the area of film and art in the Czech Republic with 3005 employees to date 31.12.2019. \n\nCzech Television Council is a supervisory authority of Czech Television. The ČT Council has fifteen members elected and removed by the Chamber of Deputies so that important regional, political, social and cultural currents of opinion are represented in it. The members of the Board are elected for a term of office of 6 years, with one-third of the members being elected every 2 years; they may be re-elected. Powers of the Czech Television Council are defined by law of Czech Television and the important powers are:\n\n\nThe Czech Television Council manages according to its own budget, the costs of the Council's activities and the remuneration of its members, as well as the costs of the Supervisory Board's activities and the remuneration of its members are paid from a special expenditure item in the Czech Television budget.\n\n"}

Two victims, , age 10, and , age 11, were murdered by a 14-year-old boy reportedly named Shinichiro Azuma, under the alias .\n\nThe perpetrator was arrested on June 28, 1997 in connection with the Hase murder, and later confessed to both murders. As a juvenile offender, he was prosecuted and convicted as \"Boy A\". His real name has not been released to the press because Japanese law prohibits publishing the identification, but in some weekly magazines his real name has been reported. Beginning in 2004, \"Boy A\" was released on a provisional basis, with a full release announced to follow on January 1, 2005. The murders and subsequent release of the perpetrator gained widespread attention from Japanese media and politicians.\n\nOn May 27, 1997, the head of , a special education pupil at Tainohata Elementary School, was found in front of the school gate hours before pupils arrived for classes. Hase had been beheaded with a handsaw, with further mutilations being done before being left in front of the school, for students to discover when they arrived in the morning. A note, written in red pen, was found stuffed in his mouth, identifying the killer as \"Sakakibara.\" The note read:\n\n\"\"This is the beginning of the game... Try to stop me if you can you stupid police... I desperately want to see people die, it is a thrill for me to commit murder. A bloody judgment is needed for my years of great bitterness.\"\" Additionally, some English was on the note as well: \"shooll killer\".\n\nPolice commented that the style of Hase's killing and the note was reminiscent of that of the Zodiac murders in the San Francisco area during the late 1960s.\n\nOn June 6, a letter was sent to the newspaper \"Kobe Shinbun\", in which Sakakibara claimed responsibility for the slaying and decapitation of Jun Hase, and threatened that more killings would follow. This second letter, delivered in a brown envelope postmarked June 3, had no return address or name. Enclosed was a three-page, 1400-word letter, also written in red ink, which included a six-character name that can be pronounced as \"Sakakibara Seito\". The same characters, which mean \"alcohol\", \"devil\", \"rose\", \"saint\" and \"fight\", were used in the first message that was inserted into the boy's mouth.\n\nBeginning with the phrase \"Now, it's the beginning of a game\", the letter stated that \"I am putting my life at stake for the sake of this game... If I'm caught, I'll probably be hanged... police should be angrier and more tenacious in pursuing me... It's only when I kill that I am liberated from the constant hatred that I suffer and that I am able to attain peace. It is only when I give pain to people that I can ease my own pain.\" The letter also lashed out against the Japanese educational system, calling it \"compulsory education that formed me, an invisible person.\"\n\nIn the initial panic, the Japanese media misreported the name as \"Onibara\" - Demon's Rose, though the killer insisted it was as he gave it. Infuriated by the mixup, Sakakibara later wrote to the station, \"From now on, if you misread my name or spoil my mood I will kill three vegetables a week... If you think I can only kill children you are greatly mistaken.\" (In this context, the \"vegetables\" that Sakakibara meant were humans with developmental disabilities).\n\nA 14-year-old junior high school student was arrested as a suspect in the Hase murder on June 28. Shortly after his arrest, \"Boy A\" also confessed to the murder of a 10-year-old girl, Ayaka Yamashita (山下彩花 \"Yamashita Ayaka\"), on March 16, as well as the assaults of three other girls on and around that same date. After the March 16 attack, he wrote in his diary: \"I carried out sacred experiments today to confirm how fragile human beings are... I brought the hammer down, when the girl turned to face me. I think I hit her a few times but I was too excited to remember.\" The following week, on March 23, he added: \"This morning my mom told me, 'Poor girl. The girl attacked seems to have died.' There is no sign of me being caught... I thank you, \"Bamoidōkishin\", for this... Please continue to protect me.\"\n\nAfter the murders, Japanese politician Shizuka Kamei called for restricting objectionable content, stating, \"Movies lacking any literary or educational merit made for just showing cruel scenes... Adults should be blamed for this\", and that \"[the incident] gives adults the chance to rethink the policy of self-imposed restrictions on these films and whether they should allow them just because they are profitable.\"\n\nIn 2000, Japan's bicameral legislature lowered the age for criminal responsibility from 16 to 14. However, in the wake of the June 1, 2004 murder of Satomi Mitarai by 11-year-old \"Girl A\" (Sasebo slashing), there has been some discussion for the need for further revision.\n\nOn March 11, 2004, in an unprecedented act, the Japanese Ministry of Justice announced that Sakakibara, 21 at the time, was being released on a provisional basis, with a full release to follow on January 1, 2005. Critics have charged that since the government had taken the unusual step of notifying the public, that Sakakibara was likely not fit for release and should be transferred to prison. In the wake of the Sasebo slashing, three months later, this criticism was exacerbated.\n\nDue to the seriousness of the crimes and the fact that they had been committed by a minor, his name and new residence to this day remain a highly-guarded secret. Yet, his real name has been circulated on the Internet since June 29, 1997, according to journalist Fumihiko Takayama.\n\nA number of people, including Shōjirō Gotō (a lawyer who dealt with many false accusation cases), Hidehiko Kumagai and Nobuyoshi Iwata (former principal of the junior high school that Boy A attended), insist that Boy A was wrongfully accused and point out contradictions in the statements of the investigating authorities, for example:\n\nIn 2002, the boy's mother visited him in prison and asked him if he had really committed the crimes. He affirmed this to her.\n\nIn June 2015, Sakakibara, then aged 32, released an autobiography through Ohta Publishing titled \"Zekka\" (絶歌), in which he claimed to express regret for his crimes and recounted the murders in graphic detail. Despite attempts by Jun Hase's family to block the release of \"Zekka\", and despite one bookstore chain refusing to stock the book, it quickly reached the top of Japanese bestseller lists. A few months later, Sakakibara set up a vanity website in which he posted bizarre photoshopped images of a nude male, suggested to be himself. In response to these controversies, the tabloid \"Shūkan Post\" publicized Sakakibara's real name to be Shinichiro Azuma, his occupation at the time, and his location.\n\n\n"}

Cowboy opened the office in 1949, and Eddie Graham bought into the promotion in 1961, then took over completely in 1971, because of health reasons with Cowboy.\n\nThe office was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance during the entire CWF era, Eddie Graham serving two terms as NWA president, and loosely aligned before that, with other 'world' champions sometimes defending their titles. CWF became a staple in many Southern households in the 1970s and 1980s, with Dusty Rhodes arguably its most noted headliner, his babyface turn beginning in 1973 against former partner Pak Song. The promotion competed against other syndicated shows on Saturday night like The Lawrence Welk Show and Solid Gold for years.\n\nThe promotion thrived with stars such as NWA champions Lou Thesz and Gene Kiniski, Graham, Don Curtis, Sam Steamboat, the Great Malenko (Larry Simon), Johnny Valentine, Hiro Matsuda, Bob Orton Sr. and later Jr., Joe Scarpa (later Chief Jay Strongbow), Wahoo McDaniel, the Funks (Terry and Dory, Jr.), the Briscos (Jack and Jerry), Buddy Colt (Ron Read), Dusty Rhodes, Barry Windham, Mike Rotunda, Mike Graham (Eddie's son), Kevin Sullivan – whose cult-like Army of Darkness got tremendous heat from the fans – and, in the words of the promotion's legendary commentator and a star in his own right Gordon Solie, 'a host of others'. Solie's deadpan interviewing style often buoyed the outlandish behavior and actions of Sullivan and his minions, bringing a legitimacy to the on-air segments no matter what depths Sullivan would descend to.\n\nDusty Rhodes stands out among the noted performers because of the number of rivalries he had on air through most of CWF's broadcasting history. Well known heels, newcomers and babyfaces who turned heel during their tenure with CWF often sought out Rhodes to make their names in the territory. His rivals over the years included Superstar Billy Graham, Ray Stevens, Ernie Ladd, Ivan Koloff, Ox Baker, Ron Bass, Kamala, Abdullah the Butcher, Ric Flair, his old Texas Outlaws partner Dick Murdoch and of course, Kevin Sullivan.\n\nWhen Eddie Graham committed suicide on Super Bowl Sunday in January 1985, due to a combination of personal and business reverses, responsibility for the office went to Hiro Matsuda and Duke Keomuka, both of whom bought in during the 1960s. The other remaining owners were Mike Graham, Eddie's brother Skip Gossett, Dusty Rhodes and Buddy Colt. The promotion continued losing money and merged with Jim Crockett Promotions in February 1987. Most of the stars had gone to Jim Crockett Promotions or the WWF by that point.\n\nCWF filmed and later taped its weekly TV wrestling show at the famed Sportatorium at 106 N. Albany in Tampa, Fla., which was in reality a small television studio with seating for a live audience of about 100 people (1/40th of the seating capacity of its Dallas counterpart), with the wrestling office and gym in the same building. Arena footage was always also used, and full arena show broadcasts began in the early '80s. CWF Spin-off shows were \"Championship Wrestling Superstars\", \"Global Wrestling\", \"North Florida Championship Wrestling\", \"United States Class Wrestling\", \"American Championship Wrestling\" and \"Southern Professional Wrestling\".\n\nOn March 2, 2006, it was announced that the CWF library was purchased by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) for the DVD on Dusty Rhodes.\n\nGordon Solie was featured at the end of WWE's FCW TV show, \"FCW TV\" in a tribute to CWF and himself.\nHoward Brody started NWA Florida in 1990 and he booked for it until 2002.\n\nIn 2003, Kevin Rhodes started Championship Wrestling from Florida as a member of the NWA. He occasionally has some legends of the 1980s wrestling appear in his promotion.\n\nIn 2007, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) revived the promotion as a developmental territory under the name Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). In 2012, the promotion began operating under the NXT Wrestling banner, dropping references to FCW.\n\nOn June 28, 2013, the WWE formally shuttered the Florida Championship Wrestling Arena, moving all equipment and personnel to the WWE Performance Facility in Orlando.\n\n\n\n"}

He attended Edge End High School, where he was inspired by drama teacher Brian Wellock. His father, Ronald, a Mancunian, was a musician; and from the age of twelve, John sang and played guitar with his father on stage in the working men's clubs.\n\nIn 1986, Simm enrolled at Blackpool and the Fylde College in Lytham St. Annes for three years, and starred in \"Guys and Dolls\" and \"West Side Story\" at Blackpool's Grand Theatre. However, he soon decided that musical theatre did not interest him, so he joined an amateur dramatic group and honed his skills in his spare time, playing the title roles in \"Billy Liar\" and \"Amadeus\". He then moved to London to train at the Drama Centre London at the age of 19, where he studied Stanislavski's system of method acting. His acting teacher was Reuven Adiv, whom Simm credits as a major influence on his life. He graduated in 1992.\n\nIndependently of his acting, throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Simm was a founding member, songwriter, and guitarist with the rock band Magic Alex (named after the Beatles self-styled electronics wizard \"Magic Alex\" Mardas).

Upon the creation of a new Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) in 1987, those newly hired after that date cannot participate in CSRS. CSRS continues to provide retirement benefits to those eligible to receive them.\n\nCSRS is a defined-benefit plan, akin to a pension. Notably, though, CSRS employees do not participate in Social Security (unless having worked in the private sector beforehand, and then subject to penalties).\n\nEmployees hired after 1983 are required to be covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), which is a three tiered retirement system with a smaller defined benefit (pension), Social Security, and a 401(k)-style system called the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). The defined benefits of both the CSRS and the FERS systems are paid out of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, which had a projected balance of $898 billion as of September 30, 2017.\n\nWith changes in the determining retirement coverage of federal employees under FERS or CSRS, those employees who are later rehired that were previously covered under CSRS will retain their CSRS coverage if they meet certain service rules. In general, if rehired employees have 5 years of civilian service as of December 31, 1986, they will retain CSRS coverage. However, if the break in service is greater than 365 days, the employee is also covered under Social Security and will be deemed CSRS Offset. Overall benefits paid to CSRS or CSRS Offset employees will remain equitable based on the number of years of creditable service and CSRS formula upon retirement. CSRS and CSRS Offset employees with a break in service more than three days are also eligible to elect coverage under FERS within the first six months of rehire.\n\nEmployees who were previously covered under CSRS and do not meet the 5 year retirement coverage rule are automatically covered under the FERS upon rehire.\n\nEmployees under CSRS (and CSRS Offset) may contribute to TSP as well, but participate as a supplement to their designated pension benefit. Contributions to the TSP are not matched.\n"}

Seven years later, he started racing in the Winston Cup Series, making his series debut with Donlavey Racing. Barrett has since run part-time across NASCAR's top three series, usually as an owner/driver. Barrett has also competed in the IndyCar Series, running four races in 2009 for Team 3G.\n\nBarrett first started racing when he was 16 in karts, winning 21 races in 28 starts. In 1992, Barrett started racing in NASCAR's Busch North Series, his debut coming at the Big Apple Food Stores 200 at Oxford Plains Speedway at the age of 19; Barrett finished 21st, eleven laps behind race winner Joe Bessey.

{"id": "1910237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910237", "title": "B.O.T.A. tarot deck", "text": "B.O.T.A. tarot deck\n\nThe B.O.T.A. Tarot was created by Paul Foster Case, founder of B.O.T.A. and artist Jessie Burns Parke. Although it is based upon, and for the most part closely resembles, Arthur Edward Waite's 1910 Rider-Waite deck, Case changed what he said were mistakes or \"blinds\" on part of Waite. The B.O.T.A. Tarot is presented in several editions: the standard-sized full deck and a larger version containing only the Major Arcana (trump cards; often called 'tarot keys' by Case) are black and white, since Case believed that every student needed to color their own deck. After his death, the Major Arcana became also available in color. Each of these cards has a border of a particular color, which is the color that is associated with the card in the writings of Case.\n\nEvery trump card has a Hebrew letter written on it in the lower right corner, which is the letter that is associated with the card in the writings of Case. In contrast to some earlier occult tarot decks, which place the fool card last in order, and associate it with the second-to-last Hebrew letter, shin (such decks order the last Hebrew letter, tav, before shin), the B.O.T.A. deck places the fool card first in order, and therefore associates it with the first Hebrew letter, aleph. It also orders shin before tav, in the correct order of Hebrew letters.\n\nAll of the illustrations on the cards of the BOTA deck differ in at least some minor way from those of the Rider-Waite deck, but some cards contrast much more than others.\n\nThe card that contrasts the most between the two decks is the death card. In the Rider-Waite deck, the death card depicts death as an armored knight on a horse, carrying a banner, whereas in the BOTA deck, the death card depicts death as a bare skeleton with a scythe, with a red sky in the background, being based upon the death card of the Marseille tarot deck.\n\nIn the Rider-Waite deck, the sun card depicts a nude child on a horse, carrying a dull-red banner, whereas in the BOTA deck, the sun card depicts two nude children standing in a field, being based upon the sun card of the Marseille tarot deck.\n\nIn his book \"The Tarot\", Case published the Hebrew letter attributions of the Golden Dawn for the first time. Also made public was the tarot tableau, a pattern for laying out all of the tarot cards which reveals certain relationships and dissimilarities among them. This tableau was used by the American branch of Alpha et Omega when Case was the 'praemonstrator' (chief instructor) of that order's Thoth-Hermes lodge in Chicago. The tarot tableau is an arrangement of the 22 major arcana cards into 4 horizontal rows that span across 7 vertical columns. On the top row there is only the fool card, in the center of the row. Rows two through four consist of 7 cards each, arranged in sequential order, such that cards 1 through 7 are on row two, cards 8 through 14 are on row three, and cards 15 through 21 are on row four.\n\nB.O.T.A. repeatedly emphasizes that tarot cards are primarily a tool for meditation, not fortune-telling. P.F. Case invented a new, non-magical definition for the word 'divination', his new definition being \"the use of spiritual intuition to find solutions to problems\". After explaining the B.O.T.A. method for tarot divination in his book titled 'The Tarot, A Key to the Wisdom of the Ages', Case specifically explains the differences between this particular type of divination and fortune-telling. Case then closes with the warning: \"Finally, let me reiterate the thought that this is not to be used for vulgar fortune telling, or to amuse a party of friends. If you yield to the temptation so to abuse this information, you will pay for it in the loss of all power of true divination, and probably in the loss of ability to control the higher rates of psychic vibration.\"\n\n\"The Tarot\" was the first published book to reveal almost all of the tarot attributions on the 'Cube of Space' diagram. There are 22 major arcana tarot cards, which correspond to 22 components of the Cube of Space.\n\nThe Sepher Yetzirah is the source of the link between the Cube of Space and the Hebrew letters. The Sepher Yetzirah itself does not directly mention a 'cube of space', nor any kind of cube. Case based the Cube of Space upon two verses in the Sepher Yetzirah. One of those verses is in chapter 4 and the other verse is in chapter 5. The verse in chapter 4 associates 6 Hebrew letters with six cardinal directions (up, down, east, west, north, south). The verse in chapter 5 associates 12 Hebrew letters with either 12 diagonal directional 'arms' or 12 diagonal boundaries (different translations contradict each other), which would refer to the 12 edges of an octahedron, though Paul Foster Case interpreted these as the 12 edges of a cube.\n\nP.F. Case furthermore associated this 'Cube of Space' with the 'Tree of Life' of Kabbala. He based that association upon paragraph 95 of the Sepher Ha-Bahir. That paragraph does not actually mention the Tree of Life though, but simply a tree. Paragraph 95 states that a tree is inside the twelve diagonal boundary lines that are mentioned in the Sepher Yetzirah. Because the Tree of Life consists of 10 sephiroth, P.F. Case associated the three 'mother' letters (aleph, mem, shin) and seven 'double' letters of the Sepher Yetzirah with ten corresponding sephiroth.\n\nUntil the publication of \"The Tarot\", most English-speaking occultists had never heard of Case's Cube of Space concept, much less were they aware of how it related to the much better-known 'Tree of Life' diagram. In fact, until the mid-1990s, there were almost no other books in print which even mentioned the Cube of Space. The ones that do defer to Case's writings on the subject.\n\n\n\"Writings of Case and others regarding the B.O.T.A. Tarot deck\"\n\n\"Online resources discussing or using the B.O.T.A.

United States, 506 U.S. 224 (1993), was a United States Supreme Court decision that determined that the question of whether the Senate had properly tried an impeachment was a political question and could not be resolved in the courts.\n\nThe Chief Judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, Walter Nixon, was convicted of committing perjury before a grand jury but refused to resign from office even after he had been incarcerated. Nixon was subsequently impeached by the US House of Representatives, and the matter was referred to the Senate for a vote on Nixon's removal. The Senate appointed a committee to hear the evidence against Nixon and later report to the body as a whole. The Senate then heard the report of the committee and voted to remove Nixon from office. Nixon contended that this did not meet the constitutional requirement of Article I for the case to be \"tried by the Senate.\"\n\nThe court's decision was unanimous, but four separate opinions were published. The majority opinion, by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, held that the courts may not review the impeachment and trial of a federal officer because the Constitution reserves that function to a coordinate political branch. of the Constitution gives the Senate the \"sole power to try all impeachments.\" Because of the word \"sole\" it is clear that the judicial branch was not to be included. Furthermore, because the word \"try\" was originally understood to include factfinding committees, there was a textually demonstrable commitment to give broad discretion to the Senate in impeachments.\n\nFurthermore the Framers believed that representatives of the people should try impeachments, and the Court was too small to justly try impeachments. Also, the judicial branch is \"checked\" by impeachments, so judicial involvement in impeachments might violate the doctrine of the separation of powers.\n\nThe Court further ruled that involving the judiciary would prevent finality without clear remedy and bias post-impeachment criminal or civil prosecutions, which the Constitution explicitly allows.\n\nJustices Byron White, Harry Blackmun, and David Souter concurred, but voiced concern that the Court was foreclosing the area for review. While they found that the Senate had done all that was constitutionally required, they were concerned that the Court should have the power to review cases in which the Senate removed an impeached officer summarily without a hearing, or through some arbitrary process such as \"a coin toss.\"\n\nAn important feature of this case is how it diverges from \"Powell v. McCormack\" (1969). In \"Powell,\" a grant of discretionary power to Congress was deemed to be justiciable because it required a mere \"interpretation\" of the Constitution.\n\n"}

It was entered into the 21st Berlin International Film Festival. The film takes place in the sixteenth century and details the alleged cannibalistic practices of the (now extinct) indigenous Tupinamba warrior tribe against the French and Portuguese colonizers of the Brazilian littoral. The film is something of a black comedy about European colonialism—one that makes satirical use of the Brazilian modernist trope of \"Antropofagia\" (\"cultural cannibalism\"), then recently revived by the Tropicalismo movement of the 1960s—as well as a bitter commentary on the historical genocide of the indigenous tribes in Latin America and the gradual destruction of their civilization.\n\nHis 1994 film \"The Third Bank of the River\" was entered into the 44th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nPereira dos Santos' 2006 film \"Brasília 18%\" explores some of the darker aspects of contemporary Brazilian politics such as political corruption, the murder of trial witnesses, and money laundering.\n\nPereira dos Santos was a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters since 2006.\n\nPereira dos Santos died of multiple organ failure in Rio de Janeiro on 12 April 2018.

{"id": "1910246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910246", "title": "Federal Employees Retirement System", "text": "Federal Employees Retirement System\n\nThe Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) is the retirement system for employees within the United States civil service. FERS became effective January 1, 1987, to replace the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and to conform federal retirement plans in line with those in the private sector.\n\nFERS consists of three major components:\n\nSince January 1, 1984, employees with fewer than 5 years of non-military experience on December 31, 1986, were covered under interim retirement rules under which they were covered by both CSRS and the Social Security system. They made reduced payments to the CSRS (1.3 percent of earnings instead of the usual 7 percent) and contributed their full employee share to Social Security. Employees with more than 5 years of non-military service on December 31, 1986, continued under the dual benefit coverage unless they opted to switch to FERS between July 1, 1986, and December 31, 1987. Employees covered only by CSRS remained covered by it unless they opted to switch to FERS. Once an employee elected to switch to FERS the choice was irrevocable.\n\nMost new federal employees hired on or after January 1, 1987, are automatically covered under FERS. Those newly hired and certain employees rehired between January 1, 1984, and December 31, 1986, were automatically converted to coverage under FERS on January 1, 1987; the portion of time under the old system is referred to as \"CSRS Offset\" and only that portion falls under the CSRS rules. Rehired federal employees who worked prior to December 31, 1983, and had 5 years of civilian service by December 31, 1986, can choose between remaining in CSRS or electing FERS within six months of rehire, but should the employee elect to switch from CSRS to FERS coverage, the election is irrevocable. Employees of Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities of the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security participate in a separate retirement system, except when retaining previous coverage under a different retirement system following a transfer.\n\nEmployees hired prior to January 1, 2013 contribute 0.8 percent of salaries to their FERS annuity (post-tax, unlike TSP contributions which are pre-tax) to their annuity, while employees hired in 2013 contribute 3.1 percent and employees hired in 2014 and thereafter contribute 4.4 percent (an additional 0.5 percent applies to certain special category positions, regardless of when hired); this percentage does not change so long as the employee remains in Federal service. The government matching portion is dependent on the employee's job classification and is based on actuarial assumptions, and is subject to change.\n\nUnlike TSP, where an employee can choose not to participate and thus not have any withdrawals from salary, FERS contributions are mandatory. However, at retirement or separation from Federal service, one may ask for a refund of contributions made; only employee contributions (this includes deposits and redeposit for creditable military service and civilian service where no FERS annuity contributions were made) are refunded (with interest; the interest portion is taxable income unless rolled over into an IRA), government matching contributions are not refunded and are lost. However, a spouse or former spouse must be notified, and a refund will not be allowed if it would end a court-ordered right for a spouse or former spouse to obtain benefits from the employee's Federal service. And if the employee returns to Federal service, a refund voids entitlement to an annuity based on the former service unless repaid upon return.\n\nIn order to qualify for the standard FERS annuity an employee must have reached a minimum retirement age (MRA) and have a specified number of years of \"creditable Federal service\". Credit for certain levels of military service (as well as some part-time employment prior to 1989) may be repurchased for a specified percentage of prior salary plus accrued interest; such repurchase is optional and can be made at any time prior to retirement (but not after retirement). Part-time work is counted on a pro-rated basis (e.g. a person working one year, part-time for 40 hours of a regular 80-hour pay period, is credited with half a year of service). Any leave without pay days (e.g. days when an employee was furloughed and not later repaid, or who was on unpaid leave due to a serious medical condition) are counted as if having worked, limited to six months in a year.\n\nThe MRA is based on the employee's birth year as shown on the table below:\nFor an immediate retirement (which starts the first day of the first full month after the employee separates from service) or a deferred retirement (which starts on a date of the employee's choosing) the employee must meet one of the following combinations of age and years of actual creditable service:\n\nEmployees facing either involuntary separation (for reasons other than misconduct or poor performance), or voluntary separation in lieu of a \"reduction in force\" can, in some cases, qualify for early retirement. The employee must either be age 50 with 20 years of actual creditable service, or have 25 years of actual creditable service at any age (the MRA does not apply in this case).\n\nDisability retirement is also a potential option for eligible federal employees with at least 18 months of service who no longer can perform their duties. The following conditions are required:\n\nThe FERS annuity is based on a specified percentage (either 1% or 1.1%, see below), multiplied by (a) the length of an employee's Federal service eligible for FERS retirement (referred to as \"creditable Federal service\", which may not be the actual duration of Federal employment) and (b) the average annual rate of basic pay of the employee's highest-paid consecutive 36 months (three years) of service (commonly referred to as the \"high-3\" period).\n\nThe \"high-3\" pay includes all items for which retirement deductions are withheld; this includes basic pay, locality pay adjustments and shift differentials, but not overtime (except in special circumstances mainly involving first responders), bonuses/awards, severance pay or buyouts, payments for unused annual leave and credit hours, or \"hazard pay\" (additional pay for certain \"hazardous\" duty assignments, such as working in a combat zone). All salaries earned during the \"high-3\" period are time-weighted, and include COLA's, within-grade (step) increases, and promotions. The \"high-3\" period normally is the final three years of service but does not have to be (e.g. an employee taking a voluntary downgrade to avoid a reduction-in-force (RIF)—a layoff in private-sector terms—could have a high-3 period in an earlier time frame). \n\nThe FERS annuity is structured to provide employees an incentive to continue working for at least 20 years in Federal service and until age 62 (which is also the earliest age at which a FERS employee can collect Social Security benefits), since employees retiring at or after age 62 with 20 years of service or more have the annuity calculated at 1.1 percent of the high-3 average times the number of years worked (including fractional years using months but not days), while employees not meeting those criteria have the annuity calculated at 1 percent of such. Separate calculations exist for certain workers (mainly Members of Congress or congressional staff, law enforcement officers, firefighters and air traffic control specialists) and for employees who transferred from CSRS to FERS. An employee retiring under age 62 will receive a \"special retirement supplement\" which duplicates what an employee would earn under Social Security at age 62, but at age 62 the supplement ends. Disability retirement annuity payments are offset totally by any Social Security disability payments for the first 12 months, and then partially afterwards until age 62; at that time the annuity is treated as if the employee had worked for the entire period of disability (but at the same grade and step, with no within-grade increases or career ladder promotions taken into account), and the \"high-3\" and resulting annuity is recalculated taking into account any COLA's that would have been earned between the original retirement and age 62.\n\nUnused sick leave is converted, at 100% of the balance for employees retiring in 2015 and after, to additional creditable service based on a conversion table, where 2,087 hours equals one full year of additional creditable service. The leave can only increase the amount of creditable service for annuity purposes; it cannot be used to create an eligibility which did not exist (e.g. to either make an otherwise ineligible person eligible for retirement).\n\nThe actual calculation of creditable service adds years, months, and days separately for civilian employment, military employment repurchased, and unused sick leave.\n\nNo other types of earned leave are factored into the annuity calculation. Unused annual leave hours are \"cashed out\" (paid to the employee, at his/her rate of pay as if the employee remained on the payroll until the leave was fully used; in the event of an intervening COLA leave remaining after its effective date will be paid at the new rate). Where applicable, earned but unused credit hours are also cashed out upon retirement at the same rate as annual leave. Other types of unused leave (such as compensatory time off for travel outside normal duty hours, and time off awards given in lieu of cash) are not paid and are thus lost if not used before retirement.\n\nGenerally, an employee has the right to determine his/her \"date of final separation\" (i.e. the last day on the payroll; it does not have to be the final working day in a pay period); the following day is the employee's retirement date. The annuity does not begin until one full calendar month has passed since the employee's retirement. Thus, an employee retiring on June 30 will have his/her annuity begin on August 1 (as the employee will be retired beginning July 1 and for the entire month of July), but an employee retiring on July 1 will not have his/her annuity begin until September 1 (as the employee will be retired beginning July 2 but not for the entire month of July, only in the following month—August—will the employee be retired for an entire month).\n\nMarried employees will have their annuity reduced by a survivor benefit unless the spouse specifically in writing consents to receiving less than a full benefit; the reduction is based on the survivor benefit chosen.\n\nEmployees are eligible for a COLA if they meet certain criteria. The most notable is retirement after age 62; most employees who retire before age 62 will not receive a COLA (on either their annuity or their special retirement supplement) until age 62 (however, certain categories of employees, mainly those who are required to retire early based on their occupation or who retire on disability, will receive a COLA before age 62).\n\nBecause employee contributions are post-tax, a portion of any FERS annuity received is not taxable. However, the non-tax portion is relatively small (since the majority of the annuity contributions are paid by the government); and even though the non-tax portion would be paid back within a few months after retirement, tax law requires it to be spread out over a period of years depending on the annuitant's (and his/her spouse's) age (but in the event the annuitant dies before it is repaid, the unpaid balance is paid as shown below).\n\nIf an employee/retiree dies and a survivor benefit was not chosen, then any unpaid balance of employee contributions (but not government matching contributions) is paid to the beneficiary(ies) designated.\n\nIf the employee/retiree did not designate any beneficiary(ies), then the \"statutory order of precedence\" is used, as follows:\n\nThe Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act (FERCCA) legislation was signed in September 2000. It was designed to provide relief to federal civilian employees who were placed in the wrong retirement system for at least three years of service after December 31, 1986.\n\nFERCCA gave affected employees and annuitants placed in the wrong retirement system an opportunity to choose between the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) and the offset provisions of CSRS. FERCCA may also provide one or more of the following:\n\n"}

In 1980 the Cotton Belt began operating the Rock Island's Golden State Route which added the states of Kansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico to the operation. Operation of the Cotton Belt was assumed by parent Southern Pacific Transportation Company in 1992.\n\nThe Cotton Belt was part of the railroad empire acquired by financier Jay Gould in the last quarter of the 19th century. \"By 1890 Gould owned the Missouri Pacific, the Texas and Pacific, the St. Louis Southwestern, and the International-Great Northern, one-half of the mileage in the Southwest\", the \"Handbook of Texas\" wrote.\n\nThe railroad was organized on January 15, 1891, although it had its origins in a series of short lines founded in Tyler, Texas, in 1870 that connected northeastern Texas to Arkansas and southeastern Missouri. Construction of the original Tyler Tap Railroad began in the summer of 1875.\n\nOn October 18, 1903, the Cotton Belt gained trackage rights over the Missouri Pacific Railroad along the eastern shore of the Mississippi River to reach East St. Louis, Illinois, and then used Terminal Railroad Association trackage rights into St. Louis. The Cotton Belt operated a freight station in downtown St. Louis, but its main base of operations in the area was its yard and a locomotive servicing facility in East St. Louis, just east of Valley Junction, and south of Alton and Southern Railroad's Gateway Yard, and north of Kansas City Southern's East St. Louis Yard. Union Pacific Railroad now operates Cotton Belt Yard, although the engine servicing facilities have been demolished. \nThe Cotton Belt and its subsidiary St. Louis Southwestern Railway of Texas operated 1,607 miles of road in 1945; 1,555 miles in 1965; and 2,115 miles in 1981 after taking over the Rock Island's Golden State Route. In 1925, SSW and SSW of Texas reported a total of 1,474 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 75 million passenger-miles; in 1970 it carried 8,650 million ton-miles and no passengers.\n\nThe Southern Pacific Company (SP) gained Interstate Commerce Commission approval to control the Cotton Belt system on April 14, 1932, but continued to operate it as a separate company until 1992, when the Southern Pacific consolidated the Cotton Belt's operations into the parent company. Cotton Belt diesel locomotives from 1959 on were painted in Southern Pacific's \"bloody nose\" scheme: a dark gray locomotive body with a red \"winged\" nose. \"Cotton Belt\" was painted on the sides and in later years the letters \"SSW\" were painted on the nose.\nMany former SSW locomotives are used by Union Pacific today, although few still sport unmodified \"Cotton Belt\" paint. Most of the remaining units have been repainted with the UP livery, while others wear \"patched\" SSW paint with a UP shield logo and new numbers applied over the SSW number. \n\nThe Cotton Belt ran passenger trains from St. Louis to Texas and from Memphis to Dallas and Shreveport, Louisiana. Cotton Belt's \"Lone Star\" operated from Memphis Union Station to Dallas Union Terminal with a connecting section from Lewisville, Arkansas, to Shreveport. The \"Morning Star\" was the second named train over much of this route, operating out of St. Louis Union Station to Dallas, with a separate Memphis section inaugurated in 1941 to provide a convenient connection with the Southern Railway's \"Tennessean\" to and from Washington, D.C. and New York City. The Cotton Belt also operated passenger trains between Mt. Pleasant, Tyler and Waco, and a doodlebug between Tyler and Lufkin.\n\nThe Cotton Belt began a series of passenger train cutbacks in the early 1950s. The railroad had 25 steam engines and four gas-electric motor cars available for passenger service in 1949. By late 1952 nine diesels had replaced the steam locomotives and motorcars and passenger train mileage had been trimmed considerably. The Cotton Belt was one of the first Class 1 lines in the southwest to discontinue passenger service. The last Cotton Belt passenger train, #8, operated on November 30, 1959, from Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to East St. Louis, Illinois.\n\n\nSt. Louis Southwestern 819 is maintained at the Arkansas Railroad Museum in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, by the Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society. The No. 819 is a L1 class 4-8-4 \"Northern\" and was the last new steam locomotive rostered by the Cotton Belt, being home built at the Pine Bluff Shops in 1943. After its retirement, it spent several decades on display in Oakland Park in Pine Bluff, until members of the Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society moved the locomotive back to the Pine Bluff Shops, where they began a three-year restoration appropriately called \"Project 819\". The 819 eventually returned to the rails for a second time in April 1986 and operated annually to various points on the railroad (trips to Fordyce, Little Rock, St. Louis, Tyler and Athens) until making its final run between Tyler, Texas and Pine Bluff on October 17, 1993. Today the 819 is on exhibit at Arkansas Railroad Museum housed inside the Pine Bluff Shops. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A hospital had been previously built at Hakodate for Russians and Japanese. The Rev. Nikolai Kasatkin (later St Nicholas of Japan), was attached to it as chaplain with a church near the hospital. The hospital was destroyed by fire, though the church remained, and Nicholas stayed as a missionary at Hakodate, where he baptized a number of Japanese. In 1870 the Russian minister to Japan obtained a grant of a special territory as a branch of the Russian legation at Surugadai at the very center of Tokyo. Here Father Nicholas established his residence and the center of the Orthodox Church. He began by training well-instructed men and native assistants, for which purpose he had an ordinary college and a school of philosophy and theology; later on he also had a special school for young women. He preached his religion by means of carefully trained catechists and priests. From 1881 he also had a religious review, published twice monthly, and a publication committee installed at his house published many books. In 1886 Fr Nicholas was consecrated bishop in Russia, and in 1890 he completed the erection of his cathedral.\n\nBishop Nicholas enjoyed a great personal esteem; he founded and governed everything pertaining to his mission. During the Russo-Japanese War the situation was very delicate, but the Christians, at least the greater number of them, did not abandon him. Even during this time he continued all his undertakings unmolested, his house being guarded by Japanese soldiers. Prior to that, he received from the Holy Synod 95,000 yen yearly, but during the Russo-Japanese War, these and other resources from Russia were greatly diminished, while on the other hand the price of everything in Japan increased. The bishop was compelled to diminish his expenses, to dismiss part of his staff, and to exhort the Christians to contribute more generously to support their church.\n\nAfter the victories of the Japanese over the Russian armies, the Christians leaders, after having agreed among themselves, declared to Archbishop Nicholas their intention to support themselves, independent of Russia. As Russia has its national church they wished to have also their Japanese National Church. \n\nLittle has been written concerning the work of the Russians in Japan; even in Russia almost nothing has been published. According to one Protestant reckoning, the Orthodox church numbered 30,166 baptized Christians; according to another only 13,000 (the last figure denotes perhaps practicing members). There were 37 native priests and 139 catechists. Expenses for church and evangelization in 1907 amounted to 55,279 yen; contributions of Christians, 10,711 yen; Churches or places of preaching, 265. Among the Russians, as among Protestants, and everywhere throughout Japan, the tendency was toward independence.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War, about 2,000,000 Russian refugees who did not accept the Bolshevik rule entered mostly the United States and Europe. Some of them settled in the Home Islands of Japan. Traditionally these refugees have been known as White Russians, with the corresponding Japanese term being \"Hakkei-Roshiajin\", a term which has been applied to all former residents of the former Russian Empire.\n\nInitially the majority of Russians lived in Tokyo and Yokohama. After the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923 a significant number of them moved to Kobe.\n\nA white émigré family is depicted in the novel The Makioka Sisters by famed Japanese author Junichiro Tanizaki.\n\nAs of 2005, the statistics of Japanese government reported 37,000 Russians enter Japan yearly on average, not counting temporary landing permits of seamen and tourists. The number of Russians that stay in Japan longer than 90 days (the maximal duration of a temporary visa in Japan) is about 6,000.\n\nThe Russian Embassy School in Tokyo serves Russian diplomat families in Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lake Hodges Bridge is an important part of San Diego's north-south transportation axis.\n\nThe original bridge was constructed in 1919. The bridge later became integrated into the newly constructed U.S. Route 395. As part of a roadway realignment and improvement project, the original structure was demolished in 1968, and replaced with a new structure in 1969. That bridge was subsequently replaced in 1981, when I-15 was built to supersede US 395.\n\nAs a traffic bottleneck, the bridge is vulnerable to traffic jams in North San Diego County. The nature of the lake and the surrounding land makes the bridge the singular access into the city of San Diego from inland North County. The only two major ways around the bridge are the Del Dios Highway, a two-lane winding road to Interstate 5 via Del Mar, and the trip through Ramona into Escondido. Although paved access roads through the San Pasqual Valley to the east of Lake Hodges do exist, they are lightly traveled and are not designed to handle heavy traffic. The bridge is thus effectively the only crossing point for drivers on the route.\n\nThe current bridge is a concrete viaduct. It was widened and replaced in 2006-2009 as part of a project to add managed lanes in the I-15 corridor.\n\nDepending on the amount of rainfall in San Diego County, Lake Hodges's water level fluctuates significantly. As such, Lake Hodges Bridge may cross over water or a dry lake bed from time to time. Due to the vast amount of vegetation that springs up when water levels are low, the area below the bridge has been jokingly referred to as \"Hodges National Forest\".\n\nThe Lake Hodges Pedestrian Bridge, officially named the David Kreitzer Lake Hodges Bicycle Pedestrian Bridge after a retired planning commissioner, is a pedestrian bridge spanning Lake Hodges immediately south of the Interstate 15 span. The bridge was opened to the public on May 15, 2009.\n\nThe bridge is of a stress-ribbon design, the longest of its type in the world, and only the sixth to have been built in the US.

In the 1980s, Ron and Don relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in order to become professional wrestlers. Ron worked as a police officer in West Palm Beach, Florida prior to moving to Tennessee with his brother.\n\nDon and Ron Harris, with support from the country music group Sawyer Brown, debuted in the Continental Wrestling Association in December 1987 as The Bruise Brothers, where they became two-time World Tag Team Champions. When the CWA became the United States Wrestling Association in 1989, the Bruise Brothers remained in the promotion. Don and Ron won five more Tag Team Championships, with Don winning two additional USWA World Tag Team Championships with Brian Lee and Ron winning an additional USWA World Tag Team Championship with Jimmy Harris (no relation) as \"Beauty and The Beast\". The Harris Brothers made a final appearance with the USWA in 1996 as \"The Grimm Brothers\". In 1991, the Bruise Brothers debuted in the Oregon-based National Wrestling Alliance Pacific Northwest promotion, where they became six-time Tag Team Champions. Don Harris was also part of the last match in that promotion's television show, defeating Jon Rambo. On January 27, 1992 the Harris Twins received a tryout match with the WWF at a Wrestling Challenge taping in Lubbock, TX defeating Khris Germany & Todd Overbow. They defeated the duo the following night in Amarillo, TX. In 1993, the Harris Brothers joined Smoky Mountain Wrestling as the Bruise Brothers, managed by Jim Cornette. On June 28, Cornette led them to a victory over the Rock 'n' Roll Express, Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson, for the SMW Tag Team Championships. The Bruise Brothers remained in SMW until early 1994, participating in hardcore matches such as Street Fights and steel cage matches.\n\nThe Bruise Brothers appeared in ECW in 1994. On February 5, the ECW Tag Team Championships were held-up after a controversial ending to a match between the Bruise Brothers and the incumbents, The Public Enemy. The Bruise Brothers went on to participate in some of the first ECW hardcore matches, and feuded with Shane Douglas.\n\nThe Harris Brothers were signed by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1995, where they were renamed \"The Blu Brothers\", Eli (Ron) and Jacob (Don). They retained their trademark bushy beards and long hair and were managed by Uncle Zebekiah. They made their WWF debuts at the 1995 Royal Rumble and were defeated by Lex Luger and The British Bulldog in the opening match of WrestleMania XI. Following a series of losses to the Smoking Gunns, the Harris Brothers left the WWF in October 1995.\n\nThey eventually left the WWF and returned to ECW in 1996 as the Bruise Brothers, competing once more in the tag division, and briefly joining Raven's Nest.\n\nDon and Ron Harris returned to the WWF in 1996, as the short-lived \"Grimm Twins,\" Jason (Ron) and Jarrod (Don). In June 1997, were repackaged as \"8-Ball\" (Ron) and \"Skull\" (Don), members of the Disciples of Apocalypse stable with Crush and their cousin, Chainz. The DOA participated in the \"gang wars\" of 1997, feuding with the Nation of Domination and the Puerto Rican stable Los Boricuas. They went on to compete in the tag division throughout 1998. Ron Harris also competed in the WWE's Brawl For All tournament on July 20, 1998, but lost to 2 Cold Scorpio in the third round. Their last match in WWF as a tag team was a defeat to Ken Shamrock and Mankind on May 14, 1999. Skull's last match was in a singles match against Ken Shamrock on May 15, 1999, in which he was defeated and 8-Ball's last match was in a singles match against Ken Shamrock on May 16, 1999, in which he was defeated. The brothers were released soon after.\n\nIn 1999, the Harris Brothers returned to World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as \"Gerald\" (Ron) and \"Patrick\" (Don). The names were shots at Pat Patterson and Gerald Brisco who worked for WWF as Vince McMahon's stooges. They were known collectively as \"Creative Control\". They went on to join the nWo 2000 in 2000 using their real names, acting as enforcers for Jeff Jarrett. They remained in WCW throughout 2000, feuding with Sid Vicious, Terry Funk and many of the younger tag teams, such as The Mamalukes. After winning the WCW World Tag Team Championship three times, the Harris Brothers began wrestling in singles matches in 2001, but WCW was purchased by the WWF in March 2001, and they were not hired.\n\nIn November and December 2001, Don and Ron Harris took part in the All Japan Pro Wrestling World's Strongest Tag Determination League 2001, an eight-team tag tournament. They defeated The Varsity Club (Mike Rotunda and Steve Williams) before losing to Mitsuya Nagai and Toshiaki Kawada in the tournament semi-finals.\n\nIn June 2002, the Harris Brothers were hired by the upstart Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion, joined Vince Russo's Sports Entertainment Xtreme faction in December 2002, and remained with the stable until it disbanded in mid-2003.\n\nOn July 19, 2003, Ron Harris appeared in Harley Race's World League Wrestling promotion, and, in a match refereed by Ricky Steamboat, won the WLW Heavyweight Championship by defeating Ron Powers (he was substituting for Trevor Rhodes, who had been injured earlier that evening). He lost the title on September 12, 2003 to Takeshi Morishima in a Tokyo title defence in the Nippon Budokan promoted by the Pro Wrestling Noah promotion.\n\nIn late 2003, Ron Harris began working for wrestler and burgeoning rap artist Randy Savage as a tour manager. The Harris Brothers were reunited in November 2004 when Savage debuted in TNA and, following a backstage altercation with his rival Hulk Hogan, requested that he be accompanied by two bodyguards at all times. The job was given to Ron Harris and Savage's tour bodyguard, Brian Adams. Savage had his final match in the promotion in a 6 man tag team match with Jeff Hardy and AJ Styles in a victory over Jeff Jarrett, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall on December 5, 2004, then immediately left the company afterwards, but the Harris Brothers were retained to act as road agents. In March 2005, the Harris Brothers reappeared onscreen as \"The Disciples of Destruction\", two bikers as a nod to their previous WWF gimmick. They were managed by Traci Brooks and had three different victories, one over the team of Buck Quartermain and Lex Lovett, one over Trinity's team Phi Delta Slam and one over the team of Cassidy Riley and Shark Boy. They then left the company. Afterwards Ron Harris retired from wrestling and became a born again Christian.\n\nOn December 5, 2009, Don Harris returned to the ring in ACW were he and The Patriot defeated Core and Mark Mest.\n\nOn May 22, 2010, Don Harris returned to ACW again where he, Big Vito, G-Raver, Kitt and The Rockin' Rebel defeated Louis G. Rich, High Voltage, Ed House, Andy Header and Matt Walsh.\n\nOn June 11, 2011, Don Harris returned to ACW one more time when he and Scotty Jefferies, along with Fred Flash and Pretty Fly for a White Guy, along with Oxx Hogg and Tommy Golden lost a 4-way tag team match to Moonshine Frank and Smasher LeBlanc. Afterwards Don Harris retired from wrestling.\n\nDon Harris effectively retired from the ring in 2003, and began working backstage with TNA as production manager. In the same year, Ron Harris retired from professional wrestling and began working for the Christian music label Beach Street Records. In 2007 Ron, Don and Frank Miller formed the Nashville-based management company O-Seven Artist Management.\n\nAlso, they work in Aroluxe, a marketing and production company. In 2016, TNA hired the services of Aroluxe. In April 2016, it was reported that Aroluxe was in negotiations with TNA over purchasing interest in the company.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Because Nixon's impeachment was for perjury, the case was cited as a precedent in the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton.\n\nBorn in 1928, in Biloxi, Mississippi, Nixon received a Juris Doctor in 1951 from Tulane University Law School. He entered private practice in Biloxi from 1952 to 1968, interrupted by service in the United States Air Force from 1953 to 1955.\n\nNixon was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson on May 29, 1968, to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, to a new seat authorized by 80 Stat. 75. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 6, 1968, and received his commission on June 7, 1968. He served as Chief Judge from 1982 to 1989. His service terminated on November 3, 1989, due to his impeachment and conviction.\n\nNixon was convicted in 1986 on perjury charges and sentenced to 5 years in prison. The offense stemmed from his grand jury testimony and statements to federal officers concerning his intervention in the state drug prosecution of Drew Fairchild, the son of Wiley Fairchild, a business partner of Nixon. Although the case was assigned to a state court, Wiley Fairchild had asked Nixon to help out by speaking to the prosecutor. Nixon did so, and the prosecutor, a long-time friend, dropped the case. When Nixon was interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United States Department of Justice, he denied any involvement whatsoever. Subsequently, a federal grand jury was empaneled and he again denied his involvement. He was convicted of making false statements to a grand jury. In 1989, he was impeached by the United States House of Representatives and convicted by the Senate, for committing perjury before a grand jury. Upon his conviction by the Senate, he was removed from office. \n\nNixon appealed his impeachment and removal to the United States Supreme Court. In \"Nixon v. United States\", handed down in 1993, the Court rejected his appeal as a nonjusticiable political question. He returned to private practice in Mississippi from 1993 to 1998. He has practiced law in Lake Charles, Louisiana since 1998.\n\n\n"}

One of two major newspapers published in the Tampa Bay area.\n\nThe newspaper also published a \"St. Petersburg Tribune\" edition, sold and distributed in Pinellas County. It published a Sunday magazine, \"Florida Accent\", during the 1960s and 1970s. \"The Tampa Tribune\" also operated \"Highlands Today\", a daily newspaper in Sebring. The \"Tribune\" stopped publishing the \"Hernando Today\", which was located in Brooksville, on December 1, 2014, citing \"a tough newspaper advertising climate.\"\n\nOn May 3, 2016, the \"Tampa Bay Times\" announced that it had acquired the \"Tribune\", and was combining the \"Times\" and \"Tribune\"s operations, ending publication of the \"Tribune\".\n\nDaily publication of the \"Tribune\" started in 1895 when Wallace Stovall upgraded printing from once a week.\n\nIn 1927, newspaper mogul John Stewart Bryan (of Richmond, Virginia) partnered with vice-president and general manager of the \"Chicago Tribune\" Samuel Emory Thomason to purchase \"The Tampa Tribune\" for $900,000.\n\nThe Tampa Tribune Publishing company grew to include the \"Tampa Tribune\", the \"Tampa Times\", \"TBO.com\", \"TampaBayOnline.com\", WFLA radio, and WFLA-TV.\n\nIn 1966, the \"Tampa Tribune\", along with sister properties WFLA-AM-FM-TV, was purchased by Richmond Newspapers, becoming Media General in 1969. Since 2000, the \"Tribune\" partnered with WFLA-TV and TBO.com in a converged arrangement, all connected with one another under owner Media General. The large media complex is located on Parker Street in Downtown Tampa. The \"Tribune\" was a flagship newspaper under the Media General banner until it was sold in 2012.\n\nExecutive editor Janet Coats left the paper in December 2009 and was not replaced until May 17, 2012, when managing editor Richard \"Duke\" Maas was promoted to executive editor.\n\nOn May 17, 2012, it was announced that investment company Berkshire Hathaway would be acquiring Media General's newspaper division; the purchase did not include the \"Tribune\" or its associated regional papers, which were being retained by Media General. No reason was given as to why Media General was retaining the \"Tribune\", but there was speculation that the paper would be sold to another party, such as Halifax Media Group (which owns several papers in Florida) or a completely different owner, or that the paper would merge with the \"Tampa Bay Times\". In October 2012, \"The Tampa Tribune\" and its associated print and digital products were acquired by Tampa Media Group, Inc., a new company formed by Revolution Capital Group.\n\nOn May 3, 2016, the \"Tampa Bay Times\" announced that it had acquired the \"Tribune\", and was combining the \"Times\" and \"Tribune\"s operations, ending publication of the \"Tribune\". The acquisition also includes \"Highlands Today\", weekly newspaper \"The Suncoast News\", and weekly Spanish-language newspaper \"Centro\"; all of these will continue publishing under Times' ownership. The \"Tampa Tribune\" name will be repurposed as a neighborhood news section of the Times.\n\nIn 1958, the \"Tribune\" acquired Tampa's struggling evening newspaper, the \"Tampa Daily Times.\" The \"Tribune\" published the paper as The Tampa Times until 1982. From then until the \"Tribune\" closed down, the \"Tribune\" displayed the logo for \"The Tampa Times\" in the masthead on the front section. This was part of an effort by the \"Tribune\" to keep its trademark on the \"Tampa Times\" name, and to avoid confusion with the then-\"St. Petersburg Times,\" which long published a Tampa edition. In 2006, it was decided in a lawsuit that the \"Tribune\" could keep its exclusive use of the \"Tampa Times\" name, but only for five years. This exclusivity ended at the end of 2011, allowing the \"St. Petersburg Times\" to rename itself the \"Tampa Bay Times\", effective January 1, 2012. The decision did not restrict the use of \"The Tampa Times\" name by the \"Tribune\" after the expiration of exclusivity.\n\nThe \"Tampa Tribune\" won a Pulitzer Prize in 1966 for local investigative specialized reporting. The award went to John Anthony Frasca for his \"investigation and reporting of two robberies that resulted in the freeing of an innocent man.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1910303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910303", "title": "Greektown, Chicago", "text": "Greektown, Chicago\n\nGreektown is a social and dining precinct, located on the Near West Side of the United States' city of Chicago, Illiniois. The precinct consists of mainly restaurants and businesses, as well as cultural sites and events. \n\nThe precinct can be found on Halsted Street, between Van Buren and Madison Streets.\n\nThe first Greek immigrants to settle in Chicago arrived in the 1840's via the Mississippi and Illinois rivers. The major fires of Chicago in 1871 caused significant further quantities of Greek immigrants to move to the area, inspired by the prospect of rebuilding the town of Chicago.\nThe original Greektown precinct on Halsted Street began with the Jane Addams Hull House, which acted as a meeting point for the Greek population within Chicago and provided a basis for community to be built from 1889. This house was used as a hub for the Greek community, and saw further small business expand within this area, despite small numbers, with 245 Greek people reported as living in Chicago, who were noted as predominantly young men of lower socio-economic background. This saw a slow expansion of restaurants, and various other stores throughout the century, with the Chicago tribune reporting in 1895 that ‘the Greeks have almost run the Italians out of the fruit business in Chicago not only on a small retail way, but as wholesalers as well’. \nAttempts to unite the various Greek restaurants in the area as well as the wider city were made with the establishment of ‘Hermes’, a Greek business group in 1910. This group initially failed to gain traction amongst business owners. In the longer term, however, it united the Greek community, writing bylaws for its member businesses and organising social events, laying the framework for current regulatory bodies such as the Greektown organisation.\nBy 1930, the area which had become known as the ‘Greek Delta’, held a foreign and native-born population of over 30,000. This population continued its growth and expansion with the precinct growing in size and area. This continued until 1960, when the opening of the University of Illinois Chicago campus, as well as the construction and opening of the Eisenhower Expressway, forced the precinct to move North along Halsted street to its  location between Van Buren and Madison streets. The majority of functioning organisations and restaurants operating within the Greektown precinct opened within the 1970-1990 period following relocation to the precinct’s space between Van Buren and Madison streets. \nThe onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 saw bars and restaurants within the precinct close for business and events either postponed or cancelled due to public-health related Illinois state laws.\nGreektown is easily accessible via public transportation by riding the Chicago \"L\"'s Blue Line to the UIC-Halsted station and heading north, or via the #8 Halsted bus route.\nThere are various events occurring in the Greektown precinct, varying in scale from weekly to annually.\n‘A Taste of Greektown’ is an annual culinary and cultural event held within the Greektown precinct, held in the month of August.\n\nThe stated aim of the festival is to combine ‘old world traditions with 21 century freshness’ in the Greek cuisine, through the use of local neighbourhood food producers and vendors. The event additionally offers entertainment through Greek bands and entertainment, as well as games for children. This event Is held between Adams Street and Van Buren street on 315 South Halsted street. This event saw the 30 anniversary of its founding occur in 2019.\nThe Greektown precinct organisation also offer various events which occur on a more regular basis, such as monthly Greek dancing classes. Many events scheduled for early 2020, however, such as the ‘12 District CAPS meeting’ for citizens to raise queries and concerns with local police, were either cancelled or postponed due to restrictions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe prominent cultural site within the Greektown precinct is the National Hellenic Museum, situated on 333 South Halsted street.\n\nThis museum was established initially in 1983, with its new facility on Halsted street officially opened in 2011. The museum states its purpose as depicting and upholding the legacy of Greek culture within the United States through education. In its depiction of the Greek experience and legacy within the united states, the museum utilises over 20,000 resources. These include texts, artefacts, photographs and newspapers, as well as over 400 recorded accounts. The museum receives regular visits organised through the ‘Office of Tourism’s Chicago Neighbourhoods’ program, as well as over 10,000 public school students from Chicago every year.\nThe museum regularly updates and introduces exhibits, such as the ‘Reaching for the American Dream: The Greek Story in America’ exhibit, gifted by Angela G Paterakis. This exhibit, through utilising firsthand accounts, photographs and artefacts, traces the story of Hellenic culture and its integration into the USA through involvement in major historical events, and establishing businesses and communities.  The museum has also taken over exhibits from other museums, such as the Cyprus Museum of Jackson Florida’s entire collection, which included artefacts numbering over 300.\nThe strategic plan for the Greektown precinct is a document outlining the intended future plan of business operations for the Greektown precinct, compiled by the Lakota group. This process began on December 1, 2017 with surveys, interviews and reviews amongst local businesses and stakeholders. This was followed by more canvassing and stakeholder consultancy, with the final Strategic plan published in March 2019.\nThe overarching purpose behind this plans publication is to outline a clear path for continued economic sustenance for the Greektown district, whilst ensuring that its heritage and cultural significance for the Greek community is not diminished. It is a 123-page document, outlining intentions to ‘enhance Greektown as a compelling cultural destination’, a ‘vibrant business district’ and as a ‘prosperous and collaborative neighbourhood’. \nThe report also states its intended methods to achieve these goals, including storefront and façade decoration enhancements, as well as prioritising various ‘action items’ in order to increase public engagement with the precinct, such as the introduction of a year long calendar, detailing planned events and promotions within the precinct. These activities have been designed whilst considering the propensity for property ownership and prices, as well as zoning to change in the future.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1910311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910311", "title": "Clash of the Champions", "text": "Clash of the Champions\n\nThe Clash of the Champions is a series of professional wrestling television specials that were produced by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) in conjunction with National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). The specials were supercards comprising pay-per-view caliber matches, similar to World Wrestling Federation's (WWF) \"Saturday Night's Main Event\". \"Clash of the Champions\" shows were famous for typically not airing commercials during matches even though many of these matches were 20 minutes or more.\n\nThe first \"Clash of the Champions\" was held on March 27, 1988 by JCP and was entitled NWA: Clash of the Champions. Subsequent Clash events had different subtitles, i.e. \"Clash of the Champions II: Miami Mayhem\", up until \"Clash of the Champions XVI: Fall Brawl 1991\" which was the last event with a subtitle. Jim Crockett Promotions was sold to Ted Turner and renamed World Championship Wrestling in 1988, and WCW continued to air the events until 1997. The rights to \"Clash of the Champions\" now belong to WWE. All 35 episodes are available for on-demand viewing on the WWE Network.\nThroughout 1987 and 1988, a bitter event scheduling war broke out between rival wrestling promoters Vince McMahon and Jim Crockett, Jr. On Thanksgiving night 1987, McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF) aired \"Survivor Series\" against Starrcade from Crockett and the National Wrestling Alliance, two pay-per-view (PPV) events on the same day. At that time, many cable companies could only offer one live PPV event at a time, and furthermore were presented with an edict from the WWF saying that any cable company that chose to carry Starrcade would be barred from carrying any future WWF events. Hence, the WWF PPV was cleared 10-1 over Starrcade.\n\nFollowing this incident, McMahon was warned by the PPV industry not to schedule PPV events simultaneously with the NWA again. However, he was still not willing to fully cooperate with Crockett, and on January 24, 1988, another scheduling conflict took place between the WWF and NWA. The NWA presented the Bunkhouse Stampede on PPV, while on the same night, the WWF aired the first Royal Rumble for free on the USA Network.\n\nIn 1988, with the WWF's WrestleMania IV around the corner, Crockett decided to give McMahon a taste of his own medicine. He aired his own supercard, \"Clash of the Champions\" for free on TBS on March 27, 1988 - the same night as \"WrestleMania\". The first \"Clash\" was of PPV caliber and made Sting a star after he wrestled NWA World Champion Ric Flair to a 45-minute draw. WCW would repeat the practice again the following year with a \"Clash\" coinciding with the WWF's WrestleMania V. Although the main event of NWA Champion Ricky Steamboat defeating Flair in a best of three falls match was widely considered the best wrestling match that took place among the two promotions on that day, ratings and attendance for the event fell well below expectations due to the event not being advertised and the practice of conflicting major events would cease until the Monday Night Wars began in 1995.\n\n\"Clash\" events continued on a sporadic basis over the next nine years, quickly changing focus to become a free marketing vehicle for NWA/WCW PPV events, similar to the WWF's \"Saturday Night's Main Event\". WCW aired the 35th and last \"Clash of the Champions\" on August 21, 1997. In 1997 the determination was made to discontinue air \"Clash of the Champions\" due to the start of \"Thunder\".\n\nWWE, the owner of the WCW properties since 2001, resurrected the name under the WWE Clash of Champions pay-per-view starting in 2016.\n\nClash of the Champions (known sequentially as Clash of the Champions I) took place on March 27, 1988 at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina. There were 6,000 people in attendance and the show drew a 5.6 rating on TBS. This was aired head to head with WWF WrestleMania IV. In a \"College Rules\" match, Mike Rotunda won with a cradle for the one-count pin 1:10 into the second round.\nIn a match for the United States Tag Team Championship, The Fantastics' Tommy Rogers originally pinned The Midnight Express's Bobby Eaton to win the titles but the decision was reversed because Rogers' partner, Bobby Fulton, had thrown referee Randy Anderson over the top rope before the pinfall was made. The Road Warriors and Dusty Rhodes defeated The Powers of Pain and Ivan Koloff when The Barbarian accidentally hit his partner, The Warlord, with a diving headbutt. Animal wore a goalie mask during the match to protect his injured face.\n\nLex Luger and Barry Windham defeated Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard for the World Tag Team Championship, when interference by the champions' manager J.J. Dillon backfired; Dillon held a chair on the apron but Lex Luger whipped Arn Anderson into the chair.\n\nIn the main event, Sting challenged Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Flair's manager, J.J. Dillon was suspended in a cage above the ring. As no wrestler scored a decision before the time limit expired, the decision was left to the judges appointed for this occasion: wrestling official Gary Juster awarded the match to Sting, while Penthouse model Patty Mullen decided in favour of Flair. Wrestling official Sandy Scott ruled the match a draw. No decision was announced for the remaining two judges, actors Jason Hervey and Ken Osmond, resulting the match being ruled a draw and Flair retaining the title.\n\nClash of the Champions II took place on June 8, 1988 at the James L. Knight Center in Miami, Florida. There were 2,400 people in attendance and the show drew a 4.8 rating on TBS. Throughout the show, wrestlers were being interviewed as they arrived to the building, most notably, Lex Luger who was attacked by the Four Horsemen and was busted open after being slammed head first into the trunk of his limo. This was a big deal at the time as it was the first time Luger had bled while in the NWA. This would also be an important factor in the conclusion of Luger's match against Ric Flair at the 1988 Great American Bash PPV. Kevin Sullivan was locked in a cage at ringside during the third match but stole the key from the Garvins’ valet Precious. Steve Williams ran in after the match to save the Garvins from a 3 on 2 beat down. Al Perez was disqualified when Larry Zbyszko interfered in the match attacking Koloff. The referee is knocked out near the end of the main event prompting Ric Flair and Barry Windham to interfere, resulting in a double disqualification.\n\nClash of the Champions III took place on September 7, 1988 at the Albany Civic Center in Albany, Georgia. There were 3,700 people in attendance and the show drew a 5.4 rating on TBS. \"Fall Brawl\" would later become a regular PPV event for WCW. After the match Steve Williams ran to the ring to congratulate Brad Armstrong. Armstrong replaced Tim Horner, who left the company in August. Despite the match not being announced as a no-DQ match, Kevin Sullivan (wrestler) is not disqualified when Al Perez interferes in the match. Dusty Rhodes won the match by pinning Gary Hart and not the legal opponent Kevin Sullivan. The bout was originally scheduled as Rhodes and Dick Murdoch vs Al Perez and Ron Garvin. Garvin left the company in August and the bout was changed. Ivan Koloff had manager Paul Jones and The Russian Assassin at ringside. After accidentally costing Koloff the match Paul Jones and the Russian Assassin attacked Koloff soon joined by a second masked Russian Assassin turning Koloff face. Barry Windham was disqualified after hitting Sting with a chair. The referee didn't actually see the chairshot but is informed of it by San Francisco 49er John Ayers who came to ringside.\n\nClash of the Champions IV took place on December 7, 1988 at the UTC Arena in Chattanooga, Tennessee. This was the first \"Clash of the Champions\" following the sale of Jim Crockett Promotions to Turner Broadcasting and the subsequent company name change to World Championship Wrestling. There were 8,000 people in attendance and the show drew a 4.5 rating on TBS. This show set up Starrcade '88. It was on this show that TBS/WCW experimented with a top down camera angle, which did not catch on. This is comparable to the \"refer-eye\" camera from Halloween Havoc '91. This was the finals of the tournament to crown new United States Tag Team champions, the titles were vacated when the Midnight Express won the NWA World Tag Team titles in September. Ron Simmons and Eddie Gilbert had originally lost to the Sheepherders in the semi-finals but the decision was reversed when the Sheepherders signed with the World Wrestling Federation. Ivan Koloff pinned Paul Jones after hitting him with Jones’ own illegal object. Koloff had one arm tied behind his back during the entire match. The Russian Assassins attack Koloff after the match only for the Junkyard Dog to make the save. Dusty Rhodes was disqualified for hitting Road Warrior Animal with a chair. Both Hawk and Sting had already interfered in the match. The Road Warriors chose Genichiro Tenryu to be the 3rd champion on the December 10th edition of NWA World Championship Wrestling\n\nClash of the Champions V took place on February 15, 1989 at the Cleveland Convention Center in Cleveland, Ohio. There were 5,000 people in attendance and the show drew a 4.6 rating on TBS. This show was warm up show for the Chi-Town Rumble PPV only 5 days later. Steven Casey was billed as \"undefeated\" coming into this match. The masked Blackmailer was Jack Victory who did double duty on the night (he was also Russian Assassin #2) Mike Rotunda replaced Kevin Sullivan in the match, Sullivan and Williams originally won the US titles. The main event match was declared a double disqualification when Sting, Junkyard Dog and Michael Hayes stormed the ring. Sting, JYD and Hayes were originally slated to face the Road Warriors and Tenryu but were locked in by Kevin Sullivan before the match. A Ric Flair scheduled interview resulted in a Ricky Steamboat confrontation and an unscheduled in-ring, and out-of-ring, brawl, resulting in Flair losing all his clothes except his socks and trunks. The ring announcer for the night was former IWA and WWF Play-by-Play announcer Jack Reynolds.\n\nClash of the Champions VI took place on April 2, 1989 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. There were 5,300 people in attendance and the show drew a 4.3 rating on TBS. This show was used to build the WrestleWar 1989 PPV on May 7. Clash VI was held on the same day as WrestleMania V and on free TV in an attempt to hurt the PPV rating.\n\nThe Samoan Swat Team defeated The Midnight Express when Fatu hit Bobby Eaton with Paul E. Dangerously's phone without the referee seeing it. This was the continuation of the Jim Cornette/Paul E. Dangerously feud that started when Dangerously brought the \"Original Midnight Express\" to WCW.\n\nThe Varsity Club (Mike Rotunda and Steve Williams) defeated The Road Warriors when Williams cradled Hawk for the pinfall. The match was marred by controversial officiating: referee Teddy Long refused to count a pinfall for the Road Warriors only moments before making a fast count on Williams pinning Hawk. Long was subsequently fired as a referee and became a manager.\n\nNWA World Champion Ricky Steamboat was challenged by former champion Ric Flair in a two out of three falls match. The results of the falls were:\n\nThe replay would show that Flair's foot was under the bottom rope, allowing him to get one last rematch at WrestleWar 1989.\n\nIn non-televised dark matches, Sting made Rip Morgan submit to the Scorpion Deathlock and Lex Luger forced Jack Victory to submit with the Torture Rack. Both matches were later shown on \"NWA World Championship Wrestling\".\n\nMatches 4, 5, and 6 are edited out on the WWE Network showing.\n\nClash of the Champions VII took place on June 14, 1989 at the Ritz-Epps Fitness Center in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The show drew a 3.8 rating on TBS. This show was used to build the Great American Bash 1989 PPV on July 23. Jimmy Garvin replaced Terry Gordy who participated in the first round match; it was Garvin's debut as an official Freebird, although he had been an \"undercover\" Freebird since 1983. The Freebirds beat The Road Warriors in the first round while the Dynamic Dudes beat Jack Victory and Rip Morgan. Jack Victory once again appears at a Clash of Champions under a mask, having previously appeared as \"Russian Assassin #2\" and \"The Blackmailer\" when the bookers needed a generic heel. The Ding Dongs won after a flying kneedrop / flying elbow double team move The Ding Dongs were Jim Evans and Richard Sartain who only wrestled a handful of matches under this gimmick. Stan Lane pinned Samu after the Road Warriors ran in and attacked the Samoan Swat Team while the referee was knocked out. The Midnight Express beat Bob Orton, Jr. and Butch Reed in the first round while the Samoan Swat Team beat Ranger Ross and Ron Simmons. This match is one of the very first matches the Steiner Brothers had together. Jim Cornette was attacked by Paul E. Dangerously early in the match and helped to the back by the Dynamic Dudes. Terry Funk is disqualified for hitting Ricky Steamboat with the microphone. Funk beat down on Steamboat after the match until Lex Luger made the save. After running Funk off Luger turns on Steamboat and attacks him as well.\n\nClash of the Champions VIII took place on September 12, 1989 at the Carolina Coliseum in Columbia, South Carolina. There were 2,600 fans in attendance and the show drew a 4.7 rating on TBS.

{"id": "1910313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910313", "title": "Level (video games)", "text": "Level (video games)\n\nA level, map, area, stage, world, track, board, floor, zone, phase, mission, episode, or course in a video game is the total space available to the player during the course of completing a discrete objective. Video game levels generally have progressively increasing difficulty to appeal to players with different skill levels. Each level presents new content and challenges to keep player's interest high.\n\nIn games with linear progression, levels are areas of a larger world, such as Green Hill Zone. Games may also feature interconnected levels, representing locations.\n\nLevel design or environment design is a discipline of game development involving creation of video game levels—locales, stages, or missions.\n\nA level editor (also known as a map, campaign or scenario editor) is a game development tool used to design levels, maps, campaigns and virtual worlds for a video game. An individual involved with the creation of game levels is a level designer or mapper. \n\nIn some cases, the creator of a video game includes built-in level editing tools, for example, a track editor for a racing game. Other times they may release an official level editor for the game as a separate application. Sometimes players of the game create fan-made level editors.\n\nOne of the first 3D games which became popular partially due to level editors and fan-made content was \"Doom\". The creation of various third-party editors led to the birth of an online community trading fan-made maps.\n\nA level editor is often limited to creating levels for only a certain game engine. Developing a level editor takes a lot of time and it is more time and cost efficient to release multiple games using the same engine instead of developing a new engine and level editor for each game. Level editors offer some limited scope of content creation, but in the case of gaming industry solutions the scope is very large allowing an entire game to be created without the need for much support from a programming team. To make larger changes to a game than simply adding new levels, a software development kit (SDK) is sometimes needed.\n\nIn the early years of video-gaming, some games came with a utility called a \"construction set\". This was similar in many ways to a level-editor. Some games used them to create extra levels, whereas others (like the \"Shoot-'Em-Up Construction Kit\") used them as a means to create a game rather than be a game in itself.\n\nA bonus stage (also known as a bonus level or bonus round) is a special level within a video game designed to reward the player or players, and typically allows the player to collect extra points or power-ups. Bonus stage either have no enemies or hazards, or replace the normal penalties for being struck by enemies or hazards with simply being thrown out of the bonus stage. Many bonus stages need to be activated or discovered in some manner, or certain conditions must be satisfied to access them. Otherwise, they appear after the player has completed a certain number of regular stages.\n\n\n"}

They find her, but much time has passed and she now works for the Forge and goes by the name of Artemis. At the Forge on Dartmoor, Nimrod conducts a terrible experiment on the Doctor, attempting to force him to regenerate by electrocution.

Cassie tells Evelyn that she knows the secret that she keeps from the Doctor — she has a heart condition and had had an attack just before travelling with the Doctor.

{"id": "1910356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910356", "title": "On Your Toes", "text": "On Your Toes\n\nOn Your Toes (1936) is a musical with a book by Richard Rodgers, George Abbott, and Lorenz Hart, music by Rodgers, and lyrics by Hart. It was adapted into a film in 1939.\n\nWhile teaching music at Knickerbocker University, Phil \"Junior\" Dolan III tries to persuade Sergei Alexandrovich, the director of the Russian Ballet, to stage the jazz ballet \"Slaughter on Tenth Avenue\". After becoming involved with the company's prima ballerina Vera Barnova, Junior is forced to assume the male lead in \"Slaughter\". Trouble ensues when he becomes the target of two thugs hired by Vera's lover and dance partner to kill him.\n\n\"On Your Toes\" marked the first time a Broadway musical made dramatic use of classical dance and incorporated jazz into its score.\n\n\"On Your Toes\" originally was conceived as a film, and as a vehicle for Fred Astaire. His refusal of the part, because he thought that the role clashed with his debonair image developed in his contemporary films, caused it to be presented initially as a stage production. Richard Rodgers wrote: \"Astaire at that point in his career was a pretty chic fellow who usually wore white ties and tails, and the producers felt that there was no chance in our script for him to appear that way.\" Astaire thought that the ballet background in the plot was too \"highbrow\" for his audiences. Ray Bolger was given the stage role, which allowed him to rise to stardom. Eddie Albert, not known as a dancer in his career, gave a remarkable performance opposite Vera Zorina in the 1939 film.\n\nThe first Broadway production, directed by C. Worthington Miner and choreographed by George Balanchine, opened on April 11, 1936, at the Imperial Theatre, where it ran for seven months, then transferred to the Majestic, for a total run of 315 performances. The cast included Ray Bolger, Tamara Geva, and Monty Woolley.\n\nThe London West End production opened on 5 February 1937, at the Palace Theatre, with Jack Whiting and Vera Zorina as the dancers.\n\nThe first Broadway revival, directed by Abbott and choreographed by Balanchine, opened on October 11, 1954 at the 46th Street Theatre, where it ran for 64 performances. The cast included Vera Zorina, Bobby Van, Elaine Stritch, and David Winters. The original score was embellished with \"You Took Advantage of Me.\"\n\nThe second revival, directed by Abbott and choreographed by Donald Saddler, started in 1982 with national previews. One of the original cast members, Natalia Makarova, was injured during the preview at the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Valentina Kozlova filled in the role, and Leonid Kozlov, her former husband, replaced George de la Peña to complete the previews. After seven previews, the revival opened on March 6, 1983 at the Virginia Theatre with the original cast, where it ran for 505 performances. The cast included Natalia Makarova, Christine Andreas, George de la Peña, George S. Irving, Dina Merrill, Philip Arthur Ross, Betty Ann Grove and Lara Teeter.\n\n\nOn a vaudeville stage, Phil Dolan II, his wife Lili, and his son Junior perform their nightly routine, but afterwards in the dressing-room, the parents tell Junior that he must go to school. Fifteen years later, as predicted, Junior is a music teacher at Knickerbocker University. He has two talented students: Sidney Cohn and Frankie Frayne. Sidney has written a promising jazz ballet which Frankie catches Junior dancing to alone in the classroom (uncovering his \"secret past\"), and she trades an introduction to the Russian Ballet's manager in return for his listening to her song.\n\nIn the apartment of Vera Baranova, star of the Russian Ballet, Peggy, the manager, enthusiastically tells Sergei, the company's director, about the new jazz ballet. He is not interested in anything new - he doesn't even recognise that the Revolution has happened! Junior arrives as Vera and co-star/unfaithful lover Morrisone are having a Russian screaming match. The others leave, so that Vera and Junior can discuss the new ballet, but that leads to a new entanglement.\n\nBack in the classroom, Frankie is jealous of Junior's stories about Vera and the Russians (Peggy has promised him a chance to dance in the corps de ballet), and they both wish they were away from it all. At the opening of the ballet, \"La Princesse Zenobia\", Junior is told that one of the dancers is in jail and he must take his place, but onstage he gets all his steps, rhythms and positions cock-eyed and makes a laughing-stock of the ballet. But the audience loves it, nevertheless.\n\n\nSergei, Peggy, Vera, Morrosine and Junior have listened to the jazz ballet. Opinions are mixed, and Vera and Morrosine are still arguing, as he becomes increasingly jealous of Junior. Poor Junior has got love problems, too: he upsets Frankie by going to lunch with Vera (for business reasons) instead of her, but she is \"Glad to Be Unhappy\".\n\nThen Peggy, Sergei, and some of the company visit Junior's school. Sergei has come to break the bad news that he will not be doing the jazz ballet, but Peggy persuades him by threatening to pull out the million dollars she has put into the company. After Sergei's announcement that the next production will be \"Slaughter on Tenth Avenue\", the class stages the title number \"On Your Toes\", in which the students' jazz and the company's classical routines are deftly combined.\n\nAt a rehearsal, Morrosine's jealousy of Junior escalates, he fights with Sergei and is knocked–out, suddenly making Junior the new star. The humiliated Morrosine plots with his gangster friend, Louie, to shoot Junior at the end of the performance. Joe, the stage doorman, overhears and warns Frankie. On-stage, Junior is tipped–off and signals to the conductor to avoid the final loud climax which would cover the shot, so he keeps the orchestra playing the last few bars of the music over and over as Junior dances frantically to keep the shooter from firing until the police arrest him. After the curtain call, Frankie embraces Junior and is startled to see his parents waiting to congratulate him. The music-teacher has made it back to his home-ground - the stage.\n\n\nIn 1939, Warner Bros. filmed \"On Your Toes\" as adapted by Sig Herzig and Lawrence Riley and written by Richard Macauley and Jerry Wald, with Ray Enright directing. The film stars ballerina Vera Zorina (billed as Zorina), Eddie Albert, Alan Hale and Frank McHugh, and features Leonid Kinskey, Gloria Dickson, James Gleason, Erik Rhodes, Berton Churchill and Donald O'Connor.\n\nAlthough some of the songs from the Broadway score were used as background music, the film does not have any singing in it. The \"Slaughter on Tenth Avenue\" ballet does appear at the end of the film, with choreography by George Balanchine, one of eight films for which he created the dances. Eddie Albert's character dances the lead in the ballet, opposite Zorina.

Forty-eight airports facilitate public flights, including one heliport, Værøy Heliport. Forty-five of these are owned by the government through its airport operator, Avinor. Scheduled airports are grouped into primary airports, which are sufficiently large to serve jetliners, and regional airports, which can only handle regional aircraft.\n\nThe airports used only for general aviation (GA) are owned by a mix of municipalities, aviation clubs and private companies. The latter include some which are controlled by the state or municipalities. Two are owned by the Norwegian Armed Forces. The Royal Norwegian Air Force has ten air stations which are co-located with primary airports (\"joint\" airports).\nOslo Airport, Gardermoen is by a factor of almost four the busiest airport in the country, about half of which is international services. It opened in 1998—replacing Oslo Airport, Fornebu— and serves as a hub for Norwegian Air Shuttle and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS). It is followed by three other major airports, Bergen Airport, Flesland; Stavanger Airport, Sola; and Trondheim Airport, Værnes. These act as focus cities for said airlines. The four next airports are of almost equal size. Sandefjord Airport, Torp serves low-cost airlines in Eastern Norway and are often branded as \"Oslo\" by airlines such as Ryanair. Bodø Airport and Tromsø Airport act as hubs within Northern Norway, from which Widerøe flies to regional airports. Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen have a similar function in Southern Norway.\nNorway is the country in Europe with the most airline trips per capita. The routes from Oslo to Trondheim, Bergen and Stavanger are all amongst the ten busiest in Europe. Contributing causes are a low population density, a rugged geography and limited population in the interior and the north, which combined have resulted in a poor road and rail infrastructure. Many smaller airport have short runways which permit only fairly small aircraft on short routes. Future lack of compatible aircraft has started plans to extending some, close down some (combined with road improvement) and to replace a few with new airports.\n\nThe list includes fixed-wing airports approved by the CAA and those with an ICAO code. In addition, closed land airports are included if they were either issued ICAO codes or they served scheduled flights. Heliports are only included if they have scheduled flights and are part of the regional aviation system. Water aerodromes are excluded.\n\nThe list contains the airport name, the city served and the county in which the airport is located (which may differ from the county of the city served). The type of airport is subdivided into primary airports, regional airports (one marked as a heliport), military (used exclusively by the Norwegian Armed Forces), joint (airports with both a civilian airport and a military air base), GA (used exclusively for general aviation) and closed airports. The ownership consists of airports owned by Avinor, municipally-owned airports, airports owned by the military, those owned by aviation clubs, and privately owned through a limited company. The list further states the ICAO code and the International Air Transport Association airport code (IATA code). The length of the longest runway (rwy) is stated. Passenger data (pax) is for 2016 and counts both boarding and disembarking passengers. Airport names shown in bold indicate airports with scheduled service on commercial airlines.\n\n"}

At some stage they moved to Strassburg where they were recorded as being Anabaptists. Idelette and John Stordeur had two children (Charles, Judith) before Stordeur died after a brief illness, leaving Idelette a widow.\n\nCalvin was so caught up in his labors that he did not seem to consider marriage until age 30 or so. He asked friends to help him find a woman who was \"chaste, obliging, not fastidious, economical, patient, and careful for (his) health\". His fellow laborer Martin Bucer had known Idelette and recommended her to Calvin in confidence that she would fit the bill. They married in August 1540.\n\nIdelette bore Calvin one son and possibly a few daughters, all of whom died in infancy. In response to the slander of Catholics who took this for a judgment upon them for being heretics, Calvin said he was content with his many sons in the faith. Idelette busied herself attending to Calvin in his many illnesses, faithfully visiting the sick and afflicted, and making her home a refuge for those who fled for their lives and their faith.\n\nThough she survived the plague when it ravaged Geneva, Idelette died after a lengthy illness in 1549.

Dyer's breakthrough role was as Moff in \"Human Traffic\", with other notable roles as Billy the Limpet in \"Mean Machine\", and as Tommy Johnson in \"The Football Factory\". Following the success of \"The Football Factory\", Dyer was often typecast in \"hard-man\" roles, although it was this image that allowed him to present \"The Real Football Factories\", its spin-off, \"The Real Football Factories International\" and \"Danny Dyer's Deadliest Men\". Dyer has also worked in theatre, having appeared in three plays written by Harold Pinter, with whom he had a close friendship.\n\nIn 2013, he joined the cast of the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\", in the role of Mick Carter. He had previously turned down a role in 2009, and in his autobiography, \"Straight Up\", said that he would not join the cast until he was \"fat, bald and fifty\". He won the Serial Drama Performance award at the National Television Awards in 2015, 2016, and 2019. In 2019, he began presenting the BBC game show \"The Wall\".\n\nDyer was born in Custom House, East London, in 1977, the son of Antony and Christine (\"née\" Meakin). He has a younger brother, Tony (born 1979), and sister, Kayleigh (born 1986). His parents split up when he was nine and he was raised by his mother in Custom House. He began acting when he was a teen, and was bullied at school so badly by his peers that he lied about taking acting classes.\n\nIn 2016, the Dyer family were the subject of an episode of \"Who Do You Think You Are?\", a BBC documentary series that researches the family history of celebrities. Research revealed that his family hails from the Poplar area. Census records showed many of them working in the manual occupations connected to the docks on the River Thames. Tracing his ancestors even further back, research found that his 15× great grandfather was Thomas Cromwell. His 14× great grandmother was Elizabeth Seymour, the sister of Jane Seymour, who was Henry VIII's third wife. Elizabeth married Cromwell's son Gregory Cromwell and, with the Seymour family's assertion to be descended from Edward III (his 22× great grandfather), the line stretched back to William the Conqueror. In response, geneticist Adam Rutherford said that an English person's descent from Edward III was not remarkable because \"almost every Briton\" can claim such descent.\n\nDyer was discovered at a local school by an agent who auditioned him for the part of Martin Fletcher in the Granada Television series \"Prime Suspect 3\" (1993), beginning his acting career at 16.\n\nHe also appeared on television in episodes of \"Cadfael\" (1994), \"A Touch of Frost\" (1995), \"Loved Up\" (1995), \"Thief Takers\" (1996) and \"Soldier Soldier\" (1997).\n\nHis many other television roles include appearances in the 2003 Channel 4 drama \"Second Generation\", directed by John Sen; as Malcolm, main character Michelle's stepfather, in \"Skins\"; as a football player in the second series of \"Hotel Babylon\"; and as Matt Costello in what was supposed to be the pilot episode for \"Breathless\", a BBC two-part television series in development from BBC Northern Ireland, renamed first \"Blood Rush\" and then \"Kiss of Death\", when it premiered on BBC One as a one-part drama on 26 May 2008.\n\nBeginning in 2007, Dyer became the presenter of \"The Real Football Factories\" and \"The Real Football Factories International\", a TV documentary series on Bravo, for which he travels, in the former throughout the United Kingdom and in the latter throughout the world, to meet and interview football club fans and hooligans. In \"Danny Dyer's Deadliest Men\", \"a gritty and hard-hitting documentary series that sees him venturing into the dark depths of the British underworld and hunting down some of the most notorious and feared men in Britain today\", began airing on Bravo in the United Kingdom on 20 October 2008.\n\nIn April 2009, he turned down a role in \"EastEnders\", claiming that although he thought the role sounded good, he did not think he could cope with the pressure.\n\nIn February 2012, Dyer appeared as a paramedic in an episode of \"Casualty\". In March 2013, Dyer appeared as a guest on \"Celebrity Juice\". Dyer appeared in the sixth series of \"Hollyoaks Later\" in October 2013, as The White Man.\n\nOn 1 October 2013, the BBC announced that Dyer had been cast in \"EastEnders\" from Christmas 2013, as Mick Carter, the new landlord of The Queen Victoria pub.\n\nIn February 2017 it was announced that Dyer would be taking a \"short break\" from \"EastEnders\".\n\nIn June 2018, Dyer appeared as a guest panelist on \"Good Evening Britain\", a one-off spin-off show of \"Good Morning Britain\", to discuss Britain's exit from the European Union. Dyer described it as a \"mad riddle that no one knows what it is\" and called the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron, a \"twat\". In August 2018, Dyer began narrating MTV reality series, \"True Love or True Lies\".\n\nIn 2019, Dyer appeared in a history documentary, titled \"Danny Dyer's Right Royal Family\". The two-part series premiered on BBC One on 23 January 2019.\n\nDyer is best known for his \"bad boy\" or \"hard man\" roles in film. Dyer's first film role was in \"Human Traffic\" (1999). His subsequent movie work includes Mel Smith's \"High Heels and Low Lifes\" (2001) and starring roles in \"Borstal Boy\" (2000), \"Mean Machine\" (2002) and in four films by the British film director Nick Love: \"Goodbye Charlie Bright\" (2001); \"The Football Factory\" (2004); \"The Business\" (2005); and \"Outlaw\" (2007). Among other film roles, he also appeared as the character Steve in Christopher Smith's \"Severance\" (2006); as Hayden in \"Adulthood\" (2008); and as himself in the feature documentary \"Tattoos: A Scarred History\".\n\nIn 2008, he finished filming his roles as Pete and Tom in \"City Rats\" and \"7 Lives\", respectively. April 2009 saw the straight to DVD release of \"City Rats\". Later that year, Dyer completed filming on \"Jack Said\", a Brit noir thriller in which he played Nathan alongside Ashlie Walker, Terry Stone, David O'Hara and Simon Phillips, which was released in November 2009. This film is the prequel to \"Jack Says\", which was released in 2008, and starred Mike Reid.\n\nIn 2009, he shot several horror films including \"Doghouse\" under the direction of Jake West, and \"Basement\" under the direction of Asham Kamboj. He played one of the lead roles in the British vampire film \"Dead Cert\". In June 2010, he was cast for the lead role in the remake of the British horror film \"The Asphyx\", but it failed to secure production finance and was indefinitely shelved. Dyer co-starred with Anna Walton in \"Deviation\", a British dark thriller written and directed by J. K. Amalou.\n\nIn 2012, Dyer played the lead role in Ray Cooney's \"Run For Your Wife\". Upon release in 2013, it was savaged by critics, who described it as one of the worst British films of all time. The film took in a mere £747 during its opening weekend.\n\nDyer has performed on stage, most notably in two plays written and directed by 2005 Nobel Laureate Harold Pinter: as the Waiter in the London première of \"Celebration\" (2000), at the Almeida Theatre, which transferred to Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, in New York, as part of the Harold Pinter Festival held there in July and August 2001; and as Foster in the revival of \"No Man's Land\" (1975), at the Royal National Theatre, in London, during 2001 and 2002. In March 2008, he played Joey in a revival of Pinter's \"The Homecoming\" (1964), directed by Michael Attenborough, at the Almeida Theatre, in London. He also performed in Peter Gill's play \"Certain Young Men\" (1999) in London.\n\nFrom 9 September 2009 to 3 October 2009, Dyer appeared as Sid Vicious in a new play called \"Kurt and Sid\" in London's West End at the Trafalgar Studios.\n\nDyer is the voice of in the video games \"\" (2002) and \"\" (2004).\n\nHe also appears in The Twang's 2007 video for \"Two Lovers\".\n\n\"I Believe in UFOS: Danny Dyer\", a documentary that sees Dyer journey to various \"UFO hotspots\" in the UK and the US in hope of experiencing a UFO sighting, was broadcast on BBC Three on 26 January 2010.\n\nIn 2016, he appeared in drag in the Lucy Rose music video for \"Nebraska\".\n\nDyer currently lives in Debden, Epping Forest, Essex, with his wife, Joanne Mas, and their three children. He first began dating Mas in 1992; he was 18 when their first child, daughter Dani, was born. They also have a daughter Sunnie and son, Artie. During March 2015, Mas proposed to Dyer, and the couple married on 3 September 2016. In June 2017, it was reported that Dyer had a \"six-week affair\" with Sarah Harding. From June to July 2018, Dyer's eldest daughter, Dani Dyer, appeared as a contestant in the ITV2 reality dating series \"Love Island\", which she eventually won alongside her then-boyfriend, Jack Fincham.\n\nDyer has been open about his use of drugs. In his autobiography he states: \"I've always taken drugs and I probably always will, but there's a difference between having the odd crafty bump up the snout as a reward for a job well done and letting it rule your life.\" He has argued for cocaine to be legalised because he argues banning it has \"not worked\".\n\nA lifelong player and follower of football, Dyer is a West Ham United fan. In late December 2007, he became the chairman of Kent League's Greenwich Borough F.C. in South East London, appointed by fellow actor Tamer Hassan, president of the football club, stating: \"I just love football and the chance of being involved with a club is like a dream come true.\" The appointment was actually a publicity stunt to raise the profile of the club.\n\nIn 2016, Dyer travelled to Sierra Leone to take part in Sport Relief. Dyer said \"I don't know what to expect when I go over there, but I'm hoping that it will make some kind of difference. It's an honour to be asked.\"\n\nDyer in 2011 released his autobiography \"Straight Up\" and in 2016 \"The World According to Danny Dyer: Life Lessons from the East End\".\n\nIn 2010, Dyer wrote in \"Zoo\", in his capacity as a celebrity agony uncle, that a young male reader could get over his recent break-up with a woman by \"going on a rampage with the boys\" or to \"cut your ex's face, and then no one will want her ...\". The comment was widely criticised in the British media and by members of the public, including the chief executive of the Fawcett Society Ceri Goddard. Dyer for his own part claimed that he was misquoted.\n\nDyer was quoted in a May 2011 article in \"NME\" as wanting to headbutt film critic Mark Kermode. Kermode had criticised and impersonated Dyer on 24 May edition of his BBC Radio 5 Live show with Simon Mayo.\n\nDyer has been an outspoken critic of former Prime Minister David Cameron. In 2018, he labelled Cameron as a \"twat\", while also expressing contempt for Nigel Farage and Brexit.\n\n\n"}

A preliminary design was made in 1936 by Zbysław Ciołkosz, the main designer of the LWS factory, a detailed design - by Jerzy Teisseyre. It was influenced by RWD-9 and RWD-13 planes of the RWD team, especially their wing construction with rich wing mechanization, that gave it STOL capabilities. The prototype was built using PCK funds. Aircraft was registered SP-ATP and flown in autumn of 1937.\n\nThe Polish Red Cross ordered six aircraft, but the LWS factory was busy at that time with military production (RWD-14 Czapla and LWS-3 Mewa), and they were not built by the outbreak of World War II. LWS's next design, the LWS-3 Mewa close reconnaissance plane, utilized many features of the LWS-2, and was generally similar.\n\nMixed construction (steel and wood) braced high-wing monoplane, conventional in layout. Fuselage of a steel frame, canvas covered (engine part with duralumin). Two-spar straight wings of wooden construction, with slats, flaps and flaperons, covered with canvas and plywood (in front), rectangular with rounded tips and narrowing near the fuselage. The wings were supported with V-struts and were folding rearwards. Cantilever empennage, covered with plywood (stabilizers) and canvas (rudder and elevators). Conventional fixed landing gear, with a rear skid. Capacity of four in a closed cockpit: a pilot in front, a doctor behind him, and two lying on stretchers at the back. It had a 9-cylinder air-cooled Avia-built Wright Whirlwind J-5 radial engine delivering 220 hp (164 kW) nominal power and 240 hp (179 kW) take-off power. Two-blade metal propeller Ratier, of variable pitch. A 130-liter fuel tank behind the engine. Cruise fuel consumption 48 l/h.\n\nOn May 19, 1938 the prototype was given to the Air Force. Between July 1 and July 4, 1938, the LWS-2 prototype took part in an International Ambulance Aircraft Contest in Esch in Luxembourg, and won first place and a cup for the best accommodation in a cab for the injured.\n\nThe prototype was later used by the Polish Red Cross. Its fate during the World War II is not clear, as the damaged plane was captured by the Germans on airfield at Krosno.\n\n\n"}

Known by his nickname \"Lucho\", he won his 2 career singles titles, reached the quarterfinals of the 2004 Madrid Masters and achieved a career-high singles ranking of World No. 33 in August 2004.\n\nTogether with Pablo Cuevas, Horna also won the men's doubles at the 2008 French Open. At the 2003 French Open, he defeated Roger Federer in the first round.\n\nHorna was an outstanding junior player, reaching as high as No. 4 in the world in singles 1997 (and No. 3 in doubles). He made the final of the boys singles at the French Open in 1997 losing to Daniel Elsner. Horna won the French Open and Wimbledon doubles with José de Armas and Nicolás Massú respectively.\n\nHorna turned professional in 1998 and he moved up over 1,000 places in the rankings with victories in the Ecuadorian, where he defeated Sergio Roitman as a qualifier and three Futures events in Peru and in 1999 made his first ATP Challenger final in Aschaffenburg. In 2000 he was finalist in Salinas and again in Aschaffenburg and it was not until 2001 that Horna was able to get his first win on the ATP tour in Umag defeating Martin Damm and made another Challenger final in Curitiba losing to Flávio Saretta.\n\n2002 was a successful year for Horna when he became the first Peruvian since Jaime Yzaga to finish in the top 100 in the end of season rankings, who finished 34th in 1994. This was achieved through winning three Challenger titles in Zagreb, Fürth, and Weiden defeating Dominik Hrbatý, Jürgen Melzer and Zeljko Krajan respectively and finalist in the São Paulo Challenger losing to Franco Squillari.\n\nHorna made his debut in the four Grand Slam events in 2003. At the French Open, Horna defeated Roger Federer who was the 5th pre tournament favourite and was the last time that Federer has lost in the first round of a Grand Slam event. At the time Horna said after the victory that it was \"the best feeling I have had in my whole life\". Horna lost his second round match after having a match point against eventual finalist Martin Verkerk. He won another Challenger title in Seville and was a three time semi finalist in Amersfoort, Sopot and Palermo.\n\nIn 2004, Horna reached his career-high world ranking is no. 33, which was achieved on 30 August. Horna won the Bermuda Challenger over Martín Vassallo Argüello and made his first ATP final in Long Island losing to Lleyton Hewitt. Horna also made three semi finals at the Brasil Open, Houston and Munich. Horna finished inside the top 50 at the end of the year equalling the same feat by Jaime Yzaga.\n\n2005 was not as successful for Horna and his singles ranking slipped to outside the top 50. He won his first doubles title with Argentine Martín García in Amersfoort and achieved his best ever performance at the French Open making the third round and defeating the seeded Tim Henman in the second round before losing to Victor Hănescu.\n\nDespite Horna winning his first ever ATP singles title defeating Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina 7–6, 6–4 in Acapulco. After winning the title he said \"Acapulco will stay in my heart. I've had an unbelievable experience here,\". \"It's like being at home\". As well as reaching the third round of the Australian Open for the first time defeating Gaël Monfils before losing to Paul-Henri Mathieu and winning his second doubles title with Martín García in Palermo. Horna finished 2006 ranked outside the top 50 and had various injury problems relating to his arm and shoulder which affected his final end-of-year ranking.\n\nHorna had an unfortunate start to 2007 by losing his first round match at the Australian Open to doubles' specialist Max Mirnyi, after being frustrated by the umpire's refusal to eject an abusive heckler in the fifth set. His concentration was disturbed by the calls of \"Well done, Beast\" (Max Mirnyi's nickname) and \"C'mon, roadkill\". In February of that year he won his second ATP singles title, defeating Nicolás Massú for the only time in 7 matches 7–5, 6–3 in Viña del Mar, Chile, without losing a set in the tournament. In September, Horna and Iván Miranda took the Peruvian team of Davis Cup to the World Group for the first time by beating Belarus in Lima 4–1.\n\nWhile Horna has only made one semi final in 2008 in Acapulco, he has won 3 doubles titles in Auckland with Juan Mónaco, in Buenos Aires with Agustín Calleri and the 2008 French Open with the Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas. The 2008 Australian Open started an unusual sequence for Horna, in which he played against his sometime doubles partner and friend Agustín Calleri in his first four tournaments of the year in addition to the Australian Open, the others were Viña del Mar, Buenos Aires and Acapulco. This sequence was broken by Horna's elbow injury that caused him to withdraw from Costa do Sauipe.\n\nThe highlight of 2008 was the unexpected win in the 2008 French Open men's doubles crown, partnering Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas, the duo became the first all-South American doubles team to win a Grand Slam title. It was a surprise that Cuevas said \"We were not expecting to go that far.\" Horna and Cuevas were unseeded and defeated four seeded teams starting with Michaël Llodra and Arnaud Clément in the first round, Leander Paes and Lukáš Dlouhý in the third round. In the quarter finals they defeated the No. 1 ranked team Bob and Mike Bryan and in the final defeated the No. 2 seeded team of Nenad Zimonjić and Daniel Nestor. The trophy was presented by Andrés Gómez Horna said that \"Gomez has been like an idol for us Peruvians,\". \"To have a trophy from him is, I think, one of the important moments in my professional career.\"\n\nWhile having doubles success, Horna struggled in his singles and finished outside the top 100 since 2001. He won the Lugano Challenger without losing a set defeating Nicolas Devilder in the final.\n\nHorna and Cuevas by virtue of winning Roland Garros had qualified for the Tennis Masters Cup doubles where they made the semi finals losing to Nenad Zimonjić and Daniel Nestor, by finishing second in their round robin group behind Bob and Mike Bryan.\n\nHorna became the first player from Peru to win a Grand Slam title in the professional era. The Peruvian Alejandro Olmedo won two before the Open era, Wimbledon and Melbourne (Australian Open) in 1959 but representing the United States.\n\n2009 was Horna's last season on tour, and played his final tournament at Lima Challenger, where he lost in the second round to Chilean Jorge Aguilar.\n\nHorna plays right-handed, he has a strong serve for a relatively short player and the forehand is his best stroke.

Both girls were only interested in becoming dancers in the future and had no aspiration to become singers.\nIn 2002, Haruka and Yukari noticed a pink flier for an audition to become a \"female hip hop unit\" which was held by the group Rip Slyme. Yukari admitted that the both of them entered the competition simply to see what it was.\nAmong hundreds of entrants, Haruka and Yukari were chosen to form Halcali. The girls modestly spoke of their formation, saying that although there were many girls cuter than themselves, Rip Slyme and Oshare Toy Factory riskily chose them. Yukari stated, \"Sometimes it's like you want to have a piece of really gross gum- Just to see!\"\n\nHalcali debuted at a free concert held by Rip Slyme at the Budokan theatre. There, Halcali performed with Rip Slyme and were introduced along with their debut single, .\n\"Tandem\" was released on January 8, 2003 and was marketed on several Japanese television networks, along with MTV. The single entered into the Oricon Charts at position 19.\nThe time between the release of their first single to that of their debut album Halcali moved away from mainstream J-pop and toward a style combining pop and rap; an airy, self-parody \"bubblegum\" rap in the vein of earlier groups such as \"East End X Yuri\". This was evident in their second and third singles, and released in mid-2003. Both singles focused on rap rather than pop.\n\nThe latter song attracted attention from Western audiences when it appeared on Adam and Joe Go Tokyo.\nIn winter 2003, Halcali released their fourth single, the Christmas-themed . This single continued to show the fluctuation between rap and J-pop.\n\nAfter the release of \"Strawberry Chips\", Halcali's visual style shifted, along with the layout and lyrical style of their songs. Their fifth single, , was the first to showcase this new style. This change in style is attributed to Halcali's coming-of-age, however it also represents the changing of fads that occurred in Japanese teens at the time and was necessary to retain their fanbase.\n\nTheir sixth single, \"Baby Blue!\", was an instant cult hit. The album art and video featured the character Hanpanda, a trend by Japanese artist Nagi Noda, which has since become popular.\n\n, portrays herself to be the more mature of the pair in her PR and personal blog entries. She shows focus for performances, commentating seriously on those commenting on her in TV appearances. She has recently become more focused on fashion, and has appeared in \"Barfout\", a fashion magazine, along with Yucali.\n\nIn the past, would portray a childlike image, which gave the group's image a more school-aged look. She wore a tilted baseball cap or some other sort of head apparel as was the fad at the time. Her current image is now more adult-like.\n\nHalcali's sound has been progressively and markedly different from their period of inception- initially being focused upon peppy, high-energy beats with equally fast and furious lyrics, moving onto more creative songs which seem to weave between genres and sounds, a la 音樂ノススメ (Ongaku no Susume), and more particularly サイボーグ俺達 (Cyborg Oretachi), which included musical genres ranging from rap, pop, electrocore and rock.\n\nAs Haruka & Yukari have matured, they have taken on the role of writing their own rhymes and lyrics and composing their own music. Their third album, サイボーグ俺達 (Cyborg Oretachi), featured many tracks which were written or co-written by Halcali. Every single after this album has also been written by or co-written by Halcali as well.\n\nSeveral songs by Halcali have been used as opening or ending themes in anime television series.\n\n\n(\"* Denotes a Collaborative single as Tokyo No.1 Soul Set + Halcali\")\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The first storm of the 2005 Pacific hurricane season, Adrian developed on May 17, just two days after the official start of the season, several hundred miles south-southeast of Mexico. Tracking in an atypical northwestward direction, the storm gradually intensified. On May 19, the storm reached its peak strength as a minimal hurricane with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Not long after reaching this intensity, the storm abruptly weakened. By the morning of May 20, the system had weakened to a minimal tropical storm and turned due west. Later that day, the storm made landfall along the Gulf of Fonseca in Honduras before dissipating several hours later.\n\nHurricane Adrian originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa, near the Cape Verde Islands in early May 2005. Between May 10 and 14, several areas of disturbed weather moved across Central America, contributing to the development of a broad area of low pressure about 520 mi (835 km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. On May 15, another tropical wave interacted with the low, resulting in the consolidation of the system. The following day, the developing low was nearly stationary as convection increased. Around 11:00 am PDT (1800 UTC) on May 17, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that the system developed into a tropical depression, the first of the 2005 Pacific hurricane season. Upon forming, the depression was situated just south of 10°N, making it the 40th known tropical cyclone to do so since 1949. Unlike most storms in the eastern Pacific, Tropical Depression One-E tracked towards the northwest in response to a trough over Mexico. Tropical cyclone forecast models at the time anticipated intensification as conditions ahead of the system favored tropical cyclone development. Initially, the system moved at a slow pace of ; however this later increased to . Within six hours of being declared a depression, the cyclone was classified as Tropical Storm Adrian.\n\nOver the following days, gradual strengthening took place as Adrian moved through a region of moderate wind shear. By May 18, deep convection consolidated around the center of circulation and feeder bands developed along the periphery of the storm. Warm waters, around , ahead of the storm would allow for further strengthening despite wind shear and interaction with the high terrain of Central America. Additionally, some forecasts predicted that Adrian would survive the passage of Central America and enter the Caribbean Sea, possibly becoming the third known storm to cross from the eastern Pacific into the Atlantic basin. By May 19, the storm became relatively disorganized and Adrian only maintained a small area of convection around its center. However, within hours of this disorganization, the system rapidly consolidated and satellite imagery depicted the precursor to an eye forming. Following this, Adrian intensified to a minimal hurricane before attaining its peak intensity around 10:00 am PDT (1700 UTC) on May 19. At this time, the storm was situated about 85 mi (140 km) and had sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 982 mbar (hPa; 29 inHg).\n\nNot long after becoming a hurricane, Adrian suddenly succumbed to persistent wind shear off the coast of El Salvador. Operationally, this weakening was not noticed by the NHC, leading to their assessment of the storm making landfall in El Salvador around 11:00 pm PDT (0600 UTC on May 20) as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. In post-storm analysis, it was determined that the center of Adrian never actually crossed the coastline of El Salvador. Rather, convection associated with the system was sheared northward away from the center of circulation. Meteorologists at the NHC stated that Adrian's near-parallel track along the coast of El Salvador contributed to its rapid weakening as well as keeping the low offshore. Later on May 20, the system weakened to a tropical depression and made landfall in Honduras, along the Gulf of Fonseca, around 1:00 pm PDT (2100 UTC) with winds of 25 mph (35 km/h). Several hours later, Adrian dissipated over the mountains of Central America.\n\nIn response to the approaching hurricane, officials in El Salvador initiated the evacuations of about 3,500 families throughout 13 municipalities. Public facilities, as precautionary measures, were closed. The local governments and citizens were mindful of the damages caused to the region by other hurricanes, namely the 9,000 deaths caused by Hurricane Mitch in 1998. According to President Antonio Saca, roughly 23,000 people evacuated by the storm's arrival. In fears of significant damage, a state of emergency was declared for the entire country, home to roughly 6.5 million people.\n\nIn nearby Honduras, officials closed schools and public workers were given a half day as a precautionary measure. Small-scale evacuations also took place in parts of Guatemala and Nicaragua. Guatemala also declared a state of maximum alert as heavy rains from Adrian were expected to trigger flooding. Shelters were set up across the country to house roughly 400,000 people at-risk from the storm.\n\nAdrian had minor effects in Honduras; only a few poorly constructed building were destroyed and minor floods were reported and there were no known fatalities associated with the storm.\n\nIn El Salvador, rains from Adrian led to numerous landslides and flash floods, mainly along coastal areas. Fallen trees were reported throughout the country. The floods prompted officials to shut down roads to keep people out of harm's way. Heavy rains up to 16.4 inches (418.6 mm) caused several landslides that damaged roads. Two deaths took place, one due to a plane crash caused by strong winds, the other caused by flooding. In all, damages in El Salvador totaled to $12 million (2005 USD; $ USD).\n\nIn Guatemala, two people were killed after rains ahead of Adrian caused a ditch to cave in on them. One person was killed due to flooding in Nicaragua.\n\n\n"}

The party was established in 1997 and it is an associate member of the Party of European Socialists (PES) and is a full member of the Socialist International.\n\nAccording to its statute, the DPM pleads that Moldova is an independent, sovereign, and democratic state, based on law and integrated in the united family of European democracies.\n\nThe party was established on 8 February 1997 as the Movement for a Democratic and Prosperous Moldova (MDPM). On 17 October 1998 at the Congress, the leadership of the party was chosen and the status and political program based on the principles of social democracy was adopted. In parliamentary elections of March 1998, the electoral bloc formed on the basis of the Movement – the Bloc for a Democratic and Prosperous Moldova – won over 18% of the votes and 24 seats in Parliament respectively, which allowed it to participate in governance, within the Alliance for Democracy and Reforms (ADR). From 1997 until the summer of 2009, the party was led by Dumitru Diacov, who, within 1997–2001, held the position of Chairman of Parliament. In 1999, Ion Sturza, the MDPM representative, was appointed for the position of the Prime Minister.\nOn 15 April 2000, at the Congress of the Movement for a Democratic and Prosperous Moldova was changed its name to the Democratic Party of Moldova. In parliamentary elections of February 2001, the DPM won 79,757 votes (5.02%) but failed to overcome the 6% electoral threshold. On 25 May 2003, at the local elections, the party won over 8.3% of the votes and took good position in the country.\n\nOn 22 November 2003, at the Congress the new objectives of the party were set. One of the core document that was adopted at the Congress was the new edition of the political program, where the party declares an immutable character of its scopes and principals. At the Congress, the Democratic Party declared the intention to become a member of Socialist International and the Resolution on relationships between Democratic Party of Moldova and the trade union movement was adopted. On 8 May 2004, in respond to the voters' expectations regarding strengthening the reforming and democratic forces, the Democratic Party of Moldova, the Alliance “Our Moldova” and Social and Liberal Party (SLP) established the Democratic Moldova Block (DMB).\n\nFollowing the parliamentary elections held on 6 March 2005, the DPM won 8 seats in the parliament, being the only party which had lost the election in 2001 and came back in the parliament in 2005. In October 2007, the SLP MPs joined the DPM's parliamentary group and the number of democrats increased to 11, thus, the DPM became at that time the third political force in the Parliament.\n\nAfter merging of the PDM with the Social-Liberal Party, which took place at the Congress on 10 February 2008, Dumitru Diacov was re-elected as a chairman of the party, and former SLP leader Oleg Serebrian became the deputy chairman. The PDM's party hymn became the Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\", which symbolizes the pro-European vector of the party and its adhesion to the European federalist flow. On 19 July 2009, Marian Lupu was elected as party chairman at the Extraordinary Congress of the PDM.\n\nOn 5 April 2009 at the Parliamentary elections the Democratic Party won only 2.97% of votes, and remained out of the Parliament.\n\nIn the 29 July 2009 elections, the DPM won 13 seats, and became in a very short time one out of four components of the Alliance for European Integration (AEI) that gained the majority at the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova. Marian Lupu, the DPM's candidate, was delegated as the candidate of the Alliance for European Integration for the position of the President of the Republic of Moldova at the elections held on 10 November and 7 December 2009 but did not gain enough votes.\n\nFollowing the early parliamentary elections of 28 November 2010, the DPM won 15 seats in the Parliament and became one out of three components of the AEI -2.\n\nAt the early 2013, following the resonant case “Pădurea Domnească” (Reign Forest) the alliance fell apart. In May 2013, DPM (with 15 MPs), the Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova (31 MPs) and the Liberal Reformist Party (7 MPS) established the new governing coalition - the Pro-European Coalition.\n\nFollowing the parliamentary elections of 30 November 2014, the DPM won 15.8% and formed the pro-European governing coalition, having 19 MPs in the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova. After the elections, the DPM and LDPM (23 MPs) has established the minority governing coalition – the Political Alliance for a European Moldova.\n\nSince 2009, the Democratic Party has been a full member of the Socialist International. From 2010 until 2015, the DPM was an observer member of the Party of European Socialists and in June 2015, the PDM became an associate member of the Party of European Socialists.\n\nOn 14 January 2016, Mr. Pavel Filip, delegated by the DPM and backed by the new parliamentary majority became the new candidate for prime minister position.\n\nThe government headed by Mr. Pavel Filip was voted and appointed, with the votes of 57 members of parliament: 20 PDM's MPs, 13 LP's MPs, 14 former Communist Party's MPs, 8 LDPM's MPs and 2 former LDPM's MPs.\n\nThe VIIIth Congress was called after the decisions adopted at the meeting of the DPM's Political Council held on 10 December 2016 when the party leader, Mr. Marian Lupu, announced his resignation from the PDM's chairman position.<ref name=\"Ziarulnational.md/live-membrii-pd-s-au-reunit-la-congresul-viii-cine-este-noul-lider-al-partidului-de-guvernamant/_2018-10-19\"></ref>\nThe main task of the VIIIth Congress was the election of new leadership, adoption of new changes in the party's statute and streamlining new modernization objectives of the party. The businessman, Mr. Vlad Plahotniuc was elected for the position of the DPM chairman and he gained unanimous supportive votes of delegates at the congress. Mr. Vlad Plahotniuc said that he would focus on the modernization of the political party, to become a party that promotes citizens' interests rather than geopolitical ones.<ref name=\"Antticoruptie.md/ro/stiri/vladimir-plahotniuc-noul-presedinte-al-pd-a-venit-vremea-tuturor-celor-care-fura-sa-stea-la-puscarie_2018-10-19\"></ref> The congress delegates also elected Mr. Pavel Filip as first deputy chairman of the PDM, voted the list of the new National Political Council and adopted the new edition of the Party Statute.\n\nAccording to the organizers, about 1000 delegates from all the districts of the country and guests from abroad participated in the congress.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, the 14 former Communist MPs who formed SDPM \"Social Democratic Platform for Moldova\" joined the parliamentary faction of the Democratic Party of Moldova.<ref name=\"Jurnal.md/ro/politic/2017/3/10/si-au-oficializat-relatia-cei-14-deputati-transfugi-care-au-parasit-pcrm-si-au-votat-pentru-guvernul-filip-se-alatura-fractiunii-pd/_2018-10-19\"></ref> Democratic faction leader, Mr. Marian Lupu said at the press briefing that the decision of the 14 MPS “is a step that will lead to the strengthening of the parliamentary majority”, thus, the DPM become largest political group in the Parliament.\n\nIn the 2019 parliamentary election, the DPM received 23.6% of the vote, gaining 30 seats in parliament, making it the second largest party in Moldova.\n\nThe party moved into opposition to the new Sandu Cabinet (formed by PSRM, PAS and DA). However, in November 2019 Sandu was removed by the Parliament of Moldova through a motion of no confidence and PD and PSRM formed a new coalition government.\n\nThe DPM's doctrine is based on the principles of social democracy. It has the following core values: Equality, so that all individuals can realize their potential on fair terms; Solidarity, so that all people have everything they need for a decent standard of living; and Freedom, so that each individual can build his/her own personal life project.\n\nThe logo of the Democratic Party of Moldova is composed of three roses growing from a stem, crowned with a semicircle.\n\nThe DPM's National Political Council is the governing body of the party during the period between two congresses. The meeting of the National Political Council is convened at least twice a year by the Chairman of the DPM or at the request of at least 1/3 of the members of the National Political Council. The DPM's National Political Council is elected by the Congress for a term of four years, the numerical composition being determined by the DPM's Congress decision. The Political Council is representative of the members of all the districts of the country, which ensures the PDM members' decision-making power is valued and respected.\nThe DPM's Executive Board is the decision-making executive body of the DPM, which coordinates the activity of the latter during the period between meetings of the National Political Council. The Executive Board is elected for a term of four and composed of 31 members.\nThe Permanent Bureau is the body that carries out an operational analysis and synthesis of the activity of the party during the period between meetings of the National Political Council and the Executive Board and is convened weekly or when necessary, at the request of Chairman of the DPM. The Permanent Bureau of the DPM brings together the Chairman, First Deputy Chairman, Honorary Chairman, Deputy-Chairmen and Secretary General of the DPM. This leadership is mandated by party members to analyze and decide on the day-to-day political activities of the DPM.\n\nThe DPM includes Women Organization, Democratic Youth, \"Treasure of the Nation\" Elderly People Organization, and local elected officials. The Women Organization is the most powerful, active and representative party organization of women in Moldova.\n\nThe number of the party members: ~ 54,200 (07/2018)\n\n\nThe DPM aims to achieve the following political objectives, according to its core values and the needs of sustainable development of the Republic of Moldova:\n\n1. Consolidation of the constitutional order in the state, guaranteeing respect for political, economic and social human rights in line with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and other international legal instruments;\n\n2.

He was elected to the Pennsylvania Colonial Assembly, serving from 1756 to 1760, but then declined further service.\n\nWhen war neared, he joined the Associators (as the Pennsylvania rebel militia was known), and was made colonel of his regiment. In May 1776 he presided at several public meetings calling for the existing Pennsylvania delegation to the Continental Congress to be replaced with members who supported a Declaration of Independence. As a result, he was named to the Committee of Safety, and on July 4, 1776 was named a brigadier general in the state militia.\n\nRoberdeau was first elected to the Continental Congress in February 1777 and served there until 1779. Later that year, when the Continental Army entered winter quarters at Valley Forge, he worked with General Washington to set up a militia support network known as the Flying Camp, and served as its commander.\n\nIn April 1778, Roberdeau took a short leave from Congress. He had noted the shortage of powder and shot in the army, and used the time off to establish a lead mine in Bedford County. To protect the mine and camp from Indian attacks, he built a palisade, Fort Roberdeau, at his own expense. Historically, Roberdeau's fort was known as the \"Lead Mine Fort\". It has been reconstructed near its original site in Sinking Valley, near present-day Altoona, Blair County, Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter the war he moved to Alexandria, Virginia, and eventually settled in Winchester, where he died in 1795. He is buried in the Mt. Hebron Cemetery there. His son, Isaac Roberdeau, became a civil engineer and U.S. Army officer, who helped Pierre L'Enfant lay out the plan for Washington, D.C..\n\n"}

{"id": "1910482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910482", "title": "Amy Gutmann", "text": "Amy Gutmann\n\nAmy Gutmann (born 1949) is the eighth president of the University of Pennsylvania. In November 2016, the school announced that her contract had been extended to 2022 which will make her the longest-serving president in the history of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2018, \"Fortune\" magazine named Gutmann one of the \"World's 50 Greatest Leaders\". Her professional biography includes more than two decades at Princeton including as that university's provost and Laurance S. Rockefeller University Professor of Politics. While there, she founded Princeton's ethics center, the University Center for Human Values. Her published works span the fields of politics, ethics, education, and philosophy. \n\nShe was born on November 19, 1949, in Brooklyn, New York, the only child of Kurt and Beatrice Gutmann. She was raised in Monroe, New York, a small town outside New York City.\n\nHer father was the youngest of five children in an Orthodox Jewish family in Feuchtwangen, Germany. He was living near Nuremberg, Germany, when Adolf Hitler ascended to power. He fled Nazi Germany in 1934 as a college student. After being denied asylum in the US, he brought his entire family, including four siblings, to join him in Bombay, India, where he founded a metal fabricating factory. Kurt Gutmann was still living in India in 1948 when he came to New York City for vacation. While there he attended a benefit at a Manhattan hotel, Essex House, where he met Beatrice, Amy's future mother, and the two were married weeks later.\nGutmann told Adam Bryant of \"The New York Times\" in June 2011:\n\nGutmann graduated from Monroe-Woodbury High School in Monroe, New York. She then entered Radcliffe College of Harvard University in 1967 on a scholarship as a math major with sophomore standing. She received membership in Phi Beta Kappa and her Bachelor of Arts degree \"magna cum laude\" from Radcliffe College in 1971, followed by a Master of Science degree in political science from the London School of Economics in 1972, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in political science from Harvard University in 1976. She is the first in her family to graduate from college.\n\nGutmann taught at Princeton University from 1976 to 2004. In 1990, she became the first Laurance S. Rockefeller University Professor at Princeton and the founding director of its University Center for Human Values, among the first and best-endowed university-wide multi-disciplinary ethics centers in the world. As provost at Princeton University from 2001 to 2004, she oversaw Princeton's plan to expand the undergraduate student body by 10 percent and spearheaded the recruitment from Harvard of star professor K. Anthony Appiah (co-author with Gutmann of \"Color Conscious: The Political Morality of Race\").\n\nIn her 2004 inaugural address Gutmann launched the Penn Compact, her vision for making Penn both a global leader in teaching, research, and professional practice; and a dynamic agent of social, economic, and civic progress.\n\nIn 2017 she renewed and updated her vision with the Penn Compact 2022, recommitting the university to these ideals and outlining the next steps: First, to increase inclusion at the University with increases in faculty and student diversity. Second, to integrate knowledge across academic disciplines with a strong emphasis on innovation: Penn was named No. 4 in Reuters' Top 100 World Innovative Universities in 2017, 2018, and 2019. A third priority through the Compact is to have an impact locally, nationally, and globally to bring the benefits of Penn's research, teaching, and service to individuals and communities at home and around the world, most recently illustrated by one of Penn's biomedical research and clinical breakthroughs, approved by the FDA to treat cancer using a patient's own immune system. \"The Wall Street Journal\" also noted that \"Today the university [Penn] lays claim to having incubated the world's biggest cancer breakthrough.\"\n\nAs president, Gutmann has overseen Penn's largest fundraising campaign ever, Making History. Launched in 2007, the Making History Campaign raised a record $4.3 billion, exceeding its goal by more than $800 million. It achieved its $3.5-billion target 16 months ahead of its December 31, 2012, conclusion. It was an unusually broad-based campaign, attracting gifts from nearly 327,000 donors. Gutmann is the only Penn president to lead two fundraising campaigns: the second, Power of Penn, was launched in March 2018 with a goal of $4.1 billion and priorities including a \"Penn First Plus\" initiative, targeted to support first-generation, low-income students. \n\nGutmann has been a leading national advocate for financial aid based on need to promote socioeconomic diversity in higher education. Gutmann made Penn one of the handful of universities in the country that substitute grants for loans for any undergraduate student with financial need. In September 2009, for the first time in Penn's history, all undergraduates eligible for financial aid received grants rather than loans in their aid packages. Students from typical families with income less than $40,000 paid no tuition, fees, room or board. Students from typical families with incomes less than $90,000 paid no tuition and fees. In 2017, one out of eight incoming Penn students were the first in their families to attend college, up from one out of 20 in 2004. She and her husband Michael Doyle have also funded an endowed undergraduate scholarship and an undergraduate research fund at Penn. In 2017, they committed an additional more than $1 million for scholarships, supporting multiple students and matching funds for other donors. \n\nIn 2014, Gutmann announced Penn Compact 2020 initiatives to create up to 50 new endowed professorships utilizing matching donor funds, and to raise an additional $240 million for undergraduate financial aid on top of the $360 million raised for undergraduate aid during the recently completed Making History campaign. Additionally, Gutmann announced unique and unprecedented awards for undergraduate students \"with the most promising plans to improve local, national, or global conditions in the year after their graduation\".\n\nIn March 2015, Gutmann announced the selection of five students (four projects) as winners of Penn's inaugural President's Engagement Prize. The largest of their kind in higher education, the President's Engagement Prizes provide up to $150,000 annually for graduating seniors to design and implement impactful local, national, and global engagement projects. In its coverage of the first awards, \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" stated, \"Penn grads win chance to change the world.\" In October 2015, she announced Penn's President's Innovation Prize, a corollary to the Engagement Prize that is focused on commercial ventures; the first winners were announced in April 2016. Shadrack Frimpong, a 2015 alumnus, used his President's Engagement Prize to start a school for girls, many of whom did not have access to education. Frimpong returned to Penn in 2018 to complete a degree in non-profit leadership and management at Penn to continue his work.\n\nSince arriving at Penn, Gutmann has also spearheaded a major campus development plan, Penn Connects, that includes that Penn purchased from the US Postal Service along the Schuylkill River, which opened as Penn Park in September 2011. Penn Connects is designed to boost the economic, educational and social capacity of Philadelphia and to create seamless gateways between West Philadelphia and Center City across the Schuylkill River.\n\nPenn began an expansion east of the Schuylkill River with the purchase of the DuPont Marshall Laboratory in September 2010. Gutmann said that the Marshall Lab property has \"infinite possibilities\" as a place to nurture startups and \"technology transfer\", where faculty with \"great discoveries can attract venture capital\" and bring ideas to market.\n\nIn Fall 2016, Penn opened its Pennovation Center, the anchor of a 23-acre site that the university has dubbed Pennovation Works, on a Grays Ferry site along the south bank of the Schuylkill which was once home to the DuPont Co.'s Marshall Labs (where workers discovered the substance that led to the development of Teflon). The $35-million project is about 1 1/2 miles from the center of Penn's West Philadelphia campus. A large, red-letter sign reads \"Pennovation\" over the three-story, 58,000-square foot facility. Pennovation includes an addition that resembles a crystal formation, representing the \"crystallization of ideas\", and architecture critic Inga Saffron says that its unique design \"announces the future\", rather than harkening back to the past. Johnson & Johnson announced in July 2018 that Pennovation Works would house J&J's first US-based JPOD, a networking hub that seeks to connect J&J researchers and the local life sciences community. With the announcement, J&J joined the ranks of global telecom giant Qualcomm and chocolate maker Hershey's, which also selected Pennovation Works to open Philadelphia operations. \n\nOn December 8, 2014, \"The Daily Pennsylvanian\" reported that student protesters concerned about the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, disrupted a holiday party for students at Gutmann's home. As a gesture of support for the students' cause, Gutmann joined them in lying on the ground to symbolize the four-and-a-half hours that Brown's body was left lying on the street in Ferguson after his death. Members of the Penn police force publicly responded to the show of support, with the head of the police union writing a public letter criticizing the move and the chief of the police department responding with a letter defending Gutmann's actions.\n\nOn May 8, 2012, Penn announced that Gutmann's contract had been renewed through 2019. In announcing the extension, David L. Cohen, chair of Penn's Board of Trustees, stated that Penn's \"Trustees feel very strongly that Amy Gutmann is simply the best university president in the country. Under her superb leadership, Penn is a stronger and more vibrant institution than at any time in its storied history.\" In November 2016 Cohen, still Board Chairman, announced that Gutmann's contract would be extended until 2022, making her the longest-serving president ever at Penn.\n\nIn 2017, Gutmann's total compensation was $2.9 million, making her the highest paid private college president in Pennsylvania and fourth highest in the United States.\n\nThrough her writings, Gutmann has consistently sought to bridge theory and policy to advance the core values of a civil democratic society: liberty, opportunity and mutual respect. In a recent ranking of US political scientists in PhD-granting departments, she is ranked second-highest in citations among all political theorists, eighth-highest among all women political scientists, and has been cited more than any other political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. \n\nHer first major contribution to political philosophy was her book \"Democratic Education\" (1987; revised 1999). The book addresses the central questions in the political theory of education: How should a democratic society make decisions about education? What should children be taught? How should citizens be educated? It was reviewed in \"Ethics\" as \"the finest contribution to the literature on democratic education of the last seventy years\" and fostered a revival of interest in the relationship between democracy and education. The book also takes on some contemporary scholarly debates: What is the appropriate response of democratic education to the challenge of multiculturalism? Should schools try to cultivate patriotic or cosmopolitan sentiments among students?\n\nGutmann's second major contribution to political philosophy is a theory of deliberative democracy that she developed in collaboration with Harvard political scientist Dennis Thompson. \"Democracy and Disagreement\" (1996) calls for more reasoned and respectful argument in everyday politics. Deliberation can inform decision making through reasoned argument and develop society's collective capacity to pursue justice while finding mutually acceptable terms of social cooperation—even when disagreements persist.\n\n\"Democracy and Disagreement\" has been praised as an effective remedy for polarized politics and criticized as impractical, as evidenced in a collection of pro and con essays published in \"Deliberative Politics\", edited by Stephen Macedo. Defenders argue that more and better political deliberation can help all citizens. In her work Gutmann has applied the ideas of deliberative democracy to the US electoral process, President Barack Obama's Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and healthcare organization in the United Kingdom.\n\nGutmann's third major contribution to political philosophy is her analysis of group identity and its intersection with justice. In \"Identity in Democracy\" (2003), Gutmann argues that identity groups as such are neither friends nor enemies of democratic justice. She analyzes the legitimate but also problematic parts played by group identity in democratic politics and draws distinctions among the various types of identity group politics. She further developed this perspective in her nationally recognized 2018 Penn Commencement speech, \"Think Uniquely, Stand United,\" in which she said that \". . . what makes us unique and what unites us are not starkly opposed. Uniqueness and unity are the twin pillars of a strong pluralism. We thrive when we combine unity of shared values with our unique perspectives on life. It has never been more important that we think uniquely while we stand united.\" \n\nIn May 2012, Gutmann published her 16th book, \"The Spirit of Compromise: Why Governing Demands It and Campaigning Undermines It\" (Princeton University Press), with co-author Dennis Thompson of Harvard. The authors posit that the difficulty of compromise is built into the democratic process itself, but so is the need for it. A better understanding and appreciation of compromise might be especially useful in this time of political polarization. Paul Starr of \"The New Republic\" said \"The Spirit\":\n\nProvide[s] grist for thinking through the difficulties of compromise in [domestic policy], from tragic choices at desperate moments of history to the routine nastiness in American public life today... Until recently, who would have thought it necessary to offer Americans advice in the ways of compromise? We used to enjoy a reputation for being a practical-minded people, our politicians being regarded as an all-too-flexible species. But something has changed, and according to Gutmann and Thompson, the change has to do with the relation of campaigning and governing... Gutmann and Thompson end their book with recommendations to strengthen the spirit and practice of compromise.\"\n\nJudy Woodruff of the PBS Newshour called the book \"a clear-eyed examination of the forces that bring warring political leaders together or keep them apart. I wish every policymaker would read it\".\n\nGutmann's 17th book, co-authored with Jonathan Moreno, \"Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven, but Nobody Wants to Die\", was published in 2019 by W.W. Norton.\n\nGutmann serves on the board of The Vanguard Group since 2006, and has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Berggruen Institute since 2014. In addition, she is a member of the American Talent Initiative, which works to collaboratively increase access to higher education for highly talented, low-income students. \n\nIn 2009, Barack Obama appointed Gutmann chair of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, and reappointed her in early 2012. With a notably diverse membership—including experts from philosophy, medicine, nursing, law, religion, and engineering—the Bioethics Commission has issued ten reports on a wide range of challenging issues including protections for adult and pediatric participants in medical research, and the ethics of genomics and neuroscience. The commission championed an open and deliberative approach—its nationwide meetings all are open to the public and streamed live on the internet—and all its recommendations to the president were unanimous. Its capstone report, \"Bioethics for Every Generation\", focused on the increasingly important mission of bioethics commissions in advancing both democratic deliberation and bioethics education.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2009, Gutmann served on the National Security Higher Education Advisory Board, a committee that advises the FBI on national security issues relating to academia. From 2011 to 2013 she was a member of the National Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences, which was convened by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2014, the Association of American Universities elected Gutmann as chair of its board of directors for a one-year term. As AAU chair, Gutmann served as a spokesperson for the association, particularly on issues of special concern to research universities. From 2007 to 2019 Gutmann served on the Board of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, a museum dedicated to the US Constitution. She was a member of the Knight Commission on Trust, Media and Democracy from 2017 to 2019.\n\nGutmann is a member of the Global University Leaders Forum (GULF), which convenes at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. She was also among the leaders of a select group of presidents of research universities throughout the world that advised the United Nations Secretary-General on a range of global issues, including academic freedom, mass migration, international development, and the social responsibilities of universities, call the Global Colloquium of University Presidents. \n\nGutmann is married to Michael Doyle, professor of law and international affairs at Columbia University. They have one daughter, Abigail Doyle, the A. Barton Hepburn Professor of Chemistry at Princeton University.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1910488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910488", "title": "Samskara (Indian philosophy)", "text": "Samskara (Indian philosophy)\n\nIn Indian philosophy and Indian religions, samskaras or sanskaras (Sanskrit: संस्कार) are mental impressions, recollections, or psychological imprints. In Hindu philosophies, \"samskaras\" are a basis for the development of karma theory. In Buddhism the Sanskrit term Samskara is used to describe 'formations'. In Pali it is referred to as Saṅkhāra.\n\nAccording to various schools of Indian philosophy, every action, intent or preparation by an individual leaves a \"samskara\" (impression, impact, imprint) in the deeper structure of the person's mind. These impressions then await volitional fruition in that individual's future, in the form of hidden expectations, circumstances or a subconscious sense of self-worth. These \"Samskaras\" manifest as tendencies, karmic impulses, subliminal impressions, habitual potencies or innate dispositions. In ancient Indian texts, the theory of \"Samskara\" explains how and why human beings remember things, and the effect that memories have on people's suffering, happiness and contentment.\n\nThe Sanskrit word \"saṃskāra\" (संस्कार) has various context-driven meanings that broadly refer to \"the putting together, accomplishing well, making perfect, a form of solemn recognition and getting ready\" and \"mental impression, recollection\". The first context is at the etymological foundation of Sanskara term for rites of passage, while it is the second context, as a form of disposition, impression or behavioral inclination, that is at the etymological root of Sanskara word as a psychological concept in Indian philosophies.\n\nThe concept of Samskara is also discussed as \"Vasana\" (Sanskrit: वासना vāsanā), particularly in the Vaiśeṣika school of Hinduism. \"Vasana\" also means \"impression, inclination of anything remaining unconsciously in the mind\".\n\n\"Samskara\", or \"Sankhara,\" is a significant concept across major schools of Hindu philosophy as well as Buddhism and Jainism. The schools of Indian philosophy differ on the specific mechanisms about how \"samskara\" operates at the subconscious level. For example, Buddhism considers \"samskara\" as \"causal continua\" while being consistent with its \"there is no self, no soul\" premise, whereas the Vedic traditions within Hinduism consider \"samskara\" as \"relational properties\" (an impression, mark, impulse, tendency or a form of psychological potential energy within) that rests inside the \"self, soul\" of every person. In Yoga, Vedanta and Nyaya schools of Hinduism, \"samskara\" constitute an affective and motivational field that contributes to the value structure within the person. They subconsciously or consciously endorse the basic inner drives that propel a human being in future action, future premises, future thoughts or future judgments.\n\nDas states that the \"Samskara rites of passage\" is a subset of actions in a human being's life, where going through the rite within the traditions of Hinduism, affects the individual internally as well as externally in how society perceives the person. This occurs in the form of impressions and imprint within, that is \"samskara\".\n\nThe Hindu schools differ in the details, but all posit that \"samskara\" are formed in every individual by a number of ways. This includes perceptions (what one sees, hears, touches, tastes, smells), \"chitta\" cognition (what one feels and thinks), willful actions, and also intentions before and during the action. Training and study, in these schools, is a form of exposition, introspective realization and in many cases practice or repetition to make the \"impression, imprint\" part of one's nature, where the practice reinforces the dispositions (\"samskara\") and dispositions reinforce the practice, in a circular feedback. Scholars state that David Hume's \"impressions\" theory is similar to Samskara theory of Hinduism. The Hindu schools rely on \"samskara\" theory as one of the pillars for their epistemology (\"pramana\"), wherein they explain how and why man knows anything, remembers anything, expects anything, feels fulfillment, feels frustration, feels freedom and joy, or feels suffering and pain. \"Samskara\" are the impressions and dispositions that develop and accumulate deep inside a person, according to these schools, from perception, inference, choices, preparation, practice, interaction with others, thoughts, intent, willful actions and such karma. These manifest, state Hindu philosophies, as habits, behavior, tendencies, psychological predispositions and dispositions.\n\nActions, studies, diligent preparation and inner resolutions trigger Samskaras – hidden impressions or dispositions – in the psyche of an individual, and these influence how the individual acts, perceives self and the manner in which the individual responds or accepts the karmic circumstances and the future. Ian Whicher explains that, in the philosophical theories of Hinduism, every karma (action, intent) leaves a \"smnskara\" (impression, impact, imprint) in the deeper structure of human mind. This impression then awaits volitional fruition, in the form of hidden expectations, circumstances or unconscious sense of self-worth. It manifests as tendency, karmic impulse, subliminal impression, habitual potency or innate dispositions.\n\nIn Samkhya and Yoga schools, Sankhara, also spelled as Samskara, are impressions or residues that affect an individual's Gunas (behavior attributes). These impressions constitute part of the mechanistic foundation behind ancient Indian scholars' explanation on how karma theory works in practice. Samskara are explained as dispositions, character or behavioral traits either as default from birth or Samskara are behavioral traits perfected over time through Yoga, through conscious shaping of inner self, one's desire, sense of moral responsibility and through practice.\n\nIn Yoga school of Hinduism, all actions and intents lead to impressions and memories, whether they are active or hidden, conscious or unconscious. A person may not remember his or her past karma, yet the impressions shape his character, the habits, the circumstances, the essence of that person because of the impressions left by the karma. These tendencies, subtle traces and innate characteristics, states the Yoga school, continue to affect the person's present actions, assumptions, attitudes (\"bhava\"), mind (\"buddhi\"), moral response and interactions with everyone, everything and self. Vyasa, Patanjali and other ancient Indian scholars refer to these as karmic residues (\"karmasaya\"). Personality, states Patanjali, is the sum total combination of all these impressions and subtle traces (\"samskaras\"). Individuals tend to do what they did in past, man forms habit and oft returns to those habits, and behaviors tend to repeat because of these \"samskaras\", according to these Yoga scholars.\n\nThese are viewed as traces or temperament that evolves through the refinement of an individual inner consciousness and expressed personality, and is a form of \"being-preparedness\" in Vedantic psychology. All physical, verbal and mental activity, according to the Vedanta school of Hinduism, creates \"Samskara\", or traces inside a person. These \"Samskaras\" together then manifest as inner personality and external circumstances, and depending then on individual's response thereof, these then bear \"phala\" (fruit). In the state where an individual realizes Self and reaches \"jivanmukti\" (moksha), Shankara, Mandana, Sarvajnatman and other Vedanta scholars suggest that the causes of impressions such as ignorance disappear, the individual reaches inner resolution and complete acceptance of self, thus becoming free of samskaras and consequent blissful state of existence.\n\nIn Nyaya school of Hinduism, \"Bhavana\" (Sanskrit: भावना) is synonymous with \"Samskara\", a property that manifests as impressions or traces on the soul. It is a key concept in Nyaya philosophy, and it applies the idea to both living and non-living world. For example, the \"vega\" (velocity) of \"vayu\" (wind) is its samskara, in Nyaya literature. The concept is intimately related to Nyaya's search and reason-driven explanation of causes behind what happens in living and non-living world, and why. All voluntary actions, state Nyayayikas, have a cause, and these are guided by Samskara. For example, a newborn child voluntarily and instinctively acts to reach for the mother's breast. This action, explain Nyaya texts, must have a cause, but the newborn has neither been provided that knowledge nor has the value of the mother's breast been explained by another, nor has the newborn formed any Samskara in the new life. The newborn has that knowledge, that instinct, from some impression, some trace within \"from a prior experience\". That is an example of \"Samskara\", assert the Nyaya and Vaiśeṣika scholars.\n\nIn Nyaya school of Hinduism, the existence of Samskara cannot be directly perceived, only inferred. Further, not all Samskara are psychological. Some simply manifest as memories, premises or beliefs shaped \"from a prior experience\".\n\nSaṃskāra or Saṅkhāra in Buddhism refers to mental \"dispositions\". These result from past volitions, and are causes of future volitions. \"Saṅkhāra\" also refers to that faculty within a person wherein these dispositions are formed. Buddhism emphasizes the need to purify dispositions (\"Saṅkhāra\") rather than eliminate them.\n\nThe activities of mind, speech and body, according to Jain philosophy, lead to Asrava, that is, the influx and imprint of karmic residues to the \"jiva\" (soul) of the living being. These residues bind (\"bandha\"), forming \"karma sarira\", which can be stopped (\"saṃvara\") and released (\"nirjara\"). The operating mechanism, consistent with the dualism premise of Jainism, is not Saṃskāra as latent mental trace, rather \"karma bandha\" to the soul. The rituals and rites of passage, called Samskara in Jainism, are part of the \"saṃvara\" and \"nirjara\" initiation process, in order to free the soul from the crust of karmic residues.\n\n\n"}

New Rock 107 staff included Steve Williams-OM/AM Drive, Program Director Joel Sampson-PM Drive, Music Director LaLaine-PM Drive and Suzy Boe-Evenings among others.\n\nIn 1996, the station was purchased by Southern Broadcasting, which owned New Rock 107's only competition, WTKX, \"TK101\". Two months later, both were purchased by Paxson Communications. After the Paxson purchase, TK101, being a heritage rock station since the mid-1970s, brought over WOWW's PD Joel Sampson, retained Midday personality Mark \"the Shark\" Dyba and added a majority of WOWW air staff and re-imaged itself as \"The Rock Station\", dropping the moniker \"The New Rock Alternative\", leaving WOWW without an airstaff or a format.\n\nAfter stunting for two days playing \"Macarena\" non-stop, WOWW changed formats to oldies from the 1950s and 1960s, and changed its call letters to WYCL (think \"Way Cool\"). As time went on, they phased out the 1950s music to include more 1970s songs.\nThen in late 2004, the station's owner, now iHeartMedia, Inc. (formerly Clear Channel Communications), switched the music format to \"My 107.3\" and played 1970s and 1980s music. However, the \"My 70s, My 80s\" positioner was discontinued and the station used \"My Variety\" as its main positioner, in order to include a slightly wider variety of music. The playlist remained mostly 1970s and early 1980s, with a fair amount of 1960s and other 1980s songs, making it a basic classic hits format.\n\nFor three years after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the station played breaking news bulletins every hour on top of the hour (first provided by ABC News, then by Clear Channel Worldwide News), as well as \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the start and close of each workday.\nIn February 2010, the station ceased the \"My 107.3\" format and started airing the format of their sister station, \"Lite Mix 99.9\". On February 26, 2010, at 8:00 a.m. WYCL launched a new rhythmic adult contemporary format branded as \"107.3 The Groove\". The first song on The Groove was \"Into the Groove\" by Madonna. On March 5, 2010, WYCL changed their call letters to WRGV to go with \"The Groove\" branding. After a year as a Rhythmic AC, WRGV evolved to Rhythmic Top 40 in April 2011. On September 2, 2011 WRGV changed their format to Top 40 (CHR), branded as \"107.3 Hit Music Now\". It features the syndicated Elvis Duran Morning Show and former WABB staffers Reid and Matt McCoy. On July 20, 2015 WRGV rebranded as \"107.3 Kiss FM\".\n\nOn December 8, 2017 at 5 PM, after playing \"1-800-273-8255\" by Logic, 107.3 adopted W262BL/WMXC-HD2's urban contemporary format as \"107.3 The Beat\". The first song on The Beat was \"Love\" by Kendrick Lamar.\n\n"}
{"id": "1910498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910498", "title": "Personal injury protection", "text": "Personal injury protection\n\nPersonal injury protection (PIP) is an extension of car insurance available in some U.S. states that covers medical expenses and, in some cases, lost wages and other damages. PIP is sometimes referred to as \"no-fault\" coverage, because the statutes enacting it are generally known as no-fault laws, and PIP is designed to be paid without regard to \"fault,\" or more properly, legal liability. That is, even if the person seeking PIP coverage caused the accident, they are entitled to make a claim under the PIP portion of their policy. \"No-Fault\" does not mean that insurance premium of the person making the claim will not increase. Typically a PIP claim is made by the insured driver to their own insurance company, however, there are several exceptions that allow persons who have been injured in an accident to make a PIP claim if they do not own a vehicle. The particular state law and policy language of the insurer should be reviewed to see what exceptions exist in that state.\n\nPIP is a mandatory coverage in some states. PIP coverage may vary from state to state in terms of both what is covered and what types of treatments are considered medically necessary and reasonable. For example, in Utah, acupuncture is a permissible medical treatment, while in California it is not. In Texas, PIP coverage will cover medical expenses, eighty percent of lost wages, and someone to take care of the injured party. PIP insurance is mandatory in the state of Florida because it is considered a No-Fault/PIP state, this means that no matter who's at fault of the accident or if no one is declared ‘at fault’ a drivers PIP insurance is the primary provider of insurance coverage and pays a portion of medical care and treatment. Some states also allow for PIP claims even if a workers' compensation claim exists, while others do not. Some states PIP is the insurance of first resort to pay for medical bills when injured in an automobile accident.\n\nIn some states, PIP is subrogatable, meaning that your insurance carrier will pay for your loss, regardless of liability, and then recover (or subrogate) what it paid from the liable party's insurance carrier. This generally leaves the claimant/insured in a much better financial position, because his or her medical bills are paid, and the insurance carriers get to fight it out on their own, and after the fact.\n\nPIP can cover, within the specified dollar and time limits, the medical and funeral expenses of the insured, others in its vehicle at the time of the loss, and any first party if struck as a pedestrian by any vehicle. The basic coverage is for the insured's own injuries, on a first-party basis, without regard to liability. Again, it is only available in certain states. A pedestrian struck by a vehicle is covered under that vehicles liability.\n\nMany states that do not have PIP have auto medical payments (AMP) coverage, and some states have both. AMP is also a first-party coverage, without regard to liability, but is only subrogable in a few states, and generally optional.\n\nAMP and PIP limits range from $1,500 to $250,000 depending on the injury and the state, though many insurance providers have a relatively low limit of $5,000. A Michigan no-fault policy provides unlimited medical and rehabilitation benefits.) Claimants involved in an auto accident are wise to submit their own insurance information to their medical providers, as third party carriers are under no legal obligation to pay a claimant's medical bills, while first party carriers are.\n\nThird party carriers are subject to payment only after a judgment against them, and any payments prior to that are considered voluntary. Settling a claim with a third party carrier is considered a voluntary payment.\n\n\n\nCertain states require insurance companies to offer PIP coverage, but allow the insured to reject it in writing: \n\nPersonal injury protection could also refer to personal injury insurance or coverage, which is insurance in any context which includes coverage for personal injury, particularly coverage for emotional distress (typically negligent infliction of emotional distress rather than intentional infliction of emotional distress), libel, or defamation as opposed to coverage for only bodily injury. Home insurance typically includes coverage for liability arising from bodily injury, especially on an insureds' premises, but not from liability arising from mental injury. Coverage from mental injury can be included and is typically called \"personal injury\" coverage.\n"}
{"id": "1910512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910512", "title": "Tranent", "text": "Tranent\n\nTranent is a town in East Lothian (formerly Haddingtonshire), in the south-east of Scotland. It is near the A1 road, 2 miles (3 km) southeast of Prestonpans and about east of Edinburgh. It is one of the oldest towns in East Lothian, and built on a gentle slope, about above sea level. The population of the town is approximately 12,582, an increase of over 4,000 since 2001, making it the second most populated town in East Lothian after Musselburgh. Tranent was formerly a major mining town, but now serves as a commuter town for Edinburgh. \nThe name is thought to be of Brythonic origin, possibly containing the elements \"Tre\" and \"Nant\", meaning town over the stream Travernant.\n\nTranent was once an important mining town, and coal was first worked there in the thirteenth century by the monks of Newbattle Abbey who mined a nearby 2.5m / 7 ft thick coal deposit called the 'Great Seam'. The history of coal mining in Scotland is mirrored in the history of the coal heughs, mines and pits of Tranent. Tranent is now a commuter town supporting the south east of Scotland and, more specifically, Edinburgh.\n\nThe Massacre of Tranent took place in 1797, when local people were killed by soldiers after protesting against conscription into the British Army. One of the 12 victims, Jackie Crookston, is depicted on the memorial that commemorates the dead in Tranent's Civic Square.\n\nIn connection with the annual commemoration of the Battle of Prestonpans (originally called the Battle of Gladsmuir, and then renamed the Battle of Tranent, before many decades later being renamed the Battle of Prestonpans) there are plans to recreate a small portion of the Tranent to Cockenzie Waggonway which dates back to 1722.\n\nThere is a long history of settlement in Tranent, perhaps dating back to prehistory. There are several historic buildings in and around the town, including the ruins of the old parish church, parts of which date from the 11th century and which was demolished in 1797, while a few miles south-west of the town stands Fa'side Castle, sometimes known as Falside or Fawside, a fourteenth-century L-shaped tower house.\n\nIsabella Begg nee Burns, the youngest sister of Robert Burns, moved to Tranent from Ormiston with her family after her son William resigned his post as the schoolmaster. She supported her family with the help of her daughters Agnes and Isabella, working as dressmakers. In 1843 she moved to Bridge House in Alloway, South Ayrshire.\n\nCoal was first mined in Tranent Parish when Robert de Quincy granted rights in the early-thirteenth century to the monks of Newbattle to mine at Prestoungrange, which was then part of that parish. Soon many wealthy families in the parish joined the rush to mine coal. Heughs (surface mines), were being cut throughout the area. Longniddry, St. Germains, Fa'side, Ormiston (much later town) and Elphinstone, all parts of old Tranent, had their own collieries and for the next 750 years the industry prospered. Other industries grew to employ increasing populations: distilleries, breweries, tanneries and metal implement works. Quarries opened providing stone for homes. Farming was modernised and mills opened to provide food. The nineteenth century saw a slowdown in industrial growth and, gradually, industry centralised and moved to larger centres. The coal industry had peaked and the twentieth century brought about a slow, but terminal decline. The last large deep mine closed in 1961, then in 2000 the opencast mine at Blindwells closed.\n\nWilliam Dunbar's poem the \"Lament for the Makaris\" includes the name \"Clerk of Tranent\" as a poet, probably of the fifteenth century, citing him as an author of the \"Anteris\" \"of Gawain\". Some examples of such works exist but his has not been traced.\n\nTranent is the birthplace of Lizzie in Lucy Booth's novel 'The Life of Death', a chilling love story in which Lizzie/Death enters a pact with the devil to regain her life, live and love.\n\nSince 1934 Tranent has held a Gala Week which is arranged by local volunteers who are part of the Gala Committee. Events during the gala week include the crowning of the Queen who is accompanied by 29 other children from the town, the celebrations on the fields at Ross High School and the grand parade which is made up of local groups and people and which goes through the town. Tranent Gala is funded by donations and fundraising.\n\nThe Gala was first formed in 1934 by the miners of Tranent who aimed to form a special event for people in the town.\n\nThe town has two supermarkets. On the east of the town's High Street, there is an Asda supermarket which opened in August 2015. There is also an Aldi supermarket on the far east side of the town which opened in October 2015. The store is the second largest Store that Aldi operates in Scotland and the largest in the county of East Lothian. The town also has a Farmfoods store.\n\nThere are many small convenience stores in Tranent. On the town's High Street, convenience stores include Thomsons Convenience Store and an Edinburgh Evening News store. On the south side of the town, in the Windygoul area, there is a Co-operative food store and in the west of the town, there is a Day-Today store.\n\nThe town has many football pitches, astroturf and rugby pitches. The town is also home to four children's play-parks. There are also three bookmakers – Ladbrokes, Betfred and William Hill. The town's leisure centre \"The Loch Centre\" has a swimming pool, children's soft play area, fitness gym and sports halls. There is also a major youth club in the town: \"Recharge\" supports teens and young adults from the area. A cinema and community centre is also located in the town centre: the \"Fraser Centre\" was formed in 2011 and \"aims to provide a Learning, Development, Arts and Entertainment Centre at the heart of the Community of Tranent\".\n\nTranent is home to many take-away food establishments such as Mr Crolla's, Joe's & Marmaris Grills (all fish and chip shops), Atlaf Khan & The Hill Station (both Indian takeaways) and The Tranent Villa, Canton Express & Gourmet Palace. Potter's sandwich shop, Snak Shack and Baguette Express are also located within the town.\n\nRestaurants in the town include Giancarlo's (an Italian restaurant) and a small café-style restaurant called The Coffee Lounge. A dessert shop called Sweet Haven is also located in Tranent, which sells ice cream, sweet desserts and \"pick and mix\" candies.\n\nThe town is also home to A S Gardener & Son Butcher, Janet's Green Grocers, The Bakers bakery and a Greggs branch.\n\nThe Brigg Inn, a local pub, also sells food at the Brigg Bar & Grill.\n\nThe town has an RBS branch.\n\nLocation Travel Agency is the town's only travel agent and is located at 136 High Street.\n\nAlex Lafferty Ltd is a lawyers firm also located in the town. The town is also home to three estate agents, Mckinnon and Forbes, Allan McDougall and GSB. All of these are located on the High Street\n\nLocal Businesses\n\nLocal businesses within the town include Bisset & Steedman which sells electronics, Veerman's Hardware & Pet Supplies, Gardners the Butcher, Location Travel Agency, Ferguson's Pet supplies, City Savers, A1 Sheds, Sweet Haven, Hoi Barbers and The East Lothian Camera Shop.\n\nBars in the town include The Tower Inn, The Keepers Arms, The Brigg Inn, The New Plough Inn and Whispers Bar.\n\nTranent falls within the NHS Lothian Health Board is home to two pharmacies: a Well Pharmacy and a Lloyds Pharmacy These pharmacies serve the local GP practice which is the responsibility of NHS Lothian. The nearest hospitals include The Roodlands General Hospital in Haddington which is a community hospital offering general medical and geriatric rehabilitation services to patients in East Lothian. It also provides older people’s services, including continuing care for the elderly and the nearest Accident and Emergency hospital is the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.\n\nThe A1 road also runs by the town with a junction at the north of the town.\n\nThe A199 road runs through the town westbound to Edinburgh, and eastbound to Macmerry.\n\nMost bus services in the town are operated by Transport For Edinburgh, these operations include Lothian Buses and East Coast Buses which provide services:\n\n26 Clerwood - Edinburgh Zoo - Haymarket - Princes Street - Portobello - Eastfield - Musselburgh - Prestonpans - Tranent\n\n104 West End - Princes Street - Abbeyhill - Meadowbank - Duddingston South - The Jewel - Wallyford - Tranent - Macmerry - Haddington\n\n113 West Granton - Western General - Princes Street - Meadowbank - Eastfield - Musselburgh - Wallyford- Tranent - Ormiston - Pencaitland\n\n106 Fort Kinnaird - Musselburgh - Wallyford - Tranent - Macmerry - Gladsmuir - Haddington - East Linton - West Barns - Belhaven - Dunbar\n\nN44 Balerno - Currie - Slateford - Haymarket - Princes Street - Meadowbank - Willowbrae - Eastfield - Musselburgh - Wallyford - Tranent\n\nN106 Frederick Street - Leith Street - Meadowbank - Willowbrae - Musselburgh - Tranent - Macmerry - Haddington - East Linton - Dunbar\n\nThe town is also served by Prentice, a bus & coach company based in Haddington, East Lothian\n\n108 Fort Kinnaird - Newcraighall - Musselburgh - Levenhall - Wallyford Station - Tranent - Macmerry - Gladsmuir - Haddington\n\n110 Elphinstone - Tranent - Meadowmill Sports Centre - Prestonspans - Port Seton\n\n122 Haddington - Pencaitland - Ormiston - New Winton - Elphinstone - Tranent - Meadowmill Sports Centre - Prestonpans\n\nThe town is home to three primary schools and one secondary school. The primary schools are; (largest to smallest) Windygoul Primary School, Sanderson's Wynd Primary School and St Martins Primary School. The secondary school Ross High School, Tranent established in 1954 accommodates over 1023 pupils from Tranent and villages around the area; these are Macmerry, Ormiston, Humbie, Elphinstone, Pencaitland, and Saltoun. The head teacher of Ross High School is Paul Reynolds.\n\nIn October 2012 a new council building was opened under the name of The George Johnstone Centre which is named in honour of the miner who saved the lives of more than 50 men at Fleets Pit, Tranent, when the mine flooded in 1929. The men took five hours to find an alternative way out, but all were rescued and survived thanks to the early warning given by George Johnstone. The building accommodates a range of services including a large library with a computer area, and council offices allowing local residents to access housing and tenancy advice, report a housing repair, report minor crime to Police Scotland and make Council Tax and rent payments and general enquiries. The building is run by East Lothian Council.\n\nThe local football team is Tranent Juniors who won the Scottish Junior Cup in 1934–35, being the runners up two seasons before. The Juniors play their football at Foresters Park in the centre of the town.\n\nThe Ross High Rugby Football Club currently plays in the RBS East Regional League Division 1 and play their home games at Blawearie Road, adjacent to the Ross High School.\n\nThe local club is Tranent Cricket Club which was established in 2010. The club currently plays in the East of Scotland Cricket Association Divisions 3, 6 and 7. The club has three Saturday league sides, two midweek social sides and a junior section, Tranent Titans. Tranent CC are the current holders of the East Lothian twenty20 Cup and the East of Scotland Plate.\n\nTranent is the home of Radio Saltire, Scotland's Online Community Radio Station. Its studios are on Civic Square.\n\nThroughout the history of Tranent there have been a number of places of Worship. Currently there is:\n\nTranent Parish Church (Church of Scotland) - The present church at Tranent was built by John Simpson and opened in 1800, as what is believed to be at least the third church in the town. Local legend has it that a chapel dedicated to St. Martin of Tours and was associated with Lindisfarne in the 8th century. The first known mention of a church at Tranent came in 1145 when it was established by the archdeacon, Thor, son of a local landowner. The church was granted by Richard, Archbishop of St Andrews and later confirmed by Saer de Quincy, the local baron. Tranent parish came under the jurisdiction of the canons of Holyrood Abbey and the building was described as being of a higher standard than the normal country church. Although a settlement grew around the church by 1251, it remained in the hands of Holyrood. There are also canonical records of a chapel, dedicated to St. Peter, situated on a ridge overlooking a coal-bearing ravine at Travernant.\n\nThe church was badly damaged in 1544 and 1547, each time by the forces of the Earl of Hertford during the Rough Wooing. Tranent Parish Church joined the Scottish Reformation when Thomas Cranstoun, the first minister took over from the evicted canons and the last Roman Catholic priest, Thomas Moffat; the church of St. Peter was now a reformed Protestant church. The church remained a ruinous condition, after Somerset's attack, into the 17th century and, though it was refurbished, it is not known when. The church was said to have been restored, extended and improved throughout, but in 1799 the decision was made to build a new church which was opened in 1800, a church which still stands high above the ravine overlooking the Firth of Forth. At a total cost of over 10,000 pounds, the church was extensively refurbished and refurnished in 1954. The congregation had to meet in the town hall during the work, but the church they returned to is much the same as it is today. The church is a category B listed building.\nMeets at 11am every Sunday unless intimated at the church located on Church Street.\n\nSt Martins of Tours (Roman Catholic) - This is the third church building on the site in one hundred years and was built in 1969, to designs by the prolific church architect Charles W Gray, in an octagonal shape using a Scandinavian compressed timber girder design. Contains two rough stained glass windows and an early 20th-century Italian crucifix above the altar. Irish limestone statue of classical design of St Martin as a Roman soldier and an original icon of St Martin in Orthodox style. Sunday Mass 9.30am; Monday Eucharistic Service, 9.00am; Tuesday Mass, 7.30pm; Wednesday Eucharistic Service, 10.00am; Thursday Mass, 10.00am; Thursday Mass, 10.00am; Friday Eucharistic service, 10.00am\n\nTranent and Cockenzie Methodist Church - Sunday service is at 11.00 am - In 2014, Cockenzie became a class of Tranent Methodist Church. In 2015, Tranent with Cockenzie began to meet and worship together at 28 Edinburgh Road, Prestonpans.\n\nThe Salvation Army - 10.30am, Sunday Worship. 25 Winton Place, Tranent.\n\nRivers of Fire Ministry - Formally the Fraser centre. Currently meet and worship with the Salvation Army and are in the process of building a new centre.\n\nThere are also a number of independent congregations who meet in and around Tranent.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1910533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910533", "title": "Nicandra physalodes", "text": "Nicandra physalodes\n\nNicandra physalodes is a species of flowering plant in subfamily Solanoideae of the nightshade family. It is known by the common names apple-of-Peru and shoo-fly plant. It is thought originally to have been native to western South America, including Peru, and is known elsewhere as an introduced and ruderal species – sometimes as a weed – in tropical, subtropical and, to a lesser extent, temperate areas all over the world. It has also long been cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive flowers and curious fruits (the latter sometimes dried for use in floral design) and has been adopted into the traditional medicine of countries far-removed from its original home.\n\nPlants grow to 1 metre tall and are vigorous with spreading branches and ovate, mid-green, toothed and waved leaves. The flowers are bell-shaped and 5 centimeters or more across, pale violet with white throats (occasionally pure white), opening only for a few hours in the day. The flower becomes lantern-like towards the end of its blooming period, the inflated calyces somewhat resembling those of certain \"Physalis\" spp., although in \"Nicandra\" (unlike in \"Physalis\") the fruiting calyx is deeply lobed, (the sepals cordate) and not a single, undivided, bladder-like structure. The plant is thought to have insect repellent properties, particularly in relation to whitefly. \"N. physalodes\" seeds have a relatively thick testa (seed coat) and exhibit strong dormancy, which may, however be broken by a combination of warm and cold stratification, involving temperature fluctuation between 15 and 25 °C.\n\n\"Nicandra physalodes\" is native to western South America – Northwest Argentina, Bolivia, North and Central Chile and Peru. It has been introduced in many tropical and temperate regions worldwide. In the British Isles, the plant is a frequent casual, found in bare or sparsely grassy places, including cultivated ground, waste places and rubbish tips. Its occurrence is often traceable to the presence of its seeds in commercial brands of bird seed.\n\n\"Nicandra physalodes\" is suspected of having poisonous properties similar to those possessed by certain \"Physalis\" species implicated in the poisoning of sheep. Some conflicting evidence in respect of these suspicions has emerged from Australia (where the plant is sometimes known as \"wild gooseberry\"), in which the plant has been suspected, on rather vague evidence, of poisoning stock at various times, although a feeding test carried out in New South Wales using a sheep and a goat gave negative results. A case was reported from New South Wales in 1970 in which two crossbred ewes died, apparently as a result of consuming this plant. The animals had been left to graze in a paddock of Wimmera ryegrass heavily infested with \"Nicandra physalodes\" plants of around 60 cm in height, such that they overtopped the grass. Both ewes died, with symptoms of bloat within 12 hours. At necropsy there were extensive hemorrhages in heart and lungs, but no other apparent abnormalities. The paunches of the ewes were observed to contain large amounts of \"Nicandra\".\n\nThe literature on the plant features somewhat conflicting accounts of use, as a species both edible and toxic/medicinal, pointing to the conclusion that it should be regarded as suspect and treated with caution. The whole plant is said to be toxic (even, according to some sources, very toxic) and to be used medicinally as a diuretic, sedative and cough medicine. The tender leaves have, on occasion, been cooked as a leaf vegetable or pot herb (e.g. in the cuisine of Tanzania), yet the decoction of the leaves has been used as an insecticide to treat head lice; while the juice of the fresh leaves has been used to treat amoebiasis. Unspecified medicinal uses of the leaves have also been recorded in the folk medicine of Brazil and Madagascar.\nThe rather dry, brown berries within the papery calyces have an odour reminiscent of cooking oil and, although described in at least one source as being poisonous, are eaten by the Raji people of Nepal.\nThe seeds are said to be edible, but also to be employed as an insecticide and medicinally as an antipyretic, being boiled with water and taken for fever,\nindigestion and constipation, thus further implying laxative properties. The seeds are used in traditional Tibetan medicine in which system they are described as having an acrid taste and to possess 'a cooling, very poisonous potency' manifested in effects that are analgesic, anthelmintic, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic; being used also to treat toothache, impotence and unspecified 'contagious disorders' and furthermore to 'increase bodily vigour' (i.e. to function as an adaptogen) if consumed in regular doses.\n\"Nicandra physalodes\" is used as a folk remedy in several countries in the Himalaya, including Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Nepal and Sikkim, although it is not native to the region. This may be due to a popular recognition of a familial resemblance - particularly in regard to calyces inflated at fruiting - to several native \nSolanaceous plants of the Himalaya long used in traditional medical practices, the genera involved being \"Anisodus\", \"Physochlaina\", \"Przewalskia\" and \"Scopolia\" (all belonging to tribe Hyoscyameae of subfamily Solanoideae). The much valued (and consequently over-harvested) species \"Anisodus tanguticus\" is perhaps particularly relevant in this context.\nIn the southern U.S.A. the juice of the plant has been mixed with milk as a poisoned bait for houseflies and blow flies in the same way in which the crumbled caps of the fungus \"Amanita muscaria\" were used in parts of Europe. However, the flies were said to be killed outright, rather than merely stupefied, as in the case of the mushroom/milk infusion.\n\n\"Nicandra physalodes\" contains nicandrenones, a group of the steroidal lactones known as withanolides. The nicandrenones, like certain other types of withanolide, have insecticidal properties. 30 years after their discovery, the first total synthesis of nicandrenones was carried out in the year 2000.\nAmongst its other paradoxical attributes, \"N. physalodes\" is also slightly intoxicating, showing a certain degree of psychoactivity of a type similar to that elicited by the tropane alkaloid hyoscyamine (well known as one of the active principles present in the notoriously toxic nightshades \"Hyoscyamus niger\" and \"Atropa belladonna\" and causing mydriasis - a symptom said also to be caused by the alkaloids present in \"Nicandra\").\nThis property of the plant is reflected in one of the common names given it in France (namely \"belladonne de pays\" i.e. 'country belladonna') and likewise in the common name \"belladona\" given it in Bolivia. It is not yet known whether this mild psychoactivity is referable to the alkaloid content or the withanolide content (or possibly to both - or indeed a synergy between the two). Like its more toxic relatives, \"Nicandra physalodes\" is alkaloidal, analyses having revealed the presence of the tropane alkaloid tropinone and the pyrrolidine alkaloid hygrine (0.1%, in the root). Withanolides are found almost exclusively in plants of the Solanaceae and, while it is noticeable that many psychoactive species belonging to that family contain only, or primarily, such compounds, not a single withanolide has yet been proven to be psychoactive. The compounds are named for the Solanaceous genus \"Withania\", the best-known species of which, \"Withania somnifera\", is, as its specific name suggests, mildly psychoactive to the extent of being sleep-inducing (among other useful medicinal properties). The use of \"W.somnifera\" (common name (i.a.) 'Indian ginseng') as a tonic (adaptogen) in Ayurvedic medicine parallels the use of \"Nicandra\" as an adaptogen in traditional Tibetan medicine (see above, under 'Uses') and is accounted for by withanolide content. Also present in \"Nicandra\" are calystegines, a new group of polyhydroxy alkaloids with a nortropane skeleton and named for the bindweed genus \"Calystegia\" (Convolvulaceae). Their occurrence has been noted in several species of the Solanaceae, including \"Atropa belladonna\". The biosynthesis of these compounds is thought to take place via the tropane alkaloid pathway, the first metabolite being pseudotropine.\n\n"}

Hulk Hogan appeared in the main event of all four editions of the event.\n\nWrestleCrap writer Art O'Donnell criticised the event as a \"financial blunder\" and said that WCW held \"a yearly pay-per-view at a biker rally with zero live gate just because Eric Bischoff loves motorcycles\".\n\nSince 2001, WWE (through its subsidiary WCW, Inc.) owns the rights to the event. In 2015, all WCW pay-per-views were made available on the WWE Network.\n"}

He was also a vital figure in the establishment of professional baseball in Japan.\n\nBorn in San Francisco, California, O'Doul began his professional career as a left-handed pitcher with the minor-league San Francisco Seals of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. He had some major-league success with the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox from to as a reliever. He pitched in one notable game on July 7, 1923, that would go down in the record books. Relieving for starter Curt Fullerton, O'Doul gave up 16 runs over 3 innings of relief, with 14 of those runs coming in the 6th inning alone. Although errors committed by Red Sox fielders meant that only 3 of the 16 runs were earned, O'Doul set the major league record for most runs allowed by a reliever in one appearance, a record later equaled by St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Johnny Stuart in 1925 and Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Dutch Schesler in 1931 (although both needed 8 innings to allow 16 runs). Following the season, O'Doul developed a sore arm, which forced him to give up pitching.\n\nAfter the 1923 season, the New York Giants returned O'Doul to the Pacific Coast League, where he was converted to a power-hitting outfielder. In 1927, he became the second of only four Pacific Coast League hitters to have hit 30 home runs and stolen 30 bases in a season (with the other three being Tony Lazzeri (1925), Frank Demaree (1934), and Joc Pederson (2014)).\n\nO'Doul returned to the majors in 1928, where he batted .319 as a platoon player. In , he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies and, teaming up with Chuck Klein, had one of the best offensive years in baseball history, leading the league in batting at .398 with 254 hits, 32 home runs, 122 runs batted in, and 152 runs scored. His hit total broke the previous National League record of 250 by Rogers Hornsby of the 1922 St. Louis Cardinals. The record was tied by Bill Terry in .\n\nAfter batting .383 with 22 homers during the 1930 season, O'Doul was traded to the Brooklyn Robins (now the Los Angeles Dodgers). In , he batted .368 for Brooklyn to win another league batting title. After a slow start in , when he batted just .252 through 43 games, O'Doul was again traded, this time back to the Giants. He rallied to hit .306 the rest of the way that season, but played just one more year before ending his career in .\n\nIn an 11-year major league career, he was in 970 games played, 34 games as a relief pitcher and the rest as an outfielder, posting a .349 batting average (1140-for-3264) with 624 runs scored, 175 doubles, 41 triples, 113 home runs, and 542 RBI. His on-base percentage was .413 and slugging percentage was .532. In seven seasons between 1928 and 1934, when he became a regular outfielder, he hit .353 (1126-for-3192). O'Doul hit over .300 six times, missing only in 1933 when he hit .284 playing with the Dodgers and Giants. He had 200+ hit seasons in 1929, 1930 and 1932. He had six five-hit games between 1929 and 1933, recording two each in 1929 and 1930 with the Phillies and one each in 1931 and 1933 with the Dodgers.\n\nO'Doul then returned to the Pacific Coast League as manager of the San Francisco Seals from to , later managing several other teams in the circuit and becoming the most successful manager in PCL history. One of his outstanding accomplishments while managing the Seals was developing the young Joe DiMaggio, who went on to a Hall of Fame career with the New York Yankees. O'Doul refused to take credit for DiMaggio's success, saying \"I was just smart enough to leave him alone.\"\n\nO'Doul was instrumental in spreading baseball's popularity in Japan, serving as the sport's goodwill ambassador before and after World War II. The Tokyo Giants, sometimes considered \"Japan's Baseball Team\", were named by him in 1935 in honor of his longtime association with the New York Giants; the logo and uniform of the Giants in Japan strongly resemble their North American counterparts.\n\nO'Doul was inducted into the San Francisco Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame in 1981 and the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 2002. He has the highest career batting average of any player eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame who is not enshrined. Contrary to popular belief, his hitting exceeded the standard of his era, had he played his first full season prior to the age of 31, he would have likely been inducted.\n\nO’Doul was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals in 2013.\n\nO'Doul's fame and popularity live on in his hometown of San Francisco and are enhanced by the fact that his former team now thrives as the San Francisco Giants. The popular hofbrau-style restaurant and bar he founded in 1958 operated for years after his death as Lefty O'Doul's Restaurant and Cocktail Lounge on Geary Street, still serving his original recipe for Bloody Mary (although one news account says it was modified in the 1960s by O'Doul's bartender Chuck Davis). However, a landlord-tenant dispute caused it to close its doors in early 2017. In November of 2018, the restaurant reopened in a new location at Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nA bridge over McCovey Cove, near the Giants' home field of Oracle Park, is named the Lefty O'Doul Bridge in his honor. Accordingly, the ballpark plaza and gate entrance adjacent to the bridge are also named after O'Doul.\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

The club is situated close to the city centre, in the east side of town, on the former farmland of Hlíðarendi. The club was originally formed as part of the local YMCA to play association football, but later incorporated handball and basketball. Valur's handball section reached the EHF Champions League final in 1980. It has won the Icelandic league 22 times, more than any other Icelandic handball team.\n\nIn 2019, Valur women's teams won the national championships in basketball, football and handball, the first time that one club held all three major titles. The Valur women's basketball team also won all four major titles during the year and 47 of their 50 games. For this feat, it was selected as the Icelandic Sports Team of the Year by the Icelandic Association of Sports Journalists in an annual ceremony held by the National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland.\n\nThe club was founded on 11 May 1911, as a subdivision of KFUM, the Icelandic YMCA. Later that year its name was changed to Valur, which is an Icelandic word for gyrfalcon. In 1930 the club won its first national title, and it has been amongst the best football teams in the country ever since. In 1939 Valur bought the farmland of Hlíðarendi which retains its name even today, where they now have a football field and an indoor arena.\n\nOriginally Valur played only football, but around 1940 the club got involved in more sports, starting with men's handball. They won their first national handball title in 1940, and reached the final of the EHF Champions League in 1980. In the post-war era (1948), a women's handball division was started at Valur, and in the 1970s a women's football division was added. In 1970, Körfuknattleiksfélag Reykjavíkur (Reykjavík Basketball Club, KFR) joined Valur and became their basketball division.\n\nValur is the most successful sports club in ballgame with 120 titles across football, handball and basketball in both men's and women's Icelandic and Cup championships. It is the wealthiest sports club in Iceland.\n\nThe grounds at Hlíðarendi were completely renovated in the years between 2004 and 2007. Valur's football teams currently play their home games at Valsvöllur and basketball and handball teams in the Valshöllin, the first section of the new grounds to be utilised. The football pitch was used for the first time in the 2008 season.\n\nIn June 2007 the club signed a 5-year sponsorship deal with Vodafone. In June 2018 the club signed a five-year sponsorship deal with Origo which saw the football stadium being renamed Origovöllurinn and the indoor stadium being renamed Origo-höllin (English: Origo arena).\n\nThe Valur men's basketball team was founded as \"Gosi\" on 25 December 1951 and was one of the founding members of the Icelandic men's top division. On 22 December 1957 the club changed its name to \"Körfuknattleiksfélag Reykjavíkur\" (Reykjavík Basketball Club) and played under that name until 1970. On 3 October 1970 the club merged into Valur sports club and became its basketball department.\n\nUnder the new name it has won the Icelandic Championship two times, 1980 and 1983, and the Icelandic cup three times, 1980, 1981 and 1983.\n\n\nAs of 2018, the Valur women's basketball team plays in the top-tier Úrvalsdeild kvenna. It played in the 2018 Úrvalsdeild finals, losing to Haukar 2-3.\n\nValur first competed in Europe at the 1966–67 European Cup Winners' Cup Preliminary Round, playing to a draw (1–1) in its first match against Standard Liège, ultimately losing on aggregate 9–2. Since then, the club has participated in European competition 20 times, never advancing beyond the second round of any tournament.\n\n\nÚrvalsdeild\n\nIcelandic Cup\n\nIcelandic League Cup\n\nIcelandic Super Cup\n\nThe Valur women's football team has won the Icelandic championship 10 times and the Icelandic Women's Cup 13 times.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Some of her records are credited to Yazz & The Plastic Population.\n\nYazz was born in Shepherd's Bush, London, to a Jamaican father and English mother. She attended Holland Park School, where she excelled at sports, including the 400 metres. She was also a member of the England under-19 volleyball team. Following a spell as a catwalk model, she scored a number of club hits after recording with the group The Biz in 1983. Her first commercial success came in early 1988, when she sang on Coldcut's \"Doctorin' the House\". She soon launched a solo career on Big Life records, a label set up by her husband Jazz Summers, releasing her debut solo single, \"The Only Way Is Up\", in the summer of 1988. It went on to spend five weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart, eventually becoming the second-biggest-selling UK single of the year. Her follow-up \"Stand Up for Your Love Rights\" was another big hit (UK number 2),) while her debut album \"Wanted\" (UK number 3) was certified double platinum in the UK in September 1989 for sales exceeding 600,000.\n\nShe had a fourth UK top-10 single in 1989 with \"Fine Time\", but has since recorded only sporadically. A second Big Life album, titled \"Revolution of Love\", was scheduled for release in 1990 following the single \"Treat Me Good\" (peaking at number 20 in the UK). The album was shelved, however, when Yazz parted ways with the label.\n\nYazz signed with Polydor Records, and an album titled \"One True Woman\" was scheduled for release in May 1992 following the release of the title track, but was also cancelled. She returned to the Top 40 in 1993, performing with Aswad on the hit \"How Long\". Her second album, \"One on One\" was finally released in 1994, including some of the tracks recorded for the \"One True Woman\" album.\n\nShe continued to release singles throughout the 1990s, including a cover version of The Jackson 5's \"Never Can Say Goodbye\". In 1997, she released \"The Natural Life\", an album of cover versions, after signing with East West Records. The album was released in Japan, Australia and some parts of Europe, but not in the UK.\n\nDuring this period, Yazz began to reevaluate her career choices: she wanted to give up a lifestyle that included her failed marriage to Summers (their union had resulted in a daughter, Rio, born in April 1990), and her dependency on alcohol. After she had researched various religions, a friend who used to be her hairstylist suggested she try visiting her church. Soon, she decided to \"turn her life over to Christ\".\n\nHer 2008 album \"Running Back to You\", distributed in the UK by ICC Records, charted her spiritual journey and her new-found Christian faith. Yazz is now based in Spain, and is an active member of the Calahonda Baptist Church. She returned to Britain occasionally to promote this album, performing songs from it live interspersed with several anecdotes pertaining to her faith.\n\nIn August 2009, Yazz performed with a full band on stage for the first time in several years at a church in Southampton. In October 2010, she performed again with a band at Cathedral House in Huddersfield, home of the Huddersfield Christian Fellowship.\n\nA three-CD remastered deluxe edition of the \"Wanted\" album, containing Yazz's 1990 single \"Treat Me Good\", B-sides and remixes, was released on Cherry Red Records on 25 November 2016.\n\n"}
{"id": "1910616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910616", "title": "Gyeongsang dialect", "text": "Gyeongsang dialect\n\nThe Gyeongsang dialects (also spelled Kyŏngsang), or Southeastern Korean, are dialects of the Korean language of the Yeongnam region, which includes both Gyeongsang provinces,\nNorth and South. There are approximately 13,000,000 speakers. Unlike Standard Korean, most of the variants of the Gyeongsang dialects are tonal, which is similar to Middle Korean.\n\nGyeongsang dialects vary. A native speaker can distinguish the dialect of Daegu from that of the Busan-Ulsan area although the first city is less than 100 kilometers away from the latter two cities. Dialectal forms are relatively similar along the midstream of Nakdong River but are different near Busan and Ulsan, Jinju and Pohang as well as along the eastern slopes of Mount Jiri.\n\nMost Gyeongsang dialects have six vowels, \"a\" (ㅏ), \"e\" (ㅔ), \"i\" (ㅣ), \"eo\" (ㅓ), \"o\" (ㅗ), \"u\" (ㅜ). In most areas, the vowels ㅐ(ae) and ㅔ (e) are conflated, as are ㅡ(eu) and ㅓ(eo). \"W\" and \"y\" are generally dropped after a consonant, especially in South Gyeongsang dialects. For example, \"soegogi\" (쇠고기) 'beef' is pronounced \"sogogi\" (소고기), and \"gwaja\" (과자) 'confectionery' is pronounced \"ggaja\" (까자).\n\nVowels are fronted when the following syllable has a \"y\" or \"i\", unless a coronal consonant intervenes. For example, \"eomi\" 'mother' is \"emi\", and \"gogi\" 'meat' is \"gegi\".\n\nSouthern Gyeongsang (specifically, nearby Namhae) dialects lack the tense consonant \"ss\" (ㅆ). Thus, the speakers pronounce \"ssal\" (쌀), meaning \"rice\", as \"sal\" (살) meaning \"flesh\". Palatalization is widespread: \"gy, gi, ki\" and \"ky\" are pronounced \"j\" and \"ch\", e.g. 귤 is \"jul\" and 기름 is \"jileum\", while \"hy\" is pronounced \"s,\" e.g. 힘 is \"sim\". Many words have tense consonants where the standard is tenuis. Middle Korean \"z\" and \"β\" are preserved as \"s\" and \"b,\" as in 새비 \"saebi\" for Standard Korean 새우 \"saeu\" \"shrimp\" or 가새 \"gasae\" for Standard Korean 가위 \"gawi\" \"scissors\".\n\nDialects are classified as North Gyeongsang or South Gyeongsang based on pitch accent. North Gyeongsang has high tone, low tone (short vowel), and high tone (long vowel), whereas South Gyeongsang has high, mid, and low tone. For example, South Gyeongsang distinguishes \"sóni\" 'guest', \"sōni\" 'hand', and \"sòni\" 'grandchild'. Pitch accent plays a grammatical role as well, for example distinguishing causative and passive as in \"jép-pida\" 'make s.o. catch' and \"jepída\" 'be caught'.\n\nIn North Gyeongsang, any syllable may have pitch accent in the form of a high tone, as may the two initial syllables. For example, in trisyllabic words, there are four possible tone patterns: \n\nThe Gyeongsang dialect maintains a trace of Middle Korean: the grammar of the dialect distinguishes between a yes-no question and a wh-question, while Standard Modern Korean does not. With an informal speech level, for example, yes-no questions end with \"-a (아)\" and wh-questions end with \"-o (오)\" in the Gyeongsang dialect, whereas in standard speech both types of questions end in either \"-ni (니)\" or \"-eo (어)\" without a difference between the types of questions. For example:\n — \"Did you have a meal?\" or \"Did you eat?\" \n — \"What did you eat?\"\n\nNotice that the first question can be answered with a yes or no, while the latter question requires detail explanation of the food eaten.\n\nThis phenomenon can also be observed in tag questions, which are answered with a yes or no.\n — \"It isn't there, is it?\"\n\nFrom the Park Chung-hee to the Kim Young-sam governments (1961–1997), the Gyeongsang dialect had greater prominence in the Korean media than other dialects as all of the presidents (except Choi Kyu-hah) were natives of Gyeongsang province. That is why some South Korean politicians or high-rank officials have been misunderstood for not trying to convert to the Seoul accent, which is considered standard in South Korea.\n\nHowever, former president Kim Young-sam was criticised (when he was in office) for failing to pronounce precisely when giving a public speech. He once mistakenly pronounced '경제 (Gyeongje: meaning 'economy')' as '갱제 (Gaengje: a Gyeongsang pronunciation of the older generation for '경제')' and '외무부 장관 (oemubu-janggwan: meaning 'foreign minister')' as '애무부 장관 (aemubu-janggwan: meaning 'physical intimacy minister')'. In addition, there was a rumour concerning one of his public speeches that audiences were surprised to hear that he would make Jeju a world-class 'rape' (관광 [\"gwan gwang\", tourism] > 강간 [\"gang-gan\", rape]) city by building up an 'adultery' (관통하는 [\"gwantonghaneun\", penetrating]) > 간통하는 [\"gantonghaneun\", adulterous]) motorway.\n\n\n"}

Founded in Belgrade in 1984 by composer, lyricist and guitarist Momčilo Bajagić \"Bajaga\", the group possesses a rich discography and a plethora of hit songs that placed them at the top of the former Yugoslav rock scene, alongside other mega-selling bands such as Bijelo Dugme and Riblja Čorba.\n\nThe band's history begins in 1983. At the time Momčilo Bajagić \"Bajaga\" was the guitarist for the hard rock band Riblja Čorba. During his work with Riblja Čorba, Bajagić wrote music and both music and lyrics for several Riblja Čorba hits, but also wrote a large number of humorous pop-oriented songs that did not fit into Riblja Čorba's sound. He decided to release these songs on a solo album, and he started working on the album with a group of Belgrade musicians: vocalist Dejan Cukić (a former Dizel, Tilt, and Bulevar member, and at the time a journalist working in the magazine \"Rock\"), bass guitarist Miroslav Cvetković \"Cvele\" (a former Tilt, Pop Mašina, and Papatra member), guitarist Nenad Stamatović (a former Tilt, Zebra, Suncokret, and Bulevar member), and drummer Vladimir Golubović (a former Tilt and Suncokret member, at the time temporarily replacing Vicko Milatović in Riblja Čorba).\n\nDuring the work on the album, Bajagić wanted only to record a large number of songs he wrote on an album and to remain a member of Riblja Čorba. The songs for the album were recorded in a rented apartment and in Radio Television Belgrade Studio V and produced by Kornelije Kovač. The album, beside mentioned musicians, featured Nenad Stefanović \"Japanac\" on bass guitar, a former Generacija 5 member Dragan \"Krle\" Jovanović on guitar, Kire Mitrev on trombone, Ivan Švager on clarinet, and Suzana Petričević on vocals in the song \"Papaline\" (\"Sprats\"). The album, entitled \"Pozitivna geografija\" (\"Positive Geography\") was released at the end of January 1984 and was well received by the audience, bringing hits \"Berlin\", \"Mali slonovi\" (\"Little Elephants\"), \"Poljubi me\" (\"Kiss Me\"), \"Limene trube\" (\"Brass Trumpets\"), \"Tekila gerila\" (\"Tequila Guerrilla\"), \"Marlena\", and \"Tamara\". The album also featured the anti-drug song \"Znam čoveka\" (\"I Know a Man\"), dedicated to Dragan Đerić \"Đera\", Bajagić's former bandmate from the bands Ofi and Glogov Kolac. Initially, Bajagić had no intention of promoting \"Pozitivna geografija\" in concert, but eventually decided to listen to the advice of some and hold several concerts. Bajagić and musicians working on the album held their first concert in Zagreb club Kulušić on April 12, 1984. Beside the musicians that worked on the album, the concert also featured vocalist Žika Milenković (Bajagić's former bandmate from the band Ofi, and a former Mačori member and an actor in the amateur theatre Teatar levo), keyboardist Dragan Mitrić (a former Bulevar member) and Kornelije Kovač, Milenković soon becoming an official member of the band. During their staying in Zagreb Bajagić and Cukić appeared as guests on the recording of Parni Valjak album \"Uhvati ritam\", singing backing vocals on the title track, which was the sign of gratitude to Parni Valjak for lending them a piece of drum kit for their first concert. The band held the official album promotion, organized by the \"Rock\" magazine, in Belgrade Dom Sindikata on April 21, and on this concert the band appeared under the name Bajaga i Instruktori, chosen after the idea of the journalist Peca Popović, for the first time. The concert featured Valentino and Bezobrazno Zeleno as the opening bands. The concert was well visited (mostly by teenagers) and the band's performance was well received.\n\nThe success of Bajagić's solo album caused conflicts inside Riblja Čorba, and on July 19, 1984, he was excluded from the band. During that summer Bajaga i Instruktori went on a tour, with Rade Radivojević on keyboards, playing mostly at youth work actions. At the end of the year, in the \"Rock\" magazine, Bajagić was proclaimed the Rock Musician of the Year, and \"Pozitivna geografija\" was voted the Album of the Year by musicians. At the beginning of 1985, the band recorded the album \"Sa druge strane jastuka\" (\"On the Other Side of the Pillow\"), produced by Kornelije Kovač and Saša Habić. The album featured a large number of guests: Branko Mačić on jazz guitar, Stjepko Gut on trumpet and flugelhorn, Sava Medan on double bass, Jovan Maljoković on saxophone, Mića Marković on saxophone, Nenad Stefanović \"Japanac\" on bass guitar, Dragan \"Krle\" Jovanović on guitar, and others. The album brought hits \"220 u voltima\" (\"220 Volt\"), \"Vidi šta mi je uradio od pesme, mama\" (a Serbian language cover of the Melanie Safka song \"Look What They've Done to My Song Ma\"), \"Ti se ljubiš (Na tako dobar način)\" (\"You Kiss (In a great Manner)\"), \"Dvadeseti vek\" (\"Twentieth Century\"), and ballads \"Dobro jutro, džezeri\" (\"Good Morning, Jazzers\"), \"Sa druge strane jastuka\" and \"Zažmuri\" (\"Close Your Eyes\"). The album was promoted with a 7 inch vinyl which on its B-side has a track with software for ZX Spectrum titled \"Kompjuterska informacija za Sinclair Spectrum\". For the first time Milenković was an author of a song, co-writing the song \"Francuska ljubavna revolucija\" (\"French Love Revolution\") with Bajagić. At this time the band's manager became a former U Škripcu manager Saša Dragić.\nIn March, Bajaga i Instruktori presented their new songs to the Zagreb audience in Kulušić, as a part of the \"BG-ZG: Bolje vas našli\" action. Several days later, in the night between March 9 and 10, they performed in Toulouse on the Night of Mediterranean Rock. Although they performed around 4:00 AM, they were well received and performed three encores. After this concert Rade Radivojević left the band, and was replaced by a former Potop and Galija member Saša Lokner. The band went on a successful Yugoslav tour, on which they held two concerts on Tašmajdan Stadium, on June 8 and 9. In May 1985, Bajagić and Cukić took a part in YU Rock Misija, a Yugoslav contribution to Live Aid, and on June 15, Bajaga i Instruktori performed on the YU Rock Misija concert held on the Red Star Stadium. In the autumn of 1985, Bajaga i Instruktori and Bijelo Dugme performed on the Moscow Festival of Youth and Students, as a part of Yugoslav delegation. Bajaga i Instruktori performed in the Gorky Park in front of about 100,000 people, and, as there was a serious risk of attendants getting hurt, the concert was interrupted. During the following days the band performed in the Moscow Dinamo Hall, Green Theatre (with the bands Misty in Roots and Everything but the Girl), Pioneers Home, and Vakhtangov Theatre. After they returned to Yugoslavia they continued their tour on which they held more than 120 concerts. The band also performed on the rock evening of the Intertalent Festival in Prague. At the end of 1985, in the magazine \"Rock\", Bajaga i Instruktori were voted by the critics the Rock Band of the Year, Bajagić the Rock Musician of the Year, \"Zažmuri\" the Song of the Year, and \"Sa druge strane jastuka\" the Album of the Year. The album was sold in more than 350,000 copies, and the band was awarded with the May 25 award by the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia. The band went on a break during which Lokner and Golubović performed in jazz clubs with jazz musicians Stjepko Gut (trumpet), Miša Krstić (piano), and Nenad Petrović (saxophone).\n\nIn the summer of 1986, the band members reunited to record the album \"Jahači magle\" (\"Fog Riders\"). The album, produced by Saša Habić featured numerous guests: Josipa Lisac on vocals in \"Ja mislim 300 na sat\" (\"I Think at 300 kmph\"), Kornelije Kovač, bass guitarist Bata Božanić, guitarists Duda Bezuha, Rajko Kojić (Bajagić's former bandmate from Riblja Čorba), Vlada Negovanović, and Jane Parđovski, trumpeter Goran Grbić, and keyboardist Đorđe Petrović. The band recorded a cover of The Beatles song \"All You Need Is Love\", entitled \"All You Need Is Love (verzija 1986)\" (\"All You Need Is Love (Version 1986)\") which was released on a 7\" single given as a gift with an issue of \"Rock magazine\" before the album release. The B-side featured clips from the songs from \"Jahači magle\". The single was printed in 99,999 copies. After the single release, the album was released, bringing hits \"Ja mislim 300 na sat\", \"442 do Beograda\" (\"442 to Belgrade\"), with a bass guitar riff written by Božanić, \"Bam, Bam, Bam\", \"Rimljani\" (\"Romans\"), and Milenković's \"Samo nam je ljubav potrebna\" (\"All We Need Is Love\"). The band went on a successful tour, which ended with a concert held at Belgrade's Sajmište on November 22, 1986, in front of about 20,000 visitors. After the end of a tour the band made a break once again. Bajagić travelled to Thailand, and in June 1987 Cukić released his first solo album \"Spori ritam\" (\"Slow Rhythm\"). After that, Bajaga i Instruktori went on a two-month Soviet Union tour, during which they held 42 concerts. After they returned to Yugoslavia, Cukić left Bajaga i Instruktori conventionally and formed his Spori Ritam Band.\n\nBajaga i Instruktori recorded their following album \"Prodavnica tajni\" (\"The Shop of Secrets\") in 1988 in Novi Sad. The album, named after Dino Buzzati book \"La boutique del mistero\", (the songs, however, had no connection with the book), was produced by Saša Habić. Milenković co-wrote the songs \"Ruski voz\" (\"Russian Train\"), \"Život je nekad siv, nekad žut\" (\"Life Is Sometimes Grey and Sometimes Yellow\"), and \"Vesela pesma\" (\"Merry Song\"). The album marked a slight stylistic change in the band's sound: the songs were simpler, without brass instruments, frequent on the band's previous releases, based on acoustic guitars and keyboards, and the songs \"Plavi safir\" (\"Blue Sapphire\"), \"Vesela pesma\", \"Život je nekad siv, nekad žut\" and \"Ruski voz\" featured folk music elements. However, virtually every song on the album became a hit. The band went on another successful tour, during which they recorded the double live/compilation album \"Neka svemir čuje nemir\" (\"May the Universe Hear the Unrest\"). The album featured new songs \"Na vrhovima prstiju\" (\"On the Tips of Your Toes\"), \"Idem (Kao da ne idem, a idem)\" (\"I'm Going (Like I'm not Going, but I'm Going\"), which is the first Bajaga i Instruktori song sung entirely by Milenković, and \"Neka svemir čuje nemir\", which is a cover of a traditional Indian song, and acoustic studio versions of \"Tamara\" and \"Tekila gerila\". The live recordings were made during the band's concerts in Zagreb's Dom Sportova, held on March 6, 1989, and from Novi Sad EBU Rock Festival, and also a recording of the journalist Dražen Vrdoljak announcing the band on their concert in Kulušić, held on December 8, 1984. The album also featured a live version of the song \"Kad hodaš\", written by Bajagić and originally recorded by Riblja Čorba. During the tour that followed the album release the band held two sold out concerts in Belgrade's Pionir Hall. Despite the growing nationalism the band was well accepted in all parts of Yugoslavia. The only incident on the tour happened in Split, where the fans of the football club Hajduk Split threw various objects on the stage, but after the intervention of the security the concert was continued. At the beginning of 1990, Bajaga i Instruktori, Riblja Čorba, Valentino, Viktorija and Galija, performed in Timișoara, Romania, at the three-day concerts organized two months after the Romanian Revolution. All five acts performed on three concerts in Timișoara Olympia Hall in front of some 20,000 people each night. The festival also featured several less known British acts and Yugoslav acts Riblja Čorba, Valentino, Galija and Viktorija.\n\nIn 1991, the band released the EP \"Četiri godišnja doba\" (\"Four Seasons\"), which featured the songs \"Uspavanka\" (\"Lullaby\"), \"Buđenje ranog proleća\" (\"Waking up of the Early Spring\"), \"Dobro jutro\" (\"Good Morning\"), and \"U koži krokodila\" (\"In Crocodile Skin\"). The EP featured opera singer Jadranka Jovanović. During 1992, despite the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars, Bajaga i Instruktori performed and held successful concerts in Macedonia and Slovenia. During the same year Milenković, with Električni Orgazam member Goran Čavajda, Riblja Čorba member Zoran Ilić, and a former Bezobrazno Zeleno member Bojan Vasić, formed the band Babe. In 1993 Bajaga i Instruktori released the album \"Muzika na struju\" (\"Electric Music\"). The song \"Marinina tema\" (\"Marina's Theme\") was written for the theatre play \"Život Jovanov\" (\"Life of Jovan\") directed by Darko Bajić, and the theme \"Nakostrešena mačka\" (\"Bristled Cat\") was written by Milenković. The anti-war ballad \"Golubica\" (\"Dove\") featured Aleksandra and Kristina Kovač, Oktobar 1864 vocalist Tanja Jovićević and Marija Mihajlović on backing vocals. The song was based on the instrumental Bajagić played at Terazijska česma during the March 9, 1991 protest. Beside \"Golubica\", the album featured anti-war songs \"Gde si\" (\"Where Are You\") and \"Ovo je Balkan\" (\"This Is the Balkans\"). The album was promoted on concerts in Montenegro and Macedonia, and on a sold out concert in Belgrade's Hala sportova. At this time Bajagić started performing alone in the clubs abroad.\n\nAt the beginning of 1994, Bajaga i Instruktori planned to perform in Slovenia, and there was a huge interest by the audience for these concerts. However, Slovenian authorities refused to issue visas to the band, which caused a scandal in Slovenian media. After the intervention of the Slovenian president Milan Kučan, visas were issued to the members of the band, and they performed several concerts including a sold out concert in the Tivoli Hall. In March 1994 the band held three concerts in Belgrade's Dom Sindikata, with which they celebrated ten years of existence. After these concerts Bajagić and Dragić ended their cooperation. For a certain time, manager duties were carried on by Bajagić, before Zoran Vulović, a former U Škripcu keyboardist, became the band's new manager. In November 1994, after a concert in Priština, came to conflicts inside the band, and Bajagić excluded Stamatović and Golubović from the band, which ended Bajaga i Instruktori activity. At the time Bajagić, with Lokner, wrote music for Miša Radivojević's film \"Ni na nebu ni na zemlji\" (\"Neither on the Sky nor on the Earth\"). The recordings featured members of the starogradska muzika band Legende (in the hit song \"Moji drugovi\"), Dragan Jovanović on acoustic guitar, Sava Latinović on tarabuka, and Aleksandra and Kristina Kovač on backing vocals. The music was released on the album \"Ni na nebu ni na zemlji\". During the same year Bajagić wrote music for the TV show \"Otvorena vrata\" (\"Opened Door\").\n\nIn 1996, Bajagić reformed Bajaga i Instruktori. The new lineup featured, beside Bajagić, Milenković, Cvetković, and Lokner, the guitarist Vlada Negovanović (a former Butik, Doktor Spira i Ljudska Bića, Slađana Milošević's backing band, Tunel, and Dejan Cukić's Spori Ritam Band member), and the drummer Čeda Macura (a former Neverne Bebe, Viktorija's backing band, Legija and Revolveri member). At the end of 1996 the band recorded the album \"Od bižuterije do ćilibara\" (\"From Bijouterie to Amber\"). Bajagić wrote all the songs, except \"Ne volim zimu\" (\"I Don't Like Winter\"), featuring music written by Milenković. The album was produced by the band members, and featured Saša Habić on cello. The album featured hits \"Silikon (2004)\" (\"Silicon (2004)\"), Tvoja je gajba sigurna\" (\"Your Place Is Safe\"), \"Još te volim\" (\"I Still Love You\"), \"Iza nas...\" (\"Behind Us...\"), \"Ne volim zimu\", and \"Što ne može niko možeš ti\" (\"You Can Do What Nobody Else Can\"). The album was promoted on a free concert held on Belgrade's Republic Square on May 12, 1997. On 1997 the Slovenian record label Biveco released the compilation album \"Neizbrisano\" (\"Unerased\"). The album featured recordings from the various periods of Bajagić's and Bajaga i Instruktori career. It featured remixed songs from the \"Četiri godišnja doba\" EP, the instrumental \"Radovan III\", written for the play of the same name, \"Tribute to Buldožer\", a cover of Buldožer song \"Yes My Baby, No\", a new version of \"Moji drugovi\" featuring Vlada Divljan, Sokoli cover of Bijelo Dugme song \"Ne spavaj, mala moja\" featuring Bajagić on vocals, and songs \"Montenegro\" and \"Januar\" (\"January\").\n\nIn 2001, the band recorded the album \"Zmaj od Noćaja\" (\"Dragon of Noćaj\") with the new guitarist, Ljubiša \"Buba\" Opačić. The album was produced by Saša Habić. The album featured a cover of The Clash song \"Should I Stay or Should I Go\", entitled \"Da li da odem ili ne\". \"Zmaj od Noćaja\" featured a bonus CD entitled \"I ja sam Zvezdaš\" (\"I'm a Red Star Fan, Too\"), which featured three versions of the song \"Zvezda\" (\"Star\"), dedicated to the football club Red Star Belgrade. The album featured hits \"Zmaj od Noćaja\" and \"Lepa Janja, ribareva kći\" (\"Pretty Janja, the Fisher's Daughter\"), and minor hits \"Da li da odem ili ne\" and \"Ala\" (\"Ala\").\n\nIn 2002, the band released the album \"Best of Live\", which featured recordings from their concerts in Belgrade, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Timișoara, Skopje, and Niš. It features two previously unrecorded songs: a song in Slovenian, \"Slovenačka reč\" (\"A Word in Slovenian\"), recorded live, featuring music from the band's old song \"Idem (Kao da ne idem, a idem)\" and lyrics written by Slovenian journalist Sonja Javorik, and a song in Macedonian, \"Pesna protiv maleri\" (\"A Song against Bad Luck\"), recorded in studio for the theatre play \"Kutrite mali hrčki\" (\"Poor Little Hamsters\") by Skopje Drama Theatre. In 2003, Bajagić, with the members of the band Apsolutno Romantično, recorded the soundtrack for Dušan Kovačević's film \"The Professional\", released on the album \"\" (\"The Professional: Music from the Film\"). During the same year, the band released the compilation album \"Ruža vetrova Beograda\" (\"Belgrade Wind Rose\"), which, after the idea of Peca Popović, featured the band's songs inspired by the city of Belgrade.

{"id": "1910626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910626", "title": "Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada", "text": "Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada\n\nThe Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada, also known as the Romanow Report, is a committee study led by Roy Romanow on the future of health care in Canada. It was delivered in December 2002.\n\nRomanow recommended sweeping changes to ensure the long-term sustainability of Canada's health care system. The proposed changes were outlined in the Commission's Final Report, Building on Values: The Future of Health Care in Canada, which was tabled in the House of Commons on 28 November 2002.\n\nAlthough the Report of the Royal Commission dealt with a wide range of issues, much of the early attention was paid to the recommendations with respect to the financing of health care in Canada and especially transfers from the federal government to provincial and territorial governments.\n\nThe Report set the stage for another round of federal-provincial/territorial bargaining leading to a significant agreement in September 2004 whereby the Government of Canada agreed to transfer an additional $41 billion over the next 10 years in support of an action plan on health. The new funding is meant to strengthen ongoing federal health support provided through the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) as well as focus resources on addressing the fact that Canadians, like citizens in other OECD countries, often have significant wait times for access to essential health care services.\n\nThe report identifies significant problems in the way that aboriginal health is managed. Surprisingly, this is largely not due to a lack of funding; there is simply a mismanagement of assets. Funding sources are fragmented and there is no established system to provide care. In addition, there are extensive equity concerns due to this fragmentation of funding and differential care available to different Aboriginal communities.\n\nAs a result, the report suggests that new administration procedures be put in place. Integration of on-reserve healthcare into the current system is not a popular option amongst aboriginal leaders, although serves as a reasonable option for urban aboriginal healthcare. Specifically, the report suggests the formation of Aboriginal Partnerships that are an administrative authority composed of representatives from different levels of government and the aboriginal community.\n\nThese partnerships may work in a method similar to a regional health authority. They will serve as an organization with a specific health goal, such as organizing the public health and primary care for a community. The partnership will be granted federal funds to pursue these health goals in a manner that Partnership executives agree upon. Aboriginal representation in the Partnership ensures that these services are fitting with the cultural needs of the Aboriginal community. Partnerships will also interface with the existing health system to coordinate access to resources such as diagnostics and specialized care.\n\nIn an urban setting, the Partnership will serve as a voluntary health organization that coordinates access to specific health facilities such as primary care and diagnostics. The Partnership will have similar representation from Aboriginal community ensuring that services provided in the urban environment are still sensitive to Aboriginal cultural and linguistic concerns. Partnerships are especially needed in urban settings due to the specific needs of urban Aboriginals for problems such as diabetes and addiction. Furthermore, Partnerships may serve as an additional urban community organization that interfaces with other such Aboriginal organizations to serve as activists for the socioeconomic status of Aboriginals.\n\nAn important point stressed by the Romanow report is that healthcare initiatives must be accountable towards the taxpayer and consumer. Aboriginal health is no different; Partnerships must be closely monitored and their effect on health outcomes determined. Changes in policy may be necessitated as this is a new approach.\n\nThe conclusion of the Report set out 47 recommendations along with a timetable for their implementation.\n\nRecommendation 1 – A new Canadian Health Covenant should be established as a common declaration of Canadians’ and their governments’ commitment to a universally accessible, publicly funded health care system. To this end, First Ministers should meet at the earliest opportunity to agree on this Covenant.\n\nRecommendation 2 – A Health Council of Canada should be established by the provincial, territorial and federal governments to facilitate co-operation and provide national leadership in achieving the best health outcomes in the world.

Not only was his life almost exactly contemporaneous to that of Johann Sebastian Bach, he was the famous composer's cousin.\n\nWalther was most well known as the compiler of the \"Musicalisches Lexicon\" (Leipzig, 1732), an enormous dictionary of music and musicians. Not only was it the first dictionary of musical terms written in the German language, it was the first to contain both terms and biographical information about composers and performers up to the early 18th century. In all, the \"Musicalisches Lexicon\" defines more than 3,000 musical terms; Walther evidently drew on more than 250 separate sources in compiling it, including theoretical treatises of the early Baroque and Renaissance. The single most important source for the work was the writings of Johann Mattheson, who is referenced more than 200 times.\n\nSome further information on Walther can be found in the book \"Musica Poetica\" by Dietrich Bartel. On page 22, Bartel quotes Walther's definition of \"musica poetica\", or musical rhetoric, as:\n\nWalther was the music teacher of Prince Johann Ernst von Sachsen-Weimar. He wrote a handbook for the young prince with the title \"Praecepta der musicalischen Composition\", 1708. It remained handwritten until Peter Benary's edition (Leipzig, 1955). As an organ composer, Walther became famous for his organ transcriptions of orchestral concertos by contemporary Italian and German masters. He made 14 transcriptions of concertos by Albinoni, Gentili, Taglietti, Giuseppe Torelli, Vivaldi and Telemann. These works were the models for Bach to write his famous transcriptions of concertos by Vivaldi and others. On the other hand, Walther as a city organist of Weimar wrote exactly 132 organ preludes based on Lutheran chorale melodies. Some free keyboard music also belongs to his legacy.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1910643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910643", "title": "Kunsan Air Base", "text": "Kunsan Air Base\n\nKunsan K-8 Air Base is a United States Air Force base located at Gunsan Airport, on the west coast of the South Korean peninsula bordered by the Yellow Sea. It is located in the town of Gunsan (also romanized as Kunsan), about south of Seoul.\n\nKunsan Air Base is the home of the 8th Fighter Wing, \"The Wolf Pack,\" assigned to the Pacific Air Forces Seventh Air Force and the 38th Fighter Group of the Republic of Korea Air Force. About 45 F-16 aircraft are stationed at the base. It is one of two major Air Force installations operated by the United States Forces Korea, the other being Osan Air Base.\n\nThe history of Kunsan Air Base dates back to 1938, when Japanese forces occupying Korea built a base near Kunsan for fighter-interceptor aircraft.\n\nThe United States first used the base in 1945, but on a very small scale. From 1945 to 1950, the Army and later the Air Force intermittently operated small detachments from Kunsan, with these detachments maintaining liaison aircraft. At most these detachments contained a handful of people. When the United States pulled its combat units out of the Republic of Korea in 1949, it left only a Military Assistance Advisory Group in the country, and the periodic detachments at Kunsan became even more infrequent.\n\nWhen the Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950, Kunsan Air Base had no United States flying units assigned. In their rapid advance, the invading North Koreans captured Kunsan Air Base on 13 July 1950.\n\nThe 24th Infantry Division retook Kunsan in October 1950, and the Chinese intervention that winter failed to push far enough south to put Kunsan in jeopardy. United States forces first operated in significant numbers from the base in 1951.\n\nThe first USAF unit to be assigned to the base was the 27th Fighter-Escort Wing, which arrived on 1 April 1951. The 27th Fighter Escort Wing was one of the first F-84 Thunderjet units to see combat action in Korea and earned numerous honors and awards for their combat record during the Korean War.\n\nImprovements to the base were needed, however, to accommodate jet fighters. The 27th FEW was reassigned at the end April and the Army's 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion built a runway to replace the sod runway constructed by Japanese. This runway was known as Taxiway Charlie (06/24). By August, construction had progressed to the point that heavier units could be based at Kusan and the USAF assigned the 3rd Bombardment Wing to Kunsan.\n\nThe 3rd Bomb Wing consisting of the 8th, 13th and 90th Bomb Squadrons flew the B-26 Invader bomber during the war, remaining at Kunsan from August 1951 until October 1954. A Marine aviation squadron, VMF(N)-513, arrived in April 1952, and a few months later the base added the 474th Fighter-Bomber Group, which included three squadrons of F-84 fighters, bringing the total size of the operation to one wing, one group, and a Marine fighter squadron. The 474th bombed and strafed such targets as bunkers, troops, artillery positions, bridges, vehicles, airfields, and power plants, and sometimes escorted bombers that attacked munitions factories and other objectives.\n\nIn April 1953, the 474th Fighter-Bomber Group returned to the United States and was replaced by the 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing, also flying the F-84.\n\nDuring the Korean War, the large number of locations used for bases and the similarity of some geographical names prompted the Air Force to use alphanumeric identifiers for bases in addition to their proper designations. Under this system, each base in Korea received a \"K number,\" simplifying positive identification when referring to the various bases. Kunsan received the number K-8, while Osan Air Base was also known as K-55.\n\nAfter hostilities ceased, the base began to draw down. The F-84 forces of the 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing left in November 1953, and by October 1954 the host unit of the base, the 3d Bombardment Wing, also departed. This left the base with a much-reduced mission. From 1953 to 1954, the 808th and 841st Engineering Aviation Battalions constructed what is today's main runway. For the next several years Kunsan merely hosted periodic rotations of fighter and light bomber squadrons, with base facilities maintained and operated by an air base group. During 1957 and 1958 the base hosted squadrons from Japan temporarily. During 1957–8 a Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) F-86 Sabre crashed into the Yellow Sea south of the base after having a flame out and a USAF F-100 Super Sabre crashed in the rice paddies north of the base. The base remained a radar site as a back up during this time to Osan, until the Radar site was turned over to the ROKAF in mid 1958. The Osan detachment on the base also maintained a radio relay site from a hill on the base. Then the base remained relatively dormant, hosting temporary deployments of flying units and serving as a safe haven base for aircraft evacuated from Okinawa and Guam during typhoons. In 1965, the ROKAF assigned a squadron of F-86 fighters to the base. This ROKAF unit was the only permanently assigned flying contingent at Kunsan until after the Pueblo incident in 1968.\n\nAt an unknown date in this time frame, the US Army 38th Air Defense Artillery Brigade assigned Battery B, 6th Battalion, 44th Air Defense Artillery Regiment, a HAWK missile unit to the base. The Tactical Operations site was located on a hill just off the coast, but near the base. Its mission was to defend the base from air attack. The HAWK site and all hardware was turned over to the Korean Army sometime in the early 1990s.\n\nAfter the USS \"Pueblo\" was captured by the North Koreans in January 1968 the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing deployed to Korea on January 25, 1968. Under the command of Col. Jack Hayes F-4D Phantom IIs arrived at Kunsan on January 29, 1968 as part of Operation Combat Fox. In March Col. Hayes was replaced by Col. Chuck Yeager, the 4th remained in Korea until replaced by the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing. The 354th TFW consisting of the Kansas Air National Guard, the Ohio Air National Guard, (ANG) and a few members of the District of Columbia Air National Guard flying the F-100, arrived at Kunsan in July 1968, as part of the buildup of forces in Korea. In 1969 the wing began a transition from the F-100 to the F-4 Phantom. The 354th remained until June 1970, when the base again returned to hosting temporary deployments, such as the four-month activation of the 54th Tactical Fighter Wing from June through October 1970.\n\nThe 3d Tactical Fighter Wing, previously designated the 3d Bombardment Wing, stationed at Kunsan in the early 1950s, arrived in March 1971 to assume control of the base. Like the 354th and 54th, the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing flew the F-4 Phantom. Aircraft came primarily from Misawa AB Japan, 475th Tactical Fighter Wing after it was inactivated and as were most of the personnel initially assigned to the 3rd TFW. When it first activated in May, the wing contained the 35th, 36th and 80th Tactical Fighter Squadron. In September, the 36th TFS transferred to Osan AB.\n\nIn September 1974 the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, the \"Wolf Pack,\" was transferred from Ubon Air Base, Thailand to replace the 3rd at Kunsan. The move took place in name only, as the 8th moved without personnel or equipment, absorbing all assets of the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing. This included the two flying squadrons, which continued to operate as the 35th and 80th Tactical Fighter Squadrons, reuniting the wing with two of its original squadrons.\n\nSince then, the 8th has continued to serve as host unit of Kunsan Air Base, continually improving the base's facilities over the years.\n\nIn February 2018 it was announced that following the completion of construction of hangars and supporting facilities at the base, 12 MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS' will be deployed to Kunsan in March/April 2018.\n\n\n\n\nKunsan has provided support for F-84G Thunderjet, B-26 Invader, F-86 Sabre, RF-100 Super Sabre, RB-57 Canberra, F-100 Super Sabre, F-4 Phantom II, and F-16 Fighting Falcon operations.\n\nFlying and notable non-flying units based at Kunsan Air Base.\n\nUnits marked GSU are Geographically Separate Units, which although based at Kunsan, are subordinate to a parent unit based at another location.\n\nPacific Air Forces (PACAF)\n\n\nAir Mobility Command (AMC)\n\n\nUS Army Pacific (USARPAC)\nEighth Army\n\nAir Force Operations Command\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1910682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910682", "title": "Six Pianos", "text": "Six Pianos\n\nSix Pianos is a minimalist piece for six pianos by the American composer Steve Reich. It was completed in March 1973. He also composed a variation for six marimbas, called \"Six Marimbas\", in 1986. The world première performance of \"Six Pianos\" was in May 1973 at the John Weber Gallery in New York City. The European première took place in January the next year in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nReich's idea was originally for a piece titled \"Piano Store\" that could be played on all the pianos in a piano store. A friend in New York gave him and his fellow musicians access to the Baldwin Piano and Organ Company's premises during evenings, where they could try out ideas. Reich eventually settled on an ensemble of six upright pianos in close proximity, which would allow very precise timing without being masked by the resonance of grand pianos.\n\nThe piece begins with three pianists playing different notes to the same 8-beat rhythmic pattern. Then two more pianists begin to play the same pattern shifted two beats out of phase. (Phasing is a prominent technique in most of Steve Reich's work.) Different phase shifts of the same motifs fade in and out of the ever-changing musical texture for the duration of the piece. The piece also uses the additive technique of gradually building up parts by substituting notes for rests, and the opposite. \"Six Pianos\" is also notable by being one of Reich's only pieces in duple time.\n\n\"Six Pianos\" has three sections, separated by relatively sudden changes of tonal center, though they all use the same seven pitch classes of the D major diatonic scale. The first section is in D major, with the tonality anchored in place by a persistent pattern of D and A in the bass. Then that pattern slowly fades out, leaving a B minor tonality which serves as a short transition to the second section in E Dorian. A sudden transition leads to the third section in B natural minor. \"Six Marimbas\" follows the same structure, but is transposed down by one semitone so that the piece opens in D flat major and concludes in B flat natural minor.\n\n\"Six Marimbas Counterpoint\" is a version of \"Six Marimbas\" arranged by the Japanese percussionist Kuniko in which one live marimba plays against five pre-recorded marimbas. A recorded version was included in her 2010 album of Reich pieces, \"Kuniko Plays Reich\".\n\n\"Piano Counterpoint\" is an arrangement of \"Six Pianos\" by the pianist Vincent Corver, following the format of Reich's \"Counterpoint\" series in which one live instrument plays against pre-recorded versions of the same instrument. This arrangement has four pre-recorded parts and one solo part, combining the two foreground melodic parts of \"Six Pianos\". \"Piano Counterpoint\"'s sonic difference from the original comes from the use of amplification and from the solo part in which some of the melodic phrases are an octave higher. Corver created this arrangement in 2011. \"Piano Counterpoint\" is performed by Corver himself on an album released by the London Steve Reich Ensemble in 2011 and by Vicky Chow (known as pianist in the Bang on a Can All Stars) in an album released in 2014. Chow played the piece at a somewhat slower tempo to give a different feel to Corver's version.\n\nFolkwang University of the Arts professor Mie Miki adapted the piece for accordions: the resulting \"Six Accordions\" premièred in Tokyo in 2010.\n\nAmerican DJ Kerri Chandler released a house-music track called \"Six Pianos\" that interpolates the Reich piece.\n\nThe original version of the piece was recorded in Hamburg (Rahlstedt), Musikstudio 1, in January 1974.

{"id": "1910683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910683", "title": "Camelina sativa", "text": "Camelina sativa\n\nCamelina sativa is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae and is usually known in English as camelina, gold-of-pleasure, or false flax, also occasionally wild flax, linseed dodder, German sesame, and Siberian oilseed. It is native to Europe and to Central Asian areas. This plant is cultivated as oilseed crop mainly in Europe and in North America.\n\nAs a summer or winter annual plant, camelina grows to heights of , with branching stems which become woody at maturity. The leaves are alternate on the stem, lanceolate with a length from and a width of . Leaves and stems may be partially hairy. It blooms in the UK, between June and July. Its abundant, four-petaled flowers are pale yellow in colour, and cross-shaped. Later, it produces a fruit which is pear shaped with a short beak. The seeds are brown, or orange in colour and a length of . The 1,000-seed weight ranges from .\n\nToday, camelina is found, wild or cultivated, in almost all regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, but also in South America, Australia, and New Zealand. Camelina seems to be particularly adapted to cold semiarid climate zone (steppes and prairies).\n\n\"C. sativa\" has been traditionally cultivated as an oilseed crop to produce vegetable oil and animal feed. Ample archeological evidence shows it has been grown in Europe for at least 3,000 years. The earliest findsites include the Neolithic levels at Auvernier, Switzerland (dated to the second millennium BC), the Chalcolithic level at Pefkakia in Greece (dated to the third millennium BC), and Sucidava-Celei, Romania (\"circa\" 2200 BC). During the Bronze Age and Iron Age, it was an important agricultural crop in northern Greece beyond the current range of the olive. It was also found in Denmark, and during the Stone Age in Hungary. It apparently continued to be grown at the time of the Roman Empire, although its Greek and Latin names are not known. As early as 600 BC, it was being sown as a monoculture around the Rhine River Valley, and was thought to have spread mainly by coexisting as a weed with flax monocultures.\n\nUntil the 1940s, camelina was an important oil crop in eastern and central Europe, and currently has continued to be cultivated in a few parts of Europe for its seed oil. Camelina oil was used in oil lamps (until the modern harnessing of natural gas, propane, and electricity) and as an edible oil (Camelina oil, also referred to as wild flax or false flax oil). It was possibly brought to North America unintentionally as a weed with flaxseed, and has had limited commercial importance until modern times. Currently, the breeding potential is unexplored compared to other oilseeds commercially grown around the world.\n\nIt has many uses; including the stem fibres used for brushes, the seed oil for cosmetics or burnt in lamps. Herbalists also used the oil in herbal medicine.\n\nThe edible seeds can be sprinkled on salads or mixed with water to produce an egg substitute.\n\nThe crop is now being researched due to its exceptionally high level (up to 45%) of omega-3 fatty acids, which is uncommon in vegetable sources. Seeds contain 38 to 43% oil and 27 to 32% protein. Over 50% of the fatty acids in cold-pressed camelina oil are polyunsaturated. The oil is also very rich in natural antioxidants, such as tocopherols, making this highly stable oil very resistant to oxidation and rancidity. It has 1–3% erucic acid; recently, several low-erucic and zero-erucic Camelina Sativa varieties (with erucic acid content of less than 1%) have been introduced. The vitamin E content of camelina oil is approximately 110 mg/100 g. It is well suited for use as a cooking oil as it has an almond-like flavor and aroma.\n\nThe US state of Montana has recently been growing more camelina for its potential as a biofuel and biolubricant. Plant scientists at the University of Idaho, Washington State University, and other institutions also are studying this emerging biodiesel.\n\nStudies have shown camelina-based jet fuel reduces net carbon emissions by about 80%. The United States Navy chose it as the feedstock for their first test of aviation biofuel, and successfully operated a static F414 engine (used in the F/A-18 Hornet and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet) in October 2009 at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. The United States Air Force also began testing the fuel in its aircraft in March 2010. On 22 April 2010, the U.S. Navy observed Earth Day by conducting a flight test lasting about 45 minutes at Naval Air Station Patuxent River of an F/A-18 Super Hornet – nicknamed the \"Green Hornet\" – powered by a 50/50 blend of conventional jet fuel and a biofuel made from camelina; the flight was the first of a planned 15 test flights totaling about 23 flight-hours, scheduled for completion by mid-June 2010. In March 2011, the U.S. Air Force successfully tested a 50/50 mix of jet propellant 8 (JP-8) and camelina-derived biofuel in an F-22 Raptor, achieving a speed of Mach 1.5 on 18 March 2011. On September 4, 2011, the U.S. Navy's Blue Angels flight demonstration squadron used a 50/50 blend of camelina biofuel and jet fuel at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River Air Expo, the first time an entire military aviation unit flew on a biofuel mix. In 2011, the U.S. Navy announced plans to deploy a \"Great Green Fleet,\" a carrier battle group powered entirely by nonfossil fuels, by 2016. By 2016, the U.S. Air Force wants 50% of the fuel it consumes to be from biofuels.\n\nContinental Airlines, was the first commercial airline to test a 50:50 blend of bio-derived “green jet” fuel and traditional jet fuel in the first demonstration of the use of sustainable biofuel to power a commercial aircraft in North America.( January 2009). The demonstration flight, conducted in partnership with Boeing, GE Aviation/CFM International, and Honeywell’s UOP, marked the first sustainable biofuel demonstration flight by a commercial carrier using a two-engine aircraft: a Boeing 737-800 equipped with CFM International CFM56-7B engines. Continental ran the blend in Engine No. 2. During the two-hour test flight, Continental pilots engaged the aircraft in a number of normal and non-normal flight maneuvers, such as mid-flight engine shutdown and restart, and power accelerations and decelerations. A Continental engineer recorded flight data on board. KLM, the Royal Dutch Airline, was the first airline to operate a passenger-carrying flight using biofuel. On 23 November 2009, a Boeing 747 flew, carrying a limited number of passengers, with one of its four engines running on a 50/50 mix of biofuel and kerosene.\n\nIn June 2011, a Gulfstream G450 became the first business jet to cross the Atlantic Ocean using a blend of 50/50 biofuel developed by Honeywell derived from camelina and petroleum-based jet fuel.\nThe Dutch biofarming company Waterland International and a Japanese federation of farmers made an agreement in March 2012 to plant and grow camelina on 2000 to 3000 ha in Fukushima Prefecture. The seeds were to be used to produce biofuel, that could be used to produce electricity. According to director William Nolten, the region had a big potential for the production of clean energy. Some 800.000 ha in the region could not be used to produce food anymore, and after the nuclear disaster because of fears for contamination, the Japanese people refused to buy food produced in the region, anyway. Experiments would be done to find out whether camelina was capable of extracting radioactive caesium from the soil. An experiment with sunflowers had no success.\n\nCamelina has been approved as a cattle feed supplement in the US, as well as an ingredient (up to 10% of the ration) in broiler chicken feed and laying hen feed. Camelina meal, the byproduct of camelina when the oil has been extracted, has a significant crude protein content. \"Feeding camelina meal significantly increased (p < 0.01) omega-3 [fatty acid] concentration in both breast and thigh meat [of turkeys] compared to control group.\" Medical research indicates a diet abundant in omega-3 fatty acids is beneficial to human health. Camelina oil has also been investigated as a sustainable lipid source to fully replace fish oil in diets for farmed Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, and Atlantic cod. However, various antinutritional factors are present in camelina oil meal and can affect its use as livestock feed. The use of camelina meal for animal feed is only limited by the presence of glucosinolates.\n\nThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency has approved feeding cold-pressed non-solvent extracted Camelina meal to broiler chickens at up to 12% inclusion.\n\nApproximately 50,000 acres are currently cultivated in Canada. The Camelina Association of Canada projects Canada estimates that 1 to 3 million acres could be planted in the future. Several factors challenge the spread of camelina cultivation in Canada: it does not have government crop classification, and camelina meal is not approved as livestock feed. In early 2010, Health Canada approved camelina oil as a food in Canada.\n\nIn 2014, camelina was included for the first time in Canada's Advance Payments Program (APP), commonly known as the cash advance program.\n\nThe first full genome sequence for Camelina was released on August 1, 2013, by a Canadian research team. The genome sequence and its annotation are available in a genome viewer format and enabled for sequence searching and alignment. Technical details of Camelina's genome sequence were published on April 23, 2014 in the academic journal Nature Communications.\n\nIn 2013 Rothamsted Research in the UK reported they had developed a genetically modified form of Camelina sativa that produced Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA and DHA are omega-3 fatty acids which are beneficial for cardiovascular health. The main source of these omega-3 fatty acids is fish but supplies are limited and unsustainable.\n\nCamelina is a short-season crop (85–100 days) and grows well in the temperate climate zone in light or medium soils. Camelina is generally seeded in spring from March to May, but can also be seeded in fall in mild climates.\n\nA seeding rate of 3–4 kg/ha is recommended, with an row interval of 12 to 20 cm. Seeding depth should not exceed 1 cm. With high seeding rates, these independently noncompetitive seedlings become competitive against weeds because of their density. The seedlings are early emerging and can withstand mild frosts in the spring. Minimal seedbed preparation is needed to establish camelina.\n\nUsually, camelina does not need any field interventions. However, perennial weeds may be difficult to control. Some specialized oilseed herbicides can be used on it. Also, camelina is highly resistant to black leg and \"Alternaria brassicae\", but it can be susceptible to sclerotinia stem rot. No insect has been found to cause economic damage to camelina. Camelina needs little water or nitrogen to flourish; it can be grown on marginal agricultural lands. Fertilization requirements depend on soils, but are generally low. It may be used as a rotation crop for wheat and other cereals, to increase the health of the soil. Camelina can also show some allelopathic traits, and it can be grown in mixed crop with cereals or legumes.\n\nCamelina is harvested and seeded with conventional farming equipment, which makes adding it to a crop rotation relatively easy for farmers who do not already grow it.\n\nSeed yields vary depending on conditions and can reach 2700 kg/ha (2400 lb/acre).\n\nNorth America: 'Blaine Creek', 'Suneson', 'Platte', 'Cheyenne', 'SO-40', 'SO-50', 'SO-60'\n\nEurope: 'Epona', 'Celine', 'Calena', 'Lindo', 'Madonna', 'Konto','D.Tagliafierro'\n\n\"C. sativa\" subsp. \"linicola\" is considered a weed in flax fields. In fact, attempts to separate its seed from flax seeds with a winnowing machine over the years have selected for seeds which are similar in size to flax seeds, an example of Vavilovian mimicry.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1910687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910687", "title": "Basil Mott", "text": "Basil Mott\n\nSir Basil Mott, 1st Baronet FRS (16 September 1859 – 7 September 1938) was one of the most notable English civil engineers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was responsible for some of the most innovative work on tunnels and bridges in the United Kingdom in the 40-year period centred on World War I.\n\nBasil Mott was born in Leicester on 16 September 1859. He was educated at the International School, Switzerland and at the Royal School of Mines where he won the Murchison medal in 1879. He was first employed as a mining engineer with the Neston Colliery Co. in Cheshire but in 1886 was invited by J H Greathead to join the staff of the City & South London Railway (C&SLR), for which Greathead was Engineer. His work on the C&SLR gave him a taste for underground construction works that influenced the remaining 40 years of his professional life.\n\nHe did well at the C&SLR and was promoted, first to resident engineer (RE) for the extension of the C&SLR from Stockwell to Clapham, then to RE for the entire line. After the railway opened in 1890, he was retained as Engineer by the operating company: this gave him the opportunity to develop techniques for carrying out reconstruction works during overnight possessions of the tunnels, techniques which are still used on LU today.\n\nShortly after Greathead's death in October 1896, Benjamin Baker formed a partnership with Mott for the design of the Central London Railway. Their association continued with the extensions and rebuilding on the C&SLR (including the underpinning of St Mary Woolnoth church at Bank) and the widening of Blackfriars Bridge. They worked from the same offices until Baker's death in 1907.\n\n1n 1902, Mott formed what turned out to be a lifelong partnership with another protégé of Baker's, David Hay. Subsequently, the partnership of Mott and Hay (now Mott MacDonald) worked on extending the Central London Railway, the building of escalators in London Underground and the construction of the Tyne and Southwark Bridges. It also designed the underpinning required to stabilise Clifford's Tower in York.\n\nDuring the first world war, Basil Mott visited France and India, advising the government on solving engineering problems. He was created a Companion of the Bath (CB) in 1918 in recognition of these services.\n\nThe Mersey Tunnel, which he worked on between 1922 and 1934, is his most well-known work. From the outset, it was designed on a large scale; it is still the longest, widest road tunnel in Great Britain. Basil Mott was Engineer for the works, in association with J. A. Brodie, Engineer for the City of Liverpool. His partnership (by then named Mott, Hay and Anderson) designed and supervised the construction of the Mersey Tunnel in its entirety.\n\nIn 1924, he was elected President of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n\nIn 1926 he was hired by Southampton council to investigate the various options for building a fixed crossing across the lower River Itchen. Along with proving costs for a tunnel and a high level crossing he recommended a low level opening span bridge.\n\nBasil Mott's other post-WW1 works include the extension to Morden of the Northern line, the enlargement of the original C&SLR tunnels from 10' 6\" to 11' 8\" (using a tunnelling shield which could be worked at night but through which trains could drive during the day), the Jubilee Bridge and work on the Tees Newport Bridge.\n\nIn 1930, aged 71, he gave evidence to a British government inquiry on the engineering aspects of a proposed Channel Tunnel (which was not built, though Mott, Hay and Anderson designed the bulk of the successful scheme for Channel Tunnel half a century later). In the same year he was created a baronet.\n\nIn May 1932 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society—a rare honour for a civil engineer.\n\nHe died on 7 September 1938, in London. The baronetcy is currently held by his grandson, John Mott.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "1910704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910704", "title": "Nahavand", "text": "Nahavand\n\nNahavand (, also Romanized as Nahāvand and Nehāvend) is a city and capital of Nahavand County, Hamadan Province, Iran. At the 2006 census, its population was 72,218, in 19,419 families. It is located south of Hamadan, east of Malayer and northwest of Borujerd. Occupied since prehistoric times, Nahavand was bestowed upon the House of Karen in the Sasanian period. During the Arab conquest of Iran, it was the site of the famous Battle of Nahavand.\n\nThe name \"Nahāvand\" is probably ultimately derived from Old Persian \"*Niθāvanta-\", related to the Old Persian name \"Nisāya\", itself derived from the prefix \"ni-\", meaning \"down\" and a second element which is related to Avestan \"si\" or \"say\", meaning \"to lie down\".\n\nIt has been spelled differently in different books and sources:\nNahavand, Nahavend, Nahawand, Nahaavand, Nihavand, Nehavand, Nihavend, or Nehavend, formerly called Mah-Nahavand, and in antiquity Laodicea (; Arabic Ladhiqiyya), also transliterated Laodiceia and Laodikeia, Laodicea in Media, Laodicea in Persis, Antiochia in Persis, Antiochia of Chosroes (), Antiochia in Media (), Nemavand and Niphaunda.\n\nNahavand is located in western Iran, in the northern part of the Zagros region. It lies kilometers south of Hamadan, from which it is separated by the massif of the Alvand subrange. This massif grants Nahavand and its hinterlands an abudant water supply. Historically, Nahavand was located on a route that led from central Iraq through Kermanshah to northern Iran, and was therefore often crossed by armies. Another historic road, coming from Kermanshah, leads towards Isfahan in central Iran and avoids the Alvand massif. Nahavand also lies on the branch of the Gamasab river which comes from the southeast from the vicinity of Borujerd; from Nahavand the Gamasab river flows westwards to Mount Behistun. Given Nahavand's location, it was the site of several battles, and was considered important in Iranian history during Iran's wars with its western neighbors.\n\nExcavations conducted in 1931/2 at Tepe Giyan by Georges Contenau and Roman Ghirshman led to the conclusion that Nahavand and its environs have been inhabited since prehistoric times. It showed that the site of Tepe Giyan, which lies kilometers southeast of Nahavand, was occupied since at least 5,000 BC to BC.\n\nDuring the Achaemenid period (550–330 BC), Nahavand was located in the southernmost part of Media, on the fertile Nisaean plain. Strabo wrote that it was \"(re-)founded\" by Achaemenid King Xerxes the Great (486–465 BC). It lay kilometers from Ecbatana (modern-day Hamadan), on the trunk road from Babylonia through Media to Bactria. In the Seleucid period, Nahavand was turned into a Greek \"polis\" with magistrates and a Seleucid governor. In the 20th century, a stone stele was found near Nahavand. The stele bore an inscription of Seleucid ruler Antiochus III the Great (222–187 BC), introducing the cult he had created for his wife Queen Laodice III. The stele, dated to 193 BC, revealed the \"terminus ante quem\" of the foundation of the Greek \"polis\". According to Abu Hanifa Dinawari, who flourished in the 9th century, in the Parthian period, Nahavand was the seat of the Parthian prince Artabanus, who later reigned as Artabanus I of Parthia (127-124/3 BC). During the Sasanian period, the district of Nahavand was bestowed upon the House of Karen. There was also a fire temple.\n\nIn 642, during the Arab conquest of Iran, a famous battle was fought at Nahavand. With heavy losses on both sides, it eventually resulted in a Sasanian defeat, and as such, opened up the doors of the Iranian plateau to the invaders. In the early Islamic period, Nahavand flourished as part of the province of Jibal. It first functioned as administrative center of the Mah al-Basra (\"Media of the Basrans\") district. Its revenues were reportedly used for the payment of the troops from Basra that were stationed in Nahavand. Medieval geographers mention Nahavand as an affluent commercial hub with two Friday mosques. When the 10th century Arab traveller Abu Dulaf travelled through Nahavand he noted \"fine remains of the [ancient] Persians\". Abu Dulaf also wrote that during the reign of Caliph al-Ma'mun (813–833), a treasure chamber had been found, containing two gold caskets.\n\nIn the course of the subsequent centuries, only few events in Nahavand were recorded. The Persian vizier of the Seljuk Empire, Nizam al-Mulk, was assassinated in 1092 near Nahavand. According to Hamdallah Mustawfi, who flourished in the 13th and 14th centuries, Nahavand was a town of medium size surrounded by fertile fields where corn, cotton and fruits were grown. Mustawfi added that its inhabitants were mainly Twelver Shia Kurds.\n\nIn 1589, during the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578-1590, Ottoman General Cığalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha built a fortress at Nahavand for future campaigns against Safavid Iran. By the Treaty of Constantinople (1590), the Safavids were forced to cede the city to the Turks. In 1602/3, Nahavand's citizens revolted against the Ottoman occupiers. Coinciding with the Celali revolts in Anatolia, the Safavids recaptured Nahavand and expelled the Ottomans from the city, thus restoring Iranian control. The Safavid governor of Hamadan, Hasan Khan Ustajlu, subsequently destroyed the Ottoman fort. In the wake of the collapse of the Safavids in 1722, the Turks captured Nahavand once more. In 1730, they were ousted by Nader-Qoli Beg (later known as Nader Shah; 1736–1747). Nader's death in 1747 led to instability. Over the next few years, Nahavand was exploited by local Bakhtiari chiefs. In , Karim Khan Zand defeated the Bakhtiari chieftain Ali Mardan Khan Bakhtiari at Nahavand.\n\n\nNahavand also gives its name to the musical mode (maqam) \"Nahawand\" in Arabic, Persian and Turkish music. This mode is known for its wide variety of Western sounding melodies.\n\n\n\n"}

Capital Combat took place on May 19, 1990, at the D.C. Armory in Washington, D.C. The show featured a promotional crossover with the imminent release of \"RoboCop 2\", with RoboCop rescuing Sting from an attack by the Four Horsemen during the PPV.\n\nThe main event of the show was a steel cage match with Ric Flair defending the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Lex Luger. On the undercard, The Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner) defended the NWA World Tag Team Championship against Doom (Ron Simmons and Butch Reed) while Brian Pillman and Tom Zenk defended the NWA United States Tag Team Championship against the Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane). The show included five additional matches.\n\nIn 1989, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) held their first pay-per-view (PPV) in May when they held the first WrestleWar event. In 1990, WrestleWar was held in February, with WCW instead opting to hold a different event in May. This PPV event, held at the D.C. Armory in Washington, D.C., was named \"Capital Combat\" in light of it being held in the United States capital city. Due to a printing error on the tickets, the starting time for the show was listed as 8 PM, not 7 PM which was the actual bell time for the first match leading to the first couple of matches taking place in front of a half-full arena. The event ended up drawing 7,500 paid spectators, not quite filling the 10,000 seat arena but close to capacity since part of the seats were blocked by the sets and ring ramp. The first three matches on the show were not included when Turner Home Entertainment later released the show on VHS cassette, editing the show down to fit a two-hour format. The first three matches were not made available to the general public until the WWE Network was launched in 2014 and the full Capital Combat show became available to subscribers.\n\nWCW had originally intended to have the Samoan Swat Team (Fatu and Samu) wrestle for the NWA United States Tag Team Championship, facing champions Flyin' Brian Pillman and \"Z-Man\" Tom Zenk at the show. When the Samoan Swat Team did not show up for the television taping on April 9 where they were supposed to film the beginnings of the storyline that would lead to the match WCW replaced them with The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane) instead.\n\nThe event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\n\nThe main storyline leading up to Capital Combat, and the main storyline in WCW at the time revolved around Four Horsemen stable and the Faces (those that portray the \"good guys\") of WCW. At Clash of the Champions X on February 6, 1990, the Four Horsemen (Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, and Ole Anderson) turned on Sting, attacking him and kicking him out of the Horsemen because he accepted an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match against Ric Flair. In the ensuing fight Sting suffered a knee injury which required surgery. Due to the injury, the plans for WCW's 1990 WrestleWar PPV had to be changed drastically, with NWA United States Champion Lex Luger, a former friend of Sting's, receiving the championship match instead. During the main event, Luger had Flair locked in his submission hold, looking like he was about to win the match and the championship. At that point the Andersons cornered Sting, who was on crutches after his surgery, threatening to injure him even further. At that point Luger abandoned the match, opting to save his long time friend instead even though it cost him the match and the championship. In the weeks following WrestleWar WCW officials announced that Lex Luger would receive another opportunity to wrestle for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of Capital Combat, this time in a steel cage match to prevent the Four Horsemen from interfering. In the weeks leading up to Capital Combat, the Horsemen introduced both Barry Windham and Sid Vicious as part of their group, with Ole Anderson acting more as a manager from that point on.\n\nJim Ross and Bob Caudle served as the announcers for the match while Tony Schiavone and Gordon Solie providing additional on screen announcing, either from backstage or in the ring. For the first match of the night, both members of the Road Warriors (Animal and Hawk) were driven to the ring on the back of Harley Davidson motorcycles while their tag team partner Norman came out on a Kick scooter to the ring. The six-man tag team match against Kevin Sullivan, Cactus Jack and Bam Bam Bigelow ended when Road Warrior Hawk leaped off the top rope, striking Kevin Sullivan with a flying clothesline, resulting in a pinfall victory for the team.\n\nTeddy Long accompanied \"Mean\" Mark Callous to the ring for the second match, despite being scheduled to wrestle himself later in the night. The match against Johnny Ace ended after just over 10 minutes of wrestling when Callous hit Johnny Ace with a Heart Punch, followed by the Callous climbing the turnbuckles, then walking across the top rope to land an elbow drop on Ace to win the match. In the third match of the night the Samoan Swat Team (Fatu and Samoan Savage) defeated the team of Tommy Rich and Mike Rotunda in 17 minutes and 55 seconds.\n\nThe fourth match of the night carried a special stipulation, the loser of the match would be shaved bald as a result. Managers Theodore R. Long and Paul Ellering faced off in the special attraction match. Long came to the ring wearing boxing gloves, boxing headgear and was announced as \"Sugar Ray\" Long. During the opening moments of the match, Long hit Ellering with one of his gloves, with Ellering selling the impact like the glove was loaded. Moments later Ellering took the glove away from Long, then hit Long with his own glove to knock him out. Three seconds later and Theodore R. Long was forced to have his hair shaved off by hairstylist Jay Tapper who was at ringside. Manager Jim Cornette was forced to be confined in a steel cage located at ringside while his team, the Midnight Express, wrestled against Brian Pillman and Tom Zenk. With Cornette locked in the cage, he was unable to help his team or get physically involved like he normally would. The over 20 minute long match ended after Stan Lane kicked Zenk in the back of the head, sending him into an inside cradle pinning hold by Bobby Eaton to secure the victory and the championship.\n\nAfter the United States Tag Team Championship match Gordon Solie reported from backstage that RoboCop had arrived at the building, followed by RoboCop and Sting entering the arena moments later. During the segment the Four Horsemen came to ringside to attack Sting, locking him in the steel cage that Jim Cornette had been confined to earlier in the night. Moments later RoboCop ran off the Horsemen and then pulled the door off the steel cage to release Sting. The sixth match of the night, a tag team match between The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) and The Freebirds (Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin) was billed as a \"Corporal Punishment\" match. The \"Corporal Punishment\" stipulation meant that each team was given a three-foot-long leather strap they were allowed to use during the match. The straps themselves were not widely used during the match as both teams opted to wrestle the match as a straight match with only a few moments of actual whipping. In the end, Morton rolled up Michael Hayes to win the match.\n\nWhen Theodore Long returned to the arena after his earlier loss he had his head covered by a bandana to hide the fact that he had all his hair shaved off. Long played a very minor role in the match as his team of Doom (Ron Simmons and Butch Reed) wrestled the NWA World Tag Team Champions The Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner) for the championship. The match ended with a victory for Doom in 19 minutes and 13 seconds after Simmons hit Rick Steiner in the back, allowing Reed to pin Steiner for the victory and the championship.\n\nThe steel cage used for the main event was not the traditional type of cage that was attached to the actual ring itself, but was oversized and stood on the floor around the ring without a door to ensure no one could get in or out once the cage had been lowered in place. Flair was accompanied by the Horsemen's manager Woman who was allowed inside the cage. During the referee's pre-match check he discovered that Woman had an illegal object hidden in her glove, which he proceeded to confiscate prior to the match starting and ejected her from the cage. Late in the match, Luger had Flair in a vulnerable position as he had the champion locked in his Torture Rack submission hold. At that point of the match, the cage was raised up enough for Barry Windham to enter the ring and attack Luger to cause a disqualification, allowing Flair to remain champion. Moments later Sting came back to the arena to help fight off the Four Horsemen, soon joined by the tall El Gigante who was making his first appearance on a WCW show.\n\nThe segment with RoboCop saving Sting has often been cited as one of the worst moments in WCW's history and one of the events that inspired the creation of the \"WrestleCrap\" website. Later reviews of the event covered the Turner Home Video version that did not include the first three matches, something one reviewer described as \"leave[ing] two hours of good matches\". In a 2008 review J.D. Dunn rated the event as 8.5 out of 10, stating \"Most people remember this for the laughable Robocop segments, but the wrestling was stellar on this show\". The main event match was later included in WWE's \"The Greatest Cage Matches of All Time\" DVD that was released in 2011\n\nAfter recovering from his knee injury Sting received his championship match against Ric Flair at the 1990 Great American Bash where Sting won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship for the first time. Sting, Luger, El Gigante and others continued the feud with the Four Horsemen over the next year, ending in 1991 when the Four Horsemen disbanded as Ric Flair (at the time the first WCW World Heavyweight Champion) and Sid Vicious left WCW. Ric Flair left due to a contract dispute with Jim Herd (Booker at the time), along with the fact that Herd wanted Flair to cut his hair, wear a diamond earring, and call himself Spartacus. This was the reason when Flair showed up in the WWF shortly thereafter he had short hair. Ric Flair also took the WCW World Championship with him to the WWF, proclaiming himself the “Real World Heavyweight Champion”. The reason he did this was when a champion held a title belt, they had to put a cash deposit down on the belt while champion, and when Jim Herd didn’t renew Flair’s contract, he never repaid him the deposit Flair put down on the WCW World Championship. Therefore, since Flair never received his deposit back, he technically owned the belt, and took it with him to the WWF in the fall of 1991. Because of this, Jim Herd declared the WCW World Championship vacant, and held a match at The Great American Bash between the two top contenders for the now vacant World Title between the current United States Heavyweight Champion Lex Luger and Barry Windham, resulting in a double turn where Luger won the WCW World Championship under nefarious means, becoming a heel in the process, while Barry Windham became a Babyface.\n\nThe PPV was the last televised match for Johnny Ace. Ace would later work for All Japan Pro Wrestling and after retiring from in-ring competition, end up working behind the scenes and on-screen in WWE under his real name, John Laurinaitis.\n\n"}

{"id": "1910732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910732", "title": "Newport (cigarette)", "text": "Newport (cigarette)\n\nNewport is an American brand of menthol cigarettes, currently owned and manufactured by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The brand was originally named for the seaport of Newport, Rhode Island. It is the best-selling brand of menthols in the world.\n\nNewport was originally launched in 1957 by the Lorillard Tobacco Company. The cigarette originated within Ireland and was introduced to the culture mostly for the male drinkers of the time. The spinnaker present on all packs since the late 1950s is meant to capitalize on the association with sailing. \n\nThe original Newport had a white filter and a hint of mint; both were gone in 1969 and thus the white filter was replaced by a standard filter. The Newport Classic full flavor cigarettes were promoted for many years as a cigarette that allows you to \"\"Enjoy a full flavor menthol, without drowning out pure tobacco taste\"\". \n\nIn the mid-1980s, Newport began an advertising campaign that targeted African Americans in urban areas. In two years, Newport became the fifth most popular cigarette on the market. Because of this, Newports have gained a commanding share of the African-American market; a 2005 survey stated that 49.5% of all cigarette sales to African-Americans were Newport cigarettes. Newport has been the second best selling cigarette brand in the United States since 1996, trailing only Altria's Marlboro brand.\n\nA 2004 study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that the percentage of teen Newport smokers doubled between 1989 and 1996. Researcher Karen Gerlach indicated that Newports made the most significant progress with the Hispanic and White American teen markets in those years. A 1998 Massachusetts Department of Public Health report indicated that Newports alongside unfiltered Camel cigarettes contained the highest levels of nicotine in cigarettes on the market. In the following six years, Lorillard Tobacco increased the amount of nicotine in Newports by 10%.\n\nIn 2015, the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company acquired Newport and the entire Lorillard Tobacco Company for $27.4 billion. \n\nNewports comprise about 35 percent of menthol cigarette sales in the U.S. It has been the most popular mentholated cigarette brand sold in the United States since 1993.\n\nLorillard advertised Newport in various ways. TV advertisements were created in the 1960s and 1970s to promote the brand.\n\nOnce TV adverts were banned in the United States, Lorillard advertised the brand through poster advertisements. The Newport ads in this theme range from 1980 to present day and feature the \"\"Newport Pleasure\"\" or \"\"Alive with Pleasure\"\" campaign slogans. The latter slogan provides the viewer with a subconscious health claim. Additionally, the pleasure aspect of these campaigns weighs an important part of youth targeting, portraying Newports as fun and enjoyable and, subconsciously, sexy and sexual.\n\nNewport is mainly sold in the United States, but also was or still is sold in Antigua British Virgin Islands, Luxembourg, Finland and Singapore.\n\nA lawsuit against the Lorillard Tobacco Company alleged that in the late 1960s, company vans were used to make regular trips to housing projects where free Newport cigarettes were given to children.\nEvidence showed that the deceased plaintiff died of lung cancer, but that she started smoking at age nine after receiving free Newport cigarettes near the black playground in Boston. \nThe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld $35 million of damages against Lorillard Tobacco Company while reversing other issues of damages.\n\nIn the 1960s, Lorillard specifically targeted African Americans to sell Newport cigarettes. \n\nLorillard increased its African American market budget by 87% over 1968 due to increased efforts marketing its menthol cigarette, Newport, to the African American market. Government surveys in 2011 revealed that menthol cigarettes dominated 30% of the overall market, and over 80% of black smokers prefer menthol as opposed to 22% of non-Hispanic white smokers. In 2016, it was reported that Newport was the brand of choice for nearly 60% of black smokers.\n\nIn September 2016, it was reported that R.J. Reynolds was specifically targeting black teenagers and young adults to sell Newport cigarettes.\n\nReynolds American Inc., the parent firm that owns Newport, was pushing the brand on people in their 20s — with pop-ups at music festivals like Las Vegas' Electric Daisy Carnival, a notorious destination for teen-partiers, which was recently pressured to raise its age requirements. Dubbed \"\"Newport Pleasure Lounges\"\", the air-conditioned party trucks were replete with games like digital darts. Newports could be purchased in these lounges for $1 per pack. Reynolds had set aside $50 million for such initiatives in 2016.\n\nA study from the Stanford University School of Medicine had discovered that menthol cigarette manufacturers created very direct marketing campaigns designed to attract young black smokers. Far from being a catchall effort, Reuters says these campaigns were concerted attacks on African-American teens: \"\"A recent analysis of the data found school neighborhoods were increasingly likely to have lower prices and more advertising for Newport cigarettes as the proportion of African-American students rose. The same was true of neighborhoods with higher proportions of children aged 10 to 17.\"\"\n\nIn May 2010, a report was written where the popular sport shoe company Nike copied the Swoosh logo from Newport. The comparison was made, because Newport was introduced in 1957 and used a logo they call the \"\"spinnaker\"\", while Nike was formed on January 25, 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports by Bill Bowerman and Philip Knight, and officially became Nike, Inc. in 1978. The Nike swoosh is a logo design created in 1971 by Carolyn Davidson, over a decade after Newport cigarettes were launched.\n\nDespite some claims, no specific evidence has ever been found that Nike stole the logo from Newport.\n\nIn 2006, Lorillard and Nike sued graphic designer Ari Saal Forman after he released his Ari Menthol 10s shoes, which combined the design of the Nike Air Force 1 with Newport's spinnaker and colors. According to Forman, the shoes were \"dedicated to the two brands who have taken the most and given the least.\" As a result of the lawsuit, Forman is not legally allowed to own a pair of Menthol 10s.\n\nIn December 2016, it was reported that R.J. Reynolds would start selling marijuana cigarettes called \"\"Newport Nirvana\"\".\n\nHowever, Newport did not develop marijuana cigarettes which would be available for purchase in 2017. In November 2016, a site called \"TMZWorldNews\" published an article reporting that the cigarette brand Newport planned to introduce marijuana cigarettes dubbed the \"\"Newport Nirvana\"\". However, Snopes reported that \"TMZWorldNews\" is a fake news website appropriating the combined brandings of popular gossip site \"TMZ\" and the national newscast \"ABC World News Tonight\". None included a disclaimer warning readers its content consisted entirely of falsehoods.\n\nNewport cigarettes come in several varieties: Full Flavor, Medium, and Lights. In the United States, in June 2010, \"Medium\" and \"Lights\" were re-branded into \"Blue\" and \"Gold\" respectively. On the box, the words \"Menthol Box\" for shorts and \"Menthol Box 100s\" for 100s were replaced simply with \"Cigarettes.\" Each variety is sold in 85mm soft packs (king size), 80mm hard packs (box), and 100mm soft and hard packs. They are available in standard packs of 20 cigarettes, as well as the more unusual 25s, containing 25 cigarettes. Prior to the signing of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement in the late 1990s, they were sold in packs of ten as well.\n\nDue to the FDA Tobacco Regulations, the terms \"Full Flavor,\" \"Medium,\" \"Light,\" \"Mild\" and \"Ultra Light\" have been discontinued. New names for Newport Cigarettes are as follows:\n\n\nNon-menthol Newports in Full Flavor and Lights were sold in United States during the mid- to late 1990s, possibly as late as 2002; however, they were discontinued until November 2010 in which they re-released them in order to keep up with the non-menthol cigarette smokers in America. The packs are identical in design to standard menthol Newports except the turquoise-colored area is red on the Full Flavors and mustard-yellow on the Lights. Newport Slim 120s (introduced 1998), Newport \"Stripes\" and Newport \"M-Blend\" were other varieties that have also been discontinued.\n\nIn some Latin American markets, such as tourist areas of the Dominican Republic, British American Tobacco has released some limited edition varieties and outer packagings including:\n\n\nIn July 2017, R.J. Reynolds announced they would introduce new flavors called Newport Platinum. It would be released in two variants: Newport Platinum (King Size and 100s) and Newport Platinum Blue (also King Size and 100s).\n\n"}

The design of the superstructure was later incorporated into the design of the Arleigh Burke class destroyer.

It briefly operated as a sensor for the SPACETRACK program but was transferred to the U.S. Navy and refurbished in 1976 to support Aegis Combat System development. It is still used by Lockheed Martin for Aegis research and development, and houses not only Navy and Lockheed Martin personnel, but personnel from numerous subcontractors, such as Mission Solutions Engineering and Northrop Grumman.

He gained fame as an actor in \"The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash\", a spoof on the actual history of The Beatles in which he also performed as a member of The Rutles. He is also known for his stint as a member of The Beach Boys between 1971 and 1974. Fataar may also be recognized for his contributions as a record producer, and has worked on projects scoring music to film and television.\n\nFataar's first childhood band was The Flames, a band from his birthplace of Durban, South Africa that began in 1963. He joined the band at the age of nine. The band made several recordings as well as touring all over Southern Africa and before long they became quite popular in South Africa. By the time he was twelve years old he had already won the honour of being voted as the \"Best Rock Drummer in South Africa.\" \n\nIn 1968 the band moved to London and began touring in the United Kingdom. On one of their tours, they were spotted by a founding member of The Beach Boys, Carl Wilson. He was impressed by their talent and offered to sign them to the Beach Boys new record label, Brother Records. The band moved to Los Angeles, United States, and they recorded and released their 1970 album \"The Flame \" with Carl Wilson producing the album.\n\nThe Flames disbanded in late 1970, and Fataar and his former Flame bandmate Blondie Chaplin were recruited by The Beach Boys, in March 1972. Fataar was asked to play drums for the band after drummer Dennis Wilson suffered a debilitating hand accident. The duo recorded two albums with the Beach Boys, and began touring with them in 1971. The 1972 Beach Boys album \"Carl and the Passions – \"So Tough\"\" featured musical and vocal contributions from Chaplin and Fataar. It also included two songs written by the duo, \"Here She Comes\" and \"Hold On Dear Brother\". On the band's next album, \"Holland\", released a year later, both musicians recorded, and provided backing vocals, including the hit single \"Sail On, Sailor\", on which Chaplin sang as lead vocalist. They additionally collaborated with Carl Wilson and Mike Love on the song \"Leaving This Town\". 1973 saw the first live album \"The Beach Boys in Concert\", upon which Fataar performed. It featured a live version of the previously unreleased Chaplin/Fataar/Love collaboration \"We Got Love\", which was originally intended to be released on the \"Holland\" album, but was removed from the running order to make way for single \"Sail On, Sailor\". Both Fataar and Chaplin would later depart the band, with Fataar only appearing on the tracks \"It's OK\" and \"That Same Song\" off the Beach Boys' next studio album, 1976's \"15 Big Ones\". Fataar is also credited as having played on the 1980 album \"Keepin' the Summer Alive.\"\n\nIn March 2019, Big Noise's Al Gomes and Connie Watrous presented a plaque from Roger Williams University to Fataar in Providence, RI at a sold-out Bonnie Raitt / James Taylor concert. The plaque commemorates The Beach Boys' September 22, 1971 concert at The Ramada Inn in Portsmouth, RI, now Roger Williams University's Baypoint Inn & Conference Center. The concert was a very significant historic event in The Beach Boys' career – it was the very first time Fataar played on-stage as a new member of The Beach Boys, which then led to Chaplin joining the band, and essentially changed The Beach Boys' live and recording act's line-up into a multi-cultural group.\n\nIn 1978, Fataar starred in \"All You Need Is Cash\", a mockumentary film known more commonly as \"The Rutles\", a spoof on the real life history of The Beatles, which had a follow up to a \"Saturday Night Live\" television sketch. The Beatlesque music for the Rutles was written by Neil Innes, formerly of the \"Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band\" and musical collaborator with \"Monty Python\". Fataar's character was Stig O'Hara, the band's guitarist (analogous to George Harrison). He speaks no dialogue in the film, and indeed is sent up as \"the quiet one\" in it. Fataar's then wife, Penelope Tree, also appeared in \"All You Need Is Cash\", as Stig's wife, Penelope.\n\nFataar was less than quiet on the two albums produced by The Rutles, \"The Rutles\" and \"Archeology\", which featured him playing guitar, bass, sitar, drums, and singing. He would also go on to record a single with Eric Idle as 'Dirk & Stig' titled, \"Mr. Sheene\" / \"Ging Gang Goolie\".\n\nWith Bonnie Raitt\n\nWith Tim Finn\n\nWith Peter Cetera\n\nWith Etta James\n\nWith Ryan Adams\n\nWith Jennifer Warnes\n\nWith Boz Scaggs\n\nWith Phoebe Snow\n\nWith Robert Palmer\n\nWith Elton John\n\nWith Steve Harley\n\nFataar has also combined his talents as an actor and a musician, developing musical scores for both film and television. An example includes the composition of the score for an Australian film \"Spotswood\".\n\nWorking in his capacity as producer, Fataar has produced the music for various films that include \"High Tide\", \"Les Patterson Saves the World\", and \"The Coca-Cola Kid\", in which he makes a cameo appearance as an actor as well.\n\nFataar has worked as a session musician, notably for Ian McLagan as well as other artists, as a drummer. \nFataar emigrated to Australia in 1978 where he recorded with and co-produced albums for Tim Finn, played the drums on the Split Enz song \"Message To My Girl\", and also worked with Crowded House, Jenny Morris, Peter Blakeley, and Wendy Matthews as well as various other artists.\n\nIn 1979 Fataar was introduced to Bonnie Raitt, and recorded on her \"Green Light\" album. In 1990, he joined up with Raitt, and has been a member of Raitt's band. Fataar continued to work in between other projects as a sideman for many artists, also on Peter Cetera's first album, usually as a drummer.\n\nRicky Fataar was married to the fashion model Penelope Tree with whom he had one child, Paloma Fataar. Later he married dancer Valerie Velardi, with whom he had a second daughter, Francesca Fataar.\n"}

It is one of two Anglican churches in the town, the other being Holy Trinity. All Saints has existed since Norman times and it is set in the oldest part of the town, near to where the River Aire is crossed by Ireland Bridge.\n\nThe history of the church probably dates back to pre-Norman times. It is thought that there might have been a wooden church on this location for many years prior to the Norman conquest, although no records exist. The first records of the church indicate it was rebuilt some time after 1066 by the Lord of the Manor, William Paganel, who gave it, with other possessions of his, to Drax Priory in the time of Archbishop Thurstan (1119–1140).\n\nThis building was probably rebuilt many times over the centuries, culminating in the present structure, which was begun during the reign of Henry VIII (1491–1547). The choir was erected in 1518, when the church was dedicated to All Saints, having previously been dedicated to Saint Lawrence. The current tower was constructed in the 15th century and heightened with a new belfry added in 1739. The two-light bell openings that adorn each side of the tower were 19th century additions.\n\nThe church received a new clock in 1856 and was renovated in 1870–1871 when the Ferrand Chapel became the vestry and some of the pews that were tied to the local Manor Houses were stripped out.\n\nThe church has a stained-glass window crafted by William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones. There is a peal of bells, for many years six in number, with a further two added in 1873. In 1904, a new road was built to the east of the church and cut the churchyard in two. Several gravestones were used to make paths from the exhumed graves. One gravestone that was lost was that of John Nicholson, a poet who had been buried in the churchyard in April 1843.\n\nThe church was Grade II* listed in 1966.

The pay-per-view was also created as a testing nWo event in order to see if there was enough demand to having two PPVs per month (one as a WCW event and the other as an nWo event). Despite the initial poor review, WCW elected to keep the event on its calendar (as prior to 1997 it did not have a regular January PPV event) and Souled Out became a co-branded WCW/nWo event during the 1998 edition. This established a practice WCW used throughout 1998, as all of its pay-per-view events that year were co-branded. The co-branding continued until the following Souled Out, when interim WCW President Ric Flair declared that WCW pay-per-views would no longer carry nWo branding.\n\nThe final Souled Out event was held in 2000, and WCW renamed its January PPV WCW Sin for 2001.

Klein Curaçao has a desert climate (in the Köppen climate classification \"BWh\" and \"BWk\"), a climate in which there is an excess of evaporation over precipitation. The only structures on the island are an old lighthouse, a beach house, and several huts. Klein Curaçao is well known as a beautiful diving spot because of its coral and underwater caves. The island was designated as a protected Ramsar site in 2018.\n\nGoats were once allowed to roam the island, which contributed to desertification. In 1871, John Godden, an English mining engineer, visited the island, and until 1886 phosphate was mined and exported to Europe. The island was mined out, the level of the island dropped, and seabird populations plummeted. Reforestation is being undertaken by CARMABI Marine Research Station, Curaçao. The island also played a part in the slave trade. The Dutch West India Company brought many slaves from Africa to Curaçao. Before these slaves came ashore in Curaçao, the sick were placed in quarantine at Klein Curaçao. The remains of this first quarantine building can still be found in the northwest of the island. The slaves, and other passengers who did not survive the voyage, were buried at Klein Curaçao. There are several graves in the southern part of the island.\n\nThe Dutch West India Company were also given licenses to hunt monk seal (highly endangered now) on Klein Curaçao. Like its mother island of Curaçao, the island is little affected by hurricanes, but several storms have left their mark. The first was the hurricane of 1877, which destroyed the first lighthouse on the island. The next lighthouse, which still survives, was built in the interior of the island.\n\nKlein Curaçao has no permanent inhabitants, only a few palm-frond covered sheds for day trippers from Curaçao, and apart from some coconut palms has little vegetation. There are some fishermen's huts where fishermen normally stay for some days. They get water from the Coast Guard of Curaçao. The windward side is a graveyard for boats that did not stay out far enough or lost power. A small tanker, the \"Maria Bianca Guidesman\", is gradually being demolished by the constant pounding of the waves since 1988. The remains of another four or five boats have been washed far onshore.\n\n"}

It is a conversion of the Intellivision cartridge \"Frog Bog\" released earlier that year. In both games, each player controls a frog sitting on a lily pad, attempting to eat more flies than the other. \"Frogs and Flies\" is similar to the 1978 Sega-Gremlin arcade game \"Frogs\".\n\nEach game starts out in the morning with a light blue sky. If there is not a second player, the system will automatically take control of the red frog within a few seconds. Each frog jumps from one lily pad to the other. During each hop, a number of flies fly around the screen. The player pushes the fire button, which causes the frog's tongue to stick out. If the frog is in the right spot ahead or behind a fly, it catches and eats the fly. Each time a fly is captured it is worth two points. The game progresses throughout the day, with the sky turning a darker shade of blue, and eventually turning black as the day ends. About a minute after the sky turns black, the two frogs leave the screen – the green frog exits to the left, and the red frog to the right. A firefly then comes on to the screen carrying a \"The End\" message, which it leaves in the center of the screen. The frog who has captured the most flies at that point is the winner.\n\nThere are two different levels to \"Frogs and Flies\" that players can select. On the first level, the jumping off and landing points are fixed, the user needs to time their jumps to catch any flies who may come into the frog's flight path. On the second level, the frogs are free to move about the ground to catch flies as the jumping and landing points are not fixed. A player can even cause a frog to jump into the water – in that case, the frog will swim back on to the nearest pad. Generally this is to be avoided since it takes several seconds for the frog to swim back to the pad.\n\nMattel released the game for its Intellivision with the name \"Frog Bog\", and an Atari 2600 version under its M Network label with the name \"Frogs and Flies\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1910792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910792", "title": "Gillick competence", "text": "Gillick competence\n\nGillick competence is a term originating in England and is used in medical law to decide whether a child (under 16 years of age) is able to consent to their own medical treatment, without the need for parental permission or knowledge.\n\nThe standard is based on the 1985 decision of the House of Lords in \"Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority\". The case is binding in England and Wales, and has been adopted to varying extents in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Similar provision is made in Scotland by the Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991. In Northern Ireland, although separate legislation applies, the then Department of Health and Social Services stated that there was no reason to suppose that the House of Lords' decision would not be followed by the Northern Ireland Courts.\n\nThe Gillick case involved a health departmental circular advising doctors on the contraception of minors (for this purpose, under sixteens). The circular stated that the prescription of contraception was a matter for the doctor's discretion and that they could be prescribed to under sixteens without parental consent. This matter was litigated because an activist, Victoria Gillick, ran an active campaign against the policy. Gillick sought a declaration that prescribing contraception was illegal because the doctor would commit an offence of encouraging sex with a minor and that it would be treatment without consent as consent vested in the parent.\n\nThe issue before the House of Lords was only whether the minor involved could give consent. \"Consent\" here was considered in the broad sense of consent to battery or assault: in the absence of patient consent to treatment, a doctor, even if well-intentioned, might be sued/charged.\n\nThe House of Lords focused on the issue of consent rather than a notion of 'parental rights' or parental power. In fact, the court held that 'parental rights' did not exist, other than to safeguard the best interests of a minor. The majority held that in some circumstances a minor could consent to treatment, and that in these circumstances a parent had no power to veto treatment.\n\nLord Scarman and Lord Fraser proposed slightly different tests (Lord Bridge agreed with both). Lord Scarman's test is generally considered to be the test of 'Gillick competency'. He required that a child could consent if he or she fully understood the medical treatment that is proposed:\n\nThe ruling holds particularly significant implications for the legal rights of minor children in England in that it is broader in scope than merely medical consent. It lays down that the authority of parents to make decisions for their minor children is not absolute, but diminishes with the child's evolving maturity. The result of Gillick is that in England today, except in situations that are regulated otherwise by law, the legal right to make a decision on any particular matter concerning the child shifts from the parent to the child when the child reaches sufficient maturity to be capable of making up his or her own mind on the matter requiring decision.\n\nThe decisions \"In re R\" (1991) and \"Re W\" (1992) (especially Lord Donaldson) contradict the Gillick decision somewhat. From these, and subsequent cases, it is suggested that although the parental right to veto treatment ends, parental powers do not \"terminate\" as suggested by Lord Scarman in Gillick. However, these are only obiter statements and were made by a lower court; therefore, they are not legally binding. However, the parens patriae jurisdiction of the court remains available allowing a court order to force treatment against a child's (and parent's) wishes.\n\nA child who is deemed \"Gillick competent\" is able to prevent their parents viewing their medical records. As such, medical staff will not make a disclosure of medical records of a child who is deemed \"Gillick competent\" unless consent is manifest.\n\nIn a 2006 judicial review, \"R (on the application of Axon) v Secretary of State for Health\", the High Court affirmed Gillick in allowing for medical confidentiality for teenagers seeking an abortion. The court rejected a claim that not granting parent's a \"right to know\" whether their child had sought an abortion, birth control or contraception breached Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The \"Axon\" case set out a list of criteria that a doctor must meet when deciding whether to provide treatment to an under-16 child without informing their parents: they must be convinced that they can understand all aspects of the advice, that the patient's physical or mental health is likely to suffer without medical advice, that it is in the best interests of the patient to provide medical advice, that (in provision of contraception) they are likely to have sex whether contraception is provided or not, and that they have made an effort to convince the young person to disclose the information to their parents.\n\nIn most jurisdictions the parent of an emancipated minor does not have the ability to consent to therapy, regardless of the Gillick test. Typical positions of emancipation arise when the minor is married (\"R v D\" [1984] AC 778, 791) or in the military.\n\nThe nature of the standard remains uncertain. The courts have so far declined invitations to define rigidly \"Gillick competence\" and the individual doctor is free to make a decision, consulting peers if this may be helpful, as to whether that child is \"Gillick competent\".\n\nSome recent legislation appears to explicitly restrict the ability of Gillick competent children to consent to medical treatment outside of clinical settings. For example, parental consent is required for the treatment of children with asthma using standby salbutamol inhalers in schools. These restrictions have yet to be tested in court.\n\nThe Australian High Court gave specific and strong approval for the Gillick decision in \"Marion's Case\", \"Secretary of the Department of Health and Community Services v JWB and SMB\" (1992) 175 CLR 189. The Gillick competence doctrine is part of Australian case law (see, e.g., \"DoCS v Y\" [1999] NSWSC 644).\n\nThere is no express authority in Australia on \"In re R\" and \"Re W\", so whether a parent's right terminates is unclear. This lack of authority reflects that the reported cases have all involved minors who have been found to be incompetent, and that Australian courts will make decisions in the \"parens patriae\" jurisdiction regardless of Gillick competence.\n\nIn South Australia and New South Wales legislation clarifies the common law, establishing a Gillick-esque standard of competence but preserving concurrent consent between parent and child for the ages 14–16.\n\nOn 21 May 2009, confusion arose between Gillick competence, which identifies under-16s with the capacity to consent to their own treatment, and the Fraser guidelines, which are concerned only with contraception and focus on the desirability of parental involvement and the risks of unprotected sex in that area.\n\nA persistent rumour arose that Victoria Gillick disliked having her name associated with the assessment of children's capacity, but an editorial in the BMJ from 2006 claimed that Gillick said that she \"has never suggested to anyone, publicly or privately, that [she] disliked being associated with the term 'Gillick competent.\n\nIt is lawful for doctors to provide contraceptive advice and treatment without parental consent providing certain criteria are met. These criteria, known as the Fraser guidelines, were laid down by Lord Fraser in the House of Lords' case and require the professional to be satisfied that:\n\nAlthough these criteria specifically refer to contraception, the principles are deemed to apply to other treatments, including abortion. Although the judgement in the House of Lords referred specifically to doctors, it is considered to apply to other health professionals, including nurses. It may also be interpreted as covering youth workers and health promotion workers who may be giving contraceptive advice and condoms to young people under 16, but this has not been tested in court.\n\nIf a person under the age of 18 refuses to consent to treatment, it is possible in some cases for their parents or the courts to overrule their decision. However, this right can be exercised only on the basis that the welfare of the young person is paramount. In this context, welfare does not simply mean their physical health. The psychological effect of having the decision overruled would have to be taken into account and would normally be an option only when the young person was thought likely to suffer \"grave and irreversible mental or physical harm\". Usually, when a parent wants to overrule a young person's decision to refuse treatment, health professionals will apply to the courts for a final decision.\n\nAn interesting aside to the Fraser guidelines is that many regard Lord Scarman's judgement as the leading judgement in the case, but because Lord Fraser's judgement was shorter and set out in more specific terms – and in that sense more accessible to health and welfare professionals – it is his judgement that has been reproduced as containing the core principles.\n\n"}

{"id": "1910797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910797", "title": "Winged Victory (novel)", "text": "Winged Victory (novel)\n\nWinged Victory is a 1934 novel by English World War I fighter pilot Victor Maslin Yeates that is widely regarded as a classic description of aerial combat and the futility of war. \n\nThe novel concerns World War I, the existence pilots lead and the fear involved in flying early biplanes. Its protagonist, Tom Cundall, plans to leave the Royal Air Force when his service is up and live on a West Country farm with his friends. However, by the time he is due to leave the Air Force, all his friends have \"gone west\". This leaves him a broken man. The narrative combination of action, pathos, humour and humility set against the huge casualties of the RAF in 1918 makes \"Winged Victory\" one of the classics of Great War literature.\n\nThe book is semi-autobiographical, V. M. Yeates having served with 46 Squadron flying Sopwith Camels in 1918 and also having lost all his friends in the war. T. E. Lawrence praised it on its release with the words \"Admirable, admirable, admirable. One of the most distinguished histories of the war ... masterly\". However, it went out of print due to a lack of a publisher and was soon forgotten. Yeates died in 1934 from tuberculosis.\n\nIt had a resurgence in popularity with RAF pilots during World War II because of its accurate descriptions of air warfare. The book was reissued with a new preface and a tribute by Henry Williamson in 1961 (it was Williamson who encouraged Yeates to complete the book after World War I). It was reprinted in 1972 in paperback by Richard Clay (The Chaucer Press) Ltd., and republished in paperback in 2004. Yeates wrote in the flyleaf of Williamson's copy of \"Winged Victory\" that: \"I started [writing the book] in April 1933 in Colindale Hospital. I could not write there, so walked out one morning, the doctor threatening death. I wrote daily till the end of the year. My chief difficulty was to compromise between truth and art, for I was writing a novel that was to be an exact reproduction of the period and an exact analysis and synthesis of a state of mind.\"\n\"Winged Victory\" is remarkable for its depictions of World War I aerial combat.\n\"They flew over the ghastly remains of Villers-Bretonneux which were still being tortured by bursting shells upspurting in columns of smoke and debris that stood solid for a second and then floated fading away in the wind. All along the line from Hamel to Hangard Wood the whiter puff-balls of shrapnel were appearing and fading multitudinously and incessantly ... A flaming meteor fell out of a cloud close by them and plunged earthwards. It was an aeroplane going down in flames from some fight above the clouds. Where it fell the atmosphere was stained by a thanatognomonic black streak ... Tom sitting there in the noise and the hard wind had the citied massy earth his servant tumbler, waiting upon his touch of stick or rudder for its guidance; instantly responding, ready to leap and frisk a lamb-planet amid the steady sun-bound sheep ... Some of the cloud peaks thrust up to ten thousand feet; in the blue fields beyond there was an occasional flash of a tilting wing reflecting the sun. Mac climbed as fast as he could. In a few minutes they were at ten thousand, and the Huns, a mile above them, were discernable as aeroplanes, bluely translucent ... Rattle of guns and flash of tracers and the Fokker in a vertical turn, red, with extension on the top planes. Tom hated those extensions. He was doing a very splitarse turn for a Hun, but tracers seemed to be finding him. Got him, oh got him: over, flopping over, nose dropping, spinning.\"\n\nIn \"Winged Victory\" some characters offer a prescient and pessimistic view of the causes of war, far removed from the jingoism of many of Yeates' contemporary writers: \"For there's one thing financiers cannot or will not see. They have visions of a frontierless world in which their operations will proceed without hindrance and make all human activities dependent on them; but their world is impossible because finance is sterile, and a state living by finance must always have neighbours from which to suck blood, or it is like a dog eating its own tail...an intense war-fever inoculation was carried out by the press. It took rather less than three months, I believe, to make the popular demand for war irresistible...There'll be a famous orgy of money snatching over our bones.\" Other characters express contrary sentiments - the above argument is rendered a \"bitter snarl\" by another. Above all, Yeates reproduces the typical arguments of a 1918 RFC mess, and we see the characters portraying a wide and complex range of views about the war.\n\nOne of the most notable things about \"Winged Victory\" is how it challenges the common perception of the war in the air during the First World War, especially when compared with other contemporary fiction. Unlike most other \"air\" novels of the time (e.g. Biggles ), it fits neatly into the canon of so-called \"Disenchantment\" novels, which while well regarded in the present day, were largely ignored.\n\nWhile it acknowledges that there are high scoring aces, who seem invulnerable (notably the character of \"Mac\"), most of the characters find the war interminably unpleasant, alternatively horrid and dull, enlivened only by regular nihilistic drinking binges. Equally, it acknowledges the serious flaws in allied aircraft by 1918. While many more modern sources (including Wikipedia) list the Sopwith Camel as an excellent, almost unsurpassed aircraft, Yeates, via Cundall, complains that it was too slow, and could not climb high enough - flaws so serious that Cundall's squadron is regularly assigned to ground attack, being covered by SE5as.\n\nThe desired aircraft is neither the Camel, not its replacements the Sopwith Snipe or Sopwith Salamander (wrongly assumed by Cundall to be a new fighter variant instead of a ground attack aircraft), but instead the all-but forgotten high flying Sopwith Dolphin. This tellingly reveals that excellent pilots such as Yeates and his contemporaries in 46 squadron valued height, and the concurrent ability to strike unseen, running counter to the common image of swirling dogfights.\n\nThe title, \"Winged Victory\", was not Yeates' choice - it was forced on him by his original publisher, who wanted the book to appear more patriotic and exciting. Yeates' original choice of title was the much more apt, bleaker \"Wingless Victor\". \n\nYeates was credited with five enemy aircraft shot down in World War I (2 + 3 shared). Some of the characters of the book have real names of pilots who served in 46 Squadron at the time, like ace George Edwin Thomson (21 enemy aircraft shot down, called \"Tommy\" in the book, and who is transferred to Home Establishment before April 1918), Harry Noel Cornforth Robinson (called \"Robinson\" in the book, 10 aircraft destroyed), and Horace Gilbert Wanklyn Debenham (\"Debenham\" in the book, six enemy aircraft destroyed). There are some with names very similar to real names, like Flight Commander \"MacAndrews (Mac)\" who is based upon Canadian ace Donald MacLaren (48 enemy aircraft and six balloons shot down), who served in 46 Squadron at the time.\n\nCuriously, the Sphere Books 1969 edition of the book and the subsequent Mayflower Books 1972 edition have an illustration of SE5as dogfighting with Fokker D.VIIs on the cover when the only aircraft the main characters fly is the Sopwith Camel. (The 1974 Mayflower reprint shows Sopwith Camels). The 1962 reprint of the Jonathan Cape edition, however, has a fly leaf with two Sopwith Camels depicted.\n\nIt was a large inspiration in the work of Derek Robinson, particularly the 1971 Booker Prize-nominated \"Goshawk Squadron\".\n"}

Despite a few encounters with enemy airplanes the Polish fighters (which could barely match the speed of German bombers) were not able to shoot down any enemy planes. On 8 September the school was evacuated from Ulez and Dęblin.\n\nHe was ordered with the cadets to Romania, where they were told to await re-equipment: British and French aircraft were rumoured to have been sent, but no aircraft arrived. Urbanowicz returned to Poland to continue to fight, but after the Soviet invasion of Poland, he was captured by a Soviet irregular unit. The same day he managed to escape with two cadets and crossed the Romanian border and eventually found his way to France where, after the fall of Poland, a new Polish army was being formed.\n\nWhile in France he and a group of other Polish pilots were invited to join the Royal Air Force in Great Britain. After initial training with 1 School of Army Co-operation at Old Sarum, he was sent to 6 OTU for re-training on fighters in July 1940. In August he was assigned to No. 145 Squadron RAF, and became operational on 4 August 1940. On 8 August he shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 110 Major Joachim Schlichting of V./LG 1 while flying with No. 601 Squadron (although he was never officially attached to the unit) and on 12 August a Junkers Ju 88 of KG 51.\n\nOn 21 August he was transferred to the Polish-manned No. 303 Squadron, flying a Hawker Hurricane as \"A\" Flight commander. On 6 September he shot down a Bf 109 of JG 52. On 7 September he became Squadron Leader, after Zdzisław Krasnodębski was badly burned. On 15 September Urbanowicz claimed two Dornier Do. 17's of KG 2.\n\nOn 18 September 1940 Urbanowicz was awarded the Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari by the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Forces, General Sikorski. On 24 October, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nOn 27 September he was officially credited with shooting down four aircraft: two Ju 88s of KG 77, a Bf 109 and a Bf 110 of 15.LG 1. On 30 September he claimed three Bf 109s (one from stab.JG 26, one of II./JG 53 and one of 4.JG 54) and one Dornier Do 17 of KG 3. Despite his success Urbanowicz was never popular at Polish headquarters and on 21 October he was forced to hand over command of the Squadron to Zdzisław Henneberg.\n\nDuring the Battle of Britain, he claimed 15 confirmed kills and 1 probable, which made him one of the top Polish aces (second only to Stanisław Skalski) and in the top ten Allied aces of the battle.\n\nBetween 15 April 1941 and 1 June 1941 he commanded the 1st Polish Fighter Wing based at RAF Northolt, before being posted to staff work at No. 11 Group RAF HQ. In June 1941 he was assigned as the 2nd Air Attaché in the Polish Embassy in the United States.\n\nIn September 1943 Urbanowicz joined the USAAF 14th Air Force on attachment in China. On 23 October he joined the 75th Fighter Squadron of the 23rd Fighter Group (Flying Tigers). Flying a P-40 Warhawk he took part in several combat missions. On 11 December he fought against six Japanese Mitsubishi Zeros and claimed two shot down (these were actually Nakajima Ki-44 \"Tojo\" fighters of the 85th Sentai ).\n\nAccording to his reports he also shot other airplanes over China, and destroyed some on the ground but those victories were not officially confirmed. According to Kenneth K. Koskodian, he downed 11 Japanese aircraft while being Claire Lee Chennault's guest. He was later awarded the US Air Medal and a Chinese Flying Cross.\n\nIn December 1943 he returned to the United Kingdom and later became an Air Attaché in the USA again.\n\nDuring the war none of Witold Urbanowicz's planes were hit by a single enemy bullet.\n\nIn 1946, he returned to Poland, but was arrested four times by the communist Służba Bezpieczeństwa secret police as a suspected spy. After his release, he fled to the USA. He lived in New York City working for American Airlines, Eastern Airlines and Republic Aviation, retiring in 1973. In 1991 he visited Poland after the fall of communism and again in 1995 when he was promoted to the rank of General. He died in New York on 17 August 1996.\n\nA fibreglass Hawker Hurricane gate guardian was unveiled at RAF Uxbridge in September 2010 in the colours of Urbanowicz's aircraft from the Battle of Britain.\n\nWitold Urbanowicz was portrayed by Marcin Dorociński in the 2018 film \"Hurricane: 303 Squadron\".\n\n\n"}

The sea tractor was most popular during the early 1930s, as a unique way to give scenic tours to patrons of waterfront hotels and resorts. In other applications, sea tractors were used merely as a ferry through shallow waters. Sea tractors are less used in present time – as boats, ferries, and other aquatic vessels often serve their function much more efficiently and comfortably..\n\nThe hotel at Burgh Island operates a sea tractor, to carry hotel guests and other visitors the to the island at high tide, when the causeway connecting the island to the mainland is submerged. The current tractor is the third one to be used at this location.\n\nA sea tractor is also used at South Sands Beach near Salcombe, Devon. The beach has no jetty or pier and the South Sands Ferry therefore cannot reach dry land to pick up passengers. The sea tractor transports passengers to the ferry waiting a few metres out to sea.\n\nThe United States Army Corps of Engineers operates a three-wheeled sea tractor called the Coastal Research Amphibious Buggy (CRAB). This vehicle consists of a wheeled tripod supporting an operating platform above ground level. It can move at on land and at a somewhat slower speed in water. It was built for scientific research on Beach nourishment.\n\nThe British and Irish maritime rescue organisation the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) operates a number of different amphibious tractors for launching and recovering inshore lifeboats from beaches. These are wheeled or tracked vehicles capable of operating largely submerged, and some have cable winches.

The party was founded on May 13, 1990, when was known as the Social Democratic Party of Moldova (). The Founding Conference elected Oazu Nantoi, Ion Negură, Alexandru Coșelev as the Party Co-Chairpersons. Initially, the Social-Democratic Party of Moldova fought for the independence of the Moldovan SSR. That was the first party to promote the values of European social democracy in Moldova.\n\nAt the third congress of the party, 25–26 February 1995, Anatol Țăranu was elected as a new head of the party. On the eve of 1996 presidential elections, Social Democrats were the only ones to openly support Petru Lucinschi. During 1996-1998, the party underwent some internal problems generated from within by controversial opinions on the party political course as well as from outside. This internal crisis culminated in 1998, when Gheorghe Sima group left the party. The old team headed by Oazu Nantoi took over the party leadership.\n\nOazu Nantoi was a member of the Government of Moldova, but he resigned from Government in March 2000 and the 7th Congress of the party, 27–28 May 2000, was just the first step towards launching its own candidate as the president of Moldova. Social-Democratic Party of Moldova was a member of the Socialist International. Incumbent Party Chairperson, Oazu Nantoi, attended in November 1999 the 21st Paris Congress of the Socialist International.\n\nAt the seventh congress of the party, 1 February 2004, Oazu Nantoi came with a proposition for Ion Mușuc (famous businessman in telecommunications) to take over the party leadership and refused he himself to be designated. In 1999 Social Democrats insisted on Ion Muşuc candidacy for the position of Mayor of Chișinău.\n\nAt the legislative elections on March 6th, 2005, the party won 2.9% of the popular vote, but no seats. In December 2007 the party merged with the Social Democracy Party (\"Partidul Democraţiei Sociale\", PDS) of former prime minister Dumitru Braghiș. Some representatives of the Centrist Union of Moldova joined the new party, too. They didn't agree with the decision of their leader, Mihai Petrache, to abandon the process of negotiation regarding the unification of social democrats that had started some months before. Braghis has become new leader of the merged party. Eduard Mușuc, who was the chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Moldova before the fusion congress, has become the new secretary general of the party.\n\nIn June 2008 Eduard Muşuc formed a coalition with the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova and Christian Democratic People's Party to become president of the City Council of Chişinău. The year before the party's president Braghis was heavily criticized by the same communists when he ran for mayor. Some party members saw this as betrayal and left the party for Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova (PLDM).\n\nIn February 2010, it was reported that approximately 11,000 members of the PSD defected to the rival centre-left Democratic Party of Moldova.\n\nFollowing the 12th party congress, on April 17, 2010, Victor Șelin has been elected as the new party president.\n\nThe party took part in the 1994 (3.66%), 1998 (1.86%), 2001 (2.47%), 2005 (2.92%), July 2009, 2010 parliamentary elections, but didn't pass the threshold of representation.\n\nThe party took part in the local election: 1995 (39 mandates in the rayonal and municipal councils (3.09%), 273 mandates in city and village councils (2.58%), 23 mayor mandates (2.89%), 1999 (16 mandates in the rayonal and municipal councils (5.13%), 249 mandates in city and village councils (4.08%), 18 mayor mandates (2.86%), 2003 (38 mandates in the rayonal and municipal councils (3.37%), 500 mandates in city and village councils (4.61%), 44 mayor mandates (4.90%), 2007 (36 mandates in the rayonal and municipal councils (3.21%), 294 mandates in city and village councils (2.77%), 15 mayor mandates (1.67%).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1910846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910846", "title": "Party switching", "text": "Party switching\n\nParty-switching is any change in political party affiliation of a partisan public figure, usually one currently holding elected office.\n\nIn many countries, party-switching takes the form of politicians refusing to support their political parties in coalition governments. This happens particularly commonly in countries without firmly-established political parties, such as Vanuatu and French Polynesia where in 2004, a few members of various parties left the governing coalition, forcing it to collapse. Party switches often occur with the formation of new parties — witness the situation in the United Kingdom, where some Liberals moved to the Labour Party in the early twentieth century. In formerly communist countries in Europe, de-Sovietisation saw many Communist-Party representatives switch to other parties ranging on the political spectrum from socialist to conservative.\n\nIn some cases, the defectors from an opposition party may choose to support a ruling coalition. In Poland, for example, the exit of the populist Samoobrona party from the government prompted a number of its members to leave and form a new parliamentary group.\n\nParty switching also occurs quite commonly in Brazil, Italy, Ukraine, India, Malaysia and the Philippines.\n\nAustralia has seen high-profile defections since 1995, including the 1997 move by Cheryl Kernot (then leader of the Australian Democrats) to the Labor Party, the declared independence of former Labor senator Mal Colston (1996) and the disintegration of the Democrats. It is rare for a member of one of the three major parties, the Greens, Labor or the Liberal/National parties to switch to one of the others. Far more likely is that they leave, to become an independent.\n\nItaly saw relevant examples of party switches during its republican history. Most affected by the phenomenon was the Italian Socialist Party which was in an ambiguous position, between Soviet-funded and revolutionary Communist Party, and the social-democratic area, not clearly choosing any of these two possible alliances. Italian Democratic Socialist Party switched from PSI in 1947 to become the leader of reformist left, while the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity switched on the other side in 1964 to search a stronger alliance with the PCI. If these switches were allowed by the pure proportional system of that time, situation did not change when the electoral system was turned into parallel voting in 1993, because coalitions leaders began to accept quite all new parties, ever if very little ones, in their alliances.\n\nParty switching in New Zealand gained currency during the end of the 1980s, and even more so in the late 1990s after mixed member proportional representation was implemented. In particular, the phrase \"waka-jumping\" entered the public consciousness in 1998 when then-Prime Minister Jenny Shipley expelled the New Zealand First party from the ruling coalition government, and several New Zealand First MPs resigned from the party and stayed loyal to the government. In response to these defections, the Electoral Integrity Act was passed in 2001, which later expired in 2005. A proposal to replace the Act in 2005 failed. The new Electoral (Integrity) Act Amendment Bill 2018 is currently before the Select Committee.\n\nIn Nicaragua some major party switches occurred between 2002 and 2006 when the two major political parties, the Constitutional Liberal Party and the Sandinista National Liberation Front, formed a pact and members of both parties left to form new parties or make alliances with smaller ones.\n\nIn Ukraine, the imperative mandate provision of the Ukrainian Constitution banned party switching in Parliament from 2004 to 2010. The mandate stipulated that the constitution and laws of Ukraine obliged members of the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's Parliament, to remain members of the parliamentary faction or bloc in which they were elected.\n\nThis was evident during the 2007 Ukrainian political crisis where members of the opposition crossed party lines with plans to undermine Presidential authority and move towards the 300 constitutional majority.\n\nParty switching is not unusual in Turkey, but Kubilay Uygun is known for his repeated switching during his single term in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (1995 – 1999). He resigned from his party seven times and served four different parties, finishing as an independent.\n\nIn the United States' political landscape, dominated by its two-party system, switches generally occur between the Republican and Democratic parties, while switching to Independent (No Party Preference, or Decline to State) is increasingly common and far outpacing growth of both the Republican and Democratic parties. Third parties are also an option. One notable switch took place in 2001 when Senator Jim Jeffords defected from the Republican Party to become a political independent, which placed the Senate in Democratic control. Use of the term party switch often connotes a transfer of held power from one party to another.\n\nIn the Russian Federation, party switching is considered illegal in the State Duma and is highly frowned upon. After major party switches during the Boris Yeltsin Presidency, party switching was declared illegal in the State Duma, and can result in a forced resignation of the State Duma representative by the chairman of their ex-political party. However, there is an exception. If a member of the State Duma is considered an Independent politician, he or she may be permitted to join and switch to a party at any time. They may not switch after that. After a forced resignation, the State Duma representative can run again in future elections, as their new party's whip. The chairman of the political party can choose to replace the party switcher with whomever they choose. Party merging, however, is not illegal and can be seen when a big amount of political parties merged into United Russia, the current ruling party of Russia.\n\n"}

Smith served as team captain of both the Edmonton Oilers and Philadelphia Flyers, the former of which he led for five years and guided to the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nSmith was also the head coach for the Western Hockey League's Kelowna Rockets from 2016 to 2018.\n\nSmith was drafted in the first round, 18th overall, of the 1992 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils. As a member of the Western Hockey League (WHL)'s Regina Pats, he was named to the WHL's All-Rookie Team for the 1991–92 season and the WHL First All-Star Team in 1992–93, also winning the Bill Hunter Trophy as the WHL's top defenceman in the latter season. Internationally, Smith was also a member of the gold medal-winning Canadian junior team at the World Junior Ice Hockey Championship in 1993 in Sweden, a roster also including future NHL stars Chris Pronger, Adrian Aucoin, Paul Kariya, Manny Legace and Martin Lapointe.\n\nSmith made his NHL debut with the Devils during the 1993–94 season, though he spent the majority of the season in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the team's affiliate, the Albany River Rats. He then missed the majority of the 1994–95 season due to a knee injury, but recovered in time to play in one Stanley Cup playoff game, his playoff debut, before eventually returning to captain the River Rats to a Calder Cup championship in 1995, the same year the Devils captured their first Stanley Cup. Then next season, 1995–96, Smith became a regular fixture on New Jersey's NHL roster.\n\nOn February 25, 1997, during the 1996–97 season, Smith was involved in a blockbuster trade, moving to the Toronto Maple Leafs, along with Steve Sullivan and the rights to Alyn McCauley, in exchange for Doug Gilmour, Dave Ellett and New Jersey's fourth-round draft pick in 1999 (which Toronto had acquired in the Dave Andreychuk trade the year before.)\n\nSmith spent parts of three seasons in Toronto before being traded to the Edmonton Oilers on March 3, 1999, during the 1998–99 season. When the Oilers' team captain Doug Weight was later traded to the St. Louis Blues, Smith's strong leadership tendencies resulted in his being handed the captaincy, where he would ultimately match Wayne Gretzky as the longest-serving captain in Oilers history at five seasons, wearing the \"C\" from 2001 to 2007, excluding the 2004–05 NHL lock-out in which the 2004–05 season was cancelled.\n\nSmith captained the Oilers to a largely unexpected run to the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals, in which they faced the Carolina Hurricanes, another dark horse team. However, the Oilers lost in the Final game of a gruelling seven-game series. He contributed one goal and four assists during Edmonton's surprise playoff run.\n\nOn July 1, 2007, Edmonton General Manager Kevin Lowe traded Smith, along with forward Joffrey Lupul, to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Joni Pitkänen, Geoff Sanderson and Philadelphia's third-round draft pick in 2009.\n\nIn his first and only season in Philadelphia, Smith captained a rebuilt Flyers squad to an Eastern Conference showdown against their inter-state rivals, the Pittsburgh Penguins. Despite the fact that the Penguins won the series, the Flyers' turnaround from the worst team in the NHL to their status in 2007–08 was a testament to Smith's leadership abilities.\n\nIn the 2008–09 season, Smith played his last year in the NHL with the Ottawa Senators before retiring from professional hockey on September 2, 2009. He later became an assistant coach for the Senators.\n\n\n"}

He served as Commander of the Narcotics Section from 1989 to 1992 before spending two years as a Deputy Chief of the police force's Patrol Division. In 1994, he was appointed Deputy Superintendent.\n\nIn 1998, he became the MPDC chief. During his tenure, he was involved in several high-profile cases as chief of police in Washington, D.C., such as the Chandra Levy murder investigation. He has also been in the spotlight since the September 11 attacks focused attention on security issues around Washington, D.C.\n\nRamsey is a graduate of the FBI National Academy and holds undergraduate and graduate degrees from Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois.\n\nHe has served as an adjunct professor at Lewis University and Northwestern University.\n\nRamsey is a former member of the National Infrastructure Advisory Council.\n\nRamsey's eight-year tenure as Chief of Police saw crime rates decline about 40%, the expansion of community policing and traffic safety programs, and improved MPDC recruiting and hiring standards, training, equipment, facilities and fleet. He reorganized the department to cut bureaucracy, and created Regional Operations Commands to oversee the quality of D.C. police services. He helped to create a non-emergency 3-1-1 system and made crime information readily available to the public through CrimeReports.com.\n\nHe and his department assisted the Department of Homeland Security during the state funerals of Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford.\n\nUnder Ramsey, the D.C, police instituted traffic checkpoints at which information about motorists who were breaking no law at the time was entered into a database. The move was called an \"invasion of privacy\" by an official of the police union.\n\nOn September 27, 2002, the MPD made a mass arrest of a large group of demonstrators who had assembled in DC's Pershing Park to protest the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings. The police enclosed over 400 people in the park and arrested them without ordering them to disperse or allowing them to leave the park. Many of the arrested were not actually demonstrators, but were journalists, legal observers, and pedestrians.\n\nOn January 13, 2006, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that the arrests violated the Fourth Amendment and that Chief Ramsey could be held personally liable for the violations. On August 2, 2007, City officials in Washington agreed to pay $1 million to more than 120 of the protesters, on top of other settlements by the D.C. government, including one for $640,000. Ramsey was represented by Mark Tuohey who generated at least $1.53 million in fees for his law firm Vinson & Elkins.\n\nAccording to testimony given by Detective Paul Hustler, Ramsey himself gave the arrest order, although he has repeatedly denied this. Hustler claims he overheard Ramsey say \"We're going to lock them up and teach them a lesson.\" \n\nOn November 20, 2006, Ramsey announced that he would step down as police chief on January 2, 2007, the inauguration day of Washington, D.C Mayor-Elect Adrian M. Fenty. Fenty selected Cathy Lanier, a 39-year-old commander of the MPDC's Homeland Security Division, as his replacement.\n\nEven though Ramsey's official last day was December 28, 2006, he stayed on until January 2, to deal with security during the state funeral of former president Gerald Ford.\n\nOn November 15, 2007, Philadelphia Mayor Elect Michael Nutter nominated Ramsey as Police Commissioner. Ramsey came out of retirement to accept the position, and he was sworn in at the beginning of Nutter's term as Mayor on January 7, 2008.\n\nSince Commissioner Ramsey assumed his position, the city's homicide rate has dropped 37 percent and violent crime 31 percent. In the city's nine most dangerous districts, which account for 65% of homicides and 75% of shootings, homicides are down by over 40 percent. Ramsey's tactics have included installing a network of surveillance cameras in the city's most dangerous sections, increasing the number of cops on the beat, and moving police patrols out of their squad cars and onto foot patrols or bicycle patrols. In 2014 President Obama selected Commissioner Ramsey to serve as Co-Chair of the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. Commissioner Ramsey has also served as President of the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) and the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA).\n\nOn October 14, 2015, Ramsey announced his retirement from the Philadelphia Police Department, effective on January 5, 2016.\n\n"}
{"id": "1910891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910891", "title": "Johann von Staupitz", "text": "Johann von Staupitz\n\nJohann von Staupitz, O.S.A. (c. 1460 – 28 December 1524) was a Catholic theologian, university preacher, and Vicar General of the Augustinian friars in Germany, who supervised Martin Luther during a critical period in his spiritual life. Martin Luther himself remarked, \"If it had not been for Dr. Staupitz, I should have sunk in hell.\" Although he remained Catholic, died as a Benedictine monk and had repudiated the Reformation, he is commemorated on 8 November as a priest in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod.\n\nStaupitz was born in Motterwitz around 1460. Descended from an old Saxon family of Czech origin (ze Stupic), he matriculated in the year 1485 and was accepted into the Augustinian order of friars in Munich before being posted to Tübingen, where he was eventually promoted to the rank of prior. In 1500, Staupitz was made a Doctor of Theology and in 1503 he was elected to the post of Vicar general of the German Congregation of Augustinians. He was also made dean of the theology faculty at the new University of Wittenberg when it was founded in 1502. In 1512, while in his fifties, Staupitz resigned his professorship and relocated to the southern part of Germany, resigning his vicar-generalship officially in 1520. In 1522 he accepted an offer from the Benedictines inviting him to join their order, becoming Abbot of St Peter's in Salzburg.\n\nAs Augustinian Superior, Staupitz first met Martin Luther at Erfurt in April 1506. A young friar plagued by persistent thoughts of spiritual inadequacy, Luther felt compelled to confess to Staupitz everything sinful he had ever done. At least once, Luther spent six hours confessing to Staupitz, who responded to the young man's doubts by counselling him on the Means of Grace and on salvation through the blood of Christ. He also commanded Luther to pursue a more academic career, hoping it would provide a distraction from his recurrent theological brooding.\n\nIn 1518 after Luther was declared a heretic, Staupitz was appointed promagister of the Augustinian order to plead in protest with Luther, discussing the issue of indulgences in great detail. Staupitz is sometimes categorized as a forerunner of Luther, although his actual words indicate a man driven by anxious suspicions and an encouraging desire to understand Luther's objections. Staupitz perceived Luther's complaints as questions against clerical abuses, rather than as fundamental disputes of dogma. Ultimately, Staupitz released Martin Luther from the Augustinian order, preserving the good name of the order while simultaneously giving Luther freedom to act. His connection with Luther's views was now sealed, and in 1520 Pope Leo X demanded an abjuration and revocation of heresy from Staupitz. He refused to revoke, on the grounds that he had never asserted Luther's heresies himself, but he did abjure and recognize the Pontiff as his judge. Staupitz was no Lutheran, but was thoroughly Catholic in matters of faith, especially as regards the freedom of the will, the meritoriousness of good works, and justification, which has been established by Paulus from the writings of Staupitz. However, Luther perceived his abjuration as a betrayal. In his last letter to Luther in 1524 Staupitz made it clear he was bitter about the direction of the Reformation and its seemingly willful destruction of the unity of the Christian Church.\n\nStaupitz also wrote theological works on the topics of predestination, faith, and love. In 1559, Pope Paul IV added these texts to the Index of Prohibited Books, seeing them as perhaps compromised by the friendly relations between Staupitz and Luther during Luther's earlier years.\n\nStaupitz died in 1524 at St Peter's Archabbey, Salzburg, where he had become a monk in 1522, rising quickly to the post of abbot. He is now celebrated in the Lutheran liturgical calendar.\n\n"}

She was a noted gardener and a writer and editor of the works of others.\n\nBorn as Edith Helen Chaplin in Blankney, Lincolnshire, she was the daughter of Henry Chaplin, landowner and Conservative politician and later the 1st Viscount Chaplin (1840–1923), and Lady Florence Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (1855–1881). After the death of her mother in 1881, Edith was raised largely at Dunrobin Castle, Sutherland, the estate of her maternal grandfather, the third Duke of Sutherland.\n\nIn 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, she was appointed the Colonel-in-Chief of the Women's Volunteer Reserve (WVR), a volunteer force formed of women replacing the men who had left work and gone up to the Front. The WVR was established in December 1914 in response to German bombing raids on East Coast towns during the First World War\n\nLady Londonderry also aided with the organisation of the Officers' Hospital set up in her house, and was the first woman to be appointed to be a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Military Division, upon the Order's establishment in 1917.\n\nLady Londonderry's friendship with Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, although platonic, was a source of gossip in her time and has since become an iconic friendship of English social history.\n\nWhen her father-in-law died in 1915, her husband inherited the title, whereupon Edith became Marchioness of Londonderry. This made her chatelaine of several large houses designed for entertaining, notably Londonderry House, the family's London townhouse in Mayfair, and Mount Stewart, the family seat in County Down. They also owned other properties such as Seaham Hall and Wynward Park in County Durham, and Plas Machynlleth in Wales.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Lady Londonderry created the gardens at the Londonderry family estate of Mount Stewart, near Newtownards, County Down. She added the Shamrock Garden, the Sunken Garden, increased the size of the lake, added a Spanish Garden with a small hut, the Italian Garden, the Dodo Terrace, Menagerie, the Fountain Pool and laid out walks in the Lily Wood and rest of the estate. This dramatic change led to the gardens being proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. She was a patron of the botanist and plant collector Frank Kingdon-Ward.\n\nAfter she created her garden and the death of her husband, she gave the gardens to the National Trust in 1957. They are regarded by Heritage Island as being one of the best gardens in the British Isles.\n\nOn 28 November 1899, she married Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh. They were both 21. She married into a prominent land-owning and political family. Her husband was a soldier in World War I and is best remembered for his tenure as Secretary of State for Air in the 1930s, preserving the Royal Air Force against cuts, and for his praise of Nazi Germany in the 1930s. He was forced out of the government in 1935 and never returned. Together, they were the parents of five children:\n\n\nOn the death of the 7th Marquess, in 1949, Lady Londonderry became \"Dowager Marchioness of Londonderry\".

It adjoins Woburn Sands in the Borough of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. It is centred east southeast of Milton Keynes and south of the M1 junction 13. It has its own railway station, three stops from Bletchley, and an historic centre with 29 listed buildings.\n\n\"Asperele\" and \"Aspel\" are recorded in Letter Patents, Assize Rolls and such documents of the 13th century, with the names \"Aspelegise\" appearing in the following century.\n\nThe name derives from \"Aspenlea\" meaning the aspen clearing – and from the late medieval period, \"of the de Guise family\".\n\nThe first record of Aspley dates from 969, when land there comprising 15 hides was granted by King Edgar (the Peaceable) to his thegn (thain) Alfwold.\n\nBy the date of the Domesday Book, 1086, the parish had 25 households, five of which were recorded as serfs. The book notes it covered a large tract of agricultural land, valued at £10 to its overlords, though rendering only £8, and was held before the conquest by Leofeva of Earl Waltheof. Its contemporary manor owner was Acard of Ivry who held of Hugh de Beauchamp, its feudal overlord.\n\nIn total were 12 ploughlands (larger than average), 10 ploughs of meadow, woodland producing 50 hogs per year, one mill; the book records no church at that date.\n\nIts church is mentioned in the records of the diocese in 1223.\n\nMost of the cultivated land was held by the manor in the medieval period. This stayed in Acard's family until his descendant, Reginald de Ivri granted a lease to Falkes de Breauté. On confiscation of Falkes's estates in 1225 King Henry III granted the rest of the lease to Henry de Capella, however by 1227 a certain \"Reginald de St. Valery\" was free to release the land (entire fee) to his regent, now Henry was a 20-year-old adult, Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent, with an official approval (confirmation of alienation).\n\nSimilarly however, in 1233 the King confiscated his lands, however Hubert was restored to all his wealth the following year in the Testa de Nevill. By 1267 it is established in the royal returns and copies (literally, rolls) of letters that he had subinfeudated the manor to Anselm de Gyse, in return for knight's service to John de Burgh and heirs.\n\nAfter the middle of the 14th century the heirs of Hubert de Burgh in Aspley seem to have lapsed, and the manor was held directly of the barony of Bedford.\n\nThe tenancy was in this period that of de Guise. Anselm died in 1295 left as heir a son John, then aged 17 – his descendants inherited this tenancy and became direct tenants as mentioned. In 1428 the lord of the manor's lord briefly changed to Giles Bridges, who had married Catherine Gyse, widow, of the previous lord, Reginald Gyse, however this was brief.\n\nNonetheless, Catherine had from her first marriage, male issue and the House of Gyse remained with the manor's possession. As such, Sir John Gyse created a knight by Prince Arthur (Tudor), died holding Aspley Guise Manor in 1501.\n\nIn 1541, the manor of Aspley Guise was annexed to the newly formed honour of Ampthill, which in 1551 was granted for life to Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth I).\n\nAn extent of the manor in 1560 mentions two windmills, but none survive in the historic ecclesiastical parish.\nIn 1560 she gave this asset by royal grant to Sir Richard Lee, military engineer: summarised as being worth a fairly average £14 13s. d., &c. (i.e. additionally, impecunious benefits accrued) per year. His daughter Ann, later Mrs Ralph Norwich, received permission to alienate (sell) the manor to Francis Bury, whose heir, Frances, by arrangement or fate married Ann's grandson, Thomas Lee Sadleir.\n\nThe estate passed down in a straightforward line of Sadleirs to Richard Vernon Sadleir who died in 1810, whose sister Ursula Moody inherited it. The owner in 1912 was accordingly her descendant, a certain Mr F. Moody.\n\nThe current manor house was built about 1700.\n\nAs to the church lands and tithes, in 1317 a further confirmation of Simon de Beauchamp's grant of the church and two parts of the tithes was made in favour of Newnham Priory. In 1544, these lands and the advowson were released by John Gyse and Anselm his son and heir to the Crown. In the similarly timed Dissolution of the Chantries (one year before its famed successor) an acre here was appropriated by the crown and its proceeds given to fund a new church window. What remained of the rectory was consolidated the vicarage of Husborne Crawley in 1796 and re-established half a century later.\n\nThe Town Close, administered by the ecclesiastical parish, containing awarded under the Inclosure Act 1761, by 1912 still produced for the poor agricultural produce worth £8 18s. a year, which was expended from time to time on its produce growers' work.\n\nIn the early 20th century large brickworks, with clay extraction was the main industry in the parish itself, having ceased by that century the extraction of fuller's earth, on which profit was no longer possible. Agriculture, as today formed a minority of employment.\n\nThe Rookery, a secluded Victorian mansion in Church Street, was used by intelligence operatives during the Second World War for black propaganda against Germany controlled by Sefton Delmer.\n\nAspley has three historic houses of higher architectural classification. Its church, equally, is Grade II* listed. The garden walls and gateway of Aspley House are listed in an entry separate from it, giving 30 structures in all identified by English Heritage as worthy of listing.\n\nThe medieval Anglican church is dedicated to St Botolph and was reworked extensively in the early and late 19th century.\n\nIts tower has six bells. Its southern window of a nativity screen was installed during the last major series of renovations and is described by the church as \"very fine\".\n\nThe north aisle has a 15th-century traceried screen, a similarly dated circular font and a tomb chest with effigy of knight, probably Sir William Tyrington, estimated to date to c.1400. In this floor are typical brasses, one to John Danvers or Daweners, rector, c.1410, another c.1500, probably to Sir John de Gyse/Guise.\n\nThis was built in 1695 in the style of Sir Christopher Wren and altered c. 1750 and again later. In 1912 this house still contained many fine portraits of the Hervey and Chernock families.\n\nIn the 18th century, Guise House and its grounds were home to (Aspley) Classical Academy until 1845, a school at its peak rated to rival Eton and Harrow. It has above its façade a Greek-style open pediment with windows in its tympanum (triangular area). It has a stone parapet tower.\n\nThe Old House is timber-frame (of typical Tudor architectural construction) and dates from 1575 with some Georgian alterations.\nThe village has 26 other examples of listed architecture, many of them early Georgian.\n\nThe village is served by Aspley Guise railway station, a small station on the Marston Vale Line running between Bedford and Bletchley.\n\nThe southwestern area, which includes Aspley Wood has substantial pine trees, the west has a public golf course, accessed from either road to Woburn Sands village. In the northern part crops are grown. Aspley Heath, once part of the parish, is now its own village and civil parish and is south of Aspley Wood, relatively distant to the south-west.\n\nElevations range from 75m AOD at the northern boundary marked by the middle of the M1 (with side-by-side, parallel, local road the A422), to the start of village centre which is at between 84m (at the station) and 124m at the Common Farm and Golf course in the southwest, just below which to two sides is most of the village. Streets are steepest between the station developed area and the historic upland area. A spring rises on this slope, east of Church Street, the single road scaling the slope.\n\nThe parish is today relatively small compared to others and has kept to a main north-south development, with buffer zones and recreational areas to either side – see linear development.\n\nThe 'Aspley Guise triangle' is its northern area of farmland bounded by the A421 to the north and north-east and the Marston Vale line to the south (which separates it from the developed and recreational areas of Aspley Guise) and Cranfield Road to the west. It had been named with this term in the regional body's Expansion plans for Milton Keynes and identified as an appropriate possibility, being served by a railway station. In the ministerial ruling on the plan, this area was excluded on the technicality that it is not part of the South East of England Region, though with a hint that it might appear again in an East of England regional spatial strategy, which had its own fulfilled plans.\n\nFollowing the 2010 United Kingdom general election, the coalition government cancelled its predecessor's regional housing targets and bodies. The Local Authority (Central Bedfordshire Council) has since put forward a Local Plan that identifies this area of land for development of 3,000 homes plus facilities.\n\nAspley Guise is centred about south-east of Milton Keynes and south-west of the M1 motorway's junction 13. It has access to both via uncategorised local roads.\n\nAspley Guise railway station is on the Marston Vale line between and and has trains hourly Monday-Saturday. It is three calling points east of Bletchley for interchange with local services on the West Coast Main Line.\n\n"}

{"id": "1910923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910923", "title": "Adrian Moorhouse", "text": "Adrian Moorhouse\n\nAdrian David Moorhouse MBE (born 24 May 1964) is an English former competitive swimmer who dominated British swimming in the late 1980s. He won the gold medal in the 100-metre breaststroke at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea. Since then Moorhouse, a former pupil of Bradford Grammar School, has translated his sporting success to a successful career in the business world, as managing director of Lane4, a consultancy helping individuals and teams around the world reach their fullest potential.\n\nHe was voted Best Leader at the \"Sunday Times\" Best Small Companies to Work for in 2009 and 2007 and has been listed in HR Magazine's Most Influential UK Thinkers since 2010. He is also a swimming commentator for BBC television.\n\nMoorhouse was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, attended Bradford Grammar School and went to 4th Shipley Scouts.\nMoorhouse's inspiration to become seriously involved in national and international competitive swimming came at the age of 12 when he watched David Wilkie win gold at the Montreal Olympics. In 1980 he was selected for the England Junior team and broke the national junior records for both the 100 m and 200 m breaststroke. When he was 15, he was chosen for the national senior squad, number two to the gold medallist at the Moscow Olympics, Duncan Goodhew.\n\nMoorhouse became Britain's number one breaststroke swimmer in 1981 when he won a bronze medal for the 200 m in the European Championships in Yugoslavia. The following year he gained his first taste of gold after winning the 100 m breaststroke at the Commonwealth Games in Australia, in a new British Record of 1:02.93, along with a bronze in the 200m breaststroke. In the World Championships in Guayaquil shortly afterwards, he missed bronze by just 2/100th of a second in the 100m breaststroke behind (future) 1984 Olympic Champions Steve Lundquist (USA) and Victor Davis (CAN), and future world record holder John Moffet (USA). The following year he was back to winning ways taking gold in the 200m breaststroke at the 1983 European Championships in Rome together with a silver in the 100m.\n\nAt the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984, Moorhouse was tipped for a gold medal in the 100 m breaststroke but missed out completely, coming fourth behind Steve Lundquist of the USA who won gold in a new world record of 1:01.65 swimming in the adjacent lane. \"I was devastated\", he says. \"After the Games I convinced myself that I had no talent and that I was never going to win again. I didn't want anything to do with swimming.”\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1984, Moorhouse stayed home alone to reflect and decided to train for a competition in April 1985 as a 'last roll of the dice' to see whether he had what it took to conquer the world. His decision was vindicated when he broke the World Short Course (25 m pool) record for the 100 m in a time of 1:00.58, and went on to win the European Championships gold medal in Bulgaria in a time of 1:02.99.\n\nThe year 1986 was a bittersweet one for Moorhouse. At the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, he narrowly took silver in the 100m breaststroke behind long-time rival Victor Davis of Canada. However, he put his disappointment behind him to turn the tables on Davis in the 200m breaststroke a few days later, an event in which the Canadian had been heavily favoured as the reigning Olympic Champion and world record holder. Overtaking Davis in the second half of the race, Moorhouse took gold in a personal best and new English record of 2:16.35.\n\nA month later in Madrid, Moorhouse qualified fastest for the 100m breaststroke final at the World Championships in a new European record of 1:02.28. In the final, he powered to the front in the second 50m to beat Victor Davis convincingly and win the race in another European record of 1:02.01. However, he was then controversially disqualified for an alleged dolphin kick at the turn, promoting Davis to gold. (FINA, swimming's world governing body, changed the breaststroke rules in 2005 to permit a single dolphin kick at the start and turn in recognition of the fact that this is often an unintended and involuntary reaction to the underwater pullout.) Despite his natural disappointment, though, Moorhouse finished the year ranked first in the world for the 100m breaststroke for the first time, a position he retained for the next four years.\n\nIn 1987, putting the Madrid episode behind him, Moorhouse set a world short-course record, in a competition in Bonn, by becoming the first person to swim 100 m breaststroke in less than a minute, out-swimming the former world record holder, Rolf Beab in a time of 59.75 s. Later that year, at the European Championships in Strasbourg, Moorhouse retained his 100m title in a new European record of 1:02.13, before taking bronze in the 200m breaststroke in a personal best of 2:15.78 for good measure.\n\nMoorhouse started Olympic year, 1988, on the right note by winning the 100 m breaststroke at the US Indoor Championships to confirm his status as number one in the world. In September he achieved a lifetime's ambition at Seoul when, following in the footsteps of David Wilkie and Duncan Goodhew, he won Olympic gold in the 100 m breaststroke in a time of 1:02.04, overtaking Dmitry Volkov (URS) and Károly Güttler (HUN) at the wall, in a characteristic finishing surge, to win by 1/100th of a second in the closest race of those Olympics.\n\nHaving finally achieved his Olympic dream, Moorhouse entered 1989 with an aura of invincibility. In the heats of the 100m breaststroke at the European Championships in Bonn, he achieved another lifetime's ambition when he set a new world record of 1:01.49. Notably, he broke the record set by Steve Lundquist in the 1984 Olympics, in the lane adjacent to Moorhouse, adding extra significance to his achievement. In the final, he secured his hat-trick of European golds in this event, winning in 1:01.71.\n\nIn 1990, he equaled his own 100m breaststroke world record of 1:01.49 twice: first, to win gold at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland; and second, in the summer's British Championships at a time when the World Championships had initially been scheduled. However, due to the host city Perth (AUS) being in the Southern Hemisphere, the World Championships were postponed until January 1991 to coincide with summer. Here, Moorhouse swam another fantastic time of 1:01.58 but had to settle for silver behind a new world record and breakthrough performance from Hungary's Norbert Rózsa. (It is worth noting that the FINA World Championships were moved from a four-year cycle to a two-year cycle a decade later. Had that been the case in the late 1980s, then Moorhouse may well have won two world titles given that he was ranked first in the world for the five-year period from 1986 to 1990.)\nLater in 1991, he again took silver behind Norbert Rózsa in the European Championships in Athens in a time of 1:01.89, his final major medal and his fifth consecutive podium placing in this event. The following year, he qualified for the final of the 100m breaststroke at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, but faded in the final to finish 8th to draw the curtain on his illustrious career.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Adrian Moorhouse was one of Britain's most successful sportspeople, finishing as runner-up in the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year contest in 1988 following his Olympic win. His achievements continued the tradition of successful British men's breaststroke swimming that had started with Olympic golds from David Wilkie in 1976 and Duncan Goodhew in 1980. Moorhouse himself then inspired a new generation of British male breaststroke swimmers, starting with his domestic rival, double Olympic medalist Nick Gillingham, through to 2003 World Champion James Gibson, and more recently 2012 Olympic silver medalist Michael Jamieson, and, most notably, reigning Olympic, World, European, and Commonwealth Champion and world record holder in the 50m and 100m breaststroke, Adam Peaty, on whose 2016 Olympic victory Moorhouse commentated for BBC television alongside his former Olympic teammate and butterfly medalist Andy Jameson.\n\nThroughout his career he regularly participated in the ASA National Championships and won 16 titles. The 50 metres breaststroke title in 1991 and 1992, the 100 metres breaststroke title in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990 and 1991 and the 200 metres breaststroke title in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985 and 1986.\n\nCanadian Victor Davis first encountered Moorhouse at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane when Davis took gold in the 200 m breaststroke, and Moorhouse took the gold in the 100 m breaststroke. They met again later at the 1982 World Championships in Guayaquil, Ecuador, but this time Davis had the upper hand in both events, taking the gold in the 200 m and silver in the 100 m. Moorhouse, also in his first World Championships, finished 5th in the 100 m, and 7th in the 200 m.\n\nTheir next encounter was at the 1984 Olympics and it seemed that both their chances were enhanced by the boycott of East Germany and the Soviet Union. The 1984 Games were perhaps Victor Davis' finest competition, as he took gold in the 200 m and silver in the 100 m. Meanwhile, Moorhouse suffered badly. Having had severe tonsillitis just days before the start of the Games, he finished 4th in the 100 m and 6th in the 200 m. Davis, now at the pinnacle of his swimming career, was voted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame.\nAt the time of the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, Victor Davis took gold in the 100 m event. Now the European Champion, Moorhouse, surprised Davis by sneaking the gold in the 200 m event.\n\nBy the time of the 1986 World Championships in Madrid, the world swimming media were hyping up the 100 m breaststroke event as 'the event of the championships', knowing that it would inevitably prove to be another great battle between Davis and Moorhouse. Davis couldn't contain Moorhouse over the final 25 m, and Moorhouse took the 100 m gold in a new European Record of 1.02.01 secs. Davis took the silver in 1:02.71.\n\nThe officials disqualified Moorhouse for an 'illegal turn', claiming he had used a butterfly kicking action during the underwater phase of the 50 m turn. TV crews from around the world began to analyse the footage of the 'illegal turn' from all conceivable angles, but each time it looked perfectly sound.\n\nThe call of the 'turn judge' was upheld on appeal and Davis was awarded the gold medal. Davis went on to take silver in the 200 m breaststroke – beaten by Hungarian József Szabó. Moorhouse withdrew from the 200 m event with a strained adductor muscle. The final encounter between Davis and Moorhouse at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, which proved to be Davis' final international competition. Both had announced before the Games that the 100 m event would be their main priority. Davis had performed poorly at the Canadian Olympic Trials, and had not been selected for the 200 m breaststroke, while Moorhouse was ranked number one in the world, and his lifetime best of 1:01.78 was close to the world record 1:01.65.\n\nDavis, still the Canadian record holder at 1:01.99, was only ranked 6th in the world going into the 1988 Olympics and no-one really knew what kind of shape he was going to be in. In the morning heats, Davis looked very impressive. He led the field from the start, and easily won his heat in a time of 1:02.48. Moorhouse was able to qualify in a faster time, winning his heat in 1:02.19. After one false start, Moorhouse looked the more nervous of the two behind the starting blocks. Meanwhile, Davis looked calm. At the second start, both Davis and Dmitri Volkov of the USSR began strongly, leaving Moorhouse slightly trailing. Volkov opened a 2-metre lead over the first 50 m, and Davis was matched stroke for stroke by Moorhouse. Volkov touched first at the 50 m mark in 28.12 s, setting a new 50 metre breaststroke world record. Moorhouse turned 6th in 29.42 s, and Davis turned 7th in 29.46 s. Volkov extended his lead, and as he reached the 75 m mark, he looked a certainty for the gold medal. He was 3–4 metres ahead of Moorhouse, Davis and Károly Güttler of Hungary. At this point Davis and Moorhouse closed in on Volkov. Moorhouse took the gold in 1:02.04, just ahead of Guttler's time of 1:02.05. The bronze medal was won by Volkov, in a time of 1:02.20, leaving Davis in 4th place, with a time of 1:02.38.\n\nIn 1989 Moorhouse was appointed MBE. He remained as the world number one until 1991 but at the Barcelona Olympic Games he finished eighth in the final and soon retired from swimming.\n\nHe has since enjoyed a successful career as a Management Consultant, co-founding Lane4 in 1995, where he works with a wide range of organisations to help individuals and teams around the world reach their potential.\n\nMoorhouse was chosen as an official Team GB Ambassador for London 2012 Games and was also a torchbearer.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1910924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910924", "title": "River Ure", "text": "River Ure\n\nThe River Ure in North Yorkshire, England is approximately long from its source to the point where it changes name to the River Ouse. It is the principal river of Wensleydale, which is the only major dale now named after a village rather than its river. The old name for the valley was Yoredale after the river that runs through it.\n\nThe Ure is one of many rivers and waterways that drain the Dales into the River Ouse. Tributaries of the Ure include the River Swale and the River Skell.\n\nThe earliest recorded name of the river is in about 1025, probably an error for , where represents the Old English letter wynn or 'w', standing for (\"water\"). By 1140 it is recorded as \"Jor\", hence Jervaulx (Jorvale) Abbey, and a little later as \"Yore\". In Tudor times the antiquarians John Leland and William Camden used the modern form of the name.\n\nThe name probably means \"the strong or swift river\". This is on the assumption that the Brittonic name of the river was \"Isurā\", because the Roman name for Aldborough was \"Isurium\"; intervocalic \"s\" is known to have been lost in Brittonic at an early date. This explanation connects the river name with an Indo-European root \"is-\" meaning \"strong\" and the names of the Isar in Germany and the Isère in France.\n\nThe source of the river is Ure Head on Abbotside Common where it flows west south-west to the valley floor and then turns south. Where it reaches the A684 it turns east along Wensleydale as far as Wensley. From here it flows south-east to Jervaulx Abbey and shortly after south to Mickley. Here it returns east and then south to Ripon. A little way after Ripon it flows east again to Boroughbridge.\n\nTo the east of Boroughbridge, the Ure is joined by the River Swale. About downstream of this confluence, at Cuddy Shaw Reach near Linton-on-Ouse, the river changes its name to the River Ouse.\n\n\nUpper Wensleydale is high, open and remote U shaped valley overlying Yoredale Beds. The gradient is gentle to the north end of the valley, becoming steeper further south. Drumlins lay either side of the river, which is shallow but fast flowing. The river is fed from many gills cutting through woodland and predominantly sheep farmsteads. The Settle to Carlisle railway runs along the western side of the valley here.\n\nMid Wensleydale is made of Great Scar limestone under Yoredale beds that make up the valley sides which are marked with stepped limestone scars. The valley floor is made from glacial drift tails and moraine. The river here is broad and gently flowing in meanders in a stony channel. There are four tributary valleys that contribute to several waterfalls in this area.\n\nLower Wensleydale is a broader version of mid Wensleydale with the river gently meandering until it drops significantly at Aysgarth over the platformed waterfalls. The valley sides become increasingly wooded.\n\nFrom Middleham onwards the river is a typical mid-age river and meanders in wider arcs as it flows south-east.\n\nThe valley has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Examples of earthworks and other artifacts from the Bronze and Iron Ages can be seen in the Dales Countryside Museum in Hawes and the Romans built a fort at Bainbridge. Place-names in the valley denote the different types of settlers, such as Angles and Norse with typical suffixes like 'ton' and \"sett\".\n\nDuring medieval times, much of the upper dale was sheep country belonging to Middleham Castle and Jervaulx Abbey. \nIn 1751, the Richmond to Lancaster Turnpike was created and originally followed the Roman road from Bainbridge. In 1795 it was diverted along the valley to Hawes and took the Widdale route, now the B6255 to Ingleton.\n\nMore recently in 1990, Aysgarth Falls was used as a location in \"\", in the scene where Robin Hood fights Little John. It also featured in the 1992 film of \"Wuthering Heights\" and the 1984 TV miniseries, \"A Woman of Substance\".\n\nFarming, lead mining, dairying and quarrying are the mainstays of the modern economy of the valley, along with tourism. The dairy at Hawes produces Wensleydale cheese. Brewing takes place in Masham at the Black Sheep and Theakston Breweries.\n\nThere are many waymarked footpaths and open countryside. The Pennine Way passes through Hawes.\n\nThe River Ure is navigable upstream as far as its junction with the Ripon Canal, south east of Ripon, a distance of . There are locks at Milby, where a short cut bypasses the weir at Boroughbridge, and at Westwick.\n\nNavigation to Swale Nab, at the confluence with the River Swale, was opened in January 1769 as part of the River Ouse Navigation. Navigation to the Ripon Canal was opened in January 1772.\n\nThe Leeds and Thirsk Railway bought the navigation in January 1846. The navigation was neglected, and the lack of dredging resulted in boats having to be loaded with less cargo. There was a brief upturn in trade in the 1860s, but the decline continued after that. By 1892, no traffic proceeded past Boroughbridge, and the North Eastern Railway took action to prevent the waterway above Boroughbridge being used.\n\nUntil 1999 the navigation authority to Swale Nab was the Linton Lock Navigation Commissioners. The Commissioners had insufficient income to maintain the navigation, and in 1999 it was transferred to British Waterways. The navigation authority for the whole navigation is now the Canal & River Trust.\n\nThe differing habitats of the area have their own populations of flora such as cranesbill, bistort, pignut and buttercup. Other species that can be seen in the area are wood anemones, violets, primroses, purple orchids, cowslips and herb paris. Some plants, such as spring sandwort, have managed to grow where the lead mining took place. There are large populations of badgers, roe deer, red foxes and rabbits in the valley. Among the variety of birds that can be seen in the valley are golden plovers, curlews and oystercatchers. Fish populations along the river include: Brown Trout, Grayling, Barbel, Chub, Roach and Perch.\n\nFrom the source of the river:\n\nFrom the source of the river:\n\nFrom the source of the river:\n"}
{"id": "1910927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910927", "title": "Repressor lexA", "text": "Repressor lexA\n\nRepressor LexA or LexA is a transcriptional repressor () that represses SOS response genes coding primarily for error-prone DNA polymerases, DNA repair enzymes and cell division inhibitors. LexA forms \"de facto\" a two-component regulatory system with RecA, which senses DNA damage at stalled replication forks, forming monofilaments and acquiring an active conformation capable of binding to LexA and causing LexA to cleave itself, in a process called autoproteolysis.\n\nDNA damage can be inflicted by the action of antibiotics, bacteriophages, and UV light. Of potential clinical interest is the induction of the SOS response by antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin. Bacteria require topoisomerases such as DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV for DNA replication. Antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin are able to prevent the action of these molecules by attaching themselves to the gyrate–DNA complex, leading to replication fork stall and the induction of the SOS response. The expression of error-prone polymerases under the SOS response increases the basal mutation rate of bacteria. While mutations are often lethal to the cell, they can also enhance survival. In the specific case of topoisomerases, some bacteria have mutated one of their amino acids so that the ciprofloxacin can only create a weak bond to the topoisomerase. This is one of the methods that bacteria use to become resistant to antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin treatment can therefore potentially lead to the generation of mutations that may render bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin. In addition, ciprofloxacin has also been shown to induce via the SOS response dissemination of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance determinants, as well as the activation of integron integrases, potentially increasing the likelihood of acquisition and dissemination of antibiotic resistance by bacteria.\n\nImpaired LexA proteolysis has been shown to interfere with ciprofloxacin resistance. This offers potential for combination therapy that combines quinolones with strategies aimed at interfering with the action of LexA, either directly or via RecA.\n\nLexA contains a DNA binding domain. The winged HTH motif of LexA is a variant form of the helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif, and it is usually located at the N-terminus of the protein.\n"}

{"id": "1910950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910950", "title": "Kirkwall Ba game", "text": "Kirkwall Ba game\n\nThe Kirkwall Ba Game (also spelled The ba') is one of the main annual events held in the town of Kirkwall, in Orkney, Scotland. It is one of a number of Ba Games played in the streets of towns around Scotland; these are examples of games which are still played in towns in the United Kingdom and worldwide. Games are played twice a year, normally on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.\n\nPlayed in the Royal Burgh of Kirkwall, the two sides are the Uppies and the Doonies, or more correctly, \"Up-the-Gates\" and \"Doon-the-Gates\" from Norn \"gata\" (path or road), although it is also common in Scots. The tradition belongs to Kirkwall and the surrounding area of St Ola, and has always been played by men from those two areas since before records began. In the past 50 years, mainly due to improved transport, the game's popularity has grown to include players from all areas of Orkney, including some of the outer isles. This has not met with universal approval from those associated with the game as its sheer size is becoming a problem from a safety perspective.\n\nScant information is available about the early history but some form of mass football appears to have been practised throughout Scotland and England for at least three centuries. Records from 1797 indicate that \"Football is the principal diversion of the common people, which they practise with great dexterity\". There is speculation that the game in Kirkwall may have its roots in folklore based on the tale of Sigurd and the \"Orkneyinga saga\".\n\nThe Boys Ba', as the name suggests, is restricted to those aged 15 years and below. There is no restriction on the lower age limit and small boys of sometimes as young as 5 years old can be seen around the edges, making their first tentative steps into the game. The Boys Ba' is thrown up from the Merket Cross on the Kirk Green on front of St Magnus Cathedral at 10.00, the start time recently having been moved from 10.30 due to the Boys Ba' having a tendency to last longer. The Boys game, like the Men's, has grown in size and popularity in recent years and the number of boys participating can number over 100.\n\nThe Boys Ba' has been known to last as little as 4 minutes (New Years Day 1985) or as long as 6 hours (New Years Day 2019). It can be very fluid, with its outcome often decided by a \"break\" whereby one of the faster boys manages to break free of the scrum and runs with the Ba, making valuable ground, sometimes making it all the way to his team's goal, thereby ending the game. Boy's Ba winners, in the sense of the individual boy who is awarded the Ba' after the game as his personal property, will normally be boys playing in their final games prior to turning 16 years old, although there are occasions in history where a younger boy has managed to make off home with it, thereby claiming the Ba as his, despite having further years left to play in the boys game. Nowadays this is generally frowned upon, the conventional wisdom being that younger boys will have other chances to win a Ba, whereas the 15‑year‑olds will not.\n\nAlthough a great honour, winning a Boy's Ba does not affect status when moving up to the men's game. All young players are considered equal and must prove themselves on their individual performances in the Men's Ba. Indeed, many players who were prominent in the boy's game prove to be otherwise when they step up to the Men's game, and vice versa.\n\nThe Men's Ba' is thrown up also from the Merket Cross, when the cathedral bell strikes 13:00. The person chosen to \"throw up\" the Ba, or begin the game, is usually an older Ba' stalwart, but the honour is occasionally given to some local public figure.\n\nThe waiting scrum can number up to 350 men and can be a sight to behold. Once thrown up, the Ba' disappears into the scrum and much surging play occurs while the two sides weigh each other up and determine who has the weight on their side on this occasion. Much exciting surging and turning play often occurs on this wider part of the street, which can frequently determine the final outcome.\n\nOccasionally the Ba appears out of the scrum and someone makes a dash through the crowds of spectators. To the casual onlooker this can happen at any moment, but the seasoned Ba watcher can often see what is happening long before the Ba suddenly erupts. Breaks sometimes occur on Broad Street, but can occur anywhere where one side gains sufficient control of part of the scrum.\n\nThe Doonies have the benefit of a flat push to Albert Street, while the Uppies have a hard push up to the top of Tankerness Lane. The game may also go down one of the flagstone lanes, or down Castle Street onto the open Junction Road. Once there either side may gain the upper hand by means of a smuggle and run, or the scrum may become immobile in one of the many closes and yards.\n\nHowever, if the Uppies manage to enter Victoria Street, or the Doonies Albert Street, the opposition have a much harder time, due to the narrowness and the press of often many hundreds of keen spectators. All the same the Ba may be restricted for several hours in any of the many lanes and neither side ever gives up the struggle until the goal is reached.\n\nImmediately after the end of World War II there was a movement to establish a Ba game for women in Kirkwall. There were only ever two Women's Ba games played, on Christmas Day 1945 and New Years Day 1946. The first ever winner of the women's Ba was Barbara Yule who was an uppie. Following her death in 1999 the ball she had kept since she won was returned to Orkney and is on display in Orkney museum in Kirkwall. The second winner was Violet Couper who was also an uppie. The two games played did not follow the pattern of the men's game and were very much running games. The women's game was abolished in subsequent years. History records the reasons for its discontinuation as being a general public dislike for female participation in a very physical and public spectacle, the attitudes of the time being that it was not \"lady-like\".\n\nThe Doonies' goal is the sea, normally within the Basin of the Harbour, but so long as it is immersed in the salt water of Kirkwall Bay, the Ba has gone doon. The Uppies must round the Lang, or Mackinson's corner at the junction of Main Street with New Scapa Road, opposite the Catholic Church, which was the site of the old town gates in bygone times. (The last remains of the town gates were removed in the 1950s, leaving the Uppie goal as the gable end of a house on Mackinson's Corner.)\n\nOnce the Ba has been goaled Up or Doon, lengthy argument often ensues among players on the winning side before a popular individual winner is acclaimed. This winner is awarded the trophy of the game, which is the Ba itself. When the winner is finally decided, he is normally held aloft and carried shoulder-high from the goal by his teammates in celebration, passing into the ranks of Ba winners and into Kirkwall history.\n\nTo stalwart Ba players the ultimate honour is to be awarded a Ba. To have any chance of this honour, a player generally has to have played consistently well for a long period of time (usually around 20 years minimum). Ba winners range from outstanding players in their early thirties to veterans in their mid to late forties.\n\nThere are several players who are what is known as a \"double winner\" in that they have been awarded both a Boys' Ba and a Men's Ba during their playing careers.\n\nOriginally the side any individual played on was decided by whether he was born up or doon the gate but when Kirkwall's Balfour Hospital was built in the 1950s, the majority of babies were born there, thus giving a heavy bias to the Uppies. This led to a swing toward family allegiances, meaning players played the same way as their forebears. This tradition continues to this day. For non-Orcadians or \"ferryloupers\" (incomers) or indeed anyone with no family history in the game, and often people from the isles or rural areas, their side is determined by the route taken on their first arrival in Kirkwall.\n\nThe game has no official rules, but there is a code of honour among players whereby certain acts are considered strictly unacceptable. This code is generally adhered to extremely well by those who play the game and as result the game is self-regulating and self-policing, requiring no intervention from outside parties.\n\nThe game's popularity in recent times has led to the scrum of men becoming very large with up to 350 men playing at any one time. Forces within the scrum can be enormous, with broken and cracked ribs not uncommon. The scrum will collapse often during the game, at which point players are generally very good at ceasing play and aiding teammate and opponent alike to regain their feet.\n\nCamaraderie within the game is excellent, although as with any highly physical male pursuit, tempers can and do flare. Such incidents are quickly extinguished by fellow players and grudges are not held.\n\nThe participation of visitors in the game is not encouraged, mainly for safety reasons but also as Orcadians are very protective of their tradition and do not wish to see it become a pursuit for \"adventure tourists\" as has happened with several other UK traditional ball games. The current scrum has become very large and those associated with the game believe that further players, particularly ones who have no appreciation of the dangers, tactics, allegiances or history of the game, will be no asset from a safety point of view. This view is endorsed almost universally throughout the game.\n\nCitations\n"}

Poison control centers answer questions about potential poisons in addition to providing treatment management advice about household products, medicines, pesticides, plants, bites and stings, food poisoning, and fumes. In the US, more than 72% of poison exposure cases are managed simply by phone, greatly reducing the need for costly emergency department and doctor visits.\n\nAfter World War II there was a proliferation of new drugs and chemicals in the marketplace, and consequently suicide and childhood poisonings from these agents drastically increased. Around this time up to half of all accidents in children were poisonings with a substantial number of fatalities. These factors led to the medical community developing a response to both unintentional and intentional poisonings. In Europe in the late 1940s special toxicology wards were set up; initial wards were started in Copenhagen and Budapest, and the Netherlands began a poison information service.\n\nIn the United States during the 1930s, Louis Gdalman, a pharmacist knowledgeable in the chemistry of harmful substances, set up a poison information service at St. Luke's Hospital (Chicago, Illinois). He became known around Chicago and the country as the person to contact in a poisoning case and would take calls at home around the clock. In the late 1940s, Gdalman began to organize the poison information onto note cards and created a standardized form to collect new information on new toxic substances. By 1953 he had collected an extensive library of information on thousands of poisons and he established the first Poison Control Center along with Edward Press. By 1957 there were 17 poison control centers in the U.S., with the Chicago center serving as a model; these centers dealt mainly with physician enquiries by giving ingredient and toxicity information about products, along with treatment recommendations. Over time the poison control centers started taking calls from the general public. The majority of poison centers were not part of a patient treatment facility; they strictly provided information.\n\nIn 1958 the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) was founded to promote cooperation between poison centers in different cities and to standardize the operation of these centers. An additional part of the AAPCC's activities was poison prevention and education programs for both physicians and the general public. In 1968 the American Academy of Clinical Toxicologists (AACT) was established by a group of medical doctors. The AACT's main objective was to apply principles of toxicology to patient treatment and improve the standard of care on a national basis. In the 1960s and 1970s a rapid proliferation of poison centers emerged and by 1978 there were 661 centers in the USA. This trend reversed during the 1980s and 1990s with a number of centers closing or merging. In 2000 there were 51 certified centers in the USA. Today there are 55 centers operating in the US.\n\nA similar movement evolved in Europe but unlike the American movement the majority were centralized toxicology treatment centers with integrated poison information centers. The French developed an inpatient unit for the treatment of poisoned patients in the late 1950s. In England the National Poison Information Service was developed at Guy's Hospital under Dr Roy Goulding. At around the same time Dr Henry Mathew started a poison treatment center in Edinburgh. In 1964 the European Association for Poison Control Centers was formed at Tours, France. Australasian centers were also established in the 1960s. The New Zealand center started in Dunedin in December 1964, while in Australia, the New South Wales Poisons Information Center was established in 1966.\n\nPoison control centers provide excellent service and savings. Recent research shows that every dollar invested in the poison center system saves $13.39 in health care costs and productivity.\n\nWhile poison control centers have traditionally provided expert consultations by telephone, on 30 December 2014 an online option was launched by a group of U.S. poison centers to meet the growing demand for accurate web-based health information. Based on age, weight and substance implicated, it provides case-specific guidance for poison exposures – limited to unintentional, single ingestions of medicines, household products or berries in asymptomatic individuals. The application uses ingredient-based algorithms to generate a recommendation including whether an emergency department visit or call to poison control is required. If it's safe to stay home, then home treatment recommendations, specific symptoms to expect, and symptoms of greater concern that would require a call to poison control or a visit to an emergency department are outlined. Article 45 of the CLP Regulation places the duty upon Member States to appoint \"bodies responsible for receiving information relating to emergency health response\". These appointed bodies are often known as Poison Centres.\n\nThe Belgian Antipoison Centre (Centre Antipoisons in French, Antigifcentrum in Dutch) is tasked with receiving and answering urgent calls for medical advice regarding cases of poisoning 24/7 and throughout the year. Its hotline can be reached on the telephone number 070 245 245 in Belgium and is available to both medical professionals and the general public. To be able to answer the calls qualitatively, the Antipoison Centre manages a database with formulas of dangerous mixtures provided by the industry, and a database of relevant scientific literature in the field of toxicology. The Antipoison Centre is also responsible for keeping a stock of certain rare or expensive antidotes, and managing a network of hospital pharmacies that also have certain antidotes in stock. Lastly, the Antipoison Centre has a mission of toxicovigilance, meaning it warns relevant authorities (such as the FPS Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment or the FAMHP) about new and emerging risks of chemicals and pharmaceuticals involved in cases of poisoning. Since 2015, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has an agreement with Belgium to have the Antipoison Centre also function as the poison control center for Luxembourg. Medical professionals and members of the public from Luxembourg can reach the Antipoison Centre on the telephone number 8002 5500.\n\nGerman states designate poison control centers. There are currently 8 different centers, some of them serving several states. Poison Centers in Germany\n\nThe Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) (National Institute of Health) is responsible for poison control in Italy.\n\nThe National Poisons Information Centre (NVIC) of the University Medical Center Utrecht provides a 24/7 hotline service (030-2748888), staffed by poison information specialists (SPIs). It is open to medical professionals only and is not available to the general public.\n\nSince 2011 the NVIC also provides a web-based exposure analysis and poison information system. As with the webPOISONCONTROL system, this is a free-of-charge, fully confidential web application that enables medical professionals to quickly and efficiently assess the potential risks of (mixed) exposures, as well as their clinical signs and symptoms, and possible therapeutic interventions. As with the other online options worldwide, it remains advisable to consult the NVIC if the exposure is to a larger number of substances.\n\nThe NVIC can, on request, also provide specific training to emergency medical personnel (GMTs), emergency departments, physicians and their assistants, and other interested parties with regards to exposure prevention and management.\n\nThe NVIC was part of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment until 2011. It was then transferred to the University Medical Center Utrecht.\n\nThe Poison Control Centre of Ain Shams University (PCC-ASU) was established in 1981. It is one of the earliest poisoning treatment facilities to be established in the Middle East. It has its own inpatient department, ICU and Analytical Toxicology unit. It serves between 20 and 25 thousand cases a year.\n\nThe Palestinian Poison Control and Drug Information Centre was established in 2006, by Ansam Sawalha.\n\nThe poison control department in King Fahad Medical City provides its service for healthcare professionals 24/7 throughout the year.\n\nThe National Poisons Information Service (NPIS) provides toxicological information to health professionals to ensure patients receive appropriate treatment. NPIS do not take calls from the general public, who are instead advised to contact the non-emergency 111 number for specific information on poisons, or 999 in an emergency.\n\nThe American Association of Poison Control Centers manages a 24-hour hotline (1-800-222-1222), which is continuously staffed by pharmacists, physicians, nurses, and poison information specialists who have received dedicated training in the field of toxicology. Calls to the number are automatically routed to the poison control center that covers the territory from which the call is placed. It has a TTY/TDD number for the hearing impaired. Poison educators across the country also offer poison prevention training and education sessions to community institutions, along with educational materials.\n\nA worldwide directory of poison centers is available from the World Health Organization's website.\n\nIndia\n\nIn April 2018, a Poison Information Center was established in Kolkata, in the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology at R. G. Kar Medical College. The Center usually caters to patients as well as the doctors from the entire state of West Bengal, in addition to other parts of India. The toll free number is 1800 345 0033.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1910981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910981", "title": "Marine protected area", "text": "Marine protected area\n\nMarine protected areas (MPA) are protected areas of seas, oceans, estuaries or in the US, the Great Lakes . These marine areas can come in many forms ranging from wildlife refuges to research facilities. MPAs restrict human activity for a conservation purpose, typically to protect natural or cultural resources. Such marine resources are protected by local, state, territorial, native, regional, national, or international authorities and differ substantially among and between nations. This variation includes different limitations on development, fishing practices, fishing seasons and catch limits, moorings and bans on removing or disrupting marine life. In some situations (such as with the Phoenix Islands Protected Area), MPAs also provide revenue for countries, potentially equal to the income that they would have if they were to grant companies permissions to fish.\n\nOn 28 October 2016 in Hobart, Australia, the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources agreed to establish the first Antarctic and largest marine protected area in the world encompassing 1.55 million km (600,000 sq mi) in the Ross Sea. Other large MPAs are in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans, in certain exclusive economic zones of Australia and overseas territories of France, the United Kingdom and the United States, with major ( or larger) new or expanded MPAs by these nations since 2012—such as Natural Park of the Coral Sea, Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands Marine Protected Area. When counted with MPAs of all sizes from many other countries, as of August 2016 there are more than 13,650 MPAs, encompassing 2.07% of the world's oceans, with half of that area – encompassing 1.03% of the world's oceans – receiving complete \"no-take\" designation.\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) defines a protected area as: \n\"A clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values.\"\nThis definition is intended to make it more difficult to claim MPA status for regions where exploitation of marine resources occurs. If there is no defined long-term goal for conservation and ecological recovery and extraction of marine resources occurs, a region is not a marine protected area.\n\n\"Marine protected area (MPA)\" is a term for protected areas that include marine environment and biodiversity.\n\nOther definitions by the IUCN include (2010):\n\"Any area of the intertidal or subtidal terrain, together with its overlying water and associated flora, fauna, historical and cultural features, which has been reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed environment.\"\n\nUnited States Executive Order 13158 in May 2000 established MPAs, defining them as;\n\"Any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by federal, state, tribal, territorial, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cultural resources therein.\"\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity defined the broader term of \"marine and coastal protected area\" (MCPA);\n\"Any defined area within or adjacent to the marine environment, together with its overlying water and associated flora, fauna, historical and cultural features, which has been reserved by legislation or other effective means, including custom, with the effect that its marine and/or coastal biodiversity enjoys a higher level of protection than its surroundings.\"\n\nAn apparently unique extension of the meaning is used by NOAA to refer to protected areas on the Great Lakes of North America.\n\nSeveral types of compliant MPA can be distinguished:\n\nIUCN offered seven categories of protected area, based on management objectives and four broad governance types.\n\nRelated protected area categories include the following;\n\n\nWhile \"area\" refers to a single contiguous location, terms such as \"network\", \"system\", and \"region\" that group MPAs are not always consistently employed.\"System\" is more often used to refer to an individual MPA, whereas \"region\" is defined by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre as:\n\"A collection of individual MPAs operating cooperatively, at various spatial scales and with a range of protection levels that are designed to meet objectives that a single reserve cannot achieve.\"\n\nAt the 2004 Convention on Biological Diversity, the agency agreed to use \"network\" on a global level, while adopting \"system\" for national and regional levels. The \"network\" is a mechanism to establish regional and local systems, but carries no authority or mandate, leaving all activity within the \"system\".\n\n\"No take zones\" (NTZs), are areas designated in a number of the world's MPAs, where all forms of exploitation are prohibited and severely limits human activities. These no take zones can cover an entire MPA, or specific portions. For example, the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, the world's largest MPA (and largest protected area of any type, land or sea), is a 100% no take zone.\n\nRelated terms include; \"specially protected area\" (SPA), \"Special Area of Conservation\" (SAC), the United Kingdom's \"marine conservation zones\" (MCZs), or \"area of special conservation\" (ASC) etc. which each provide specific restrictions.\n\nStressors that affect oceans include \"the impact of extractive industries, localised pollution, and changes to its chemistry (ocean acidification) resulting from elevated carbon dioxide levels, due to our emissions\". MPAs have been cited as the ocean's single greatest hope for increasing the resilience of the marine environment to such stressors. Well-designed and managed MPAs developed with input and support from interested stakeholders can conserve biodiversity and protect and restore fisheries.\n\nMPAs can help sustain local economies by supporting fisheries and tourism. For example, Apo Island in the Philippines made protected one quarter of their reef, allowing fish to recover, jumpstarting their economy. This was shown in the film, \"Resources at Risk: Philippine Coral Reef\". A 2016 report by the Center for Development and Strategy found that programs like the United States National Marine Sanctuary system can develop considerable economic benefits for communities through Public–private partnerships.\n\nTypical MPAs restrict fishing, oil and gas mining and/or tourism. Other restrictions may limit the use of ultrasonic devices like sonar (which may confuse the guidance system of cetaceans), development, construction and the like. Some fishing restrictions include \"no-take\" zones, which means that no fishing is allowed. Less than 1% of US MPAs are no-take.\n\nShip transit can also be restricted or banned, either as a preventive measure or to avoid direct disturbance to individual species. The degree to which environmental regulations affect shipping varies according to whether MPAs are located in territorial waters, exclusive economic zones, or the high seas. The law of the sea regulates these limits.\n\nMost MPAs have been located in territorial waters, where the appropriate government can enforce them. However, MPAs have been established in exclusive economic zones and in international waters. For example, Italy, France and Monaco in 1999 jointly established a cetacean sanctuary in the Ligurian Sea named the Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals. This sanctuary includes both national and international waters. Both the CBD and IUCN recommended a variety of management systems for use in a protected area system. They advocated that MPAs be seen as one of many \"nodes\" in a network of protected areas. The following are the most common management systems:\n\nSeasonal and temporary management—Activities, most critically fishing, are restricted seasonally or temporarily, e.g., to protect spawning/nursing grounds or to let a rapidly reducing species recover.\n\nMultiple-use MPAs—These are the most common and arguably the most effective. These areas employ two or more protections. The most important sections get the highest protection, such as a no take zone and are surrounded with areas of lesser protections.\n\nCommunity involvement and related approaches—Community-managed MPAs empower local communities to operate partially or completely independent of the governmental jurisdictions they occupy. Empowering communities to manage resources can lower conflict levels and enlist the support of diverse groups that rely on the resource such as subsistence and commercial fishers, scientists, recreation, tourism businesses, youths and others.\n\nMarine Protected Area Networks or MPA networks have been defined as \"A group of MPAs that interact with one another ecologically and/or socially form a network\".\n\nThese networks are intended to connect individuals and MPAs and promote education and cooperation among various administrations and user groups. \"MPA networks are, from the perspective of resource users, intended to address both environmental and socio-economic needs, complementary ecological and social goals and designs need greater research and policy support\".\n\nFilipino communities connect with one another to share information about MPAs, creating a larger network through the social communities' support. Emerging or established MPA networks can be found in Australia, Belize, the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Mexico.\n\nThe 17th International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) General Assembly in San Jose, California, the 19th IUCN assembly and the fourth World Parks Congress all proposed to centralise the establishment of protected areas. The World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 called for The Evian agreement, signed by G8 Nations in 2003, agreed to these terms. The Durban Action Plan, developed in 2003, called for regional action and targets to establish a network of protected areas by 2010 within the jurisdiction of regional environmental protocols.It recommended establishing protected areas for 20 to 30% of the world's oceans by the goal date of 2012. The Convention on Biological Diversity considered these recommendations and recommended requiring countries to set up marine parks controlled by a central organization before merging them. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed to the terms laid out by the convention, and in 2004, its member nations committed to the following targets;\n\n\"The establishment by 2010 of terrestrial and by 2012 for marine areas of comprehensive, effectively managed, and ecologically representative national and regional systems of protected areas that collectively, inter alia through a global network, contribute to achieving the three objectives of the Convention and the 2010 target to significantly reduce the current late of biodiversity loss at the global, regional, national, and sub-national levels and contribute to poverty reduction and the pursuit of sustainable development.\"\n\nThe UN later endorsed another decision, Decision VII/15, in 2006:\n\nThe 10% conservation goal is also found in Sustainable Development Goal 14 (which is part of the Convention on Biological Diversity) and which sets this 10% goal to a later date (2020). In 2017, the UN held the United Nations Ocean Conference aiming to find ways and urge for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14. I that 2017 conference, it was clear that just between 3,6 and 5,7% of the world's oceans were protected, meaning another 6,4 to 4,3% of the world's oceans needed to be protected within 3 years. \nThe 10% protection goal is described as a \"baby step\" as 30% is the real amount of ocean protection scientists agree on that should be implemented.\n\nOn 7 April 1982, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CAMLR Convention) came into force after discussions began in 1975 between parties of the then-current Antarctic Treaty to limit large-scale exploitation of krill by commercial fisheries. The Convention bound contracting nations to abide by previously agreed upon Antarctic territorial claims and peaceful use of the region while protecting ecosystem integrity south of the Antarctic Convergence and 60 S latitude. In so doing, it also established a commission of the original signatories and acceding parties called the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to advance these aims through protection, scientific study, and rational use, such as harvesting, of those marine resources. Though separate, the Antarctic Treaty and CCAMLR, make up part the broader system of international agreements called the Antarctic Treaty System. Since 1982, the CCAMLR meets annually to implement binding conservations measures like the creation of 'protected areas' at the suggestion of the convention's scientific committee.\n\nIn 2009, the CCAMLR created the first 'high-seas' MPA entirely within international waters over the southern shelf of the South Orkney Islands. This area encompasses and all fishing activity including transhipment, and dumping or discharge of waste is prohibited with the exception of scientific research endeavors. On 28 October 2016, the CCAMLR, composed of 24 member countries and the European Union at the time, agreed to establish the world's largest marine park encompassing 1.55 million km (600,000 sq mi) in the Ross Sea after several years of failed negotiations. Establishment of the Ross Sea MPA required unanimity of the commission members and enforcement will begin in December 2017. However, due to a sunset provision inserted into the proposal, the new marine park will only be in force for 35 years.\n\nPacific Islands Marine Protected Areas Community\nNorth American Marine Protected Areas Network\nConvention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources\n\nMany countries have established national targets, accompanied by action plans and implementations. The UN Council identified the need for countries to collaborate with each other to establish effective regional conservation plans. Some national targets are listed in the table below\n\nThe prevalent practice of area-based targets was criticized in 2019 by a group of environmental scientists because politicians tended to protect parts of the oceans where little fishing happened to meet the goals. The lack of fishing in these areas made them easy to protect, but it also had little positive impact.\n\nThe marine protected area network is still in its infancy. As of October 2010, approximately 6,800 MPAs had been established, covering 1.17% of global ocean area. Protected areas covered 2.86% of exclusive economic zones (EEZs). MPAs covered 6.3% of territorial seas. Many prohibit the use of harmful fishing techniques yet only 0.01% of the ocean's area is designated as a \"no take zone\". This coverage is far below the projected goal of 20%-30% Those targets have been questioned mainly due to the cost of managing protected areas and the conflict that protections have generated with human demand for marine goods and services.\n\nA marine protected area of South Africa is an area of coastline or ocean within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Republic of South Africa that is protected in terms of specific legislation.\n\nThere are a total of 45 marine protected areas in the South African EEZ, with a total area of 5% of the waters. The target is to have 10% of the oceanic waters protected by 2020. All but one of the MPAs are in the coastal waters off continental South Africa, and one is off Prince Edward Island in the Southern Ocean.\n\nThe Greater Caribbean subdivision encompasses an area of about of ocean and 38 nations. The area includes island countries like the Bahamas and Cuba, and the majority of Central America. The Convention for Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (better known as the Cartagena Convention) was established in 1983. Protocols involving protected areas were ratified in 1990. As of 2008, the region hosted about 500 MPAs. Coral reefs are the best represented.\n\nTwo networks are under development, the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (a long barrier reef that borders the coast of much of Central America), and the \"Islands in the Stream\" program (covering the Gulf of Mexico).\n\nSoutheast Asia is a global epicenter for marine diversity. 12% of its coral reefs are in MPAs. The Philippines have some the world's best coral reefs and protect them to attract international tourism. Most of the Philippines' MPAs are established to secure protection for its coral reef and sea grass habitats. Indonesia has MPAs designed for tourism and relies on tourism as a main source of income.\n\nThe Philippines host one of the most highly biodiverse regions, with 464 reef-building coral species. Due to overfishing, destructive fishing techniques, and rapid coastal development, these are in rapid decline. The country has established some 600 MPAs. However, the majority are poorly enforced and are highly ineffective. However, some have positively impacted reef health, increased fish biomass, decreased coral bleaching and increased yields in adjacent fisheries. One notable example is the MPA surrounding Apo Island.\n\nLatin America has designated one large MPA system. As of 2008, 0.5% of its marine environment was protected, mostly through the use of small, multiple-use MPAs.\n\nThe South Pacific network ranges from Belize to Chile. Governments in the region adopted the Lima convention and action plan in 1981. An MPA-specific protocol was ratified in 1989. The permanent commission on the exploitation and conservation on the marine resources of the South Pacific promotes the exchange of studies and information among participants.\n\nThe region is currently running one comprehensive cross-national program, the Tropical Eastern Pacific Marine Corridor Network, signed in April 2004. The network covers about .\n\nOne alternative to imposing MPAs on an indigenous population is through the use of Indigenous Protected Areas, such as those in Australia.\n\nThe North Pacific network covers the western coasts of Mexico, Canada, and the U.S. The \"Antigua Convention\" and an action plan for the north Pacific region were adapted in 2002. Participant nations manage their own national systems. In 2010–2011, the State of California completed hearings and actions via the state Department of Fish and Game to establish new MPAs.\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed a proclamation on September 25, 2014, designating the world's largest marine reserve. The proclamation expanded the existing Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, one of the world's most pristine tropical marine environments, to six times its current size, encompassing of protected area around these islands. Expanding the Monument protected the area's unique deep coral reefs and seamounts.\nIn April 2009, the US established a United States National System of Marine Protected Areas, which strengthens the protection of US ocean, coastal and Great Lakes resources. These large-scale MPAs should balance \"the interests of conservationists, fishers, and the public.\" As of 2009, 225 MPAs participated in the national system. Sites work together toward common national and regional conservation goals and priorities. NOAA's national marine protected areas center maintains a comprehensive inventory of all 1,600+ MPAs within the US exclusive economic zone. Most US MPAs.allow some type of extractive use. Fewer than 1% of U.S. waters prohibit all extractive activities.\n\nIn 1981 Olympic National Park became a marine protected area. The total protected site area is . 173.2 km of the area was an MPA. The national system is a mechanism to foster MPA collaboration. Sites that meet pertinent criteria are eligible to join the national system. Four entry criteria govern admission:\nIn 1999, California adopted the Marine Life Protection Act, establishing the first state law requiring a comprehensive, science-based MPA network. The state created the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative. The MLPA Blue Ribbon Task Force and stakeholder and scientific advisory groups ensure that the process uses the science and public participation.\n\nThe MLPA Initiative established a plan to create California's statewide MPA network by 2011 in several steps. The Central Coast step was successfully completed in September, 2007. The North Central Coast step was completed in 2010. The South Coast and North Coast steps were expected to go into effect in 2012.\n\nIn exchange for some of its national debt being written off, the Seychelles designates two new marine protected areas in the Indian Ocean, covering about . It is the result of a financial deal, brokered in 2016 by The Nature Conservancy.\n\nThere are a number of marine protected areas around the coastline of the United Kingdom, known as Marine Conservation Zones in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and Marine Protected Areas in Scotland. They are to be found in inshore and offshore waters.\n\nThe United Kingdom is also creating marine protected reserves around several British Overseas Territories.\nThe UK is responsible for 6.8 million square kilometres of ocean around the world, larger than all but four other countries.\n\nThe Chagos Marine Protected Area in the Indian Ocean was established in 2010 as a \"no-take-zone\". With a total surface area of , it was the world's largest contiguous marine reserve. In March 2015, the UK announced the creation of a marine reserve around the Pitcairn Islands in the Southern Pacific Ocean to protect its special biodiversity. The area of surpassed the Chagos Marine Protected Area as the world's largest contiguous marine reserve, until the August 2016 expansion of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument in the United States to .\n\nIn January 2016, the UK government announced the intention to create a marine protected area around Ascension Island. The protected area will be , half of which will be closed to fishing.\n\nThe Natura 2000 ecological MPA network in the European Union included MPAs in the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea. The member states had to define NATURA 2000 areas at sea in their Exclusive Economic Zone.\n\nTwo assessments, conducted thirty years apart, of three Mediterranean MPAs, demonstrate that proper protection allows commercially valuable and slow-growing red coral (Corallium rubrum) to produce large colonies in shallow water of less than . Shallow-water colonies outside these decades-old MPAs are typically very small. The MPAs are Banyuls, Carry-le-Rouet and Scandola, off the island of Corsica.\n\n\n\nA 2018 study published in Science found that trawling is more intense inside official EU marine sanctuaries and that endangered fish species such as sharks and rays are more common outside them.\n\n\nThe following shows a list of countries and their marine protected areas as percentage of their territorial waters (click \"show\" to expand).\n\nManagers and scientists use geographic information systems and remote sensing to map and analyze MPAs. NOAA Coastal Services Center compiled an \"Inventory of GIS-Based Decision-Support Tools for MPAs.\" The report focuses on GIS tools with the highest utility for MPA processes. Remote sensing uses advances in aerial photography image capture, pop-up archival satellite tags, satellite imagery, acoustic data, and radar imagery. Mathematical models that seek to reflect the complexity of the natural setting may assist in planning harvesting strategies and sustaining fishing grounds.\n\nCoral reef systems have been in decline worldwide. Causes include overfishing, pollution and ocean acidification. As of 2013 30% of the world's reefs were severely damaged. Approximately 60% will be lost by 2030 without enhanced protection. Marine reserves with \"no take zones\" are the most effective form of protection. Only about 0.01% of the world's coral reefs are inside effective MPAs.\n\nMPAs can be an effective tool to maintain fish populations; see refuge (ecology). The general concept is to create overpopulation within the MPA. The fish expand into the surrounding areas to reduce crowding, increasing the population of unprotected areas. This helps support local fisheries in the surrounding area, while maintaining a healthy population within the MPA. Such MPAs are most commonly used for coral reef ecosystems.\n\nOne example is at Goat Island Bay in New Zealand, established in 1977. Research gathered at Goat Bay documented the spillover effect. \"Spillover and larval export—the drifting of millions of eggs and larvae beyond the reserve—have become central concepts of marine conservation\". This positively impacted commercial fishermen in surrounding areas.\n\nAnother unexpected result of MPAs is their impact on predatory marine species, which in some conditions can increase in population. When this occurs, prey populations decrease. One study showed that in 21 out of 39 cases, \"trophic cascades,\" caused a decrease in herbivores, which led to an increase in the quantity of plant life. (This occurred in the Malindi Kisite and Watamu Marian National Parks in Kenya; the Leigh Marine Reserve in New Zealand; and Brackett's Landing Conservation Area in the US.\n\nBoth CBD and IUCN have criteria for setting up and maintaining MPA networks, which emphasize 4 factors:\n\nMisconceptions about MPAs include the belief that all MPAs are no-take or no-fishing areas. However, less than 1 percent of US waters are no-take areas. MPA activities can include consumption fishing, diving and other activities.\n\nAnother misconception is that most MPAs are federally managed. Instead, MPAs are managed under hundreds of laws and jurisdictions. They can exist in state, commonwealth, territory and tribal waters.\n\nAnother misconception is that a federal mandate dedicates a set percentage of ocean to MPAs. Instead the mandate requires an evaluation of current MPAs and creates a public resource on current MPAs.\n\nSome existing and proposed MPAs have been criticized by indigenous populations and their supporters, as impinging on land usage rights. For example, the proposed Chagos Protected Area in the Chagos Islands is contested by Chagossians deported from their homeland in 1965 by the British as part of the creation of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). According to WikiLeaks CableGate documents, the UK proposed that the BIOT become a \"marine reserve\" with the aim of preventing the former inhabitants from returning to their lands and to protect the joint UK/US military base on Diego Garcia Island.\n\nOther critiques include: their cost (higher than that of passive management), conflicts with human development goals, inadequate scope to address factors such as climate change and invasive species.\n\nIn Scotland, environmental groups have criticised the government for failing to enforce fishing rules around MPAs.\n\nIn 2010, one study found that fish larvae can drift on ocean currents and reseed fish stocks at a distant location. This finding demonstrated that fish populations can be connected to distant locations through the process of larval drift.\n\nThey investigated the yellow tang, because larva of this species stay in the general area of the reef in which they first settle. The tropical yellow tang is heavily fished by the aquarium trade. By the late 1990s, their stocks were collapsing. Nine MPAs were established off the coast of Hawaii to protect them. Larval drift has helped them establish themselves in different locations, and the fishery is recovering. \"We've clearly shown that fish larvae that were spawned inside marine reserves can drift with currents and replenish fished areas long distances away,\" said coauthor Mark Hixon.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1910996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910996", "title": "Implant (medicine)", "text": "Implant (medicine)\n\nAn implant is a medical device manufactured to replace a missing biological structure, support a damaged biological structure, or enhance an existing biological structure. Medical implants are man-made devices, in contrast to a transplant, which is a transplanted biomedical tissue. The surface of implants that contact the body might be made of a biomedical material such as titanium, silicone, or apatite depending on what is the most functional. In some cases implants contain electronics e.g. artificial pacemaker and cochlear implants. Some implants are bioactive, such as subcutaneous drug delivery devices in the form of implantable pills or drug-eluting stents.\n\nImplants can roughly be categorized into groups by application:\n\nSensory and neurological implants are used for disorders affecting the major senses and the brain, as well as other neurological disorders. They are predominately used in the treatment of conditions such as cataract, glaucoma, keratoconus, and other visual impairments; otosclerosis and other hearing loss issues, as well as middle ear diseases such as otitis media; and neurological diseases such as epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and treatment-resistant depression. Examples include the intraocular lens, intrastromal corneal ring segment, cochlear implant, tympanostomy tube, and neurostimulator.\n\nCardiovascular medical devices are implanted in cases where the heart, its valves, and the rest of the circulatory system is in disorder. They are used to treat conditions such as heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, ventricular tachycardia, valvular heart disease, angina pectoris, and atherosclerosis. Examples include the artificial heart, artificial heart valve, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, cardiac pacemaker, and coronary stent.\n\nOrthopaedic implants help alleviate issues with the bones and joints of the body. They're used to treat bone fractures, osteoarthritis, scoliosis, spinal stenosis, and chronic pain. Examples include a wide variety of pins, rods, screws, and plates used to anchor fractured bones while they heal.\n\nMetallic glasses based on magnesium with zinc and calcium addition are tested as the potential metallic biomaterials for biodegradable medical implants.\n\nPatient with orthopaedic implants sometimes need to be put under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine for detailed musculoskeletal study. Therefore, concerns have been raised regarding the loosening and migration of implant, heating of the implant metal which could cause thermal damage to surrounding tissues, and distortion of the MRI scan that affects the imaging results. A study of orthopaedic implants in 2005 has shown that majority of the orthopaedic implants does not react with magnetic fields under the 1.0 Tesla MRI scanning machine with the exception of external fixator clamps. However, at 7.0 Tesla, several orthopaedic implants would show significant interaction with the MRI magnetic fields, such as heel and fibular implant.\n\nElectrical implants are being used to relieve pain and suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. The electric implant is embedded in the neck of patients with rheumatoid arthritics, the implant sends electrical signals to electrodes in the vagus nerve. The application of this device is being tested an alternative to medicating sufferers of rheumatoid arthritis for their lifetime.\n\nContraceptive implants are primarily used to prevent unintended pregnancy and treat conditions such as non-pathological forms of menorrhagia. Examples include copper- and hormone-based intrauterine devices.\n\nCosmetic implants — often prosthetics — attempt to bring some portion of the body back to an acceptable aesthetic norm. They are used as a follow-up to mastectomy due to breast cancer, for correcting some forms of disfigurement, and modifying aspects of the body (as in buttock augmentation and chin augmentation). Examples include the breast implant, nose prosthesis, ocular prosthesis, and injectable filler.\n\nOther types of organ dysfunction can occur in the systems of the body, including the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urological systems. Implants are used in those and other locations to treat conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastroparesis, respiratory failure, sleep apnea, urinary and fecal incontinence, and erectile dysfunction. Examples include the LINX, implantable gastric stimulator, diaphragmatic/phrenic nerve stimulator, neurostimulator, surgical mesh, artificial urinary sphincter and penile implant.\n\nMedical devices are classified by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under three different classes depending on the risks the medical device may impose on the user. According to 21CFR 860.3, Class I devices are considered to pose the least amount of risk to the user and require the least amount of control. Class I devices include simple devices such as arm slings and hand-held surgical instruments. Class II devices are considered to need more regulation than Class I devices and are required to undergo specific requirements before FDA approval. Class II devices include X-ray systems and physiological monitors. Class III devices require the most regulatory controls since the device supports or sustains human life or may not be well tested. Class III devices include replacement heart valves and implanted cerebellar stimulators. Many implants typically fall under Class II and Class III devices.\n\nA variety of minimally bioreactive metals are implanted. The most commonly implanted form of stainless steel is 316L, and for long-term implants, cobalt-chromium and titanium-based implant alloys are also used. All of these are made passive by a thin layer of oxide on their surface. Stainless steel remains subject to corrosion, and is therefore only used for temporary implants, while \nthe titanium and cobalt-chrome alloys can be implanted indefinitely. A consideration, however, is that metal ions do diffuse outward through the oxide, and end up in the surrounding tissue. Bioreaction to metal implants includes the formation of a small envelope of fibrous tissue. The thickness of this layer is determined by the products being dissolved, and the extent to which the implant moves around within the enclosing tissue. Pure titanium, a preferred implant material, may have only a minimal fibrous encapsulation. Stainless steel, on the other hand, may elicit encapsulation of as much as 2 mm.\n\nUnder ideal conditions, implants should initiate the desired host response. Ideally, the implant should not cause any undesired reaction from neighboring or distant tissues. However, the interaction between the implant and the tissue surrounding the implant can lead to complications. The process of implantation of medical devices is subjected to the same complications that other invasive medical procedures can have during or after surgery. Common complications include infection, inflammation, and pain. Other complications that can occur include risk of rejection from implant-induced coagulation and allergic foreign body response. Depending on the type of implant, the complications may vary.\n\nWhen the site of an implant becomes infected during or after surgery, the surrounding tissue becomes infected by microorganisms. Three main categories of infection can occur after operation. Superficial immediate infections are caused by organisms that commonly grow near or on skin. The infection usually occurs at the surgical opening. Deep immediate infection, the second type, occurs immediately after surgery at the site of the implant. Skin-dwelling and airborne bacteria cause deep immediate infection. These bacteria enter the body by attaching to the implant's surface prior to implantation. Though not common, deep immediate infections can also occur from dormant bacteria from previous infections of the tissue at the implantation site that have been activated from being disturbed during the surgery. The last type, late infection, occurs months to years after the implantation of the implant. Late infections are caused by dormant blood-borne bacteria attached to the implant prior to implantation. The blood-borne bacteria colonize on the implant and eventually get released from it. Depending on the type of material used to make the implant, it may be infused with antibiotics to lower the risk of infections during surgery. However, only certain types of materials can be infused with antibiotics, the use of antibiotic-infused implants runs the risk of rejection by the patient since the patient may develop a sensitivity to the antibiotic, and the antibiotic may not work on the bacteria.\n\nInflammation, a common occurrence after any surgical procedure, is the body's response to tissue damage as a result of trauma, infection, intrusion of foreign materials, or local cell death, or as a part of an immune response. Inflammation starts with the rapid dilation of local capillaries to supply the local tissue with blood. The inflow of blood causes the tissue to become swollen and may cause cell death. The excess blood, or edema, can activate pain receptors at the tissue. The site of the inflammation becomes warm from local disturbances of fluid flow and the increased cellular activity to repair the tissue or remove debris from the site.\n\nImplant-induced coagulation is similar to the coagulation process done within the body to prevent blood loss from damaged blood vessels. However, the coagulation process is triggered from proteins that become attached to the implant surface and lose their shapes. When this occurs, the protein changes conformation and different activation sites become exposed, which may trigger an immune system response where the body attempts to attack the implant to remove the foreign material. The trigger of the immune system response can be accompanied by inflammation. The immune system response may lead to chronic inflammation where the implant is rejected and has to be removed from the body. The immune system may encapsulate the implant as an attempt to remove the foreign material from the site of the tissue by encapsulating the implant in fibrinogen and platelets. The encapsulation of the implant can lead to further complications, since the thick layers of fibrous encapsulation may prevent the implant from performing the desired functions. Bacteria may attack the fibrous encapsulation and become embedded into the fibers. Since the layers of fibers are thick, antibiotics may not be able to reach the bacteria and the bacteria may grow and infect the surrounding tissue. In order to remove the bacteria, the implant would have to be removed. Lastly, the immune system may accept the presence of the implant and repair and remodel the surrounding tissue. Similar responses occur when the body initiates an allergic foreign body response. In the case of an allergic foreign body response, the implant would have to be removed.\n\nThe many examples of implant failure include rupture of silicone breast implants, hip replacement joints, and artificial heart valves, such as the Bjork–Shiley valve, all of which have caused FDA intervention. The consequences of implant failure depend on the nature of the implant and its position in the body. Thus, heart valve failure is likely to threaten the life of the individual, while breast implant or hip joint failure is less likely to be life-threatening.\n\nDevices implanted directly in the grey matter of the brain produce the highest quality signals, but are prone to scar-tissue build-up, causing the signal to become weaker, or even non-existent, as the body reacts to a foreign object in the brain.\n\nIn 2018, \"Implant files\", an investigation made by ICIJ revealed that medical devices that are unsafe and have not been adequately tested were implanted in patients' bodies. In United Kingdom, Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, concludes: \"All implantable devices should be registered and tracked to monitor efficacy and patient safety in the long-term.\"\n\n\n"}

The animals are less than ½ mm wide, with sac-like bodies, and three distinctly different forms in different parts of their three-stage life cycle.\n\nThey are so unlike any known animal that its discovery by Danish scientists in 1995 led to the creation of a new phylum. The phylum Cycliophora, from the Greek for 'carrying a small wheel', was named after the creature's circular mouth. Two other members of that phylum have since been discovered.\n\n\"Symbion\" refers to the animal's symbiotic relationship with its lobster host while the specific epithet \"pandora\" refers to the part of the organism's life cycle that reminded Funch and Christensen of the mythical Pandora's box.\n\n\"Symbion pandora\" has a bilateral, sac-like body with no coelom. There are three basic life stages:\n\n\n\"Symbion pandora\" can reproduce both asexually by budding and sexually. The sexual reproductive cycle is triggered when the host crustacean molts its skin in order to grow: a feeding stage buds a male, which attaches to another feeding stage and triggers it to bud a female, which it impregnates. The female is able to swim, and finds another host crustacean, where the larva in her develops. The female dies, and the larva escapes, spawning another feeding stage on the new host.\n\n"}

He served in the United States Army during World War I, and worked as a salesman, a farmer, and then as secretary to Congressman Lindsay Warren from 1924 to 1940.\n\nUpon Warren's resignation from Congress in 1940, Bonner was elected simultaneously to complete the unexpired term, and was elected to the 77th Congress for a full term. He served for twelve full terms, from November 5, 1940 until his death from cancer in Washington, D.C. on November 7, 1965.

The revenue recognition principle is the basis of making adjusting entries that pertain to unearned and accrued revenues under accrual-basis accounting. They are sometimes called Balance Day adjustments because they are made on balance day.\n\nBased on the matching principle of accrual accounting, revenues and associated costs are recognized in the same accounting period. However the actual cash may be received or paid at a different time.\n\nMost adjusting entries could be classified this way:\n\nAdjusting entries for prepayments are necessary to account for cash that has been received prior to delivery of goods or completion of services. When this cash is paid, it is first recorded in a prepaid expense asset account; the account is to be expensed either with the passage of time (e.g. rent, insurance) or through use and consumption (e.g. supplies).\n\nA company receiving the cash for benefits yet to be delivered will have to record the amount in an unearned revenue liability account. Then, an adjusting entry to recognize the revenue is used as necessary.\n\nAssume a magazine publishing company charges an annual subscription fee of $12. The cash is paid up-front at the start of the subscription. The income, based on sales basis method, is recognized upon delivery. Therefore, the initial reporting of the receipt of annual subscription fee is indicated as:\n\nThe adjusting entry reporting each month after the delivery is:\n\nThe unearned revenue after the first month is therefore $11 and revenue reported in the income statement is $1.\n\nAccrued revenues are revenues that have been recognized (that is, services have been performed or goods have been delivered), but their cash payment have not yet been recorded or received. When the revenue is recognized, it is recorded as a receivable.\n\nAccrued expenses have not yet been paid for, so they are recorded in a payable account. Expenses for interest, taxes, rent, and salaries are commonly accrued for reporting purposes.\n\nAn income which has been earned but it has not been received yet during the accounting period. Incomes like rent, interest on investments, commission etc. are examples of accrued income.\n\nA third classification of adjusting entry occurs where the exact amount of an expense cannot easily be determined. The depreciation of fixed assets, for example, is an expense which has to be estimated.\n\nThe entry for bad debt expense can also be classified as an estimate.\n\nIn a periodic inventory system, an adjusting entry is used to determine the cost of goods sold expense. This entry is not necessary for a company using perpetual inventory.\n\n\nFurther reading:\n"}

Zuiker. Starring American recording artist Britney Spears and her then-husband Kevin Federline, the five-episode series aired on UPN from May 17 to June 14, 2005. The series chronicles the couple's relationship from their courtship, engagement and wedding.\n\nA majority of the footage was originally shot for Spears' own reality series to document the European leg of The Onyx Hotel Tour in the spring of 2004. Spears fell and injured her left knee during the shooting of the music video for \"Outrageous\", causing the remainder of the tour and the series to be cancelled.\n\n\"Britney and Kevin: Chaotic\" was heavily criticized by critics, who considered the series to be career suicide for Spears. Critics noted Spears' excessive narcissism and criticized the themes of the series as being too explicit. The DVD release of \"Britney and Kevin: Chaotic\" included Spears' first extended play of .\n\nMTV News announced in April 2004 that Spears was planning a reality television series to document her backstage life during the European leg of The Onyx Hotel Tour. Pitched as \"OnTourage\", footage from the six-week leg was to be compiled into a six-episode series, with each episode selling for about $1 million, \"much more than most reality programs\". Spears was to narrate and shoot footage of her with her dancers and handlers. The show was planned to be completed \"as early as summer\".\n\nOn June 8, Spears was shooting the music video for \"Outrageous\" in Queens, when she fell and injured her left knee. She was taken immediately to a local hospital and underwent arthroscopic surgery the next day. She was forced to remain six weeks with a knee brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused any future concerts to be canceled. As a result, \"OnTourage\" was also scrapped.\n\nIn July, Spears announced her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline, whom she had met three months before. As Federline had only recently ended his relationship with actress Shar Jackson, who was pregnant with their second child, this engagement was the subject of extensive media coverage. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement. In October 2004, the singer announced she would be taking another career break to start a family.\n\nAfter a \"fierce bidding war\", on April 5, 2005, it was announced that Spears had signed a deal with UPN to air a reality television series documenting her relationship with Federline. The series, which would air in five episodes, was revealed to chronicle the relationship \"from the earliest stages of their courtship to their engagement and ultimately, their stroll down the aisle\". In a statement about the series, Spears stated: \"From the day that Kevin and I met, there have been constant rumors and inaccurate speculation about our lives together. I feel that last year, the tabloids ran my life, and I am really excited about showing my fans what really happened, rather than all the stories, which have been misconstrued by journalists in the past. As I mentioned before, I am now going to be expressing my personal life through art\".\n\nThe series was initially titled \"Britney and Kevin: Can You Handle Our Truth?\", before its title was changed to \"Britney and Kevin: Chaotic\", with \"Can you handle our truth?\" becoming its tagline. All of the footage shot for \"OnTourage\" was used for \"Britney and Kevin: Chaotic\". According to Spears, the series helped the couple to know each other more, saying: \"I didn't know [Kevin] that well, and when I got the camera out, it made me feel better. It's really weird because it was like all this tension at first. We were so nervous being together. I'm really shy, and when I had the camera in my hand, it made me feel more outspoken.\"\n\n\"Britney and Kevin: Chaotic\" was heavily criticized by critics. Taylor Carik of \"Flak Magazine\" considered the series an \"insult to common sense and decency\", while commenting that \"Britney's ridiculous behavior in \"Chaotic\" confirms the obvious transparency of her status as a 'celebrity product' and the calculated nature of her success\". He also noted that music critics would \"easily open the floodgates for new and creative ways to discuss her offense to pop culture's attempts at meaningfulness\". Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk reviewed the series as an \"absolute disaster of the highest order\", while writing that: \"[\"Britney & Kevin: Chaotic\"] is an absolutely watchable and horrifying train wreck of a series\". Slant Magazine writer Ed Gonzalez noted that \"the show's extreme shooting style makes it especially hard to stare at what is—no more no less—a totem to the pop singer's narcissism\". He stated that the views Spears expresses in the series suggest that she is \"someone who believes they're the only person on the face of the earth\". \n\nJosh Wolk of \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt that \"Britney and Kevin: Chaotic\" was Spears' \"career suicide by videocam\", commenting, \"the truth is not only that she's vapid, but that she's self-obsessed to a dangerous degree\". Wolk also noted \"many intersecting things wrong on this show and with Britney that I can't possibly prioritize them\". Laura Fries of \"Variety\" perceived the series as \"a visual assault of nauseating camera angles, likely to upset even the most desensitized TV viewer\". Hayley Butler of Jam! gave the final episode of the series a mixed review, saying it \"was full of tear-jerking moments\" and \"the only episode not full of stupid jokes, childish behaviour and Britney's thoughts on life\", commenting that Spears and Federline wedding scenes \"looked to be a very emotional and touching event\". Butler also wondered \"if they feel their show served its purpose\".\n\nDuring a 2013 interview, Spears described the series as \"the worst thing I’ve done in my career\", and said: \"I would never do something like that again.\"\n\nThe first episode of the series was seen by 3.7 million viewers, making it UPN's most-watched piece of regularly scheduled programming in the 9pm Tuesday timeslot since March 2004. The second episode garnered 3 million viewers, finishing in eighty-first in its timeslot for the week. The third and fourth episode were viewed by 2.5 million viewers each, while the final, aired an hour earlier at 8:00pm Eastern Standard Time, drew 2.1 million viewers. In one month, \"Britney and Kevin: Chaotic\" lost 1.6 million viewers.\n\n<onlyinclude>\n</onlyinclude>\n\nBritney & Kevin: Chaotic... the DVD & More was released on September 27, 2005 in the United States.

It was written and produced by Carey along with Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, and Johntá Austin. The song was initially solicited to radio on July 12, 2005, by Island and Mercury Records as the album's third single in the United States, while \"Get Your Number\" served as the album's third single elsewhere. Described by Dupri as \"ghetto,\" the track is a R&B song that makes use of pop and hip hop influences and a simple, sparse production. Lyrically, the song follows Carey as she moves on from her relationship with an unfaithful lover, packing her things and breaking up with him over an answering machine.\n\nThe song was well received by music critics, with many complimenting its simple yet inspirational lyrics, as well as calling it a standout track from the album. It peaked at number two on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, blocked by Carey's own \"We Belong Together\" and Kanye West's \"Gold Digger\" for six weeks. Furthermore, it marked the first time a female lead artist occupied the top two positions of the Hot 100. The song also peaked at numbers six and five in Australia and New Zealand, and numbers fifteen and nine in Ireland and the United Kingdom, respectively.\n\nThe song's music video, directed by Jake Nava features numerous extravagant wardrobe changes and starred actor Chris Tucker. The video was nominated for Best R&B Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. \"Shake It Off\" was performed live by Carey on several televised events, including the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, the 2005 World Music Awards and British program \"Top of the Pops\". Additionally it was performed as a five-piece concert on \"Good Morning America\", and on the New Year's Eve special titled, Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest. \"Shake It Off\" was included on the set-lists of The Adventures of Mimi Tour (2006), the Angels Advocate Tour (2010), The Elusive Chanteuse Show (2014), The Sweet Sweet Fantasy Tour (2016), the All The Hits Tour with Lionel Richie (2017) and her second concert residency, The Butterfly Returns (2018).\n\nCarey had produced back-to-back commercially and critically failing albums, \"Glitter\" (2001) and \"Charmbracelet\" (2002). After the release of \"Charmbracelet\", and its succeeding tour, Carey began working on \"The Emancipation of Mimi\", her tenth studio effort. By November 2004, Carey had already recorded several songs for the album. Island Records head L.A. Reid suggested Carey to compose a few more strong singles to ensure the project's commercial success. Noting that she had written some of her best work with Jermaine Dupri, Reid recommended that Carey meet with Dupri for a brief studio session. Carey took Reid's advice and headed to Atlanta to collaborate with Dupri. During this two-day trip, the duo wrote and produced \"Shake It Off\" and \"Get Your Number,\" which were eventually released as the album's third and fourth singles. Following this recording session, \"Shake It Off\" was briefly selected as the album's lead single, replacing the two other contenders \"Stay The Night\" and \"Say Somethin'\". Dupri explained to MTV News:\n\nI had that beat actually before she got to the studio. So she came in, she heard that beat and was like, 'Yeah, that's what I want.' That was one of the first records we had. I didn't really know what to do for her because I didn't hear nothing else that was on the album, but I just felt like she didn't have that bounce on her album.\n\n\"Shake It Off\" is a mid-tempo R&B and pop song with a hip hop backbeat and a \"thumping\", sparse production. Written and produced by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox and Johntá Austin, the song drew comparisons to several productions from Usher's 2004 album, \"Confessions\". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by W.B.M. Music Corporation, \"Shake It Off\" is set in common time with a tempo of 66 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D major with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of D to the high-note of G#. The song follows in the chord progression of Bm–Am–Gmaj The verses and chorus remain in a narrow voice range, until according to Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\", Carey \"gives herself a few of her old sky-high notes as a background flourish\" near the song's end. According to Carey's album guide in \"Rolling Stone\", Dupri leaves his trademark on the album's best tracks including \"Shake It Off\", with the track's production and beat described as \"syncopated\" and \"bouncy.\"\n\nLyrically, the song features a message of female strength, the song lyrics were described as \"goofy\" and \"fun\" by Larry Katz from the \"Boston Herald\". Reading \"Just like the Calgon commercial / I really gotta get up out of here\", Carey tells her lover that she is leaving him, making a \"clever\" reference to a commercial. In regards to the latter lyrics, Lawrence Farber from the \"Windy City Times\" wrote \"they are a playful approach to bitterness—and, more specifically, a cheatin' bad apple.\" She then sings \"By the time you get this message / It's gonna be too late / So don't bother paging me / 'Cause I'll be on my way,\" establishing that the relationship is over, and that he shouldn't even try to mend the situation. She also makes reference to his infidelity, \"with this one and that one / By the pool, on the beach, in the streets.\" In an interview with MTV News, Dupri described the song's composition:\n\n\"'Shake It Off' was just like ... That comes from that style of I guess [Usher's] Confessions and just that bounce. It's got a lot of ingredients to it because I never thought that Mariah could make a bouncy type of record. When you hear that song — the whole bounce of the record and the way she's flipping it and the stuff she talking about ... I knew that record was gonna go just because you never heard Mariah talk about this stuff. ... She's like, 'I packed up my Louis Vuitton.' She took it really on the ghetto side. I knew that was gonna strike people. Either it was gonna hit them in a wrong way or they was gonna love it.\n\"Shake It Off\" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine picked \"Shake It Off\" as a top pick from the album. Michael Paoletta, writing for \"Billboard\", gave the song a positive review, complimenting its lyrics, production and Carey's vocals. He concluded his review with his assurance that the song would be a success, writing \"After 'We Belong Together' brought her back to radio big time, 'Shake It Off' will take Carey's good fortune to the next step.\" Some critics compared the song heavily to Usher's material from his 2004 album, \"Confessions\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote \"Mariah too heavily bites on the styles of her successors: Usher by way of Dupri on 'Shake It Off',\" while Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said the song was \"Usher-lite\". Lawrence Ferber from the \"Windy City Times\" described \"Shake It Off\" as a \"standout\" track from the album. When discussing the track with Ferber, Carey described the song as her favorite from \"The Emancipation of Mimi\": \"Shake it off can apply to anything. Whatever personal dramas we go through, put that song on and you lose the anxiety or intensity of the moment. I'll listen to that song when I've just come out of an annoying meeting. I gotta shake this off.\" While Todd Burns from \"Stylus Magazine\" described it as \"sultry\", a writer from the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" called it \"lyrically crude\" and \"ghetto\". Similarly, \"The Michigan Daily\"s Chris Gaerig criticized Carey's \"airy vocals\" and wrote \"Carey sounds like a 13-year-old boy going through puberty, singing love songs to a grade school crush.\"\n\nIn the United States, \"Shake It Off\" entered the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 66 the week's highest debut. In its seventh week on the chart, it reached number two behind Carey's previous single, \"We Belong Together,\" marking the second time a female lead artist occupied the top two positions of the Hot 100. \"Shake It Off\" was at the number two position for an additional five weeks after \"We Belong Together\" fell from number one (six weeks in total); it was subsequently held off the top spot by Kanye West's \"Gold Digger\". The song stayed within the Hot 100 for 26 weeks, and finished at number fifteen on the \"Billboard\" Year-End Chart. The single fared well on multiple \"Billboard\" component charts, reaching the top spot on the Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs) tally, and becoming her second consecutive number-one on the chart following \"We Belong Together\" as well as her sixth number-one overall. It peaked at number two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, and number 27 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. \"Shake It Off\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of over 1,000,000 copies.\n\n\"Shake It Off\" was released throughout Australia and New Zealand as the third single from \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" in late 2005. In the United Kingdom, it was released as a double A-side along with \"Get Your Number,\" the third single serviced to the United States at the same time. The single performed well outside the United States, reaching number five and six on the Australian Singles Chart, and New Zealand Singles Chart, respectively. The single was later certified Gold in Australia by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipments of over 35,000 units. On the UK Singles Chart, the song debuted at number nine during the week of October 15, 2005. Dropping to number ten the following week, the song lasted a total of eight weeks in the singles chart before making its descent.\n\n\"Shake It Off\" became another remix in which Carey would feature a hip-hop artist, having done so several times in the past. Most notably, Carey began incorporating hip-hop and pop from her 1995 remix of her single \"Fantasy\", which featured rap verses from Ol' Dirty Bastard (O.D.B.). The song was considered one of the pioneering songs that began the infusion of the \"thug-love duet\". According to Kelefa Sanneh of \"The New York Times\", the song \"Nowadays clean-cut pop stars are expected to collaborate with roughneck rappers, but when Ms. Carey teamed up with Ol' Dirty Bastard, of the Wu-Tang Clan, for the 1995 hit 'Fantasy (Remix),' it was a surprise, and a smash.\" Originally intended to feature only Jay-Z, the remix included rising rapper Young Jeezy, who considered the position the \"highest-profile guest appearance to date\" that he had been offered. In an interview with MTV News, Jeezy described how he came to be included on the remix:\n\nWhen I got the call [from Mariah], I was like, 'I don't know if that's me. She was like, 'Nah, it's gonna be your type of beat.' I'm like, 'Oh, for real?' Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna do it with you.' I was like, 'Dag, this is big.' But when I did it, I kept it me and kept it 'hood. At first I ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was a wrap. That's history. Mariah is known for doing remixes with street cats from Mobb Deep to O.D.B., so to be a part of that was a good look for me and the Def Jam movement.\n\nAccording to Jayanathi Daniel, writer of \"The New York Sun\", Carey's remixes of \"Shake If Off\" and \"It's Like That\" helped cement her impression on the music scene during the release of \"The Emancipation of Mimi\", writing \"the multiple mix tapes, further legitimized her return.\" In a review of Jay-Z's material at the time, an editor at \"XXL\" rated the remix two out of five stars, criticizing his lyrics and \"swag\", which he felt were missing during lines reading \"The Emancipation of M-I-M-I / I spray semi rrrah, rrrrah / Twenty worldwide nigga get your plaques / Guess who the fuck got his swagger back?\". He concluded on a mixed note, writing \"With run-of-the-mill punchlines and a dated reference to \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\", Jay seems to be missing some of his usual swagger on this white label–only remix.\"\n\nThe song's music video was originally scheduled to be directed by Brett Ratner, who had shot Carey's previous two videos. However, Jake Nava was used as the director instead, as Ratner had other obligations regarding one of his films. It was filmed during the end of June 2005. When describing the video's concept to MTV News, Carey said \"I actually just got the treatment. We came up with some cool concepts.\" When asked for a more detailed synopsis, Carey declined and responded \"It's \"really technical. It's a new approach that I would have to let [the director] explain. It's new territory.\" During a scene in the video in which Carey had to wear very high-heeled pumps, she had the video crew carry her to various sections of the set. When Nava suggested she wear a pair of sensible flat footwear in between shoots, Carey jokingly replied \"my feet repel them dahling.\" When recalling the moment in a later interview, Carey claimed her feet were \"in agony\" and said \"My high heels had left my feet bleeding. Laugh all you want, my feet hurt.\" \n\nThe single's video was directed by Jake Nava, and contains numerous wardrobe changes by Carey in a storyline involving luxurious scenery in which the singer leaves her significant other. It is presented in one continuous shot, with no edits. The video begins with a TV screen and the word 'Mimi' appearing, while on the monitor, Dupri raps his introduction. As the television fades, Carey is then shown lying in a bathtub overflowing with water and rose petals, with her hair flowing over the side of the tub. Next, the camera follows down one floor of the mansion to find Carey, decked out in bright blue makeup and high heels, as she sings \"By the time you get this message / It's gonna be too late / So don't bother paging me / 'Cause I'll be on my way,\" into the phone, which she then throws against the wall. A short scene is then shown of her lover in a strip club, receiving the message Carey had sent him. As he reads it, he blows smoke into the screen, fading to reveal Carey dressed in a sleeveless black coat and dress, before grabbing her bag and heading out the door as she sings, \"So I packed up my Louis Vuitton / Jumped in your ride and took off.\"\n\nAs she leaves the mansion, she exits into \"Emancipation Street\", a ghetto looking plaza made up entirely of props and hand made stores on a painted backdrop. With shops named \"So So Fetch\" and \"Pink Yet Lavender\", Carey then walks up to a brick wall, where she passes Dupri, who makes a cameo appearance. As she leans on the wall, her coat slips off, and two schoolgirls do a shake dance at the pay phones. As the camera pans upwards to the wall to a sign featuring a photo of Carey and the song's title, Carey then appears driving away in a Lamborghini Murcielago speaking on her PDA with Chris Tucker, who as a cameo, appears on the set of the video shoot, as the man in the passenger's seat. As Carey leaves her lover a second message, he is seen frolicking pool-side with two other women, while she says \"with this one and that one / By the pool, on the beach, in the streets.\" Her phone breaks up as she drives past the \"Hollyhood\" sign, so she tells him, \"Hold on,\" singing, \"Save this recording, because I'm never coming back home.\" Carey is then shown on bleachers at a high school football game, with Da Brat featured as a cameo act, as she argues with a man in the background. She writes 'MiMi' on one of the bleachers and the letters transform into a large shiny \"MIMI\" sign made of lights, which appear in large, vibrant lights. Carey walks up to a microphone in front of the large 'MIMI' lights, and dances and sings in front of the camera, wearing a revealing black ensemble and leopard print boots. In the final scene, Carey is seen on a beach, as she slips out of her robe and walks into the sunset, with the glare obscuring whether she's wearing any clothing.\n\nThe video was nominated for a MTV Video Music Award at the 2006 ceremony, in the category of Best R&B Video, but lost to Beyoncé's \"Check On It\". The song's music video generated strong public reaction, topping the Total Request Live (TRL) music video countdown in its second week in release. Additionally, the music video received strong rotation on MTV, VH1 and BET, having over 500,000 requests in its first 24 hours. Similarly, at the time, music videos were predominantly watched on television, as sites like YouTube were not yet popular. During this period, Yahoo! and AOL began allowing the public to view videos free of charge on their website, allowing them to stream as well. After the launch of the websites, \"Billboard\" announced that the video for \"Shake It Off\" had generated over two million requests on its first day of release, setting a record at the time for the websites. It peaked at number two on \"Billboard\"s Hot Videoclip Tracks chart. The video was well received by fans and critics alike, with a writer from \"The Sacramento Bee\" writing how he thought it was impressive that Carey at 35, and with over fifteen years in the business, had arranged such a popular video. He also described it as \"sassy, fun and ghetto\", while outing it as one of her best videos.\n\nFollowing the release of \"It's Like That\", Carey embarked on several stateside, European and Asian promotional tours in support of \"The Emancipation of Mimi\", as well as its accompanying singles. In the United Kingdom, Carey filmed a two-part appearance on the British music program \"Top of the Pops\", performing \"It's Like That\", \"We Belong Together\" and \"Shake It Off\". After returning to the United States for the a string of televised performances, Carey performed \"Shake It Off\" at \"Good Morning America\". On August 3, \"USA Today\" announced that Carey would be added to the roster of performers at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, held on the 28th of the month. The ceremony was held at the American Airlines Arena in downtown Miami Beach Florida, with Carey's performance taking place at the National Hotel in South Beach. Apart from The Killers, she was the only performer to tape their appearance from an undisclosed location in Miami. After being introduced by Eva Longoria, Carey appeared on a long stage in the hotel's courtyard, with Dupri opening the song with his rap verses in a nearby cabana. After performing \"Shake It Off\" and the official remix version of \"We Belong Together,\" Carey made her way into the shallow pool, followed by Dupri and the back-up dancers.\n\nAt the 2005 World Music Awards, Carey performed \"Shake It Off\" alongside Dupri. Wearing black shorts and a pink blouse, the performance started as Carey got out of a Lamborghini Murciélago on stage, a re-enactment of the video. Additionally, a large lighted 'MIMI' sign was placed behind the stage, also a prop used at the end of the song's music video. The following week, Carey performed the song, as well as its accompanying number \"Get Your Number,\" on the British music chart program, \"Top of the Pops\". On November 15, 2005, the \"Chicago Tribune\" announced that Carey would perform during half-time of the Thanksgiving game between the Detroit Lions and the Atlanta Falcons. Airing on the 24th, Carey performed \"Shake It Off\", as well as her newly released single from the album's re-release, \"Don't Forget About Us\". Two months later, she celebrated the new year on television, placing as the featured performer at the Times Square Ball drop on New Year's Eve in New York. The special, titled \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest\", aired on ABC at 10 pm on December 31, and featured Carey on stage wearing a short sparkling dress, and performing a selection of the album's singles, including \"Shake It Off\". Aside from performing the song live on several high-profile televised events, Carey included the song on both her Adventures of Mimi and Angels Advocate Tours. On the former tour, the performance began as a large Broadway-styled prop reading 'MIMI', similar to the one from the video, descended from the rafters. As the song began, Carey walked down a spiraled staircase, ushered by one of her several back up dancers. Sporting a black bikini and matching sheer cape, Carey sang the song while, according to some critics, performing some of her most diverse physical movements from the entire show. On her Angels Advocate Tour, Carey performed the song during the first quarter of the concert. According to Ryan J. Downey of MTV News, Carey gave a \"rousing rendition\" of the song, and \"set the tone for what felt like a celebratory evening.\"\n\nAustralian CD single\n\nSweden CD single \n\nUnited States 12\" single \n\nCredits for \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\n"}

The oft-quoted one relates to a poor village boy nicknamed Gouzhai. At 14, he became an apprentice at a food store. Thereafter, he set up his own shop specialising in selling steamed, stuffed baozi. His supposedly very delicious baozi soon gained immense popularity in a short period of time. As a result, Gouzhai got too preoccupied with his business to converse with his customers. So, they started to complain, \"Gouzhai does not talk to people.\" (which loosely translates as ).\n\nIn another similar story, there was a boy named Gao Guiyou who had a terrible attitude and could ignore people for days if he was angered. Thus, he was named by his mother Goubuli (his nickname \"Gou\" with \"Buli\" meaning \"ignores\"). At 14, Gou was sent by his father to Tianjin where he gained apprenticeship at a food shop and, after mastering his skills, setup his own shop named \"Goubuli\". Goubuli buns soon become popular with the Tianjin locals.\n\nIn 2008, in anticipation of the 2008 Summer Olympics which were to be held in Beijing, Goubuli decided to adopt an English name, \"Go Believe\", in hope of better name recognition by foreign guests.

{"id": "1911078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911078", "title": "Object composition", "text": "Object composition\n\nIn computer science, object composition is a way to combine objects or data types into more complex ones. Compositions relate to, but are not the same as, data structures, and common ones are the tagged union, set, sequence, and various graph structures, as well as the object used in object-oriented programming.\n\nObject composition refers to the logical or conceptual structure of the information, not the implementation or physical data structure used to represent it. For example, a sequence differs from a set because (among other things) the order of the composed items matters for the former but not the latter. Data structures such as arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and many others can be used to implement either of them. Perhaps confusingly, some of the same terms are used for both data structures and composites. For example, \"binary tree\" can refer to either: as a data structure it is a means of accessing a linear sequence of items, and the actual positions of items in the tree are irrelevant (the tree can be internally rearranged however one likes, without changing its meaning). However, as an object composition, the positions are relevant, and changing them would change the meaning (as for example in cladograms).\n\nIn programming, types can often be divided into composite and noncomposite types, and composition can be regarded as a relationship between types: an object of a composite type (e.g. \"car\") \"has\" objects of other types (e.g. \"wheel\"). When a composite object contains several sub-objects of the same type, they may be assigned to particular roles, often distinguished by names or numbers. For example, a Point object might contain 3 numbers, each representing distance along a different axis, such as 'x', 'y', and 'z'. The study of part-whole relationships in general, is mereology. \n\nComposition must be distinguished from subtyping, which is the process of adding detail to a general data type to create a more specific data type. For instance, cars may be a specific type of vehicle: \"car\" is a \"vehicle\". Subtyping doesn't describe a relationship between different objects, but instead, says that objects of a type are simultaneously objects of another type. The study of such relationships is ontology.\n\nComposite objects may be represented in storage by co-locating the composed items, by co-locating references, or in many other ways. The items within a composite object may be referred to as \"attributes\", \"fields\", \"members\", \"properties\", or other names, and the resulting composition as \"composite type\", \"storage record\", \"structure\", \"tuple\", or a \"user-defined type (UDT)\". For details, see the aggregation section below.\n\nIn UML, there are two ways of modeling composites: Composition and aggregation. Thus in UML, composition has a more narrow meaning than in ordinary language:\n\nComposition is depicted as a filled diamond and a solid line.\n\nComposition is a kind of association where the composite object has sole \"\"responsibility for the existence and storage of the composed objects\"\". The relationship between the composite and the component is a strong “has a” relationship, as the composite object takes ownership of the component. This means the composite is responsible for the creation and destruction of the component parts. An object may only be part of one composite. If the composite object is destroyed, all the component parts must be destroyed. The part has no life of itself and cannot be transferred to another object. Composition enforces encapsulation as the component parts usually are members of the composite object.\nThe more general form, aggregation, is depicted as an unfilled diamond and a solid line.\n\nAggregation is a kind of association that specifies a whole/part relationship between the aggregate (whole) and component part. This relationship between the aggregate and component is a weak \"has-a\" relationship, as the component may outlive the aggregate object. The component object may be accessed through other objects without going through the aggregate object. The aggregate object does not take part in the lifecycle of the component object, meaning the component object may outlive the aggregate object. The state of the component object still forms part of the aggregate object.\n\nA C++ implementation could be something like this:\n// Composition:\nclass Car {\n\n// Aggregation:\nclass Pond {\n\nThis is an example of composition in C.\n\nstruct Person\n\nIn this example, the primitive (noncomposite) types int, enum {job_seeking, professional, non_professional, retired, student} and the composite array type char[] are combined to form the composite structure Person. Each Person structure then \"has an\" age, name, and an employment type.\n\nObjects can be composed recursively, and are then called recursive types. Examples includes various kinds of trees, DAGs, and graphs. Each node in a tree may be a branch or leaf; in other words, each node is a tree at the same time when it belongs to another tree.\n\nC calls a record a struct or structure; object-oriented languages such as Java, Smalltalk, and C++ often keep their records hidden inside objects (class instances); languages in the ML family simply call them records. COBOL was the first widespread programming language to support records directly; ALGOL 68 got it from COBOL and Pascal got it, more or less indirectly, from ALGOL 68. Common Lisp provides structures and classes (the latter via the Common Lisp Object System).\n\n\n\nArrays were the only composite data type in Algol 60.\n\nFor example, a linked list might be declared as:\nFor ALGOL 68 only the type name appears to the left of the equality, and most notably the construction is made – and can be read – from left to right without regard to priorities.\n\n\ntype\n\nstruct newtypet {\n} newarrayt[10] [max + 1];\nFortran 77 has arrays, but lacked any formal record/structure definitions. Typically compound structures were built up using EQUIVALENCE or COMMON statements:\n\n\ntype Cust is\nAda 95 brought OOP concepts through tagged types (the equivalent of a C++ class), Ada 2012 added support for substitution verification through class-wide contracts. \n\nconst int max = 99;\nclass {\n}newtypet[10] [max + 1];\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\nmax = 99\nclass NewTypeT:\nnewarrayt = -->\n\nComposition that is used to store several instances of the composited data type is referred to as containment. Examples of such containers are arrays, associative arrays, binary trees, and linked lists.\n\nIn UML, containment is depicted with a multiplicity of 1 or 0..\"n\" (depending on the issue of ownership), indicating that the data type is composed of an unknown number of instances of the composited data type.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1911084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911084", "title": "Function composition (computer science)", "text": "Function composition (computer science)\n\nIn computer science, function composition is an act or mechanism to combine simple functions to build more complicated ones. Like the usual composition of functions in mathematics, the result of each function is passed as the argument of the next, and the result of the last one is the result of the whole.\n\nProgrammers frequently apply functions to results of other functions, and almost all programming languages allow it. In some cases, the composition of functions is interesting as a function in its own right, to be used later. Such a function can always be defined but languages with first-class functions make it easier.\n\nThe ability to easily compose functions encourages factoring (breaking apart) functions for maintainability and code reuse. More generally, big systems might be built by composing whole programs.\n\nNarrowly speaking, function composition applies to functions that operate on a finite amount of data, each step sequentially processing it before handing it to the next. Functions that operate on potentially infinite data (a stream or other codata) are known as filters, and are instead connected in a pipeline, which is analogous to function composition and can execute concurrently.\n\nFor example, suppose we have two functions formula_1 and formula_2, as in formula_3 and formula_4. Composing them means we first compute formula_4, and then use formula_6 to compute formula_3. Here is the example in the C language:\nfloat x, y, z;\ny = g(x);\nz = f(y);\nThe steps can be combined if we don't give a name to the intermediate result:\n\nz = f(g(x));\nDespite differences in length, these two implementations compute the same result. The second implementation requires only one line of code and is colloquially referred to as a \"highly composed\" form. Readability and hence maintainability is one advantage of highly composed forms, since they require fewer lines of code, minimizing a program's \"surface area\". DeMarco and Lister empirically verify an inverse relationship between surface area and maintainability. On the other hand, it may be possible to overuse highly composed forms. A nesting of too many functions may have the opposite effect, making the code less maintainable.\n\nIn a stack-based language, functional composition is even more natural: it is performed by concatenation, and is usually the primary method of program design. The above example in Forth:\nWhich will take whatever was on the stack before, apply g, then f, and leave the result on the stack. See postfix composition notation for the corresponding mathematical notation.\n\nNow suppose that the combination of calling f() on the result of g() is frequently useful, and which we want to name foo() to be used as a function in its own right.\n\nIn most languages, we can define a new function implemented by composition. Example in C:\nfloat foo(float x) {\n\n(the long form with intermediates would work as well.) Example in Forth:\n\nIn languages such as C, the only way to create a new function is to define it in the program source, which means that functions can't be composed at run time. An evaluation of an arbitrary composition of \"predefined\" functions, however, is possible:\n\ntypedef int FXN(int);\n\nint eval(FXN *fs[], int size, int x)\n\nint main()\n\nIn functional programming languages, function composition can be naturally expressed as a higher-order function or operator. In other programming languages you can write your own mechanisms to perform function composition.\n\nIn Haskell, the example given above becomes:\nusing the built-in composition operator (.), which can be read as \"f after g\" or \"g composed with f\".\n\nThe composition operator itself can be defined in Haskell using a lambda expression:\n\n(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c\nf . g = \\x -> f (g x)\n\nThe first lines describes the type of (.) - it takes a pair of functions and returns a function.\nNote that Haskell doesn't require specification of the exact input and output types of f and g,\nonly the relations between them (f must accept what g returns). This makes (.) a polymorphic operator.\nVariants of Lisp, especially Scheme, the interchangeability of code and data together with the treatment of functions lend themselves extremely well for a recursive definition of a variadic compositional operator.\n\n(define (add-a-bang str)\n\n(define givebang\n\n(givebang 'set) ; ===> set!\n\n((compose sqrt negate square) 5) ; ===> 0+5i\n\nMany dialects of APL feature built in function composition using the symbol codice_1. \nThis higher-order function extends function composition to dyadic application of the left side function such that codice_2 is codice_3.\nfoo←f∘g\nAdditionally, you can define function composition:\nIn dialect that does not support inline definition using braces, the traditional definition is available:\n∇ r←(f o g)x\n\nRaku like Haskell has a built in function composition operator, the main difference is it is spelled as codice_1 or codice_5.\nmy &foo = &f ∘ &g;\nAlso like Haskell you could define the operator yourself. In fact the following is the Raku code used to define it in the Rakudo implementation.\nproto sub infix:<∘> (&?, &?) is equiv(&[~]) is assoc<left> {*}\n\nmulti sub infix:<∘> () { *.self } # allows `[∘] @array` to work when `@array` is empty\nmulti sub infix:<∘> (&f) { &f } # allows `[∘] @array` to work when `@array` has one element\nmulti sub infix:<∘> (&f, &g --> Block) {\n\nmy &infix:<o> := &infix:<∘>;\n\nIn Python, a way to define the composition for any group of functions, is using reduce function (use functools.reduce in Python 3):\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef compose(*funcs) -> int:\n\nf = lambda x: x + 1\ng = lambda x: x * 2\nh = lambda x: x - 3\n\nprint(compose(f, g, h)(10))\n\nIn JavaScript we can define it as a function which takes two functions f and g, and produces a function:\n\nfunction o(f, g) {\n\n// Alternatively, using the rest operator and lambda expressions in ES2015\nconst compose = (...fs) => (x) => fs.reduceRight((acc, f) => f(acc), x)\nIn C# we can define it as a Func which takes two Funcs f and g, and produces a Func:\n\n// Call example:\n// var c = Compose(f, g);\n// Func<int, bool> g = _ => ...\n// Func<bool, string> f = _ => ...\n\nFunc<TIn, TOut> Compose<TIn, TMid, TOut>(Func<TMid, TOut> f, Func<TIn, TMid> g) => _ => f(g(_));\n\nLanguages like Ruby let you construct a binary operator yourself:\n\nclass Proc\nend\n\n(f + g).call(12) # => 13824\nHowever, a native function composition operator was introduced in Ruby 2.6:\n\nNotions of composition, including the principle of compositionality and composability, are so ubiquitous that numerous strands of research have separately evolved. The following is a sampling of the kind of research in which the notion of composition is central.\n\n\nWhole programs or systems can be treated as functions, which can be readily composed if their inputs and outputs are well-defined pipelines allowing easy composition of filters were so successful that it became a design pattern of operating systems.\n\nImperative procedures with side effects violate referential transparency and therefore are not cleanly composable. However if you consider the \"state of the world\" before and after running the code as its input and output, you get a clean function. Composition of such functions corresponds to running the procedures one after the other. The monads formalism uses this idea to incorporate side effects and I/O into functional languages.\n\n\n"}

They are native to the island of Madagascar, which is off the African mainland, where they are known to be found inside of rotting logs. It is one of some 20 known species of large hissing roaches from Madagascar, many of which are kept as pets, and often confused with one another by pet dealers; in particular, \"G. portentosa\" is commonly confused with \"G. oblongonota\" and \"G. picea\".\n\nUnlike most cockroaches, they are wingless. They are excellent climbers and can scale smooth glass. Males can be distinguished from females by their thicker, hairier antennae and the very pronounced \"horns\" on the pronotum. Females carry the ootheca internally, and release the young nymphs only after her offspring have emerged within her. As in some other wood-inhabiting roaches, the parents and offspring will commonly remain in close physical contact for extended periods of time. In captivity, these insects have been known to live up to 5 years. They feed primarily on vegetable material.\n\nAs the common name suggests, the Madagascar hissing cockroach is characterized by their hissing sound, which is produced when they forcefully expel air through the specially-adapted respiratory openings (spiracles) on the fourth segment of their body, though spiracles are found on all segments of their abdomen. The Madagascar hissing cockroach is only one member of a group of roaches that can hiss; this exact mode of sound production is atypical, as most insects that make sound do so by rubbing together various body parts (\"stridulation\"), such as legs. Some long-horned beetles, e.g., the giant Fijian long-horned beetle, hiss by squeezing air out from under their elytra, but this does not involve the spiracles. In hissing roaches, the hiss takes three forms: the disturbance hiss, the female-attracting hiss, and the aggressive fighting hiss. All cockroaches from the fourth instar (fourth molting cycle) and older are capable of the disturbance hiss. Only males use the female-attracting hiss and fighting hiss; the latter is used when challenged by other males (males will establish a dominance hierarchy, and a submissive male will back down to end a fight). The hissing makes them a popular pet.\n\nThe mite species \"Gromphadorholaelaps schaeferi\" lives on this species of cockroach along the undersides and bases of the legs and takes some of its host's food as well as consuming particulates along the host's body. As these mites do not harm the cockroaches they live upon, they are commensals, not parasites, unless they build up to abnormal levels and start starving their host. Recent studies have shown that these mites also may have beneficial qualities for the cockroaches, in that they clean the surfaces of the cockroaches of pathogenic mold spores, which in turn increases the life expectancy of the cockroaches.\n\nThe Madagascar hissing cockroach has been known to be featured in Hollywood movies, prominently in \"Bug\" (1975) as cockroaches who could set fires by rubbing their legs together and, in \"Damnation Alley\" (1977), as post-nuclear-war mutant armor-plated \"killer\" cockroaches. In \"Starship Troopers\", a movie about a war against an enemy called \"The Bugs\", a teacher is shown encouraging her students to step on this species as part of a TV propaganda broadcast.\n\nA Madagascar hissing cockroach was used by artist Garnet Hertz as the driver of a mobile robotic artwork. They were used in the reality television series \"Fear Factor\". The species also made an appearance in the movie \"Men in Black\" in 1997. This was later parodied in the comedy \"\" (2004), where one emerges from Kim Jong-il's body after his death, enters a tiny spaceship, and flies away.\nIn September 2006, amusement park Six Flags Great America announced that it would be granting unlimited line-jumping privileges for all rides to anyone who could eat a live Madagascar hissing cockroach as part of a Halloween-themed FrightFest. Furthermore, if a contestant managed to beat the previous world record (eating 36 cockroaches in 1 minute), he would receive season passes for four people during the 2007 season. Raw cockroaches contain a mild neurotoxin that numbs the mouth and makes it difficult to swallow. The promotion ended on October 29, 2006.\n\nIn January 2016 and 2017, Bronx Zoo held a roach-naming program themed for Valentine's Day, allowing their cockroaches to be named by benefactors. Funds raised were donated to Wildlife Conservation Society.\n\nMadagascar cockroaches can be kept as exotic pets. They require a small living area with an area for them to hide because they dislike light sources. The cockroaches prefer warmth and they cannot function in cold weather. Due to their propensity to climb, the living area must be tested to see if they can climb it as they do in their natural environment. Fish tanks with screens work best but it is also wise to coat the first few inches with petroleum jelly to keep them from getting out of the habitat that they are kept in. They can live on fresh vegetables along with any kind of pellet food that is high in protein, such as dry dog food.\n\nIn the USA, some states require permits before this species can be kept as a pet or in breeding colonies. The state of Florida requires such a permit. In fact, during outreach programs, the University of Florida's Department of Entomology and Nematology, which has such a permit, allows only males to be taken out of the laboratory. This is to prevent the possible introduction of a pregnant female into the environment.\nIt is also possible to raise them to feed other pets, as they are reasonably high in protein. Reptiles are often given roaches as food.\n\n"}

His son, Chip Sansom, who started assisting on the strip in 1989, is the current artist. The strip is distributed by Newspaper Enterprise Association. The Sansoms won the 1987 National Cartoonists Society Humor Comic Strip Award and the 1990 Newspaper Comic Strip Award.\n\nArt Sansom created \"The Born Loser\" after spending 20 years churning out the illustrations on his syndicate's serious strips. He originally titled it \"The Loser\", but under the urging of the syndicate, renamed it \"The Born Loser\". The dailies started May 10, 1965 while the Sundays premiered on June 27. Initially, the strip had no recurring characters but now focuses on the Thornapple family and the few people in their lives.\n\nBrutus P. \"Thorny\" Thornapple – As the name of the comic implies, he's a born loser. He simply can't get a break, whether it involves his job, his family, or just plain every day life. He's rather old fashioned, perhaps explaining why the modern times seem to be running him over. His birthday is November 29, 1951, though the May 10, 2011 edition proclaimed it to be his 46th birthday.\n\nGladys \"Hornet\" Thornapple – Brutus's wife, she's even more old fashioned than Brutus and doesn't seem to be very bright, especially with popular culture or technology. Taller than Brutus, with blond hair, she's rather similar to Edith \"Dingbat\" Bunker. She can be a bit scolding of Brutus, and often gets into fights with him that he simply cannot win. Nevertheless, their relationship always seems to be intact.\n\nWilberforce Thornapple – The son of the Thornapple family, he's a very curious boy who looks up to his father and often turns to him for advice. He is friends with his neighbor Hurricane Hattie, and enjoys baseball, but he's not very good at it. He currently wears his blond hair in a crew cut but in the 1970s, when boys and men tended to wear much longer hair, he wore his hair in sausage curls, and wore sailor-type suits with shorts. His appearance looked much more boyish with the new hairstyle as his wardrobe was updated with jeans, sweatshirts, and tennis shoes.\n\nRancid W. \"Rank\" Veeblefester – Brutus's boss, a rich tycoon. A very cranky, unpleasant man, he works in an office surrounded by money bags and doesn't seem to do any real work. He always scolds Brutus for being incompetent and seems to enjoy tormenting him. He loves to give a seemingly nice remark to Brutus to get his hopes up, and then turns it around as an insult (one example being that the only empty cubicle in the entire office belongs to Brutus). It's often a wonder how Brutus, who dubs him \"Chief,\" manages to escape being fired by him; this implies that Rancid is satisfied with Brutus' work and simply enjoys terrorizing him. Even in their home lives, nothing changes (such as when Brutus wants to borrow the lawnmower and Veeblefester tells him not to take it out of the yard). Deserves to be dragged out into the street and shot, by way of his sadistic nature. His wife's name is \"Lividea\", a play on the word \"livid\"; presumably she is as unpleasant as her husband. The character's name is a variation on veeblefetzer, a word popularized in the 1950s by Harvey Kurtzman in early issues of \"Mad\".\n\nRamona Gargle – Gladys's mother. A stereotypical mother in law, she often visits to pepper Brutus with insults and emotional anguish. However, Brutus does occasionally gets his own jibes back at \"Mother Gargle\".\n\nHurricane Hattie O'Hara – The mischievous girl next door, she delights in menacing pretty much any adult she encounters, namely Brutus and her teacher.\n\nOther characters regularly featured are the Thornapple family dog, Kewpie; Miss Fungus, Wilberforce and Hattie's school teacher; and Wastrel P. Gravesite, a bum who regularly hounds Brutus for money.\n\nKewpie the Dog Voice of reason, basically the Thornapple version of Garfield.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1911151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911151", "title": "Conflict between good and evil", "text": "Conflict between good and evil\n\nThe conflict between good and evil is one of the most common conventional themes in literature, and is considered to be a universal part of the human condition.. There are several variations on this conflict, one being the battle between individuals or ideologies, with one side held up as \"Good\", while the other is portrayed as \"Evil\". Another variation is the inner struggle in characters (and by extension, humans in reality) between good and evil. \n\nThe form of tragedy described as best by Aristotle and exemplified by \"Oedipus Rex\" is, properly, concerned more with the tragic operations of fate than with a thematized conflict between good and evil. Nevertheless, the conflict between the good and the flawed aspects of the tragic hero form an important part of tragic catharsis in Aristotle's theory. There is, moreover, the form of tragedy with a happy ending that, although denigrated from Aristotle, was quite common in antiquity. This form, perhaps best exemplified by the Alcestis of Euripides, ends with a hero or god decisively beating an evil character. Northrop Frye has suggested that this form of \"tragedy\" is, in fact, the basic template for melodrama.\nWriters from the earliest times have thematized the conflict between good and evil, understood, of course, in religious terms. In the Old Testament, Yahweh asks the prophet Jeremiah: \"The heart is devious above all else; it is perverse—who can understand it?\" (, NRSV). Compare also the Book of Job.\nIn addition to explicating classical myth and stories to reveal a hidden conflict between good and evil in them, they wrote into their own texts different versions of the conflict. The basic forms may be described as the apocalyptic, in which the writer describes real, social events (whether historical or imagined) as manifestations of the eternal conflict between God and Satan, good and evil — a struggle that, if controlled in the end by God's omnipotence, was nevertheless of deep importance for humans. In a different way, Christian writers could focus on the internal struggle to find or maintain belief. This literature is exemplified by the \"Psychomachia\" of Prudentius, whose title continues to signify great psychological turmoil, and supremely by Augustine of Hippo's \"Confessions\", the model for countless later psychological biographies. Special mention might also be made of the \"Consolation of Philosophy\" of Boethius, a work that combines Platonic, Christian, and Stoic thought on the nature of suffering.\n\nJoseph Conrad defined all humans as having an \"inner evil\" or \"Heart of Darkness\" in his novella of the same name.\n\nWhile certainly not as widely seen as the direct good vs. evil conflict, the concept of \"individual vs. self\" is often much more compelling to a reader/watcher, especially if it is the protagonist. In both literature and film, it requires well-written character development in order to truly succeed.\n\nJoseph Conrad's version of the inner evil conflict, known as the Heart of Darkness, is a human's struggle with their own morals, and their own battle with their hidden evil. Although first chiefly used in the novel, this improved device was commonly used, as opposed to the old devices used in literature before the turn of the century. It is a conflict that exists outside of literature as well, making it a universal truth of the human condition.\n\n"}

He is known for major discoveries in cell and developmental biology related to the dynamics and function of the cytoskeleton, the regulation of the cell cycle, and the process of signaling in embryos, as well as the evolution of the vertebrate body plan. He is a leader in applying mathematical approaches to biology. He is the John Franklin Enders University Professor at Harvard University.\n\nKirschner was born in Chicago, Illinois, on February 28, 1945. He graduated from Northwestern University with a B.A. in chemistry in 1966. In 1971, he received his doctorate in biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nHe held postdoctoral positions at UC Berkeley and at the University of Oxford in England. He became assistant professor at Princeton University in 1972. In 1978 he was made professor at the University of California, San Francisco. In 1993, he moved to Harvard Medical School, where he served as the chair of the new Department of Cell Biology for a decade. He became the founding chair of the HMS Department of Systems Biology in 2003. He was named the John Franklin Enders University Professor in 2009. In 2018, he was succeeded as Chair of the Department of Systems Biology by Galit Lahav.\n\nKirschner studies how cells divide, how they generate their shape, how they control their size, and how embryos develop. In his eclectic lab, developmental work on the frog coexists with biochemical work on mechanism of ubiquitination, cytoskeleton assembly or signal transduction.\n\nAt Princeton, his early work on microtubules established their unusual molecular assembly from tubulin proteins and identified the first microtubule-stabilizing protein tau, later shown to be a major component of the neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. In studies at UC San Francisco of the frog embryo as a model system of cell development, Kirschner identified the first inducer of embryonic differentiation, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), an early finding in the field of signal transduction.\n\nKirschner's lab is also known for uncovering basic mechanisms of the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells. Working in Xenopus (frog) egg extracts, Kirschner and Andrew Murray showed that cyclin synthesis drives the cell cycle and, later, that ubiquitin regulates levels of cyclin by marking the cell-cycle molecule for destruction. His lab discovered and purified many of the components involved in cell cycle progression, including anaphase promoting complex (APC), the complex that ubiquitinates cyclin B.\n\nA second noted finding was his discovery, with Tim Mitchison, of the dynamic instability of microtubules, In mitosis, for example, microtubules form the spindle that separates the chromosomes. The first step in spindle formation is the nucleation of microtubules by microtubule-organizing centers, which then grow in all directions. Microtubules that attach to a chromosome are stabilized and are therefore retained to form part of the spindle. Because of dynamic instability, some individual microtubules that are not stabilized are at risk of collapse (or “catastrophe” as Kirschner named it), allowing re-use of the tubulin monomers. This recognition of self-organization in biological systems has been highly influential, and helped shape the view of the cytoplasm as a collection of dynamic molecular machines.\n\nKirschner is also interested in the evolutionary origins of the vertebrate body plan. Together with John Gerhart, he was instrumental in developing the acorn worm Saccoglossus kowalevskii into a model system that could be used to study the divergence between hemichordates and chordates, and the evolution of the chordate nervous system.\n\nKirschner is a pioneer in using mathematical approaches to learn about central biological questions. For example, a model of the Wnt pathway he developed in collaboration with the late Reinhart Heinrich showed that new properties and constraints emerge when the individual biochemical steps are combined into a complete pathway. A talk he gave on mathematics and the future of medicine at a retreat for Department Chairs at Harvard Medical School in 2003 inspired the Dean, Joseph B. Martin, to found a new Department, the Department of Systems Biology, with Kirschner as founding chair. Since then, Kirschner's lab has attracted many students and post-docs from theoretical backgrounds who wish to make the transition into biology. His lab is now a leader in using mathematical tools to analyze signaling pathways, cell size control, and the selectivity of drugs.\n\nIn two books co-authored with John Gerhart, Kirschner has described the cellular and developmental underpinnings of the evolution of organisms, and the concept of \"evolvability\". In the most recent book, Kirschner and Gerhart proposed a new theory of \"facilitated variation\" that aims to answer the question: How can small, random genetic changes be converted into useful changes in complex body parts? \n\nKirschner has been an advocate for federal biomedical research funding and served as first chair of the Joint Steering Committee for Public Policy, a coalition of scientific societies he helped create in 1993 to educate the U.S. Congress on biomedical research and lobby for public funding of it. In 2014, Kirschner (together with Bruce Alberts, Shirley Tilghman and Harold Varmus) called for a number of changes to the system of US biomedical science, with the intention of reducing \"hypercompetition\" This publication led to the formation of an organization, Rescuing Biomedical Research, that aims to collect community input and propose changes to the structure of academic science in the USA.\n\nKirschner helped launch the monthly, peer-reviewed journal \"PLoS Biology\" in October 2003 as a member of the editorial board and senior author of a paper in the inaugural issue. The journal was the first publishing venture from the San Francisco-based Public Library of Science (PLoS), which had begun three years previously as a grassroots organization of scientists advocating free and unrestricted access to the scientific literature\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1911178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911178", "title": "Gateway (comics)", "text": "Gateway (comics)\n\nGateway is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character has been depicted as an Australian mutant with the ability to teleport objects and people from one location to another. He is considered an unofficial member of the X-Men.\n\nGateway first appeared in \"Uncanny X-Men\" #229 (May 1988), and was created by Chris Claremont and Marc Silvestri.\n\nMuch of Gateway's past remains a mystery to this day, including where exactly he was born and even his name. He is an Aboriginal who appears to have grown up in the Outback.\n\nHe serves the criminal group the Reavers in repayment for an undisclosed favor they did him. As extra assurance of his loyalty, they threaten to destroy an Aboriginal holy place if he betrays them. They call him \"Gateway\" in reference to his ability to create gateways between two points in space. Some time later, the X-Men appear in the Outback and attack the Reavers' headquarters. Though Gateway helps the Reavers Skullbuster, Bonebreaker, and Pretty Boy escape, the X-Men realize he is not a Reaver.\n\nThe X-Men take up residence in the Reavers' former hideout, and Gateway begins voluntarily using his powers to assist them. Initially, since he seems unable or unwilling to speak, Psylocke uses her telepathic powers to communicate to Gateway where the X-Men wish to go. However, they soon realize he always knows their desired destination without being told. He also used the Dreamtime to observe the growing corruption of the X-Men’s ally, Madelyne Pryor, by Limbo demons, yet did neither intervene nor alert any of the X-Men to the growing danger in their backyard just because that was not his purpose in the scheme of things. \n\nWhen Gateway teleported the female X-Men to the Hollywood Mall in Los Angeles, their unusual arrival was noticed by Jubilee, an orphaned teenage mallrat, who happened to be a mutant herself. Admiring the four beautiful ladies, Jubilee secretly followed them the entire day and was eventually rescued by them from a bunch of mutant hunters. When Gateway transported the X-women back to Australia, he deliberately left his portal open longer than necessary. Jubilee saw this and jumped through after them, finding herself welcomed by the old Aborigine. He then pointed her to a secret hide-out underneath the Reavers’ base and for some time Jubilee lived right under the X-Men’s noses without them noticing.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Reavers – now led by Donald Pierce – returned to reclaim their base. They made their move when the X-Men were away on a mission, but Gateway managed to contact Psylocke nonetheless. Through Dreamtime, Gateway sent the telepathic X-Man a precognitive vision, alerting her of the cruel fate the Reavers had in store for them. Psylocke took the warning seriously and, by the time Gateway teleported the X-Men back to Outback, she convinced the other X-Men to step through the Siege Perilous, a magical crystal portal that was to send them to a new life. Though robbed of their revenge, the Reavers still captured the unsuspecting Wolverine when he returned from a short leave of absence a few days later. They tortured him for days, with Gateway unable to help him, as he was once again forced to obey the Reavers. However, Wolverine managed to escape with the help of Jubilee, revealing in the process that he deliberately arranged for Jubilee to be around for this very purpose.\n\nMore recently, he appears at the Xavier Institute in Massachusetts, where Generation X is training, with a young girl. When he encounters Banshee, he simply speaks the word, \"Penance\", which is assumed to be the girl's name. Gateway would continue to appear sporadically around Generation X for some time, often in the presence of the fused St. Croix twins Nicole and Claudette, with whom he apparently had a teacher-student relationship.\n\nGateway appears briefly to Storm's X-Treme X-Men team, shortly after the death of Psylocke, and reveals that he is the ancestor of Bishop and Shard.\n\nHe is one of the mutants to have retained his powers after the M-Day.\n\nIt is revealed to Iceman and Cannonball that Gateway was one of the targeted mutants the Marauders were killing, along with Cable, Vargas and The Witness due to his powers giving him the ability to see into the future. The Marauders are later seen reporting to Mister Sinister to have killed Gateway, the Witness and Vargas. Gateway survives the assassination attempt and becomes the teacher of Eden Fesi, a young man with the power to manipulate reality.\n\nIn Uncanny X-Force #27, Fantomex is murdered by Skinless Man and this severs the connection between him and Ultimaton, the guardian Weapon XV who watched over The World and helped raise Evan. Ultimaton returns to his basic sentinel programming to kill all mutants and snaps Gateway's neck before exploding into a nuclear inferno, destroying Cavern X. Psylocke is able to use her telepathic powers to allow Gateway to create one last portal before dying and save the X-Force.\n\nGateway is seen as one of the many resurrected mutants now residing on the island nation of Krakoa.\n\nGateway is a mutant with teleportation and psychic abilities.\n\nGateway creates wormholes which allow travel through space, time and dimensions. He opens these gateways by whirling his bullroarer over his head. The gateways can be used for both observation and transport. No limits have been shown to Gateway's teleportational range or the mass he can transport. He has, for example, transported the X-Men from Australia to the United States and back using his powers, as well as transporting them trans-dimensionally to another Earth. He also opened up gateways to the past.\n\nGateway is additionally able to enter people's dreams. There he can directly interact with the elements of the dream, and even pull other people into the dream.\n\nGateway also possesses psionic abilities that allow him to communicate with telepaths. Gateway once spoke to the telepathic Generation X member Chamber psionically, as well as regularly communicating psionically with the St. Croix twins, then disguised as their older sister M.\n\nIt has also been implied that he possesses total recall or eidetic memory, as it was revealed in the alternate timeline of the Age of Apocalypse that his time-space manipulating powers allow him to be virtually omniscient, as he is described as \"the repository of the knowledge of humanity, the living index of every hard earned scrap of information gleaned in our ascent from mindless savagery\".\n\nIn the Age of Apocalypse, Gateway spends most of his time on Wundagore Mountain, trying to physically absorb any and all knowledge in audio-visual format from hundreds of televisions and computers using his powers to slow time and warp space before the forces of Apocalypse destroy everything. Weapon X travels to Gateway's home to recruit him in the effort to deliver a crushing blow to Apocalypse's North American forces. Gateway, who is very talkative in this reality, agrees to listen after his bodyguard, Carol Danvers, sacrifices herself in a battle against Donald Pierce. Gateway finally agrees to lead the attack force when he is confronted with the holographic image of a dying sixteen-year-old victim of one of Apocalypse's Infinites. He was later captured and imprisoned in the mysterious floating city known only as The Sky. Gateway was eventually rescued by the combined efforts of the Amazing X-Men and the Uncanny X-Force team but is later reported by the AoA version of William Stryker to have been killed in action.\n\nIn the \"House of M\" universe, Gateway is briefly seen helping Magneto and his followers overthrow Genosha's current rulers by teleporting his forces to the country.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1911188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911188", "title": "Appalachian School of Law", "text": "Appalachian School of Law\n\nThe Appalachian School of Law (ASL) is an ABA-approved private law school on a four building campus in Grundy, Virginia, a small town near the convergence of Virginia, Kentucky, and West Virginia. The school offers a three-year Juris Doctor degree, and enrolls approximately 128 full-time students. The law school was founded in 1994 and admitted its first class of students in August 1997. ASL was started and brought to Buchanan County, Virginia as a tool of economic development for the region. ASL is notable for its focus to community service and leadership, emphasizing professional responsibility and alternative dispute resolution in its curriculum and requiring students to complete 25 hours of community service per semester in order to graduate. Each student is also required to complete an externship before graduation. According to ASL's 2018 ABA-required disclosures, 55% of the Class of 2017 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. ASL was also the site of a triple homicide that took place on January 16, 2002.\n\nASL traces its roots back to 1993 when Norton, Virginia lawyer Joe Wolfe came up with the idea to create a law school in Central Appalachia. His idea was well received by local business leaders and a steering committee was founded in 1994 and grew to eighty members. The committee surveyed lawyers and found that legal education needed to emphasize professional responsibility and alternative dispute resolution as these pillars of law school were becoming more important in today's law practice. The committee gained permission from the Virginia General Assembly to start a law school in 1995 and continued to secure endorsements from local civic associations and industrial development authorities. Buchanan County, Virginia approached the committee in 1996 and offered the grounds and buildings of the former P.V. Dennis Elementary and Grundy Jr. High Schools to which the steering committee accepted.\n\nA $1 million loan (which was later converted into a grant) financed the buildings' renovations.\n\nThe State Council of Higher Education in Virginia granted the school the ability to enroll students studying for the Juris Doctor Degree in 1997. The charter class of 71 students first attended classes on August 12, 1997.\n\nBuchanan County brought ASL to Grundy in order to revitalize a town that had been in a steady economic decline since the town's Flood of 1977. ASL has brought a positive economic impact on its home town, including spurring construction of rental homes and the opening of additional businesses in the area. ASL has become a success story for the concept of higher education as an economic development tool. The school has brought in $12 million per year to the local economy. ASL's economic success spurred the conception and implementation of the Appalachian College of Pharmacy (formerly University of Appalachia College of Pharmacy), which was founded in 2003 and opened its doors in 2005.\n\nOn January 16, 2002, ASL Dean Anthony Sutin, Professor Thomas Blackwell, and first-year student Angela Dales were shot and killed by disgruntled student Peter Odighizuwa, 43, of Nigeria. When Odighizuwa exited the building, he was subdued by two students armed with personal firearms. At his trial, Odighizuwa was found mentally competent, pleaded guilty to the murders to avoid the death penalty, and was sentenced to multiple life terms in prison.\n\nThe total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at ASL for the 2017-2018 academic year is $50,400.\n\nAccording to ASL's official 2018 ABA-required disclosures, 55% of the Class of 2017 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation.\nAccording to the schools' required disclosures, ASL's student body demographic was as follows: 73% White, 16% African American, 5% Hispanic, 3% Asian American, 2% Native American, with the remainder unknown or not reporting. The student to full-time faculty ratio in 2017 was 12.8 to 1. For the fall 2016 entering class, 452 applied for admission, of which 296 (66%) were granted admission and 68 (23% of those accepted) matriculated into the first year class. The 25-75 percentile range for LSAT scores and undergraduate GPA is 141-149 and 2.51-3.17. In 2018, 44% of Appalachian graduates taking the Virginia bar for the first time passed, vs. an 80% average rate.\n\nThe student body size declined from 332 total students in 2011 to 96 in 2016, before rebounding slightly to 128 in 2017.\n\nAppalachian School of Law was granted full accreditation by the American Bar Association on June 12, 2006, and at the ABA meeting of February 20-22, 2020 the Council of the Section on Legal Accreditation removed the provisional accreditation discussed below, finding it has demonstrated compliance with accreditation standards. The school had been provisionally accredited by the ABA since February 2001, so students completing their course of legal study at this approved law school could take the bar examination in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nIn 2017, Appalachian School of Law was one of several law schools sanctioned by the American Bar Association due to lax admissions standards and other defects.\n\nThe ASL campus consists of three buildings, the main academic building, the Booth Center and the law library. The law school also uses the Booth Hall reception room as a classroom, as the Southwest Virginia Community College occupies all the classrooms.\n\nThe main academic building was created from the town's former high school (and junior high school) and gymnasium complex; these buildings were joined and extensively remodeled and expanded as part of a $1 million award-winning architectural project. The main building contains an appellate courtroom (which doubles as the auditorium for large events), a trial courtroom, five seminar rooms, student mailroom, the Lion's Lounge, and faculty and staff offices. Most rooms are wired for internet access.\nThe two-story law library is adjacent to the main building. The building has and has facilities for seminar classes and group study rooms. The library contains almost 227,000 volumes. Once the former Grundy Elementary School, this building has also been extensively remodeled and features individual and group study areas, a computer lab, and both wireless and wired internet access.\n\nA third campus building, Booth Hall, has recently opened. Booth Hall is situated behind and to the rear of the main academic building and law library. The building will have of space on three floors. Thirty three parking spaces will be situated on the first floor. Additional classrooms, including one that seats 150 students, computer lab, student lounges, and a conference room will be included in the new building. The building is estimated to be completed in 2008 and will house the school's Business Office and President's Office. The building will also house facilities for Southwest Virginia Community College, which will share classroom space with ASL.\n\nStudents at Appalachian complete the traditional law school curriculum as required by the American Bar Association (ABA); however, the school distinguishes itself from almost all of the other 192 ABA accredited law schools in the country, as its students are required to spend 25 hours each semester on community service projects, ranging from dispute resolution training to humane society management. Only 11 other law schools have similar mandatory programs.\n\nASL offers a Pre-Admission Summer Opportunity (PASO) programs for students who have the potential to become good lawyers and law students but whose LSAT's and GPA's do not necessarily reflect their skills and talents. The program lasts four weeks, three of which are independent home study, the final week is the on-campus lecture and final exam. The top scorers on the final exam may be offered admission to the fall's first year class.\n\nFirst year students arrive one week before the academic year starts to partake in a one credit course called Introduction to Law which covers the basic skills needed in order to succeed in law school. Students also register for classes and finalize their financial aid needs then.\n\nFirst year students cover legal foundation courses: Torts (4 credits), Contracts (6 credits), Property (6 credits), Civil Procedure (5 credits), Criminal Law (3 credits) and Legal Process (6 credits). Legal Process teaches students legal research and writing. First-year students also take an orientation course to the community service program in the first semester and an additional legal research course in the second semester. First-year students may not take any electives.\nAdditionally, all first-year students are required to complete a 200-hour unpaid externship over the summer before their second-year. This requirement is usually met by students working as judicial clerks, interns in prosecutor and defense offices, state and federal governmental agencies, and private practices. Placements have included state supreme courts, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States Department of Justice. The school provides assistance in locating and obtaining these positions.\nSecond year students cover additional legal foundation courses: Constitutional Law (6 credits), Evidence (4 credits), Professional Responsibility (3 credits), and Criminal Procedure (3 credits). Students also cover Trusts and Estates (4 credits) and Business Associations (4 credits), and are allowed to take electives, such as Appellate Advocacy. Students also fulfill their alternative dispute resolution requirement in the second year.\n\nStudents in their third year have the most options when it comes to electives. Third year students are required to take Family Law (3 credits), Secured transactions (3 credits), Payment Systems (3 credits), and a Practicum (4 credits), which include: Trial Advocacy, Criminal Practice, Estate Planning, Pre-Trial Practice, Real Estate Transactions, Insurance Law, or Employment Law. Additionally, students have their experience in a writing-intensive seminar. Each student takes two practicums focusing on the practical aspects of legal practice.\n\nASL is distinguished by its requirement that all second-year students complete a mandatory Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) class. The school has also held ADR training in local schools; this program drew national attention, particularly from former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, who has publicly congratulated the school on this effort. Students are given an overview of different types of conflict resolutions, particularly mediation, negotiation, and arbitration. Ethical issues are explored in addition to legal and policy ramifications. Students learn the strengths and weaknesses of each method of dispute resolution and learn which methods are appropriate for certain situations.\nStudents also have the option of taking additional courses in their second and third years to earn certification for mediation under the \"Lawyer as a Problem Solver\" Certificate Program. Students must complete basic law school procedure courses, two ADR focused courses, and an additional problem solving skills course. ASL offers two courses to fulfill this requirement: certified civil mediation, and advanced negotiation. The school has two faculty members who solely teach alternative dispute resolution related courses.\n\nASL has an active student body involved in activities not only on campus but within the local community and the legal profession as well. \n\nOfficially recognized student organizations on campus:\nASL's student body governs itself through the Student Bar Association. The SBA is divided into three branches, the Senate, Executive, and the Honor Court. The Senate consists of three elected senators for the first year, second year, and third year classes. The Executive Branch consists of the Student Body President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer, plus any committees that the President appoints to assist in his or her endeavors. The Honor Court consists of five elected judges, one for the first year class and two per upper class.\n\nASL also fields moot court teams that compete in national competitions. Students can audition for the team through an annual intra-school tournament that is composed of the Appellate Advocacy class in fall of the second year.\n"}
{"id": "1911192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911192", "title": "Indie game development", "text": "Indie game development\n\nIndependent video game development, or indie game development, is the video game development process of creating indie games; these are video games, commonly created by individual or small teams of video game developers and usually without significant financial support of a video game publisher or other outside source. These games may take years to be built from the ground up or can be completed in a matter of days or even hours depending on complexity, participants, and design goal.\n\nDriven by digital distribution, the concept of independent video game development has spawned an \"indie\" movement. The increase in popularity of independent games has allowed increased distribution on popular gaming platforms such as the PlayStation Network, Nintendo eShop, Xbox Live and Steam.\n\nThe origins of indie video games may be traced back to the 1970s, when there was virtually no established video game industry. Joyce Weisbecker considers herself the first indie designer, having created several games for the RCA Studio II console in 1976 as an independent contractor for RCA. As video game firms developed they employed more programmers. Nonetheless, independent programmers continued to make their own games. During the 1990s, indie games were most commonly distributed as shareware or shared from friend to friend and therefore known as \"shareware games\".\n\nAs the industry grew during the 1980s, publishing a game became more difficult. Chris Crawford said in late 1984,\n\nBefore the mid-1990s, commercial game distribution was controlled by big publishers and retailers, and developers of indie games were forced to either build their own publishing company, find one willing to distribute their game, or distribute it in some form of shareware (e.g. through BBSs). The increased production costs at the beginning of the 2000s made the video game publishers even more risk averse and let them reject all small-size and too innovative concepts of small game developers.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, some indie (computer) game developers had taken the opportunity to make their games open source, thus rendering the group of possible participants much larger depending on the interest a project generates. Other developers decided to make their games open source on end of commercialization phase to prevent their work from becoming abandonware. This approach allows the game community also to port the game to new platforms and to provide software support (community patches) by themselves, when the developer ends the official support. Several online communities have formed around independent game development, like TIGSource, Ludum Dare, and the indiegames.comblog.\n\nThe digital distribution available since the 2000s offers new possibilities for the whole video game industry, especially for independent video game developers who can now bypass the big publisher for game distribution. Gabe Newell, creator of the PC digital distribution service Steam, formulated the advantages over physical retail distribution for smaller game developers as:\n\nThe creator of Oddworld, Lorne Lanning, expressed his desire to only make games independently instead of going through publishers. “I’d rather not make games than ... be a slave for public companies who care more about their shareholders than they do about their customers.\"\n\nWith the rise of online shopping and digital distribution like through the Steam platform, gog.com, and the Humble Store, it has become possible to sell indie games to a worldwide market with little or no initial investment by using services such as XBLA, the PlayStation Network or PayPal.\n\nAlso since the 2000s, the new trend of crowdfunding platforms (like Kickstarter or Indiegogo) allows smaller developers to fund their work directly by their fans and customers, bypassing traditional and problematic financing methods.\n\nThe best-selling video game \"Minecraft\" began life as an indie game, prior to its acquisition by Microsoft in 2014.\nLeading into 2015, there was concern that the rise of easy-to-use tools to create and distribute video games could lead to an oversupply of video games; this was termed the indiepocalypse. This perception of an indiepocalypse is not unanimous; Jeff Vogel stated in a talk at GDC 2016 that any downturn was just part of the standard business cycle. The size of the indie game market was estimated in March 2016 to be at least $1 billion per year for just those games offered through Steam. Mike Wilson, Graeme Struthers and Harry Miller, the co-founders of indie publisher Devolver Digital, stated in April 2016 that the market in indie games is more competitive than ever but continues to appear healthy with no signs of faltering. \"Gamasutra\" said that by the end of 2016, while there had not be any type of catastrophic collapse of the indie game market, there were signs that the growth of the market had significantly slowed and that it has entered a \"post-indiepocalypse\" phase as business models related to indie games adjust to these new market conditions.\n\nThe definition of what qualifies for independent video game development is vague. The term itself bore out from the independent music arena, where \"indie\" refers to publishing music without using a major record label, such as using smaller independent labels or via self-publishing. One simple definition, described by Laura Parker for GameSpot, says \"independent video game development is the business of making games without the support of publishers\". However, this independent nature can be seen described from two broad directions.\n\nThe term \"indie development\" has been broadly applied to small development teams, realizing small and non-traditional non-AAA game titles on small budgets without financial help of a larger publisher. Some notable instances of games that are generally considered \"indie\" but challenge this definition include:\n\nGames that are not as large as most triple-A games, but are developed by larger independent studios with or without publisher backing and that can apply triple-A design principles and polish due to the experience of the team, have sometimes been called \"triple-I\" games, reflecting the middle ground between these extremes.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the common medium was cassette tape, which was the default software format for systems such as the ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore 64. This eventually gave way to floppy disk and then to CD-ROM in the 1990s.\n\nRecently independent games have been released for big budget consoles like Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii. Many games that are being released for these consoles are ports of popular flash games and/or just plainly developed independent games that have received notice. Often indie games are completely programmer driven, due to lack of publisher funding for artwork.\n\nOn November 19, 2008, Microsoft launched \"Xbox LIVE Community Games\", later renamed as \"Xbox Live Indie Games\", which allowed independent developers to create games for the Xbox 360 using XNA development tools and sell them in an area of the Xbox Live Marketplace.\n\nIn May 2010, several independent developers organized the Humble Indie Bundle, which raised over $1.25 million in revenue (of which about $400,000 went to charity) and showed the value that community involvement and cross-platform development can have for independent developers.\n\nThe majority of the distribution of PC and Mac games comes via portals of digital distributors such as Steam, GOG.com, Desura and several others.\n\nWith the advent of smartphones such as the iPhone and the relative ease of producing these titles many independent game developers solely develop games for various smart phone operating systems such as the iOS and the newer Android. This has also seen games being ported across to take advantage of this new revenue stream such as the successful game Minecraft.\n\nThere are also independent games distribution websites, such as IndieCity, springing up to cater exclusively for indie games, rather than including them alongside the mainstream games which are the main focus of most distribution portals (see: Desura, gog.com, Humble Store, Steam). Before the launch of the PlayStation 4 Sony made it a priority to focus on getting independent developers to create new games for the PlayStation 4.\n\nPersonal computer platforms (with OSes such as Windows, Linux, macOS) are traditionally more accessible (\"open platform\") to independent game developers than video game consoles (\"closed platform\"). Similarly, developing for mobile platforms is often accessible or becoming more accessible. For example, Apple's iOS platform has been historically inaccessible, but has become more open with many games submitted, such as with the launch of an \"indie\" store section.\n\nConsole manufacturers often impose a strict approval process and can outright reject approval (closed platform). Also, game developers are required to pay fees to license the required Software Development Kits (SDKs). An example is independent developer Wisdom Tree, who created video games (\"Bible Adventures\" etc.) for the NES console in the late 1980s. Another example where the rejection of an SDK license prevented access to a platform is the case of Robert Pelloni and his game \"Bob's game\" in 2008. To develop for Nintendo Wii, Xbox 360, or PlayStation 3 requires an SDK license fee of between US$2,000 and $10,000. The console maker also takes a percentage of the game's net profit, in addition to yearly developer fees.\n\nThere is also movement from some manufacturers to lower the threshold for indies; for instance, development for Xbox Live Indie Games only requires a $99/year Creators Club membership and Microsoft takes 30% of sales. Microsoft does provide a free membership to the Creators Club to students via the DreamSpark program. Indie game developers can also use homebrew development libraries, which are free of charge, and usually open source.\n\n"}

It forms part of a standard weather station and holds instruments that may include thermometers (ordinary, maximum/minimum), a hygrometer, a psychrometer, a dewcell, a barometer, and a thermograph.\n\nStevenson screens may also be known as a cotton region shelter, an instrument shelter, a thermometer shelter, a thermoscreen, or a thermometer screen. Its purpose is to provide a standardised environment in which to measure temperature, humidity, dewpoint, and atmospheric pressure. It is white in color to reflect direct solar radiation. The common type of Stevenson screen has a maximum and minimum thermometer for daily readings.\n\nIt was designed by Thomas Stevenson (1818–1887), a Scottish civil engineer who designed many lighthouses, and was the father of author Robert Louis Stevenson. The development of his small thermometer screen with double-louvered walls on all sides and no floor was reported in 1864. After comparisons with other screens in the United Kingdom, Stevenson's original design was modified.\n\nThe modifications by Edward Mawley of the Royal Meteorological Society in 1884 included a double roof, a floor with slanted boards, and a modification of the double louvers. This design was adopted by the British Meteorological Office and eventually other national services, such as Canada. The national services developed their own variations, such as the single-louvered Cotton Region design in the United States.\n\nThe traditional Stevenson screen is a box shape, constructed of wood, in a double-louvered design. However, it is possible to construct a screen using other materials and shapes, such as a pyramid. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) agreed standard for the height of the thermometers is between and above the ground.\n\nThe interior size of the screen will depend on the number of instruments that are to be used. A single screen may measure and a double screen . The unit is either supported by four metal or wooden legs or a wooden post.\n\nThe top of the screen was originally composed of two asbestos boards with an air space between them. These asbestos boards have generally been replaced by a laminate for health and safety reasons. The whole screen is painted with several coats of white to reflect sunlight radiation, and usually requires repainting every two years.\n\nThe siting of the screen is very important to avoid data degradation by the effects of ground cover, buildings and trees: WMO 2010 recommendations, if incomplete, are a sound basis. In addition, Environment Canada, for example, recommends that the screen be placed at least twice the distance of the height of the object, \"e.g.\", from any tree that is high.\n\nIn the northern hemisphere, the door of the screen should always face north so as to prevent direct sunlight on the thermometers. In polar regions with twenty-four-hour sunlight, the observer must take care to shield the thermometers from the sun and at the same time avoiding a rise in temperature being caused by the observer's body heat.\n\nA special type of Stevenson screen with an eye bolt on the roof is used on a ship. The unit is hung from above and remains vertical despite the movement of the vessel.\n\nIn some areas the use of single-unit automatic weather stations is supplanting the Stevenson screen and other standalone meteorological equipment.\n\n"}

The town is centred on the point where the R125 and R155 regional roads meet. The Broad Meadow River () flows through the town. As of the 2016 census, there were 9,533 people living in Ratoath.\n\nRatoath gives its name to a village, a townland, a parish, an electoral division and to a barony. The derivation or meaning of the word is uncertain. Two alternative Irish forms are cited: \"Ráth-Tógh\" and \"Ráth-Tábhachta\". These place names occur in Irish manuscripts and scholars say that the writers were referring to Ratoath. Evidently they were trying to give a phonetic rendering of a name that was unfamiliar to them. \"Mruigtuaithe\" occurs in the Book of Armagh as the name of one of these places in Meath where Saint Patrick founded a church and Eoin MacNeill identifies it as Ratoath. If this is correct it would seem that the second portion of the word comes from the Irish word \"tuath\" which means a territory belonging to a family or sept. \"Mruig\" means a grazing plain. \"Ráth\" is the Irish for a ringfort. In a royal grant of the manor of Ratoath to Sir Robert Bold in 1468 it was described as \"Rathonth\".\n\nRatoath has its own secondary school known as Ratoath College.\n\nRatoath has a number pubs, shops, restaurants, and takeaways such as Ryans pub, Centra and Thai Yummy.\n\nIn the 20 years between the 1996 and 2016 census, the population of Ratoath increased nearly 10-fold, from 1,061 in 1996 to 9,533 by 2016. According to the 2016 census report, 87% of the town's houses (2,437 of 2,790 households) were constructed between 1991 and 2010.\n\nRatoath is a commuter town with most of its adult population commuting to Dublin to work. More than three quarters of the population travel to work by car. In 2011, 10.9% of the workforce was unemployed compared to the national average of 19%. As of 2011, social class A, employers and managers constituted 717 of the 2,751 households. \n\nIn April 2011 Ratoath had a population of 9,043, consisting of 4,520 males and 4,523 females. The population of pre-school age (0–4) was 1,158, of primary school going age (5–12) was 1,582 and of secondary school going age (13–18) was 724. There were 313 persons aged 65 years and over. The number of persons aged 18 years or over was 5,677. Non-Irish nationals accounted for 9.7 per cent of the population of Ratoath in 2011 compared with a national average figure of 12.0 per cent. UK nationals (168 persons) were the largest group, followed by Lithuanians (120 persons). 3,676 persons could speak the Irish language and of these 1,702 spoke the language daily. 1,025 persons spoke a language other than Irish or English at home and of these 137 could not speak English well or at all. French was the most common foreign language spoken at home with 131 speakers. There were 7,843 Roman Catholics in the area at census time. A further 649 were adherents of other stated religions, while 420 persons indicated that they had no religion.\n\nJust outside the town is the horse racing track Fairyhouse racecourse, where the Irish Grand National is held. Ratoath has a long history with horse racing, with many jockeys coming from the area. These include Keith Flood, the founder of Fairyhouse racecourse, and holder of the record for the most Grade 1 wins in Ireland and the UK.\n\nIn 2016, for the first time in their history, Ratoath GAA hurlers got into a Leinster final after they defeated Rosenallis. \n\n"}

The headteacher is Mr Mark Tilling.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2005-2006 school year, the school was designated a specialist Science College with a secondary specialism of Maths.\n\nHigh Tunstall School consists of five main blocks (\nA-B-C-D-E). Block A is used for cooking, block B is used for maths and science, block C is for citizenship, philosophy, ethics, history, geography and English . Block D is for arts and languages and block E is for world affairs. Block A is also used for administration. Two blocks are almost completely for teaching and another isolated block exists as a combination for the two. There is also one temporary block, which is used exclusively for teaching.

{"id": "1911259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911259", "title": "The Hold Steady", "text": "The Hold Steady\n\nThe Hold Steady is an American rock band from Brooklyn, New York, formed in 2003. The band consists of Craig Finn (vocals, guitar), Tad Kubler (guitar), Galen Polivka (bass), Bobby Drake (drums), Franz Nicolay (keyboards) and Steve Selvidge (guitar). Noted for their \"lyrically dense storytelling,\" and classic rock influences, the band's narrative-based songs frequently address themes such as drug addiction, religion and redemption, and often feature recurring characters based within the city of Minneapolis.\n\nFormed four years following the break-up of Finn and Kubler's former band, Lifter Puller, The Hold Steady released the debut album \"Almost Killed Me\" in 2004. They came to prominence with the release of their third studio album, \"Boys and Girls in America\", in 2006. In 2010, keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist Franz Nicolay left the band prior to the recording of their fifth studio album, \"Heaven Is Whenever\" (2010). During the band's subsequent tour, the band became a five piece, once more, with the addition of guitarist Steve Selvidge. The band released their sixth LP, \"Teeth Dreams\", on March 25, 2014. \n\nNicolay re-joined the band on May 4, 2016, and the band has since embarked on several concert residencies in the US and the UK. To coincide with each new event, The Hold Steady releases stand-alone singles, marking the first recorded material of the six-piece line-up. The band's seventh LP, \"Thrashing Thru the Passion\", was released in August 2019.\n\nIn 2003, Minnesota-raised singer, writer, and guitarist Craig Finn and New York City bartender and bassist Galen Polivka began talking about starting a band. Finn and lead guitarist Tad Kubler (both formerly of Lifter Puller) developed the idea of The Hold Steady when, while watching The Band concert film \"The Last Waltz\", Finn asked Kubler, \"Dude, why aren't there any bands like this anymore?\" The Hold Steady's 2004 debut album \"Almost Killed Me\", released on Frenchkiss Records, was a sleeper hit among music critics, reaching No. 31 in the \"Pazz & Jop\" critics poll that year, an achievement which Finn described as \"like being nominated for an Oscar or something.\" In May 2005, they were the first rock band to grace the front page of \"The Village Voice\" in 15 years . They were \"Blender\"'s 2006 \"Band of the Year\".\n\nThe band released its second album, \"Separation Sunday\", on May 3, 2005. The album was a loose concept album following the exploits of a character named \"Holly\" (short for \"Hallelujah\") and her quest to find a balance between Catholicism and rock and roll through drugs and a metaphorical resurrection. The album was critically lauded, and its religious overtones were picked up by many critics, such as Joe Gross of the \"Village Voice\", who dubbed it \"the most egregiously American Catholic album since X's \"Under the Big Black Sun\", Springsteen's \"Tunnel of Love\", or that Jewish new waver Billy Joel's \"The Stranger\".\"\n\nAfter \"Separation Sunday\", the band moved from the Frenchkiss Records imprint to Vagrant Records. Released October 3, 2006, \"Boys and Girls in America\" was ranked No. 8 on the \"Rolling Stone\" Best Albums of 2006 list, and first by The A.V. Club. Pitchfork Media's Scott Plagenhoff wrote of the album, \"<nowiki>[</nowiki>Craig Finn<nowiki>]</nowiki> not only has a commanding, rousing voice but he also says something worth hearing, displaying gifts for both scope and depth that are all too rare in contemporary rock — indie or mainstream.\" In 2006, they released a music video for \"Chips Ahoy\", directed by Moh Azima and starring Avital Ash. In 2007, the band recorded a modified version of \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\" to be played during the seventh-inning stretch at Minnesota Twins home games. They also contributed a cover of the Bob Dylan and The Hawks/The Band song \"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\" to the motion picture \"I'm Not There\".\n\nThe band's fourth album, \"Stay Positive\", was released in the UK on July 14, 2008 and in the U.S. on July 15. The album was recorded in Hoboken, New Jersey and Wild Arctic studio in Queens, New York with producer John Agnello during January and February that year. Guests on the sessions included Ben Nichols from Lucero, J. Mascis of Dinosaur Jr., Emilyn Brodsky, and Doug Gillard, who played guitar in Guided By Voices. Finn has said that he believes the album \"captures a band hitting their creative peak, as well as enjoying each other's creativity and company.\" The album is more expansive than previous releases, including talk-box solos, harpsichord, and tuneful vocals (the notoriously gruff-voiced Finn started taking voice lessons). \"There are some bands that do five records that all sound similar,\" says guitarist Tad Kubler. \"We've tried to avoid that.\" Many familiar elements – sing-along choruses, extended piano and guitar solos and lyrics that deal with faith, crime, rumor, loss and love – remain.\n\nIn April 2009, the band released a two-disc documentary and live album set entitled \"A Positive Rage\".\n\nOn January 20, 2010, Franz Nicolay confirmed on his official website that he had left the band. Regarding his departure, vocalist and guitarist Craig Finn stated: \"Franz is a real ambitious guy, and I think he wanted to do a lot of different things, and we want to really follow this one Hold Steady thing to its logical end. And it takes up a lot of time. It was an amicable departure, and I think we all wish him the best. He’ll do a lot of interesting, cool things.\"\n\nNicolay had said that he considered his work with the Hold Steady to be completed, saying \"I’m proud of the work we did together. In the end, I felt I completed the work I needed to do with them. I’d prefer to think of it as a closed book.\"\n\nThe Hold Steady announced the release of \"Heaven Is Whenever\" on Feb. 23, 2010. The album was released May 4 on Vagrant Records in the U.S. and May 3 on Rough Trade in Europe.\n\nThe band's subsequent tour featured additional musicians Steve Selvidge, formerly of Big Ass Truck and Lucero, on guitar and Dan Neustadt, of In Cadeo and The World/Inferno Friendship Society. Neustadt had previously played keyboards on \"Heaven is Whenever\", but eventually left the touring band by 2011.\n\nIn 2011, Selvidge was added to the band's official line-up, with Craig Finn stating, \"We added [Steve Selvidge], we are a five piece. We are rolling without keys right now. We did some shows without keys and we really liked it. It sort of opened things up for us. We have two pretty amazing guitar players in our band, and it's really fun to have that space and spread out. They can sort of work against each other/with each other. Steve's been a great addition to the band. We came across Steve many years ago and we always kind of said, 'Man, if things open up and we can get him in the band, we want him.' [...] Steve, lives in Memphis. So wherever we record this time, someone's not going to be at home.\"\n\nIn July 2011, during a five-month break from the band, Craig Finn recorded a solo album, entitled \"Clear Heart Full Eyes\", which was subsequently released in January 2012.\n\nThe band recorded a track for the \"Game of Thrones\" episode \"Walk of Punishment\", entitled \"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\", and released it, alongside a new track, \"Criminal Fingers\", for Record Store Day 2013. Regarding the release, guitarist Tad Kubler stated, \"Steve [Selvidge] – our guitar player wasn’t in the band when we did the last record so we haven’t formally released anything that he’s played on – other than an iTunes session or something like that. Having been away for a few years, we thought this would be a great opportunity to reintroduce the newest version of the band.\"\n\nOn January 8, 2014, The Hold Steady announced the release of their sixth LP entitled \"Teeth Dreams\". The album was released on March 25 via Washington Square, a new imprint of record label Razor & Tie. In addition, the band announced the release of a covers EP entitled \"RAGS\", whose proceeds go towards the K + L Guardian Foundation to benefit the children of deceased super fan Mike \"Jersey Mike\" Van Jura.\n\nIn 2016, Nicolay rejoined the band, expanding its lineup to a six-piece. The band soon began performing three-night residencies in specific cities, as opposed to embarking on full tours. In 2016, they performed residencies in Chicago and Brooklyn, and returned to both the following year for the named events, \"Chicago Seemed Wired Last Night\" and \"Massive Nights\", before performing over three nights in London for \"Boys & Girls in London\" in 2018.\n\nIn late 2017, to coincide with the band's 2017 \"Massive Nights\" residency, the band released two new songs, \"Entitlement Crew\" and \"Snake in the Shower\", with two further tracks, \"Eureka\" and \"Esther\", from the same recording sessions accompanying \"Boys & Girls in London\". The recordings are the first to feature the full six-person Hold Steady line-up.\n\nOn March 4, 2019 the band released their first song of 2019; \"The Last Time She Talked To Me\".\n\nOn June 18, 2019 the band announced their seventh album, \"Thrashing Thru the Passion\". The album was released on August 16, 2019 via Frenchkiss Records.\n\nIn an interview with Pitchfork Media, Craig Finn outlined the band's influences:\nThe Hold Steady have received almost universal praise by the press for their performances and early records. Their more recent releases have seen a slight decline in their reception.\nThe Hold Steady appeared in the Season 3 Finale episode of Showtime's Billions series as themselves performing at a party for Axe Capital.\n\nThe Hold Steady has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\" according to journalist Steve Marsh. Kubler and Finn's previous group Lifter Puller also has a star.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1911266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911266", "title": "Catullus 2", "text": "Catullus 2\n\nCatullus 2 is a poem by Roman poet Gaius Valerius Catullus (\"c\". 84 – \"c\". 54 BCE) that describes the affectionate relationship between an unnamed \"puella\" (possibly Catullus' lover, Lesbia), and her pet sparrow. As scholar and poet John Swinnerton Phillimore has noted, \"The charm of this poem, blurred as it is by a corrupt manuscript tradition, has made it one of the most famous in Catullus' book.\" The meter of this poem is hendecasyllabic, a common form in Catullus' poetry.\n\nThis poem, together with Catullus' other poems, survived from antiquity in a single manuscript discovered \"c\". 1300 CE in Verona, from which three copies survive. Fourteen centuries of copying from copies — the \"corrupt manuscript tradition\" mentioned above — left scholars in doubt as to the poem's original wording in a few places, although centuries of scholarship have led to a consensus critical version. Research on Catullus was the first application of the genealogical method of textual criticism.\n\nLines 1-10 represent the preserved core of the poem. Lines 11-13 are denoted as \"Catullus 2b\" and differ significantly in tone and subject from the first 10 lines. Hence, these latter three lines may belong to a different poem. In the original manuscripts, these thirteen lines were combined with Catullus 3, which describes the death of Lesbia's sparrow, but the two poems were separated by scholars in the 16th century.\n\nThe following Latin text is taken from the 2003 critical edition of D. F. S. Thomson, with macrons added by Wikipedia.\n\nThe following lines 11-13 (Catullus 2b) refer to the Greek myth of Atalanta, a young princess who was remarkably swift of foot. To avoid marriage, she stipulated that she would marry only a man who could beat her in a footrace; suitors who failed to defeat her would be put to death. The hero Melanion (also known as Hippomenes) wooed Atalanta, who fell in love with him. During the race, Melanion threw a golden apple to distract her; stooping to pick it up, Atalanta lost the race, possibly deliberately so that she could marry him. The final line refers to undressing on the wedding night.\n\nCatullus was renowned for his meticulous care in crafting poems, even those with seemingly trifling content. Various artful devices are woven into the text of this poem, composed in hendecasyllabic verse. Lines 2-4 represent a tricolon crescens, in which the three relative clauses become gradually longer in length: \"quem ludere\", \"quem in sinu tenere\", and \"cui primum digitum dare appetenti et acris solet incitare morsus\". The repeated \"eee\" sounds (corresponding to the letter \"i\" in Latin) evoke the songbird's peeping (\"pipiabat\" in Catullus 3), e.g., (\"quicum ... in sinu ... cui primum ... appetenti ... acris ... nitenti ... iocari\"). \nThe \"a\" sounds may also convey images: the poet's sighs of longing; an \"ouch!\" at being bitten sharply (\"appetenti\", \"pecking\" and \"acris\", \"sharp\"); and a comforting sound (\"solaciolum\", \"small comfort\", and \"acquiescat\", \"calms\").\n\nThis poem and the following Catullus 3 (a lament for Lesbia's sparrow) inspired a genre of poems about lovers' pets. One classical example include Ovid's elegy on the death of his mistress Corinna's parrot (\"Amores\" 2.6.). Another is Martial's epigram (Book I number CIX) on a lap dog, which refers to Catullus 2 specifically (\"Issa est passere nequior Catulli\", \"Issa [the dog] is naughtier than Catullus's sparrow\").\n\nFollowing the printing of Catullus's works in 1472, Poems 2 and 3 gained new influence. From the earliest days after the re-discovery of Catullus' poems, some scholars have suggested that the bird was a phallic symbol, particularly if \"sinu\" in line 2 is translated as \"lap\" rather than \"bosom\". Other scholars, however, have rejected this suggestion.\n\nBirds were common love-gifts in the Classical world, and several scholars have speculated that the narrator gave it to the woman; this might explain the poet's identification with the sparrow and his fond lament for the bird in Catullus 3. The biting it does in line 4 ties in with Catullus 8, line 18 (\"cui labella mordebis\").\n\nA key question concerns the unity of this poem. In the copies derived from the original V manuscript, poems 2 (lines 1-10 below), 2b (lines 11-13 below), and Catullus 3 appear as one poem under the title \"Fletus passeris Lesbie\" (Lament for Lesbia's Sparrow). Shortly before 1500, Catullus 3 (the lament) was separated from Catullus 2/2b by Marcantonio Sabellico, which has been supported by scholars ever since.\n\nScholars have argued over whether the last three lines (2b) belong to a different poem, and whether words are missing between poems 2 and 2b. Scholars suggest that missing words (a \"lacuna\"), or a variant reading/rearrangement of the received text, would smooth the presently abrupt transition between lines 10 and 11. As noted above, there is some manuscript evidence for missing words after line 10. However, scholar S.J. Harrison, who believes the 13 lines are unified, has argued that \"there seems to be no vital gap in content which short lacuna would supply\" and if the missing words are many, then it is impossible to guess what they were and the poem must be accepted as simply broken into fragments.\n\nCatullus 2 and 2b differ significantly in their tone and subject. Catullus 2 is addressed directly to the bird (\"with you\") and describes its loving, playful relationship with the poet's girlfriend. By contrast, Catullus 2b mentions neither bird nor girlfriend, introducing a simile to the story of Atalanta, and seems to be written in the third person (\"it is as welcome to me\"), although some scholars have suggested that the text was corrupted from the second person (\"you are as welcome to me\"). The disjunction between Catullus 2 and 2b was first noted by Aquiles Estaço (Achilles Statius) in 1566; however, the first printed edition to show a lacuna between poems 2 and 2b (by the editor Karl Lachmann) appeared quite late, in 1829. Lachmann's separation of 2 and 2b has been followed by most subsequent editors.\n\n\n"}

An AWS will typically consist of a weather-proof enclosure containing the data logger, rechargeable battery, telemetry (optional) and the meteorological sensors with an attached solar panel or wind turbine and mounted upon a mast. The specific configuration may vary due to the purpose of the system. The system may report in near real time via the Argos System and the Global Telecommunications System, or save the data for later recovery. \n\nIn the past, automatic weather stations were often placed where electricity and communication lines were available. Nowadays, the solar panel, wind turbine and mobile phone technology have made it possible to have wireless stations that are not connected to the electrical grid or hardline telecommunications network.\n\nMost automatic weather stations have\n\nSome stations can also have\n\nUnlike manual weather stations, automated airport weather stations cannot report the class and amount of clouds. Also, precipitation measurements are difficult, especially for snow, as the gauge must empty itself between observations. For present weather, all phenomena that do not touch the sensor, such as fog patches, remain unobserved. The change from manual observations to automatic weather stations is a major non-climatic change in the climate record. The change in instrumentation, enclosure and location can lead to a jump in, for example, the measured temperature or precipitation values, which can lead to erroneous estimates of climate trends. This change, and related non-climatic changes, have to be removed by homogenization.\n\nThe data-logger is the heart of the Automatic Weather Station.\nIn high quality weather stations, the data-logger may be designed by the supplier to be the perfect solution for a particular meteorological client.\nIndeed, usually data-loggers found in the market don't fit the requirement in terms of power consumption, inputs, communication, protection against animals (ants, rats, etc.), humidity, salty air, sand, etc.\nThe main functions of a data-logger are:\n\nEnclosures used with automatic weather stations are typically weather proof fiberglass, ABS or stainless steel, With ABS being the cheapest, cast aluminium paint or stainless steel the most durable and fiberglass being a compromise.\n\nThe main power source for an automatic weather station depends on its usage. Many stations with lower power equipment usually use one or more solar panels connected in parallel with a regulator and one or more rechargeable batteries. As a rule of thumb, solar output is at its optimum for only 5 hours each day. As such, mounting angle and position are vital. In the Northern Hemisphere, the solar panel would be mounted facing south and vice versa for the Southern Hemisphere. The output from the solar panels may be supplemented by a wind turbine to provide power during periods of poor sunlight, or by direct connection to the local electrical grid. Most automated airport weather stations are connected to the commercial power grid due to the higher power needs of the ceilometer and present weather sensors, which are active sensors and emit energy directly into the environment.\n\nThe standard mast heights used with automatic weather stations are 2, 3, 10 and 30 meters. Other sizes are available, but typically these sizes have been used as standards for differing applications.\n\n"}

{"id": "1911306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1911306", "title": "Larne gun-running", "text": "Larne gun-running\n\nThe Larne gun-running was a major gun smuggling operation organised in April 1914 in Ireland by Major Frederick H. Crawford and Captain Wilfrid Spender for the Ulster Unionist Council to equip the Ulster Volunteer Force. The operation involved the smuggling of almost 25,000 rifles and between 3 and 5 million rounds of ammunition from the German Empire, with the shipments landing in Larne, Donaghadee, and Bangor in the early hours between Friday 24 and Saturday 25 April 1914. The Larne gun-running may have been the first time in history that motor-vehicles were used \"on a large scale for a military-purpose, and with striking success\".\n\nIn November 1910 the Ulster Unionist Council formed a secret committee to oversee the creation of a force in Ulster to fight against the imposition of Home Rule, which was proposed to give Ireland self-government within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Council approached Major Frederick H. Crawford to act as its agent to purchase the guns needed to equip such an organisation. Crawford wrote to five arms manufacturers, including the Austrian Steyr and the German Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken, seeking quotations for the purchase of 20,000 rifles and one million rounds of ammunition.\n\nIn January 1913, the Ulster Unionist Council instituted the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), consisting of men who had signed the Ulster Covenant. They wanted to co-ordinate the paramilitary activities of Ulster’s unionists, as well as to give military backing to the threats of the Ulster Covenant to resist implementation of the Third Home Rule Bill, which had been introduced on 11 April 1912 by Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. These threats had been regarded as a \"gigantic game of bluff and blackmail\" by Irish nationalist leader John Redmond as well as most Liberal MPs, including Winston Churchill. UVF membership grew to around 90,000 members, led by retired officers of the British Army, with the organisation under the charge of Lieutenant-General Sir George Richardson KCB, a veteran of the Afghan Wars. By 1913 the UVF had over £1 million pledged to it, and £70,000 invested in attempts to import arms.\n\nThroughout 1913 Major Crawford, with the use of aliases and disguises, had attempted to smuggle in arms bought in Great Britain and Imperial Germany, but vigilant customs officials had seized the goods at the docks. In one instance, patrol boats thwarted a gun-running attempt to Carrigart in northern County Donegal carried out by Lord Leitrim. Lord Leitrim had been carrying out a weekly small-scale gun-smuggling operation since February 1913, run by his chauffeur.\n\nIn early June 1913, around seven thousand rifles being stored by Crawford in a disused inn in Hammersmith were seized by police. The inn was being rented out to Crawford by a brother-in-law of staunch Unionist Sir William Bull, 1st Baronet. One week later, with the intention of forcing the government to accept that there was a real risk of armed resistance to Home Rule in Ulster., Crawford openly transported weapons to Belfast from several locations across England. These were intercepted by customs officials, \n\nMajor Crawford convinced the Ulster Unionist Council that he could provide the weapons and ammunition needed \"to equip the entire UVF\". In February 1914, when Crawford spoke with Edward Carson in London, Carson said \"I'll see you through this business even if I should go to prison for it. You are the bravest man I have ever met.\"\n\nCrawford secured the services of the \"SS Fanny\" to transport 216 tons of guns and ammunition which he had purchased from Benny Spiro, an arms dealer in Hamburg. Included in this cache was; 11,000 Mannlicher rifles brought from the Steyr works in Austria; 9,000 ex-German army Mausers; 4,600 Italian Vetterli-Vitali rifles; and 5 million rounds of ammunition in clips of five — much of which was transported from Hamburg via the Kiel Canal.\n\nOn 30 March 1914, these weapons were being loaded onto the \"SS Fanny\" on the Baltic island of Langeland when Danish customs officials seized the papers of the ship. The customs officials suspected that the cargo might contain weapons to arm militant Icelandic home rulers who sought independence from Denmark. The \"SS Fanny\" managed to escape into a gale and sailed outside Danish territorial waters. In covering the incident on 1 April, \"The Times\" newspaper predicted that the guns were destined for Ulster rather than Iceland.\n\nIn a bid to evade the authorities as the \"SS Fanny\" neared Ireland, Major Crawford purchased the \"SS Clyde Valley\" in Glasgow. On 19–20 April off Tuskar Rock, County Wexford, the entire cache of weapons was transferred from the \"SS Fanny\" onto the \"SS Clyde Valley\". On 24 April, the \"SS Clyde Valley\" was renamed the \"\"Mountjoy II\"\", with the use of strips of canvas painted with white letters on a black background. This referred to the \"Mountjoy\" that broke the boom across the River Foyle during the Siege of Derry in 1689, providing historic symbolism for unionists.\n\nIn Ulster, the UVF were given instructions for a full test-mobilisation. The UVF Motor Corps was summoned by the County Antrim commander, General Sir William Adair, and instructed as follows:\n\nThis was all part of a \"meticulous\" and \"elaborate\" plan to ensure that the operation succeeded; only 12 people knew the full details and reason for the mobilisation of the UVF members. This was officially only a \"test mobilisation\". Captain F. Hall, the military secretary to the UVF recorded details of these plans in a memorandum. These included tapping of the private telephone line connecting Hollywood Barracks to Exchange, as well as the short-circuiting of phone and telegraph wires into Larne after the last train, and the \"shorting\" of the main rail lines.\n\nOn the date of the landings, UVF members manned pickets and patrols along the length of the coast road between Belfast and Larne, as well as the roads leading to the towns of Ballyclare, Ballymena, and Glenarm amongst others. The men at these pickets were to give directions to any who needed them and were provided with reserve supplies of petrol and tools for repairing any vehicle that had problems. In Larne, UVF members wearing armlets stood \"in line silent as soldiers on parade\", and manned cordons that blocked the roads, preventing vehicles without a special permit from entering or departing Larne.\n\nCaptain James Craig took command of the operations in Bangor, with Adair taking command in Larne. Sir George Richardson, overall commander of the UVF, remained in Belfast on the night of the landings and was kept fully informed of proceedings by dispatch-riders.\n\nOn the date for the UVF Motor Corps \"test\" operation, a decoy ship, the tramp steamer \"SS Balmerino\", was dispatched into Belfast Lough as a decoy to attract attention from authorities, to investigate it for smuggled armaments, in what the UVF leadership called the \"Hoax\".\n\nIn addition, the UVF arranged for a large truck to be waiting at the Belfast docks as if for an incoming load. The captain of the \"SS Balmerino\" ensured that by making his ship's approach as suspicious as possible, the authorities would be alerted. Once the ship was docked, the captain set about stalling the authorities for as long as possible with excuses, and the authorities believed that they had intercepted the real cargo. Eventually the authorities searched the ship's contents, discovering its papers were in order and it was carrying only coal as described.\n\nWhilst this was happening, twenty miles away the \"\"Mountjoy II\"\" brought the real arms cache into Larne harbour unhindered. After the \"\"Mountjoy II\"\" docked, a motor-boat came alongside and cranes transferred \"thousands\" of rifles to it. After it had motored away, a second vessel came up to receive more arms. These vessels transported their loads to Donaghadee.\nThere the weapons were transferred to the motor vehicles; each batch was counted and its destination noted by counting clerks. Due to the volume of weapons, temporary arms-dumps had been set up in the surrounding districts so that the vehicles could return as quickly as possible to receive another load. \"The Belfast Evening Telegraph\" remarked that all present \"put their backs into it\" and that it \"illustrated the old adage, 'One Volunteer is worth three pressed men'\" and they \"toiled like galley slaves\". The local population of Larne were noted as having lined the streets exchanging salutes and running makeshift canteens to supply the workers with refreshments throughout the night.\n\nAt 5 am the \"Mountjoy\" set sail from Larne harbour for Bangor to unload the rest of its cargo. Three cheers for \"The King\" and three more for \"the Volunteers\" were let out by the ship's skipper and its crew as they stood to attention, with the cheers reportedly reciprocated by all those ashore.\n\nBy 8:30 am the \"\"Mountjoy II\"\" had completed its mission, and it set course for the River Clyde to confuse any coast-guards. On its way, crew cut away the canvas sheets bearing the name \"Mountjoy II,\" revealing the ship's real name, and it proceeded south along the Irish Sea. After offloading Major Crawford at Rosslare, County Wexford, the \"SS Clyde Valley\" set sail for the Baltic Sea, travelling along the coasts of France and Denmark. It rendezvoused with the \"SS Fanny\" to bring back the Ulstermen contingent of its crew. After that was done, the \"SS Fanny\" was disposed of at Hamburg.\n\nOne of the key figures in the operation was Captain Wilfrid Spender, a member of the UVF headquarters staff who is alleged to have been responsible for the entire scheme and helped in the \"Hoax\" masquerade. His wife recorded details of the landing in her diary for the dates 24–25 April:\n\"The Belfast Evening Telegraph\" reported on the events on April 25:\nFor the Unionist leaders, the Larne gun-running was even more of a political coup than a military feat. The Ulster Volunteers remained inadequately armed, as the weapons shipment contained three types of weapon and insufficient proper ammunition for them. Other historians consider that the Mauser 1898 model was advanced for its time, and the Larne delivery markedly increased the amount of arms for the UVF. Many much smaller weapons purchases had resulted in the UVF as having just over 37,000 rifles by June 1914.\n\nThe Larne gun-running put the gun back into Irish politics. The Irish Volunteers had been working on their own plan to acquire weapons, and the success at Larne heightened nationalist suspicions that the authorities were acquiescent towards unionist militants in Ulster. After the events in Larne, the nationalist Irish Volunteers, formed in late 1913, attracted many new members.\n\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, the government requested all arms and ammunition of the UVF for the war effort. By 1916 the ammunition had largely been transferred, but none of the rifles. In 1920 after the outbreak of the Irish war of Independence, the rifles were used to arm the new Ulster Special Constabulary that was formed (by the same Wilfrid Spender). The USC was largely recruited from former Ulster Volunteers. In 1940 the rifles were released to arm the British Home Guard after the Battle of France. They were first fired in action during the East African Campaign of 1940-41, arming the militias of Haile Selassie I.\n\nThe Irish Volunteers arranged their own Howth gun-running in July 1914, transporting the guns on a private yacht and unloading in daylight at the harbour, in front of a crowd. The Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP), aided by troops of the 2nd King's Own Scottish Borderers, tried unsuccessfully to confiscate the weapons. On their return to their barracks in Dublin, some troops baited by a hostile crowd, killed three people and wounded 38. A fourth man died later. Some nationalists interpreted the contrast between the inactivity of the police and military in Larne (which operation took place in the middle of the night) and the heavy-handed response in the middle of the day in Dublin that authorities were biased in favour of the UVF. The whole episode heightened tensions in Ireland, pulling it closer to the brink of civil war.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The kipunji has a unique call, described as a 'honk-bark', which distinguishes it from its close relatives, the grey-cheeked mangabey and the black crested mangabey, whose calls are described as 'whoop-gobbles'. Though it was originally thought to be a member of the\" Lophocebus\" genus genetic data later placed it as its own separate genus \"Rungwecebus\". The kipunji is the first new monkey genus to be discovered since Allen's swamp monkey in 1923.\n\nThe kipunji was independently discovered by researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society, the University of Georgia, and Conservation International, in December 2003 and July 2004, making it the first new African monkey species discovered since the sun-tailed monkey in 1984. Originally assigned to the genus \"Lophocebus\", genetic and morphological tests showed that it is more closely related to the baboons (genus \"Papio\") than to the other mangabeys in the genus \"Lophocebus\", and that \"Lophocebus\" was diphyletic, meaning that species with differing genealogies have been mistakenly lumped together. Scientists have assigned it to a new genus, Rungwecebus, named after Mount Rungwe, where it is found.\n\nZoologists were initially skeptical of the existence of the kipunji until its discovery, as traditional tales of the Nyakyusa people described the monkey as both real and mythical.\n\nAdult male kipunjis have been observed at an average length of 85 to 90 cm and are estimated to weigh between 10 and 16 kg. The kipunji's relatively long pelage is light or medium brown with white on the end of the tail and the ventrum. Pelage close to the hands and feet tends to be a medium to dark brown. Hands, feet, and face are all black. These primates do not appear to show any sexual dimorphism in relation to pelage coloration.\n\nOne feature, in combination with their pelage coloration, that helps to separate kipunjis from their \"Cercocebus\" and \"Lophocebus\" relativess is the broad crest of hair on the crown of their heads.\n\nAround 1,100 of the animals live in the highland Ndundulu Forest Reserve, a forest adjacent to Udzungwa Mountains National Park, and in a disjunct population 250 miles away on Mount Rungwe and in Kitulo National Park, which is adjacent to it. The forest at Rungwe is highly degraded, and fragmentation of the remaining forest threatens to split that population into three smaller populations. The Ndundulu forest is in better shape, but the population there is smaller.\n\nThe kipunji is classified as an endangered species by the IUCN. In 2008, a Wildlife Conservation Society team found that the monkey's range is restricted to just 6.82 mi (17.7 km) of forest in the two isolated regions, the Ndundulu forest and the Rungwe-Livingstone forest. The Ndundulu forest is the smaller of the two and was found to support a population of 75 individuals, ranging from 15 to 25 individuals per group. The Rungwe-Livingstone forest is suspected to contain 1,042 individuals in Rungwe-Kitulo, ranging from 25 to 39 individuals per group. All areas where the kipunji is found are considered protected areas, but no management operations are currently in effect.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the projected decline of the species, including predation, habitat destruction, and hunting. The kipunji has only two known predators: crowned eagles (\"Stephanoaetus coronatus\") and leopards (\"Panthera pardus\"). The biggest threats to the species come from human activities. Logging for timber and charcoal production are the most prominent threats, but locals are also known to hunt the kipunji due to its crop-destroying habits or simply as a food source. Continued habitat loss is anticipated to cause a loss of the Bujingijila Corridor that links two populations in the Mount Rungwe and Livingstone forests.\n\nThe species was included in the list of \"The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates\" in 2006 and 2008.\n\n"}

This role had been successively filled by Alex St. Clair, John French, and Bill Harkleroad on his previous albums. With the entire Magic Band having quit after the recording of his previous album he no longer had such an intermediary. As a result, the album is generally considered the nadir of Van Vliet's musical career.
