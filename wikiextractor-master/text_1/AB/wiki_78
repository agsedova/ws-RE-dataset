The region lies in a geographic region known as southern \"Djursland\", and more specifically \"Mols\". The municipality covered an area of 276 km, and had a total population of 14.997 (2003). Its last mayor was Jørgen Brøgger. The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Ebeltoft.\n\nEbeltoft municipality ceased to exist as the result of \"Kommunalreformen\" (\"The Municipality Reform\" of 2007). It was merged with existing Midtdjurs, Rosenholm, and Rønde municipalities to form the new Syddjurs municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 693 km and a total population of 40,196 (2005). The new municipality belongs to Region Midtjylland (\"Mid-Jutland Region\").\n\nThe municipality itself consisted of two smaller peninsulas that jut out into the surrounding waters, one to the south, and the other to the west. The southward peninsula, which contains the town of Ebeltoft, is surrounded on the east by Hjelm Deep, which separates the area from the small island of Hjelm off its eastern coast. To the west of this peninsula is Ebeltoft Cove (\"Ebeltoft Vig\") which forms a bay between the southward peninsula and the headland formed to the south of the westward peninsula, Helge Headland (\"Helgenæs\"). To the west of Helge Headland is Aarhus Bay (\"Aarhus Bugt\"). To the northwest of the westward peninsula is Knebel Cove (\"Knebel Vig\") and Kalø Cove (\"Kalø Vig\").\n\nThe municipality also was home to Lake Stubbe (\"Stubbe Sø\") and several high elevations. The high hilly moraine landscape is called Mols Bjerge (*Mols Hills*), and is a protected as Mols Bjerge National Park. Some of the highest elevations in the area are \"Agri Bavnehøj\" at 137 meters, \"Trehøje\" at 127 meters, and \"Stabelhøjene\" at 135 and 133 meters in height. The area has many burial mounds, stone monuments and graves, including \"Porskær Stenhus\", Denmark's largest stone burial chamber near the town of Knebel. \"Porskær Stenhus\" is over 2,000 years old.\n\nThe municipality was created in 1970 due to a (\"Municipality Reform\") that combined the following parishes: Agri, Dråby, Ebeltoft, Egens, Fuglslev, Helgenæs, Hyllested, Knebel, Rolsø, Rosmus, Tirstrup, Tved, and Vistoft parishes.\n\nMols is an area in the southern part of \"Djursland\" on Jutland's east coast with Ebeltoft as its main city. The residents of this area are known as \"Molboere\" (\"Mols residents\"). There have been written many fictional accounts of the stupidity of these people, referred to as \"Molbohistorier\" (\"Stories of the Mols residents\").\n\nEbeltoft was granted its municipal charter in 1301. The town is very picturesque, and has many well-preserved half-timbered houses and cobbled streets.\n\nAmong the town's highlights are the Frigate \"Jylland\" (Fregatten \"Jylland\"), the Ebeltoft Zoo, the Ebeltoft Museum, and the Glasmuseet Ebeltoft (Ebeltoft Glass Museum).\n\n\n\n"}

After starting his career at Reading, Walker played as a goalkeeper in the Football League for five clubs, most notably Watford and Colchester United. He later managed Colchester, Norwich City, Everton and APOEL. In 2010, he was inducted into the Colchester United Football Club Hall of Fame.\n\nWalker represented Wales at under-23 level on four occasions. His son Ian, also a goalkeeper, later played for England's senior team.\n\nWalker started his playing career as a goalkeeper with Reading in January 1963. He joined Shrewsbury Town in June 1964 and also played for York City F.C., Watford F.C., Charlton Athletic and most notably Colchester United for whom he made 363 league appearances for. Perhaps the most memorable moment in Walker's playing career came when lower division Watford knocked Bill Shankly's Liverpool out of the FA Cup in February 1970, in what was considered to be a major cup upset and a result which convinced Shankly of the need to dismantle his aging side and begin building a new team. Walker himself played a vital part in Watford's victory by saving a penalty, something which endeared him to Everton supporters many years before he became Everton manager.\n\nWalker was inducted into the Colchester United Hall of Fame in the 2009–10 season, in recognition for his service to the club as a player and manager. Also inducted that season was Walker's former Watford and Colchester teammate Mick Packer.\n\nWalker had a brief spell in charge of Colchester United in 1986 but was sacked in 1987 whilst top of the league. He then took charge of the Norwich City youth team in 1987. In 1992, he was promoted to the position of manager at Carrow Road and gave Norwich their highest-ever league finish in the new FA Premier League where they finished third and qualified for the 1993/94 UEFA Cup — the first time they had qualified for European competition (Norwich had technically qualified for Europe twice in the 1980s but were unable to enter due to the ban on English clubs imposed after the Heysel Disaster). Norwich achieved a famous victory over FC Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup Second Round before being knocked out by the eventual winners, Internazionale. Due to his notable achievements at a relatively small club such as Norwich, Walker was felt by many commentators at this time to be one of the most promising new managers in English football, and he was praised for the positive, attack-minded passing game played by his Norwich side.\n\nWalker quit Norwich in January 1994, following a long running feud with Chairman Robert Chase (mainly centring on Chase's habit of selling off the club's key players without consulting his manager first - for example Robert Fleck to Chelsea just after Walker's appointment), to become manager of Everton, with Everton having to pay substantial compensation to Norwich to secure his services. Walker failed, however, to meet the high expectations of a bigger club. Although Walker oversaw an extraordinary last day escape from relegation with Everton securing a 3-2 home victory over Wimbledon (Everton had been 2-0 down, and 2-1 down at half time), Everton made a disastrous start to the 1994/95 season, failing to win a single league game until November. With Everton bottom of the table and having made their worst ever start to a league season, Walker was sacked having spent just ten months in charge and recording only six league wins, leaving him with the worst record of any post-war Everton manager. Walker was nicknamed the 'Silver Fox' during his time at Goodison, and one of the more positive aspects of his reign was his decision to bring the controversial Rangers striker Duncan Ferguson to Everton on loan, a gamble which ultimately paid off after Walker's departure with Joe Royle signing the Scot on a permanent basis.\n\nAfter Walker's dismissal, Everton went on that season to not only successfully avoid relegation but also win the FA Cup under Royle.\n\nWalker did not return to football until taking over again at Norwich in June 1996, by which time the Canaries had been relegated to Division One. He remained in charge for two seasons but resigned after they failed to return to the Premiership. Since leaving Norwich, Walker has had a spell managing in Cyprus for APOEL, where he resides to this day.\n\nWalker is the father of Ian Walker, former England goalkeeper. He also has a son, David and a daughter, Ursula. His wife and the mother of his children, Jacqueline \"Jackie\" Walker, died on 3 November 1997 after a long battle against cancer.\n\nWatford\n\nIndividual\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

She was named after Commodore Edward Preble (1761–1807).\n\n\"Preble\" first sailed for Labrador, and then went to cruise in the Mediterranean Sea in 1843. She was attached to the African Squadron in 1845. In 1846, \"Preble\" sailed for New York and joined the Pacific Squadron on the West Coast of the United States, where she participated in the Mexican–American War. In 1848, Captain James Glynn took her first to Hong Kong and then to Nagasaki, Japan, where she picked up some fourteen American and Hawaiian seamen who had become castaways in that \"closed country\". In November 1850, she returned to the east coast of the United States, where she became a practice ship for midshipmen until 1857, when she was placed in ordinary service.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, in July 1861, \"Preble\" joined the Gulf Blockading Squadron and participated to the blockade of the Mississippi River. She was posted at Head of the Passes on the Mississippi River on 12 October 1861 when the blockading squadron there was attacked by a Confederate States Navy force that included the first ironclad warship, CSS \"Manassas\". Being a-sail-powered ship, she did not join the battle but rather made a swift retreat out the Southwest Pass to safety in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"Preble\" was serving as a guard ship when, on 27 April 1863, while moored in Pensacola Bay off Pensacola, Florida, she caught fire due to the carelessness of a crewman. She was abandoned and exploded.\n\nIn 1963, U.S. Navy divers discovered the wreck of \"Preble\". They retrieved a number of artifacts.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Human analysts would then be able to modify the diagram to test various cases.\n\nCompanies such as Integral Visuals, Saffron Technology, and Syntek Technologies were involved in Genoa's development. It cost a total of $42 million to complete the program.\n\nGenoa was conceived in late 1995 by retired Rear Admiral John Poindexter, a chief player in the Iran-Contra Affair. At the time, Poindexter was working at Syntek, a company often contracted to do work for the Department of Defense. He proposed a computer system that would help humans crunch large amounts of data in order to more effectively predict potential national security threats. Poindexter brought his ideas to former colleagues working with the United States National Security Council.\n\nThat year, a team of researchers was assembled for the project and began studying various historical events to which Genoa could be applied. The Tokyo subway sarin attack in March was the primary focus. Instead of analyzing the attack itself, the researchers looked into the history of Aum Shinrikyo, the group that perpetrated the attack, to find evidence that could've suggested their intentions.\n\nIn order to pitch their ideas, the researchers set up a mock crisis command center in DARPA's main building, full of monitors staffed by actors. An audience would watch as a fictitious scenario would unfold before them, guided along by an animated video segment. Poindexter called the presentation \"A Day in the Life of an Analyst.\" Another mock center was set up near the DARPA building with the help of a Hollywood set designer to serve the same purpose. Prominent viewers of the exhibition included Richard A. Clarke, John Michael McConnell, and James R. Clapper.\n\nGenoa was commissioned in 1996 for development overseen by DARPA and completed in the 2002 fiscal year, becoming a component of the Total Information Awareness program. It was concluded that while Genoa helped officials better understand complex situations, it operated at a slow speed. The research initiated by the project was continued in its immediate follow-on program, Genoa II. One of the goals of this successor was to increase the speed of analyses.\nThe program was actively utilized by the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\n"}

The usual formula the stories followed was for the title character to solve a problem bedeviling some manner of being or extricate himself from a dangerous situation. The events could take place all over the galaxy and in various historical or future periods on Earth and elsewhere. In his adventures, Feghoot worked for the Society for the Aesthetic Re-Arrangement of History and traveled via a device that had no name, but was typographically represented as the \")(\". The pieces were usually vignettes only a few paragraphs long, and always ended with a deliberately terrible pun that was often based on a well-known title or catch-phrase.\n\n\"Through Time and Space with Ferdinand Feghoot\" was originally published in the magazine \"Fantasy and Science Fiction\" from 1956 to 1973. In 1973, the magazine ran a contest soliciting readers' feghoots as entries. The series also appeared in \"Fantasy and Science Fiction\"'s sister magazine \"Venture Science Fiction Magazine\", and later in \"Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine\", \"Amazing Stories\", and other publications. The individual pieces were identified by Roman numerals rather than titles. The stories have been collected in several editions, each an expanded version of the previous, the most recent being \"The Collected Feghoot\" from Pulphouse Publishing.\n\nMany of the ideas and puns for Bretnor's stories were contributed by others, including F. M. Busby and E. Nelson Bridwell. Other authors have published feghoots written on their own, including Isaac Asimov and John Brunner. Numerous fan-produced stories have been written, as well.\n\nBretnor said that the idea of the name occurred to his wife and him during a game of Scrabble. He always arranged his letter tiles alphabetically; at one point, he had EFGHOOT. His wife suggested that, if the first two letters were transposed, the silly name 'Feghoot' could be formed. Bretnor did so, and began using the name in his punny stories.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2014458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2014458", "title": "Mizar", "text": "Mizar\n\nMizar is a second-magnitude star in the handle of the Big Dipper asterism in the constellation of Ursa Major. It has the Bayer designation ζ Ursae Majoris (Latinised as Zeta Ursae Majoris). It forms a well-known naked eye double star with the fainter star Alcor, and is itself a quadruple star system. The whole system lies about 83 light-years away from the Sun, as measured by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, and is part of the Ursa Major Moving Group.\n\n\"ζ Ursae Majoris\" (Latinised to \"Zeta Ursae Majoris\" and abbreviated to ζ UMa or Zeta UMa) is Mizar's Bayer designation. It also has the Flamsteed designation 79 Ursae Majoris.\n\nThe traditional name \"Mizar\" derives from the Arabic ' ' meaning 'apron; wrapper, covering, cover'. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included \"Mizar\" for ζ UMa. According to IAU rules, the name Mizar strictly only applies to component Aa, although it is traditionally and popularly used for all four stars making up the single naked-eye star.\n\nMizar is a visual double with a separation of 14.4 arcseconds, each of which is a spectroscopic binary. Its combined apparent magnitude is 2.04. The two visible stars are referred to as ζ and ζ Ursae Majoris, or Mizar A and B. The spectroscopic components are generally referred to as Mizar Aa, Ab, Ba, and Bb. The stars all share a single Hipparcos designation of HIP 65378, but separate Bright Star Catalogue and Henry Draper Catalogue entries. Mizar, together with Alcor and many of the other bright stars in Ursa Major, is a member of the Ursa Major Moving Group.\n\nAn easily split visual target, Mizar was the first telescopic binary discovered, most probably by Benedetto Castelli who in 1617 asked Galileo Galilei to observe it. Galileo then produced a detailed record of the double star. Later, around 1650, Riccioli wrote of Mizar appearing as a double. The secondary star (Mizar B) comes within 380 AU of the primary (Mizar A) and the two take thousands of years to revolve around each other.\n\nMizar A was the first spectroscopic binary to be discovered, as part of Antonia Maury's spectral classification work, and an orbit was published in 1890. Some spectroscopic binaries cannot be visually resolved and are discovered by studying the spectral lines of the suspect system over a long period of time. The two components of Mizar A are both about 35 times as bright as the Sun, and revolve around each other in about 20 days 12 hours and 55 minutes. In 1908, Mizar B was also found to be a spectroscopic binary, its components completing an orbital period every six months. In 1996, 107 years after their discovery, the components of the Mizar A binary system were imaged in extremely high resolution using the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer.\n\nThe two components of ζ Ursae Majoris (Mizar Aa and Ab) are observed to be identical, with the exception of slightly different radial velocity variations which indicate very slightly different masses.\n\nThe spectral lines of the two stars can be observed separately and both are given a spectral type of A2Vp. They are Ap stars, chemically peculiar due to stratification of some heavy elements in the photosphere of slowly-rotating hot stars. In this case, they show elevated abundances of strontium and silicon.\n\nWith the assumption of identical physical properties for the two stars, they both have temperatures of 9,000 K, radii of , and bolometric luminosities of . They are thought to be around 370 million years old.\n\nζ Ursae Majoris is a single-lined spectroscopic binary, and the visible spectrum is of an Am star, named for their unusually strong lines of some metals. The spectral type of kA1h(eA)mA7IV-V is in a form used for metallic-lined stars: the type is A1 based on the calcium K lines, early A based on the hydrogen lines, and A7 based on lines of other metals. The luminosity class is ranked between main sequence and subgiant.\n\nBased on the orbital properties of the system, the total mass of the two stars is approximately 1.73 solar masses, most of which is contributed by the primary star. The secondary is a red dwarf.\n\nMizar is known as Vashistha one of the Saptarishi, in traditional Indian astronomy.\n\nChinese Taoism personifies ζ Ursae Majoris as the Lu star.\n\nIn Chinese, (), meaning \"Northern Dipper\", refers to an asterism equivalent to the Big Dipper. Consequently, the Chinese name for ζ Ursae Majoris itself is Běi Dǒu liù, () and Kāi Yáng, ().\n\nMizar is Chickadee and Alcor is his cooking pot in the Mi'kmaq myth of the great bear and the seven hunters.\n\n\n\n"}

The inhabitants of this era are immortal decadents, who create flights of fancy via the use of power rings that draw on energy devised and stored by their ancestors millions of years prior. Time travel is possible, and throughout the series various points in time are visited and revisited. Space travellers are also common, but most residents of the End of Time find leaving the planet distasteful and clichéd. The title of the series is itself taken from a poem by a fictitious 19th-century poet, Ernest Wheldrake, which Mrs. Amelia Underwood quotes in \"The End of All Songs\". \"Ernest Wheldrake\" had been a pseudonym used by Algernon Charles Swinburne.\n\nThe original trilogy (\"An Alien Heat\", \"The Hollow Lands\", and \"The End of All Songs\") was published between 1972 and 1976. The trilogy purports to tell the last love story in human history. Other stories in this sequence include \"The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming\" (also known as \"A Messiah at the End of Time\") which is a rewrite of the novella \"Constant Fire\". Several short stories, some of which were included in the collection \"Legends from the End of Time\", were published in \"New Worlds 7–10\" (the paperback revival of the magazine). Short stories featuring Elric (\"Elric at the End of Time\"), and Jerry Cornelius (\"The Murderer's Song\") also feature characters and places from the End of Time.\n\nMain characters in the series include Jherek Carnelian, one of the few humans at the End of Time to have been born naturally, rather than created; Mrs Amelia Underwood, a time traveller from the late 19th century; the enigmatic Lord Jagged; and Miss Mavis Ming in the eponymous \"The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming\", which also features the Fireclown. (The 1993 Millennium omnibus edition of \"Legends from the End of Time\" ostensibly assembles all the stories and \"The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming\" – under the title \"Constant Fire\" – but was affected by severe printing errors and omits the final six lines of \"Elric at the End of Time\" and all but the final chapter of \"Constant Fire\". These were corrected for the 1997 Orion edition.)\n\nThe prologue of \"An Alien Heat\" calls it \"a story of Jherek Carnelian, who did not know the meaning of morality, and Mrs. Amelia Underwood, who knew everything about it\". The novel begins with a discussion between Jherek Carnelian and his mother, the Iron Orchid, about the meaning of the word \"virtuous\". Carnelian, who has looked the word up in an ancient dictionary, finds the concept \"bewildering\".\n\nJherek meets his future love, Amelia Underwood, at an extravagant party hosted by the Duke of Queens, the theme of which is \"disaster\". The Duke of Queens intends the centerpiece of this entertainment to be an alien, Yusharisp, who tries to warn them that the universe will soon end; the people merely find this boring, and the entertainment falls flat. My Lady Charlotina freezes Yusharisp for transport to her menagerie. Jherek is delighted when Mrs. Amelia Underwood reacts to this by exclaiming \"Let the poor creature go! Though he is neither human nor Christian, he is still one of God's creatures and has a right to his liberty!\"\n\nAn example of how lightly sex, including incest and homosexuality, is treated at the End of Time can be found in the early chapters of \"An Alien Heat\". In the chapter \"A Conversation with the Iron Orchid\" Jherek has sex with his mother, and in the chapter \"Carnelian Conceives a New Affectation\" he has a same-sex encounter with Lord Jagged. (Likewise, in \"Legends from the End of Time\", the Iron Orchid makes love to My Lady Charlotina.) When Jherek decides to fall in love with Mrs. Underwood to the exclusion of everyone else, everyone applauds his original thinking.\n\nThe landscapes at the End of Time are almost entirely artificial or illusory, created by the inhabitants and constantly being altered. In the first chapter of \"An Alien Heat\", the Iron Orchid and Jherek Carnelian awaken after the picnic they have created to find that the sea has been turned a shade of cerise, and the cliff with two palm trees that had previously been behind them had been replaced by a twelve-story silver pagoda. Beneath the decoration, however, the Earth is a sterile wasteland lit by a dim red sun.\n\nIn the short story \"Elric at the End of Time\" the inhabitants of the end of time attempt to entertain Elric of Melniboné (and amuse themselves) by creating an adventure to keep Elric occupied. Elric is no stranger to chaos and is completely convinced that he has in fact been transported to a realm of chaos. This is largely due to the unexpected, bizarre (and often instantaneous) changes which his hosts make to the landscape.\n\nThe title of this volume comes from the poem \"Hothouse Flowers\" by Theodore Wratislaw.\n\nAn alien named Yusharisp comes to Earth to warn its remaining inhabitants that the universe is coming to an end; his own planet has already disappeared, and the Earth is sure to follow. Earth's inhabitants are unfazed as they believe him to be yet another doomsayer; the End of the Earth has been predicted for centuries. Jherek is far more interested in Mrs Amelia Underwood, a time traveller from Victorian England, as he is fascinated by the Victorian era. Jherek resolves to fall in love with her. Mrs Underwood, at first repulsed by the debauchery of the End of Time, finally comes to believe that Jherek is sincere in his affections and starts teaching him about moral values. She falls in love with him at last; as they are about to embrace, however, she is returned to her own time. Jherek, heartbroken, decides to rescue her, and travels to 19th-century London, using the time machine from Moorcock's \"Behold the Man\"\n\nJherek is inexperienced to the point of naivete about the Victorian Era, despite his interest in it, and a (temporally) local thief, Snoozer Vine, tricks him into becoming an accomplice to Snoozer's latest scam. Not surprisingly, Jherek proves to be a poor criminal, and is quickly arrested, jailed and sent to trial. To his surprise, the judge appears to be none other than his friend, Lord Jagged, but claims to be one Jagger. Jherek is sentenced to death, as the case against him is unequivocal, but he cannot understand why all the people around him are so upset; inhabitants of the End of Time are immortal, and for them death is merely transitory. Jherek is hanged, only to wake up among his friends at the End of Time, who tell him that to them, he has only been gone for a second.\n\nThe title of this volume comes from the poem \"The Last Word\" by Ernest Dowson.\n\nReunited at the end of Time, Jherek and the other inhabitants of the End of Time have returned to their preferred amusements of parties and games. They are interrupted by a ship of alien musician/pirates, the Lat. Hunted by the Lat, Jherek stumbles into a subterranean school built centuries ago to protect the last children of that era from the tyrant director Pecking Pa the Eighth (a reference to Sam Peckinpah). The time in the school is constantly recycled by a robot nanny so old she has started to break down, and as a result is recycling the same week repeatedly. The teacher-robot mistakes Jherek for one of her children as she has forgotten that there is anything outside her school, and keeps him. When she realises her mistake, she agrees to send him back to 1896; her ability to recycle time means that she can function as a time machine.\n\nReturned to the 19th century, Jherek heads for Bromley, where Mrs Amelia Underwood lives. On the way, Jherek meets H.G. Wells and explains that he is a time traveller, but is met only with Wells's ironic disbelief. Jherek is finally reunited with Mrs Underwood but also forced to confront her husband Mr Underwood. Mr. Underwood is so suspicious of their story that a reluctant Mrs Underwood runs away with Jherek. Chased by the police, the two are rescued by a journalist, Mr Jackson who, like Judge Jagger, bears a strong resemblance to Lord Jagged.\n\nThe police catch up with the fleeing couple, but are interrupted in their attempted arrest by the appearance of the Lat, the Iron Orchid and a number of other residents of the End of Time. Chaos ensues as the police and the Lat start fighting, and the fabric of time itself begins disintegrating. The time travellers start vanishing, and Jackson, who finally reveals himself to be Lord Jagged (also Judge Jagger), takes Jherek and Mrs Underwood to a time machine that will take them to the End of Time. The machine appears to malfunction; instead of delivering them to the End of Time, it maroons them in what appears to be the Lower Devonian period.\n\nThe title of this volume comes from the poem \"Dregs\" by Ernest Dowson.\n\nJherek and Mrs Amelia Underwood, after spending some time alone in the Devonian, meet Una Persson and Captain Oswald Bastable, who introduce themselves as members of the Guild of Temporal Adventurers. They explain the notion of the multiverse as the combination of all simultaneously existing realities before sending Jherek and Amelia back to the End of Time. There, Jherek finds all his friends who had vanished from 1896 alive and well, except for Lord Jagged who has yet to return. Amelia is now more tolerant towards the people of the End of Time, though still occasionally revolted by their lack of morals. She and Jherek resume the life they led in \"An Alien Heat\", which is interrupted by the sudden arrival of a shell shocked, crazed Mr Underwood, Inspector Springer and a dozen policemen, and the Lat.\n\nJherek, the Duke of Queens, the policemen, Amelia and Mr Underwood seek refuge from the Lat in one of the Lost Cities, which hold the energy used by the people of the End of Time to alter matter through their rings, and are surprised to find it crumbling, and the sun gone. They are joined by Yusharisp and the end-of-time resident Lord Mongrove, a manic-depressive giant who explains that the apocalypse has begun, and that they are the sole survivors. The group realises with horror that their energy rings are no longer working. In light of their impending doom, Amelia finally admits that her love for Jherek is more important to her than morals or convention.\n\nThe Iron Orchid and Lord Jagged, by now assumed to be dead, appear. Lord Jagged reveals himself to be Jherek's father, and a time traveller from the 21st century. After learning of the Earth's impending destruction, he sought to preserve humanity by sending a \"new Adam and Eve\" to the beginning of time, thus creating a loop that would prevent humanity from spending thousands of years relearning the basics of civilisation. For genetic reasons, he chose Jherek and Amelia and orchestrated their meeting. Amelia and Jherek's marooning in the Devonian was not part of the plan; they did not, in fact, travel back in time, but too far into the future, past the end of the world in which they were currently residing. Upon realising this, Jagged understood that time is circular, not linear as was previously assumed, and devised a new plan. While his friends are devastated, he shows unwavering optimism and surprises everyone by creating a new sun with his energy ring. He proceeds to explain that energy can be drawn from any existing reality within the multiverse; this, combined with the technology that \"recycled\" time in the underground school, can be used to sustain the Earth forever.\n\nNow reassured that the Earth is safe in a time loop and provided with a new source of energy, the End of Timers resurrect their friends who died in the aborted apocalypse, and rebuild their world. Amelia, now comfortable at the End of Time, becomes popular. During a visit to Mr Underwood in the Lost City, she is faced with his conviction that she is damned when she tells him of her belief that God is dead. While she struggles with her conscience and her newfound atheism, her husband travels back to the 19th century and she decides to marry Jherek. When Lord Jagged offers to send both her and Jherek into the future, out of the time loop and after the end of the world to start a new civilisation, they accept.\n\nPale Roses begins with the destruction of the rainbow part of Werther de Goethe's creation \"Rain\" by the Everlasting Concubine, Mistress Christia, and Werther's despair. After a short interlude, Werther discovers, by the use of a parachute that closely resembles a Hot air balloon, a child (Catherine Lily Marguerite Natasha Dolores Beatrice Machineshop-Seven Flambeau Gratitude) who is the fourteen-year-old daughter of two time travellers, and deigns to take on the role of her now deceased parents.\n\nFollowing a masquerade with the theme of Childhood, Werther is passionately overcome and engages in sexual intercourse with Catherine. After the event, disgusted by what he perceives to be the enormity of his acts, he is even more disgusted in Catherine for having enjoyed what she describes as \"le petit mal\". The story climaxes with Werther's suicide by jumping from his tower unaided by his parachute and his subsequent resurrection.\n\nIt is then revealed that Catherine is really Mistress Christia in disguise, the series of events being an attempt to reconcile after her having destroyed his rainbow.\n\nWhite Stars: after discovering that he had inadvertently destroyed one of Lord Shark the Unknown's experiments with lichen, the Duke of Queens offers to duel with him to rid himself of his guilt.\n\nIn Ancient Shadows, a time traveller, Dafnish Armatuce, and her son, Snuffles, arrive at the End of Time, and become involved with Miss Mavis Ming.\n\nChronicling the transformation of Miss Mavis Ming and the parts played by Doctor Volospion, his fellow residents at the End of Time, and Mr Emmanuel Bloom, also known as The Fireclown. The ending originally involved a scene where the main character, Mavis Ming, was whipped into submission by Bloom. This was later rewritten by the author. The novel has also been published, with differences, under the titles \"A Messiah at the End of Time\" and \"Constant Fire\".\n\n\"Elric at the End of Time\" is one of two Elric short stories included in the eponymous collection, \"Elric at the End of Time\". Its characters include Elric, Una Persson, and Lord Jagged.\n\nJherek Carnelian, son of the Iron Orchid and an unknown father (later revealed to be Lord Jagged) is the protagonist of the novels \"An Alien Heat\", \"The Hollow Lands\" and \"The End of All Songs\". Jherek is almost unique among the natives of The End of Time, in that he was born, rather than created. Only Werther De Goethe is mentioned as also having been born, implying that this trait is something of a rarity in this time period.\n\nJherek's childhood and adolescence subsequently provided a great deal of novelty and interest for the Iron Orchid and her clique, and left Jherek with a notable childlike freshness and creativity, compared to the majority of his contemporaries. This makes him something of a trend-setter among his peers. In particular, his fascination with the past has made him a recognised expert in the field – the nearest thing The End of Time has to a historian. He is particularly interested in the 19th and early 20th centuries. A million or more years of lost records and misinformation have taken their toll, however, and Jherek's attempts to recreate elements of the era are often comically inaccurate.\n\nJherek's entire existence is later revealed to be part of a complicated scheme of Lord Jagged's to survive the End of Time by selectively breeding a race of humans whose DNA renders them immune to the tendency for time to heal itself by rejecting time travellers who journey to the past, and flinging them forward to their point of origin, or beyond. This tendency is called the \"Morphail Effect\" and it is named after Dr. Brannart Morphail, a character in the novel.\n\nJherek may be an incarnation of Moorcock's recurring character Jerry Cornelius.\n\nA denizen of 19th century Bromley, she arrives at a party hosted by the Duke of Queens under mysterious circumstances after she is kidnapped from her own age. She is married to the stuffy Mr. Underwood, who becomes a comic presence in the second and third books. She is a lovely young woman and, although her Victorian upbringing has made a strict moralist of her, she gradually begins to thaw under Jherek's influence. In her childhood, she travelled with her father, a missionary, into exotic locations: these experiences planted the seeds of tolerance.\n\nAt first, her sense of duty makes her tolerate Jherek, despite his vexing romantic blandishments; she tells herself that, as a good Christian, she must indoctrinate him into the mysteries of Virtue. Later, her personality begins to blossom, and she realises she loves Jherek.\n\nThe last woman to give birth on Earth, the Iron Orchid is Jherek's mother. Surprised that she had a child, she delights in her son, and encourages his creativity and endeavors. She is fond of Jherek's company, often having picnics with him.\n\nLord Jagged is a time traveller, and, unlike Jherek and the Iron Orchid, is not a native to the End of Time. He is the father of Jherek by the Iron Orchid, and is later shown to be manipulating various events that occur in the series.\n\nIn the short story, \"Elric at the End of Time\", Lord Jagged assumes the persona of the chaos Lord Arioch, returning Elric to his own realm. Una Persson later compliments him on the imitation, saying: \n\nLord Jagged, however, does not reply to this. Instead, he \"[puffs] on his pipe and [smiles] a secret and superior smile\".\n\nWerther de Goethe is named for the main character of Goethe's novel \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" and for Goethe himself, and is likewise angst ridden. He features as the main character in the short story \"Pale Roses\". Werther is the only other character from the end of time who was born, rather than created through the use of power rings.\n\nThe Duke of Queens is known throughout the End of Time for his outrageous creations. His first appearance is in \"An Alien Heat\". After having adjusted the geography where the Iron Orchid and Jherek lunched and turning the sea into a deep pink, described as almost cerise, he is shown to be once more experimenting with artificial wings, to the chagrin of Iron Orchid, who wonders why he insists that they are a success.\n\nMy Lady Charlotina lives under the last permanent body of water on Earth, Lake Billy the Kid. Capricious, she often changes her skin tone to unusual colors. A jealous collector, she has one of the world’s largest menageries of time and space travelers. She is the patron of Brannart Morphail whose laboratories share her apartments under the lake.\n\nBrannart Morphail is a self-styled scientist who specializes in Time and time travel. He is short, ugly, and has both a club foot and a hump. The Morphail Effect, a law of time that prevents time travel paradox, is named after him.\n\nMistress Christia is the expression of feminine beauty at the end of time. Beloved by all at the End of Time, she is a favorite at gatherings, always being the first to arrive.\n\nFormerly known as \"King Rook\", Bishop Castle has interest in all thing religious. He wears a ten-foot high mitre.\n\nLord Mongrove appears as a sad hulking giant. Obsessed with darker emotions, his style in clothing and dwelling are depressing, gloomy affairs. He claims he has no friends, but appreciates Werther de Goethe's aesthetic.\n\nLi Pao is a time traveler from the 23rd century. He is disgusted by the decadence and excesses of the people at the End of Time, and often chastises them for their amoral ways, despite always attending their parties and gatherings.\nMiss Mavis Ming appears in the short story \"Ancient Shadows\", playing host to Dafnish Armatuce and her son, Snuffles, and also in the novel \"The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming\", where she escapes from the machinations of Doctor Volospion. She has a small role in Moorcock's spy novel parody \"The Chinese Agent\" (1970), where she describes herself as a one-quarter Chinese former exotic dancer who used to perform a striptease under the name \"Dawn Flower Ming, the Geisha Gusher\".\n\nThe book is included in \"Interzone\" editor David Pringle's \"\" (1985). Hari Kunzru, writing in \"the Guardian\", described \"The Dancers at the End of Time\" trilogy as \"one of the great postwar English fantasies\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2014497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2014497", "title": "Alfred Hamish Reed", "text": "Alfred Hamish Reed\n\nSir Alfred Hamish Reed (30 December 1875 – 15 January 1975), generally known as A.H. Reed, was a New Zealand publisher, author and entrepreneur.\n\nAlfred Hamish Reed was born at Hayes, Middlesex, in England on 30 December 1875, the son of James William Reed and Elizabeth Reed. He was the second oldest of four children to parents who were devout Baptists and raised their children accordingly. His father James managed a brick field but in 1882 purchased his own brick business in Walthamstow and moved his family to the area. Alfred Reed was educated at a small private school and then, from 1883, Maynard Road School. The family were all avid readers, and for Reed, books would prove to be a lifelong passion.\n\nBy 1886, James Reed's brick business was failing and had to close. This prompted him to migrate with his family to New Zealand. His maternal uncle lived there, in Motueka, and reported favourably on New Zealand in his letters to his sister, Alfred's mother. After a six-week voyage aboard the \"Arawa\", the family arrived in Wellington in April 1887. They promptly travelled north to settle in Auckland but James Reed struggled to find employment. He eventually found work as a kauri gum digger in Northland while his family remained in Auckland. Elizabeth Reed supplemented the family's income through needlework. After several months, there was enough money to buy a block of land at Parahaki, to the east of Whangarei and the family moved there in late December 1887.\n\nLiving conditions were crude and the family lived simply, the parents instilling a strong work ethic in their children. Unable to find a Baptist church to attend, the family went to a Wesleyan Methodist church. They rejected an Anglican church that was closer to their home on the grounds that it was too conformist. Alfred Reed attended Whangarei Primary School from early 1888 but was soon withdrawn from it in favour of another school, operated on a part-time basis. Later in the year, he severely injured his leg to the point of being bedridden, with local doctors unable to diagnose the problem for 12 months. He was later sent to hospital in Auckland where infection of the femur bone was diagnosed. He stayed in hospital for a year, away from his parents who were unable to afford to visit him, and underwent three operations. He was eventually discharged in July 1890.\n\nReturning to live with his parents, Reed was conscious of the burden that the expense of his medical care had caused his parents and in light of this, he decided to start working on the kauri gum fields alongside his father rather than finish his schooling. The work was hard, involving the extraction of gum from the ground and packing it. He also worked on the family's farmlet and would take occasional jobs cutting scrub or working on road construction. Realising he needed a skill to further himself, he decided to learn Pitman's shorthand; he hoped that this would lead to a career as a reporter.\n\nBy late 1895 Reed had become so proficient in shorthand he was sufficiently confident to go to Auckland to look for reporting work. Approaches made to the New Zealand Herald and the Auckland Star were turned down so he took the opportunity to take typewriter lessons. For accommodation, he boarded with a couple who lived on Karangahape Road and made the acquaintance of their daughter, Harriet Isabel Fisher. Like Reed, she and her parents were English immigrants who had settled in Auckland in 1885. Known to Reed as Belle, she was nine years older and a devout Wesleyan Methodist.\nAt the typewriting school, he made the acquaintance of T. G. DeRenzy, the co-owner and manager of the New Zealand Typewriter Company, who at the end of the year offered Reed a job as a shorthand writer and message boy. He soon parted ways with his employer to take up an Auckland agency for Remington Typewriter Company but this proved short-lived. In June 1896, he returned to the New Zealand Typewriter Company. He soon progressed from doing shorthand work to travelling around the North Island, selling and repairing typewriters. Impressed by Reed's work ethic, honesty and diligence, DeRenzy offered him the opportunity to set up an office for the company in Dunedin, a challenge that Reed accepted.\n\nIn October 1897, Reed moved to Dunedin to start in his new role. In doing so he left behind a fiancée, having proposed to Belle earlier that year. The couple had decided Belle would stay in Auckland since they could not afford to marry. Reed quickly found suitable premises for the company's office and began retailing and repairing typewriters. Despite some hiccups, he soon began building the business and took on staff. After a year in Dunedin, and having secured a payrise, Reed returned to Auckland and married Belle at Pitt Street Methodist Church on 28 January 1899. The couple immediately travelled to Dunedin where they rented a house and settled down to life together. They lived simply and quietly, doing most things together although Reed would indulge in long solitary walks.\n\nReed continued to work on developing the Dunedin branch, which would prove to be only profitable office for the New Zealand Typewriter Company. The couple were also heavily involved in church life; Reed took charge of a Sunday School class at the Methodist Trinity Church and in 1898 qualified as a preacher. Two years later, he took over as superintendent of the Sunday School, which had a roll of 250 children, with Belle keeping the accounts. Short of teaching materials, Reed began exporting books and literature from suppliers in the United States. Initially this was for his own school but soon other churches in Dunedin showed interest and Reed started supplying them with excess material from his own orders. He and Belle soon expanded this into a nationwide mail order business.\n\nIn the meantime, DeRenzy wound up the New Zealand Typewriter Company but before doing so allowed Reed to purchase the Dunedin office on favourable terms. He and Belle continued to work on his mail order business, working out of a room at his office, with the sale and maintenance of typewriters providing regular income in the interim. While the financial reward of his day job was appreciated, Reed's passion was religious education and he saw his mail order business as doing God's work. By 1911, turnover for the business, which they called Sunday School Supply Stores, had reached ₤1,000 a year. On reaching this milestone, Reed sold his typewriter business to focus solely on the mail order business.\n\nSunday School Supply Stores provided a range of goods, from cards, badges, clocks, hymn sheets, blackboards and the like to religious games, as well as bibles, tracts and testaments. Reed also launched into the book trade, supplying religious works for presentation to children as prizes. These were sourced from local representatives of overseas publishing houses. He took up the New Zealand agency for teaching materials for Sunday school teachers produced by an English publisher, and also was the local agent for a company that purchased religious books as publishers' remainders.\n\nOn the outbreak of the First World War, Reed joined the Territorial Force, New Zealand's part-time military reserve. While his business took up his working days, he trained in army techniques and weaponry. By 1916, with New Zealand soldiers now serving on the Western Front and in the Sinai and Palestine theatre of operations, Reed felt it his duty to volunteer for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) for service aboard. Assessed as sufficiently fit for overseas service, he and Belle sold the Sunday School Supply Stores business. This allowed him to clear the mortgage on the couple's residence, which they had purchased in 1901. Belle stayed on at the business, working for the new owner.\n\nReed reported for duty on 21 September 1916, and was sent to Trentham Military Camp near Wellington for training. His contingent, the 21st Reinforcements, was the last group where all the recruits were volunteers. The New Zealand Government was to shortly introduced conscription to help maintain the flow of manpower to the NZEF. After a short period of training at Trentham, a further, more intensive, program of training commenced at Featherston Military Camp in the Wairarapa. With his strong Christian background, Reed found some aspects of military life difficult, particular the language and lurid storytelling that would occur in the camp's huts at night. He urged his fellow soldiers to avoid alcohol, blasphemy and to refrain from cursing. He even distributed a short tract to his hut mates suggesting that if they felt the need to curse, to substitute 'crimson' or 'purple' for swear words. Reed later recounted hearing a non-commissioned officer referring to a soldier as a 'crimson cow'.\n\nThe 21st Reinforcements were scheduled to depart overseas in early 1917 but in December 1916, Reed's shorthand skills were discovered and he was asked to volunteer for the headquarters staff at Featherston Camp. He declined, preferring to go on active duty aboard, but was overruled and ordered to report to the camp's headquarters. Reed was dissatisfied with his posting, seeing it as one that could be easily fulfilled by a medically unfit man while he should be doing his duty at the frontlines.\n\nReed entered the bookselling trade when he founded the firm of A. H. and A. W. Reed, a leading publisher of New Zealand-related non-fiction and reference works, in association with his nephew Alexander Wyclif Reed. In 1932, he branched out as a publisher and in 1935 he became an author.\n\nReed also undertook walking and mountain-climbing expeditions. He climbed Mount Taranaki/Egmont (aged 80), Mount Ruapehu (aged 83), Ngauruhoe (aged 85), walked from North Cape to Bluff, now known as the Te Araroa Trail (aged 85) and from East Cape to Cape Egmont (aged 86), walked through Marlborough (aged 87) and through Otago, Canterbury, Westland, and the Haast (aged 88).\n\nIn 1938 Reed and his wife established the Alfred and Isabel and Marian Reed Trust for the promotion of Christianity, education, literature and philanthropy for the people of New Zealand. The trust has amassed a collection of rare books and manuscripts for the Dunedin Public Libraries, including one of the most comprehensive collections of manuscripts and early printed Bibles in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nIn the 1948 King's Birthday Honours Reed was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services in connexion with publication of historical and other New Zealand works. He was promoted to Commander of the same Order (CBE) in the 1962 New Year Honours, in recognition of his contribution as a writer and publisher of New Zealand historical works. In the 1974 Queen's Birthday Honours Reed was knighted for services to literature and culture.\n\nReed died at Dunedin on 15 January 1975, and his ashes were buried at Dunedin Northern Cemetery. Soon after the death of his uncle, Clif Reed wrote a short book of his experiences working with him. This was published as \"Young Kauri\" later that year. The publishing institution that he set up was eventually sold in 1983 to the Australian company Associated Book Publishers.\n\nThere are several memorials in Reed's memory: The A. H. Reed Memorial Kauri Park Scenic Reserve, near Whangarei, commemorates his association with the district, while there is a memorial plaque dedicated to him in Dunedin's Octagon.\n\nReed wrote a number of books, including:\n\nHe also edited several books, including:\n\n\n\n"}

Parallax measurements yield a distance estimate of from the Sun.\n\nDelta Ursae Majoris has 63% more mass than the Sun and is about 1.4 times its radius. It has a stellar classification of A3 V, which means it is an A-type main sequence star that is generating energy at its core through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen. It shines at 14 times the luminosity of the Sun, with this energy being emitted from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 9,480 K. This gives it the white hue typical of an A-type star.\n\nThis star has an excess emission of infrared radiation, indicating the presence of circumstellar matter. This forms a debris disk around an orbital radius of 16 Astronomical Units from the star. This radius is unusually small for the estimated age of the disk, which may be explained by drag from the Poynting–Robertson effect causing the dust to spiral inward.\n\nIt has two faint companions, a 10th magnitude star and an 11th magnitude star, both at an angular separation of two arcminutes from the primary.\n\nDelta Ursae Majoris is a marginally outlying member of the Ursa Major moving group, an association of stars that share a common motion through space and likely formed in the same molecular cloud.

Each NECBL team plays an eight-week, 44-game schedule during June and July, with a playoff in early August. Like the Cape Cod Baseball League and other amateur leagues, the NECBL is a showcase for top college-level players, giving professional baseball scouts a chance to see prospective pros playing against each other. Along with the Cape Cod Baseball League, Northwoods League, and Coastal Plain League, it is considered one of the top summer leagues in the country and is a part of the National Alliance of College Summer Baseball. In 2019, the Collegiate Summer Baseball Register ranked the NECBL as the 2nd best collegiate summer baseball league, behind only the Cape Cod League.\n\nFounded in 1993, the NECBL began its direction under George Foster, former Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets All-Star and Major League Baseball home run leader, and Emmy Award-winning television producer/director Joseph Consentino. Play started in 1994 and today the NECBL has become a strong twelve-team league that plays in all six New England states. It recruits players attending U.S. colleges from New England, the other 44 states, and foreign countries, provided that they come from NCAA-sanctioned colleges or universities, are in good academic standing, have completed at least one year of athletic eligibility, and have at least one year of eligibility remaining.\n\nThe NECBL's current commissioner is Sean McGrath, former general manager of the North Adams SteepleCats.

On October 30, 2015, the league announced that the Upper Valley Nighthawks would begin play in 2016 in Hartford, Vermont, bringing the league back to 13 teams. The Plymouth Pilgrims ceased operations after the 2018 season but were replaced by the Martha's Vineyard Sharks, a former member of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL). The New Bedford BaySox ceased after the 2019 season, replaced by the Bristol Blues, who also moved from the FCBL.\n\n\nFor the current season, the league is divided into two six-team divisions, the North Division and the South Division. During the regular season, teams play in-division opponents a total of six times, three games at home and three away. Teams play out-of-division opponents twice, one game at home and one away. These games make up the 44 game regular season schedule. When doubleheaders are scheduled due to inclement weather, NECBL rules dictate that they are two seven-inning games. Until the end of the 2016 season, NECBL regular season games had 2 umpires, while All-Star and playoff games have 3 or 4 umpires. As of the 2017 season, all NECBL regular season games have 3-man umpiring crews. The top four teams from each division qualify for the playoffs. In the division semifinal round the first seeds play the fourth seeds and the second seeds play the third seeds, respectively, in best-of-three series. The winners of the division semifinals advance to the division finals, where they play a best-of-three series against their fellow division finalist. The division champions advance to the NECBL championship series, where they face each other in a best-of-three series to decide the NECBL champion.\n\nIn the NECBL's history, the most successful team is the Newport Gulls, with six league championships and eleven championship series appearances (including one championship appearance as the Cranston, Rhode Island-based Rhode Island Gulls). The defunct North Shore Navigators franchise had four league titles. The Keene Swamp Bats have four league titles. The Vermont Mountaineers have three league titles. A pair of franchises have won two championships, the Sanford Mainers and the defunct Central Mass Collegians. The Mystic Schooners won a single championship, when the team was known as the Eastern Tides in the league's inaugural 1994 season.\nThe following former NECBL players have gone on to play in Major League Baseball. Former NECBL players have reached the major league rosters of all thirty MLB teams, the thirtieth team being the Philadelphia Phillies when, in September 2015, Brian Bogusevic debuted with the team.\nAll NECBL games are broadcast online through the NECBL Broadcast Network, with Pointstreak providing both audio and video for all games.\n\nOn May 14, 2010, the league signed an agreement with Pointstreak. Pointstreak provides \"real-time scoring, official statistics, and administration services\" to the NECBL. A highlight of Pointstreak's services is Game Live, a real-time statistics feature providing play-by-play for every NECBL game.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2014533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2014533", "title": "Steppenwolf (comics)", "text": "Steppenwolf (comics)\n\nSteppenwolf is a fictional supervillain appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Jack Kirby and made his first appearance in \"New Gods\" #7 (February 1972). Steppenwolf (which is German for \"Steppe wolf\") is one of the New Gods, the uncle of the supervillain Darkseid, the brother of Heggra, the great-uncle of Kalibak and Orion, and a member of Darkseid's Elite.\n\nSteppenwolf is a New God who is the younger brother of Heggra and the uncle of Uxas (Darkseid). He is also a member of Darkseid's Elite. He leads the military forces of Apokolips and rides a hover bike that may be at the same level of technology as Orion's. \n\nSteppenwolf is one of the earliest survivors of Doomsday, the monster who once killed Superman. Two hundred and forty-five thousand years ago, Steppenwolf takes an Apokolips shuttle with Darkseid, Master Mayhem and a small crew to the planet of Bylan 5. The planet holds delicate natural materials Apokolips needs for weaponry, material which would be destroyed in the event of an invasion. The forcible marriage of Darkseid to the planet's princess comes to an end when Doomsday attacks. Master Mayhem is swiftly torn apart. Darkseid ignores Steppenwolf's orders to use omega beams and engages the creature in hand-to-hand combat. Steppenwolf sees that the destruction that has been wrought has doomed the planet, and all who live on it. He teleports Darkseid out of harm's way, agreeing with Darkseid not to mention this to anyone. Doomsday escapes by stowing away on the Apokolips shuttle.\n\nMost of Steppenwolf's appearances under the pen of Jack Kirby are in flashbacks: his debut, in \"New Gods\" #7, was a flashback story where he is introduced and helped Darkseid murder the wife of Darkseid's hated rival, Highfather. Highfather later tracks down and kills Steppenwolf in retaliation as the murder reignites the war between the two sides. After later showing up alive and well in the seemingly non-canon (despite Jack Kirby's involvement) 1985 \"Super Powers\" mini-series, Steppenwolf's entry in \"Who's Who in the DC Universe\" clarified that he had been resurrected by Apokoliptian technology.\n\nSteppenwolf appears later when Mister Miracle gains godlike powers over life and death. He torments Scott Free over his role in killing Scott's mother (or alleged mother figure as is claimed) and in return is physically tortured. Free ends up healing him, instead of killing him as he desires. He is sent away with Darkseid's legions.\n\nHe is seen in New Gods V2 #6, with a new costume (a Kirby redesign for the figure's Super Power action figure). Though considered a \"mockery\", Steppenwolf is given the job of running Darkseid's military forces. He is later seen fighting the Flash (Barry Allen) and the Justice League of America.\n\nIn the pages of \"Terror Titans\" #2, Steppenwolf appears as a member of the board of the Dark Side Club. He is killed by Clock King, who was using the club for gladiator fights and simple cruel amusements.\n\nWith \"The New 52\" reboot that takes place following the 2011 \"Flashpoint\" limited series, a new version of Earth-2 (home of the Justice Society of America) is introduced. In the continuity of that parallel world, Steppenwolf leads a massive invasion of the planet by Darkseid's parademons. Ultimately, Earth's heroes manage to successfully repel the invaders, but the Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman of that world are all killed in battle. Five years later, Steppenwolf is apparently hiding on Earth-2 and there is a $300 million reward for him. He is eventually killed by that world's version of Bizarro, whom Steppenwolf had employed as a soldier and indoctrinated into fighting for Apokolips.\n\nSteppenwolf also appears briefly in an issue of \"Justice League\" within \"The New 52\" taking part in the torturing of Superman on the Prime Earth. Steppenwolf is seen as support for Darkseid when he moves to attack the Anti-Monitor.\n\nSteppenwolf is an immortal with vast superhuman strength, endurance and speed, capable of lifting about one hundred tons and jumping huge distances easily. Also, he has superhuman reflexes and a high degree of invulnerability, which increases with his battle armor and allows him to resist most physical and energetic attacks. He is an experienced military leader, having served as the head of Apokolips's armed forces, and when going into battle personally often commands units of the dog cavalry - warriors riding enormous dogs, known for the carnage and mass deaths he causes when he leads forces. Steppenwolf wields several weapons, including a cable-snare in which he can entrap opponents and from which he can fire lethal radion beams. His main weapon is his electro-axe. He is a master swordsman and a formidable hand-to-hand combatant forged in hundreds of battles.\n\n\n\nMuch of Hinds' work (including backstory, motivation and character arc) was cut from the final film, something Hinds has expressed disappointment over. His design was also radically changed from \"BvS\" and original concept art.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2014537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2014537", "title": "Alvis Stalwart", "text": "Alvis Stalwart\n\nThe Stalwart, formally classified by the British Army as Truck, High Mobility Load Carrier (HMLC), 5 Ton, 6 x 6, Alvis/Stalwart and informally known by servicemen as the Stolly, is a highly mobile amphibious military truck built by Alvis that served with the British Army from 1966 until 1992.\n\nThe Stalwart was a private venture by Alvis that was adopted and entered service with the British Army in 1966 as a general transport truck in preference to the FV431, the load carrier variant of the FV430 series. It was one of the same line of vehicles that included the Alvis Saracen, Saladin and Salamander. The high mobility and amphibious capabilities were considered ideal for resupplying units in the field, particularly those of the British Army of the Rhine.\n\nThe hull is the vehicle chassis, the engine is situated under the load deck in the rear of the hull and the gearboxes with differentials and transfer boxes forward of this. The load deck is open-topped with large drop down panels on either side. Waterproof seals ensure that these will not leak when in the water. The three-person cab has the driver's position in the centre and a seat for a passenger on either side. The cab can only be entered through roof hatches.\n\nThe Stalwart can carry 5 tonnes of stores, or tow 10 tonnes.\n\nIn the water it can be driven at about 6 knots by vectored thrust water-jet propulsion units.\n\nThe drive system, which includes the all-wheel drive, multiple gearboxes, and the water propulsion units, is complex and needed a lot of maintenance. When the amphibious qualities became unnecessary, it was common for the water jets to be removed to reduce weight and maintenance.\n\nThe Stalwart's over-terrain capabilities come from the fact that the six-wheel-drive system lacks differentials, using simple bevel gears to transmit drive. A centre mounted no-spin differential allows a certain amount of slip between the two sets of wheels on each side of the vehicle on hard surfaces, but there is no allowance for rotational speed differences between front and rear. The centre no-spin unit allows the wheels on either side of the vehicle with most grip to drive when off-road. This has the effect of making the vehicle appear to crab (move from side to side) when negotiating muddy conditions, thus making the Stalwart a true six-wheel-drive vehicle, with three wheels locked together and turning at the same speed.\n\nHowever, this system causes \"wind up\" in the transmission (inter-component stress) as all the wheels are forced to rotate at the same speed, which during cornering is impossible. This led to rapid wear and breakage of the tracta joints within the drive train if the vehicle was used on firm surfaces, such as tarmac or concrete – in off-road conditions, the natural 'slip' of a loose surface, such as mud or gravel, reduced wind up. This problem is of special concern for modern-day Stalwart owners – to get a vehicle to a show requires moving it by low-loader or driving it on the road, risking damage to the transmission. Alternatively, the front and rear driveshafts can be removed, eliminating wind up at the expense of off-road capability.\n\nDuring military use, the problem of transmission wind up was solved by laying out railway sleepers (railroad ties) in a grid on flat ground and driving over them on long road moves; this allowed the transmission to unwind. On more than one occasion, servicemen drove Stalwarts into car parks and used the kerbstones separating parking bays for the same purpose. Another problem with the transmission was that the vehicle was designed to be driven loaded. Driving the vehicle unloaded caused increased wear on the drivelines to the wheels as a result of the increased angle of mesh of the joints.\n\nStalwart Mk 1 load carrier\n\nStalwart Mk 2 load carrier. This had a two-man crew although a third seat could be fitted to the right of the driver as a field modification. It could also carry 38 fully equipped troops or the Gloster SARO bulk refueling pack as alternatives to the five tonnes of cargo. The jet drive units in all the Mk 2 variants were much more efficient, giving a claimed 9 knots.\n\nThe most obvious visible difference between Mk 1 and Mk 2 variants is that the lower edges of the cab windows were now angled downwards rather than horizontal. This was to improve visibility at close-range, particularly when being marshalled by a banksman standing nearby.<br>\nA total of 970 Mk 2 FV622, FV623 and FV624 Stalwarts were produced, of which the British Army purchased 946, with 24 sold to other countries.\n\nStalwart Mk 2 limber. An artillery ammunition supply vehicle for the Abbot self-propelled gun. There was an extra seat in the cab for the crane operator plus four rear-mounted seats for a seven-man crew. An Atlas 3001/66 hydraulic crane capable of lifting three tons was added to the cargo area to lift palletised loads of ammunition. The rear crew folding seats were separated from the main cargo area by a wooden divider, and protected from inclement weather by two folding PVC hoods on metal hoops.<br>\nA total of 269 Mk 2 Stalwart limbers were produced.\n\nStalwart Mk 2 REME fitters' vehicle, based on the Mk 2 Stalwart. Two extra rear-mounted seats were added to the main cargo area for a four-man crew. An Atlas 3001 hydraulic crane capable of lifting three tons was added to the cargo area. This differed from that of the FV623 variant by having hydraulic anti-creep check valves fitted. This modified crane was more stable (and safer) for lifting and holding engine, transmission, and other heavy equipment whilst manoeuvring them into position.<br>\nA total of 60 Mk 2 Stalwart fitters' vehicles were produced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Mayo and a New Zealand father, John. When Horgan was young he played for Boyne RFC. He also played Gaelic football at Minor (U18) level with Meath. He was educated at a boys' Catholic school, St. Mary's Diocesan School in Drogheda, and was active in their rugby team. Horgan joined Lansdowne on leaving school in 1997.\n\nHorgan made his debut for Leinster in 1998. He played for Leinster 87 times in the Heineken Cup, ranking fifth in career Heineken Cup appearances. He scored 27 tries during his Heineken Cup career, ranking him fourth on the list of most career tries scored in Heineken Cup competition. His most prolific Heineken Cup season was 2004–05, when Horgan was the leading try scorer with 8 tries.\nHe was a member of a Leinster backline which included Brian O'Driscoll, Gordon D'Arcy, Denis Hickie, Felipe Contepomi, Isa Nacewa, Rob Kearney and Jonathan Sexton.\n\nHorgan made his debut for the Ireland senior side against Scotland in the 2000 Six Nations Championship, scoring a try in the process.

From 1986 to 1990 he was the Commander-in-chief of the Royal Thai Army (RTA), and Supreme Commander of the Royal Thai Armed Forces from 1987 to 1990. In 1990 he founded the New Aspiration Party which he led until 2002. He was Thailand's 22nd Prime Minister from 1996 to 1997. At various times he has held the positions of Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Minister of the Interior, Minister of Labour and Leader of the Opposition.\n\nChavalit is of Sino-Thai, Lao, and Persian descent. His father was an infantry captain. Chavalit attended Triam Udom Suksa School and graduated from Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, being appointed second lieutenant in 1953. He served in the RTA Signal Corps and completed advanced training courses at the RTA Signal Corps School, as well as at Fort Monmouth, a US Army Signal Corps School, and with the US IX Corps in Okinawa.\n\nIn 1963 he graduated from the RTA Command and General Staff College, and one year later from the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. During the 1960s and 1970s, Chavalit served in the communist insurgency suppression campaign in the jungles of Thailand, and prepared Thai soldiers for their operations in the Vietnam War. During the period after the October 1973 popular uprising, he was considered close to the \"Thahan Prachathippatai\" (\"Democratic Soldiers\") group, even though he did not openly identify as a member of the group.\n\nIn 1979, Chavalit was promoted to major-general and Director of Army Operations. Intending to outwit Communist Party of Thailand (CPT) guerillas, he created the pro-government \"Thahan Phran\" (\"hunter soldiers\"), paramilitary units who would use guerilla tactics against the CPT. They took over a significant share of the army's counterinsurgency missions by 1982. However, Chavalit believed that the communists could not be defeated by purely military means, but that combating the political, economic and social causes of the insurgency was also necessary to destroy their popular support. He helped to author cabinet orders 66/2523 (1980) and 65/2525 (1982) of Prem Tinsulanonda's government, which offered amnesty and a return to civil life to surrendering communist fighters. The orders contributed significantly to the demise of the CPT and the end of the insurgency.\n\nIn 1982, Chavalit was promoted to lieutenant-general and assistant chief-of-staff, and one year later deputy chief-of-staff of the army. Chavalit's rise to the army's top posts was unusual for a signal corps officer, as its leading positions were traditionally reserved for infantrymen, artillerymen, and \"cavalrymen\" (i.e., tankers). He owed his exceptional career partly to his close relationship to Prime Minister Prem, being one of his core supporters in the army, but also to his military, strategic, and political acumen.\n\nIn 1986 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the RTA, and one year later the supreme commander of the armed forces. Under his leadership, the army began projects for rural development. These included the \"Isan Khiao\" (\"Green Isan\") programme in the underdeveloped northeastern region, and the \"Khwam Wang Mai\" (\"New Hope\") programme in the conflict-ridden southern provinces. These projects were based on the ideas of the former \"Democratic Soldiers\" and cabinet order no. 66/2523: that economic development and relief of regional disparities involved national security, and were therefore tasks for the army. For these projects Chavalit provided large corporations with lucrative contracts, including the leading Thai agribusiness corporation Charoen Pokphand. Chavalit retired from military service in 1990, at the age of 58.\n\nChavalit began his political activity while still serving in the military. From 1984 to 1987, during the \"Semi-Democratic\" phase, he was an appointed member of the Senate. In 1987 he publicly proposed to have a prime minister directly elected by the people; he was accused of attempting to undermine the monarchy's role, temporarily discrediting his public image. In 1990 he was appointed Defence Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in the administration of Chatichai Choonhavan. During the early 1990s, Chavalit controlled 126 military-run radio stations and two of the country's five television networks. Chavalit agreed to make military stations available for an anti-AIDS campaign. He also agreed to help Meechai Viravaidya spearhead a three-year blitz to halt the spread of the disease.\n\nIn 1990, he launched his own party, the New Aspiration Party. His plan was to make it a dominant ruling party, modelled on the Golkar party of Indonesia's President Suharto. The party was backed by the Charoen Pokphand group and its chairman Dhanin Chearavanont. Chavalit used contacts from his time as army commander and head of the \"Green Isan\" programme to recruit former soldiers, civil servants, and local officials in the Northeast as members of his party.\n\nIn March 1992, Chavalit was elected a member of the House of Representatives for a constituency in Nonthaburi Province. Being the leader of the largest non-government coalition party, he was sworn in as Leader of the Opposition. He then served as Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Chuan Leekpai from 1992 to 1994, and was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence in the government of Banharn Silpa-archa from 1995 to 1996.\n\nFollowing the Royal Decree of Parliament Closure a general election was held on 17 November 1996. Chavalit's New Aspiration Party won the most seats. With the support of five coalition parties—National Development, Social Action, Thai Citizens', Liberal Integrity and Mass Party—Chavalit was appointed by royal decree as the 22nd Prime Minister of Thailand on 25 November 1996. However, during his premiership he encountered pressure from many political movements, who forced him to resign on 6 November 1997, in the midst of the Asian financial crisis.\n\nOn 14 May and 15 May 1997, the Thai baht, which was then pegged to the US dollar, was hit by massive speculative attacks. Chavalit announced he would not devalue the baht, but in July 1997 the government had no choice but to devalue the currency. This sparked the Asian financial crisis, due to the Thai government's failure to defend the baht against international speculators.\n\nAt the time, Thailand had acquired a burden of foreign debt that made the country effectively bankrupt even before the collapse of its currency.\n\nThailand's booming economy ground to a halt amidst massive layoffs in finance, real estate, and construction, resulting in huge numbers of workers returning to their villages in the countryside and 600,000 foreign workers being sent back to their home countries. The baht devalued swiftly and lost more than half of its value, and the Thai stock market dropped 75% in 1997. Due to this crisis, Chavalit stepped down in November 1997.\n\nAccording to some observers, King Bhumibol Adulyadej distrusted Chavalit as he saw him as a threat to his so-called \"network monarchy\", an informal alliance of politicians and officials favoured by the palace.\n\nChavalit then once again became Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives. The New Aspiration Party quickly lost popularity, as well as the support of the Charoen Pokphand Group, which began supporting Thaksin Shinawatra and his new Thai Rak Thai Party (TRT). After New Aspiration's electoral defeat in 2001, Chavalit abandoned it and switched over to the TRT, taking most party members and lawmakers with him. Subsequently, Chavalit served as Deputy Prime Minister responsible for internal security under Thaksin's premiership from 2001 to 2005 and as Minister of Defence from 2001 to 2002.\n\nAfter holding the position of deputy prime minister in Somchai Wongsawat's cabinet, on 7 October 2008, he resigned, admitting partial responsibility for violence because of police use of tear gas at a Parliament blockade, injuring 116 protesters. His resignation letter stated: \"Since this action did not achieve what I planned, I want to show my responsibility for this operation.\"\n\nOn 2 October 2009, Chavalit joined the Pheu Thai Party, which is composed of loyalists to Thaksin Shinawatra.

{"id": "2014561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2014561", "title": "Truck Festival", "text": "Truck Festival\n\nTruck Festival is an annual independent music festival in Oxfordshire, England. It had a record amount of tickets sold in 2019 with 25 thousand people attending. This is for the whole weekend of campers, with an additional 10 thousand people on the independent days. It was started in 1998 by the Bennett family (including the brothers Robin and Joe of the band Goldrush), who decided that mainstream festivals such as Glastonbury had become too commercial and predictable. It is held in July at Hill Farm in Steventon, which lies between Abingdon, Didcot and Wantage. The festival also gave birth to the Truck Records label in 1999.\n\nThe main stage was originally constructed from three large flatbed trucks, and a common misperception is that this is where the name of the festival comes from. However, in 2007 Robin Bennett wrote on the official Truck website: \"Contrary to popular belief, the name Truck actually came from a compilation CD I picked up, 'Ten Trucking Greats', the soundtrack of the movie \"Convoy\".\"\nTruck has grown somewhat since its inception, but with an annual attendance of around 5,000 it is dwarfed by the likes of Glastonbury (around 150,000 people) and Reading/Leeds. Part of Truck's appeal for fans is that it can be viewed as a microcosm of these larger festivals, with a similar layout and facilities but on a more manageable scale. Due to a variety of factors, chiefly the layout of Hill Farm, it is highly unlikely that Truck has any potential for significant growth in the near future.\n\nHill Farm remains very much a working farm, shutting down only temporarily to allow the festival to take place each year. One of Truck's six stages is the so-called \"Barn That Cannot Be Named\"—a cow-shed with a stage set up at one end—which, despite the rich smell of manure, remains an ever-popular place to watch bands at the festival. The Barn mainly plays host to metal, emo, hardcore and punk acts during the day, then on Saturday evening turns into an arena for drum and bass and other dance music, returning to its rock incarnation on Sunday.\n\nOther stages include Trailer Park (renamed The Village Pub in 2008), a marquee in the main arena which features the more esoteric indie bands during the day, and breakbeat on Saturday night; the Lounge (renamed the Beat Hive in 2008), a smaller marquee which used to specialise in more ambient and chilled performances during the day, and trance during the night but now plays host to a number of local, national, and international bands and DJs as well as a range of electronic music; the Market tent, which is set in the market area a short walk from the main field and features mainly folk-oriented music, becoming a retro disco/karaoke venue on Saturday night; and the Theatre/Fringe tent (renamed the Pavilion in 2008), which hosts non-musical acts such as theatrical performances, stand-up comedy, performance art and spoken-word performers.\n\nThe festival prides itself on its family atmosphere, with all of the site services being provided by local groups: the food stall is run by the local Rotary Club, and ice cream is sold by the local vicar. All profits from the festival go to charity.\n\nA compilation album is released each year on Truck Records to coincide with the festival, featuring tracks (mainly studio recordings) from various bands playing at the festival.\n\nA number of sister festivals have been launched in recent years. The annual Wood festival, at Braziers Park in Oxfordshire, was first held in 2008 and is run with an emphasis on the environment. EquiTruck has been held in January every year since 2006, at the midpoint between Truck Festivals, and is run by the Truck Festival bar staff. UniTruck was created out of the abandoned 2007 Truck Festival, which had to be moved to Oxford Brookes University at short notice. The first two festivals (in July and November 2007) were held at Oxford Brookes, followed by an event in December 2007 at Bucks New University in High Wycombe, which has become an annual event (now in November). Truck America was launched in April 2010, at the Full Moon Resort in New York City.\n\nAfter a difficult 2011, with poor ticket sales threatening the future of the festival, Robin and Joe Bennett announced they would be stepping down. The festival continued in 2012 under the management of the Y Not Festival and the event was sold out. Superstruct Entertainment, the live entertainment platform backed by Providence Equity Partners, owns the festival after it entered definitive agreement for the acquisition of several live music and entertainment festivals from Global Media & Entertainment and Broadwick Live in April 2019.\n\nWas held on 22 September 1998.\n\nNow extended to two days, Truck Two was held on the weekend of 10–11 July 1999\n\nSunday night headliners were King Prawn.

Truck Nine also abandoned the traditional early finish on Sunday night by allowing camping over two nights.\n\nTickets cost £40 for the weekend.\n\nTruck Ten was originally scheduled for 21–22 July 2007. Tickets sold out in just three days. However, due to flooding (see 2007 United Kingdom floods), the festival was postponed the day before it was due to start. A replacement event was quickly arranged at Oxford Brookes University, featuring some of the bands who were scheduled to play the festival.\n\nThe festival was rescheduled for the reserve dates of 22–23 September (the anniversary weekend of the first festival in 1998), with tickets remaining valid. Most of the original published lineup were able to return, although notable exceptions included The Brian Jonestown Massacre, Hopewell, Jack Peñate, Lethal Bizzle, Chase & Status and DJ Fresh. Oxford band Foals' set had to be rearranged after fear for safety in the Trailer Park tent. Their set on Saturday night saw them perform to a packed barn full of ecstatic truckers. The headliners were Idlewild on Sunday, and Garth Hudson (formerly of The Band) on Saturday, backed by a group including his wife Maud on lead vocals, and members of Goldrush and Grand Drive. Other artists on the bill included Glenn Tilbrook, Goldrush, Brakes, The Electric Soft Parade, John Power, Pull Tiger Tail, Metronomy and Grand Drive.

He reigned from 1881 to 1943. He was the son of Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Mukarram Shah and Wan Hajar.\n\nDuring his reign, the Sultan had asked for a $2,500,000 loan from Siam during a state financial crisis in 1905. The loan was extended with the proviso that a Financial Advisor from the court of Siam be accepted and a State Council be created to assist the Sultan in the administration of all public affairs. This resulted in the promulgation of a new constitution on 29 July 1905. The state council were run by his brothers followed by their sons. The formation of the State Council thus curbed the Sultan's administrative powers.\n\nHis reign marked the transition from Siamese suzerainty over Kedah to the British Protectorate of Unfederated Malay States following the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909.\n\nThe Sultan had several wives and partners; Che Manjelara, Che Sofiah, Sharifah Fatimah Binti Syed Idrus, Sharifah Seha Binti Syed Hussein, Che Spachendra, Sharifah Mariam and Che Laraseh. The Sultan's seventh son and twentieth child with Makche Manjelara, Tunku Abdul Rahman, who would later become the first Prime Minister of Malaysia. The Sultan was succeeded by another son, Sultan Badlishah.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSultan Abdul Hamid was responsible for the refurbishing of the \"Balai Besar\" in 1896. This building was destroyed due to attacks by the Bugis armada (1770) and Siamese (1821). The refurbishment was spearheaded by Muhammad bin Lebai Tambi, an architect with the Public Works Department of Kedah State. The wedding ceremony of the Sultan's five princes and princesses was held here in 1904 and the celebrations were carried out over a 90-day period. Besides the wedding ceremony, the Balai Besar was also used for installation ceremonies, and State Council Conferences from 1905 until 1973.\nSultan Abdul Hamid also built a new building for the \"Balai Nobat\" using concrete and metal in 1906. The architecture is the same as the previous wooden building. The height was three-story and the dome at its apex represents the Islamic element such as those found on mosques.\n\nIt was during Sultan Abdul Hamid's reign that Masjid Zahir was officially opened on Friday, 15 October 1915. The Sultan also led the Friday prayers on the auspicious day. The architecture of the mosque was inspired by the Azizi Mosque in \"Tanjung Pura\", Langkat Sultanate (present-day North Sumatra). This mosque is enhanced with five prime large domes symbolising the Five Pillars of Islam.\n\n\n\n"}

It runs on top of the Human68k disk operating system, similarly to how Windows 3.1 runs on top of MS-DOS.\n\nSX-Window was introduced for X68000 in 1989, and came preinstalled on the X68000 EXPERT model.

{"id": "2014592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2014592", "title": "Puthandu", "text": "Puthandu\n\nPuthandu (Tamil: தமிழ்ப்புத்தாண்டு), also known as Puthuvarusham or Tamil New Year, is the first day of year on the Tamil calendar and traditionally celebrated as a festival. The festival date is set with the solar cycle of the lunisolar Hindu calendar, as the first day of the Tamil month \"Chithirai\". It therefore falls on or about 14 April every year on the Gregorian calendar. The same day is observed by Hindus elsewhere as the traditional new year, but is known by other names such as Vishu in Kerala, and Vaisakhi or Baisakhi in central and northern India.\n\nOn this day, Tamil people greet each other by saying \"Puthāaṇdu vāazhthugal!\" () or \"Iṉiya puthaandu nalvāazhthugal!\" (), which is equivalent to \"Happy new year\". The day is observed as a family time. Households clean up the house, prepare a tray with fruits, flowers and auspicious items, light up the family Puja altar and visit their local temples. People wear new clothes and children go to elders to pay their respects and seek their blessings, then the family sits down to a vegetarian feast.\n\nPuthandu is also celebrated by Tamil Hindus outside Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, such as in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Reunion, Mauritius and other countries with Tamil diaspora.\n\nThe Tamil New Year follows the spring equinox and generally falls on 14 April of the Gregorian year. The day celebrates the first day of the traditional Tamil calendar and is a public holiday in both Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. The same date is observed as the traditional new year by many Hindus in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Manipur, Tripura, Bihar, Odisha, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan as well as by Hindus in Nepal and Bangladesh. Several Buddhist communities in Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Sinhalese in Sri Lanka also celebrate the same day as their new year, likely an influence of the shared culture between South and Southeast Asia in the 1st millennium CE.\n\nThere are several references in early Tamil literature to the April new year. Nakkirar, Sangam period author of the \"Neṭunalvāṭai\", wrote that the sun travels from Mesha/Chitterai through 11 successive signs of the zodiac. Kūdalūr Kizhaar refers to Mesha Raasi/Chitterai as the commencement of the year in the Puṟanāṉūṟu. The Tolkaapiyam is the oldest surviving Tamil grammar that divides the year into six seasons where Chitterai marks the start of the Ilavenil season or summer. The Silappadikaaram mentions the 12 Raasis or zodiac signs starting with Mesha/Chitterai. The Manimekalai alludes to the Hindu solar calendar as we know it today. Adiyarkunalaar, an early medieval commentator or Urai-asiriyar mentions the twelve months of the Tamil calendar with particular reference to Chitterai. There were subsequent inscriptional references in Pagan, Burma dated to the 11th century CE and in Sukhothai, Thailand dated to the 14th century CE to South Indian, often Vaishnavite, courtiers who were tasked with defining the traditional calendar that began in mid-April.\n\nTamil people celebrate Puthandu, also called Puthuvarusham, as the traditional \"Tamil/Hindu New Year\", states Peter Reeves. This is the month of Chittirai, the first month of the Tamil solar calendar, and Puthandu typically falls on 14 April. In some parts of Southern Tamil Nadu, the festival is called Chittirai Vishu. On the eve of Puthandu, a tray arranged with three fruits (mango, banana and jack fruit), betel leaves and arecanut, gold/silver jewellery, coins/money, flowers and a mirror. This is similar to the Vishu new year festival ceremonial tray in Kerala. According to the Tamil tradition, this festive tray is auspicious as the first sight upon waking on the new year day. Home entrances are decorated elaborately with colored rice powder. These designs are called kolams.\n\nIn the temple city of Madurai, the Chitterai Thiruvizha is celebrated in the Meenakshi Temple. A huge exhibition is held, called Chitterai Porutkaatchi. On the day of the Tamil New Year, a big Car Festival is held at Tiruvidaimarudur near Kumbakonam. Festivals are also held at Tiruchirapalli, Kanchipuram and other places.\nSri Lankan Tamils observe the traditional new year in April with the first financial transaction known as the Kai-vishesham. In this transaction children go to elders to pay their respect, and elders give their blessings and gift pocket money to the children in return. The event is also observed with the 'arpudu' or the first ploughing of the ground to prepare for the new agricultural cycle. The game of 'por-thenkai' or coconut wars between youth is played in villages through the Tamil north and east of the island while cart races are also held. The festive Puthandu season in April is a time for family visits and the renewal of filial bonds. It coincides with the Sinhalese new year season.\nLater in the day, families enjoy a feast. A special dish called \"Mangai-pachadi\" is prepared from a variety of flavors, similar to \"pacchadi\" of new year foods of Ugadi and Vishu. It is made from sweet jaggery, astringent mustard, sour raw mango, bitter neem, and red chilies. These complex dish is ritually tasted by Tamils, as similar multi-flavors are by Hindus elsewhere on the new year. Such traditional festive recipes, that combine different flavors, are a symbolic reminder that one must expect all flavors of experiences in the coming new year, that no event or episode is wholly sweet or bitter, experiences are transitory and ephemeral, and to make the most from them.\n\nIn Malaysia and Singapore, Tamils join Sikhs, Malayalees and Bengalis to celebrate the traditional new year in mid-April with leaders across the political spectrum wishing the ethnic Indian community for the new year. Special religious events are held in Hindu temples, in Tamil community centers and Gurdwaras. Cultural programs and media events also take place. Its a day of celebration for the Indian community.\n\nThe 2019 Tamil New Year name is தமிழ் புத்தாண்டு ஸ்ரீ விகாரி.\n\nThe Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-led Government of Tamil Nadu had declared in 2008 that the Tamil new year should be celebrated on the first day of Tamil month of Thai (14 January) coinciding with the harvest festival of Pongal. The Tamil Nadu New Year (Declaration Bill 2008) was enacted as the state law by the DMK assembly members and its Tamil Nadu Government on 29 January 2008. This law of the DMK majority-led government was subsequently rescinded by a separate act of legislation in the Tamil Nadu Assembly with an AIADMK majority-led government on 23 August 2011. Many in Tamil Nadu ignored the DMK government legislation that rescheduled the festival date, and continued the celebration of their traditional Puthandu new year festival in mid-April. The Governor and Chief Minister of the Indian Union Territory of Puducherry, which has an ethnic Tamil majority, felicitated the public for the Tamil new year in April 2010. \nThe legislative reach to change the traditional religious new year by the DMK government was questioned by Hindu priests and Tamil scholars. The law was met with resistance by Tamils in the state and elsewhere. It was also challenged in court. The then opposition All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) in Tamil Nadu subsequently condemned the decision of the DMK Government in that state and urged their supporters to continue celebrating the traditional date in mid-April. Tamils in Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia and Canada continued to observe the new year in mid-April.\n\nThe previous state government in Tamil Nadu in an effort to placate popular sentiment announced that the same day will be celebrated as a new festival renamed as \"Chithirai Tirunal\" (the festival of Chithirai). The day remained a public holiday in Tamil Nadu under the DMK government, but not as Tamil new year, but purportedly to commemorate Dr. B.R Ambedkar, who was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of Indian Constitution. All television channels in Tamil Nadu, including the pro-DMK Sun TV, continued to telecast festive \"Chithirai Tirunal Special Programs\" on 14 April 2010. The leader of the AIADMK, Jayalalitha refused to recognize the repackaged festival, and felicitated the Tamil people for the traditional Tamil New Year. The MDMK leader Vaiko, followed suit. The controversy between the two dates subsided, the official celebrations during the traditional new year in April revived and the public holiday as the Tamil New Year restored.\n\nThe Puthandu new year day is celebrated elsewhere but referred to by other names. For example, it is called Vaisakhi by Hindus and Sikhs in north and central India, which too marks the solar new year. Some examples include:\n\n\nHowever, this is not the universal new year for all Hindus. For some, such as those in and near Gujarat, the new year festivities coincide with the five-day Diwali festival. For others, the new year falls on Ugadi and Gudi Padwa, which falls a few weeks before Puthandu.\n\nThe same day every year is the new year for many Buddhist communities in parts of Southeast Asia such as Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Cambodia, likely an influence of their shared culture in the 1st millennium CE.\n\nAccording to a 1957 publication by Gunasegaram, the new year celebrated in Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Champa (Vietnam) is the Tamil New Year with roots in the practices of Mohenjo-daro (Indus Valley Civilization). According to Nanacuriyan, this may be from the medieval era Tamil influence in Southeast Asia.\n\nAccording to Jean Michaud and other scholars, the new year celebration traditions in Southeast Asian Massif have two roots. One is China, and this influence is found for example in Vietnam and southeastern China. These Sino-influenced communities celebrate the new year in the first or second lunar month after the winter solstice in December. The second group of people in the Massif celebrate the new year in mid April, much like most of India. This group consists of northeastern Indians, northeastern Myanmar, Tai speakers of Thailand, Laos, northern Vietnam and southern Yunnan. The festival is celebrated in the Massif in some ways unlike Puthandu. It is marked by an occasion to visit family and friends, splashing others with water (like Holi), drinking alcohol, as well as later wearing jewelry, new clothes and socializing. The new year festival is called regionally by different names:\n\n\n"}

The print may have been accidentally thrown away when left in the screening box overnight. Another version of the story says that Groucho Marx, unhappy with the film's quality, intentionally burned the negative after a particularly bad premiere screening.\n\n\"Humor Risk\" was directed by comedy film director Dick Smith (1886-1937), and was the first film written by Jo Swerling, who later co-wrote \"It's a Wonderful Life\", \"Gone with the Wind\" and many other films. It was filmed in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The film's title was a spoof of the Fannie Hurst drama \"Humoresque\", one of the biggest film hits of 1920.\n\nThe Marx Brothers would finally find success in motion pictures with \"The Cocoanuts\" (1929).\n\nFour of the five Marx Brothers are known to have been in this short film. Jobyna Ralston is most often mentioned as the female lead. However, some sources say that Mildred Davis—star and later wife of Harold Lloyd—was also in the film. The websites Marxology and SilentEra both state that the leading lady could have been one of two other actresses, Esther Ralston or Helen Kane.\n\nInformation about the plot of the film is sparse. It is known that the brothers were working separately, rather than as a team, and did not incorporate their trademark comic personalities for which they later became known.\n\nHarpo played the hero, a detective named Watson who \"made his entrance in a high hat, sliding down a coal chute into the basement\". Groucho played an \"old movie\" villain, who \"sported a long moustache and was clad in black\", while Chico was probably his \"chuckling [Italian] henchman\". Zeppo portrayed a playboy who was the owner of a nightclub in which most of the action took place, including \"a cabaret, [which allowed] the inclusion of a dance number\". The final shot showed Groucho \"in ball and chain, trudging slowly off into the gloaming\". Harpo, in a rare moment of romantic glory, gets the girl in the end.\n\n\n"}

He was Minister for Business and Economic Development, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Defence Support, Minister for Sport and Recreation, Minister for Essential Services, Minister for Health, Minister for Mines and Energy, Minister for Primary Industries and Fisheries and Minister for Children and Families.\n\nOn 30 July 2014, Vatskalis announced that he would be resigning from the Legislative Assembly at the end of the August sittings, which triggered a 2014 Casuarina by-election.\n\nIn the 2017 local government elections in the Northern Territory, Vatskalis was elected Lord Mayor of Darwin.\n\nVatskalis was born in Greece, and studied public health in Athens. He became involved in student politics while there, becoming a student representative at the Athens Higher Vocational School and taking part in the 1970s pro-democracy protests, where he witnessed people being arrested for speaking freely. He married an Australian woman, Linda Cotton in 1982, and in 1983, they emigrated to Western Australia. Once they had arrived in Perth, Vatskalis found that his Greek qualifications were not recognised, and was forced to start again, beginning a degree in environmental health at Curtin University, where he also joined the Labor Party. After graduating in 1985, he worked as an environmental health officer and surveyor in the Western Australian towns of Port Hedland and Wanneroo from 1986 to 1993. This period was also marked by personal tragedy, however; his wife died in 1988. In 1992, not long before leaving Western Australia, Vatskalis completed post-graduate studies this time in environmental science from Murdoch University.\n\nIn 1993, Vatskalis secured a job managing the NT Health Department's Darwin Environmental Health Unit, which meant relocating to the Northern Territory. He quickly became involved in Darwin's multicultural community, taking up a position hosting a Greek community radio show the same year, and going on to present a weekly nationwide Greek news segment on SBS Radio. Vatskalis also served a stint on the Northern Territory Police's Ethnic Advisory Committee.\n\nVatskalis left the Environmental Health Unit in 1999, taking up a position at Danila Dilba, the indigenous health service in Darwin. However, this was to be short-lived, as he soon nominated for Labor Party pre-selection to contest the seat of Casuarina at the 2001 election. Vatskalis was successful in gaining preselection, but was not widely expected to be elected. Not only had the ALP ever won Casuarina, but Vatskalis was facing incumbent MP and Arts, Sciences and Ethnic Affairs Minister Peter Adamson. However, in an unexpected result, a massive Labor wave swept through Darwin, allowing the party to win government for the first time ever. Notably, Labor took every seat in the northern portion of the capital—among them Casuarina, for the first time ever. Vatskalis took the seat on a swing of 13 percent.\n\nThough he had not even been tipped to win the seat, Vatskalis was immediately appointed to the ministry upon entering parliament, with new Chief Minister Clare Martin selecting him as her Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment, Housing, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. He sparked brief controversies in October and November, when he oversaw the sale of a large public housing complex in Alice Springs and then attempts at compulsorily acquiring homes in Berry Springs, which were dumped after a public outcry.\n\nDespite these hiccups, he was widely seen to be an effective minister, and was subsequently appointed to three additional portfolios—Transport, Infrastructure and Essential Services in a reshuffle on 16 November. He also began to win praise from several sectors over his handling of a number of issues, including opening up a large number of new housing blocks and both introducing speed limits on the Lasseter Highway and funding road repair projects in an attempt to curb the number of road deaths. He was also responsible for closing Darwin's Lake Leanyer after a coronial inquest into a death there. In February 2002, the \"Northern Territory News\" suggested that Vatskalis had \"consistently been one of the Government's better performers\", though they also criticised him for not appointing \"new blood\" to his departments. The usually conservative tabloid made similar comments in their report on the performance of the Martin ministry on the first anniversary of the election in August, suggesting that he had \"impressed observers with his willingness to confront his new responsibilities.\"\n\nIt was around this point, however, where Vatskalis' initial positive stint ended, and he began to face serious difficulties in his position. He was criticised for the sacking without explanation of one of the Territory's most senior public servants, the head of the Parks and Wildlife Service, Dr Bill Freeland, and had recurring problems surrounding the planned gas plant at Wickham Point on Darwin Harbour. As the contracts had already been signed by the Burke Country Liberal Party government, Vatskalis had little choice but to continue supporting the construction of the gas plant, despite significant pressure from angry community groups. In October 2002, Vatskalis had to be placed under police protection when he received death threats from residents angry over a decision to approve the construction of a private school in a suburban street.\n\nIn January 2003, Vatskalis—allegedly unilaterally—banned flights over the Katherine Gorge, but was forced to remove the ban less than a month later after a public outcry. He also became embroiled in a nasty stoush with the taxi industry over planned reforms, clashed with environmentalists over land-clearing around the Daly River area, and was the subject of a damaging \"A Current Affair\" report over his handling of the impact on pastoralists from the Alice Springs–Darwin Railway. These controversies were amplified by a personal scandal in August 2003, when Vatskalis was found to be offering paid translation services over the internet while an MP. Not long after, the Northern Territory media reported a number of concerns about a taxpayer-funded trip taken by Vatskalis and Chief Minister Martin in August–September.\n\nWhile he had also had some successes in this period, cracking down on antisocial behavior by youths in cars, forcing licenses upon the building industry after a series of scams, and attempting to convince the federal government to hand Kakadu National Park back to the NT government—a move soon supported by MPs on both sides of NT politics—the series of incidents throughout 2003 had severely tarnished Vatskalis' reputation.\n\nIn the December 2003 ministerial reshuffle sparked by the axing of Health Minister Jane Aagaard, Vatskalis was severely demoted, losing all his portfolios except Ethnic Affairs, and being given the new responsibilities of Mines and Energy and Primary Industries and Fisheries.\n\nAlthough the reshuffle had seen Vatskalis demoted, the new portfolios allowed him to move away from the areas in which he had been under siege. In his new portfolio, he signed several new resource exploration permits and launched several programs attempting to promote the Northern Territory to mining companies, in the hope of boosting the industry. He launched a significant shakeup of mining laws, blocked proposals to create a second mine in the Kakadu National Park, and oversaw the proposal to clean up the environmental damage from the abandoned Mount Todd gold mine, near Katherine. In 2006 he instigated the \"China and Japan Investment attraction strategy\" targeting China and Japan for the Territory's mineral resources. He led a number of delegations to China and presented the Territory's mineral wealth to mining companies and investors in China. This led to the attraction of significant investment in the mining sector by Chinese companies making China the number 1 trade partner of the territory. The success of this strategy was highlighted by the 2010 Darwin visit of the then Vice President (and current President) of China Xi Jinping.Vatskalis also won favour from the recreational fishing community, banning commercial fishing in the Adelaide River and rejecting proposals to introduce fishing licenses in the Territory.\n\nVatskalis faced his first electoral test at the 2005 election, and despite having won the seat from the CLP for the first time ever in 2001, was easily elected with a massive swing in his favour, amidst a landslide result across the Territory. He comfortably retained the seat again in 2008, albeit with a 4.2% swing against him, but still holding a 14% majority.\n\nAnother cabinet reshuffle on 4 February 2009 saw Vatskalis take the Government's Health portfolio from Dr Chris Burns while remaining the Minister for Primary Industry, Fisheries and Resources. In December 2009 he added the child protection portfolio to his duties.\n"}

The best known are those sung around the table during Shabbat and Jewish holidays. Some of the Sabbath are specific to certain times of the day, such as those sung for the Friday evening meal, the Saturday noon meal, and the third Sabbath meal just before sundown on Saturday afternoon. In some editions of the Jewish prayerbook (siddur), the words to these hymns are printed after the opening prayer (kiddush) for each meal. Other are more generic and can be sung at any meal or other sacred occasion.\n\nThe words to many are taken from poems written by various rabbis and sages during the Middle Ages. Others are anonymous folk songs that have been passed down from generation to generation. The words generally focus on the themes of the Sabbath or the specific holiday being celebrated.\n\nThe melodies vary greatly from one Jewish community to another, as local tunes and styles of music are adapted to the same liturgical poems. One famous hymn, \"Adon Olam,\" (Ruler of the Universe) has been set to countless tunes. Jews of different backgrounds enjoy sharing the various versions when they meet around the Sabbath table. New tunes continue to be written today for the same ancient lyrics. It is now rare, however, for new zemer-type lyrics to be written.\n\nThe term is used by Spanish and Portuguese Jews to refer to the sequence of psalms in the morning service, known to other communities as .\n\n\n"}

The football team plays in the first division of the Argentine football league system, the Argentine Primera División.\n\nThe club was founded on 5 May 1905, as \"Colón Foot-ball Club\" by a group of friends that were enthusiastic about football. It was named after Cristóbal Colón (Christopher Columbus), whose biography was being studied by one of the boys at the time.\n\nIn 1965 Colon won the Primera B title.\nThe first game played by Colón in Primera was v Chacarita Juniors on 6 May 1966. After the first season in the top level Colón finished 16th, but the following year the structure of Argentine football was changed so as there were two championships each season, the Metropolitano and the Nacional, with entrance to the latter originally only available to the higher placed Metropolitano teams. Colon did not qualify for the Nacional until 1968, although the squad did then managed a 6th place finish.\n\nColón finished 2nd in their group in the 1972 Nacional.\n\nIn 1975 the team made a good campaign in the Metropolitano, finishing in 6th place. This got better two years later, when Colón finished 5th in the Metropolitano, although the team then struggled in the Nacional. In 1978 Colón reached the knockout stages of the Nacional but was beaten in the quarter-finals by Independiente. \n\nColon was relegated from the Metropolitana in 1981 having won only 6 games that season It was to take 14 years for Colón to return to the top division (for the 1995–96 season). During the intervening period the team came close to promotion on a number of occasions, and lost Promotion Play-off games in 1988–89 to arch-rivals Union 3–0 on aggregate, and in 1992–93 Colón lost the championship play-off, being defeated by Banfield and then failed to qualify through the secondary play-offs. \n\nAfter a few mid-table finishes Colón was placed 2nd in the 1997 Clausura tournament, which is team's highest placed finish to date. As River Plate won both titles that season, a play-off was required between the two runners-up. In December 1997 Colón defeated Independiente 1–0 to qualify for the Copa Libertadores 1998. In the 2016-17 season, Colón drew an average home league attendance of 25,000.\n\nColon made their South American debut in the Copa CONMEBOL 1997 against Universidad de Chile. They subsequently reached the semi-finals where they lost to fellow Argentine side Lanús. \n\nThey made their debut in South America's most prestigious club tournament (Copa Libertadores) the following season. Their first game in the group stage was a 1–2 home defeat to River Plate, although they were still to qualify for the knockout stages. After beating Olimpia on penalties they were again drawn to play River Plate, but were defeated 5–2 on aggregate in the quarter-final. \n\nIn 2003, they qualified for their 3rd different continental competition (Copa Sudamericana), and they defeated Vélez Sársfield before losing to Boca Juniors.\n\nThe club's current stadium is the Estadio Brigadier General Estanislao López, which holds 33,500 spectators. The ground was inaugurated in 1946, and received a renovation in 2002.\n\n\n\n"}

The drillship was designed by Global Marine Inc. (now Transocean Inc.) specifically for a long term contract with the American National Science Foundation and University of California Scripps Institution of Oceanography and built by Levingston Shipbuilding Company in Orange, Texas. Launched on March 23, 1968, the vessel was owned and operated by the Global Marine Inc. corporation. \"Glomar Challenger\" was given its name as a tribute to the accomplishments of the oceanographic survey vessel . Glomar is a truncation of \"Global Marine\".\n\nStarting from August 1968, the ship was embarked on a 15-year-long scientific expedition, the Deep Sea Drilling Program, criss-crossing the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between South America and Africa and drilling core samples at specific locations. When the age of the samples was determined by paleontologic and isotopic dating studies, this provided conclusive evidence for the seafloor spreading hypothesis, and, consequently, for plate tectonics.\n\nDuring 1970, when doing research in the Mediterranean Sea while supervised by Kenneth Hsu, geologists aboard the vessel brought up drill cores containing gypsum, anhydrite, rock salt, and various other evaporite minerals that often form from drying of brine or seawater. These were the first solid evidence for the ancient desiccation of the Mediterranean Sea, the Messinian salinity crisis.\n\nAfter being operated for fifteen years, \"Glomar Challenger\"'s active duty was ended during November 1983 and she was later scrapped. Her successor, \"JOIDES Resolution\", was launched during 1985. The ship was a success in collecting rock samples and helped to confirm the Messinian Salinity Crisis theory.\n\n\"Glomar Challenger\" was made to help Harry Hess with the theory of Seafloor Spreading by taking rock samples confirming that the farther from the Mid-ocean ridge, the older the rock was.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The child she gave birth to was Ugayafukiaezu.\n\nAccount of Toyatama-hime and the Luck of the Mountain appear in the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Nihon Shoki\".\n\nToyotama-hime (Luxuriant-Jewel-Princess) was the daughter of the Sea-Deity Watatsumi. The palace where they reside is said to be as if made from fish scales and supposedly lies undersea.\n\nShe makes a fateful meeting with the hunter prince, named Luck of the Mountain (Yamasachi), also known as Fire-Subside (Hoori). The prince came in search of the fishing hook he lost at sea, borrowed from his elder brother Luck of the Sea (Umisachi).\n\nWhen the princess came to draw water from the well, the prince was already waiting, having climbed a \"katsura\" tree (or \"cassia\" tree) that towered above the well. The prince asked for a drink of water and made a gesture of spitting jewels into the vessel. The princess was captivated by his beauty. Her sea deity father recognized him as the descendant of the heavenly gods and arranged a banquet. Toyotama married the prince, and they lived in the place for three years.\n\nAt the end of three years, Toyotama's husband let out a sigh and revealed his unfinished quest for the lost fish hook, which needed to be returned to his brother. After the hook was found caught in the sea bream's (\"tai\" fish's) throat, Toyotama's husband was set upon a one-fathom long crocodile (or shark) to return home and, with the advice from the seagod, subjugated his elder brother.\n\nToyotama, who had accompanied her husband to the land above sea, announced her pregnancy. The prince built for her a child-delivery hut (\"parturition house\") thatched with cormorant feathers, which was not completely thatched when she went into labour. Toyotama requested her husband not watch while she gave birth to their child. Toyotama then gave birth to a son, who was named Ugayafukiaezu (\"Cormarant-Thatch-Meeting-Incompletely\") or \"Heavenly Male Brave of the Shore\". \n\nUnfortunately, Hoori's curiosity got the better of him and he attempted to spy on his wife. To his surprise, rather than seeing his wife as he knew her, he witnessed an enormous \"wani\" (crocodile, or in ancient usage also meant shark) cradling his child (one \"Nihongi\" version claim she was a dragon, \"Tatsu\"). This creature was none other than his beloved Toyotama who had shape-shifted to give birth. After catching her husband spying on her, she was utterly ashamed that he broke his promise. Unable to forgive Fire-Subside, she abandoned him and their child by returning to the sea. Following her departure, she sent her younger sister Tamayori (\"Jewel-Good\") to help raise the child in her absence. As Ugayafukiaezu grew of age, he married his aunt and eventually conceived a child, Jimmu, who became the first Emperor of Japan.\n\nSome commentators have noted a parallel between Toyotama-hime and the princess Oto-hime in the tale of \"Urashima Tarō\", the boy who saves a turtle. Toyotama rode a sea turtle to return from the sea to give birth, according to the \"Nihon Shoki\".\n\nThe transformation of Toyotama into a crocodile form draws parallels with the Melusine legend of continental Europe and selkie legends of Scotland and Scandinavia.\n\nThe extinct crocodile genus \"Toyotamaphimeia\" was named after this deity, in direct reference to this myth.\n\n\n\n\n"}

From the 2008–09 season, the stadium was renamed the Mercedes-Benz Arena, starting with a pre-season friendly against Arsenal on 30 July 2008.\n\nThe stadium was originally built in 1933 after designs by German architect Paul Bonatz. After It was built, it was named \"Adolf-Hitler-Kampfbahn\". From 1945 to 1949 it was called Century Stadium and later Kampfbahn and was used by US Troops to play baseball. The name Neckarstadion was used since 1949. It is home to VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga (and to the Stuttgarter Kickers when they played in the Bundesliga).\n\nAfter a major refurbishment in the late 1980s and early 1990s partly financed by Daimler-Benz, the Stuttgart town council dedicated the stadium to Gottlieb Daimler. The inventor had tested both the first internal combustion motorcycle and the first 4-wheel automobile there in the 1880s, on the road from Cannstatt to Untertürkheim (now called Mercedesstraße). The new museum, the headquarters and a factory of Mercedes-Benz are nearby.\n\nThe stadium capacity was reduced to around 41,000, after one stand (\"Untertürkheimer Kurve\") was demolished during summer 2009 in the process of converting it to a pure football arena. The rebuilt arena was completed in December 2011 with a new capacity of 60,000, including terracing. Due to UEFA regulations, which only allows seating, the capacity is reduced to 54,906 during international football matches.\n\nIt is divided into four sections,\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Arena features a unique fabric roof construction, making it easily recognizable. Made of precision-tailored membranes of PVC-coated polyester, the roof tissue is durable enough to withstand 1,000 kg of weight per square decimeter. It is suspended from an aesthetic steel frame that runs around the entire stadium weighing approximately 2,700 metric tons. The steel cables connecting the roof to the frame alone weigh about 420 tons. The roof was added during the refurbishment preceding the 1993 World Athletics Championships.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Arena hosted four matches of the 1974 FIFA World Cup, two matches of the 1988 UEFA European Football Championship (a 1st Round match and a semi-final) and six games of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, including a Round of 16 game and the third-place playoff match (see below for details).\n\nThe stadium also hosted the finals of the European Cup (now known as UEFA Champions League) in 1959 (Real Madrid vs. Stade de Reims) and 1988 (PSV Eindhoven vs. S.L.

The arena has also been the venue of several Eurobowl finals of American Football in the 1990s. The last athletics event took place in September 2008, after which the stadium underwent redevelopment in order to build a football-only arena.\n\nThe redevelopment was announced along with the stadium's name change in late March 2008. The first computer images of the new arena were released at the same time, also showing a large cube with four video scoreboards above the centre circle, similar to the one in the Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt.\n\nStarting in 2009, the Mercedes-Benz Arena has been redeveloped into a football-specific stadium. New stands were constructed during the summer of 2011, with pitch level being lowered by 1.30 metres in time for the beginning of the 2009–10 season. After the interior redevelopment finished, the roof was expanded to cover all the new rows of the seats.

{"id": "2014723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2014723", "title": "Kutubiyya Mosque", "text": "Kutubiyya Mosque\n\nThe Kutubiyya Mosque ( ) or Koutoubia Mosque is the largest mosque in Marrakesh, Morocco. The mosque's name is also variably rendered as Jami' al-Kutubiyah, Kutubiya Mosque, Kutubiyyin Mosque, and Mosque of the Booksellers. It is located in the southwest medina quarter of Marrakesh, near the famous public place of Jemaa el-Fna, and is flanked by large gardens.\n\nThe mosque was founded in 1147 by the Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu'min right after he conquered Marrakesh from the Almoravids. A second version of the mosque was entirely rebuilt by Abd al-Mu'min around 1158, with Ya'qub al-Mansur possibly finalizing construction of the minaret around 1195. This second mosque is the structure that stands today. It is considered a classic and important example of Almohad architecture and of Moroccan mosque architecture generally. The minaret tower, in height, is decorated with varying geometric arch motifs and topped by a spire and metal orbs. It likely inspired other buildings such as the Giralda of Seville and the Hassan Tower of Rabat, which were built shortly after in the same era. The minaret is also considered an important landmark and symbol of Marrakesh.\n\nThe mosque is located about west of the city’s the Jemaa El Fna souq, a prominent market place which has existed since the city's establishment. It is situated on the Avenue Mohammed V, opposite Place de Foucauld. During French occupation, the network of roads was developed with the mosque as the central landmark, in the \"ville nouvelle\". To the west and south of the mosque is a notable rose garden, and across Avenue Houmman-el-Fetouaki is the small mausoleum of the Almoravid emir Yusuf ibn Tashfin, one of the great builders of Marrakesh, consisting of a simple crenelated structure.\n\nIn the mosque's esplanade, which backs onto Jemaa el Fna, the ruins of the first Kutubiyya Mosque can be seen. A part of the perimeter of the Ksar al-Hajjar, the original stone fortress built in 1070 by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, the Almoravid founder of the city, was also uncovered on the northern side of the original mosque. Also visible today at the northeast corner of these ruins is a part of \"Bab 'Ali\", the monumental stone gate of Ali ibn Yusuf's former palace which was completed in 1126 next to the fortress before being demolished by the Almohads to make way for their new mosque.\n\nAlso on the same esplanade is a small white domed building, the Koubba (or Qubba) of Lalla Zohra. This is the tomb of Fatima Zohra bint al-Kush (also called Lalla Zohra), a female mystic who died in the early 17th century and was buried here near the mosque.\n\nAll the names and spellings of Kutubiyya Mosque, including Jami' al-Kutubiyah, Kotoubia, Kutubiya, and Kutubiyyin, are based on the Arabic word \"kutubiyyin\" (), which means \"booksellers\". The Koutoubia Mosque, or Bookseller's Mosque, reflects the honorable bookselling trade practiced in the nearby souk. At one time as many as 100 book vendors worked in the streets at the base of the mosque.\n\nThe city of Marrakesh was founded around 1070 by the Almoravid dynasty to be their capital, but was captured in 1147 by the Almohads under their leader Abd al-Mu'min. While the Almohads decided to make Marrakesh their capital too, they did not want any trace of religious monuments built by the Almoravids, their staunch enemies, as they considered them heretics. They reportedly demolished all the mosques in the city, including the main mosque, the Ben Youssef Mosque, arguing that the Almoravid mosques were not aligned with the proper \"qibla\" (direction of prayer).\n\nSince the former Almoravid grand mosque (i.e. the original Ben Youssef Mosque) was already closely integrated into the surrounding urban fabric, it was not practical for the Almohads to rebuild an entirely new mosque with a significantly different orientation on the same site. It's possible that they did not even demolish the mosque but merely left it derelict. The Almohads may have also wished to have the city's main mosque located closer to the kasbah and royal palaces, as was common in other Islamic cities. As a result, Abd al-Mu'min decided to build the new mosque right next to the former Almoravid kasbah, the Ksar el-Hajjar, which became the site of the new Almohad royal palace, located west of the city's main square (what is today the Jemaa el-Fnaa).\n\nThe issue of the qibla alignement of the Kutubiyya and other Almohad mosques (and even of medieval Islamic mosques generally) is a complex one which is often misunderstood. The justification given by the Almohads for the destruction of existing Almoravid mosques was that their qibla was aligned too far to the east, which the Almohads judged to be incorrect as they preferred a tradition that existed in the western Islamic world (the Maghreb and al-Andalus) according to which the qibla should be oriented towards the south instead. This alignment was actually further away from the \"true\" qibla which points directly towards Mecca and which is used in modern mosques everywhere today. Qibla orientations varied throughout the medieval period of Morocco but the Almohads generally followed an orientation between 154° and 159° (numbers expressed as the azimuth from the true north), whereas the \"true\" qibla (i.e. the exact direction of Mecca) in Marrakesh is 91° (nearly due east). This true qibla was eventually adopted in modern times and is evident in more recent mosques including the current Ben Youssef Mosque which was rebuilt in 1819 with a qibla of 88° (slightly too far north but very close). \n\nThe Almohad qibla was similar to the qibla orientation of the Great Mosque of Cordoba and the Qarawiyyin Mosque of Fes, both founded at an early period in the late 8th to early 9th centuries. This traditional qibla was based on a saying (\"hadith\") of the Prophet Muhammad which stated that \"What is between the east and west is a qibla\" (most likely in reference to his time in Medina, north of Mecca), which thus legitimized southern alignments. This practice may also have sought to emulate the orientation of the walls of the rectangular \"Kaaba\" building inside the Great Mosque of Mecca, based on another tradition which considered the different sides of the Kaaba as being associated with different parts of the Muslim world. In this tradition the northwest face of the Kaaba was associated with al-Andalus and, accordingly, the Great Mosque of Cordoba was oriented towards the southeast as if facing the Kaaba's northwestern facade, with its main axis parallel to the main axis of the Kaaba structure (which was oriented from southeast to northwest). This architectural alignment was typically achieved by using astronomical alignments to reproduce the appropriate orientation of the Kaaba itself, whose minor axis is aligned with the direction of sunrise at the summer solstice.\n\nThat being said, medieval Muslims did in fact possess sufficient mathematical knowledge to calculate a reasonably accurate \"true\" qibla pointing directly towards Mecca. A more easterly qibla orientation (which points approximately towards Mecca) was already evident in the royal mosque of Madinat al-Zahra (just outside Cordoba) built later in the 10th century, as well as in the orientation of the original Almoravid Ben Youssef Mosque (founded in 1126), estimated to be 103°. The Almohads, who rose to power after these periods, apparently chose a qibla orientation which they saw as more ancient or traditional, or as emulating the prestigious Great Mosque of Cordoba. Whether their interpretation of the qibla was a true and rigorously followed directive or a mostly symbolic argument to differentiate themselves from the Almoravids is still questioned by scholars.\n\nAbd al-Mu'min began construction of the first Kutubiyya Mosque in 1147, the same year that he had conquered the city. Adjoined to the walls of the former Almoravid kasbah, the mosque may have also been built on top of some of the former Almoravid palace's annexes and maybe even over a royal cemetery or mausoleum. The date of the first mosque's completion is unconfirmed, but is estimated by historians to have been around 1157, when it is known with some certainty that prayers were conducted in the mosque. It was in 1157 that a celebrated copy of the Qur'an attributed to the hand of Caliph Uthman, previously kept in the Great Mosque of Cordoba, was transferred to the mosque. Abd al-Mu'min also transferred to his mosque the famous Almoravid minbar of the Ben Youssef Mosque, originally commissioned by Ali ibn Yusuf from a workshop in Cordoba. \n\nThe mosque was likely connected to the adjacent royal palace via a passage (\"sabat\") which allowed the Almohad caliph to enter the mosque directly from his palace without having to pass through the public entrances (not unlike a similar passage which existed between the caliph's palace and the Great Mosque of Cordoba). This passage likely passed through the imam's chamber behind the southeastern qibla wall and therefore may have disappeared when the second mosque was built over this area. Modern archeological excavations have also confirmed the existence in the first Kutubiyya Mosque of a near-legendary mechanism which allowed the wooden \"maqsura\" (a screen separating the caliph and his entourage from the rest of the crowd during prayers) to rise from a trench in the ground seemingly by itself, and then retract in the same manner when the caliph left. Another semi-automated mechanism also allowed the minbar to emerge and move forward from its storage chamber (next to the \"mihrab\") seemingly by itself. The exact functioning of the mechanism is unknown, but may have relied on a hidden system of counterweights.\n\nThe new Almohad mosque was thus imbued with great political and religious symbolism, being closely associated with the ruling dynasty, and makes subtle references to the ancient Ummayyad caliphate in Cordoba, whose great mosque was a model for much of subsequent Moroccan and Moorish architecture. It is unknown if the first Kutubiyya Mosque had a minaret, though some historians have suggested that a former bastion of the Almoravid kasbah (Ksar el-Hajjar) on the mosque's northeastern corner may have been converted into the mosque's first minaret, whose remains might have been visible even as late as the beginning of the 19th century. \n\nIt is unclear when exactly the first Kutubiyya Mosque disappeared, but its layout is well-known thanks to modern excavations starting in 1923. The excavated foundations of the mosque, as well as the outline of its mihrab and qibla wall, are still visible today on the current mosque's northwestern side. Also visible today nearby are the uncovered vestiges of the Ksar el-Hajjar to which the mosque was adjoined.\n\nAt some point, Abd al-Mu'min decided to build a second mosque directly adjoined to the southeastern (qibla) side of the first mosque. The reasons for this unusual decision are still not fully understood. The main historical narratives assert that Abd al-Mu'min discovered, possibly during its construction, that the initial mosque was misaligned with the qibla (presumably according to Almohad criteria). The second mosque is indeed aligned slightly further to the south, at an azimuth of 159° or 161° from the true north, compared to the 154° alignment of the first mosque. This actually makes the second mosque 5 to 7 degrees further out of alignment with respect to the \"true\" qibla (the direction of Mecca). Why this slightly different alignment was preferred is unclear; it may be that the first mosque was aligned with the walls of the Ksar el-Hajjar and that this was judged sufficient at the time, but that the alignment of the second mosque more closely matched that of the Tinmal Mosque (an important Almohad religious site) which had been built in the meantime. In practice, the alignment problem could have been a minor issue as devotees could always adjust the direction when offering prayers in the hall. Other possible motivations for the construction of the second mosque may have been to accommodate a growing population, to double the building's size to make it more impressive, or even as an excuse to make one of the mosques exclusive to the ruling elites while the other was used by the general population.\n\nThe construction dates of the second mosque are also not firmly established. One historical chronicle, reported by al-Maqqari, claims that construction began on the second mosque in May 1158 (Rabi' al-Thani 553 AH) and was completed with the inauguration of the first Friday prayers in September (Sha'ban) of the same year. However, this construction period seems implausibly short and it is likely that construction either began before May 1158 or (perhaps more likely) continued after September 1158. As mentioned, it is not known when the first mosque was actually deserted, or even whether it was abandoned and allowed to deteriorate or if it was consciously demolished at some point. It is believed that the two mosques may have initially coexisted as one large mosque. Gaston Deverdun, in his heavily-cited 1959 book on the history of Marrakesh, suggested the possibility that the first mosque was only abandoned after Ya'qub al-Mansur built a new royal citadel (the current Kasbah district) further south. As part of this citadel, al-Mansur had also raised a new Kasbah Mosque, completed in 1190, which subsequently served as the main mosque of the caliph and the ruling elites. This would have thus made the old Kutubiyya less useful, particularly the first mosque (which was attached to the former, now abandoned, citadel). It is even possible that the first Kutubiyya was dismantled in order to reuse its materials in the construction of the new kasbah and its mosque.\n\nThe famous minaret of the mosque, which is visible today, is also not conclusively dated. Some historical sources attribute it to Abd al-Mu'min (who reigned up until 1163) while others attribute it to Ya'qub al-Mansur (who reigned between 1184 and 1199). According to some historians (including Deverdun), the most likely scenario is that the minaret was begun before 1158 and largely built by Abd al-Mu'min, or at the very least designed on his commission. It is plausible, however, that Ya'qub al-Mansur either finished the work in his time, or that he added the small secondary \"lantern\"-tower at its summit in 1195. \n\nThe second Kutubiyya Mosque was built almost identical to the first except for its adjusted orientation. The layout, architectural designs, dimensions and materials used for construction were almost all the same. The only architectural differences are in a few details and in the fact that the second mosque was slightly wider than the first. The mosque's floor plan is also slightly irregular due to the fact that its northern wall is still the old southern wall of the first mosque, which is at a slightly different angle from the second mosque (due to the different qibla orientation, as explained above). The mosque, and more specifically its minaret, was the forerunner of two other structures built on the same pattern, the \"Tour Hassan\" in Rabat (a monumental mosque begun by Ya'qub al-Mansur but never finished) and the Great Mosque of Seville, Spain, whose minaret is preserved as the Giralda. This structure thus became one of the models for subsequent Moroccan-Andalusian architecture.\n\nToday, the mosque is still active and non-Muslims are not allowed inside. However, it is possible to visit the Tin Mal Mosque, built along the same lines, which is inactive but preserved as a historic site south of Marrakesh.\n\nArchitectural details of the first mosque and the new mosque are almost identical except for the orientation. Hence, what is true of one holds true for the other, though the first mosque is now only visible as archaeological remains. The mosque is a characteristic Almohad design, and its various elements resemble those of many other mosques from the same period.\nThe mosque is located in a large plaza with gardens, and is floodlit at night. The building, of bricks and sandstone, measures in width towards the east and to the west along a north to south direction. Brick work is found in the columns, arcades, middle of the qibla wall, and niche of the mihrab. Sandstone is used for the external walls built in the southern, eastern and western directions. The stone wall on the northern side of the first mosque abutted the old Almoravid fortress wall (the \"Ksar el-Hajjar\"). The surfaces are enlivened by simple designs. All window sections have horseshoe-shaped and multifoil arches, arranged within a rectangle. A diamond shape is formed in the upper part as result of overlapping arches in woven design. Faience strips are provided with bricks in turquoise colour projecting out of the wall, in smaller decorative forms. Austere kufic script is also seen. The sahn or courtyard is wide, the same width as the nine central naves. There is an ablution fountain at the center of the courtyard. There are four entrances to the mosque, of which three open directly into the prayer hall while one opens into the courtyard. There is also an additional public entrance to the sahn from the north wall, along the central axis. The front elevation faces the street where book shops were located, hence the name \"Booksellers' Mosque\". There are two other private entrances to the mosque, one for the imam on the left side of the mihrab and the other for the Prince to enter directly into the maqsura.\n\nThe main prayer hall is a hypostyle hall with more than 100 pillars which support horseshoe-shaped arches along the parallel naves. The hall is large, to the south, and abuts the courtyard at its northern end. It is also a \"T\"-shape prayer hall, in that the nave along the qibla wall and the perpendicular central nave leading towards the mihrab are wider than other naves. The mihrab niche is on the qibla wall in the prayer hall along the widened central nave, for which entry is from the courtyard. There is a wide transverse nave that is aligned along the qibla wall at the south end of the prayer hall. Three wide central naves are aligned perpendicular to the hall to the north. The central naves are flanked by seven smaller parallel naves. In all, there are seventeen parallel naves. The longitudinal naves, about in length, are six times the width of the large transverse nave. The extensions of these naves are from the four outermost naves on either side of the prayer hall annexes and the courtyard.\n\nThe minaret is designed in Almohad style and was constructed of sandstone. It was originally covered with Marrakshi pink plaster, but in the 1990s, experts opted to expose the original stone work and removed the plaster. The minaret tower is in height, including the spire, itself tall. Each side of the square base is in length. The minaret is visible from a distance of . Its prominence makes it a landmark structure of Marrakesh, which is maintained by an ordinance prohibiting any high rise buildings (above the height of a palm tree) to be built around it. The mu'azzin calling the faithful for the \"adhan\" (prayer), is given from the four cardinal directions at the top of the minaret.\n\nIts design includes a high angular shaft with a smaller but identical superstructure resting on it, topped by a dome. Many features of the minaret are also included in other religious buildings in the country, such as a wide band of ceramic tiles, alternate pattern work on each side, and Moorish-styled scalloped keystone arches. Decorative carvings envelop the arched fenestrations. These carved compositions also originally featured polychrome painted decoration of geometric and plant motifs, of which only traces remain today. Above four-fifths of its height, the minaret has stepped merlons capping the perimeter of the main shaft, at which level there is an outdoor gallery approached by ramps. Inside the tower are six rooms in succession, one above the other, and the whole tower could be ascended via a wide interior ramp that allowed the mu'azzin to ride a horse to the top. Each exterior facade of the tower is designed differently as the window openings are arranged at different heights, conforming to the ascending ramp inside. The chambers inside are also enlivened with varying degrees of decoration, with the topmost (sixth) chamber being especially notable for its ornamental ribbed dome ceiling (similar to the domes of the Great Mosque of Cordoba) with \"muqarnas\" squinches and geometric patterns. \n\nThe minaret is topped by a spire. The spire includes gilded copper balls, decreasing in size towards the top, a traditional style of Morocco. There are multiple legends about the orbs. One such legend states that the globes were originally made of pure gold, and there were at one time only three of them, the fourth having been donated by the wife of Yaqub al-Mansur as penance for breaking her fast for three hours one day during Ramadan. She had her golden jewelry melted down to form the fourth globe. Another version of the legend is that the balls were originally made entirely of gold fashioned from the jewellery of the wife of Saadian Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur. There is a flag pole next to the copper balls forming the spire, which is used for hoisting the religious green flag of the Prophet, which the mu'azzin does every Friday and on religious occasions. The floodlit tower has pleasant views at night.\n\nThe Kutubiyya Mosque's original \"minbar\" (pulpit) was commissioned by Ali ibn Yusuf, one of the last Almoravid rulers, and created by a workshop in Cordoba, Spain (al-Andalus). Its production started in 1137 and is estimated to have taken seven years. It is regarded as “one of the unsurpassed creations of Islamic art”. Its artistic style and quality was hugely influential and set a standard which was repeatedly imitated, but never surpassed, in subsequent minbars across Morocco and parts of Algeria. It is believed that the minbar was originally placed in the first Ben Youssef Mosque (named after Ali ibn Yusuf, but entirely rebuilt in later centuries). It was then transferred by the Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min to the first Kutubiyya Mosque and was later moved to the second incarnation of that mosque. It remained there until 1962, when it was moved to the El Badi Palace where it is now on display for visitors.\n\nThe minbar is an essentially triangular structure with the hypotenuse side occupied by a staircase with nine steps. It is long, wide, and tall. The main structure is made in North African cedar wood, although the steps were made of walnut tree wood and the minbar's base was made with fir tree wood. The surfaces are decorated through a mix of marquetry and inlaid sculpted pieces. The large triangular faces of the minbar on either side are covered in an elaborate and creative motif centered around eight-pointed stars, from which decorative bands with ivory inlay then interweave and repeat the same pattern across the rest of the surface. The spaces between these bands form other geometric shapes which are filled with panels of deeply-carved arabesques, made from different coloured woods (boxwood, jujube, and blackwood). There is a wide band of Quranic inscriptions in Kufic script on blackwood and bone running along the top edge of the balustrades. The other surfaces of the minbar feature a variety of other motifs. Notably, the steps of the minbar are decorated with images of an arcade of Moorish (horseshoe) arches inside which are curving plant motifs, all made entirely in marquetry with different colored woods.\n\nHistorical accounts describe a mysterious semi-automated mechanism in the Kutubiyya Mosque by which the minbar would emerge, seemingly on its own, from its storage chamber next to the mihrab and move forward into position for the imam's sermon. Likewise, the \"maqsura\" of the mosque (a wooden screen that separated the caliph and his entourage from the general public during prayers) was also retractable in the same manner and would emerge from the ground when the caliph attended prayers at the mosque, and then retract once he left. This mechanism, which elicited great curiosity and wonder from contemporary observers, was designed by an engineer from Malaga named Hajj al-Ya'ish, who also completed other projects for the caliph. Modern archaeological excavations carried out on the first Kutubiyya Mosque have found evidence confirming the existence of such a mechanism, though its exact workings are not fully established. One theory, which appears plausible from the physical evidence, is that it was powered by a hidden system of pulleys and counterweights.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2014725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2014725", "title": "Peter Heywood", "text": "Peter Heywood\n\nPeter Heywood (6 June 1772 – 10 February 1831) was a British naval officer who was on board during the mutiny of 28 April 1789. He was later captured in Tahiti, tried and condemned to death as a mutineer, but subsequently pardoned. He resumed his naval career and eventually retired with the rank of post-captain, after 29 years of honourable service.\n\nThe son of a prominent Isle of Man family with strong naval connections, Heywood joined \"Bounty\" under Lieutenant William Bligh at the age of 15. Although unranked, he was granted the privileges of a junior officer. \"Bounty\" left England in 1787 on a mission to collect and transport breadfruit from the Pacific, and arrived in Tahiti late in 1788. Relations between Bligh and certain of his officers, notably Fletcher Christian, became strained, and worsened during the five months that \"Bounty\" remained in Tahiti.\n\nShortly after the ship began its homeward voyage, Christian and his discontented followers seized Bligh and took control of the vessel. Bligh and 18 loyalists were set adrift in an open boat; Heywood was among those who remained with \"Bounty\". Later, he and 15 others left the ship and settled in Tahiti, while \"Bounty\" sailed on, ending its voyage at Pitcairn Island. Bligh, after an epic open-boat journey, eventually reached England, where he implicated Heywood as one of the mutiny's prime instigators. In 1791, Heywood and his companions were met in Tahiti by the search vessel and held in irons for transportation to England. Heywood and one other sailor welcomed the \"Pandora\" in canoes, relieved to be rescued. However, they were arrested; the captain, Edward Edwards, had them and 12 others fettered and handcuffed in an box built for the purpose on deck. During their subsequent journey, \"Pandora\" was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef. Four of Heywood's fellow prisoners were drowned; Heywood survived.\n\nIn September 1792, Heywood was court-martialed and with five others was sentenced to hang. However, the court recommended mercy for Heywood, and King George III pardoned him. In a rapid change of fortune, he found himself favoured by senior officers, and after the resumption of his career, received a series of promotions that gave him his first command at the age of 27 and made him a post-captain at 31. He remained in the navy until 1816, building a respectable career as a hydrographer, and then enjoyed a long and peaceful retirement. The extent of Heywood's true guilt in the mutiny has been clouded by contradictory statements and possible false testimony. During his trial powerful family connections worked on his behalf, and he later benefited from the Christian family's generally fruitful efforts to demean Bligh's character and present the mutiny as an understandable reaction to an unbearable tyranny. Contemporary press reports, and more recent commentators, have contrasted Heywood's pardon with the fate of his fellow prisoners who were hanged, all lower-deck sailors without wealth or family influence and who lacked legal counsel.\n\nPeter Heywood was born in 1772 at the Nunnery, in Douglas, Isle of Man. He was the fifth of the 11 children (six boys and five girls) of Peter John Heywood and his wife Elizabeth Spedding. The Heywood ancestry can be traced back to the 12th century; a prominent forebear was Peter \"Powderplot\" Heywood, who arrested Guy Fawkes after the 1605 plot to blow up the English parliament. On his mother's side Peter was distantly related to Fletcher Christian's family, which had been established on the Isle of Man for centuries. In 1773, when Peter was a year old, Peter John Heywood was forced by a financial crisis to sell The Nunnery and leave the island. The family lived for several years in Whitehaven, England before the father's appointment as agent for the Duke of Atholl's Manx properties brought them back to Douglas.\n\nHeywood's family had a tradition of naval and military service. In 1786, at the age of 14, Heywood left St Bees School in England to join , a harbour-bound training vessel at Plymouth. In August 1787, Heywood was offered a berth on the \"Bounty\", for an extended cruise to the Pacific Ocean under the command of Lieutenant William Bligh. Heywood's recommendation came from Richard Betham, a family friend who was also Bligh's father-in-law. The Heywood family at this time was in deep financial trouble, Peter John Heywood having been dismissed by the Duke for gross mismanagement and embezzlement of funds. Betham wrote to Bligh: \"his Family have fallen into a great deal of Distress on account of their father losing the Duke of Atholl's business\", and urged Bligh not to desert them in their adversity. Bligh was happy to oblige his father-in-law, and invited the young Heywood to stay with him in Deptford while the ship was prepared for the forthcoming voyage.\n\n\"Bounty's\" mission was to collect breadfruit plants from Tahiti, for transportation to the West Indies as a new source of food for the slave plantations. Bligh, a skilled navigator, had travelled to Tahiti in 1776, as Captain James Cook's sailing master during the explorer's final voyage. \"Bounty\" was a small vessel, in overall length, with a complement of 46 men crammed into limited accommodation. Heywood was one of several \"young gentlemen\" aboard ship who were mustered as able seamen but ate and slept with their social equals in the cockpit. His distant kinsman Fletcher Christian served as master's mate on the voyage. Bligh's orders were to enter the Pacific by rounding Cape Horn. After collecting sufficient breadfruit plants from the Tahitian islands he was to sail westward, through the Endeavour Strait and across the Indian Ocean. Entering the Atlantic he would continue on to the West Indies, incidentally completing a circumnavigation.\n\n\"Bounty\" left London on 15 October 1787, and after being held at Spithead awaiting final sailing orders was further delayed by bad weather; it was 23 December before the ship was finally away. This long hiatus caused \"Bounty\" to arrive at Cape Horn much later in the season than planned and to encounter very severe weather. Unable to make progress against westerly gales and enormous seas, Bligh finally turned the ship and headed east. He would now have to take the alternative, much longer route to the Pacific, sailing first to Cape Town and then south of Australia and New Zealand, before working northwards to Tahiti.\n\nFollowing its new route, \"Bounty\" reached Cape Town on 24 May 1788. Here, Heywood wrote a long letter to his family describing the voyage to date, with vivid descriptions of life at sea. Initially, Heywood relates, sailing had been \"in the most pleasurable weather imaginable\". In describing the attempts to round Cape Horn he writes: \"I suppose there never were seas, in any part of the known world, to compare with those we met ... for height, and length of swell; the oldest seamen on board never saw anything to equal that ...\" Bligh's decision to turn east was, Heywood records, \"to the great joy of everyone on board\". Historian Greg Dening records a story, unmentioned in Heywood's letter, that at the height of the Cape Horn storms Bligh had punished Heywood for some minor wrongdoing by ordering him to climb the mast and to \"stay there beyond the point of all endurance\"; this, Dening concedes, was possibly a later fabrication to discredit Bligh.\n\n\"Bounty\" sailed from Cape Town on 1 July 1788, reached Tasmania on 19 August 1788, and arrived at Matavai Bay, Tahiti, on 26 October 1788. The latter stages of this voyage, however, saw signs of trouble between Bligh and his officers and crew; rows and disagreements grew steadily more frequent. On arrival, Heywood and Christian were assigned to a shore camp which would act as a nursery for the breadfruit plants. They would live here throughout the Tahiti sojourn, a \"situation of comfort and privilege\" which, according to historian Richard Hough, was much envied by those required to spend their nights on the ship. Whether crew were ashore or on board, however, duties during \"Bounty's\" five months' stay in Tahiti were relatively light. Some men took regular partners from the native women, while others led promiscuous lives; both Christian and Heywood are listed among the officers and men treated for venereal infections.\n\nDespite the relaxed atmosphere, relations between Bligh and his men, and particularly between Bligh and Christian, continued to deteriorate. Christian was routinely humiliated by the captain—often in front of the crew and the native Tahitians—for real or imagined slackness, while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment. Floggings, rarely administered during the outward voyage, now became a common occurrence; as a consequence, three men deserted the ship. They were quickly recaptured, and a search of their belongings revealed a list of names which included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh confronted the pair and accused them of complicity in the desertion plot, which they strenuously denied; without further corroboration Bligh could not act against them.\n\nAs the date for departure from Tahiti grew closer, Bligh's outbursts against his officers became more frequent. One witness reported that \"Whatever fault was found, Mr Christian was sure to bear the brunt.\" Tensions rose among the men, who faced the prospect of a long and dangerous voyage that would take them through the uncharted Endeavour Strait, followed by many months of hard sailing. Bligh was impatient to be away, but in Hough's words he \"failed to anticipate how his company would react to the severity and austerity of life at sea ... after five dissolute, hedonistic months at Tahiti\". On 5 April 1789, \"Bounty\" finally weighed anchor and made for the open sea.\n\nFor three weeks, \"Bounty\" sailed westward, and early on 28 April 1789 was lying off the island of Tofua in the Friendly Islands (Tonga). Christian was officer of the watch; Bligh's behaviour towards him had grown increasingly hostile, and Christian was now prepared to take over the ship, with the help of a group of armed seamen who were willing to follow him. Shortly after 5:15 am local time (05:15), Bligh was seized and brought on deck, naked from the waist down, wearing only his nightshirt, and with his hands bound. There followed hours of confusion as the majority of the crew sought to grasp the situation and decide how they should react. Finally, at about 10 am (10:00), Bligh and 18 loyalists were placed in the ship's launch, a open boat, with minimal supplies and navigation instruments, and cast adrift. Heywood was among those who remained on board.\n\nNot all the 25 men who remained on \"Bounty\" were mutineers; Bligh's launch was overloaded, and some who stayed with the ship did so under duress. \"Never fear, lads, I'll do you justice if ever I reach England\", Bligh is reported as saying. With regard to Heywood, however, Bligh was convinced that the young man was as guilty as Christian. Bligh's first detailed comments on the mutiny are in a letter to his wife Betsy, in which he names Heywood ( a mere boy not yet 16) as \"one of the ringleaders\", adding: \"I have now reason to curse the day I ever knew a Christian or a Heywood or indeed a Manks man. Bligh's later official account to the Admiralty lists Heywood with Christian, Edward Young and George Stewart as the mutiny's leaders, describing Heywood as a young man of abilities for whom he had felt a particular regard. To the Heywood family Bligh wrote: \"His baseness is beyond all description.\"\nMembers of the crew would later provide conflicting accounts of Heywood's actions during the mutiny. Boatswain William Cole testified that Heywood had been detained on the ship against his will. Ship's carpenter William Purcell thought that Heywood's ambiguous behaviour during the critical hours—he had been seen unwittingly resting his hand on top of a cutlass—was due to his youth and the excitement of the moment, and that he had no hand in the uprising itself. On the other hand, Midshipman John Hallett reported that Bligh, with a bayonet at his breast and his hands tied, had addressed a remark to Heywood who had \"laughed, turned round and walked away\". Another midshipman, Thomas Hayward, claimed he had asked Heywood his intentions and been told by the latter that he would remain with the ship, from which Hayward assumed that his messmate had sided with the mutineers.\n\nAfter the departure of Bligh's launch, Christian turned \"Bounty\" eastward in search of a remote haven on which he and the mutineers could settle. He had in mind the island of Tubuai, south of Tahiti, partly mapped by Cook. Christian intended to pick up women, male servants and livestock from Tahiti, to help establish the settlement. As \"Bounty\" sailed slowly towards Tubuai, Bligh's launch, overcoming many dangers and hardships, made its way steadily towards civilisation and reached Coupang (now Kupang), on Timor, on 14 June 1789. Here Bligh gave his first report of the mutiny, while awaiting a ship to take him back to England.\n\nA month's sailing brought \"Bounty\" to Tubuai on 28 May 1789. Despite a hostile reception from the island's natives Christian spent several days surveying the land and selecting a site for a fort before taking \"Bounty\" on to Tahiti. When they reached Matavai Bay Christian concocted a story that he, Bligh and Captain Cook were founding a new settlement at Aitutaki. Cook's name ensured generous gifts of livestock and other goods, and on 16 June the well-provisioned \"Bounty\" sailed back to Tubuai with nearly 30 Tahitians, some of whom had been taken aboard by deception. The attempt to establish a colony on Tubuai was unsuccessful; the repeated raids by the mutineers for \"wives\" and the near-mutinous dissatisfaction of the duped Tahitians wrecked Christian's plans.\n\nOn 18 September 1789, \"Bounty\" sailed back to Matavai Bay for the final time. Heywood and 15 others now decided that they would remain in Tahiti and risk the consequences of discovery, while Christian, with eight mutineers and a number of Tahitian men and women, took off in \"Bounty\" for an unrevealed destination. Before departing, Christian left messages for his family with Heywood, recounting the story of the mutiny and emphasising that he alone was responsible.\n\nOn Tahiti Heywood and his companions set about organising their lives. The largest group, led by James Morrison, began building a schooner, to be named \"Resolution\" after Cook's ship. Matthew Thompson and former master-at-arms Charles Churchill chose to lead drunken and generally dissolute lives which ended in the violent deaths of both. Heywood preferred quiet domesticity in a small house with a Tahitian wife, studying the Tahitian language and fathering a daughter. Over a period of 18 months (from September 1789 through 1790 to March 1791), he gradually adopted native manners of dress, and was heavily tattooed around the body. Heywood later explained: \"I was tattooed not to gratify my own desires, but theirs\", adding that in Tahiti a man without tattoos was an outcast. \"I always made it a maxim when I was in Rome to act as Rome did.\"\n\nWhat Dening describes as an \"arcadian existence\" ended on 23 March 1791, with the arrival of the search ship . Heywood's first reaction to the ship's appearance was, he later wrote, \"the utmost joy\". As the ship anchored, he rode out in a canoe to identify himself. However, his reception, like that of the others who came aboard voluntarily, was frosty. Captain Edward Edwards, \"Pandora's\" commander, made no distinctions among the former \"Bounty\" men; all became prisoners, and were manacled and taken below.\n\nWithin a few days, all of the 14 surviving fugitives in Tahiti had surrendered or been captured. Among \"Pandora's\" officers was former \"Bounty\" midshipman Thomas Hayward. Heywood's hopes that his former shipmate would verify his innocence were quickly dashed. Hayward, \"... like all worldlings raised a little in life, received us very coolly, and pretended ignorance of our affairs.\" \"Pandora\" remained at Tahiti for five weeks while Captain Edwards tried without success to obtain information on \"Bounty's\" whereabouts. A cell was built on \"Pandora's\" quarterdeck, a structure known as \"Pandora's Box\" where the prisoners, legs in irons and wrists in handcuffs, were to be confined for almost five months. Heywood wrote: \"The heat ... was so intense that the sweat frequently ran in streams to the scuppers, and produced maggots in a short time ... and the two necessary tubs which were constantly kept in place helped to render our situation truly disagreeable.\"\n\"Pandora\" left Tahiti on 8 May 1791 to search for Christian and the \"Bounty\" among the thousands of southern Pacific islands. Apart from a few spars—which had probably floated from Tubuai—discovered at Palmerston Island (Avarau), no traces of the ship could be found. Physical attacks from natives were frequent; early in August Edwards abandoned the search and headed for the Dutch East Indies via the Torres Strait. Knowledge of these waters and the surrounding reefs was minimal; on 29 August 1791, the ship ran aground on the outer Great Barrier Reef and began to fill with water. Three of the prisoners in \"Pandora's Box\" were let out and ordered to assist the crew at the pumps. In the subsequent struggle to save the ship the rest of the men in \"Pandora's Box\" were ignored as the regular crew went about their efforts to prevent the ship from foundering. At dawn it was clear that their efforts were in vain; the officers agreed that the vessel could not be saved and orders were then given to abandon ship. The armourer was ordered into the \"box\" to knock off the remaining prisoners' leg irons and shackles; however, the ship sank before he had finished. Heywood, stripped naked, was one of the last to get out of the cell; four prisoners, including Heywood's best friend George Stewart, were drowned, as were 31 of the regular crew. The 99 survivors, including ten prisoners, recovered on a nearby island where they stayed for two nights before embarking on an open-boat journey which largely followed Bligh's course of two years earlier. The prisoners were mostly kept bound hand and foot on the slow passage to Coupang, which they reached on 17 September 1791.\n\nThroughout this long ordeal Heywood somehow managed to hang on to his prayer book, and used it to jot down details of dates, places and events during his captivity. He recorded that at Coupang he and his fellow-prisoners were placed in the stocks and confined in the fortress before being sent to Batavia (now Jakarta) on the first leg of the voyage back to England. During a seven-week stay in Batavia confined aboard a Dutch East India Company ship, most of the prisoners, including Heywood, were allowed on deck only twice. On 25 December 1791 they were taken aboard a Dutch ship, \"Vreedenberg\", for passage to Europe via Cape Town. Still in the charge of Captain Edwards, the prisoners were kept in irons for most of the way. At the Cape they were eventually transferred to a British warship, , which set sail for England on 5 April 1792. On 19 June the ship arrived in Portsmouth where the prisoners were moved to the guardship .\n\nBligh had landed in England on 14 March 1790 to public acclaim, and was quickly promoted to post-captain. In the following months he wrote his account of the mutiny, and on 22 October was honourably acquitted at court martial of responsibility for the \"Bounty's\" loss. Early in 1791 he was appointed to command a new breadfruit expedition, which left London on 3 August of that year, before any news of the capture of Heywood and the others had reached London. Bligh would be gone for more than two years, and would thus be absent from the court martial proceedings that awaited the returned mutineers.\n\nFollowing Heywood's arrival in Portsmouth his family sought help from their wide circle of influential friends, and set out to secure the best available legal counsel. Most active on Heywood's behalf was his older sister Hester (\"Nessy\"), who gave her brother unqualified support, writing to him on 3 June: \"If the transactions of that day were as Mr. Bligh represented them, such is my conviction of your worth and honor that I will without hesitation stake my life on your innocence. If on the contrary you were concerned in such a conspiracy against your commander, I shall be firmly convinced that his conduct was the occasion of it.\" Heywood sent his personal narrative of the mutiny to the Earl of Chatham, who was First Lord of the Admiralty and brother to the prime minister, William Pitt. This was a step Heywood subsequently regretted; he had not consulted his lawyers, and his narrative contained statements that Heywood later rescinded on the grounds that they were \"the errors of an imperfect recollection\". On 8 June Nessy was advised by her and Heywood's uncle, Captain Thomas Pasley, that on the basis of information from the returned \"Pandora\" crew \"...your brother appears by all account to be the greatest culprit of all, Christian alone excepted ... I have no hope of his not being condemned.\" Later, however, Pasley was able to offer some comfort; Captain Montagu of \"Hector\", where Heywood was held, was Pasley's \"particular friend\". By chance another Heywood naval relative by marriage, Captain Albemarle Bertie, was in Portsmouth Harbour with his ship , moored alongside \"Hector\". Mrs Bertie, and \"Edgar's\" officers, were frequent visitors to Heywood, bringing gifts of food, clothing and other comforts.\n\nPasley secured the services of Aaron Graham, an experienced and clever advocate, to direct Heywood's legal strategy. Between June and September Heywood and his sister exchanged a stream of letters and ardent poems; Nessy's final letter, just before the court martial, exhorted: \"May the Almighty Providence, whose tender care has hitherto preserved you, be still your bountiful Protector! May he instil into the hearts of your judges every sentiment of justice, generosity and compassion ... and may you at length be restored to us.\"\n\nThe court martial opened on 12 September 1792 aboard in Portsmouth Harbour. Accused with Heywood were Joseph Coleman, Thomas McIntosh and Charles Norman, all of whom had been exonerated in Bligh's account and could confidently expect acquittal, as could Michael Byrne, the nearly blind ship's fiddler. The other accused were James Morrison, Thomas Burkitt, Thomas Ellison, John Millward and William Muspratt. The court martial board was presided over by Lord Hood, naval commander-in-chief at Portsmouth, and included Pasley's friend George Montagu and Heywood's relative by marriage, Albemarle Bertie.\n\nThe testimonies of the boatswain Cole, the carpenter Purcell, and the sailing master John Fryer were not unfavourable towards Heywood. However, Thomas Hayward's declared belief that Heywood was with the mutineers was damaging, as was the evidence of John Hallett concerning Heywood's alleged insolence in laughing and turning away from the captive Bligh—though Hallett had previously written to Nessy Heywood professing total ignorance of the part Heywood had played in the mutiny.\n\nHeywood opened his defence on 17 September 1792 with a long prepared statement read by one of his lawyers. It began with a frank acknowledgement of his predicament: to be even accused of mutiny was to \"appear at once the object of unpardonable guilt and exemplary vengeance\". His case rested on a series of arguments which, as historian Caroline Alexander points out, are not wholly consistent. First, Heywood pleaded his \"extreme youth and inexperience\" as the cause of his failure to join Bligh and the loyalists in the open boat, insisting that \"...I was influenced in my Conduct by the Example of my Messmates, Mr. Hallet and Mr. Hayward ... the latter, tho' he had been many years at Sea, yet, when Christian ordered him into the Boat he was ... so much overcome by the harsh Command, that he actually shed tears.\" Heywood then cited a different reason for staying aboard \"Bounty\": Bligh's launch was overloaded, and its destruction would be assured \"by the least addition to their Number\". Finally, Heywood maintained he had intended to join Bligh but had been stopped: \"...on hearing it suggested that I should be deem'd Guilty if I staid in the Ship, I went down directly, and in passing Mr. Cole told him in a low tone of voice that I would fetch a few necessaries in a Bag and follow him into the Boat, which at that time I meant to do but was afterwards prevented.\"\n\nUnder further questioning, Cole confirmed his belief that Heywood had been detained against his will. William Peckover, \"Bounty's\" gunnery officer, affirmed that if he had stayed aboard the ship in the hope of retaking her, he would have looked to Heywood for assistance. Witnesses from the \"Pandora\" attested that Heywood had surrendered himself voluntarily, and that he had been fully cooperative in providing information. On the issue of his alleged laughing at Bligh's predicament, Heywood managed to cast doubts on Hallett's testimony, asking how Hallett had managed \"to particularise the muscles of a man's countenance\" at some distance and during the hurly-burly of a mutiny. Heywood concluded his defence with what Alexander terms an \"audacious\" assertion that had Bligh been present in court he would have \"exculpated me from the least disrespect\".\n\nOn 18 September 1792, Lord Hood announced the court's verdicts. As expected, Coleman, McIntosh, Norman, and Byrne were acquitted. Heywood and the other five were found guilty of the charge of mutiny, and were ordered to suffer death by hanging. Lord Hood added: \"In consideration of various circumstances, the court did humbly and most earnestly recommend the said Peter Heywood and James Morrison to His Majesty's Royal Mercy.\" Heywood's family were quickly reassured by the lawyer Aaron Graham that the young man's life was safe and that he would soon be free.\n\nAs the weeks passed, Heywood calmly occupied himself by resuming his studies of the Tahitian language. Meanwhile the family—Nessy in particular—busied itself on his behalf, and another plea was made to the Earl of Chatham, in heart-rending terms. Shortly afterwards came the first indication that a royal pardon was in the offing, and on 26 October 1792, on \"Hector's\" quarterdeck, this was formally read to Heywood and Morrison by Captain Montagu. Heywood responded with a short statement that ended: \"I receive with gratitude my Sovereign's mercy, for which my future life will be faithfully devoted to his service.\" According to a Dutch newspaper which reported the case, his contrition was accompanied by a \"flood of tears\". William Muspratt, the only other of the accused to employ legal counsel, was reprieved on a legal technicality and pardoned in February 1793.\n\nThree days later, aboard , Millward, Burkitt and Ellison were hanged from the yardarms. Dening calls them \"a humble remnant on which to wreak vengeance\". There was some unease expressed in the press, a suspicion that \"money had bought the lives of some, and others fell sacrifice to their poverty.\" A report that Heywood was heir to a large fortune was unfounded; nevertheless, Dening asserts that \"in the end it was class or relations or patronage that made the difference.\" Some accounts claim that the condemned trio continued to protest their innocence until the last moment, while others speak of their \"manly firmness that ... was the admiration of all\".\n\nOn the specific recommendation of Lord Hood, who had offered the young man his personal patronage, Heywood resumed his naval career as a midshipman aboard his uncle Thomas Pasley's ship . In September 1793, he was summoned by Lord Howe, commander of the Channel Fleet, to serve on , the fleet's flagship. Hough observes that a pardon, followed by promotion, for one of Bligh's chief targets was \"a public rebuke to the absent captain, and everyone recognised it as such\". Although Bligh had departed on his second breadfruit expedition in August 1791 as a national hero, the court martial had revealed damaging evidence of his erratic and overbearing behaviour. The families of Heywood and Christian, noting the leniency that had acquitted four and pardoned three of the ten accused, began their own campaigns for vindication, and for revenge on Bligh. When Bligh returned in August 1793 he found that opinion had turned sharply against him. Lord Chatham, at the Admiralty, refused to receive his report or even see him—although Nathaniel Portlock, Bligh's lieutenant, was given a meeting. Bligh was then left unemployed, on half-pay, for 19 months before his next assignment.\n\nShortly after his release, Heywood had written to Edward Christian, Fletcher's older brother, that he would \"endeavour to prove that your brother was not that vile wretch, void of all gratitude ... but, on the contrary, a most worthy character ... beloved by all (except one, whose ill report is his greatest praise)\". This statement, published immediately after Heywood's pardon in a local Whitehaven newspaper as an open letter to Edward Christian, contradicted the respect Heywood had accorded Bligh in the courtroom, and, in turn, it led to the publication in late 1794 of Edward Christian's \"Appendix\" to the court martial proceedings. Presented as an account of the \"real causes and circumstances of that Unhappy Transaction\", the \"Appendix\" was said by the press to \"palliate the behaviour of Christian and the Mutineers, and to criminate Captain Bligh\". In the controversy that followed, Bligh's rebuttals could not silence doubts as to his own conduct, and his position was further undermined when William Peckover, a Bligh loyalist, confirmed that the allegations in the \"Appendix\" were substantially accurate.\n\nHeywood served on \"Queen Charlotte\" until March 1795, and was aboard her when the French fleet was defeated at Ushant on 1 June 1794, the occasion known as the \"Glorious First of June\". In August 1794 he was promoted acting lieutenant. In March 1795, doubts about his eligibility as a convicted mutineer for further promotion were set aside and his advancement to full lieutenant's rank was approved, despite his lacking the stated minimum of six years' service at sea. Among those who supported the promotion was Captain Hugh Cloberry Christian, a relative of Fletcher Christian.\n\nIn January 1796, Heywood was appointed third lieutenant to and sailed with her to the East Indies. He was to remain in this station for nine years. By the end of 1796 he was \"Fox's\" first lieutenant, and remained so until mid-1798 when he transferred to . On 17 May 1799, Heywood was given his first command, , a brig-of-war. In August 1800, Heywood was appointed commander of a bomb ship, the \"Vulcan\", in which he visited Coupang where he had been held prisoner eight years earlier. At this time he began the hydrographic work that would mark the remainder of his naval career.\n\nIn 1803, after a succession of commands, Heywood was promoted to post-captain. In command of , Heywood conducted a series of surveys of the eastern coasts of Ceylon and India, areas that had not been studied previously, and produced what Alexander describes as \"beautifully drafted charts\". In later years he was to produce similar charts for the north coast of Morocco, the River Plate area of South America, parts of the coasts of Sumatra and north-west Australia, and other channels and coastlines. His skill in this area may well have developed from Bligh's tutelage in the earlier stages of the \"Bounty\" voyage. Bligh, an accomplished draughtsman, had written of Christian and Heywood: \"These two had been objects of my particular regard and attention, and I had taken great pains to instruct them.\" James Horsburgh, who was hydrographer to the East India Company, wrote that Heywood's work had \"essentially contributed to making my Sailing Directory for the Indian navigation much more perfect than it would otherwise have been.\" The extent of Heywood's professional reputation was demonstrated when the position of Admiralty Hydrographer was offered to him in 1818, after he had retired from the sea. He declined, and the appointment went to Francis Beaufort on Heywood's recommendation.\n\nAfter a brief period ashore in 1805–06 Heywood was appointed flag captain to Rear-Admiral Sir George Murray, aboard . In March 1802 Murray's squadron was employed in the transportation of troops from the Cape of Good Hope to South America, in support of a failed British attempt to capture Buenos Aires from the Spanish, who were allied to the French during the Napoleonic wars. \"Polyphemus\" remained in the River Plate area, carrying out surveying and merchant vessel protection duties. 1808 saw Heywood back in England, in command of , which in the following year was part of a squadron that attacked and destroyed three French frigates in the Bay of Biscay, an action for which he received the Admiralty's thanks. After taking command of HMS \"Nereus\" in May 1809, Heywood served briefly in the Mediterranean under Admiral Lord Collingwood; after Collingwood's death in March 1810 Heywood brought his commander's body back to England. He then took \"Nereus\" to South America where he remained for three years, earning the gratitude of the British merchants in that region for his work in protecting trade routes. Heywood's last command was , in which he acted as escort to King Louis XVIII on the latter's return to France in May 1814. He remained with \"Montagu\" for the rest of his naval service.\n\nAlexander suggests that throughout his later career Heywood suffered a sense of guilt over his pardon, knowing that he had \"perjured himself\" in saying that he was kept below and therefore prevented from joining Bligh. She believes that Pasley and Graham may have bribed William Cole to testify that Heywood had been held against his will, echoing Thomas Bond, Bligh's nephew, who had asserted in 1792 that \"Heywood's friends have bribed through thick and thin to save him\". John Adams, the last survivor of Christian's \"Bounty\" party that sailed to Pitcairn Island, was discovered in 1808. In 1825, interviewed by Captain Edward Belcher, Adams maintained that Heywood was on the gangway, not below, and \"might have gone [in the open boat] if he pleased.\"\n\nOn 16 July 1816, \"Montagu\" was paid off in Chatham and Heywood finally retired from the sea. Two weeks later he married Frances Joliffe, a widow whom he had met ten years earlier, and settled with her at Highgate, near London. The couple had no children but, apart from his daughter in Tahiti, there is a suggestion in a will which he signed in 1810 that Heywood had also fathered a British child—the will makes provision for one Mary Gray, \"an infant under my care and protection\".\n\nIn May 1818, Heywood declined command of the Canadian Lakes with the rank of commodore. As he had become content with shore life, he said he would only accept another appointment in the event of war. In retirement Heywood published his dictionary of the Tahitian language, wrote papers relating to his profession, and corresponded widely. He enjoyed a circle of acquaintances which included the writer Charles Lamb, and was a particular friend of the hydrographer Francis Beaufort. He destroyed much of his writing shortly before his death, but a document from 1829 survives, in which he expresses his views on the unfitness for self-government of Greeks, Turks, Spaniards and Portuguese, the iniquities of the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, and the doubtful benefits of Catholic emancipation in Ireland. Of strong religious convictions, Heywood was increasingly interested in spiritual matters during the last years of his life. His health began to fail in 1828, and he died after suffering a stroke, aged 58, in February 1831. He was interred in the vault of Highgate School chapel, where a memorial plaque was dedicated on 8 December 2008.\n\nNessy Heywood had died on 25 August 1793, less than a year after Heywood's pardon. Heywood's adversaries John Hallett and Thomas Hayward both died at sea within three years of the court martial. William Muspratt died in Royal Navy service in 1797 as did James Morrison in 1807. William Bligh served in the battles of Camperdown and Copenhagen before, in 1806, he was appointed Governor of New South Wales. He returned to London in 1810 having suffered a further rebellion by local army officers who opposed Bligh's attempts to reform local practices, as well as his rule by \"fiat\"; Bligh was again court-martialed and acquitted. On his retirement he was promoted to rear admiral; he died in 1817. Fletcher Christian, who had taken the \"Bounty\" to Pitcairn Island and founded a colony there with a group of hard core mutineers and conscripted Tahitians, was killed in September 1793 during a feud. Christian's last recorded words, supposedly, were \"Oh, dear!\"\n\n\n"}

She is known for her films, \"Joy of Madness\" (2003)\",\" \"Buddha Collapsed Out of Shame\" (2007) and \"Green Days\" (2009). Makhmalbaf won the Lina Mangiacapre Award at the Venice Film Festival in 2003 for \"Joy of Madness\" (2003)\". Joy of Madness\" also won the Special Jury Prize at Tokyo Filmex. Makhmalbaf's film \"Buddha Collapsed Out of Shame\" won various awards as well, such as the Paolo Ungari UNICEF Prize from the Rome Film Festival and the Peace Film Award at the Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nMakhmalbaf's film involvement began early in her life. By age three, she had already attended the Cannes Film Festival. Her own work gained attention by age eight when the Locarno Film Festival screened her first short film titled \"The Day My Aunt Was Ill.\"\n\nMakhmalbaf expressed interest in being a painter, but did not like the \"loneliness\" that she described in the art form. She then was drawn to filmmaking, and she found the on-set experience compelling. In an interview, Makhmalbaf explained that hearing the words \"lights, camera, action\" was exciting and had a \"strange power\".\n\nAt the age of eight, Makhmalbaf decided she did not want to continue attending school. She then switched to her father's film academy and studio, Makhmalbaf Film House, in her hometown of Tehran. In the Makhmalbaf Film House, the students learned about many art forms such as painting, photography and cinema. Makhmalbaf had to keep up with what her peers were learning in addition to studying at the film academy. Makhmalbaf began to miss her previous schooling and went back for a few weeks. However, she quickly realized she would rather be the Makhmabaf Film House after experiencing the formal education system again.\n\nMakhmalbaf's debut documentary was released in 2003 and was entitled \"Joy of Madness\". The film was about the making of her sister Samira's film \"At Five in the Afternoon\". Makhmalbaf was able to take advantage of being only 13 to amass much candid digital footage when Samira was trying to persuade Afghan people to take part in her film. She was described as being able to blend in and remain overlooked as she shot her film among the production. She was able to capture so much on film because her age caused people to not to hide from her since they did not take her seriously.\n\nWhen \"Joy of Madness\"(2003) premiered at the Venice Film Festival, Makhmalbaf was too young to attend her own screening under Italian law. \"Joy of Madness\" was also screened at the Cannes Film Festival, where Makhmalbaf beat the record of the youngest person to have a film screened in the festival.

Mosleh Shirazi (1236–1311) () was a 13th-century Iranian polymath and poet who made contributions to astronomy, mathematics, medicine, physics, music theory, philosophy and Sufism.\n\nHe was born in Kazerun in October 1236 to a family with a tradition of Sufism. His father, Zia' al-Din Mas'ud Kazeruni was a physician by profession and also a leading Sufi of the Kazeruni order. Zia' Al-Din received his Kherqa (Sufi robe) from Shahab al-Din Omar Suhrawardi. Qutb al-Din was garbed by the Kherqa (Sufi robe) as blessing by his father at age of ten. Later on, he also received his own robe from the hands of Najib al-Din Bozgush Shirazni, a famous Sufi of the time. Quṭb al-Din began studying medicine under his father. His father practiced and taught medicine at the Mozaffari hospital in Shiraz. After the passing away of his father (when Qutb al-Din was 14), his uncle and other masters of the period trained him in medicine. He also studied the Qanun (the Canon) of the famous Persian scholar Avicenna and its commentaries. In particular he read the commentary of Fakhr al-Din Razi on the Canon of Medicine and Qutb al-Din raised many issues of his own. This led to his own decision to write his own commentary, where he resolved many of the issues in the company of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi.\n\nQutb al-Din lost his father at the age of fourteen and replaced him as the ophthalmologist at the Mozaffari hospital in Shiraz. At the same time, he pursued his education under his uncle Kamal al-Din Abu'l Khayr and then Sharaf al-Din Zaki Bushkani, and Shams al-Din Mohammad Kishi. All three were expert teachers of the Canon of Avicenna. He quit his medical profession ten years later and began to devote his time to further education under the guidance of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. When Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, the renowned scholar-vizier of the Mongol Holagu Khan established the observatory of Maragha, Qutb al-Din Shirazi became attracted to the city. He left Shiraz sometime after 1260 and was in Maragha about 1262. In Maragha, Qutb al-din resumed his education under Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, with whom he studied the al-Esharat wa'l-Tanbihat of Avicenna. He discussed with al-Tusi the difficulties he had understanding the first book of the Canon of Avicenna. While working in the new observatory, he studied astronomy under al-Tusi. One of the important scientific projects was the completion of the new astronomical table (zij). In his testament (Wasiya), al-Tusi advises his son ṣil-a-Din to work with Qutb al-Din in the completion of the Zij.\n\nQutb-al-Din's stay in Maragha was short. Subsequently, he traveled to Khorasan in the company of al-Tusi where he stayed to study under Najm al-Din Katebi Qazvini in the town of Jovayn and become his assistant. Some time after 1268, he journeyed to Qazvin, Isfahan, Baghdad and later Konya in Anatolia. This was a time when the Persian poet Jalal al-Din Muhammad Balkhi (Rumi) was gaining fame there and it is reported that Qutb al-Din also met him. In Konya, he studied the Jam'e al-Osul of Ibn Al-Athir with Sadr al-Din Qunawi. The governor of Konya, Mo'in al-Din Parvana appointed him as the judge of Sivas and Malatya. It was during this time that he compiled the books the \"Meftāḥ al-meftāh\", \"Ekhtiārāt al-moẓaffariya\", and his commentary on Sakkāki. In the year 1282, he was envoy on behalf of the Ilkhanid Ahmad Takudar to Sayf al-Din Qalawun, the Mamluk ruler of Egypt. In his letter to Qalawun, the Ilkhanid ruler mentions Qutb al-Din as the chief judge. Qutb al-Din during this time collected various critiques and commentaries on Avicenna's Canon and used them on his commentary on the Kolliyāt. The last part of Qutb al-Din's active career was teaching the Canon of Avicenna and the Shefa of Avicenna in Syria. He soon left for Tabriz after that and died shortly after. He was buried in the Čarandāb cemetery of the city.\n\nShirazi identified observations by the scholar Avicenna in the 11th century and Ibn Bajjah in the 12th century as transits of Venus and Mercury. However, Ibn Bajjah cannot have observed a transit of Venus, as none occurred in his lifetime.\n\nQutb al-Din had an insatiable desire for learning, which is evidenced by the twenty-four years he spent studying with masters of the time in order to write his commentary on the Kolliyāt. He was also distinguished by his extensive breadth of knowledge, a clever sense of humor and indiscriminate generosity. He was also a master chess player and played the musical instrument known as the Rabab, a favorite instrument of the Persian poet Rumi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQutb al-Din was also a Sufi from a family of Sufis in Shiraz. He is famous for the commentary on Hikmat al-ishraq of Suhrawardi, the most influential work of Islamic Illuminist philosophy.\n\n\n"}

The current commission was created by the 1987 Constitution.\n\nWhile often associated with the Congress of the Philippines, which consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and mistakenly referred to as a congressional committee, the Commission on Appointments is an independent body from the legislature, though its membership is confined to members of Congress.\n\nThe Commission on Appointments confirms certain appointments made by the President of the Philippines. Article VII, Section 16 of the 1987 Constitution reads:\n\"The President shall nominate and, with the consent of the Commission on Appointments, appoint the heads of the executive departments, ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, or officers of the armed forces from the rank of colonel or naval captain, and other officers whose appointments are vested in him in this Constitution. He shall also appoint all other officers of the Government whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by law, and those whom he may be authorized by law to appoint. The Congress may, by law, vest the appointment of other officers lower in rank in the President alone, in the courts, or in the heads of departments, agencies, commissions, or boards.\n\nThe only government official that is exempted is the Vice President should he or she be appointed to any cabinet position. The nomination of a person to the vice presidency due to a vacancy is handled by both houses of Congress, voting separately.\n\nDuring the operation of the 1935 Constitution, replaced in 1971, the commission was composed of 12 senators and 12 representatives. During the operation of the 1973 Constitution, the president appointed at will and without \"checks and balances\" from the then-parliament. The current constitution, which was ratified in 1987, brought back the 25-member commission.\n\n\nThe appointments of all judges and the Ombudsman need not be confirmed by the Commission on Appointments. Instead, they are recommended by the Judicial and Bar Council in a short list, from which the President shall then choose from.\n\nPrior to the institutionalization of the party-list system, the president appointed the sectoral representatives. Congress then decided to have these confirmed via the commission, as well.\n\nThe Commission is composed of the Senate President, the \"ex officio\" chairman, twelve senators, and twelve members of the House of Representatives. Members from each house of Congress are elected based on proportional representation from the political parties and parties or organizations registered under the party-list system represented. The Chairman of the Commission shall vote only in case of a tie. It shall act on all appointments submitted within thirty session days of Congress. It shall be governed by a majority vote of all members.\n\nA president can either make a nomination or an appointment. Either action involves the commission.\n\nMost presidential actions are \"ad interim\" appointments, done when Congress is not in session. In these cases, the appointment allows the official to discharge the duties related to the office immediately. The \"ad interim\" appointment ceases to be valid if the commission explicitly rejects the appointment, or if the commission \"bypasses\" the appointment. If the commission rejects the appointment, the official is no longer allowed to discharge the duties related to his or her office, and the president has to appoint someone else. If the commission bypasses the official, the president can re-appoint that person.\n\nThe president can also \"nominate\" an official if Congress is in session. In a \"regular\" nomination, the official can only discharge the duties once the commission consents to the appointment.\n\nJust as other legislative bodies, the commission is divided into different committees. Each appointment is coursed through the committee concerned. After hearings are held, the committee decides to confirm or reject the appointment; the commission \"en banc\" then deliberates on whether to accept the committee's decision.\n\nThe commission meets at the GSIS Complex in Pasay, the seat of the Senate.\n\nMembers for the 18th Congress as of August 6, 2019:\n\nNotes\nRejection by the commission of the president's appointment is very rare. Usually, due to the padrino system of patronage politics, the president's party controls a supermajority of votes in the House of Representatives, thus mirroring its composition of the commission. This means appointments are almost always are approved, although some are not without difficulty.\n\nDuring the ongoing presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, five of his appointments were rejected. These are:\n\nOther administrations also had a few of its appointments rejected. These were:\n\n"}

Heywood also disliked Hayward, calling him a 'worldling', raised a little in society, as a result of which he typically affected airs and graces beyond his station.\n\nUpon returning to England with Bligh, Hayward set out as third lieutenant under Captain Edward Edwards on . Although they succeeded in finding some of the mutineers on Tahiti, and Hayward evidently performed well, it was an unfortunate voyage, ending with \"Pandora\" shipwrecked, and for the second time in as many years Hayward found himself without a ship, in an open boat making for safety. He eventually returned to England with other survivors from the \"Pandora\", after which his career is uncertain. It has been suggested, based mainly on nearly illegible papers, that Hayward commanded the sloop HMS \"Swift\". If so, he drowned when the ship was lost with all hands in a typhoon in the South China Sea in 1797 or 1798.\n\nHayward is frequently confused with Peter Heywood – a fellow \"Bounty\" midshipman – because of their similar-sounding names; for instance, in the 1984 film \"The Bounty\", Hayward was characterized as one of the mutineers who decided to stay at Tahiti.\n\n"}

Jaldapara is situated at an altitude of 61 m and is spread across of vast grassland with patches of riverine forests. It was declared a sanctuary in 1941 for protection of its great variety flora and fauna. Today, it has the largest population of the Indian one horned rhinoceros in the state, an animal threatened with extinction, and is a Habitat management area (Category IV). The nearby Chilapata Forests is an elephant corridor between Jaldapara and the Buxa Tiger Reserve Near by is the Gorumara National Park, known for its population of Indian rhinoceros.\n\nToto tribes and Mech Tribes (Bodos) used to stay in this area before 1800. At that time this place was known as \"Totopara\". Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary was established in 1941 for the purpose of protecting the Indian one-horned rhinoceros. In May 2012 it was declared a national park.\n\nThe forest is mainly savannah covered with tall elephant grasses. The main attraction of the park is the Indian one-horned rhinoceros. The park holds the largest rhino population in India after Kaziranga National Park in Assam. Other animals in the park include Indian leopard, Indian elephants, sambar, barking deer, spotted deer, hog deer, wild boars, and gaur.\n\nJaldapara is a paradise for bird watchers. It is one of the very few places in India, where the Bengal florican is sighted. The other birds to be found here are the crested eagle, Pallas's fish eagle, shikra, Finn's weaver, jungle fowl, peafowl (peacock), partridge, and lesser pied hornbill. Pythons, monitor lizards, kraits, cobras, geckos, and about eight species of fresh water turtles can also be found here.\n\nMany of the animals in the park are endangered, like the Indian one-horned rhino and elephants.\n\n"}
{"id": "2014792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2014792", "title": "Bullingdon Club", "text": "Bullingdon Club\n\nThe Bullingdon Club is a private all-male dining club for Oxford University students. It is known for its wealthy members, grand banquets, boisterous rituals, and occasionally bad behaviour, including vandalism of restaurants and students' rooms. The club is known to select its members not only on the grounds of wealth and willingness to partake but also by means of education; with undergraduates from colleges such as Christ Church and Magdalen who formerly were pupils at various public schools; Eton, Harrow, Shrewsbury, Rugby, Westminster, Charterhouse, and Winchester, among other private boarding schools like Radley, form most of its membership.\n\nThe Bullingdon was originally a sporting club, dedicated to cricket and horse-racing, although club dinners gradually became its principal activity. Membership is expensive, with tailor-made uniforms, regular gourmet hospitality, and a tradition of on-the-spot payment for damage. The club has attracted controversy, as some members have gone on to become leading figures within Britain's political establishment. These include the former Prime Minister David Cameron, former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and current Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nThe Bullingdon is regularly featured in fiction and drama, sometimes under its own name, and sometimes easily recognisable under another (as in the 2014 film\" The Riot Club\").\n\nThe Bullingdon Club was founded more than 200 years ago. Petre Mais claims it was founded in 1780 and was limited to 30 men, and Viscount Long, who was a member in 1875, described it as \"an old Oxford institution, with many good traditions\". Originally it was a hunting and cricket club, and Thomas Assheton Smith the Younger is recorded as having batted for the Bullingdon against Marylebone Cricket Club in 1796. In 1805 cricket at Oxford University \"was confined to the old Bullingdon Club, which was expensive and exclusive\". This foundational sporting purpose is attested to in the Club's symbol.\n\n\"The Wisden Cricketer\" reports that the Bullingdon is \"ostensibly one of the two original Oxford University cricket teams but it actually used cricket merely as a respectable front for the mischievous, destructive or self-indulgent tendencies of its members\". By the late 19th century, the present emphasis on dining within the Club began to emerge. Long attested that in 1875 \"Bullingdon Club [cricket] matches were also of frequent occurrence, and many a good game was played there with visiting clubs. The Bullingdon Club dinners were the occasion of a great display of exuberant spirits, accompanied by a considerable consumption of the good things of life, which often made the drive back to Oxford an experience of exceptional nature\". A report of 1876 relates that \"cricket there was secondary to the dinners, and the men were chiefly of an expensive class\". \"The New York Times\" told its readers in 1913 that \"The Bullingdon represents the acme of exclusiveness at Oxford; it is the club of the sons of nobility, the sons of great wealth; its membership represents the 'young bloods' of the university\".\n\nToday, the Bullingdon is primarily a dining club, although a vestige of the Club's sporting links survives in its support of an annual point to point race. The Club President, known as the \"General\", presents the winner's cup, and the Club members meet at the race for a champagne breakfast. The Club also meets for an annual Club dinner. Guests may be invited to either of these events. There may also be smaller dinners during the year to mark the initiation of new members or in celebration of other occasions. The club often books private dining rooms under an assumed name, as most restaurateurs are cautious of the Club's reputation as being the cause of considerable drunken damage during the course of their dinners.\n\nIn 2007, a photograph of the Bullingdon Club taken in 1987 was discovered – making British headlines because two of the posing members, Boris Johnson and David Cameron, both of whom had gone on to careers in politics and were, at the time, Mayor of London and Leader of the Conservative party respectively. The copyright owners have since declined to grant permission to use the picture.\n\nIn recent years, following negative media attention and the Club's apparent depiction in the play \"Posh\" and its film adaptation \"The Riot Club\", membership has been supposed to have dwindled: in 2016 it was claimed there were only between four and six members left, all of them postgraduates, with no new undergraduate members joining the previous year; although many consider it more likely that the club has simply resorted to more covert operation in recent times. Many Oxford students cited an unwillingness to be associated with \"ostentatious wealth celebration\". In June 2017, members of the Club attempting to shoot their annual Club Photo on the steps of Christ Church were escorted out by college porters for not securing permission for the shoot. Nearby non-member students heckled the club as they left, with one even playing \"Yakety Sax\" (the theme song for \"The Benny Hill Show\").\n\nThe club has always been noted for its wealthy members, grand banquets, and boisterous rituals, including the vandalisation of restaurants, public houses, and college rooms, complemented by a tradition of on-the-spot payment for damage. Its ostentatious displays of wealth attract controversy, since some ex-members have subsequently achieved high political stations, most notably the former British Prime Minister David Cameron, former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and the current Prime Minister Boris Johnson. A number of episodes over many decades have provided anecdotal evidence of the Club's behaviour. Infamously on 12 May 1894, after dinner, Bullingdon members smashed almost all the glass of the lights and 468 windows in Peckwater Quad of Christ Church, along with the blinds and doors of the building, and again on 20 February 1927. As a result of such events, the Club was banned from convening within 15 miles of Oxford.\n\nWhile still Prince of Wales, Edward VIII had a certain amount of difficulty in getting his parents' permission to join the Bullingdon on account of the Club's reputation. He eventually obtained it only on the understanding that he never join in what was then known as a \"Bullingdon blind\", a euphemistic phrase for an evening of drink and song. On hearing of his eventual attendance at one such evening, Queen Mary sent him a telegram requesting that he remove his name from the Club.\n\nAndrew Gimson, biographer of Boris Johnson, reported about the club in the 1980s: \"I don't think an evening would have ended without a restaurant being trashed and being paid for in full, very often in cash. [...] A night in the cells would be regarded as being par for a Buller man and so would debagging anyone who really attracted the irritation of the Buller men.\"\n\nIn December 2005, Bullingdon Club members smashed 17 bottles of wine, \"every piece of crockery,\" and a window at the 15th century White Hart pub in Fyfield near Oxford. The dinner was organised by The Honourable Alexander Fellowes, son of Baron Fellowes and nephew to Diana, Princess of Wales; four members of the party were arrested. A further dinner was reported in 2010 after damage to a country house.\n\nIn the last few years, the Bullingdon has been mentioned in the debates of the House of Commons in order to draw attention to excessive behaviour across the British class spectrum, and to embarrass prominent Conservative Party politicians who are former members of the Bullingdon. Johnson has since tried to distance himself from the club, calling it \"a truly shameful vignette of almost superhuman undergraduate arrogance, toffishness and twittishness.\"\n\nThe Club's colours are sky blue and ivory. Members dress for their annual Club dinner in bespoke tailored tailcoats in dark navy blue, with a matching velvet collar, offset with ivory silk lapel revers, brass monogrammed buttons, a mustard waistcoat, and a sky blue bow tie. There is also a Club tie, which is sky blue striped with ivory. These are all provided by the Oxford branch of court tailors Ede and Ravenscroft. In 2007 the full uniform was estimated to cost £3,500. Traditionally when they played cricket, members \"were identified by a ribbon of blue and white on their straw hats, and by stripes of the same colours down their flannel trousers\".\n\nThe Bullingdon is not currently registered with the University of Oxford, but members are drawn from among the members of the University. On several occasions in the past, when the club was registered, the University proctors suspended it on account of the rowdiness of members' activities, including suspensions in 1927 and 1956. John Betjeman wrote in 1938 that \"quite often the Club is suspended for some years after each meeting\". While under suspension, the club has been known to meet in relative secrecy.\n\nThe club was known to be active in Oxford in 2008/9, although not registered with the University. In his retirement speech as proctor, Professor of Geology Donald Fraser noted an incident which, not being on University premises, was outside their jurisdiction: \"some students had taken habitually to the drunken braying of ‘We are the Bullingdon’ at 3 a.m. from a house not far from the Phoenix Cinema. But the transcript of what they called the wife of the neighbour who went to ask them to be quiet was written in language that is not usually printed\".\n\nIn October 2018, the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) announced that members of the Bullingdon Club would be banned from holding office within the Association. OUCA president, Ben Etty, outspokenly stated that the Club's \"values and activities had no place in the modern Conservative Party'\". This decision was overturned several weeks later \"on a constitutional technicality\", although Etty was confident that \"that ban will be re-proposed very soon\". The ban was later re-implemented on appeal to OUCA's Senior Member and remains in effect.\n\nA number of the Club's annual photographs have emerged over the years, with each giving insight into its past members.\n\nA photograph taken in 1987 depicting David Cameron and Boris Johnson among other members of the club, including Jonathan Ford of the \"Financial Times\", is the best-known example. In an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr, David Cameron said that the photograph was an embarrassment. BBC Two's \"Newsnight\" commissioned a painting to recreate the photograph because the photographers who own the copyright objected to its being published on commercial grounds.\n\nA photograph taken in 1988, also depicting the future British Prime Minister David Cameron, this time as Club President and standing in the centre of the group, later emerged. It was found by the student newspaper, \"VERSA\", amongst over a dozen other photographs of the club dated between 1950 and 2010 hanging on the wall of the tailor that is believed to have made the members’ suits, and led to a number of other past members being identified. Gillman and Soame, the photographers who own the copyright to the image, withdrew permission for it to be reproduced. \"VERSA\", which discovered the photographs, commissioned sketches to reproduce the scenes depicted in them.\n\nA photograph of the club taken in 1992 depicted George Osborne, Nathaniel Philip Rothschild, David Cameron's cousin Harry Mount and \"Ocado\" founder Jason Gissing. In the \"Mail on Sunday\", Peter Hitchens claimed that the photograph had been doctored, and that it appeared that people had been removed from it.\n\nIn 2013, a new photograph emerged of club members flying by private jet to a hunting expedition in South Africa. The photograph is believed to have been taken the previous year. Pictured in the photograph are Hon. Michael Marks, Cassius Nicholas Green, Timothy Aldersly, Charles Clegg, Alick Dru and Hon. George Farmer – the son of the former treasurer of the Conservative Party, Michael Farmer, Baron Farmer.\n\nDavid Cameron's and Boris Johnson's period in the Bullingdon Club was examined in the UK Channel 4 docu-drama \"When Boris Met Dave\", broadcast on 7 October 2009 on More 4. An \"Observer Magazine\" article in October 2011 reviewed George Osborne's membership of the club.\n\nThe Bullingdon is satirised as 'the Bollinger Club' (Bollinger being a notable brand of champagne) in Evelyn Waugh's novel \"Decline and Fall\" (1928), where it has a pivotal role in the plot: the mild-mannered hero is blamed for the Bollinger Club's destructive rampage through his college and is sent down. Tom Driberg claimed that the description of the Bollinger Club was a \"mild account of the night of any Bullingdon Club dinner in Christ Church. Such a profusion of glass I never saw until the height of the Blitz. On such nights, any undergraduate who was believed to have 'artistic' talents was an automatic target.\"\n\nWaugh mentions the Bullingdon by name in \"Brideshead Revisited\". In talking to Charles Ryder, Anthony Blanche relates that the Bullingdon attempted to \"put him in Mercury\" in Tom Quad one evening, Mercury being a large fountain in the centre of the Quad. Blanche describes the members in their tails as looking \"like a lot of most disorderly footmen\", and goes on to say: \"Do you know, I went round to call on Sebastian next day? I thought the tale of my evening's adventures might amuse him.\" This could indicate that Sebastian was not a member of the Bullingdon, although in the 1981 TV adaptation, Lord Sebastian Flyte vomits through the window of Charles Ryder's college room while wearing the famous Bullingdon tails. The 2008 film adaptation of \"Brideshead Revisited\" likewise clothes Flyte in the Club tails during this scene, as his fellow revellers chant \"Buller, Buller, Buller!\" behind him.\n\nA fictional Oxford dining society inspired by clubs like the Bullingdon forms the basis of the play \"Posh\" by Laura Wade, staged in April 2010 at the Royal Court Theatre, London. Membership of the club while still a student is exaggeratedly depicted in the play as giving a student admission to a secret and corrupt network of influence within the Tory Party later in life. The play was later adapted into the 2014 film \"The Riot Club\".\n\nThe TV series \"Trinity\", set in a \"Trinity College\" in a fictional English city, featured an elite \"Dandelion Club\" whose members wore yellow waistcoats like those of the Bullingdon Club and behaved in a similar manner.\n\nPast members of the club include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Each confederation — the AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), CONCACAF (North, Central America and Caribbean), CONMEBOL (South America), OFC (Oceania), and UEFA (Europe) — was allocated a certain number of the 32 places at the tournament. A total of 197 teams entered the qualification process for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In 2001 FIFA ended automatic qualification of the reigning champion, so that 2002 champions Brazil became first to participate in the qualifying tournament. The hosts (Germany) retained their automatic spot. \n\nThe original distribution of places between the six confederations called for Oceania to be given one full spot in the final 32; this idea was seen as virtually guaranteeing a place in the finals to Australia, by far the strongest footballing nation in the region. This decision was reconsidered in June 2003 and the previous distribution of places between Oceania and South America was restored.\n\nThe draw for five of the six qualification tournaments took place on 5 December 2003 in Frankfurt, whilst all of the members of the South American federation (CONMEBOL) competed in a single group. Qualification itself began in January 2004.\n\nThe following 32 teams qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup:\nIncludes 10 appearances by \"DFB\" representing West Germany between 1954 and 1990. Excludes 1 appearance by \"DVF\" representing East Germany between 1954 and 1990.\n\nParticipated as a part of Soviet Union between 1930 and 1990.\n\nIncludes appearances by pre-division Yugoslavia, as FIFA considers Serbia and Montenegro as a successor of a team.\n\nIncludes appearances by Czechoslovakia, as FIFA considers Czech Republic as a successor of a team.\n\"13 of the 32 teams subsequently failed to qualify for the 2010 finals: Angola, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Iran, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia and Ukraine.\"\n\nA total of 197 teams entered the qualification process for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, competing for a total of 32 spots in the final tournament. Germany, as the host, qualified automatically, leaving 31 spots open for competition. \n\nStarting with these qualifiers, the defending champion (Brazil) was not granted automatic qualification for the first time. FIFA announced the decision in December 2001 at the draw for the 2002 Finals Tournament. The official reason was that the friendly matches to which previous champions were restricted provided inferior preparation to the competitive qualification matches others would have played. Media also noted that the change released an extra place for the contentious distribution of places by confederation.\n\nThe final distribution was as follows:\n\nThe distribution by confederation for the 2006 FIFA World Cup was:\n\nUEFA and CAF have a guaranteed number of places, whereas the number of qualifiers from other confederations is dependent on play-offs between AFC's fifth-placed team and CONMEBOL's fifth-placed team, and between CONCACAF's fourth-placed team and OFC's first-placed team. A draw determined the pairings between the four teams involved.\n\nAfter the 2006 FIFA World Cup group stage of 2006 FIFA World Cup finals, the percentage of teams from each confederation that passed through to the round of 16 was as follows:\n\nFor FIFA World Cup qualifying stages using a league format, the method used for separating teams level on points is the same for all Confederations. The rules for separating teams level on points are decided by FIFA and can be found in article 18 part 6d to 6g of the FIFA Regulations 2006 World Cup Germany\n\nIf teams are even on points at the end of group play, the tied teams will be ranked by:\n\nFor FIFA World Cup qualifying stages using a home-and-away knockout format, the team that has the higher aggregate score over the two legs progresses to the next round. In the event that aggregate scores finish level, the away goals rule is applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progresses. If away goals are also equal, then thirty minutes of extra time are played, divided into two fifteen-minutes halves. The away goals rule is again applied after extra time, i.e. if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team qualifies by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals are scored during extra time, the tie is decided by penalty shoot-out.\n\nThis is a change from the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where total goal difference was the first tiebreaker.\n\nA total of 194 teams played at least one qualifying match. A total of 847 qualifying matches were played, and 2464 goals were scored (an average of 2.91 per match).\n\n44 Asian teams are affiliated with FIFA, but Cambodia, Philippines, Bhutan and Brunei decided not to take part, and Myanmar was banned from the competition, so a total of 39 teams took part, competing for 4.5 places in the World Cup.\n\nThe qualification was composed of three rounds. \n\n\"'Bahrain\" advanced to the AFC–CONCACAF play-off on the away goals rule.\n\nThe qualification was composed of two Rounds. 9 teams entered the competition directly on the Second Round: the 5 teams that qualified for the 2002 World Cup Finals (Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia) and the 4 highest-ranking teams in the June 25, 2003 FIFA world rankings (Congo DR, Ivory Coast, Egypt, and Morocco). The other 42 teams were paired 2-by-2 and played knock-out matches home-and-away. The 21 winners would advance to the Second Round.\n\nIn the Second Round, the 30 teams were divided in 5 groups of 6 teams each. Teams in each group would play against each other in a home-and-away basis. The team with most points in each group would qualify to the World Cup.\n\nThe competition also constituted the qualification competition for the 2006 African Nations Cup with the top three nations of each group qualifying (except for Egypt, which qualifies as the host nation, the fourth nation in Egypt's group qualifying in Egypt's place).\n\nThe African qualifying zone saw 4 out of 5 finals places going to World Cup debutants (Angola, Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana). Nigeria missed out on a fourth consecutive finals appearance while Cameroon did not reach their fifth consecutive finals.\n\nThe African zone also featured a group of death — Group 3, which brought together Africa's most frequent World Cup qualifier Cameroon with the two eventual finalists of the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations: Egypt and the Ivory Coast.\n\nThe qualification process was divided in three stages. In the first stage, the 34 teams were divided in 10 groups of three teams each and two groups of two teams each. Groups with three teams had two rounds, with the best ranked team according to FIFA in each group entering the competition in the second round. In each group, teams were paired 2-by-2 and played home-and-away matches.\n\nThe 12 winners of the first stage advanced to the second stage, where they were divided into three groups of four teams each. Teams in each group would play against each other home-and-away, and the two teams with most points in each group would advance to the Final Round.\n\nIn the third stage, the six teams were put in a single group, and played against each other home-and-away. The three teams with most points qualified to the World Cup. The fourth placed team advanced to the AFC–CONCACAF play-off against the winner of a play-off between third placed teams in the Third Round of Asia.\n\n10 teams took part, all in a single group. The rules were very simple: the teams would play against each other in a home-and-away basis, with the four teams with most points qualifying to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The fifth ranked team would have to play-off against the best team from Oceania, with the winner of this play-off also qualifying. For the first time, Brazil, the defending champion, was required to go through qualification and was not automatically qualified for the tournament.\n\n12 teams took part, competing for a place in the intercontinental play-off against the fifth-placed team from South America. The winner of this play-off qualified for the World Cup.\n\nIn the Second round, the six teams were put in a single group, and played against each other once. The two teams with most points advanced to a play-off, and played against each other home and away. The winner of this play-off advanced to the intercontinental play-off.\nAustralia and the Solomon Islands progressed to the final stage.\n\nA total of 51 teams took part, divided in 8 groups (five groups of six teams each and three groups of seven teams each) competing for 13 places in the World Cup. Germany, the hosts, were already qualified, for a total of 14 European places in the tournament. The qualifying process started on 18 August 2004, over a month after the end of UEFA Euro 2004, and ended on 16 November 2005.\n\nThe teams in each group would play against each other in a home and away basis. The team with most points in each group would qualify to the World Cup. The runners up would be ranked. For the sake of fairness, in groups with seven teams, results against the seventh placed team were ignored. The two best ranked runners up would also qualify to the World Cup. The other six runners up were drawn into three home and away knock out matches, winners of those matches also qualifying.\nSweden and Poland qualified directly to the World Cup. The other teams had to play off.\n\nA draw was held on 14 October 2005 at FIFA headquarters in Zürich to pair each team from Pot 1 with a team from Pot 2. A second draw at the same time and location determined the order of the fixtures.\n\nThere were two scheduled inter-confederation playoffs to determine the final two qualification spots to the finals. The first legs were played on 12 November 2005, and the second legs were played on 16 November 2005.\n\n\n\n\nIncluded goals in the Inter-confederation play-offs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in 1742 and christened in St Remegius' Church, Water Newton. He never married.\n\nOn 7 September 1759, age 17, he was commissioned as a lieutenant. To qualify for this commission he would have been required, in addition to passing a lieutenant’s exam, to produce evidence of at least six years of sea time. No documents have been located to date which would establish exactly when, and under whose patronage, he started his naval career. It is likely he first went to sea as a captain's servant when about 10 years old and subsequently completed at least part of the required sea time as a midshipman. A signature, 'Edwd Edwards’, inscribed on a document witnessing the Will of one Isaac Bishopbridge serving \"on Board His Majestys Ship of Warr the \"Devonshire\",\" suggests that Edwards may have sailed under Captain John Moore on HMS \"Devonshire\" in April 1756.\n\nHis naval career after he was commissioned included service in the following ships, before being appointed to \"Pandora\":\n\n\nHe spent the following six years on half-pay after the end of the American Revolutionary war; until 6 August 1790, when he was appointed to take command of the frigate \"Pandora\". He received new orders on 11 August to prepare his new command for a journey to \"remote parts\", on a mission in pursuit of the \"Bounty\" mutineers.\n\nWith the help of former \"Bounty\" midshipman Thomas Hayward - a Bligh loyalist recently returned to England from the South Pacific - Edwards succeeded in finding fourteen men (Bligh had stated that four of these were loyal but could not be accommodated on the over-full launch with the other loyal men; so Edwards found ten mutineers), but the \"Pandora\" foundered on the Great Barrier Reef on 29 August 1791 during the journey home from the South Pacific. Four of the ten mutineers and 31 of \"Pandora\"s crew died in the destruction of the ship. After an arduous open boat voyage from the wreck to Timor and on to Batavia (Jakarta), only 78 men of \"Pandora\"s original 134-strong crew eventually reached England, accompanied by six mutineers and four loyalists. For Hayward this was the second time in as many years that had he found himself in an open boat making for a safe haven in the Dutch East Indies.\n\nEdwards was court-martialed on 17 September 1792 for the loss of the \"Pandora\". Immediately prior to the proceedings, he submitted to the Admiralty his account of the events leading up to the sinking. All of his officers supported Edwards' contention that the frigate had been lost due to circumstances beyond anyone's control. \nThe court-martial was attended by William Dillon, then a midshipman, who later became a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy and described Edwards in his memoirs as a \"fine, venerable- looking officer. His appearance completely absorbed all my attention during the trial, and I felt an inward satisfaction at the result, after all the hardships and dangers he had overcome\".\n\nCaptain Edwards and his officers were exonerated and subsequently Edwards served for a few years as a 'regulating' captain (recruiting officer) in Argyll and Hull and then resigned himself to inactivity on the half pay list. However, he was promoted to vice-admiral in 1809 and eventually ended his career as Admiral of the White, titularly the third most senior officer in the Royal Navy. He died in his native place - Stamford, Lincolnshire - aged 73, in 1815. Edwards was buried in St Remigius Church in Water Newton, a village in Huntingdonshire.\n\nHis reputation and character were effectively blackened by members of the Heywood family, who were unable to forgive him for what they perceived as excessively harsh treatment of their son, \"Bounty\" midshipman Peter Heywood, who was tried and convicted as a mutineer and pardoned. Yet Edwards had staunch supporters among other officers who had served under his command and he was also remembered by his niece as a \"sweet old man\", often out on a walk in the country lanes around his native Water Newton and Uppingham where he owned several farms. According to an obituary in the \"Lincoln, Stamford & Rutland Mercury\" (21 April 1815), he suffered for the rest of his life from the effects of the hardships he endured during the open boat voyage to Timor after the loss of the \"Pandora\". This could be the reason the Admiralty never appointed him to a seagoing command after his court-martial in 1792.\n\nNotwithstanding his niece's fond memories, Edwards' conduct on the \"Pandora\" has been regarded in some circles as every bit as cruel as popular opinion claims that William Bligh was on the \"Bounty\". Edwards, as ordered, kept his captives in close confinement, as if they had already been convicted, in spite of the fact that four of them had been identified by Bligh as being innocent and were subsequently acquitted at the court martial in Portsmouth.\n\nEdwards was accused of being excessively callous when it came to the captives' well-being - for instance by refusing to let them use an old sail to prevent them from being sunburned on a sand cay, and also by collectively referring to, and treating them all as mutineers and pirates. Indeed, one of his officers, Lieutenant John Larkan (1746–1830), is alleged to have been \"brutal\" to the prisoners, which Edwards allegedly condoned.\n\nOne of Edwards' main detractors was Commodore Sir Thomas Pasley, uncle of convicted mutineer Peter Heywood, whose measured tone in one of his letters to Heywood leaves no doubt about his disapproval of 'that fellow' Edwards; he was especially critical of the prisoners' confinement in 'Pandora's Box'. Pasley omits to mention how he would have handled the situation had command been his. Presumably he might have occasionally let the prisoners out of their captivity location; thus, midshipmen Stewart and Heywood might have been allowed to spend some time walking the quarterdeck, as Peter Heywood was permitted to do after his transhipment to HMS \"Gorgon\" in Cape Town during the last stage of his voyage home. Much was made of this by Heywood’s friends and defenders during his court martial, as if to underscore their plea that Edwards' conduct towards the prisoners had been excessively harsh and that Heywood had already suffered disproportionately and therefore had, in fact, already been punished.\n\nMost damningly, Edwards is often accused of excessive callousness towards the prisoners by keeping all of them locked up in the prison cell after the frigate had run aground. Moreover, besides the fact that three prisoners were immediately ordered out of the cell to help the crew man the pumps; while several hours later, after the decision had been made to abandon ship because she could not be saved, it is not certain that Edwards gave orders to release the remaining prisoners. Some saved themselves only because Joseph Hodges, the armourer's mate, knocked off the prisoners irons, but he was not able to complete the job because the ship sank very quickly.\n\nEven though six of the captives were found guilty of mutiny, only three of them – Millward, Burkitt and Ellison – were eventually executed; William Muspratt was acquitted on a legal technicality and the remaining two, Peter Heywood and James Morrison were subsequently pardoned by the King.\n\nEdwards' search for the mutiny ringleaders ultimately proved fruitless, but his voyages might have provided clues to the fate of one of the 18th century's greatest mysteries, the fate of the Lapérouse expedition. When passing Vanikoro, Santa Cruz Islands in the Pacific Ocean on 13 August 1791, smoke signals were observed rising from the island. However Edwards, who was only interested in prisoners, reasoned that mutineers fearful of discovery would not be advertising their whereabouts, so he ignored the smoke and sailed on. Sven Wahlroos, in his 1989 book, \"Mutiny and Romance in the South Seas\", suggests that the smoke signals were almost certainly a distress message sent by survivors of the Lapérouse expedition, which later evidence indicated were still alive on Vanikoro at that time; three years after the \"Boussole\" and \"Astrolabe\" had foundered in 1788.\n\nEdwards is said to have retired to Cornwall; according to a story linking him to the 'Pandora Inn' along Restronguet Creek near Mylor, which he is alleged to have owned and renamed after retiring from the Navy. However, there is no documentary evidence to support this claim. Rather, together with a story about a figurehead adorning the Inn's stairwell, said to be based on an 18th-century original from the \"Pandora\"; this claim can be confidently refuted and relegated to the realm of creative copy-writing to advertise the inn, which according to cadastral records was called 'The Passage House' until 1851, following the death of Alexander Luben, tenant and Restronguet Passage boatman from 1823 until his death in 1848.\n"}

Ryūjin is also credited with the challenge of a hurricane that sunk the Mongolian flotilla sent by Kublai Khan.\nRyūjin lived in Ryūgū-jō, his palace under the sea built out of red and white coral, from where he controlled the tides with magical tide jewels.

It is the chief town of the province of the same name, and is noted for its buildings in shades of blue. Chefchaouen is situated just inland from Tangier and Tétouan.\n\nThe city was founded in 1471 as a small \"kasbah\" (fortress) by Moulay Ali ibn Rashid al-Alami, a descendant of Abd as-Salam al-Alami and Idris I, and through them, of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Al-Alami founded the city to fight the Portuguese invasions of northern Morocco. Along with the Ghomara tribes of the region, many Moriscos and Jews settled here after the Spanish Reconquista in medieval times. In 1920, the Spanish seized Chaouen to form part of Spanish Morocco. Spanish troops imprisoned Abd el-Krim el-Khattabi in the kasbah from 1916 to 1917, after he talked with the German consul Dr. Walter Zechlin (1879–1962). \n\nIn September 1925, in the middle of the Rif War, a rogue squadron of American volunteer pilots, including veterans of World War I, bombarded civilians in Chaouen. Colonel Charles Michael Sweeney had proposed the idea to French Prime Minister Paul Painlevé, who \"warmly welcomed the Colonel’s request.\" \n\nAfter al-Khattabi was defeated with the help of the French, he was deported to Réunion in 1926. Spain returned the city after the independence of Morocco in 1956.\n\nChefchaouen – or Chaouen, as it is often called by Moroccans – is a popular tourist destination because of its proximity to Tangier and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. There are approximately two hundred hotels catering to the summer influx of European tourists. One distinction possessed by Chefchaouen is its blue-rinsed houses and buildings.\n\nChefchaouen is a popular shopping destination as well, as it offers many native handicrafts that are not available elsewhere in Morocco, such as wool garments and woven blankets. The goat cheese native to the area is also popular with tourists.\n\nThe countryside around it has a reputation for being a prolific source of kief. The Chefchaouen region is one of the main producers of cannabis in Morocco. A nearby attraction is the Kef Toghobeit Cave, one of the deepest caves in Africa.\n\nChefchaouen's blue walls are a popular subject of interest. There are several theories as to why the walls were painted blue. One popular theory is that the blue keeps mosquitos away. The blue is said to symbolize the sky and heaven, and serve as a reminder to lead a spiritual life. However, according to some locals, the walls were mandated to be painted blue simply to attract tourists at some point in the 1970s.\n\nThe growing tourist industry is geared especially towards Spanish tourists, who are numerous during great Catholic feasts like Semana Santa and Christmas.\n\nThe city's oldest and historically most important mosque is the Great Mosque located at Place Uta Hammam at the heart of the medina. On a hill overlooking the town to the east there is also a disaffected mosque built by the Spanish in the 1920s, now a popular lookout point.\n\nAlso of great historical and religious importance to the city is the mausoleum dedicated to the patron saint of northern Morocco's Jebalah region, Moulay Abdessalam Ben Mshish al-Alami. His tomb and the village surrounding it is roughly 50 kilometers northwest of from Chefchaouen on the old road to Larache.\n\nThe beauty of Chefchaouen's mountainous surroundings are enhanced by the contrast of the brightly painted medina (old town). It is this beauty and the relaxed atmosphere of the town that makes Chefchaouen very attractive to visitors.\n\nThe main square in the medina is lined with cafes and filled to the brim with locals and tourist mingling easily. Another reason why backpackers love Chefchaouen is the easy availability of drugs. Tourism in Chaouen is driven by its reputation as center of the marijuana plantations region in north Morocco. During the summer approximately 200 hotels cater to the influx of European tourists.\n\n"}

All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies were up for election, as well as 208 of 254 seats in the Senate.\n\nThe election was held after the referendum on Spanish membership in NATO in March 1986 had resulted in a surprising win for the 'In' camp headed by Prime Minister Felipe González. Reinforced from the referendum result, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) sought to take advantage of the favorable political situation. The election resulted in the PSOE winning a second consecutive—albeit diminished—majority with 184 out of 350 seats. Its immediate competitor, Manuel Fraga's People's Coalition, an electoral alliance formed by People's Alliance (AP), the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the Liberal Party (PL), remained stagnant with a similar result to the one obtained in 1982 by the AP–PDP coalition. The disappointing election result caused the Coalition to break apart shortly afterwards.\n\nFormer PM Adolfo Suárez's Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) came out in third place with nearly 1.9 million votes, 9.2% of the share and 19 seats. The Communist Party of Spain (PCE) contested the election within the newborn left-wing United Left (IU) coalition, slightly improving on the PCE's result in 1982 with 4.6% and 7 seats and holding its own against the Communists' Unity Board (MUC), Santiago Carrillo's split party founded after him being expelled from the PCE, which won no seats.\n\nTwo future prime ministers (José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and Mariano Rajoy) were first elected as deputies at this election.\n\nThe Spanish Cortes Generales were envisaged as an imperfect bicameral system. The Congress of Deputies had greater legislative power than the Senate, having the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a Prime Minister and to override Senate vetoes by an absolute majority of votes. Nonetheless, the Senate possessed a few exclusive, yet limited in number functions—such as its role in constitutional amendment—which were not subject to the Congress' override. Voting for the Cortes Generales was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen and in full enjoyment of their political rights.\n\nFor the Congress of Deputies, 348 seats were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of 3 percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Additionally, the use of the D'Hondt method might result in an effective threshold over three percent, depending on the district magnitude. Seats were allocated to constituencies, corresponding to the provinces of Spain. Each constituency was entitled to an initial minimum of two seats, with the remaining 248 allocated among the constituencies in proportion to their populations. Ceuta and Melilla were allocated the two remaining seats, which were elected using plurality voting.\n\nFor the Senate, 208 seats were elected using an open list partial block voting, with electors voting for individual candidates instead of parties. In constituencies electing four seats, electors could vote for up to three candidates; in those with two or three seats, for up to two candidates; and for one candidate in single-member districts. Each of the 47 peninsular provinces was allocated four seats, whereas for insular provinces, such as the Balearic and Canary Islands, districts were the islands themselves, with the larger—Majorca, Gran Canaria and Tenerife—being allocated three seats each, and the smaller—Menorca, Ibiza–Formentera, Fuerteventura, La Gomera, El Hierro, Lanzarote and La Palma—one each. Ceuta and Melilla elected two seats each. Additionally, autonomous communities could appoint at least one senator each and were entitled to one additional senator per each million inhabitants.\n\nThe electoral law provided that parties, federations, coalitions and groupings of electors were allowed to present lists of candidates. However, groupings of electors were required to secure the signature of at least 1 percent of the electors registered in the constituency for which they sought election. Electors were barred from signing for more than one list of candidates. Concurrently, parties and federations intending to enter in coalition to take part jointly at an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election being called.\n\nThe term of each House of the Cortes Generales—the Congress and the Senate—expired four years from the date of their previous election, unless they were dissolved earlier. The election Decree was required to be issued no later than the twenty-fifth day prior to the date of expiry of the Cortes in the event that the Prime Minister did not make use of his prerogative of early dissolution. The Decree was to be published on the following day in the Official State Gazette, with election day taking place between the fifty-fourth and the sixtieth day from publication. The previous election was held on 28 October 1982, which meant that the legislature's term would expire on 28 October 1986. The election Decree was required to be published no later than 4 October 1986, with the election taking place on the sixtieth day from publication, setting the latest possible election date for the Cortes Generales on Wednesday, 3 December 1986.\n\nThe Prime Minister had the prerogative to dissolve both Houses at any given time—either jointly or separately—and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence was in process, no state of emergency was in force and that dissolution did not occur before one year had elapsed since the previous one. Additionally, both Houses were to be dissolved and a new election called if an investiture process failed to elect a Prime Minister within a two-month period from the first ballot. Barred this exception, there was no constitutional requirement for simultaneous elections for the Congress and the Senate, there being no precedent of separate elections and with governments having long preferred that elections for the two Houses take place simultaneously.\n\nBelow is a list of the main parties and coalitions which contested the election:\n\nFelipe González was invested as Prime Minister of Spain by the Congress of Deputies on December 2, 1982, becoming the first leftist Spanish head of government in 43 years. His party, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), had won an unprecedented landslide victory in that year's general election which opened the II Legislature, forming a majority government as a result. The Socialists' access to power raised hopes among broad sectors of the society who expected major changes, while caused concern within the more conservative circles about the measures that would be carried out. The PSOE would also achieve a massive victory in the municipal and autonomic elections of May 1983, in which it would gain control over most of the autonomous communities and provincial capitals' governments.\n\nIn its first months in power, the new Socialist government had to face a worsening economic situation: inflation was running at an annual rate of 15%, the external current account was at US$4 billion, the unemployment rate had risen to 17% by the beginning of 1983 and public deficit was at 6%, while the GDP was growing at a rate of 1.3% to the OCDE forecast of 2.5%. Miguel Boyer was named as new Economy Minister, taking first measures such as the devaluation of the peseta by 8% or the increase by 1 point of the cash reserve ratio for banks with the aim of stabilizing the current account balance for 1983. On February 23, 1983, the PSOE government expropriated the Rumasa holding due to its financial situation and because of alleged fraudulent practices and continuous evasion from the inspection activity of the Bank of Spain. Other of the government's first measures were to fulfill the PSOE's election pledge to reduce work time to 40-hour week and to establish a minimum legal annual leave of 30 days and a lunch break of 15 minutes.\n\nGonzález' government then went on to carry out an unpopular economic stabilization plan involving a process of industrial restructuring, leading to the closure of many obsolete industries and a job loss that, by 1985, would raise the unemployment rate to 21.5%. By this time, it had become obvious that the PSOE would not be able to maintain its election pledge to create 800,000 jobs in four years and, as unemployment grew, opposition parties even mocked the government about the fact that they would actually \"destroy\" 800,000 jobs. A reform of the pension system was implemented in 1985, which lengthened the period used to calculate full pension benefits from 10 to 15 years and adopted a new system for the revaluation of pensions, to be done automatically every year and in proportion to the expected inflation rate. The retirement age was maintained at 65, despite the PSOE pledge to reduce it to 64. While these plans were defended by Felipe González in that they were vital for economic recovery and an eventual economic equalization of Spain with the rest of Europe, they received widespread criticism from trade unions (including the historically Socialist-associated UGT) as well as from Socialist militants that \"could not believe that Felipe was able to do this to us\", leading to strikes and demonstrations opposing the government's economic policy. It was also during González' first term that a new labor reform was approved, which included fiscal incentives to investment, added protection for unemployed and the easing of temporality through the implementation of fixed-term contracts. In 1985, Boyer was succeeded as Economy Minister by Carlos Solchaga who, in general terms, maintained the economic policy of his predecessor.\n\nThe II Legislature (1982–1986) also highlighted the social character of the new government. In 1984 a reform of the Spanish health care system begins, culminating in the approval in 1986 of the General Health Law, which established the Spanish National Health System and settled the legal basis for universal health care in Spain, expected to reach 98% of the population according to governmental sources. The Socialists also undertook the first steps to decriminalize abortion in Spain through the Organic Law 9/1985, which allowed induced abortion in three cases: therapeutic (in case of serious risk to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman) during the first 12 weeks; criminological (cases where the woman was raped) during the first 22 weeks; and eugenic (in case of malformations or defects, physical or mental, in the fetus) at any time during pregnancy. It also established free and compulsory education until the age of 16 through the Organic Law 8/1985 regulating the right to education, and reorganized the university system, adapting it to the precepts of the Spanish Constitution of 1978, through the University Reform Law of 1983 (LRU).\n\nDuring these years, a proper electoral law was conceived, as until that time Spanish elections came regulated under provisional decrees and scattered regulation that for a long time were requested to be unified in a single text. The electoral system remained essentially the same, with the new law centering on unification of electoral legislation and the regulation of more technical issues.\n\nPrime Minister Felipe González came briefly involved in the German Flick affair in 1984, when SPD MP Peter Struck said in the German press that another MP from his party, Hans-Jürgen Wischnewski, had given 1 million Marks from the corruption plot to González himself. This led to a remarkable statement from the Spanish Prime Minister: \"I have not received a single mark, a single penny, a single peseta, neither from Flick nor from Flock\". Felipe González was later acquitted from the Flick scandal by the subsequent inquiry commission in Congress.\n\nGonzález' first term as Prime Minister was also marked by a harsh hostile campaign from ETA, with around one hundred dead throughout the 1982–1986 period as a result of terrorist activity. The Socialist government promised a \"firm reaction\" in response, with Felipe González stating in a speech November 1983 that \"This government will not allow a quiet life to those who harbor terror and crime\", announcing measures such as the aggravation of penalties for crimes of terrorism. It would be during this period and until 1987 that the GAL (acronym for \"Antiterrorist Liberation Group\") were illegally established and funded by government officials to fight ETA, starting what was to be known as the \"guerra sucia\" (Spanish for \"dirty war\"), which would be unveiled in the early 1990s.\n\nFinally, the PSOE had to deal with the issue of military insurrectionism as well. The Spanish Armed Forces were profoundly reorganized: the position of Chief of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JUJEM), which itself underwent internal reforms (including a full renovation of all of its members), was subordinated to the newly created Chief of the Defence Staff (JEMAD), in turn directly responsible to the Defence Minister, promoting an increase of civil authority over the military. It also passed into law two bills that provided, on the one hand, a reduction in the number of high-ranking officers (which was considered oversized), also allowing for long-serving officers to retire in exchange of economic incentives; on the other hand, a 15% increase in wages for members of the Armed Forces, equating military wages to the level of those from civil service personnel with similar responsibilities. Finally, the three armies (Army, Navy and Air Force) were integrated within the organizational and functional structure of the Ministry of Defence. With these reforms the Socialists intended to professionalise the Armed Forces and end the threat of military coup attempts that had lingered during the previous year, with the ultimate goal of consolidating democracy in Spain.\n\nConsidered as one of the major policy success of the first Socialist government, the Spanish entry into the European Economic Community (EEC) took place on January 1, 1986, after a long process of negotiations that had started in 1979. The integration process had been delayed as a result of several factors, among them the structure of the Spanish economy, which conflicted with European interests (especially in areas such as agriculture and fishing, motivating France to ask for a revision of the Common Agricultural Policy before Spain's accession); but also because the EEC was still undergoing budgetary internal problems resulting from the 1973 oil crisis. These factors hindered and prolonged the negotiations. However, the French position was easened after Felipe González' arrival to government in 1982, having a good relationship with also Socialist French President François Mitterrand. Spain, together with Portugal, signed the Act of Accession to the EEC on 12 June 1985 and became officially an EEC member on 1 January 1986, thus ending with a long period of isolation from Europe.\nMeanwhile, PSOE's stance on NATO came closely linked with the negotiations for Spain's entry into the EEC. The PSOE had campaigned in 1982 for the holding of a referendum on the issue after Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo's unpopular move to enter NATO in May 1982, and it had also opposed the country's permanence within the Atlantic Alliance. However, once in power Felipe González' stance evolved to one of \"support\" to NATO. According to Santos Juliá, the main factors that influenced the PSOE government's change of attitude were \"pressure from the United States and several European countries; the connection between staying in NATO and Spain–EEC negotiations and the growing favorable stance of the Spanish Defence Ministry to attain closer ties with the Alliance\". By 1985, as Spain had signed the Act of Accession to the EEC, preparations for the referendum on NATO membership started, being eventually held on 12 March 1986. Previously, González had to convince of the new government's stance to his own party in the 30th party congress held in December 1984, and the turnaround on the NATO issue led to the resignation of his Foreign Minister, Fernando Morán, in disagreement with him.\n\nDuring the referendum campaign, the PSOE was virtually left alone at the national level campaigning for NATO membership support, as the PCE (which later in the year would go on to form the United Left coalition) opposed Spain's permanence within NATO, while the main opposition AP, considered as a pro-NATO party, asked for an abstention in the referendum. In words of David Ruiz, this would be a \"painful strategy... to discredit the political career of its founder, Manuel Fraga, as an aspirant to the Government of the State\". Finally, the NATO permanence option won the vote by a surprising 53.1% to 40.3% (with 6.6% casting blank ballots), and the PSOE came out reinforced.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1982 election, the negative result, growing membership losses and a mounting debt burden ended up in the dissolution of the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) in February 1983. This left a political vacuum (with 1.4 million UCD votes in the 28 October election now virtually orphaned) that other parties attempted to occupy, namely the newly established People's Coalition (a political alliance led by People's Alliance (AP) but also comprising the People's Democratic Party (PDP), the Liberal Party (PL) and a number of regional-based parties), Adolfo Suárez's Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) or the Catalan-based Convergence and Union (CiU). It was from the People's Coalition that AP leader Manuel Fraga tried to build on his idea of the \"natural majority\": an electoral space that would bring together all political sectors from the centre and the right and all non-Socialists and non-separatists. Fraga remained confident that this strategy was the answer to an eventual victory in a general election and to forming an alternative government to the PSOE.\n\nAt the same time, Catalan politician Miquel Roca Junyent tried to enter national politics by founding the Democratic Reformist Party (PRD), supported by CiU, the Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) of Antonio Garrigues Walker, the Galician Coalition (CG), the Riojan Party (PR) and the Majorcan Union (UM), with the aim of \"capturing the 5 million votes of the political centre\". The party's founding congress took place in November 1984, and its foundation was considered a major political operation, counting with the support of different economic sectors and including some notable figures (Florentino Pérez, later to become President of the Real Madrid C.F., was named as PRD's Secretary–General), in response to the UCD collapse and the PSOE's arrival to government. The process of formation and preparation of the party to contest the next general election was to be popularly known as \"Operation Roca\", in reference to its main promoter. Meanwhile, Adolfo Suárez' CDS experienced a period of economic expansion and membership growth, and also announced its intention to enter the political arena to contest the hotly contested battle for the political centre that was now considered to exist between the PSOE to the left and AP to the right. As attempts at forming a common alliance between the three political forces failed throughout 1985, it was confirmed that all three forces would contest separately the 1986 general election.\n\nMeanwhile, the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) experienced its own internal crisis. After the devastating results of the 1982 election, party leader Santiago Carrillo resigned and was succeeded by Gerardo Iglesias. Following the XI Congress on 18 December 1983, the PCE found itself deeply divided between the three main factions within the party: the \"\"carrillistas\"\" under Carrillo, the \"\"pro-Soviet\"\" sector under Ignacio Gallego and Iglesias' \"\"renovators\"\", with the latter taking control of the party's leadership. Internal disagreements resulted in Gallego's pro-Soviet faction splitting from the party shortly afterwards, giving birth to the Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain (PCPE) in early 1984. Finally, the expulsion of Carrillo's faction from the party's Central Committee in April 1985 led to Carrillo's supporters also splitting into the Workers' Party of Spain–Communist Unity (PTE-UC).\n\nWhile the 1986 general election was initially expected for October, the opinion that a snap election would be held in June alongside the scheduled 1986 Andalusian regional election kept growing after it was known that some PSOE sectors were pressuring González for an early Parliament dissolution. Among the reasons behind an early electoral call were the party's increased popularity (according to opinion polls) after the March referendum on NATO membership, and savings worth 300 million pesetas to the State Treasury in Andalusia by avoiding the celebration of two separate elections in June and October. In early April, several government members, such as spokesperson Javier Solana, stated that \"the Executive's will is to exhaust the legislature and therefore, to hold the election in October\", while Deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra, asked on the possibility of a snap election, remained ambiguous on the issue and said that \"there are as many reasons to do so as not to, although it is normal that a party that has a majority ends the legislature\". Felipe González himself stated that he had not studied the eventuality of calling an early election for summer and that \"October is a symbolic date to be respected\", but did not deny the existence of calls within both his Cabinet and party in favor of holding an election in June. He said that his intention, nonetheless, was to \"end the legislature\". Leaders of the main opposition party, People's Alliance, were confident that a snap election would be held, arguing that \"the PSOE's program is exhausted, has no proposals to make to the electorate in the remaining months between now and October, which are all but a prolonged agony\", and also accusing the PSOE of making preparations that signaled an imminent election campaign. Finally, on April 21, Felipe González announced his intention to dissolve Parliament and call a snap election for June 22, explaining that it was his wish to prevent \"political uncertainties\" resulting from an autumn election that could affect the country's economic prospects during the making of the 1987 state budget.\n\n\nThe Spanish Socialist Workers' Party under Felipe González campaigned on a continuity platform, emphasizing on the idea of progress and trying to highlight that the party's management of government during the previous four years had been positive for the country. The democratization process after the turbulent years of the early 1980s was deemed as having been fully completed, the military insurrectionism threat had been vanquished, Spain had been integrated within Europe and the economic crisis was easening, with the brunt of the industrial conversion having been dealt with in the first years of Socialist government. It also tried to deliver on the idea that the party's programme was not yet fulfilled, with many proposals still left to be carried out. Another message of the Socialist electoral campaign revolved around the idea that a non-Socialist government would revert the political and social advances accomplished in the previous years, with PM González himself warning of a possible alternative coalition between the various centre and centre-right parties in case the PSOE lost its absolute majority.\n\nThere were notable divergences from the campaigning style of 1982: González himself, being now the Prime Minister, had a busy public agenda and was only able to participate in large campaign events during weekends, having little time to maintain direct contact with party militants. He also wanted to distance himself from direct confrontation to the other parties' candidates, usually leaving that task to Deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra and other PSOE leaders, in order to emphasize his image as Chief of the Executive. The PSOE's electoral manifesto for the 1986 election also avoided making any concrete pledges such as those done in 1982.\n\nOpposition parties had accused the PSOE government of a rudely style of ruling, of arrogance, of little austerity and of informational opacity, a result, according to them, of the large absolute majority of seats it had obtained in the 1982 election. Thus, one of the PSOE's self-imposed objectives during the election campaign was to maintain that absolute majority. In the end, the PSOE would win the election but with a significantly reduced majority of 184 seats, compared to the 202-strong majority achieved in 1982.\n\nThe People's Alliance, the People's Democratic Party and the Liberal Party contested the election in a common ticket under the People's Coalition label. Some regionalist parties in different autonomous communities, such as the Navarrese People's Union in Navarre, also joined the coalition, who was to be led into the election by AP leader Manuel Fraga.\n\nIts campaign centered into criticising the González' government record in office, accusing the PSOE of breaking many of its 1982 election pledges and asking voters to support an alternative to the Socialists, with Fraga opening the possibility to invite other parties, specially the CDS and the PRD, into a coalition government aimed at ousting the PSOE from power. The Coalition released an election programme which was described as a mixture of economic neoliberalism and social conservatism. Among the Coalition's election pledges were the privatization of public companies (the most notable example being TVE 2) and of the healthcare assistance system in order to reduce tax burden and public spending; the implementation of a national plan against drugs; the illegalization of HB and tougher penalties for terrorists (going as far as to promise an end to ETA terrorism within 6 months); a repeal of the newly approved abortion law and a revision of the divorce law.\n\nThe Coalition was criticised for its perceived right-wing stance, with serious difficulties to define an alternative policy to the PSOE, a weak opposition stance to González' government (virtually trailing the Socialists on every issue) and a lack of initiative. The Coalition's call for abstention in the March referendum (despite the party's official stance favouring Spain permanence within NATO) had been a fatal blow to its expectations in the upcoming general election, being seen, on the one hand, as a gesture of political opportunism in an attempt to weaken Felipe González' position and, on the other hand, as showing a lack of political guidance. Instead, the 'Yes' landslide victory had reinforced the PSOE in the eyes of public opinion, but the Coalition's position on the referendum was met with skepticism and disapproval from other centre-right parties, both nationally and internationally.\n\nThe roots for the United Left (IU) coalition originated during the protests to demand the exit of Spain from NATO in 1986, with the \"Platform of the United Left\". While the 1986 referendum had resulted in the country's permanence within NATO, sectors to the left of the PSOE sought to form an unitary candidacy for the 1986 general election aimed at representing the nearly 7 million voters that had shown their position against such a permanence. Aside from the PCE, which was to become IU's main member party, also joining the coalition were the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC), the Socialist Action Party (PASOC), the Republican Left (IR), the Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain or the Collective for the Unity of Workers-Andalusian Left Bloc (CUT-BAI), among others.\n\nAside from its anti-NATO stance, the IU coalition also opposed the Socialist government's recent industrial conversion, which had been carried out almost unilaterally and with little to no talks with trade unions, thanks to the PSOE absolute majority in Congress. IU campaigned on a left-wing platform, accusing the PSOE of abandoning its socialist roots and of applying liberal policies. On the international stage, IU promised to bring Spain out of NATO, the dismantling of US bases and the withdrawal of US troops from Spanish soil, as well as to counter \"the harmful consequences of integration within the EEC, a conception of Europe against the interests of multinationals and imperialism and to support initiatives for the elimination of nuclear weapons and against the militarization of space.\" On the domestic stage, IU's pledges included nationalizations in the banking and energy sectors. It also provided for large investments in the public sector, an agrarian reform and a federal model of state which provided for \"the full development of the rights of nationalities and regions\".\n\nThe 1986 election results showed little changes to the balance of power with respect to 1982. Overall, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) remained the dominant party in Spanish politics by securing a second consecutive overall majority in the Congress of Deputies. Prime Minister Felipe González was regarded to have come out reinforced from the election. With his popularity already soaring after winning the NATO referendum on March, politically turned into a plebiscite on his premiership, the election results further strengthened his political position by securing him a new mandate to continue the reforms already in place since in 1982. Nonetheless, the election unveiled the first signs of weariness of the PSOE government, as it suffered major losses in support in the major urban centers, the same that had set out the seed for González's landslide victory in 1982. In the Madrid Community the PSOE suffered the most, scoring a bare 40% from the 52% it had secured four years previously. Despite this, discontent towards the government did not translate into major inroads for other parties. Voters' apathy and the absence of strong alternatives to the Socialists translating into a substantial increase of the abstention rate, which rose to 29.5% from the 20.0% of 1982.\n\nThe centre-right People's Coalition failed to secure substantial gains from the 1982 result of the AP–PDP alliance, experiencing small gains in Castile and León, Extremadura and Melilla but falling elsewhere. Adolfo Suárez's Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) virtually took over the place of the defunct UCD with nearly 2 million votes and 19 seats. On the other hand, results for the Democratic Reformist Party (PRD) of Miquel Roca were an unmitigated disaster and a blow to Roca's national aspirations, disbanding shortly thereafter. Its Catalan counterpart Convergence and Union (CiU), however, made significant gains in the Socialist stronghold of Catalonia, dramatically closing the gap with the PSC to just 9 points from a 23-point lead in 1982. The newly formed United Left coalition was able to slightly improve over the PCE's result in 1982, despite the split of former party leader Santiago Carrillo's MUC, which was unable to gain parliamentary representation.\n\nIn the election aftermath, the People's Coalition found itself into a state of deep crisis after results showed it was unable to garner the support of the centre voters. The People's Democratic Party immediately broke away from the Coalition after the election; its 21 MPs forming their own parliamentary caucus in the Congress of Deputies, thus reducing the Coalition's parliamentary strength to 84. Manuel Fraga would resign as AP leader after the party's disastrous results in the November 1986 Basque regional election, deepening a party crisis that would last until its refoundation into the People's Party in 1989.\n"}
{"id": "2014815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2014815", "title": "Primera Junta", "text": "Primera Junta\n\nThe Primera Junta or First Assembly is the most common name given to the first independent government of Argentina. It was created on 25 May 1810, as a result of the events of the May Revolution. The Junta initially had representatives from only Buenos Aires. When it was expanded, as expected, with the addition of the representatives from the other cities of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, it became popularly known instead as the Junta Grande (\"Grand Council\"). The Junta operated at \"El Fuerte\" (\"the fort\", where the modern Casa Rosada stands), which had been used since 1776 as a residence by the Viceroys.\n\nThis Junta—officially named the \"Junta Provisional Gubernativa de las Provincias del Río de la Plata a nombre del Señor Don Fernando VII\" (Provisional Governing Junta of the Provinces of Río de la Plata in the Name of Señor Don Ferdinand VII)—allegedly meant to govern in the name of the King of Spain, while he was imprisoned by Napoleon Bonaparte. Juntas were a form of transitional or emergency government, which attempted to maintain Spanish sovereignty, that emerged during the Napoleonic invasion in Spanish cities that had not succumbed to the French. The most important for Spanish America was the Junta of Seville, which claimed sovereignty over the overseas possessions, given the fact that the province of Seville historically had enjoyed exclusive rights to the American trade. Its claims had been rejected by Spanish Americans, and its authority was quickly superseded by a Supreme Central Junta of Spain, which included American representation.\n\nWhen the Supreme Central Junta abolished itself in 1810, the politically active inhabitants of Buenos Aires saw no better moment than this to establish a local government. They had been influenced by the recent democratic and republican philosophical wave, and were also concerned about the commercial monopoly exerted by the Spanish crown, which was suffocating the local economy. Historically Buenos Aires province had partially mitigated this problem through contraband. Local politicians, such as former council member and legal advisor to the viceroy, Juan José Castelli, who wanted a change towards self-government and free commerce, cited traditional Spanish political theory and argued that the King being imprisoned, sovereignty had returned to the people. The people were to assume the government until the King returned, just as the subjects in Spain had done two years earlier with the establishment of juntas. The Viceroy and his supporters countered that the colonies belonged to Spain and did not have a political relationship with only the King. Therefore, they should follow any governmental body established in Spain as the legal authority, namely the Supreme Central Junta of Spain and its successor, the Council of Regency.\n\nThe meeting of a Buenos Aires \"cabildo abierto\" (an extraordinary meeting of the municipal council with assistance of over 200 notables from government, the church, guilds and other corporations) during 22 May 1810, came under strong pressure from the militias and a crowd that formed in front of the \"cabildo\" hall on the Plaza Mayor (today the Plaza de Mayo), up to 25 May. The crowd favored the stance of the local politicians, and the \"cabildo\" ended up creating the Primera Junta, the first form of local government in the territory that would later become Argentina. Spain would never recover its dominion over that territory. From the very beginning of the new government, two factions manifested their differences, a more radical one, whose visible leader was the Junta's Secretary, Mariano Moreno, and the conservative wing that supported the Junta's President, Cornelio Saavedra.\n\nIn general the principles of the May Revolution were popular sovereignty, the principle of representation and federalization, division of powers, the maintenance of the mandates, and publication of the government's actions\n\nPresident\n\nSecretaries:\n\nCommittee member\n\nDespite the replacement of Viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, the Royal Audience and the Cabildo stood with the authorities that existed before the revolution, who opposed the Junta since its first day. The Audience refused at first to swear allegiance to the Junta, and when they finally did, prosecutor Caspe did so with clear gestures of contempt. Caspe would be later ambushed near his home, in retaliation for this. The Cabildo imposed a time limit on the Junta: if the General Congress was not formed in six months, the Cabildo would reassume government. The Junta answered the same day, rejecting such requirements. The Audience then requested that the Junta submitted to the Regency Counsel, but the Junta refused, on the grounds that Cisneros did not so submit and the Audience did not request him to. The Audience itself swore allegiance to the Counsel shortly after, and they were all banished in response. Together with the ex-viceroy Cisneros, they were forced to take the ship \"Dart\" that left them at the Canary Islands; the exceptions were Márquez del Plata, who was at the Banda Oriental at the time, and the octogenarian Lucas Muñoz Cubero.\n\nFrom the early days of the Primera Junta there was a strong rivalry between Saavedra and Moreno. According to Ignacio Núñez, the Morenists accused Saavedra of plotting to restore the tyranny of the viceroys in his office, while the Saavedrists accused Moreno of usurping government roles that were not intended for him. Matheu would also point in his memories that the Morenists were upset because they perceived that Saavedra enjoyed receiving honors and distinctions that they had chosen to avoid.\n\nThe Junta was received with mixed reactions from the other cities of the viceroyalty. Santa Fe, Entre Ríos, Misiones, Corrientes and Mendoza supported the change, others did not. Upper Peru, which greatly benefited from the system of mita to exploit the mines in Potosi, supported the absolutist system for a long time. Javier De Elío in Montevideo denied recognition to the Junta. Paraguay was torn between supporters of either side, but royalists prevailed. However, the most immediate danger to the Junta came from Cordoba, where Santiago de Liniers came out of his retirement and started to organize an army to lead a counter-revolution against Buenos Aires. The Junta ordered Ortiz de Ocampo to stand against those counter-revolutionaries and bring the leaders as prisoners to Buenos Aires. A later ruling requested instead to execute them, but after defeating Liniers, Ortiz de Ocampo decided to ignore the latter and instead to follow the first ruling. The Junta removed Ocampo from his duty for this act of disobedience, and replaced him with Juan José Castelli. Castelli ordered the execution of the counter-revolutionaries by August, 26, with the exception of the priest Orellana. By this time, Mariano Moreno was popularly regarded as the leader of the revolution, whose resolution permitted the radical changes to the absolutist system that the Junta had managed so far.\n\nThere's some controversy among historians about the authenticity of the Operations plan, a secret document attributed to Mariano Moreno, that set a harsh government policy in the fields of economics, politics and international relations.\n\nMilitary authorities, fearing the loss of power by Saavedra, pressured the Junta to control Moreno. Moreno, on the other hand, succeeded in getting the approval of decrees that limited Saavedra and others. By December 1810 tension had reached its peak. Saavedra got the support of deputies sent by the interior provinces that had not yet been allowed to join the Junta. With this backing, Saavedra gave Moreno his most serious political setback: he forced Moreno to present his resignation on 18 December. With this resignation, the integration of the deputies from the other provinces to the Junta became possible.\n\nCreated on 25 May 1810, the Primera Junta was thus transformed on 18 December of the same year into the new Junta Grande by the introduction of representatives from other provinces of Río de la Plata.\n\nThe Primera Junta was concerned with the risk of Portuguese expansionism towards La Plata, either directly or through the Carlotist project. The diplomacy in Spain attempted to prevent the dispatch of a punitive army, limiting the armed conflicts to the royalists in Paraguay, the Upper Peru and the Banda Oriental. The Junta declared itself a natural ally of any city that revolts against the royalists; either those that did so in support of the May Revolution or those who revolted on their own (Chile, and Paraguay shortly after Belgrano's defeat).\n\nBritain, allied with Spain in the Napoleonic Wars, stayed neutral in the conflicts between patriots and royalists. Nevertheless, the British policy towards the conflict was to favour British trade as long as it did not conflict with the neutral policy.\n\n"}

The championship was the first of at least 17 championships to use that name between 1949 and 1992, as the NWA Board of Directors allowed each territory to create its own version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship if it so desired. In 1957 there were at least 13 different versions of the NWA World Tag Team Championship recognized in the United States. Since it was a professional wrestling championship, it was not won through legitimate competitive matches, but instead determined by the decisions of the booker(s) of a wrestling promotion.\n\nThe first version of the Los Angeles NWA World Tag Team Championship was created in 1949, less than a year after the NWA itself was founded. At the time, tag team wrestling was popular on the West Coast, leading to the local NWA promoters Hugh Nichols and Johnny Doyle creating the first-ever NWA World Tag Team Championship when they announced The Dusek Family (Ernie and Emil Dusek) as the first champions on July 14, 1949. The NWA Board of Directors dictated that all NWA territories recognize only one NWA World Heavyweight Champion, but allowed each territory to crown its own world tag team champion, making each championship a regional championship despite the name. The Los Angeles territory promoted its NWA World Tag Team Championship for eleven years, with Ben and Mike Sharpe being the last champions of the era. The Duseks were the only team to hold the championship twice in that period of time. The longest reign of the first era belonged to Guy Brunetti and Joe Tangero, who held the championship for at least 277 days. After the Los Angeles version was abandoned, the local promoters recognized the San Francisco version in subsequent years.\n\nBy the 1970s the San Francisco territory had been taken over by Mike and Gene Lebell's NWA Hollywood Wrestling. In June 1970 the Twin Devils (two masked wrestlers identified only as Twin Devil #1 and Twin Devil #2) were billed as the NWA World Tag Team Champions. Records are not clear on how the Twin Devils became champions; since no records of a tournament have been found, it is possible they were simply awarded the championship when the Lebells decided to reintroduce the NWA World Tag Team Championship. \"Los Brazos\" (Spanish for \"The Arms\"; Brazo de Plata and Brazo de Oro) were the last holders of the championship as NWA Hollywood Wrestling closed in December 1982.

However, Darwin himself named it the Woolnerian tip, after Thomas Woolner, a British sculptor who had depicted it in one of his sculptures and had first theorised that it was an atavistic feature.\n\nThe feature is present in approximately 10.4% of the Spanish adult population, 40% of Indian adults, and 58% of Swedish school children. This acuminate nodule represents the point of the mammalian ear. The trait can potentially be bilateral, meaning present on both ears, or unilateral, where it is present on only one ear. There is mixed evidence in regard to whether the bilateral or unilateral expression is related to population, or other factors. Some populations express full bilaterality, while others may express either unilateral or bilaterality. However, bilaterality appears to be more common than unilateral as it pertains to the expression of the trait.\n\nThe gene for Darwin's tubercle was once thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance, meaning that those who possess the allele (version of a gene) will not necessarily present with the phenotype. However, genetic and family studies have demonstrated that the presence of Darwin's tubercle may be more likely to be influenced by one's environment or developmental accidents than it is by genetics alone. There is no clear argument for whether the trait has significance in sexual dimorphism studies or age related studies. In some studies, there is clear data that Darwin's tubercle is not associated with sex. In contrast, others indicate that there is a correlation with sexual dimorphism between men and women, where men tend to have the tubercle more than women in some populations. Two studies indicate that older men tend to have greater expression of Darwin's tubercle than do older women.\n\n"}

Discovery Communications has also produced a few programs specifically for Science, such as MegaScience and What The Ancients Knew. Programs from other Discovery Networks channels, PBS and the BBC are either regularly or occasionally aired on the network. Television series produced in the 1990s, such as Discover Magazine and Understanding, are carried on the network's weekday schedule. Science also broadcasts programs such as Moments of Impact and An Idiot Abroad. The channel has infrequently added reruns of several science fiction series like Firefly, Helix and Fringe to its schedule.\n\nInternational versions of Science currently exist in Southeast Asia, Europe, France, United Kingdom, Italy, India, Sweden, Turkey, Canada, Latin America and Australia.

The present-day Kanha area is divided into two sanctuaries, Hallon and Banjar, of , respectively. Kanha National Park was created on 1 June 1955 and was designated a tiger reserve in 1973. Today, it encompasses an area of in the two districts Mandla and Balaghat.\n\nTogether with a surrounding buffer zone of and the neighbouring \n\nThe park has a significant population of royal Bengal tigers, Indian leopards, sloth bears, barasinghas and Indian wild dogs. The forest depicted in \"The Jungle Book\" by Rudyard Kipling is based on jungles including this reserve. It is also the first tiger reserve in India to officially introduce a mascot, Bhoorsingh the Barasingha (a swamp deer).\n\nKanha Tiger Reserve is home to over 1000 species of flowering plants. The lowland forest is a mixture of sal (\"Shorea robusta\") and other mixed-forest trees, interspersed with meadows. The highland forests are tropical moist, dry deciduous type and of a completely different nature from bamboo (\"Dendrocalamus strictus\") on slopes. A notable Indian ghost tree (\"Davidia involucrata\") can also be seen in the dense forest.\n\nKanha Tiger Reserve has species of tigers, leopards, wild dogs, wild cats, foxes and jackals. Among the deer species, swamp deer (\"Cervus duavcelli branderi\") or hard-ground barasingha is the pride of the place, as it is the only subspecies of swamp deer in India, except the great swamp deer of Sundarbans. The animal is adapted to hard ground unlike swamp deer of the north, which live in marshy swamps. The reserve has been instrumental in rescuing the swamp deer from extinction. Indian gaur (\"Bos guarus\"), belonging to the ox genus, are found in Kanha, but seen mostly as winter ends. In summer, gaur inhabit meadows and waterholes in the park.\n\nOther commonly seen animals in the park include the spotted deer, sambar, barking deer, and the four-horned antelope. The latter can be seen at Bamni Dadar climb. Recently, mouse deer have also been discovered in the tiger reserve.\n\nBlackbuck have inexplicably become very rare. They vanished completely, but have been reintroduced recently inside a fenced area in the park. Nilgai can still be seen near the Sarahi Gate, while the Indian wolf once commonly seen at Mocha is a rare sight now. Striped hyena and sloth bear are seen occasionally. Langurs and wild boars are common, but the pugnacious rhesus macaque is seen less often.\n\nNocturnal animals like fox, hyena, jungle cat, civets, porcupine, ratel or honey badger, and hares can be seen outside the park confines.\n\nThe reserve brings around 300 species of birds and the most commonly seen birds are the black ibis, bee-eaters, cattle egret, blossom-headed parakeets, pond herons, drongos, common teal, crested serpent eagle, grey hornbill, Indian roller, lesser adjutant, little grebes, lesser whistling teal, minivets, Malabar pied hornbill, woodpeckers, pigeon, paradise flycatchers, mynas, Indian peafowl, red junglefowl, red-wattled lapwing, steppe eagle, Tickell's blue flycatcher, white-eyed buzzard, white-breasted kingfisher, white-browed fantail, wood shrikes, and warblers, vultures among many more.\n\nReptiles such as Indian pythons, Indian cobras, krait, rat snakes, vipers, keelbacks, and grass snakes are nocturnal animals, so rarely are seen. Many species of turtles and amphibians are found in or near the water bodies.\n\nAn exciting conservation effort in this national park is the reintroduction of barasingha. The gaur will be relocated to Bandhavgarh and some barasingha will be relocated to Satpura Tiger Reserve The objective of this project is to introduce about 500 barasingha in this national park to eight or nine different locations. There is also a project to capture about twenty tigers and relocate them to Satpura Tiger Reserve.\n\nMembers of the Baiga tribe, a semi-nomadic tribe of central India that is reliant on the forest, lived in 28 villages that had been within the Kanha National Park until 1968, when they were relocated. The relocation was part of an effort to maintain a critical tiger habitat. The land to which they were relocated is barren and they now suffer from alcoholism and malnourishment, and beg to support themselves. The last of the villages to be relocated for the tiger habitat is in the core zone of the Kanha Tiger Reserve. The area is the ancestral home of the Gond and Baiga tribes.\nIn January 2010, Baiga tribe were illegally evicted from the park without proper compensation from the government, according to Survival International.\n\nIn its efforts to maintain and restore tiger habitats, WWF-India has worked to create corridors that support the tigers and their prey, thereby stabilizing the tiger population. This includes efforts to prevent loss of life or property of humans, reduce human dependency on the forest, and reduce retaliatory killings of tigers when people have experienced losses.\n\nHowever, Kanha's frontline staff continue to receive support, training and equipment from WWF, even as they carry out the eviction of the 22,000 residents who are to be forcibly resettled from tiger reserves in the region.\n\nKanha Tiger Reserve is:\n\nThe Jabalpur Airport / 04:30hrs) has direct flights to and from Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Pune, Belgaum and Bhopal, with AirIndia, SpiceJet and Indigo operating daily flights. Nagpur (Mukki and Raipur (Mukki ) have other airports.\n\nJabalpur is major railway stations with train connectivity across India. From Jabalpur, the best way to travel is via Mandla, which has a tourist taxi service to the park, and one can reach up to Chiraidongri the newly added Broad Gauge station via jabalpur, Nainpur railway route to enter national park through Kanha gate. In pre-planned journey one of shortest road route is Jabalpur-Bargi Dam-Ganhsor-Thanwar Dam-Chiraidongri-Kanha National Park. Other route Jabalpur to Mandla (via NH-30)-Chiraidongri- Kanha route is preferred when arrival permission is to be taken from National Park authority at Mandla. This National Park can also be approached from Raipur - Gandai - Malanjkhand - Baihar highway route via Mukki Gate to National Park. M.P. Tourism and Private owners has hotels, resorts near to Mukki Gate. Similar stay facilities is also available at Khatia and Kanha Gate.\n\nThere are three gates for entrance into the park. The Kanha/Kisli gate is best accessed from Jabalpur and stops at the village Khatia, inside the buffer area. The second gate is at Mukki and the third, most recently opened, gate is at Sarhi.\n\nAn economic assessment study of Kanha Tiger Reserve estimated that the tiger reserve provides flow benefits worth 16.5 billion rupees (0.80 lakh / hectare) annually. Important ecosystem services from the tiger reserve include gene-pool protection (12.41 billion year), provisioning of water to downstream regions (558 million) and provisioning of fodder in buffer areas (546 million). Other services included recreation value (384 million), provision of habitat and refugia for wildlife (319 million) and sequestration of carbon (219 million).\n\n\n\n"}

The decision was made during the initial successes of the Red Army during the Polish-Soviet War with the goal of providing administration of the Polish territories. The Committee was declared \"provisional\", because it was assumed that after a Soviet victory the power would be transferred to the Polish Communist Workers' Party.\n\nThe Polrevkom was assembled on 24 July in Smolensk, with its headquarters in an armored train, which quickly proceeded to Minsk (25 July), Wilno (27 July), and arrived to Białystok on 30 July 1920.

{"id": "2014914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2014914", "title": "Madame George", "text": "Madame George\n\n\"Madame George\" is a ten-minute song by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison. It appears on the album \"Astral Weeks\", released in 1968. The song features Morrison performing the vocals and acoustic guitar. It also features a double bass, flute, drums, vibraphone, and a string quartet.\n\n\"Madame George\" was recorded during the first \"Astral Weeks\" session that took place on September 25, 1968, at Century Sound Studios in New York City with Lewis Merenstein as producer.\n\nThe main theme of the song is about leaving the past behind. The character of Madame George is considered by many to be a drag queen, although Morrison himself denied this in a \"Rolling Stone\" interview. He later claimed that the character was based on six or seven different people: \"It's like a movie, a sketch, or a short story. In fact, most of the songs on \"Astral Weeks\" are like short stories. In terms of what they mean, they're as baffling to me as to anyone else. I haven't got a clue what that song is about or who \"Madame George\" might have been.\"\n\nVan Morrison, speaking to biographer Ritchie Yorke about the writing and meaning of the song, said in part:\n\"Madame George\" was recorded live. The vocal was live and the rhythm section and the flute too and the strings were the only overdub. The title of the song confuses one, I must say that. The original title was \"Madame Joy\" but the way I wrote it down was \"Madame George\". Don't ask me why I do this because I just don't know. The song is just a stream of consciousness thing, as is \"Cyprus Avenue\"...\"Madame George\" just came right out. The song is basically about a spiritual feeling.\n\nIn April 2007 Tom Nolan wrote an article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" suggesting that Madame George was none other than Georgie Hyde-Lees, wife of Irish poet and mystic W. B. Yeats who acted as Yeats' muse through automatic writing and inducing trances. He cites the ever-present interest in Yeats by Morrison, and the words in the song: \"That's when you fall into a trance/Sitting on a sofa playing games of chance/With your folded arms in history books you glance/ Into the eyes of Madame George.\"\n\nAn earlier recording with slightly altered lyrics and a much swifter tempo changes the tone considerably from the \"Astral Weeks\" recording, which is downbeat and nostalgic; the earlier recording is joyous, and seems to be from the point of view of a partygoer who sees the titular character. This version surfaced on the 1973 release \"T.B. Sheets\", which compiled unreleased recordings Morrison had made for Bang Records in 1967.\n\nThis song contains a number of references to places and events in Van Morrison's native Belfast: Cyprus Avenue (also the title of another song on Astral Weeks) is a tree lined, up-market residential street in east Belfast; \"throwing pennies at the bridges down below\" was a practice of Northern Irish Unionists as they travelled on the train from Dublin to Belfast where the train crossed the River Boyne (site of the Battle of the Boyne, 1690); the train from Dublin arrived in Belfast at one end of Sandy Row, a working class staunchly Unionist/Protestant street and neighbourhood. Fitzroy may be a reference to Fitzroy Avenue, a narrow residential street in Belfast between the Ormeau Road and Rugby Road.\n\nComedian Frankie Boyle suggested it was a song about Van Morrison's mother in a video on Instagram. This is suggested by the line \"With a childlike vision leaping into view\nClicking, clacking of the high heeled shoe.\" Boyle suggests this is a child walking behind his mother down the street. This, according to Boyle is why Van Morrison is so miserable, as no one understands what he is saying.\n\nThe rock journalist Lester Bangs wrote in 1979 that the song \"is the album's whirlpool. Possibly one of the most compassionate pieces of music ever made, it asks us, no, arranges that we see the plight of what I'll be brutal and call a lovelorn drag queen with such intense empathy that when the singer hurts him, we do too.\" Bangs also remarks that \"Morrison has said in at least one interview that the song has nothing to do with any kind of transvestite – at least as far as he knows, he is quick to add – but that's bullshit.\" Indeed, the lyrics contain the lines \"In the corner playing dominoes in drag/The one and only Madame George\".\n\nArtist Mark Wallinger said of \"Madame George\": \"The sense of desire and loss expressed in this song is so sad because it dares one to try to hear it again as if for the first time. It describes our exile from our past. Radical, allusive, heartbreaking, and the ultimate three-chord trick.\"\n\nIn 1974, after he had recorded eight albums, Morrison told Ritchie Yorke when he asked him what he considered his finest single track and the one that he enjoyed the most that it was: \"Definitely 'Madame George', definitely. I'm just starting to realize it more and more. It just seems to get at you... it just lays right in there, that whole track. The vocals and the instruments and the whole thing. I like that one.\"\n\nAlways a favorite of rock critics, \"Madame George\" is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and it was \nlisted as No. 467 on the All Time 885 Greatest Songs compiled in 2004 by WXPN (88.5 FM) from listener's votes and No. 356 in 2014.\n\nMadame George appears in the \"Black Boys on Mopeds\" lyrics of Sinéad O'Connor: \"England's not the mythical land of Madame George and roses\" suggesting that she is a legendary figure. David Gray pays tribute to the song on the final track of his album \"White Ladder\", with his cover version of the Soft Cell song, \"Say Hello, Wave Goodbye\", which ends similarly and even borrows lyrics \"Through the rain, hail, sleet and snow, say goodbye. Get on the train, the train and say goodbye\". In David A. Stewart and the Spiritual Cowboy's song \"Out of Reach\", from the album \"Honest\", there is a line that goes: \"Madame George got played today, she almost forgot she could feel that way\". Although not a direct imitation, the riff that the string quartet repeats at the end of the song is mimicked at the end of Bruce Springsteen's \"Born to Run\" (one of several indicators that Morrison had great influence on Springsteen), confirmed by Springsteen himself on Desert Island Discs talking to Kirsty Young. The American rock band Hat On, Drinking Wine takes their name from a lyric from the song: \"He's much older now/With hat on, drinking wine.\"\n\nWhen singer-songwriter Joan Armatrading appeared on Desert Island Discs talking to Sue Lawley on 29 January 1989, \"Madame George\" was selected as one of the eight records she would like to take to her desert island, and also as the one favoured record she would most want to save if the other seven were lost.\n\n\"Madame George\" was featured on Morrison's album \"Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl\", released in 2009 to celebrate forty years since \"Astral Weeks\" was first released.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The stellar classification is a hierarchy with solar twin being most like the Sun followed by solar analog and then solar-type. Observations of these stars are important for understanding better the properties of the Sun in relation to other stars and the habitability of planets.\n\nDefining the three categories by their similarity to the Sun reflects the evolution of astronomical observational techniques. Originally, solar-type was the closest that similarity to the Sun could be defined. Later, more precise measurement techniques and improved observatories allowed for greater precision of key details like temperature, enabling the creation of a solar analog category for stars that were particularly similar to the Sun. Later still, continued improvements in precision allowed for the creation of a solar-twin category for near-perfect matches.\n\nSimilarity to the Sun allows for checking derived quantities—such as temperature, which is derived from the color index—against the Sun, the only star whose temperature is confidently known. For stars that are not similar to the Sun, this cross-checking cannot be done.\n\nThese stars are broadly similar to the Sun. They are main-sequence stars with a B−V color between 0.48 and 0.80, the Sun having a B−V color of 0.65. Alternatively, a definition based on spectral type can be used, such as F8V through K2V, which would correspond to B−V color of 0.50 to 1.00. This definition fits approximately 10% of stars, so a list of solar-type stars would be quite extensive.\n\nSolar-type stars show highly correlated behavior between their rotation rates and their chromospheric activity (e.g. Calcium H & K line emission) and coronal activity (e.g. X-ray emission) Because solar-type stars spin down during their main-sequence lifetimes due to magnetic braking, these correlations allow rough ages to be derived. Mamajek & Hillenbrand (2008) have estimated the ages for the 108 solar-type (F8V–K2V) main-sequence stars within 52 light-years (16 parsecs) of the Sun based on their chromospheric activity (as measured via Ca, H, and K emission lines).\n\nThe following table shows a sample of solar-type stars within 50 light years that nearly satisfy the criteria for solar analogs (B−V color between 0.48 and 0.80), based on current measurements (the Sun is listed for comparison):\n\nThese stars are photometrically similar to the Sun, having the following qualities:\n\nSolar analogs not meeting the stricter solar twin criteria include, within 50 light years and in order of increasing distance (The Sun is listed for comparison.):\n\nTo date no solar twin that exactly matches the Sun has been found. However, there are some stars that come very close to being identical to that of the Sun, and are such considered solar twins by members of the astronomical community. An exact solar twin would be a G2V star with a 5,778K surface temperature, be 4.6 billion years old, with the correct metallicity and a 0.1% solar luminosity variation. Stars with an age of 4.6 billion years are at the most stable state. Proper metallicity and size are also very important to low luminosity variation.\nThe stars below are more similar to the Sun and having the following qualities:\n\nThe following are the known stars that come closest to satisfying the criteria for a solar twin. The Sun is listed for comparison. Highlighted boxes are out of range for a solar twin. The star may have been noted as solar twin in the past, but are more of a solar analog.\n\nSome other stars are sometimes mentioned as solar-twin candidates such as: Beta Canum Venaticorum; however it has too low metallicities (–0.21) for solar twin. 16 Cygni B is sometimes noted as twin, but is part of a triple star system and is very old for a solar twin at over 9 Gyr. Two solar sibling candidates (similar age, metallicity, and kinematics) are Gaia DR2 1927143514955658880 and 1966383465746413568.\n\nAnother way of defining solar twin is as a \"habstar\" — a star with qualities believed to be particularly hospitable to an Earth-like planet. Qualities considered include variability, mass, age, metallicity, and close companions.\n\nThe requirement that the star remain on the main sequence for at least 3 Ga sets an upper limit of approximately 1.5 solar masses, corresponding to a hottest spectral type of F5 V. Such stars can reach an absolute magnitude of 2.5, or 8.55 times as bright as the Sun, at the end of the main sequence.\n\nNon-variability is ideally defined as variability of less than 1%, but 3% is the practical limit due to limits in available data. Variation in irradiance in a star's habitable zone due to a companion star with an eccentric orbit is also a concern.\n\nTerrestrial planets in multiple star systems, those containing three or more stars, are not likely to have stable orbits in the long term. Stable orbits in binary systems take one of two forms: S-Type (satellite or circumstellar) orbits around one of the stars, and P-Type (planetary or circumbinary) orbits around the entire binary pair. Eccentric Jupiters may also disrupt the orbits of planets in habitable zones.\n\nMetallicity of at least 40% solar ([Fe/H] = −0.4) is required for the formation of an Earth-like terrestrial planet. High metallicity strongly correlates to the formation of hot Jupiters, but these are not absolute bars to life, as some gas giants end up orbiting within the habitable zone themselves, and could potentially host Earth-like moons.\n\nOne example of such a star is , a G5V, at temperature of 5533K, but is much younger than the sun, at 1.9 billion years old.\n\nAnother such example would be HIP 11915, which has a planetary system containing a Jupiter-like planet orbiting at a similar distance that the planet Jupiter does in the Solar System. To strengthen the similarities, the star is class G5V, has a temperature of 5750 K, has a sun-like mass and radius, and is only 500 million years younger than the Sun. As such, the habitable zone would extend in the same area as the zone in the Solar System, around 1 AU. This would allow an Earth-like planet to exist around 1 AU.\n\n\n"}

It is the sixth song on their second album \"Nevermind\", released in September 1991.\n\nOriginally titled \"Hitchhiker\" and later \"Cracker,\" \"Polly\" dates back to at least 1988. The earliest known version is a home demo featuring Cobain on vocals and guitar.\n\nThe song was first performed live on June 23, 1989, at Rhino Records in Westwood, California. It was first recorded in the studio in August 1989 by Steve Fisk at Music Source in Seattle, Washington. The sessions were for a planned EP to coincide with the band's European tour, but only two of the five songs recorded, \"Stain\" and \"Been a Son,\" were officially released, on the \"Blew\" EP later that year. On October 26, 1989, the band recorded a version during their first BBC \"Peel Session\", at Maida Vale Studios in London, England. The session, engineered by Ted de Bono, was originally broadcast on November 22, 1989.\n\nThe song was re-recorded by Butch Vig at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin in April 1990. This acoustic version, featuring Chad Channing on drums, later appeared on the band's major label debut, \"Nevermind\", released in September 1991. It was the only recording from Vig's original session with the band to appear on the album, the rest of which was recorded by Vig in May 1991 at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California. The recording features Cobain playing a five-string Stella guitar that he said he purchased from a pawn shop for $20. \"\"I didn't bother changing the strings,\"\" Cobain told Jeff Gilbert in a 1992 \"Guitar World\" interview. \"\"It barely stays in tune. In fact, I had to use duct tape to hold the tuning keys in place.\"\" Vig remembers that the guitar's \"\"strings were so old they didn't have any tone to them. A real plunky sound.\"\" Cobain's guitar and Krist Novoselic's bass were recorded live, after which Cobain recorded lead and harmony vocals, and then Channing added the cymbal crashes. \n\nAccording to Vig in the 2005 \"\" documentary, Cobain accidentally sang the first two words of the third verse, \"\"Polly said,\"\" too early, during the instrumental break, but the band decided to leave it in. However, earlier versions of the song also feature this line, including the original home demo, the 1989 Peel version, and most pre-\"Nevermind\" live versions. \n\nThe band recorded another version of the song for the BBC on November 9, 1991, at Maida Vale in London during their appearance on Radio 1's \"Mark Goodier Radio Session\". The session, their last for the BBC, was first broadcast on November 18, 1991, and three of the four songs from the session, including \"Polly\", appeared on the band's compilation album \"Incesticide\" on December 1992. This faster version of the song appeared under the title \"(New Wave) Polly.\"\n\nAn acoustic version of \"Polly,\" featuring Pat Smear on second guitar and Lori Goldston on cello, was performed during Nirvana's \"MTV Unplugged\" appearance at Sony Music Studios in New York City on November 18, 1993.\n\nThe last live performance of \"Polly\" was at Nirvana's final concert, at Terminal 1 in Munich, Germany, on March 1, 1994.\n\n\"Polly\" is an alternative rock song that lasts for two minutes and 57 seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by BMG Rights Management, it is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 122 beats per minute. \"Polly\" is composed in the key of E Minor, while Cobain's vocal range spans one octave and one note, from a low of D3 to a high of E4. The song has a basic sequence of Em–G–D–C in the verses and D–C–G–B during the refrain as its chord progression. The song starts with Cobain playing a soft, sludgy acoustic guitar riff and singing the vocals until the first chorus when bass enters, a cymbal crash is played, and Cobain adds a vocal harmony. This is done for all verses and choruses. After the second chorus the guitar stops playing and a bass break starts. The song ends with a final cymbal crash after the third chorus.\n\nCobain wrote \"Polly\" about an incident in Tacoma, Washington involving the abduction and rape of a 14-year-old girl in August 1987. Gerald Arthur Friend kidnapped the girl while she was leaving a rock concert, suspended her upside down from a pulley in his mobile home and raped and tortured her with a blow torch. She managed to escape by jumping from his truck at a gas station, attracting attention from surrounding people. Friend was later arrested and convicted for his crimes. Cobain's addition to the story was to have the victim fool the kidnapper into thinking she was enjoying what he was doing to her, causing him to let his guard down long enough for her to escape. In his 2001 biography \"Heavier than Heaven\", Charles Cross compared the song to Truman Capote's \"In Cold Blood\" in that it was written from the criminal's point of view. \n\nIn his Nirvana biography \"Come As You Are\", journalist Michael Azerrad noted that rape seemed to be a consistent theme in Cobain's songs and interviews, as if Cobain was \"apologizing for his entire gender.\" However, Cobain explained, \"\"I don't feel bad about being a man at all. There are all kinds of men that are on the side of the woman and support them and help influence other men. In fact, a man using himself as an example toward other men can probably make more impact than a woman can.\"\" Following the release and surprise success of \"Nevermind\", there were reports of a woman being raped by two men singing \"Polly.\" This appalled Cobain, who condemned the act in the liner notes to the band's 1992 compilation album \"Incesticide\", writing, \"\"last year, a girl was raped by two wastes of sperm and eggs while they sang the lyrics to our song 'Polly'. I have a hard time carrying on knowing there are plankton like that in our audience. Sorry to be so anally P.C. but that's the way I feel.\"\"\n\n\"Polly\" was ranked number 18 in \"NME's\" 2004 \"Top 20 Nirvana Songs\" list. In 2015, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it number 29 in their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs, with Julianne Sheperd writing, \"Though it's certainly not a protest song, it deftly delves into the mind of a sicko, like a succinct \"\", and is an example of the thoughtful depths Cobain was willing to plumb.\" In 2019, it was ranked at number 14 in \"The Guardian\"s list of \"Nirvana's 20 greatest songs\".\n\nAccording to \"Heavier than Heaven\", American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan was impressed with \"Polly\" upon hearing the song while at a Nirvana concert, remarking of Cobain that \"that kid has heart.\"\n\nAmerican alternative rock musician Amanda Palmer, who covered \"Polly\" on the 2011 tribute album, \"Newermind\", discussed the song in a 2011 \"Spin\" interview, saying, \"It's entirely possible that the production on \"Nevermind\" is going to feel dated in 50 years, if it doesn't already. The mystery in the lyrics to a song like ‘Polly’ is so profound. People will always be trying to make sense of what the fuck exactly Kurt was singing about. That's what makes a song last.\"\n\nThe song appears as downloadable content in the video games \"Rock Band\", \"Rock Band 2\", \"Rock Band 3\" and \"Rock Band 4\".\n\nSeveral versions of \"Polly,\" both studio-recorded and live, were released during the band's lifetime, and numerous others have been released posthumously. The following tables list all studio versions of the song, and all officially released live versions.\n"}

{"id": "2014946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2014946", "title": "1982 Spanish general election", "text": "1982 Spanish general election\n\nThe 1982 Spanish general election was held on Thursday, 28 October 1982, to elect the 2nd Cortes Generales of the Kingdom of Spain. All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies were up for election, as well as 208 of 254 seats in the Senate.\n\nThe election was called several months ahead of schedule on 27 August 1982, by the then Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, amid poor opinion poll ratings and severe infighting within his party, the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD), that had seen the splits of former prime minister Adolfo Suárez's Democratic and Social Centre (CDS), Óscar Alzaga's People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the Democratic Action Party (PAD) of former minister Francisco Fernández Ordóñez. The closing legislature had been characterized by political unstability and the effects of an economic downturn resulting from the 1979 oil crisis: Suárez himself had resigned the premiership in January 1981 as a result of the ongoing UCD crisis, a military coup d'etat attempt had been thwarted during Calvo-Sotelo's investiture on 23 February 1981, and the UCD had become increasingly isolated during the administrative set up of the so-called \"state of the autonomies\", both parliamentarily—a result of its minority status and continuous defections—and politically, having being routed in every regional election held since 1979: the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia and Andalusia. Calvo-Sotelo himself had chosen not to run for re-election.\n\nThe Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) led by Felipe González won the largest landslide victory in a Spanish democratic election, with 48.1% of the vote and a strong majority of 202 out of 350 seats in the Congress, by running a mainstream modern social democratic campaign and appealing to political change. The UCD, on the other hand, was decimated, losing 93% of its 1979 seats and roughly 80% of its 1979 vote—still the worst defeat that a sitting government has suffered since the restoration of democracy, and one of the worst defeats ever suffered by a governing party in the Western world. The right-wing People's Alliance (AP), led into the election by former Francoist minister Manuel Fraga, benefitted greatly from the UCD's losses, becoming the main opposition party to the Socialists with slightly over 100 seats and 26.4% of the vote. Adolfo Suárez's CDS had a modest entry into the Congress with 2 seats and 2.9% of the vote, while the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) vote plummeted, suffering from tactical voting to the PSOE. Turnout remains, at 79.97%, the highest ever recorded in a general election held in Spain to date. The 1982 election was the last general election to be held on a day other than Sunday.\n\nGonzález took office on 2 December, heading the first government in 43 years in which none of its members had served under Francoism.\n\nThe Spanish Cortes Generales were envisaged as an imperfect bicameral system. The Congress of Deputies had greater legislative power than the Senate, having the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a Prime Minister and to override Senate vetoes by an absolute majority of votes. Nonetheless, the Senate possessed a few exclusive, yet limited in number functions—such as its role in constitutional amendment—which were not subject to the Congress' override. Voting for the Cortes Generales was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen and in full enjoyment of their political rights.\n\nFor the Congress of Deputies, 348 seats were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of 3 percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Additionally, the use of the D'Hondt method might result in an effective threshold over three percent, depending on the district magnitude. Seats were allocated to constituencies, corresponding to the provinces of Spain. Each constituency was entitled to an initial minimum of two seats, with the remaining 248 fixed among the constituencies in proportion to their populations, at a rate of approximately one seat per each 144,500 inhabitants or fraction greater than 70,000. Ceuta and Melilla were allocated the two remaining seats, which were elected using plurality voting.\n\nFor the Senate, 208 seats were elected using an open list partial block voting, with electors voting for individual candidates instead of parties. In constituencies electing four seats, electors could vote for up to three candidates; in those with two or three seats, for up to two candidates; and for one candidate in single-member districts. Each of the 47 peninsular provinces was allocated four seats, whereas for insular provinces, such as the Balearic and Canary Islands, districts were the islands themselves, with the larger—Majorca, Gran Canaria and Tenerife—being allocated three seats each, and the smaller—Menorca, Ibiza–Formentera, Fuerteventura, La Gomera, El Hierro, Lanzarote and La Palma—one each. Ceuta and Melilla elected two seats each. The law also provided for by-elections to fill seats vacated up to two years into the legislature. Additionally, autonomous communities could appoint at least one senator each and were entitled to one additional senator per each million inhabitants.\n\nThe electoral law provided that parties, federations, coalitions and groupings of electors were allowed to present lists of candidates. However, groupings of electors were required to secure the signature of at least 0.1 percent of the electors registered in the constituency for which they sought election—needing to secure, in any case, the signature of 500 electors—. Electors were barred from signing for more than one list of candidates. Concurrently, parties and federations intending to enter in coalition to take part jointly at an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within fifteen days of the election being called.\n\nThe term of each House of the Cortes Generales—the Congress and the Senate—expired four years from the date of their previous election, unless they were dissolved earlier. An election was required to be held within from thirty to sixty days after the date of expiry of the Cortes Generales. The previous election was held on 1 March 1979, which meant that the legislature's term would expire on 1 March 1983. An election was to take place no later than the sixtieth day from the expiry, setting the latest possible election date for the Cortes Generales on Saturday, 30 April 1983.\n\nThe Prime Minister had the prerogative to dissolve both Houses at any given time—either jointly or separately—and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence was in process, no state of emergency was in force and that dissolution did not occur before one year had elapsed since the previous one. Additionally, both Houses were to be dissolved and a new election called if an investiture process failed to elect a Prime Minister within a two-month period from the first ballot. Barred this exception, there was no constitutional requirement for simultaneous elections for the Congress and the Senate, there being no precedent of separate elections and with governments having long preferred that elections for the two Houses take place simultaneously.\n\nBelow is a list of the main parties and coalitions which contested the election:\n\nThe I Legislature started with the UCD victory in the 1979 election, in which it received an increased plurality of 168 seats, but still short of an absolute majority. In his investiture speech as Prime Minister on 30 March, Adolfo Suárez outlined the main areas of his policy, including the constitutional development involving the implementation and structuring of the State of Autonomies. Subsequently, in April 1979, the first municipal elections since the Second Spanish Republic were held, in which UCD won in the overall vote tally, but lost control of the main urban centers to PSOE-PCE alliances.\n\nFrom 1979 the political situation in Spain began to deteriorate as a result of different factors. On one hand, an increase of terrorist activity by ETA, which resulted in 77 dead in 1979 and 95 in 1980, and the government's perceived inability to cope with the situation. Discontent among far-right groups with Suárez's democratic reforms resulted in the conspiration that would lead to the 23-F failed coup. The economic situation had also started to worsen after the start of the 1979 energy crisis and an increase on the oil barrel price. During Suárez's second term in office, inflation remained steady at 15% for several years, public deficit soared from 1.7% to 6% and the country's current account would register a net deficit of US$5 billion by 1980. The crisis also saw a sharp increase in unemployment, from 8.1% in March 1979 to 13.4% in March 1981.\n\nThe end of the political consensus that had dominated the Transition was confirmed with the launch by the PSOE of a tough opposition campaign. As the government was in minority status in the Congress, it was frequent for close votes to happen, with the government losing some of them at times. The harsh Socialist opposition reached a high-point in May 1980 when the PSOE presented a motion of no confidence on Suárez, with Socialist leader Felipe González accusing him and his government of \"poor handling of the economic and social situation\", as well as \"repeatedly failing to fulfill campaign promises and breaching of agreements with other political forces and within the \"Cortes Generales\" themselves\". While the motion was defeated—166 votes against, 152 in favour and 21 abstentions—it was regarded as a political victory of González. Suárez found himself politically isolated—its party being the only one voting against the motion—and the resulting debate, broadcast live on radio and later on television with high audience shares, gave González a pretext to expose the Socialist government program and to present the PSOE as a viable alternative to the UCD.\n\nGrowing division within UCD, with internal dissension and criticism gradually undermining the position of Suárez, also often resulted in the Prime Minister clashing with members of his own party. This was the result of the complex amalgamation of forces of very varying ideologies—social democrats, conservatives, liberals and christian democrats—into a party that was artificially created around the figure of Adolfo Suárez for the sole purpose of ruling. When UCD's popularity in opinion polls began to fall, internal tension began to flourish. The start of the UCD crisis would be a foreshadowing of what was to come in the later states of the I Legislature.\n\nThe adoption of the first Statutes of Autonomy in Catalonia and the Basque Country led to the first regional elections in 1980, which gave a plurality to nationalist parties (CiU and PNV) and to disappointing results for UCD. Both Statutes were approved by the Catalan and Basque citizens through referendums with wide margins, complying with the procedure provided in article 151 of the Constitution for the \"fast route\" of accessing to autonomy, which allowed for an immediate assumption of full competences. The article 151 procedure was initially thought just for the three \"historical nationalities\" that had approved a \"Statute of Autonomy\" of its own during the Second Spanish Republic – namely, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia (which would see its own Statute approved in 1981) – while the rest would accede to autonomy via article 143, assuming fewer powers through a slower and longer process and maybe not even establishing institutions of self-government.\n\nAndalusia representatives, however, were firmly opposed to this and demanded for their region the maximum level of competences granted to the \"historical nationalities\". After a massive rally in support of autonomy held on 4 December 1977, a referendum was accepted to be organized for Andalusia to attain autonomy through the strict requirements of article 151, which required that in all of the provinces that were to constitute the new autonomy the 'Yes' had to win the support of over half of \"registered voters\". The UCD, which was opposed to Andalusia accessing autonomy through article 151, called for abstention in the referendum, with the PSOE calling for a vote in favour. Eventually, in one of the eight provinces, Almería, the requirement of more than half of registered voters voting in favour was not met because of a high abstention, despite an overwhelming victory for the 'Yes' in Almería and the remainder of Andalusia. After several months of discussion, Adolfo Suárez and Felipe González reached an agreement whereby the Congress would approve an amendment allowing for Andalusia to take the \"fast route\" and have its Statute approved. As part of the agreement, no other region would use the procedure of article 151, but in exchange, all future autonomous communities would be allowed to establish a parliamentary system with all institutions of self-government. These 'autonomic pacts' between UCD and PSOE would later be formalized with the approving by Congress of the \"Organic Law of Armonization of the Autonomic Process\" (known by its acronym, LOAPA) in July 1982. The LOAPA provided for the devolution of competences to take place gradually, according to the ability of each region to assume them, so that in the end all of them possessed the same level of competences. The Law, however, was challenged as unconstitutional by the Catalan and Basque nationalists, with 14 out of its 38 articles being later invalidated by the Spanish Constitutional Court in August 1983.\n\nHowever, the UCD image in Andalusia would remain seriously damaged from this point afterwards as a result of the party's opposition to the application of article 151. The UCD was also accused during the referendum campaign of obstructing the ratification process of the Statute and of failing to offer the needed democratic guarantees for the referendum's celebration. This, coupled with the ongoing national crisis affecting the party, would result in the UCD being nearly wiped out in the first Andalusian regional election of May 1982, in which the party would fall below 15% to a discreet third place. The PSOE, on the other hand, became very popular, seen as the party defending the Andalusian people's interests, and would become the dominant force in the region from that point onwards.\n\nThese factors combined with an increasing political isolation and alleged pressures from military sectors led to Adolfo Suárez announcing his resignation as Prime Minister and party leader on 29 January 1981. In his resignation speech Suárez did not elaborate on the reasons motivating his departure; only that he thought that his resignation was \"more beneficial to Spain than his stay in the Presidency\" and that he \"did not want the democratic system to be a parenthesis in the history of the country\". Proposed as his successor was Second Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo. It was rumoured that high-ranking military officials would have advised King Juan Carlos I to dismiss Suárez as a result of growing discontent with him from former ruling far-right sectors, the military and Suárez's party itself, though this was not confirmed.\n\nUpon Suárez's resignation, events rushed. On 1 February, the Almendros Collective published a pro-coup article in the \"El Alcázar\" far-right newspaper; from 2 to 4 February, the monarchs visits the Basque Country, where Herri Batasuna MPs receive them with strong booing and several incidents, and on the same week, several people were found kidnapped or murdered by ETA. Amidst this tense climate, UCD's 2nd party congress is held from 6 to 9 February, where the party was internally divided. Agustín Rodríguez Sahagún was elected as new party President, and on 10 February Calvo-Sotelo was confirmed as PM candidate for the investiture vote to be held on 20 February. Calvo-Sotelo, however, was unable to command the required absolute majority of votes in the first round; as a result, a second round was postponed to 23 February.\n\nIt was in that day, during Calvo-Sotelo's investiture, that the different coup plots that had been plotting since the beginning of the Transition met in a coordinated action in what was known as the 23-F coup d'etat attempt. A group of Guardia Civil members under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Tejero assaulted the Congress of Deputies, kidnapping both the legislative and executive power within. At the same time, Lieutenant General Jaime Milans del Bosch ordered tanks onto the streets of Valencia and decreed a state of emergency.\n\nThe attempt eventually failed, however, as it did not count with the military's support. Key was King Juan Carlos I's role, broadcasting a message to Spaniards reassuring them of his personal opposition to the coup and his commitment with democracy and ordering the military rebels to stand down and surrender to constitutional order. Afterwards, Calvo-Sotelo was elected new Prime Minister with 186 votes, gaining the temporary support of CiU, the PAR and the entirety of AP as a result of the coup.\n\nLeopoldo Calvo-Sotelo's one-year term in office was marked by several events which further undermined UCD's electoral base. The colza oil scandal of 1981, in which the illegal marketing of denatured rapeseed oil (intended for industrial use) for food purposes resulted in the mass poisoning of 20,000 people and the death of over 600. The legalization of divorce in mid-1981 met with criticism from the Catholic Church and the most conservative sectors within the UCD, which even demanded the resignation of Justice Minister Francisco Fernández Ordóñez, promoter of the law. The schism within UCD kept growing even after Suárez's departure from its leadership and desertions began to intensify. By early 1982, the UCD's parliamentary group was reduced to 164 in the Congress from 168 in the 1979 election (and with many within the group not following the party-line) and 108 in the Senate (out of the 121 it was entitled to), after Fernández Ordóñez split with his Democratic Action Party (PAD). By this point, defections and splits had begun to take a toll on the government's ability to win parliamentary votes, resulting in events such as the UCD defeat in the 1982 budget voting. Sotelo would assume full leadership over the UCD on 21 November 1981, succeeding Rodríguez Sahagún as party president.\n\nAlso during Calvo-Sotelo's tenure, Spain negotiated and accomplished its integration within NATO in May 1982. This move was met with the staunch opposition of the parliamentary left, headed by Felipe González' PSOE, which promised to hold a referendum on the issue if it ever came to government. But it also caused a rift between Calvo-Sotelo and former PM Adolfo Suárez, still a UCD MP, on the grounds that the incumbent Cabinet had not been duly informed of the possible consequences of an eventual Spanish entry into NATO, as well as the haste and rush with which the integration process was being carried out.\n\nOn 20 October 1981, the first Galician regional election was held. Seen as an UCD stronghold after its landslide wins in the region in both the 1977 and 1979 general election, the UCD was predicted an easy win, despite the already-expected loss in support. However, voters' weariness with the UCD's internal crisis and its management of the country resulted in a surprise win for the right-wing People's Alliance on an extremely low turnout (46.3%). While AP's victory was narrow (a 3-point margin), the result evidenced the enormous loss of support for the UCD in the urban areas and how AP was beginning to capitalize on its losses. This was followed by the party's collapse in the 23 May 1982 Andalusian election; garnering only 13% of the votes (from 32% in 1979) and also surpassed by AP, it was considered a disaster for the party. The dimensions of the electoral setback were unassailable (loss of 60% of its 1979 vote and displaced by AP as the main referent of the right in Spain's most populated region) and it had happened even after many of Calvo-Sotelo's Cabinet members had personally committed themselves to the election campaign (with up to 10 Ministers and Prime Minister Calvo-Sotelo himself publicly supporting the UCD candidate in Andalusia, Luis Merino). The national implications of the electoral results could not be ignored as the UCD had tried to do in Galicia, and the effects in national opinion polls were immediate; from that point onwards, the UCD began to trail both AP and the PSOE and was relegated to third party status.\n\nThe Andalusian election debacle paved the way for the party's final decomposition in the run up to the next general election. Calvo-Sotelo announced in July 1982 his intention not to run as his party's main candidate for the premiership and resigned from the UCD presidency, but remained as Prime Minister. Replacing him as party candidate and leader was Landelino Lavilla, elected with a strong internal opposition (with the support of only 67% despite being the only party candidate). Concurrently, the UCD's continuous splits in the Congress (with its parliamentary group reduced to 150 out of 350) had, by the summer of 1982, deprived the party of a workable majority to govern until the end of the legislature in 1983, causing Calvo-Sotelo to announce the Cortes' dissolution and the call of a snap election for 28 October before the Parliament's reopening in September. Bill proposals such as the Statutes of Autonomy of Madrid, the Balearic Islands, Castile and León and Extremadura or the 1983 budget, scheduled to be approved throughout the autumn, had to be delayed until after the election as a result.\n\nAdolfo Suárez, himself the UCD's founder, staged one of the most remarkable splits by founding the centrist Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) and announcing his intention to run on its own in the next general election. Also splitting from UCD was the new christian democrat People's Democratic Party (PDP) of Óscar Alzaga, which would run in coalition with AP. Had the Cortes reopened in September after the holidays as it was initially scheduled, the UCD parliamentary group in the Congress would have been down to 124, even less than an hypothetical sum of the PSOE and PAD parties (128 seats).\n\nOne of the most discussed issues in the road to the 1982 general election was the parties' policy of electoral alliances. Fernández Ordóñez' PAD had already reached an agreement by the spring of 1982 to run under the PSOE banner, while talks for an eventual AP–PDP coalition were underway already before the Cortes' dissolution, being confirmed in early September. Initially confirmed was also the nationwide coalition between the UCD and the Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) of Antonio Garrigues Walker under the UCD banner; the PDL having been founded in July amidst the internal crisis of UCD. However, the UCD–PDL alliance broke apart because of \"technical differences\" in the making up of electoral lists, with the PDL opting for not contesting the election. Some sectors within UCD had also tried to ally itself with Suárez's CDS with little success as a result of the latter's refusal, with the UCD's general reluctance against any electoral coalition in which it was not dominant causing new internal clashes within the party, as the belief of it heading towards election defeat increased.\n\nThere were also voices within the party calling for a nationwide coalition with Manuel Fraga's AP, which was rejected by the party's leadership, although a coalition at the regional level between both parties for the Basque Country was confirmed on the basis of \"exceptional circumstances\" existing in the territory. People from the business and banking world, concerned about an hypothetical victory of the PSOE with an absolute majority, also voiced their support for an UCD–AP coalition, criticizing the centrists' rejection of such an agreement, while Manuel Fraga was confident in that \"the natural majority [an hypothetical union of the Spanish centre-right electorate] will be realized, either from above or from below\". However, Lavilla wanted to distance himself and his party from the right and appeal to the centre of the political spectrum, viewing AP as too right-wing for that purpose.\n\nDuring the first days of October, preparations for a coup d'etat attempt scheduled for 27 October (on Election Day's eve) were unveiled and foiled. The plan was to stage a number of violent actions against different personalities, to culminate later with a great explosion in a block of military houses in Madrid. This would be blamed on ETA and the inefficiency in the fight against terrorism as a means to justify a military takeover. The importance of the coup attempt was downplayed by the media in order to avoid raising social unrest, and it hardly affected the election campaign starting on 7 October. PSOE Vice Secretary-General Alfonso Guerra, however, would state that the incorporation of the Army to democracy was to be one of the goals of a future PSOE government.\n\nThe Spanish Socialist Workers' Party centered its campaign on the perceived need for a political change in the Spanish government. Unlike the 1977 and 1979 campaigns, the PSOE resorted to a catch-all party strategy, presenting itself as the \"only effective alternative to UCD\". It used a single, simple and catchy slogan (\"For change\"), meant to simplify the party's message as well as to transmit confidence in the new government. Raised fists and singing of The Internationale also disappeared from PSOE's rallies. Instead, seeking to move away from its traditional left-wing stance and to appeal to a broader electorate through a more centrist platform, the party usually ended its rallies with a jingle (\"We must change\") centering on the message of \"change\". The PSOE also relied in a strong personalization around the figure of Felipe González, appealing to ethics and messages of hope as drivers of the political change, but also to show an image of party unity in contrast to the UCD's internal infighting of the previous years. The party's final campaign rally on 26 October, held in the University City of Madrid, was estimated to have gathered roughly half a million people.\n\nAmong the PSOE election pledges were the creation of 800,000 employments, the nationalization of banks in a critical economic situation and the decrease of retirement age from 69 to 64, as well as to establish the maximum working time at 40-hour week. It also proposed a wide range of social policies: raising taxes to higher incomes, increasing lowest-earning pensions, promotion of public companies, to increase control and monitoring of companies by workers, to expand unemployment insurances and to reduce social inequality through the social security. Regarding NATO, the PSOE was also a staunch advocate of Spain's exit from the organization, though eventually it would defend a 'Yes' vote in the 1986 referendum on NATO membership.\n\nLeading all opinion polls and fresh from its success in the May Andalusian regional election, the PSOE was widely expected to win the election; its victory being so assured that all other parties' efforts were directed towards avoiding a Socialist absolute majority so that it had to govern through coalitions or agreements, rather than in winning the election themselves.\n\nThe Union of the Democratic Centre tried to campaign focusing on the values of the centre against the alleged radicalism of the PSOE and AP, the two of them had begun to polarize the political scene by 1982.\n\nNonetheless, the UCD campaign was plagued by organizational problems. No proper campaign chief was named, the messages were varied and confusing and the economic waste, despite being the best-funded campaign, was deemed unaffordable given the electoral prospects. No attempt for simplification of the party's message was made; their proposals consisting of dense and long texts to the simpler and more effective slogans of the other parties. Incumbent Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo was mostly left out from the party campaign, and defections to other parties as well as the refusal to form a broad centre-right coalition with AP had left the UCD in a weak position to voters. Landelino Lavilla was also deemed to have poor public performances: in an opinion article published during the campaign on the \"Cambio 16\" magazine it was noted how Lavilla's speeches were unable to incite any euphoria or to make clear any ideas.\n\nOverall, the party campaign was criticised as having been carried out with reluctance and lack of conviction.\n\nThe People's Alliance and the People's Democratic Party ran in a common ticket for this election, in what would be a foreshadowing of the future People's Coalition from 1983 to 1986. The coalition's communication strategy for the campaign revolved around two main ideas: emphasis on Manuel Fraga's leadership and in the coalition as the only viable alternative to the PSOE. The coalition strategy was also meant to present itself as an example of political cooperation, contrasting with UCD's disintegration. All in all, the purpose of the AP–PDP ticket was to turn itself into the main centre-right reference force of Spain. Manuel Fraga was also concerned in moderating his right-wing stance, avoiding themes such as death penalty or constitutional reform.\n\nAmong AP's election pledges were a tax reduction consisting in the suppression of the wealth tax, exemption from the income tax (IRPF) for incomes lower than 750,000 yearly pesetas, deduction of any economic amount intended for productive investments and the setting of an upper limit to individual tax burden. It also proposed the political immunity of Administration officials against successive government changes and a partial privatization of the social security system so that only the most basic levels of attendance would be maintained generally, with other benefits depending on what users paid (but providing extensions for the person attending home in each family and to young people unable to find employment after completing their studies). Finally, it advocated for completing the integration of Spain into NATO, ensuring full employment and to guide the cultural policy under christian humanism.\n\nAfter its success in the 1981 Galician and 1982 Andalusian regional elections, all opinion polls pointed to AP becoming the main Spanish opposition party, but at a great distance from the PSOE.\n\nWith a record high turnout of 79.97%, the Spanish political landscape underwent an electoral earthquake. The ruling UCD was devastated; it lost 157 seats and fell to 11, a 93.5% loss from 1979. In terms of votes, it went from 6.3 million down to 1.4 million, a loss of 4.9 million votes or 77.8% of its 1979 vote, and plunged to 6.8% of the share to the 34.8% it had won in 1979—a loss of 80.5% of its share. Of its 11 seats, 5 were obtained in Galicia, 3 in Castile and León, 2 in the Canary Islands and only 1 in Madrid, winning no seats in all other regions. Incumbent Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, which stood in second place in the Madrid list, lost his seat—the only time in recent Spanish history that a sitting Prime Minister seeking re-election as MP was unseated. It was the worst defeat, both in absolute terms and in terms of percentage of seats lost, for a ruling party at the national level in Spain, and one of the worst defeats ever suffered by a governing party in any country at the time, rivaling only with the collapse of Christian Democracy at the 1994 Italian election or the Progressive Conservatives' downfall at the 1993 Canadian election.\n\nThe PSOE swept the popular vote in nearly all regions of the country—only AP and PNV wins in Galicia and the Basque Country denied them a clean sweep of the entire national territory. They won a majority of seats in every region but Galicia, La Rioja and the Balearic Islands, and obtained an astounding 60% in Spain's most populous region, Andalusia—a feat never to happen again. In Catalonia it obtained a 23-point lead over the second most-voted party, a result that would only be surpassed by the PSOE's own result in the 2008 election. Andalusia and Catalonia would become from that point onwards as the main strongholds of PSOE support, which was to remain the dominant political force in both regions in each general election until 2011. Overall, the PSOE won 202 seats—its best historical performance and the best performance of any party in a Spanish general election. This gave them an overwhelming majority in the Congress, nearly doubling the seat-count of its immediate competitor. The PSOE was also the only party to win seats in every district, the first of only three times since the Spanish transition to democracy that this has happened—the other two being PP results in the 2000 and 2011 elections.\n\nThe AP-PDP coalition had a major breakthrough, gaining a substantial portion of UCD previous support, displacing it as the main party to the right-of-centre in Spain and becoming the country's main opposition party. Despite only topping the polls in Galicia, its results elsewhere where still considered impressive for a party that, in the 1979 election, had only obtained 6% of the vote and 9 seats. It obtained 107 seats—despite opinion polls predicting that it would be well-below the 100-seat mark—and climbed up to 5.5 million votes. It did not win any seats, however, in the districts of Ceuta and Melilla, which essentially worked under a FPTP system. The AP-UCD-PDP coalition in the Basque Country won 2 seats, 1 each for Álava and Biscay, being left out from Gipuzkoa. It would also be the only one of three times that AP and its successor, the PP, would win a seat in the district of Girona.\n\nThe PCE suffered from PSOE's growth, falling from 23 seats to 4—a loss of 82.6%—and losing 1.1 million votes to 850,000 —a loss of 60%. Furthermore, it fell to 4.02% of the share, from 10.8% in 1979. As a result of not reaching the required 5% threshold and 5 seats to obtain a parliamentary group in Congress of its own, the PCE was forced into the Mixed Group, with the fear of becoming an extraparliamentary party at the next election remaining for the entire legislature. On the other hand, nationalist parties such as PNV and CiU benefitted from the UCD's collapse and enlarged its political representation. CiU gained 4 seats for a total of 12, placing among the top two in Catalonia, a first in a general election since 1977.\n\nThe 202-strong PSOE absolute majority would come to be known as the \"roller\" (\"rodillo\" in Spanish), in reference to the party's overwhelming parliamentary power. Any bill submitted by González' government was assured to be approved by Congress, with the parliamentary process of law-making and approval turning into a mere formality.\n\nThe October 1982 general election led to a major reconfiguration of the Spanish political scene. While institutionally, the Spanish transition to democracy ended in December 1978 after the approval of the 1978 Constitution in referendum and its subsequent adoption, historically the transition is considered to have ended with the 1982 election. The threat of a military coup d'etat after the failed 23-F coup had effectively ended, after preparations for the 27-O coup attempt were foiled. The election's aftermath ensured a lasting political stability that would favour the implementation of reforms that would definitely settle democracy in Spain. Furthermore, the exceptionally high turnout (80%) was seen as a strong endorsement by the Spanish people on the democratic system, and the political earthquake resulting from the election was deemed as the Spaniards' desire to break up with the past and to look into the future, rallying behind the PSOE and the \"for change\" premises it had campaigned for.\n\nThe UCD, the political party which had led the country into the transition from Francisco Franco's dictatorship into a fledgeling democracy, was not only ousted from power, but almost entirely decimated in the election. From the 35% of the share and 168 seats it had obtained in 1979 it was reduced to a mere 7% and 11 seats. It had lost 4.9 million votes in its last three years in power (roughly 80% of its 1979 voter base) and was left as a third party with no ability to influence the government. As a result, the UCD, which had been in office since its inception in 1977 until December 1982, effectively ceased to exist as in February 1983, when its leadership decided to dissolve the party as it was unable to cope with the mounting debts. Its collapse was seen with time as the result of the voters' perception of it not acting with consistency, clarity and effectiveness, and because of the internal party division and infighting that plagued the UCD's final time in power.\n\nThe PSOE won the election in a landslide with a large absolute majority of seats and roughly half (48.1%) of the vote share. With 202 out of the 350 seats at stake in the Congress and 134 out of the 208 electable seats in the Senate, it won roughly 60% of the seats in each chamber, a record result not surpassed ever since by any political party. Its 10,127,392-vote result, comprising 38% of the voting-able electorate at the time, was not reached by any party until the 2000 general election held 18 years later, when the PP obtained 10,321,178 (however, as the voting-able electorate was much larger in 2000, that result was not as lopsized in percentage terms as it was in 1982). For the next decade, the Socialists would dominate Spanish politics with no other party having a realistic chance of forming government, leading some commentators to suggest that Spain had moved to a dominant-party system. Eventually, the PSOE would not be seriously challenged until 1993, when they were reduced to a minority government, remaining in power for another 3 years until 1996. To date, Felipe González' 1982–1996 stay in power (four terms comprising 14 years) remains the longest period of continuous government by a democratically elected PM, with governments ever since usually having shorter durations of 8 years (two terms).\n\nThe People's Alliance became the major opposition party as a result of this election, having been a minor party in the 1977–1982 period. For most of the four decades since then, it has been the main non-socialist party in Spain. However, despite its position as the main alternative to the PSOE, its perceived right-wing stance, subsequent internal crises and leadership changes, as well as the PSOE enduring popularity until the early 1990s, ensured the party would remain electorally stagnant throughout the decade. AP would also face the direct competition of Suárez's CDS in the 1986–1989 period, which for some time was even expected to surpass AP as the PSOE's main rival. The party position would not improve until its relaunch as the People's Party in 1989 and the leadership of José María Aznar, which would eventually led to the establishment in 1993 of a two-party system in Spain, and in the PP's rise to power in 1996.\n"}

In 1997, Pacific Media Corporation (which was principally controlled by Judge Robinson O. Everett of Wilmington, North Carolina) entered into a local management agreement (LMA) with a subsidiary of Lambert Broadcasting. That company split the translator off and relaunched it as a separate Fox affiliate serving the Coachella Valley.\n\nOn August 23 of that year, the station moved to UHF channel 33 and adopted KDFX-LP as its call sign. The LMA and options to purchase the two stations were sold a year later to the News-Press Gazette Company of St. Joseph, Missouri. Lambert invested heavily in the station and upgraded it to Class A status on April 7, 2003, as KDFX-CA. In May 2008 with the operational options running out, that owner officially bought the stations for $2 million. Since that company was already controlling KESQ in Palm Springs, the transaction made KDFX a sister outlet to the ABC affiliate.

It was a family of modest means but studious inclinations; one of his three brothers, C. H. Dodd, achieved particular distinction as a New Testament scholar. Having attended Grove Park Grammar School in the town he went up to New College, Oxford in 1911, and after graduating in history, joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (2nd West Lancashire Field Ambulance) in 1914 with whom he saw active service in France.\n\nDodd was appointed lecturer in history at University College, Bangor in 1919, and succeeded Sir John Edward Lloyd as professor of history there in 1930, a post he retained until his retirement in 1958. He also taught in the Extra-Mural Department, and was stalwart of the WEA (Workers' Educational Association) and the Cambrian Archaeological Association. In retirement he was curator of Bangor Museum, and taught at Bangor Normal College (now part of the University of Wales, Bangor).\n\nHe was a founder member of the Denbighshire Historical Society and edited a history of Wrexham to coincide with the Borough Centenary Celebration in 1957. He was made a freeman of the Borough of Wrexham in 1963. A centenary celebration of his birth was held in Wrexham in 1991.\n\nThough not a native speaker, Dodd was a supporter of the Welsh language and brought up his children as Welsh speakers, at a time when the language had far less social status than now.\n\n"}

{"id": "2015016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015016", "title": "Psion (comics)", "text": "Psion (comics)\n\nThe Psions are a fictional extraterrestrial species in the DC Universe. The Psions first appeared in \"Tales of the New Teen Titans\" (vol. 1) #4 (September 1982) and were created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez. The earliest uncredited appearance of the Psions was in \"The Witching Hour\" #13 (March 1971) written by Marv Wolfman.\n\nBillions of years ago, on the planet Maltus, the Maltusian immortals studied all aspects of life. They took a local reptile for testing and discovered one part of the lizard's mind had the potential for much greater complexity. They enhanced the creatures and found the new developments were passed to each succeeding generation. The reptiles were released back into the wild to chart their survival rate.\n\nThe Maltusians eventually left their world in a great exodus. The enhanced reptiles evolved into the Psion race. The early Psions investigated the Maltusian labs and mimicked their creators. They went as far as cutting off their tails to look more like the Maltusians (and, as a result, disavowing their original background). After several millennia, the Psions left Maltus to follow their creators, now known as the Guardians of the Universe, who were on Oa.\n\nWhen the two discovered each other, things were not quite what the Psions expected. The Oans regretted their decision not to destroy their equipment before leaving Maltus. The Psions wished to learn more from the Guardians, but were forbidden to travel to Oa. Though the Psions had mastered the technology, they had gained little understanding. The Guardians felt responsible for the Psions and sent them to a distant galaxy where they could strive for comprehension. The Guardians ordered the Psions to stay within their assigned area so they would not be disturbed. The Guardians hoped the Psions would achieve their own greatness. The Green Lantern Corps would not be allowed to interfere with the Psions as part of the process. The Guardians' great hope has not come to fruition.\n\nDiscovering their creators and then feeling humiliated by the same, the Psions buried the truth. As a species they forgot their background and began anew their scientific work. As scientists, the Psions asked the questions all thinkers ask, such as \"Where are we from?\" Again and again, the Psions discovered the truth about their origins, and every time they suppressed the knowledge. The Psions refuse to acknowledge that their creators did not want them or believe in them. When hearing the truth, in pain, they go into shock and incapacitate themselves. This process also suppresses their knowledge of their genesis.\n\nThe Psions were among the many alien races that took part in invading Earth after the Dominators became worried about humanity's ability to produce super-powered individuals. Part of their contribution to the war effort included creating sedatives for prisoners in the Gulag that the Alliance maintained in deep space. A science team also worked out of Alliance Headquarters in conquered Australia. This team was killed when an effort to send a bomb through a JLI transporter backfired.\n\nA Psion was part of the Paradocs crew during the \"Our Worlds at War\" crossover. While helping tend to a gravely injured Wonder Woman, he openly stated she was most likely beyond saving and that he should start dissecting her. Fortunately, Hippolyta took over treatment for her daughter.\n\nThe Psions maintain vast floating laboratories where studies continue. There they exploit the life forms they found in the Vegan star system. Working with their science, they created the many species of Vega's twenty-five worlds, subconsciously replicating their own origins. Active against them are the Omega Men, an interstellar group of rebels drawn from the Vegan worlds. Psion experiments accidentally created the Vegan goddess X'Hal. The Green Lantern Corps has been barred from entering or interfering within the Vegan star system due to an ancient pact with the Spider Guild. However, it is revealed in the fourth law of the rewritten book of Oa by the Guardians of the Universe that the Vega System is no longer outside of Green Lantern Corps' jurisdiction.[10] \n\nGreen Lanterns Kyle Rayner and Guy Gardner planned to breach Vegan space in order to retrieve recruit Soranik Natu. The mission was successful, thanks to the skills shown by Soranik, leading to the defeat of the Spider Guild.\n\n"}
{"id": "2015018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015018", "title": "Broadband Global Area Network", "text": "Broadband Global Area Network\n\nThe Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) is a global satellite network with telephony using portable terminals. The terminals are normally used to connect a laptop computer to broadband Internet in remote locations, although as long as line-of-sight to the satellite exists, the terminal can be used anywhere. The value of BGAN terminals is that, unlike other satellite Internet services which require bulky and heavy satellite dishes to connect, a BGAN terminal is about the size of a laptop and thus can be carried easily. The network is provided by Inmarsat and uses three geostationary satellites called I-4 to provide almost global coverage.\n\nDownlink speeds of high-end BGAN terminals are up to 492 kbit/s and upload speeds are also up to 492 kbit/s - Best Effort as BGAN Background IP (BIP) is a contended (shared) channel. As with all geosynchronous satellite connections, latency is an issue. Common latency is 1–1.5 seconds round trip for the Background IP service. It is slightly better for the Streaming services at 800 ms – 1 second. This latency is mainly due to the great distance that has to be traveled before a packet can reach the Internet, but is slightly exacerbated by the back-end technology as normal latency over a Very small aperture terminal (VSAT) system is roughly 550 ms. BGAN users frequently use PEP software or other TCP packet accelerators to improve performance, and the BGAN user is often assigned a non-routable IP address and routed through a NAT server; this increases security and helps control usage costs.\n\nBGAN terminals are made by multiple manufacturers. They all have similar capabilities. The main two that apply to basic BGAN usage are the Standard Background IP (Internet) and Telephone Voice. Data costs from the many ISPs that offer BGAN service average about per Background Megabyte. Voice calling is on average US$1 per min and varies slightly based on the destination of the call (Land lines, Cell phones, other Satellite phones which are the most expensive).\n\nBGAN can be easily set up by anyone, and has excellent voice calling quality. It uses the L band, avoiding rain fade and other issues affecting satellite systems operating at higher frequency bands.\n\nThe actual process of connecting a BGAN terminal to the satellite is fairly straightforward. The BGAN terminal needs to find its position using GPS, before it can negotiate with the satellite, so a clear view of the sky is necessary to begin with. Once the GPS position is obtained, it does not need to do that again unless it is moved to a different region. Obtaining the initial GPS position can take a few minutes. The terminal then needs a line-of-sight to the geostationary satellite so a user would normally be outside, and have a general idea of what direction the satellite would be (with a compass if necessary). Turning the terminal slowly by hand, it will give some indication when the satellite is found. Then usually with the touch of one button, the terminal auto-negotiates with the satellite and connects. The average pointing time for a BGAN unit is 2 minutes, under a minute with an experienced user and a good signal. BGAN is being used in the world today for disaster response, telemedicine, business continuity, remote site monitoring (telemetry), military use, and recreational use.\n\nTerminal manufactures are Thrane & Thrane, Hughes Network Systems, and Addvalue. Terminal cost is between US$1800 and US$5000 varying based on class and capabilities of the various systems. Depending on terminal type users can connect their computers via USB, Bluetooth, WiFi, or Ethernet connection(s). This allows them to access the Internet, check e-mail, download files, or any other Internet activity they might do at a home or office. Many come equipped with a regular RJ11 Phone Jack for making PSTN calls, using an ordinary telephone handset, and many terminals have an ISDN connection to do ISDN phone calls. Some BGAN terminals have both so users can make either type of phone call. Users can also send faxes or SMS text messages. Most BGAN terminals can support a router or switch device so users can plug in multiple computers or even VOIP phones and set up a mobile office.\n\nThe BGAN service is accessible globally, excluding the poles.\n\nThere is more than one kind of BGAN service available from Inmarsat for BGAN terminals.\n\nThe Standard BGAN service from Inmarsat provides Internet, phone, SMS texting, Fax, ISDN and streaming services. It is designed for use with all BGAN terminals except the Hughes 9502 which uses the BGAN M2M service (below).\n\nThe Standard + Plus BGAN service introduced by Inmarsat in May 2017 provides unlimited Internet use for a low fixed monthly price using consumer grade routing. While not as high priority routing as Standard BGAN service, Standard + does have the same priority as the IsatHub Inmarsat network which is used worldwide. Standard + has a low monthly subscription that includes 5 Megabytes each month, and then bills at a fixed \"tier\" rate on if more than 5 Megabytes are used each month.\n\nBGAN M2M Service, launched in February 2012, is a low-bandwidth service for remote SCADA or M2M (machine to machine) equipment monitoring and control. BGAN M2M service is offered in 2, 5, 10 and 20 Megabyte monthly service plans. BGAN M2M service does not charge for overhead communication, and the smallest billing increment is 1 kilobyte, which is ideal for M2M communication (standard BGAN service has a 50 Kilobyte minimum transfer increment). BGAN M2M service is currently only available to the Hughes 9502 BGAN terminal.\n\nBGAN Link, launched in March 2012, is for fixed locations that require 5 to 30 Gigabytes of data transferred per month. In late 2013, Inmarsat introduced Unlimited BGAN Link \"GEO\" plans for certain countries/regions including Central and South America, Australia and lower Africa. Service fees with BGAN Link are far less than standard BGAN service, making this service more comparable to VSAT satellite dish services. One advantage of BGAN terminals are their low power usage (4 watts idle to 22 watts burst transmitting) which is much less than satellite dish systems that use 90 to 150 watts when idle or transmitting. BGAN Link service is only available with Class 1 BGAN terminals (the Hughes 9201 or the Explorer 700/710) and service terms are 3 and 12 months terms. Terminals may move 4 times per year with 30 days notice with a +$1,000 usd transfer cost, and must be at location for no less than 3 months. All standard BGAN services are available with BGAN Link (Internet, phone, SMS texting, FAX, Streaming). While BGAN Link service is global, approval by Inmarsat for activation is required.\n\nBGAN terminals are allowed to be used on the open ocean on a moving vessel. But because the vessel will be moving there is great chances to lose the signal and then the connection. Inmarsat informed DPs that the Core network is not blocking these connections.\n\nInmarsat has created the FleetBroadband service that uses the I4 satellites for maritime communication.\n\nStandard BGAN terminals cannot be used on moving aircraft due to doppler shift effects. An alternative service using more intelligent terminals to talk to the I4 satellites, named SwiftBroadband, has been developed for aircraft use.\n\nSky News correspondent Alex Crawford used BGAN equipment to provide live coverage, from a moving truck, of the news network's coverage of the liberation of Tripoli, Libya, in August 2011. This was done by the producer continuously readjusting the BGAN terminal to track the BGAN satellite. In-Motion BGAN satellite terminals are often used by media outlets for streaming video on the move. Another advantage to in-motion BGAN systems are for saving precious minutes when arriving at a live event. A media vehicle equipped with an in-motion system does not require pointing time since the in-motion BGAN terminal is already locked on satellite.\n\nSince late 2013 the service is available in an enhanced form known as HDR. HDR can exceed symmetric 700 kbit/s on select terminals and also support bonding for a total bandwidth exceeding 1 Mbit/s. As of 2016 the only terminal to support the full set of modes and bonding is the Cobham Explorer 710.\n\n\n"}

Adams left Emerald City in 1991 and was replaced by drummer Charlie Bushor in 1992. That same year, the band switched to a new name, The Why Store, the name of a former Muncie haberdashery.\n\nIn 1993, the band independently recorded \"Welcome to the Why Store\". One year later the band recorded \"Inside the Why Store\". Both albums were huge regional successes, and The Why Store began getting attention from record labels. At this time, touring keyboard player Jeff Pedersen was made an official member of the group, and in 1995 The Why Store signed to MCA's subsidiary Way Cool Music for their first major–label effort, a self–titled LP, which was released in 1996.\n\nThe song \"Lack of Water\", the band's most successful single, received steady airplay on Alternative Radio and reached #1 for two weeks on the Billboard AAA charts.

Although similar stories can be found in Boccaccio's \"Decameron\", a frequent source for Chaucer's tales, the story is a retelling of a common type of folk tale called \"the lover's gift regained\".\n\nThe tale tells of a merchant whose wife enjoys revelry and socializing, on which she spends money. A young monk, who is close friends with the merchant, comes to stay with them. After confessing that she does not love her husband, the wife asks the monk for one hundred franks to pay her debts. The monk, without her knowledge, borrows the money from the merchant to give to the wife, at which point she agrees with the monk:\n\nThe monk volunteers the information that has returned the loan back to the wife a few days after he had borrowed it, and then leaves town. When the merchant asks his wife about the money, she says it has been spent on clothing and blames the monk saying that she thought the money was in payment for him being such a long house guest. Instead of giving her husband the money back she says she will repay the debt in bed. As the wife is tallying her debt in bed the story ends on a bawdy pun that all should \"tally\" the rest of their lives.\n\nApart from a criticism of the clergy, a common theme of Chaucer's, the tale also connects money, business and sex. Similar tales often end with both the wife and husband being conned, but the addition of the wife, in turn, conning her husband seems to be Chaucer's own embellishment. \n\nThe use of the pronouns \"us\" and \"we\" when talking from a woman's perspective, along with the wife's success at the end of the tale, has led scholars to suggest that the tale was originally written for the Wife of Bath but as that character developed she was given a more fitting story and the Shipman took on this tale. In the line \"\"\"he moot us clothe, and he moot us array,\" (line 12) and others, \"us\" and \"we\" are used, in a way that could be interpreted as a married woman speaking for other wives. It is also possible The Shipman may simply be imitating a female voice, but the epilogue of the Man of Law's Tale in some manuscripts suggest it should be followed by the Shipman's tale rather than the Wife of Bath, whose tale usually follows. The changes give some insight into Chaucer's development of the tales and the connections between them.\n\nIn the BBC1 adaptation of \"The Shipman's Tale\" (renamed \"The Sea Captain's Tale\"), setting is changed to modern England and the protagonists are an Indian family. The monk's role is played by the merchant's business partner, who has come from India to set up a shop in England. The wife, beset by money problems, sleeps with this man, who learns of her previous affairs through the merchant. The business partner breaks up with the wife, and she, feeling jilted, smashes his shop. The merchant subsequently sends the other man back to India with a warning, and at the end he reaches across the bed to touch his wife's hand, a hint of possible reconciliation.\n\n\n"}

However, Samson does earn a $200 fee for doing a recital of his poetry to a woman's group that ends in disaster.\n\nOn Samson's behalf, but unknown to him, Rhoda seeks the help of psychiatrist Dr. West (Patrick O'Neal), who claims to be able to cure writer's block.\n\nRhoda gives Dr. West the $200 she collected for Samson's lecture to treat Samson for what she fears will become suicidal depression if he can't finish his poem. Dr. West reluctantly agrees to see him, and when Samson confronts the Doctor about the return of his money, West is fascinated by Shillitoe and persuades him to become a patient. In order for Samson to be away from the chaos of his life in the city that he might finish his poem, Dr. West arranges a stay for him in a sanitarium upstate.\n\nAnother doctor at the sanitarium, Dr. Menken (Clive Revill) is also interested in Samson, but for the purpose of experimenting on him with a new surgical technique to quell his violent temper. He persuades Rhoda to agree to the surgery. Dr. West and two other colleagues vehemently oppose such a procedure, as it is too close to a lobotomy to be safe.\n\nDr. West's wife, Lydia (Jean Seberg), is frustrated with their marriage. He is a popular TV guest for his pop psychiatric methods and views, and she sees very little of him. Eventually she runs into Samson at the sanitorium. Samson does not know she is married to Dr West but recalls her when she walked out of his women's club lecture. In his usual manner Samson immediately seduces her and the two have sex in a therapeutic bath. Dr. West, looking for Samson, secretly sees them in the tub.\n\nWhen it comes time for the clinic senior staff to vote on allowing the surgical technique to be performed on Samson, Dr. West, having seen Samson with his wife, changes his vote, enabling Dr. Menken to go ahead. Lydia finds out about the surgery and rushes to stop it, but arrives just after it has been completed.\n\nWhen Samson awakes from the surgery, at first his voice is so low and quiet he cannot be understood. As Dr. Menken leans in to listen, Samson throws a punch that lands the doctor on the floor. The operation has had no effect, and Samson returns to New York.\n\nRhoda quickly learns of his arrival, and rushes to rejoin him. Samson has finally been served with his subpoena, so he must pay his ex-wife or go to jail. Rhoda prevents him from pummeling the civil servant, until Lydia appears and pays him the amount owed.\n\nLydia informs Samson she is leaving Dr. West and hints that she would like to be with her new lover, Samson. Rhoda protests, as Samson invites her to come live with them both. Lydia, disgusted by the idea, becomes hysterical and rushes out, presumably never to speak to Samson again. Rhoda pleads with Samson as he goes charging off down the street, before informing him that she is pregnant. He accidentally punches her and the movie ends with him fighting off an angry mob of indignant spectators.\n\n\nJerome Hellman bought the film rights in May 1964.\n\n\n"}

The single was released in 2005 and was his first worldwide hit. It reached number one in several countries, including in the United Kingdom and Germany (where it stayed there for eight weeks), and Australia. It was also highly popular in France where it reached number two, and in the United States when it peaked at #4. An edited version was on Radio Disney and on \"Radio Disney Jams, Vol. 8\".\n\nWhen Akon was signed by Universal imprint SRC Records it was \"Lonely\" that had immediately caught the attention of SRC A&R Jerome Foster and convinced him of Akon's talents. On hearing the demo track he had said, \"This kid is official - this is a huge record.\" Despite offering the album's best option in terms of commercial breakthrough, SRC Records chose \"Locked Up\" over \"Lonely\" as the first single because SRC wanted to break Akon in the streets first and work towards a cross-over. According to Foster in an interview with HitQuarters, \"\"Locked Up\" is a street record. I thought that was the place for us to start to get a fan-base knowing that we had a record like \"Lonely\", which was more commercial, to follow it.\"\n\nThe song uses sped-up samples from Bobby Vinton's song \"Mr. Lonely\", providing a vocal sound similar to Alvin and the Chipmunks, a sound/technique made famous by producers such as RZA of Wu-Tang Clan, Newcleus and Kanye West. The song is written by Akon, Bobby Vinton, and Gene Allan. The lyrics are sung mainly by Akon as well as Bobby Vinton doing parts of the choruses.

It is the city's only main plant after the closure of Buick City. The Flint factory produces full-size GM pickup trucks.\n\nThe first factory location was in Flint, Michigan at the corner of Wilcox (now Chevrolet Avenue) and Kearsley Street, now known as \"Chevy Commons\", along the Flint River, across the street from Kettering University. \n\nThe plant, at G 3100 Vanslyke Road, was built in 1947. \n\nIn 1953 the first 300 Chevrolet Corvettes were hand built here before production was moved to St. Louis in 1954. \n\nThis factory also produced some of the second-generation Chevrolet Bel Airs for the North American market. Encouraged to do a collaboration by the nearby Emily Pottery Company, GM shared some of the colors used for the car, such as sky blue, and as of 2020, the pottery manufacturer still makes ceramics using those colors, albeit in limited quantities.\n\nProduction was split between Fisher Body and Chevrolet. The Fisher operations were halted on June 24, 1970, with the entire factory turned over to Chevrolet. \n\nFor much of the 1970s, Flint was home to the large Chevrolet K5 Blazer and Chevrolet Suburban, with pickup truck production moved to Pontiac Assembly Center in Pontiac, Michigan in May 1987.\n\nOn August 31, 1991, production of the large SUVs was moved to Janesville Assembly in Wisconsin. All laid-off workers returned to the plant on August 10, 1992 as production began. After the closure of Lordstown Van Assembly in 1993, Flint began to produce the former Lordstown Vans. The full-size van division was moved to Wentzville Assembly in Missouri in July 1996, but a new product, the GMT480, began at Flint the previous year. The large commercial General Motors C/K trucks began production in 1997.\n\nGM began production of GMT800 based Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra HD pickup trucks and chassis cabs at the plant in 2005. \n\nThe factory's previous product, the GMT900-based trucks, began in February 2007. The factory also produced GM medium-duty trucks, which were phased out in 2009 after GM discontinued that division. In 2010, GM produced the light duty crew cab pickups here. In May 2013, GM began production on the successor to the GMT 900 platform series, the GMT K2XX, for its next generation of light duty crew cab trucks for the 2014 model year.\n\nIn May 2016, General Motors invested $900 million for an addition to the Flint Truck Assembly complex. GM has spent an additional $2.8 billion on the complex since 2009.\n\nOn October 12, 2017, GM announced it would invest $79 million to bring a new trim shop to the complex.\n\nAs of 2020, Flint Truck Assembly currently produces the Chevrolet Silverado HD and GMC Sierra HD Regular and Crew Cab models.\n\n\n"}

The championship was for two-man tag teams only. While the NWA Board of Directors mandated that there would only be one NWA World Heavyweight Championship, they did not regulate the use of championships labeled \"NWA World Tag Team Championship\", allowing any member that so desired to create their own local version. As a result, as many as 13 different, regional versions were active in 1957, the highest number of active NWA World Tag Team Championships in existence at the same time.\n\nThe championship was introduced in 1953 when the promoters awarded the championship to Lord James Blears and Lord Athol Layton. The championship was promoted from 1953 until 1960 when Fred Kohler left the NWA to help form the American Wrestling Association (AWA) and thus the AWA World Tag Team Championship became the top tag team championship in the Chicago area. The Chicago promotion would later be bought by Dick Afflis, who merged it with his Indianapolis-based territory. The last NWA World Tag Team Championship was won by the Shires brothers, Roy and Ray, on April 9, 1960. The Volkoffs, Boris and Nicoli, held the championship four times, the record for the Chicago version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship.

The architect Horace Trumbauer (1868–1938) designed it for the coal baron Edward Julius Berwind (1848–1936), taking inspiration from the 18th century Château d'Asnières in Asnières-sur-Seine, France. C. H. Miller and E. W. Bowditch, working closely with Trumbauer, designed the gardens and landscape. The Preservation Society of Newport County purchased The Elms in 1962, and opened the house to the public. The Elms was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1996.\n\nThe Elms was constructed from 1899 to 1901 and cost approximately 1.5 million dollars to build. Like most Newport houses of the Gilded Age, the house was built with non-combustible materials: the house was built around a structural steel frame; the interior partitions, plaster over terra cotta blocks, sit on reinforced concrete floor slabs; the exterior walls are made of brick masonry and clad with limestone.\n\nOn the main floor, the principal axis leads from the eastern entrance porch, into an entrance hall with a grand staircase and a marble floor, then into the ballroom, and then out to the garden beyond. The wing to the south contains a dining room, breakfast room, and serving pantry (the kitchens were in the basement), while the wing to the north contains a drawing room, library, and conservatory. \n\nThe second floor contains bedrooms for the family and guests as well as a private sitting room. The third floor contains bedrooms for the indoor servants.\n\nIn keeping with the French architecture of the house, the grounds of The Elms, among the best in Newport, were designed in French eighteenth-century taste and include a sunken garden. The original American elms having succumbed to Dutch elm disease, the striking shade trees are now weeping beeches. \nTrumbauer built a large carriage house and stables on the edge of the property, with apartments above for the gardners and stable hands. in 1910, after the Berwind family began using automobiles, the carriage house and stables were replaced by a new garage, clad in limestone, long by deep, one of the largest private garages in America, with a central indoor track, and two gasoline tanks.\n\nWhen automobiles replaced horse-drawn carriages, the Berwind's head coachman became the chauffeur, but because he could not learn to back out of the garage, an automobile turntable had to be installed.\n\nThe Elms is considered to be a reinterpretation of the Château d'Asnières, an 18th century house in the town of Asnières-sur-Seine in Hauts-de-Seine, France. Nevertheless, it is not a replication; there are significant differences: the flanking sections of château d'Asnières are five bays wide, whereas and those at Trumbauer's house are four bays wide. The balustrade at The Elms is taller, but simpler in detail. Furthermore, the pediment on Trumbauer's garden facade is likely a variation of the pediment at Hôtel Porgès, 18 avenue Montaigne in Paris, built in 1892 by the architect Ernest Sanson. There is no pediment at Château d'Asnières.\n\nThe Berwind family began spending summers in Newport in the 1890s. By 1898, it was clear that their original property (a small traditional beach cottage) was too small for the grand parties the Berwinds were having, and so they had the place torn down. Berwind hired Horace Trumbauer to build a much larger house, better fitting his status. Like many of the grandest summer residents of Newport, Edward Berwind was \"new money\" (his parents were middle-class German immigrants); by 1900 his friends included Theodore Roosevelt and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany as well as many high-ranking government leaders from Europe and America. At this time Berwind was hailed as \"one of the 58 men who rule America\", making him one of Newport's most important summer residents.\n\nBerwind was interested in technology, and The Elms was one of the first houses in America to be wired for electricity with no form of backup system. The house also included one of the first electrical ice makers. It was one of the most sophisticated houses of the time. When The Elms opened in 1901 the Berwinds held a huge party.\n\nDuring the next 20 years, Berwind's wife, Sarah, would spend the summers there, the season being from the 4th of July to the end of August; Berwind would come out only on weekends, for his coal-mining interests kept him in New York during the week. Though the Berwinds had no children, their nephews and nieces would come out to visit on a regular basis.\n\nOn January 5, 1922, Mrs. Berwind died, and Edward asked his youngest sister Julia A. Berwind to move in and become the hostess of The Elms. In 1936, when he died, he willed the house to Julia, who, not being interested in technology, continued to run the house in the same way for the next twenty five years: washers and dryers were never installed at the Elms. Julia was well known in Newport. She would invite children from the nearby Fifth Ward (a working-class immigrant neighborhood) to the estate for milk and cookies. She had a love for cars and would drive around Newport every day in one of her luxury cars. This was somewhat shocking to the rest of Newport society, where it was considered unladylike for women to drive themselves. It was rumored that her social secretary would perform the \"white glove test\" to make sure there was no dust on the steering wheel before Julia got into the driver's seat.\n\nIn 1961 when Julia Berwind died, The Elms was one of the very last Newport cottages to be run in the fashion of the Gilded Age: forty servants were on staff, and Miss Berwind's social season remained at six weeks. Childless, Julia Berwind willed the estate to a nephew, who did not want it and fruitlessly tried to pass The Elms to someone else in the family. Finally the family auctioned off the contents of the estate and sold the property to a developer who wanted to tear it down. In 1962, just weeks before its date with the wrecking ball, The Elms was purchased by the Preservation Society of Newport County for $116,000. The price included the property along with adjacent guest houses. Since then, the house has been open to the public for tours. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1996.\n\nIn addition to a self-guided audio tour, The Elms offers a Servant Life Tour, which brings guests to the basement to view the coal-fired furnaces and the tunnel from which the coal is brought into the basement from a nearby street. The tour shows the lengths to which Mr. Berwind went to keep the servants out of view from guests on all floors of the mansion. Visitors on the Servant Life Tour view the laundry room, steamer trunk storage area, the giant circuit breaker box, ice-makers, galley, and wine cellar below the main floor, and climb the service staircase to the servants' quarters on the third floor. The tour then proceeds out on the level tiled roof and a small aluminum platform, with a view of the rear lawn, shade trees and gardens, and the vista of Newport harbor in the distance.\n\n\n\n"}

Third Man established its first physical location—a combination record store, performance venue, and headquarters for the label—in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2009. The label opened a Detroit branch location in 2015, which added a pressing plant (Third Man Pressing) in 2017.\n\nJack White founded Third Man Records in Detroit, Michigan, in 2001. White originally purchased the building to store his gear, and some plans to reissue the early White Stripes 45s. Third Man, which releases albums and singles primarily on vinyl record, established its first physical location in Nashville, Tennessee, on March 11, 2009. The Nashville location serves as a record store, label offices and live venue. It includes The Blue Room (a live performance venue and screening room for The Light and Sound Machine, a monthly film series co-hosted by The Belcourt Theater), a photo studio and darkroom, a storage facility for master recording tapes, and the label warehouse. The Blue Room is the only venue in the world to record live shows direct-to-acetate, producing a vinyl master in real time. To commemorate the opening of Third Man Records in Nashville, White debuted his new project, The Dead Weather, performing a short set for the 150 invited guests. The label's motto is \"Your Turntable's Not Dead.\"\n\nThe label's name incorporates several elements of personal significance to White. His fondness for the number three is well documented. It refers to Carol Reed's \"The Third Man\" starring Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles. White's old upholstering company was named Third Man Upholstery, and was also revolved around the colors of yellow and black. He stated in an interview with Conan O'Brien that the number three also comes from the minimum number of fastenings that are needed when upholstering. White also refers to himself as a woman's \"third man\" in the song \"Ball and Biscuit\" on The White Stripes' album \"Elephant\".\n\nAll six studio albums of The White Stripes appear with the Third Man logo. All three albums of The Raconteurs (\"Broken Boy Soldiers\", \"Consolers of the Lonely\" and \"Help Us Stranger\") also carry the label's logo. For The Raconteurs' tour of the United Kingdom in October 2006, 1,000 live albums were pressed and sold for each show, all of which display a Third Man logo. The Dead Weather, Jack White, The Black Belles, Karen Elson, and the Greenhornes are also core acts on the Third Man roster. Other artists who have released LP's on Third Man Records include Kelley Stoltz, Seasick Steve, and Pokey LaFarge. The label released and pressed a 7-inch vinyl of Conan O'Brien's 2010 comedy single \"And They Call Me Mad?\", which featured an interview of O'Brien by Jack White on its reverse.\n\nThe Third Man Records Vault is a \"rarity-excavating\" quarterly subscription service that began in September 2009 as a way to release special and otherwise unreleased content. Platinum members of the Vault receive a package containing limited-edition vinyl records and merchandise every three months. Generally each cycle's offerings have included a 12\" record, a 7\" record and a \"bonus item\" (this many include, a poster, book, pins, etc. ... ), although this format has been deviated from multiple times.\n\nThe label's headquarters is located in a less prosperous neighborhood, and is surrounded by a methadone clinic, a halfway house, and the city's main homeless shelter. White's presence, however, has raised the area's prominence, motivating the city and business owners to rezone the area with more creative ventures, including a members' club. White opposes the idea, calling the environment \"a solid neighborhood [where] everyone looks out for each other.\" The location is organized around five dedicated sections: the record store, a \"novelties lounge,\" the label's offices and distribution center, its recording studios, and its photo studio.\n\nThe Novelties Lounge, located within the record store, debuted on November 23, 2012. The space contains a collection of vintage novelty machines. \"Among the attractions in the new wing is a Scopitone machine—a video jukebox using 16mm film that had its greatest prominence in the 1960s. Third Man has loaded their Scopitone with 36 videos from the label catalog, and bill it as 'the world's ONLY Scopitone machine fully loaded with modern music.' Other highlights include a \"Wax-O-Matic\" machine,\" which makes bright red wax molds of White's Airline guitar, and a full-color photo booth.\" On April 20, 2013, in celebration of Jack White's role as Record Store Day Ambassador, The Third Man Recording Booth, \"a refurbished 1947 Voice-o-Graph machine that can record up to two minutes audio and press it onto 6-inch phonograph discs\" was introduced as an addition to the Novelties Lounge. This voice-o-graph was used in the creating of Apple's 2014 holiday ad as shown in the behind the scene video. In August 2017, Third Man celebrated the total solar eclipse happening event \"Occulting The Sunn,\" in Nashville.\n\nIn 2015, White partnered with Shinola—a lifestyle brand most known as a watch manufacturer—to open a retail location in Detroit. Third Man opened its first branch location at the Shinola building in Detroit's Cass Corridor by Record Store Day's Black Friday event on November 27, 2015. \n\nOn March 9, 2011, Third Man Records announced its newest creation, the Third Man Rolling Record Store. The store, a yellow step van outfitted with a sound system and Third Man Records inventory, was built by C Cook Enterprises in Erlanger, Kentucky. It made its first appearance in Austin, Texas, at SXSW 2011. Third Man has since brought the mobile store to concerts, festivals, and other events with anywhere from weeks to only a few hours notice.\n\nThird Man releases some music on compact disc and via electronic release on iTunes, but vinyl records are its primary format.\n\nIn addition to pressing titles on regular black vinyl, most releases have an exclusive and/or limited sister pressing on colored or multicolored vinyl. Beginning with TMR-003, a limited edition handmade batch of 100 tri-colored 7\" vinyl, in equal parts black, yellow, and white, were produced for exclusive distribution at Third Man's Nashville location. Beginning with TMR-009, an additional 50 tri-colored vinyl have been pressed for random distribution in Third Man mail orders. Certain single releases have been sold on tri-colored vinyl available at record stores in the artist's hometown instead of at the Nashville store. An additional 50 are still randomly distributed in mail orders.\n\nRecordings from live shows in the Blue Room (recorded either directly to analog reel-to-reel tape or direct-to-acetate) are made available in black and blue vinyl in varying quantities. These split-color records are available only to show attendees, and each LP is sealed with a concert-specific label on which the purchaser's name is written.\n\nThird Man is known for pushing the boundaries with vinyl record production, and with the help of United Record Pressing (their main partner in manufacturing records), their innovations include the following unique record pressings: Glow In The Dark Record, Triple-Decker Record (a 7\" within a 12\"), Texas-Sized Record (8\" and 13\" records), Metallized Record, Liquid-Filled Record, Scented Record, Rose Petal-Filled Record, Playable Etching Record, 3 RPM Record, Lightning Bolt Record, Bolt-A-Trope Record, and the Flex-Ray Record (a flexi disc made from an x-ray).\n\nTwo albums released by Third Man Records have received sales certification awards from the Recording Industry Association of America: \"White Blood Cells\" by The White Stripes was certified Platinum for sales of at least 1 million units and \"Blunderbuss\" by Jack White was certfied Gold for sales of at least 500,000 units. Additionally, the DVD release of the White Stripes documentary film \"Under Great White Northern Lights\" was certified Gold for longform video sales of at least 50,000 units.\n\n\n"}

Born in Edinburgh and educated at George Watson's College and the University of Edinburgh, he would spend three decades overseas and return to Britain in the 1960s. He was Governor of Hong Kong from 1958 – 1964, Governor of Singapore from 1955 – 1957 and as Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong from 1952 – 1955.\n\nSir Robert Brown Black served in the administration of Britain's colonies for more than 30 years. Entering the colonial service, Black was assigned to Trinidad, but the remainder of his postings were in Asia.\n\nDuring his posting in North Borneo Black was commissioned into the Intelligence Corps and involved in guerilla resistance against the Japanese. He was captured in 1942 and spent the remainder of World War II in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp.\n\nAfter the war ended, he returned to the colonial service and served in North Borneo and Hong Kong before moving on to Singapore as Governor (1955–57). Subsequently, he became Governor of Hong Kong from 1958 to 1964.\n\nDuring his governorship, Hong Kong became increasingly prosperous. At the same time, many tens of thousands of refugees were illegally crossing the border from China every year, driven in part by widespread famine in China during the years 1958-1961. Some were stopped and sent back, but almost all of the hundreds of thousands who reached Kowloon were allowed to stay. This influx placed an enormous burden on the colonial authorities, but the needs of the refugees were met by a programme of public housing construction and public health measures.\n\nRobert Black had been dealing with the patriotic Hong Kong Chinese in a heavy-handed way. On 18 April 1958, a raid was conducted on the library of the Pui Kiu Middle School (PKMS). The officer-in-charge of the Hong Kong Island Section of the Inspectorate of Education visited the school with five assistants. Nineteen books were confiscated and four were used as evidence of the ‘mismanagement of the school’ in a warning letter addressed to the school supervisor on 13 May. On the basis of these and other accusations, such as hiring of unregistered teachers and discussion of political issues in school meetings, To Pak-fui (杜伯奎), the principal of PKMS, was deported on 6 August, to Lo Wu.\n\nHong Kong experienced a prolonged drought of unanticipated severity during the last two years of his tenure, which led to a serious water shortage. Water rationing was imposed in May 1962 and continued through August 1964. From June 1963 until late May 1964 (when the arrival of Typhoon Viola ended the drought) the water supply was restricted to a single four-hour period every four days.\n\nBlack helped establish the Chinese University of Hong Kong by uniting several smaller institutions. He served as Chancellor of both the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the University of Hong Kong during his tenure as Governor of Hong Kong.\n\nHe was knighted (KCMG) in 1955 and promoted to GCMG in 1962.\n\nBlack returned to Britain in 1964. He was active with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the Royal Commonwealth Society, and served as chairman of the Clerical Medical and General Life Assurance Society in the 1970s. He died on 29 October 1999, having been predeceased some years earlier (in 1986) by his wife Anne. He was survived by their two daughters, Barbara and Kathryn.\n\n"}
{"id": "2015106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015106", "title": "Aelia Flaccilla", "text": "Aelia Flaccilla\n\nAelia Flavia Flaccilla (31 March 356 – 386), was a Roman empress and first wife of the Roman Emperor Theodosius I. She was of Hispanian Roman descent. During her marriage to Theodosius, she gave birth to two sons – future Emperors Arcadius and Honorius – and a daughter, Aelia Pulcheria. She was titled \"Augusta\", as her coinage shows.\n\nAccording to \"Laus Serenae\" (\"In Praise of Serena\"), a poem by Claudian, both Serena and Flaccilla were from Hispania.\n\nA passage of Themistius (Oratio XVI, \"De Saturnino\") has been interpreted as identifying Flavius Claudius Antonius, Praetorian prefect of Gaul from 376 to 377 and Roman consul in 382, to be her father. However the relation is considered doubtful. In 1967, John Robert Martindale, later one of several article writers in the Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, suggested that the passage actually identifies Antonius as the brother-in-law of Theodosius. However the passage is vague enough to allow Flavius Afranius Syagrius, co-consul of Antonius in 382, to be the brother-in-law in question.\n\nThe only kin clearly identified in primary sources was her nephew Nebridius, son of an unnamed sister. He married Salvina, a daughter of Gildo. Their marriage was mentioned by Jerome in his correspondence with Salvina. They had a son and a daughter.\n\nIn about 375–376, Flaccilla married Theodosius I, a son of Count Theodosius. At the time Theodosius had fallen out of favor with Valentinian I and had withdrawn to civilian life in Cauca, Gallaecia.\n\nTheir first son Arcadius was born prior to the elevation of his parents on the throne. Their second son Honorius was born on 9 September 384. Their daughter Pulcheria has been suggested to have been born prior to the elevation of her parents to the throne due to another passage of \"Laus Serenae\". She predeceased her parents as mentioned in the writings of Gregory of Nyssa.\n\nA younger Gratian – mentioned alongside the imperial children by Ambrose – has at times been suggested as a third son; however, Gregory of Nyssa reports the existence of only three imperial children and other sources do not mention Gratian. Gratian was possibly a relation of some sort but not an actual member of the Theodosian dynasty.\n\nValens, emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire was killed in the Battle of Adrianople (9 August 378). He was survived by his wife Albia Dominica and his daughters Anastasia and Carosa. He had however survived his only son, Valentinianus Galates. His nephew Gratian, Emperor of the Western Roman Empire, was his heir and assumed control of the Eastern Empire with his younger half-brother Valentinian II as his nominal co-ruler.\n\nOn 19 January, Gratian declared Theodosius, \"magister militum per Illyricum\", to be his new colleague in the Eastern Roman Empire. Theodosius seems to have been the senior officer of Roman origins available for promotion at the time. Merobaudes and Frigeridus, the two \"magistri militum in praesenti\" were probably not considered due to their Germanic origins. Several other equivalent positions remained vacant since the deaths of their last holders in Adrianople. At this point Flaccilla became the Empress consort.\n\nShe was a fervent supporter of the Nicene Creed. Sozomen reports her preventing a conference between Theodosius and Eunomius of Cyzicus who served as figurehead of Anomoeanism, the most radical sect of Arians, who believed that Jesus was in no way similar to the Father. Ambrose and Gregory of Nyssa praise her Christian virtue and comment on her role as \"a leader of justice\" and \"pillar of the Church\".\n\nTheodoret reports on her works of charity, personally tending to the disabled. He quotes her saying that \"\"To distribute money belongs to the imperial dignity, but I offer up for the imperial dignity itself personal service to the Giver.\"\" \n\nShe died early in 386. Her death is mentioned by (among others) Claudian, Zosimus, Philostorgius and Joannes Zonaras. According to the Chronicon Paschale, the \"Palatium Flaccillianum\" of Constantinople was named in her honor. A statue of her was placed within the Byzantine Senate.\n\nShe is commemorated as a saint by the Eastern Orthodox Church, her feast day being 14 September.\n\n"}

The series aired from May 21 to August 27, 2001 and ran for 13 episodes.\n\nThree young girls—Akari, Yuki, and Nozomi—meet at a concert and set out to follow in the footsteps of their idol, Reika, and become music stars. They enroll in the prestigious music school that produced Reika and are placed in the \"S class\" due to their potential.\n\nWhile \"Chance Pop Session\" could be characterized as a romantic comedy in the shōjo category, it does have some elements of tragedy.\n\nIn the US, ADV Films released 3 volumes of videos on VHS and DVD in 2003.\n\nThree girls—Akari, Yuki, and Nozomi—meet each other at the concert of their idol, Reika. Each speaks to one another briefly, then goes their separate ways. They all love to sing, and when they each find admission forms for a music school overseen by Reika's manager, they do not hesitate to sign up. Reika's manager, Akiba Kisaragi, meanwhile, has decided to create a special class, the S Class, within the school for any singers who catch her eye.\n\nAkari and Nozomi have no trouble signing up, and once there are nearly immediately accepted into the S Class, along with Jun Morimura. Akari and Nozomi recognize each other quickly and soon become close friends, but Jun keeps an aloof and superior attitude and students who were not selected for the S Class soon grow jealous. Yuki's hard-earned entrance money is stolen, and she joins a band of street musicians as a vocalist, soon becoming popular on the streets and online.\n\nAkari is one of the four members of Class S in the Chance Pop Session anime. She began her singing career as a member of church choir and she is the eldest of the three sisters. The \"Mizu\" in her name means water in English, which becomes significant later. She is voiced by Mayumi Iizuka in the Japanese and Kelli Cousins in the English dub.\nYuki is one of the four members of Class S in the Chance Pop Session anime and the middle sister of the trio. Her music career started as a street performer who was gaining a fan following before being recruited for Class S. The \"Ao\" in her name means blue in English, which becomes significant later. She is voiced by Atsuko Enomoto in the Japanese and Hilary Haag in the English dub.\nNozomi is one of the four members of Class S and the youngest sister in the Chance Pop Session anime. She began her singing career as a wealthy fan of Reika who wanted to attend the same school as she did. The \"Kai\" in her name means \"ocean\" in English, which becomes significant later. She is voiced by Maria Yamamoto in the Japanese and Monica Rial in the English dub.\nJun is a member of Class S in the Chance Pop Session anime. She believes that music and performing is all about competition and separates herself from the girls of R3, deciding to be a solo artist instead. She is voiced by Kana Ueda in the Japanese and Tiffany Grant in the English dub.\nReika was adopted by Kisaragi Akaba when she was around 10 years old. She had been abused by her show business mother, blaming Reika herself for being abused. When Kisaragi found her, they were both in need of each other. Kisaragi had lost many people close to her and was in a deep depression, whereas Reika needed a mother and Kisaragi's music helped her through her hard times. Once adopted by Kisaragi, Reika started singing and in no time she was a star like her adopted mother. When Kisaragi started her S-class and started looking for the next singing sensation though, Reika found herself a bit jealous. She is voiced by Mariko Kouda in the Japanese and Shelley Calene-Black in the English dub.\nKisaragi was a music superstar in her youth before becoming a singing coach. After being tragically separated from her three daughters, she adopted Reika and became her mentor. After deciding that Reika has learned all that she can from her, Kisaragi opens a music school and picks the best students for a special \"Class S\". She is voiced by Yuu Daiki in the Japanese and Christine Auten in the English dub.\nKaito is Akari's best friend and love interest. He encourages her to follow her dream of being a singer, and says he will race her to his own goal of becoming a teacher. He dies saving a child from being hit by a truck and becomes Akari's guardian angel. He is voiced by Takehito Koyasu in the Japanese and David Matranga in the English dub.\n"}

It has been designated a conservation area since 1969. It is situated on slightly elevated ground on the north bank of a loop of the River Esk. This ridge of ground, 20 to 25 metres above sea level, was used by the Romans as the location for a fort in the 2nd century AD.\n\nThe element \"Inver\", from the Gaelic \"inbhir\", refers to the confluence of the river Esk with the Firth of Forth.\n\nThe village was formerly in the Midlothian parish of Inveresk and developed separately from the burgh of Musselburgh.\n\nInveresk has a fine street of 17th- and 18th-century houses. Inveresk Lodge is now privately leased, but the adjacent Inveresk Lodge Garden belongs to the National Trust for Scotland, and its west facing gardens overlooking the river Esk are open to the public. This was formerly the mansion of James Wedderburn who had made his fortune as a slave-owning sugar plantation owner in Jamaica. When his son by one of his slaves, Robert Wedderburn, travelled to Inveresk to claim his kinship he was insultingly rejected by his father who gave him some small beer and a broken or bent sixpence. This experience turned Robert Wedderburn to radicalism.\n\nThe war memorial, south of the church, was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer in 1920.\n\nThe village is dominated by St. Michael's church that stands at its west end on the summit of a hill overlooking Musselburgh. Its graveyard/cemetery stretches westwards for almost 300m and is split into separate walled sections (marking its various stages of extension) which can be broadly bracketed as original (mainly 18th century), a late Victorian extension, an Edwardian/ early 20th century extension to the north, and a modern section to the far west.\n\nThe current church is by Robert Nisbet and dates to 1805 and has a stone spire of Wren-influence.\n\nThe graveyard has a number of interesting graves:-\n\n\n\n"}

The tournament followed the same format as in 2004 and 2005, with each team meeting the other two teams twice, and the top two teams at the end of the group stages proceeding to the final. Australia was to run out winners in a tight final, winning in golden point extra time with Kangaroos captain Darren Lockyer scoring a try in the 87th minute.\n\nCoach: Ricky Stuart (Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks)\n\nCoach: Brian Noble (Wigan Warriors)\n\nCoach: Brian McClennan (Auckland Lions)\n\nThe games were played at the following venues in Australia and New Zealand. The tournament final was played in Sydney.\n\nDuring the first minutes of the match Australian forward Willie Mason punched Stuart Fielden, breaking his nose and sparking a brawl, and later took Sean Long out after kicking, leading with an elbow which left Long's head bloodied and bandaged for the rest of the match. He was later charged for his punch on Fielden and had to face a Rugby League International Federation disciplinary committee the following Monday, where he was fined AUD$5000 and suspended for one game. After almost thirty minutes the Australians opened the scoring when, defending within their own ten-metre line, their scrum-half back Ben Hornby intercepted a pass and ran twenty metres before giving the ball on to winger Greg Inglis to run the remaining seventy to the line and score under the posts. Lockyer converted the try so it was 6 - 0 in favour of the Kangaroos. A few minutes later Irish winger Brian Carney left the field with a hamstring injury and was replaced by Lee Gilmour. Then Great Britain struck back with scrum-half-back Sean Long dummying his way through the defence thirty-five metres from the line then passing back inside to fullback Paul Wellens to score. Long then converted the try, so the scores were level at 6 all at the break.\n\nOn the other side of half-time, the Lions scored after about two minutes from close range when forward Jamie Peacock barged his way through the defence and over the line. The video referee gave the try 'benefit of the doubt' and Sean Long's kick didn't miss, so the score was 12 - 6 in favour of Great Britain. The Australians hit back with another long range try, the ball being moved out to Inglis on the left wing to make a break down the sideline before passing back inside to five-eighth Darren Lockyer to finish the run to the line and touch down behind the uprights. Lockyer then converted, levelling the score at 12 - 12. About ten minutes later the British struck back when Lee Gilmour hit a gap twenty metres out and ran through to dive over beneath the sticks. Sean Long converted so the Lions regained the lead at 18 - 12. With just over ten minutes remaining Great Britain got an opportunity to put themselves in front by more than a converted try when they were awarded a penalty, but Long's kick missed. Shortly after he got a chance to make amends with a drop goal but missed. However, with less than five minutes remaining he helped seal the match when he kicked a loose pass fifteen metres from his own goal-line downfield and chased after it, regathering and running just over the half-way line before passing it James Roby in support who couldn't outrun Nathan Hindmarsh. From the play-the-ball twenty metres away from Australia's goal-line, the British moved the ball through the hands out to the other side of the field to winger Gareth Raynor who dived over in the corner. Long's conversion attempt struck the post and missed, but he later kicked a field goal in the final minutes to make it a 23 - 12 victory, Great Britain's first in Australia since their 1992 tour.\n\nThis was the last match to be played against Australia by Great Britain before their permanent split into England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nEarly penalties for infringements in the ruck by the Kiwis, gave Australia an early two points from a Johnathan Thurston kick. The Kangaroos then mirrored this, conceding consecutive penalties that allowed Stacey Jones' goal a few minutes later to even the scores at 2 all. In the tenth minute Australia had the ball in the centre of the field and passed it out to Mark Gasnier who made a break down the right then passed to his winger Brent Tate to finish. Thurston's conversion was successful, so the home side led 8 - 2. Another penalty in the ruck in the twenty-first minute led to a minor scuffle and a goal from Thurston, extending the Kangaroos' lead to 10 - 2. Five minutes later New Zealand were ten metres into the Australians' half when Stacy Jones put a little chip kick over the heads of the Kangaroos for Brent Webb to run through and catch before drawing the defence and passing it on to Frank Pritchard who diver over untouched in the left corner. Jones missed the difficult conversion attempt, leaving the score 10 - 6 in favour of Australia. In the remaining ten minutes of play before half-time no more points were scored.\n\nAfter five minutes the Kiwis had made their way down to Australia's ten-metre line when they moved the ball through the hands out to the right where Nigel Vagana threw a short ball back inside for Iosia Soliola charging through to score. The scores were level at 10 - 10 and Stacy Jones' kick missed. A few minutes later Australia were given a penalty and Thurston kicked for goal, regaining his side's lead 12 - 10. In the sixty-ninth minute the Kiwis picked up a penalty in front of the posts and Jones kicked it this time, levelling the scores at 12 - 12. The Kangaroos then survived several raids on their try-line and two field goal attempts before a Cameron Smith 40-20 kick brought them up to New Zealand's end with two minutes remaining where Thurston missed a drop goal attempt as well. Jones had another shot in the final minute, and Australia nearly scored a miraculous fifty-metre try, but the match was destined for golden point extra time.\n\nThe first five-minute period of extra time featured a missed field goal attempt each from Lockyer, then Jones. The teams then changed ends and started again. After eighty-seven minutes of test football, Australia gained possession of the ball. Thurston then received it thirty-five metres from his own in-goal and dummied his way through the defensive line. After running fifty metres he passed back inside to Darren Lockyer in support who was ankle-tapped on his way to the try-line and stumbled over under the posts, giving Australia a 16-12 golden-point victory.\nAustralia's victory regained them the Tri-nations trophy which they had lost to New Zealand in the final of the 2005 series in England. Lockyer, who in 2006 captained Queensland to victory in the State of Origin, winning the Wally Lewis Medal for player of the series, captained the Brisbane Broncos to victory in the 2006 NRL Grand Final, then won his second Golden Boot Award for international player of the year, collected the trophy.\n\nThe New Zealand loss brought down the curtain on the test careers of captain Ruben Wiki, who retired as New Zealand's most capped international, as well as Stacey Jones and Nigel Vagana.\n\nDuring the series, Great Britain and New Zealand played additional matches to maintain their level of fitness.\n"}
{"id": "2015141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015141", "title": "Iolanta", "text": "Iolanta\n\nIolanta, Op. 69, () is a lyric opera in one act by Pyotr Tchaikovsky. It was the last opera he composed. The libretto was written by the composer's brother Modest Tchaikovsky, and is based on the Danish play \"\" (\"King René's Daughter\") by Henrik Hertz, a romanticised account of the life of Yolande de Bar. In the original Danish play, the spelling of the princess's name was \"Iolanthe\", later adopted for the otherwise unrelated Gilbert and Sullivan operetta of that name. The play was translated by Fyodor Miller and adapted by Vladimir Zotov. The opera received its premiere on 18 December 1892 in Saint Petersburg.\n\nComposed after the completion of \"The Queen of Spades\", Tchaikovsky worried that he had lost his creative inspiration after such a large project. He started \"Iolanta\" with the final duet in June 1891, and despite his worries, finished composition in September and orchestration in November. The public reception was quite favorable, though Tchaikovsky was disappointed and felt he was repeating himself, especially when compared to his earlier work, \"The Enchantress\".\n\nThe world premiere took place on 18 December (6 December O.S.) 1892 at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg. It was conducted by Eduard Nápravník and sets were designed by Mikhail Bocharov. The premiere of the opera shared a double bill with the composer's last ballet, \"The Nutcracker\". A 1997 two-act version of \"Iolanta\" is performed regularly at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, and in Belarus.\n\nIts first performance outside Russia was in Hamburg on 3 January 1893, with Gustav Mahler conducting. Mahler also conducted the Vienna premiere on 22 March 1900. In New York City it has been produced in 1997 and 2011 by Dicapo Opera. In 2015, \"Iolanta\" was performed for the first time at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, with Anna Netrebko in the title role.\n\nThere are only a few recordings of the opera, although Robert's aria has been recorded and performed in concerts frequently. A 1963 performance was filmed in Riga and released overseas in 1974.\n\nThe instrumentation requires the following forces:\n\n\"Time\": 15th century\n\n\"Place\": Mountains of southern France\n\nPrincess Iolanta has been blind from birth. No one has ever told her (nor does she know) that she is a princess. She lives in a beautiful enclosed garden on the king's estate, secluded from the world, in the care of Bertrand and Martha. Her attendants bring flowers and sing to her. She declares her sadness, and her vague sense that she is missing something important that other people can experience. Her father, King René insists that she not discover she is blind, or that her betrothed, Duke Robert, find out about this.\n\nAfter announcing the king's arrival, Alméric is warned by Bertrand not to speak of light with Iolanta or to reveal that Iolanta's father is the king. The king arrives with Ibn-Hakia, a famed Moorish physician who states that Iolanta can be cured, but the physical cure will only work if she is psychologically prepared by being made aware of her own blindness. Ibn-Hakia sings the monologue \"Two worlds\", explaining the interdependence of the mind and the body within the divinely ordained universe, which merges spirit and matter. The king refuses the treatment, fearing for Iolanta's happiness if the cure should fail after she has learned what she is missing.\n\nRobert arrives at the court with his friend Count Vaudémont. Robert tells Vaudémont that he wishes to avoid the marriage as he has fallen in love with Countess Matilde. He sings of his love in his aria \"Who can compare with my Mathilde\" (Кто может сравниться с Матильдой моей). Vaudémont finds the entrance to Iolanta's secret garden, ignoring the sign which threatens death to anyone who enters. He sees the sleeping Iolanta, without realising who she is and instantly falls in love. Robert, astounded by his friend's behavior, is convinced she is a sorceress who has bewitched Vaudémont. He tells him to leave, but Vaudémont is too entranced. Robert departs to bring troops to rescue him. Iolanta awakes and Vaudémont, who asks her to give him a red rose as a keepsake, realizes she is blind when she twice offers him a white one. She has no concept of light, vision or blindness. They fall in love, after he explains light and color to her.\n\nThe couple are discovered by the king. Vaudémont pledges his love, whether Iolanta is blind or not. Ibn-Hakia tells the king that as Iolanta is now aware of her blindness, the treatment might be a success. Iolanta who has no will to see, is unsure therefore whether she should agree to treatment or not. Ibn-Hakia points out that the lack of will proves that, without inner desire, change cannot take place.\n\nAfter Vaudémont admits seeing the warning sign at the garden entrance, the furious king threatens to execute him for revealing the truth to Iolanta. He tells Iolanta Vaudémont will die if the physician fails to restore her sight, in the hope that this will restore her will. Iolanta is horrified, and agrees to the treatment. After Ibn-Hakia leaves with Iolanta, the king explains to Vaudémont that he was feigning in order to motivate Iolanta. Robert returns with his troops. He admits to the king he has fallen in love with another, but is still willing to go ahead with the agreed marriage. The king cancels the wedding contract, and gives Iolanta to Vaudémont.

It also serves the surrounding areas (northern Aylesbury Vale, south Northamptonshire, north west Bedfordshire and north east Oxfordshire). It also provides tertiary education to Foundation Degree level. Its degree-level courses are validated by the Open University and the University of Bedfordshire.\n\nMilton Keynes College was created in 1982, when the further education colleges at Wolverton and Bletchley combined. Wolverton College's roots stem back to its association with neighbouring railway works, where it had a reputation for engineering training. The Bletchley College, founded in the early 70s, specialised in general education catering and art and design.\n\nThe main \"Chaffron Way\" Campus in Leadenhall (in Woughton, between Saxon Street and Grafton Street) opened in 1985.\n\nSince its inception in 1982 it is estimated that Milton Keynes College has taught over 200,000 students.\n\nIn January 2019, the College won a government contract to provide education in the majority of the long-term prisons in the country.\n\nAt present, Milton Keynes College has Campuses at Chaffron Way, in Bletchley and at the University Campus Milton Keynes in Central Milton Keynes. The college is the largest provider of further education and training in Milton Keynes, offering a varied mix of vocational courses to a diverse set of students. It also provides a range of part-time, work-based, community-based, and distance-learning courses. , Milton Keynes College has approximately 3000 full-time students.\n\nThe principal, Dr Mills, joined in 1990 as a lecturer in finance before becoming deputy principal.\n\nAt the front of the campus stands a sculpture 'Unity', designed by Dominic Warpole (an Art, Design and Media student). It is intended to represent the three college campuses and the staff, stakeholders and the community all coming together to support students.\n\nAugust 2008 saw a £3.5million extension plan on Milton Keynes College’s Chaffron Way campus. The extra saw the addition on a new learning resource centre and an IT training suite housing 70 PCs, along with a new library and a new reception area. A large outside court area to provide space for students to socialise in a secure environment was created.\n\nThe Chaffron Way Campus teaches Accounting; Business & Administration; Childcare; Computing; Construction (Bricklaying, Carpentry, Plumbing & Electrical Installation); Engineering; English for International Students; Foundation Learning; Health & Social Care; Performing Arts; Retail; Skills; Uniformed Public Services.\nBletchley Campus teaches Access; Art, Design & Media; Beauty & Holistic Therapy; Floristry, GCSEs & A Levels; Hairdressing; Hotel, Catering & Hospitality; Motor Vehicle & Motor Sport; Sports Science and Travel and Tourism.\nThe Innovation and Technology Centre (also known as the Engineering building) opened November 2011 on the College's Chaffron Way Campus following investment in modern equipment and facilities. It enables the teaching of advanced design, prototyping, manufacturing and inspection, automation and control, renewable energy and hydraulics, alongside existing classes in engineering and construction. The building itself was part of the former Frank Markham Community School (now demolished), and thus became part of the college.\n\nUntil summer 2012, the University Centre Milton Keynes was associated with the College. Since September 2012, the Centre ceased to be part of MK College and has become part of the University of Bedfordshire, re-branded as University Campus Milton Keynes\nThe college was graded a \"Good\" during the most recent inspection in May 2017 one of only 14 colleges to improve their Ofsted grade in the 2016/17 academic year.\n\nThe college had previously been graded as \"Requires Improvement\" in an Ofsted inspection carried out in February 2014, and again in June 2015\n\n\n"}

He was educated in his hometown public schools before graduating from Phillips Academy at Andover, Massachusetts. After studying at Yale and Notre Dame Universities, he entered Saint Bernard's Seminary in Rochester, New York. He was ordained Thursday, February 2, 1956 and enjoyed a full and varied priestly ministry for over 50 years. \n\nChamplin's first assignment was the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Syracuse, New York. He subsequently served as pastor at Holy Family in Fulton, New York and St. Joseph in Camillus, New York, and returned to the Cathedral where he retired after serving as Rector from 1995–2005. At the time of his death, he was the sacramental priest at Our Lady of Good Counsel in Warners, New York, and later in the Our Lady of Pompei school (Syracuse New York). In addition to his pastoral ministry, Champlin served as the Diocesan Director of Parish Life and Worship, and Associate Director in the Liturgy Secretariat for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington, DC. Champlin was an enthusiastic supporter of the institution of the ministry of Extraordinary Minister of Holy Communion.\n\nA prolific writer, he wrote 50 books with over 20 million copies of his publications in print. For many years, he authored a weekly column on liturgy and worship, appeared in a dozen videos, and made numerous television appearances. He also frequented local radio with inspirational insights, always concluding with, “You may have tried everything else, why not try God?”\n\nIn 1997, Champlin founded the Guardian Angel Society, a non-profit domestic trust effort to provide tuition assistance to children from economically challenged homes. The Society has raised close to $2 million and as of 2019 helped 300 youngsters reach their academic potential and have a better chance at life.\n\nChamplin traveled more than two million miles here and abroad, lecturing on liturgical and pastoral matters as well as conducting retreats for priests and parish missions.\n\nChamplin died January 17, 2008, at age 77 from a rare form of cancer. Having been diagnosed with Waldenstrom's, a bone marrow disease, in 2002, his health had been slowly deteriorating. Champlin had arranged to donate his body to Upstate Medical Center to help others through medical research to find cures for disease. Upon return of Champlin's cremains from Upstate Medical Center, they were interred on March 19, 2009 in the crypt of the Syracuse Cathedral.\n\n\n"}

It dates back to the thirteenth century when Trabzon was the capital of the Empire of Trebizond. It is located near the seashore and two miles west of the medieval town's limits. It is one of a few dozen Byzantine sites still extant in the area. It has been described as being \"regarded as one of the finest examples of Byzantine architecture.\"\n\nHagia Sophia was built in Trebizond during the reign of Manuel I between 1238 and 1263. The oldest graffiti carved in the apses of the church contain the dates 1291 and 1293. After Mehmed II conquered the city in 1461, the church was possibly converted into a mosque and its frescos covered in whitewash. Other scholars suggest it was not converted until 1584, being spared the initial transformation because it stood several kilometers outside the city walls. The monastery next door continued to be used by monks as late as 1701, when Tournefort found them still in residence. It is likely that the monks gradually abandoned a building that failed to protect them from harassment and predation, and the Turks assumed its use without needing to expel them.\n\nDuring World War I and for a brief period afterward, the city was occupied by the Russian military and used as a makeshift hospital and depot. Afterwards it was put back into use as a mosque, until 1964 when it was turned into a museum - which it remains to this day. Between 1958 and 1964 the surviving frescoes were uncovered and the church consolidated with the help of experts from the University of Edinburgh and the General Directorate of Foundations; one expert involved in the work estimated no more than one-sixth of the original decorations had survived. All that did survive, however, are thought to be original works done just after its construction, and are considered part of the Byzantine 'Palaiologic Renaissance'.\n\nThe Hagia Sophia church is an important example of late Byzantine architecture, being characterised by a high central dome and four large column arches supporting the weight of the dome and ceiling. Below the dome is an \"Opus sectile\" pavement of multicolored stones. The church was built with a cross-in-square plan, but with an exterior form that takes the shape of a cross thanks to prominent north and south porches. The structure is 22 metres long, 11.6 metres wide and 12.7 metres tall. The late 13th-century frescos, revealed during the University of Edinburgh restoration, illustrate New Testament themes. External stone figurative reliefs and other ornamenting is in keeping with local traditions found in Georgia. 24 metres to the west of the church is a tall bell tower, 40 metres high. It was built in 1427 and houses a small chapel on its second floor. The internal walls of the bell tower are covered in frescoes. It was also used as an observatory by local astronomers.\n\nIn 2012, the religious authorities (Diyanet) filed a lawsuit against the ministry of culture, claiming the ministry had been 'illegally occupying' the church for some decades. The Diyanet won the case, getting ownership of the building. On 5 July 2013, the former church was partially converted for a while into a mosque according to the local Vakif Direction of Trabzon, which is the owner of the estate. The reconstruction works were started, in which some frescoes were veiled and the floor covered by a carpet. The mufti of the Turkish province Trabzon said that “the works for opening the Hagia Sophia mosque in the city to practice prayers again are going on,” and that “during the prayer the mural paintings will be covered by curtains\". The local union of architects from Trabzon filed a lawsuit against the ministry of religious affairs' conversion plan. A local judge ruled the transformation of the former church to be illegal, and ordered it to be maintained as a museum.\n\nThe church figures prominently and has key significance for the author's spiritual development in Rose Macaulay's novel \"The Towers of Trebizond\".\n\n\n\n"}

It was influenced by the song \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\", both in the title of the song and through the song's opening refrain. (SongFacts writes, \"Rather than follow industry practice and simply pilfer the song, R.E.M. paid for the rights to use it. As part of the deal, R.E.M. were asked to do a cover of the original \"Lion Sleeps Tonight\".) The band used \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" as the B-side to this song. The song was released on R.E.M.'s 1992 album \"Automatic for the People\" and was later released as a single in 1993, reaching number one in Iceland, number 13 in Ireland, number 17 in the United Kingdom and number 29 in New Zealand.\n\nThe song was included on R.E.M.'s Warner Bros. \"best of\" album \"\" in 2003, one of four songs from \"Automatic for the People\" to make the compilation. In the liner notes, Peter Buck remarked: \"We included this song on \"Automatic\" in order to break the prevailing mood of the album. Given that lyrically the record dealt with mortality, the passage of time, suicide and family, we felt that a light spot was needed. In retrospect, the consensus among the band is that this might be a little too lightweight.\"\n\nDespite the song’s success, it was one of few R.E.M. songs never performed live by the group.\n\nThe lyrics are famously easy to mishear. A 2010 survey found that the chorus line \"Call me when you try to wake her\" was the most misheard lyric in the UK, beating second-place \"Purple Haze\", with the most common mishearing according to the survey being \"calling Jamaica\".\n\nA laugh by Michael Stipe can be heard at 2:33, immediately after he sings the closing line in the third verse \"or a reading from Dr. Seuss\" which refers to Dr. Seuss's rhymes. When trying to name-check Dr. Seuss, Stipe kept saying \"Zeus\" and laughs at his own inability to pronounce that correctly, which Mike Mills kept trying to get him to do. Stipe says he loved Dr. Seuss as a kid but always pronounced his name the wrong way.\n\nThe song's complete title is not featured in the lyrics, but there is the line \"the sidewinder sleeps in a coil\" as well as the later line \"the sidewinder sleeps on its back\". A sidewinder is a species of rattlesnake (\"Crotalus cerastes\"), and also an antique style of telephone, with a winding handle on the side. The lyrics frequently refer to making and avoiding phone calls. It is also an air pump such as the one used for inflatable mattresses. All three meanings seem to be referred to as wordplay, but this seems to be the primary meaning.\n\nMike Mills said: \"It's about somebody that doesn't have a place to stay. Part of it is also about what man can do that machines can't. The rest of it – I don't have any idea what it's about.\"\n\nMills also allegedly said, \"Half of the song is about somebody trying to get in touch with someone who can sleep on his floor. The other half - you're on your own.\"\n\nIn the liner notes for \"Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011\", Stipe said the song has one of his favorite lyrics: \"'Their world has flat backgrounds and little need to sleep but to dream.' Cartoon characters never just get sleepy, they always have to have a dream of some floaty kind.\"\n\nThe music video, released in February 1993, was directed by Kevin Kerslake, produced by Tina Silvey and Line Postmyr through production company Silvey & Co. and edited by Robert Duffy. Silvey and Postmyr produced many of Kerslake's music videos in the early 1990s (e.g. Ride's \"Vapour Trail\" and \"Leave Them All Behind\", Nirvana's \"In Bloom\", Red Hot Chili Peppers's \"Soul to Squeeze\" as well as Soundgarden's \"Motorvision\" home video). The video is often erroneously attributed to Peter Care—in the past even on R.E.M.HQ, this has since been rectified—who was never signed to Silvey & Co. and who directed through Propaganda Films' sister shop Satellite Films from 1992 to 2000.

It is located south of Hanoi and north of Hồ Chí Minh City.\n\nThe ancient Sa Huỳnh culture inhabited what is now Quảng Ngãi. Remains of it were found in Sa Huỳnh, Đức Phổ District. Within Champa, the region that is now Quảng Ngãi was less significant than Quảng Nam Province and Vijaya. There are only a few Cham remains in the province. The area became part of Vietnam along with Vijaya (Bình Định Province) in 1471. In the early 19th century the Long Wall of Quảng Ngãi was constructed in the province. It improved security among the Vietnamese and H're people and facilitated trade.\n\nQuảng Ngãi province was one of the first provinces in central Vietnam (together with Quảng Trị) to organize self-defense units in March 1945. The Ba Tơ Guerrilla Unit mobilized tens of thousands of peasants. It was known as a Việt Cộng stronghold during the Vietnam War and was the site of the purported Bình Hòa massacre (1966) and the My Lai Massacre (1968), as well as Operations Malheur I and Malheur II and Operation Quyet Thang 202. Quảng Ngãi was known to be a Viet Cong stronghold during the war, and the site of numerous ambushes and attacks against ARVN and American troops, particularly at night. The province produced famous war literature on both sides of the conflict: The now-famous wartime diary of Viet Cong medic Đặng Thùy Trâm was written here, and from an American perspective, Quảng Ngãi Province is the major setting of Tim O'Brien's \"The Things They Carried\".\n\nQuảng Ngãi's topography is dominated by a large plain along the coast and in the center of the province and by mountains and hills in the west and along its borders with Quảng Nam and Bình Định provinces. Lowlands extend further inland along Trà Khúc River. The province's highest peak is at 1630m in the west of the province near the border to Quảng Nam. The coastline is relatively straight in most of the south and central part of the province (unusual for the South Central Coast), but features several capes north of Quảng Ngãi City. The province's largest river is the Trà Khúc. Other important rivers are the Trà Bồng in the north and the Ve River in the south of the province. The Lý Sơn islands belong to Quảng Ngãi. \n\nThe province had a population of 1,219,200 in 2009. Around 40% is concentrated in Quảng Ngãi City and the two districts just north and south of it (Sơn Tịnh and Tư Nghĩa), where population density ranges from over 500 to 3600/km). Population density in most of coastal Quảng Ngãi is around 400/km. The five western districts have population densities of less than 100/km, three of them (Tây Trà, Sơn Tây, and Ba Tơ) even less than 50/km. Quảng Ngãi is the least urbanized province of the South Central Coast, with only 14.4% of the population living in cities and towns. The population grew by an annual average of 1% between 2000 and 2007, while the growth of the urban population was 3.9% on average, one of the highest rates in the region.\n\nThe coastal lowlands are mostly ethnically homogeneous, with almost the entire population (>99%) made up of Kinh people. There are large Hrê communities in the southwest of the province. They made up the majority of the population in the districts of Ba Tơ, Sơn Hà (which then also included Sơn Tây), and Minh Long as of 1996. A slight majority in Trà Bồng District (which then also included the Tây Trà District) were Co people. There is also a small minority of Xơ Đăng in Sơn Hà District.\n\nQuảng Ngãi is subdivided into 14 district-level sub-divisions:\n\n\n\n\nThey are further subdivided into nine commune-level towns (or townlets), 166 communes, and nine wards.\n\nQuảng Ngãi's GDP per capita was 7.82 million VND in 2007, making it the second poorest province in the South Central Coast (after Ninh Thuận), due to weaknesses in all major sectors of the economy (agriculture, industry, services). However, Quảng Ngãi's economy has been booming since then, due to a spectacular increase in industrial GDP from the Dung Quat Economic Zone. It grew by 21% in 2009, increasing GDP per capita to 15.2 million VND, higher than that of its neighbours, Quảng Nam and Bình Định provinces. Exports increased from 31 million US$ in 2005 to 182 million in 2009.\n\nThe number of employed people increased from 571,400 in 2000 to 704,700, despite a significant decline agricultural and fishing employment. The booming industrial sector created 63,200 jobs in the period and employs 99,200 as of 2007. Despite lacking behind the industrial sector in terms of value-added, the service sector employed 180,500 people in 2007 compared to 57,900 in 2000.\n\nDespite its large agricultural area, Quảng Ngãi's agricultural GDP is low compared to other provinces in the region. Rice cultivation takes up the largest area, concentrated around Quảng Ngãi City. 381,200t of rice were harvested in 2007. Other important crops include sugar-cane, peanuts, and coconuts. There is a large number of cattle in the province (287,800 in 2007), mostly in the northwest and southwest.\nQuảng Ngãi's fishing output as share of total national output is larger than its population share . Lý Sơn island plays an important role as an offshore fishing center. It contributed almost one fourth to the total of 126,000 tonnes of fish caught in 2012. However, in contrast to the rest of the region, there is a lack of rich fishing grounds off the coast of Quảng Ngãi province.\n\nQuảng Ngãi City is a secondary industrial center of the South Central Coast with processing of agricultural products and production of some paper and machinery. Other products include beer (38.3 million litres in 2007), textiles (5,577 pieces), bricks (303 million), chemical fertilizer (24kt), and hand farming tools (352,000 pieces). Furniture is produced in Quảng Ngãi as a major export product, accounting for 11.475 million US$ in 2007.\n\nIndustrial GDP has more than tripled between 2000 and 2007, growing by an average yearly rate of 18.64%. This was the second highest growth rate in the South Central Coast after Bình Thuận Province. Industry has grown even faster since then, due in large part to the Dung Quat Economic Zone. The Dung Quất Refinery, Vietnam's first oil refinery, started production in February 2009. In the same year, industrial gross output increased by 144.7% and the share of industry in the province's GDP surged from 36.2% in 2008 to 46.3% in 2009. This share is higher than that of other provinces in the region and even slightly higher than that of Đà Nẵng. The province's prospects for industry may also be changing outside Dung Quat Economic Zone. Vinatex bought Đại Cát Tường, a formerly bankrupt textile manufacturer, in 2011 and plans to expand its production in Quảng Ngãi significantly.\n\nQuảng Ngãi's industry was dominated by the state sector (mostly centrally managed companies) until 2005, after which most of the state industry was (officially) privatized. The state sector's share decreased from 2/3 in 2000 to around 1/8 in 2007, while there was also a restructuring within the state sector from central state to locally managed state enterprises.\n\nNational Route 1A and the North–South Railway run through the province. The main railway station is the Quảng Ngãi Railway Station. National Road 24 connects Quảng Ngãi to Kon Tum in the Central Highlands. It has its starting point at Thach Tru on National Route 1A 28 km south of Quảng Ngãi City and passes through Ba Tơ District. The nearest airport is Chu Lai International Airport, just north of Quảng Ngãi province. The province has a major port in the Dung Quat Economic Zone, namely Dung Quat Port, in the north of the province. Sa Ky is a local port north of Quảng Ngãi City. It serves as a fishing and small cargo port and has regular ferry connections to Lý Sơn island.\n\nThere is a hydroelectric station on Trà Khúc River in the center of the province. It is located near the border of Sơn Hà District with Tư Nghĩa District and Sơn Tịnh District. As of 2007, 401 million kwh were generated in the province.\n\nLong Wall of Quảng Ngãi was discovered in 2005.\n\nIn April 2012, there have been multiple reports of an outbreak of an unknown fatal disease in the area around Ba Tơ.

They met at the combined ATP/WTA event in Rosmalen that year. One year later in 2014 at the same tournament in Rosmalen, the two got engaged on June 16, after Emmrich had proposed to Krajicek on centre court after her first-round win against Jana Čepelová, and got married in July 2015. However, they separated in mid-2017 and announced their divorce via Twitter in May 2018.\n\nIn 2002, the 13-year-old Krajicek was included in the Dutch team for the Cesky Telecom World Junior Tennis final. She was the number-one-ranked junior player in Europe at the time. Krajicek led her country to victory over Poland in the final, winning both her singles and doubles matches en route to a 3–0 win for the Netherlands.\n\nKrajicek won the first Grade-A tournament of 2003 (the Yucatán Cup in Mexico), making it her fourth victory in the seven tournaments she had entered. Her record stood at 33–3. Krajicek won her second Grade-A tournament at the Italian Open taking her to the No. 2 ranking in the world. At the French Open Krajicek lost in the semifinals to Vera Douchevina and reached the final of the doubles with Kateřina Böhmová, losing to Marta Fraga Pérez & Adriana González Peñas in straight sets. Prior to Wimbledon, Krajieck was expected to be one of the main challengers but she lost a three set match 6–8 in the third to Anna Chakvetadze, which ended at 8.50 pm. She got to her second successive Grand Slam junior doubles final with Böhmová, but they lost to scratch pairing Alisa Kleybanova & Sania Mirza in three sets. At the US Open, Krajicek was the favourite, alongside recent Wimbledon winner Kirsten Flipkens. The draw went to form and they met in the final, with Flipkens winning 6–3, 7–5. Krajicek was in tears afterwards and said that she was happy to reach the final but blamed the loss on tiredness and inferior conditioning. In September, Krajicek was named in the Dutch Junior Fed Cup team, a competition the Netherlands had not won since 1990. Despite a persistent nosebleed which threatened her to retire in the semifinals Krajicek was undefeated throughout the tournament as the top-seeded Dutch team won, beating Canada 2–1 in the final. She needed a win in the final event of the year to end 2003 the No. 1 junior in the world but lost in the second round of the Orange Bowl International to Neha Uberoi. She ended the year ranked No. 2 behind Flipkens.\n\nKrajicek had a knee injury at the beginning of 2004 and did not play until late February. At the French Open Krajicek & Böhmová finally won their first Grand Slam Junior Doubles title, beating Irina Kotkina & Yaroslava Shvedova 6–3, 6–2. Krajicek had lost in the quarterfinals of the singles to Timea Bacsinszky 6–8 in the third set. At Wimbledon, Krajicek reached the semifinals of the singles and doubles, losing to eventual champion Kateryna Bondarenko in the singles and alongside new doubles partner Shahar Pe'er falling to Victoria Azarenka & Olga Govortsova. It was at this point that Krajicek started playing ITF tournaments on a regular basis.\n\nAfter winning Satellite tournaments in Brussels in July and Koksijde in August, Krajicek built on these successes by finally winning her maiden singles Junior Grand Slam at the US Open. She beat Jessica Kirkland 6–1, 6–1 to go one step further than the previous year and become the first Dutch winner of the event in ten years (when Sjeng Schalken won the boys' in 1994). In October, Krajicek qualified for her first WTA Tour event in Luxembourg but she lost to No. 8 seed Shinobu Asagoe in the first round proper. She won another ITF tournament in Stockholm then beat her first top-100 player (Slovak Ľudmila Cervanová) as well as her Wimbledon conqueror Bondarenko en route to the semifinals of the tournament in Poitiers. She followed that up with a win in Bergamo (a tournament) and ended the year ranked No. 429 in the world in the WTA rankings and was the 2004 ITF Junior World Champion, ending the year No. 1 in the world for juniors. She had a 41–6 record in singles and was the first Dutch player to become junior world champion. Her record in seniors was 26–4, winning 26 of her last 28 matches, capturing four ITF titles in the year. Her record on hard courts was 16–2, clay was 10–1, and she lost her only match on grass.\n\nAt the age of 16 Krajicek qualified for her first Grand Slam event, the Australian Open. She beat three opponents ranked higher than her to qualify, then beat top-100 player Stéphanie Foretz in straight sets before losing in the second round to No. 12 seed Patty Schnyder. In February she won her first ITF tournament in Urtijëi, beating No. 51 in the world Martina Suchá in the last 16. Three months later, Krajicek reached her first doubles final on the WTA Tour, the Estoril Open partnering Henrieta Nagyová.\n\nNow ranked No. 114, she qualified for her second successive Grand Slam (the French Open) without dropping a set but unfortunately drew the No. 20 seed Daniela Hantuchová in the first round and lost to the Slovak 3–6, 1–6. A consolation was that her performance in qualifying had made her a top-100 player for the first time, ranked No. 99. After the French Open, Krajicek received three wild cards into Wimbledon. She intended to play in both the women's doubles and mixed doubles (together with her brother Richard). However, she was injured during the tour event in Rosmalen just a week before the start of Wimbledon, and had to withdraw.\n\nKrajicek returned to play in October by qualifying for the Tier II event in Luxembourg, but a week later, Krajicek won her first WTA event by winning the Tashkent Open. She beat Akgul Amanmuradova in the final. It was the first WTA tournament win for a Dutch female in eight years, after Brenda Schultz-McCarthy won the Bell Challenge in Quebec. Three weeks after that in Hasselt, she beat Anna Chakvetadze, Lucie Šafářová and the No. 13 in the world Nathalie Dechy on her way to the semifinals where she lost to Francesca Schiavone.\n\nShe ended the year ranked No. 58 in the world with a 30–10 playing record. She went 17–5 on hard courts, 6–4 on clay, 2–1 on grass and 5–0 on carpet.\n\nShe started the year by qualifying for the Hopman Cup tournament in Perth with Peter Wessels where the duo went all the way to the final to be beaten in a very close mixed doubles by the American team of Taylor Dent and Lisa Raymond. She won three out of her five singles matches (def. Lisa Raymond, Gisela Dulko and Anna-Lena Grönefeld; lost to Samantha Stosur and Peng Shuai). In mixed doubles, they had a 3–2 record (def. Reid/Stosur, Peng/Sun, Grönefeld/Kiefer; lost to Raymond/Dent, Dulko/Gaudio).\n\nA week later, Krajicek won her second WTA title in Hobart only dropping one set en route to the final, where she beat her practice partner Iveta Benešová 6–2, 6–1. This win put her inside the top 50 to a career-high ranking of No. 43 entering the Australian Open. At the Australian Open Krajicek reached the third round for the first time ever in a Grand Slam tournament. In the first round she beat Kristina Brandi and in the second she defeated 32nd seed Sania Mirza of India. However, she retired from her third-round match with Amélie Mauresmo, after suffering from heat exhaustion.\n\nThe clay-court season was not a successful one, despite a semifinal appearance at the İstanbul Cup where she lost to Anastasia Myskina in straight sets. This was the only real highlight on clay for Krajicek in 2006 as she lost in the first round of the French Open in straight sets to No. 7 seed Patty Schnyder. This led her to drop out of the top 50, but that was only briefly as in the warm up for Wimbledon she won her third career title (and second of the year) in 's-Hertogenbosch (her brother Richard was one of the tournament organisers). In the semifinal she beat a top-10 player for the first time in what she described as the best match of her career, overcoming No. 1 seed (and No. 8 in the world) Elena Dementieva in three sets. She beat Dinara Safina in the final, but could not continue her form into Wimbledon though, losing in the first round to Australian doubles expert Samantha Stosur.\n\nPost-Wimbledon Krajicek won two successive Tier IV doubles tournaments on clay with Janette Husárová in Palermo and Budapest, the latter where she also got to the semifinals in singles competition. Thereafter the hard-court season was not a productive one for Krajicek, losing in the first round of four successive tournaments, including the US Open where she lost 3–6, 0–6 to the eventual winner Maria Sharapova.\n\nKrajicek ended the year ranked No. 35 in the world, she had a 27–18 record, 14–9 on hard courts, 8–7 on clay, 5–1 on grass and 0–1 on carpet. She was 1–5 against top-10 opponents.\n\nKrajicek's 2007 season did not start as strongly as her 2006 one did as she lost 6–3, 1–6, 0–6 to Séverine Brémond in the first round of the Moorilla Hobart International, where she was the defending champion. She was then defeated in straight sets by Luxembourg's Anne Kremer in the first round at the Australian Open. The inability to defend the previous year's points dropped her ranking dramatically as she entered Paris ranked No. 70 in the world. After being dumped out of the first round in Paris in straight sets by Dinara Safina, Krajicek proceeded to lose in the second round of four successive tournaments. Her best result on clay prior to the French Open was a quarterfinal run in a Tier I tournament in Charleston. Krajicek beat both No. 1 seed Nicole Vaidišová and Sybille Bammer in three sets before losing to Vera Zvonareva.\n\nAt the French Open she made the third round, beating local favorite and No. 31 seed Séverine Brémond followed by Shenay Perry before losing to No. 8 seed Serena Williams. As the No. 31 seed at Wimbledon (but ranked outside the top 40 for not defending points in 's-Hertogenbosch), her skills on the grass shone through as she defeated Tzipora Obziler, British wildcard Katie O'Brien, No. 8 seed (and No. 7 in the world) Anna Chakvetadze and Laura Granville en route to her very first quarterfinal showing at a Grand Slam. In her quarterfinal match she was defeated by No. 18 seed and eventual finalist Marion Bartoli in a rain-affected three set match.\n\nFollowing Wimbledon, though top-seeded she lost in the first round of Palermo, losing 2–6, 4–6 to 111th ranked Czech Eva Birnerová in her final tournament prior to the American hard court season. Krajicek lost in the second round in San Diego to former No. 1 Martina Hingis, the third round in L.A. to Maria Sharapova (a match where the wind conditions were so poor one end was virtually unplayable) and the first round in Toronto to Shahar Pe'er. At the US Open Krajicek fell in the second round to Ágnes Szávay in two sets.\n\nOn the European indoor-circuit Krajicek fared a little better, going out in the first round in three of her final five tournaments and only winning one match in Moscow. Her only good run came in Stuttgart where, due to the heavily packed field, she had to qualify and won four matches in a row before succumbing to Nadia Petrova 1–6, 3–6 in the last 16.\n\nHer record in 2007 was 24–26 (her first season on tour with a losing record), with 11–12 on hard courts, 7–8 on clay, 5–3 on grass and 1–3 on carpet. Her record against top 10 players was 2–5. She finished 34th in the \"Race to the Sony Ericsson Championships Singles Standings.\"\n\nKrajicek struggled early in 2008. After bombing out in the first round at the ASB Classic, she lost to Akiko Morigami during the first round of the 2008 Australian Open. Following a break of over a month, she lost her first match at the Pacific Life Open to the Russian Galina Voskoboeva. Then at the Sony Ericsson Open she lost first up Marina Erakovic in three sets. She then lost to Alizé Cornet at the Family Circle Cup.\nReturning to Europe, she lost four straight tournaments without winning a set. These were to Akgul Amanmuradova at the ECM Prague Open, Sybille Bammer at the Qatar Telecom German Open, Samantha Stosur at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia and then Sanda Mamić at the French Open\n\nHer form turned around at Birmingham where she defeated Tatiana Poutchek 6–2, 6–1 for her first win of the year. However, she lost to eventual finalist Yanina Wickmayer. At her home tournament in 's-Hertogenbosch, she defeated Japanese veteran Ai Sugiyama in a tough battle 6–1, 5–7, 7–6. In the second round she then defeated Sania Mirza 6–2, 6–2. However, she lost the quarterfinal against Tamarine Tanasugarn.\n\nAt the end of the year her singles ranking was 219. Her record for the year was 8–16.\n\nKrajicek mainly played ITF tournaments early in the year, with limited success. In particular, she missed the Australian Open for the first time since 2004. However, she did play some WTA tournaments, notably the Cellular South Cup, where after qualifying, she made it to the quarterfinals, losing to first seed Caroline Wozniacki. Furthermore, Krajicek made the doubles final of that tournament, playing with Yuliana Fedak, eventually losing to Wozniacki and Victoria Azarenka.\n\nIn June, she won an ITF event in Boston, defeating Rebecca Marino in the final. Throughout the year, Krajicek never failed to make at least the semifinals in any doubles tournament that she competed in. She won two, the first in Torhout with Yanina Wickmayer in April, and then in November with Sofia Arvidsson in Bratislava.\n\nThe only Grand Slam tournament that Krajicek entered qualifying for in 2009 was the French Open, losing her first match to Simona Halep.\n\nAt the end of the year her ranking in singles was 129. Her record for the year was 4–7.\n\nPreparing for the Australian Open, she participated in Brisbane and Hobart both losing in the qualifications. Because of her ranking Krajicek had to play the qualifications for the Australian Grand Slam, falling in the third round to Angelique Kerber in three sets. She also competed in the doubles main event with Dominika Cibulková, but lost in the first round.\n\nHer next tournament was the Cellular South Cup in Memphis. She lost in the second round to Petra Kvitová. She won the doubles titles with her partner Vania King.\n\nShe played in the qualification rounds for Monterrey, Indian Wells, Miami and Ponte Vedra Beach.

Later in Charleston she reached the second round.\n\nBefore going to Europe for the two Grand Slams, she competed on the ITF circuit in the U.S. Reaching the second round in Dothan, winning Charlottesville and falling in the quarterfinals in Indian Harbour Beach. Charlottesville would be the only singles title Krajicek would win in 2010.\n\nHer season end ranking in singles was 141.\n\nIn the Australian Open she participated in the qualification tournament, losing in the first round to the No. 156 player Sabine Lisicki. In the doubles, she reached the second round with partner Petra Kvitová.\n\nFor the first time since 2007, Krajicek competed for the Netherlands in the Fed Cup. Playing in Group I of the European/African zone against Hungary, Romania and Latvia, she won all her singles matches. Winning most notably from Monica Niculescu, ranked 68 on the WTA Tour. After being undefeated in the group round the Netherlands faced Switzerland in the semifinal. Krajicek lost both her single and double match, partnered with Arantxa Rus, thus eliminating the Netherlands from the competition.\n\nLike previous years she competed at the Cellular South Cup winning the first round from Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová with 6–1, 6–3.

In the doubles, she lost in the first round.\n\nAt the US Open, Krajicek came through to qualifying to reach her first Grand Slam main-draw since Wimbledon 2008, facing Eleni Daniilidou in the first round. She won 3–6, 7–6, 6–1 to progress to the second round, where she faced title favourite Serena Williams to whom she lost easily, 0–6, 1–6.\n\nShe then played at the Bell Challenge in Québec City.

In doubles, she played the main draw with her partner Alexandra Dulgheru. They faced wildcards Sofia Arvidsson and Jelena Dokic in the first round and lost 1–6, 3–6.\n\nAt the Australian Open Krajicek gained direct entry into the main draw for the first time since 2008. She played Kristina Barrois in the first round and came through with a two-sets victory after saving five setpoints in the tiebreak. She was set to play her second-round match against former world No. 1, Ana Ivanovic. However, she was suffering from nerves as the match was played on the Hisense Arena and Krajicek lost 2–6, 3–6.\n\nIn the last week of January, Krajicek played the Fed Cup together with fellow Dutch players Arantxa Rus, Kiki Bertens and Bibiane Schoofs. She failed to convert a matchpoint against Israeli Shahar Pe'er and lost 7–5, 6–7, 1–6. Also Elena Baltacha and Michelle Larcher de Brito proved too strong, Krajicek losing 3–6, 3–6 and 1–6, 2–6 respectively.\n\nIn February and March, Krajicek made a trip along tournaments in North America. At her usual stop at the indoor WTA tournament of Memphis, she defeated Elena Baltacha 6–2, 6–1, firing 15 aces.

{"id": "2015211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015211", "title": "Nelson rules", "text": "Nelson rules\n\nNelson rules are a method in process control of determining if some measured variable is out of control (unpredictable versus consistent). Rules, for detecting \"out-of-control\" or non-random conditions were first postulated by Walter A. Shewhart in the 1920s. The Nelson rules were first published in the October 1984 issue of the \"Journal of Quality Technology\" in an article by Lloyd S Nelson.\n\nThe rules are applied to a control chart on which the magnitude of some variable is plotted against time. The rules are based on the mean value and the standard deviation of the samples.\n\nThe above eight rules apply to a chart of a variable value.\n\nA second chart, the moving range chart, can also be used but only with rules 1, 2, 3 and 4. Such a chart plots a graph of the maximum value - minimum value of N adjacent points against the time sample of the range.\n\nAn example moving range: if N = 3 and values are 1, 3, 5, 3, 3, 2, 4, 5 then the sets of adjacent points are (1,3,5) (3,5,3) (5,3,3) (3,3,2) (3,2,4) (2,4,5) resulting in moving range values of (5-1) (5-3) (5-3) (3-2) (4-2) (5-2) = 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3.\n\nApplying these rules indicates when a potential \"out of control\" situation has arisen. However, there will always be some false alerts and the more rules applied the more will occur. For some processes, it may be beneficial to omit one or more rules. Equally there may be some missing alerts where some specific \"out of control\" situation is not detected. Empirically, the detection accuracy is good.\n\n\n"}

When the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) was founded in 1948, its board of directors decided to allow any NWA member, referred to as an NWA territory, to use an NWA World Tag Team Championship within their region, essentially making it a regional championship despite the \"World\" label applied to it. Since the NWA World Tag Team Championships were professional wrestling championships, they were not won or lost in legitimate competitive matches but decided by booker(s) of a wrestling promotion instead.\n\nThe Georgia version of the NWA World Tag Team championship existed for 16 years. The fact that the board of directors did not put any limits on who could bill a championship as the NWA World Tag Team Championship led to at least 13 different championships of that name being used across the United States simultaneously at one point in 1957. Enrique Torres and Art Neilson are tied for the most championship reigns, 5 each with various partners, while the team of Enrique and his brother Ramon Torres and the team of The Von Brauners (Kurt and Karl) hold the record for reigns as a team, three each. Art Neilson and Eddie Gosset's second reign lasted at least 434 days, the longest reign in the championship's history.\n\nThe first recognized NWA World Tag Team Champions were the team of Reggie Lisowski and Art Neilson. At the time Lisowski and Neilson held the Chicago version of the championship which was brought to the Georgia territory. The Chicago version was used as the starting point of the Georgia lineage, creating a totally separate championship when Bill and Freddie Blassie won the Georgia version in December 1955, while Lisowski and Neilson remained champions in the Chicago region. In 1969 ABC Booking stopped using the championship, although they would recognize the Mid-Atlantic version after 1975. Instead the promotion would regularly promote the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship and the NWA National Tag Team Championship as their primary championships.\n\nKey\n\nKey\n\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" scope=\"col\" |Rank\n!scope=\"col\" |Wrestler\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" scope=\"col\" |No. of reigns\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" scope=\"col\" |Combined days\n!scope=row|1\n!scope=row rowspan=2|2\n!scope=row|4\n!scope=row rowspan=2|5\n"}
{"id": "2015214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015214", "title": "Overpopulation in domestic pets", "text": "Overpopulation in domestic pets\n\nOverpopulation in domestic pets is the surplus of pets, such as cats, dogs, and exotic animals. In the United States, six to eight million animals are brought to shelters each year, of which an estimated three to four million are subsequently euthanized, including 2.7 million considered healthy and adoptable. Euthanasia numbers have declined from the 1970s, when U.S. shelters euthanized an estimated 12 to 20 million animals. Most humane societies, animal shelters and rescue groups urge animal caregivers to have their animals spayed or neutered to prevent the births of unwanted and accidental litters that could contribute to this dynamic.\n\nDealing with a population of unwanted domestic animals is a major concern to animal welfare and animal rights groups. Domestic animal overpopulation can also be an ecological concern. It is also a financial problem: capturing, impounding and eventual euthanasia costs taxpayers and private agencies millions of dollars each year. Unwanted pets are also commonly released to the wild, sometimes contributing to severe damage to ecosystems (e.g., the effect of introduction of exotic snakes to Florida's Everglades).\n\nIn Bahrain the number of stray dogs has been increasing since early 2000s with the situation getting out of hand in late 2010s which caused a lot of controversy regarding the case from people claiming to be bothered and attacked by stray dogs and stray dogs puppies being inhumanely murdered (or burned). On the other hand, since 2014 an act has been put by the Bahrain Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (BSPCA) and made a plea to the government to help keep the Catch, Neuter and Return programme (CNVR) running. Frequent attacks on farms also happened, Sheikha Marwa bint Abdulrahman Al Khalifa also contributed to the case and decided to build a shelter (welfare) for the strays to neuter and rehabilitate them to prevent further attacks while also cooperating with the Bahrain stray dogs society group.\n\nThe Canadian Federation of Humane Societies (CFHS) has been collecting statistics from Canadian animal shelters since 1993. A survey in 2013 included data from 100 of 186 humane societies and SPCAs. However, municipal animal services agencies were not included, hence \"the data in this report represents only a fraction of homeless companion animals in Canada.\" In 2012, the surveyed shelters took in just over 188,000 animals, and euthanized 65,423 animals, representing 35% of all intakes. Six times as many cats were euthanized as dogs, or 41% of cats and 15% of dogs. The report said a gradually improving trend, but that cats have a far worse outcome than dogs: \"More than twice as many cats enter shelters than dogs, and though adoption rates for cats are similar to those for dogs, fewer cats are reclaimed and many more are euthanized.\"\n\nEstimates of animals brought to shelters and of animals subsequently euthanized in the U.S. have issues with their reliability. The Humane Society of the United States provides shelter statistics with this caution: \"There is no central data reporting system for U.S. animal shelters and rescues. These estimates are based on information provided by the (former) National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy.\" The HSUS provided numbers of 6 to 8 million animals taken to shelters, 3 to 4 million animals euthanized, and 2.7 million of the euthanized animals being healthy and adoptable, as estimates for 2012–2013, and also for annual figures in an August 2014 article.\n\nThe National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy conducted a survey over four years, 1994–1997, and cautions against the use of their survey for wider estimates: \"It is not possible to use these statistics to estimate the numbers of animals entering animal shelters in the United States, or the numbers euthanized on an annual basis. The reporting Shelters may not represent a random sampling of U.S. shelters.\" Summary statistics from the survey said that in 1997, 4.3 million animals entered the surveyed shelters; the shelters euthanized 62.6% of them, or 2.8 million animals. These numbers broke down to 56.4% of dogs euthanized, and 71% of cats. The original survey was sent to 5,042 shelters housing at least 100 dogs and cats each year, of whom only 1,008 shelters participated in 1997.\n\nThe American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals provides alternate numbers, saying that there are about 13,600 community animal shelters in the US. \"There is no national organization monitoring these shelters\", and \"no government institution or animal organization is responsible for tabulating national statistics for the animal protection movement.\" However, national estimates are provided of 7.6 million animals entering shelters each year, with 2.7 million of them euthanized.\n\nThe American Humane Association said the difficulties in estimating numbers, and provides a higher figure, saying that in 2008, an estimated 3.7 million animals were euthanized in shelters.\n\nA 1993 study of US dog populations considered a wider range of sources than animal shelters. The study found that 4 million dogs entered shelters, with 2.4 million (or 60%) euthanized (p. 203).\n\nUnwanted dogs and cats may have been acquired from any source. Large numbers of animals are placed in shelters by pet owners each year for reasons such as moving, allergies, behavioral problems, and lack of time or money, or the pet animal giving birth to young. Another common reason for surrendering a pet is because of milestones, like marriage or the birth of a new baby.\n\nThe American Pet Products Association says that since purebreds are only 5% to 6% of the US pet cat population, the overpopulation problem is mainly due to mixed or random bred animals, and avoiding purebred cats would make little difference. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) says that 25% of the dogs who enter animal shelters are purebred.\n\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) and the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) say the benefits of purebred dogs or cats include that they have been developed over time to show specific traits that are useful for hunting, rescue, assistance and other needs. Animal buyers, including pet owners, may choose a purebred to ensure they know ahead of time the size and other characteristics a young animal will grow into. The CFA also says that purebred cats may make better pets because they have a weaker hunting instinct. The HSUS says that a pedigree is not a guarantee of health and temperament, and that mixed breed dogs and cats often show good characteristics of both breeds, and may be less likely to have genetic defects.\n\nThe AKC says breeders offer services and information about the animals they sell, such as a detailed pedigree, and expertise in the health and temperament of the breed they specialize in. The HSUS says animal shelters may offer animals that have already had necessary veterinary procedures, such as spaying or neutering, vaccination, deworming, and microchipping.\n\nThe best practices set by the AKC for responsible breeders include screening customers so animals are placed in a good home, and follow up services including collecting long term health and development data about animals they have bred, and guaranteeing to take back any animals if their situation is not mutually beneficial for the pet and the owner, and then placing them in a new home. The AKC says that their organization serves to prevent animal cruelty by suspending the benefits of their breed registry and other services from members convicted of animal cruelty, and that their inspection program actively uncovers cases of inhumane treatment of dogs. The HSUS says the AKC has lobbied against laws to stop puppy mills, and that many of the breeders certified as humane by AKC inspectors were later convicted of animal cruelty offenses, while the AKC says it has favored legislation that is necessary, but worked to stop well-intentioned laws that are unenforceable or counterproductive, such as kennel population limits that may harm genetic diversity. The HSUS does not advocate banning breeding but encourages prospective pet owners to seek a breed rescue organization rather than buying directly from a breeder.\n\nBackyard breeding and puppy mills are motivated by profit and the perceived high demand for a particular breed, often without concern for the health or welfare of the animals involved. These animals may be sold through pet stores or directly from the breeders themselves. The AKC says that negligence and cruelty to animals is illegal throughout the US, and that the solution to irresponsible breeding is more effective enforcement of the law, rather than blaming responsible breeders or the demand for purebred animals. The CFA's legislative stance is similar to the AKC. The CFA also says that cat overpopulation is due to free roaming, unaltered pet cats, and feral cats, not purebreds. The CFA says that animal control agencies have failed to publicize complete statistics on the killing of dogs and cats that are dangerously aggressive, concealing the degree to which pet animal euthanasia will always be unavoidable.\n\nNathan Winograd of the No Kill Advocacy Center, a promoter of no-kill shelters, says that overpopulation is a myth and logical fallacy, which many animal control agencies use to avoid criticism for high numbers of killings and low numbers of adoptions. Winograd says that traditional shelters kill animals primarily out of habit and convenience, even when space is available for the animals. He says that using trap-neuter-return (TNR) for stray and feral cats, his organizations have been able to save all healthy and treatable animals, and raise their save rates to at least 90% of all impounded animals. He says there are enough homes for all the homeless animals: \"Based on the number of existing households with pets who have a pet die or run away, more homes potentially become available each year for cats than the number of cats who enter shelters, while more than twice as many homes potentially become available each year for dogs than the number of dogs who enter shelters.\" Winograd says his methods, including TNR for stray and feral cats, and comprehensive changes in animal control, rescue, shelter and community efforts have succeeded in saving all healthy and treatable animals, amounting to at least 90% of all impounded animals. Winograd says that hundreds of No Kill Communities have been created across the U.S., and they are increasing in number throughout the world. In October 2014, the website \"Out the Front Door\" documented 212 communities in the U.S. saving more than 90% of impounded animals.\n\nChristie Keith, social media adviser for animal welfare organizations, said in 2012 that the use of the term \"overpopulation\" to justify shelter killings involves the logical fallacy of a tautology. If a shelter with no adoption program was able to save more animals when a program was added and then enhanced, was the improvement in save rates due to a \"Reduction in 'pet over-population'? Or improvement in shelter management practices?\" When communities are able to save more than 90% of the animals admitted, Keith asks, \"Did they reduce 'pet over-population,' or did they become a no-kill community by implementing modern, proven, progressive sheltering practices?\"\n\nIn a 2008 article, dog advocate Loretta Baughan said that underpopulation was the reality rather than overpopulation. She said that the great majority of pet owners have spayed or neutered their pets, and some shelters were importing large numbers of dogs from other jurisdictions.\n\n\n"}

It is responsible for overseeing government expenditures, and to ensure they are effective and honest. The committee is seen as a crucial mechanism for ensuring transparency and accountability in government financial operations, having been described by Professor the Lord Hennessy as \"the queen of the select committees...[which] by its very existence exert[s] a cleansing effect in all government departments.\"\n\nThe recommendation for the creation of a committee to oversee government accounts was first put forward in 1857 by a small group of interested Members of Parliament led by Sir Francis Baring. The structure and function of the PAC date back to reforms initiated by William Ewart Gladstone, when he was British Chancellor of the Exchequer in the 1860s. The first Public Accounts Committee was established in 1862 by a resolution of the British House of Commons:\n\nThere shall be a standing committee designated \"The Committee of Public Accounts\"; for the examination of the Accounts showing the appropriation of sums granted by Parliament to meet the Public Expenditure, to consist of nine members, who shall be nominated at the commencement of every Session, and of whom five shall be a quorum.\n\nThe form has since been replicated in virtually all Commonwealth of Nations and many non-Commonwealth countries. A minister from Her Majesty's Treasury sits on the committee but, by convention, does not attend hearings. The Chair of the committee is always drawn from the main opposition party and is usually a former senior Minister.\n\nThe Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 appointed The Committee of Public Accounts to oversee the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) The Committee continues to be assisted by the C&AG who is a permanent witness at its hearings, along with his staff of the National Audit Office, who provide briefings on each report and assist in the preparation of the Committee's own reports.\n\nThe Public Accounts Committee has criticised the expenditure on numerous government projects over the years, such as:\n\nThe Committee's members for the 2017 session of Parliament are as follows:\n\nHouse of Commons standing orders give the opposition party the right to chair the committee\n\nThe PAC is concerned that central government funding cuts left many local authorities subject to “enormous pressure” and “in a worrying financial position”.\n\n\n\n"}

The president shall take care that the laws are faithfully executed and the president has the power to appoint and remove executive officers. The president may make treaties, which need to be ratified by two-thirds of the Senate, and is accorded those foreign-affairs functions not otherwise granted to Congress or shared with the Senate. Thus, the president can control the formation and communication of foreign policy and can direct the nation's diplomatic corps. The president may also appoint Article III judges and some officers with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate. In the condition of a Senate recess, the president may make a temporary appointment.\n\nThe president of the United States is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and as such exercises supreme operational command over all national military forces of the United States. In this capacity, the president has the power to launch, direct, and supervise military operations, order or authorize the deployment of troops (in foreign countries), unilaterally launch nuclear weapons, and form military policy with the Department of Defense and Homeland Security. However, the constitutional ability to declare war is vested only in Congress.\n\nArticle II of the U.S. Constitution expressly designates the president as: \n\nU.S. ranks have their roots in British military traditions, with the president possessing ultimate authority, but no rank, maintaining a civilian status. Before 1947, the president was the only common superior of the Army (under the secretary of war) and the Navy and Marine Corps (under the secretary of the navy). The National Security Act of 1947, and the 1949 amendments to the same act, created the Department of Defense and the services (Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force) became subject to the \"authority, direction and control\" of the secretary of defense. The president and secretary of defense collectively, form the National Command Authority. The present-day operational command of the Armed Forces is delegated to the Department of Defense and is normally exercised through its Secretary. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the combatant commands assist with the operation as outlined in the presidentially approved Unified Command Plan (UCP).\nThe exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander-in-chief has been the subject of much debate throughout American history, with Congress at various times granting the president wide authority and at others attempting to restrict that authority. There is broad consensus that the framers of the Constitution intended Congress to declare war and the president to direct the war; Alexander Hamilton said that the president, although lacking the power to declare war, would have \"the direction of war when authorized or begun\". \n\nPursuant to the War Powers Resolution of 1973, Congress must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed, rendering it ineffectual. Additionally, Congress provides a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation. Presidents have historically initiated the process for going to war, but critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations, including Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama in 1903, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the invasions of Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989.\n\nThe amount of military detail handled personally by the president in wartime has varied dramatically. George Washington, the first U.S. president, firmly established military subordination under civilian authority. In 1794, Washington used his constitutional powers to assemble 12,000 militia to quell the Whiskey Rebellion—a conflict in western Pennsylvania involving armed farmers and distillers who refused to pay excise tax on spirits. According to historian Joseph Ellis, this was the \"first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field\", though James Madison briefly took control of artillery units in defense of Washington D.C. during the War of 1812.\nAbraham Lincoln was deeply involved in strategy development and day-to-day operation during the American Civil War, 1861–1865; historians have given Lincoln high praise for his strategic sense and his ability to select and encourage commanders such as Ulysses S. Grant. On the other extreme, Woodrow Wilson paid very little attention to operational military details of World War I and had very little contact with the War Department or with General John J. Pershing, who had a high degree of autonomy as commander of the armies in France. As president in World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt worked closely with his generals, and admirals, and assigned Admiral William D. Leahy as \"Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief\". Harry S. Truman believed in a high amount of civilian leadership of the military, making many tactical and policy decisions based on the recommendations of his advisors—including the decision to use atomic weapons on Japan, to commit American forces in the Korean War, and to terminate Douglas MacArthur from his command. Lyndon B. Johnson kept a very tight personal control of operations during the Vietnam War, which some historians have sharply criticized.\n\nThe Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the ensuing Gulf War in 1991 saw George H. W. Bush assemble and lead one of the largest military coalitions of nations in modern times. Confronting a major constitutional issue of murky legislation that left the wars in Korea and Vietnam without official declarations of war, Congress quickly authorized sweeping war-making powers for Bush. The leadership of George W. Bush during the War in Afghanistan and Iraq War achieved mixed results. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks by al-Qaeda, the subsequent War on Terror that followed, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq due to Iraq's alleged sponsorship of terrorism and possession of weapons of mass destruction, the speed at which the Taliban and Ba'ath Party governments in both Kabul and Baghdad were toppled by an overwhelming superiority of American and allied forces defied the predictions of many military experts. However, insufficient post-war planning and strategy by Bush and his advisors to rebuild those nations were costly.\n\nDuring the 20th century, certain area commanders came to be called commander-in-chief. As of 2011, there are nine combatant commanders; six have regional responsibilities, and three have functional responsibilities. Before 2002, the combatant commanders were referred to in daily use as commanders-in-chief (for instance \"Commander in Chief, U.S. Central Command\"), even though the positions were in fact already statutorily designated as \"combatant commander\" (CCDR). On 24 October 2002, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld announced his decision that the use of commander-in-chief would thereafter be reserved for the president only.\n\nThe president, as commander-in-chief, may also call into federal service individual state units of the National Guard. In times of war or national emergency, the Congress may grant the president broader powers to manage the national economy and protect the security of the United States, but these powers were not expressly granted by the Constitution.\n\nWithin the executive branch itself, the president has broad powers to manage national affairs and the priorities of the government. The president can issue rules, regulations, and instructions called executive orders, which have the binding force of law upon federal agencies but do not require approval of the United States Congress. Executive orders are subject to judicial review and interpretation.\n\nThe Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 put additional responsibilities on the presidency for the preparation of the United States federal budget, although Congress was required to approve it. The act required the Office of Management and Budget to assist the president with the preparation of the budget. Previous presidents had the privilege of impounding funds as they saw fit, however the United States Supreme Court revoked the privilege in 1998 as a violation of the Presentment Clause. The power was available to all presidents and was regarded as a power inherent to the office. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 was passed in response to large-scale power exercises by President Nixon. The act also created the Congressional Budget Office as a legislative counterpoint to the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nThe president has several options when presented with a bill from Congress. If the president agrees with the bill, he can sign it into law within ten days of receipt. If the president opposes the bill, he can veto it and return the bill to Congress with a veto message suggesting changes unless the Congress is out of session then the president may rely on a pocket veto.\n\nPresidents are required to approve all of a bill or none of it; selective vetoes have been prohibited. In 1996, Congress gave President Bill Clinton a line-item veto over parts of a bill that required spending federal funds. The Supreme Court, in \"Clinton v. New York City\", found Clinton's veto of pork-barrel appropriations for New York City to be unconstitutional because only a constitutional amendment could give the president line-item veto power.\n\nWhen a bill is presented for signature, the president may also issue a signing statement with expressions of their opinion on the constitutionality of a bill's provisions. The president may even declare them unenforceable but the Supreme Court has yet to address this issue.\n\nCongress may override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in both the House and the Senate. The process has traditionally been difficult and relatively rare. The threat of a presidential veto has usually provided sufficient pressure for Congress to modify a bill so the president would be willing to sign it.\n\nMuch of the legislation dealt with by Congress is drafted at the initiative of the executive branch. The president may personally propose legislation in annual and special messages to Congress including the annual State of the Union address and joint sessions of Congress. If Congress has adjourned without acting on proposals, the president may call a special session of the Congress.\n\nBeyond these official powers, the U.S. president, as a leader of his political party and the United States government, holds great sway over public opinion whereby they may influence legislation.\n\nTo improve the working relationship with Congress, presidents in recent years have set up an Office of Legislative Affairs. Presidential aides have kept abreast of all important legislative activities.\nBefore taking office, the president-elect and his transition team must appoint people to more than 6,000 federal positions. The appointments range from top officials at U.S. government agencies, to the White House Staff, and members of the United States diplomatic corps. Many, but not all, of these positions at the highest levels are appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the United States Senate.\n\nThe president also nominates persons to fill federal judicial vacancies, including federal judges, such as members of the United States courts of appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. These nominations require Senate confirmation, and this can provide a major stumbling block for presidents who wish to shape the federal judiciary in a particular ideological stance.\n\nAs head of the executive branch, the president appoints the top officials for nearly all federal agencies. These positions are listed in the Plum Book which outlines more than seven thousand appointive positions in the government. Many of these appointments are made by the president. In the case of ten agencies, the president is free to appoint a new agency head. For example, it is not unusual for the CIA's director or NASA's administrator to be changed by the president. Other agencies that deal with federal regulation such as the Federal Reserve Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission have set terms that will often outlast presidential terms. For example, governors of the Federal Reserve serve for fourteen years to ensure agency independence. The president also appoints members to the boards of directors for government-owned corporations such as Amtrak. The president can also make a recess appointment if a position needs to be filled while Congress is not in session.\n\nIn the past, presidents could appoint members of the United States civil service. This use of the spoils system allowed presidents to reward political supporters with jobs. Following the assassination of President James Garfield by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, Congress instituted a merit-based civil service in which positions are filled on a nonpartisan basis. The Office of Personnel Management now oversees the staffing of 2.8 million federal jobs in the federal bureaucracy.\n\nThe president must also appoint his staff of aides, advisers, and assistants. These individuals are political appointments and are not subject to review by the Senate. All members of the staff serve \"at the pleasure of the President\". Since 1995, the president has been required to submit an annual report to Congress listing the name and salary of every employee of the White House Office. The 2011 report listed 454 employees.\n\nArticle II of the United States Constitution gives the president the power of clemency. The two most commonly used clemency powers are those of pardon and commutation. A pardon is an official forgiveness for an acknowledged crime. Once a pardon is issued, all punishment for the crime is waived. A person seeking executive clemency by pardon, reprieve, commutation of sentence, or remission of fine shall execute a formal petition. The petition shall be addressed to the president of the United States and shall be submitted to the pardon attorney, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 20530, except for petitions relating to military offenses. A person accepting the pardon through execution of a formal petition must, however, acknowledge that the crime did take place. The president can only grant pardons for federal offences. The president maintains the Office of the Pardon Attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice to review all requests for pardons. The president can also commute a sentence which, in effect, changes the punishment to time served. While the guilty party may be released from custody or not have to serve out a prison term, all other punishments still apply.\n\nMost pardons are issued as oversight of the judicial branch, especially in cases where the Federal Sentencing Guidelines are considered too severe. This power can check the legislative and judicial branches by altering punishment for crimes. Presidents can issue blanket amnesty to forgive entire groups of people. For example, President Jimmy Carter granted amnesty to Vietnam draft dodgers who had fled to Canada. Presidents can also issue temporary suspensions of prosecution or punishment in the form of respites. This power is most commonly used to delay federal sentences of execution.\n\nPardons can be controversial when they appear to be politically motivated. President George W. Bush commuted the sentence of White House staffer Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the president is the federal official that is primarily responsible for the relations of the United States with foreign nations. The president appoints ambassadors, ministers, and consuls (subject to confirmation by the Senate) and receives foreign ambassadors and other public officials. With the secretary of state, the president manages all official contacts with foreign governments.\n\nOn occasion, the president may personally participate in summit conferences where heads of state meet for direct consultation. For example, President Wilson led the American delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 after World War I; President Franklin D. Roosevelt met with Allied leaders during World War II; and every president sits down with world leaders to discuss economic and political issues and to reach agreements.\n\nThrough the Department of State and the Department of Defense, the president is responsible for the protection of Americans abroad and of foreign nationals in the United States. The president decides whether to recognize new nations and new governments, and negotiate treaties with other nations, which become binding on the United States when approved by two-thirds of the Senate. The president may also negotiate executive agreements with foreign powers that are not subject to Senate confirmation.\n\nThe Constitution does not expressly grant the president additional powers in times of national emergency. However, many scholars think that the Framers implied these powers because the structural design of the Executive Branch enables it to act faster than the Legislative Branch. Because the Constitution remains silent on the issue, the courts cannot grant the Executive Branch these powers when it tries to wield them. The courts will only recognize a right of the Executive Branch to use emergency powers if Congress has granted such powers to the president.\n\nEmergency presidential power is not a new idea. However, the way in which it is used in the twenty-first century, presents new challenges.\n\nA claim of emergency powers was at the center of President Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus without Congressional approval in 1861. Lincoln claimed that the rebellion created an emergency that permitted him the extraordinary power of unilaterally suspending the writ. With Chief Justice Roger Taney sitting as judge, the Federal District Court of Maryland struck down the suspension in \"Ex parte Merryman\", although Lincoln ignored the order.\n\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt similarly invoked emergency powers when he issued an order directing that all Japanese Americans residing on the West Coast be placed into internment camps during World War II. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld this order in \"Korematsu v. United States\".\n\nHarry Truman declared the use of emergency powers when he nationalized private steel mills that failed to produce steel because of a labor strike in 1952. With the Korean War ongoing, Truman asserted that he could not wage war successfully if the economy failed to provide him with the material resources necessary to keep the troops well-equipped. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, refused to accept that argument in \"Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer\", voting 6-3 that neither commander-in-chief powers nor any claimed emergency powers gave the president the authority to unilaterally seize private property without Congressional legislation.\n\nCongressional legislation gives the President powers to commandeer states and governors of states, if the President deems they are engaged in insurrection. \n\nExecutive privilege gives the president the ability to withhold information from the public, Congress, and the courts in national security and diplomatic affairs. George Washington first claimed privilege when Congress requested to see Chief Justice John Jay's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with Great Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution, Washington's action created the precedent for privilege. When Richard Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed audio tapes to a special prosecutor in the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in \"United States v. Nixon\" that privilege was not absolute. The Court reasoned that the judiciary’s interest in the “fair administration of criminal justice” outweighed President Nixon’s interest in keeping the evidence secret. Later President Bill Clinton lost in federal court when he tried to assert privilege in the Lewinsky affair. The Supreme Court affirmed this in \"Clinton v. Jones\", which denied the use of privilege in cases of civil suits.\n\nBecause of the vast array of presidential roles and responsibilities, coupled with a conspicuous presence on the national and international scene, political analysts have tended to place great emphasis on the president's powers. Some have even spoken of \"the imperial presidency\", referring to the expanded role of the office that Franklin D. Roosevelt maintained during his term.\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt famously called the presidency a \"bully pulpit\" from which to raise issues nationally, for when a president raises an issue, it inevitably becomes subject to public debate. A president's power and influence may have limits, but politically the president is certainly the most important power in Washington and, furthermore, is one of the most famous and influential of all Americans.\n\nThough constrained by various other laws passed by Congress, the president's executive branch conducts most foreign policy, and their power to order and direct troops as commander-in-chief is quite significant (the exact limits of a president's military powers without Congressional authorization are open to debate). \n\nThe Separation of Powers devised by the founding fathers was designed to do one primary thing: to prevent the majority from ruling with an iron fist. Based on their experience, the framers shied away from giving any branch of the new government too much power. The separation of powers provides a system of shared power known as \"checks and balances\".

In 1992, the NIH recommended that the term \"dysplastic nevus\" be avoided in favor of the term \"atypical mole\". An atypical mole may also be referred to as an atypical melanocytic nevus, atypical nevus, B-K mole, Clark's nevus, dysplastic melanocytic nevus, or nevus with architectural disorder.\n\nDysplastic nevi often grow to larger than ordinary moles, and may have irregular and indistinct borders. Their color may not be uniform, and may range from light pink to very dark brown. They usually begin flat, but parts may be raised above the skin surface. See ABCDE and \"ugly duckling\" characteristics below.\n\nDysplastic nevi can be found anywhere, but are most common on the trunk in men, and on the calves in women.\n\nThere is some controversy in the dermatology community as to whether or not the \"dysplastic\"/\"atypical\" nevus exists. Some have argued that the terms \"dysplastic\" and \"atypical\" only refer to diagnostic uncertainty, as opposed to biologic uncertainty, and that the lesion is either a nevus or melanoma from the very beginning, as opposed to some kind of \"premalignant stage\"; it is only the clinician who is unsure. Some have also argued that even if such nevi do exist, studies have shown that clinicians are unable to reliably identify them anyway, meaning there is no point to even using the concept.\n\nAs seen in Caucasian individuals in the United States, those with dysplastic nevi have a lifetime risk of developing melanoma of greater than 10%, compared to less than 1% for those without any dysplastic nevus.\n\nAlthough there are limited data to support its efficacy, skin self-examination is frequently recommended for preventing melanoma (by identifying atypical moles that can be removed) or for early detection of existing tumors. Examination by a dermatologist has been shown to be beneficial for early melanoma detection. Some dermatologists recommend that an individual with either histologic diagnosis of dysplastic nevus, or clinically apparent atypical moles should be examined by an experienced dermatologist with dermatoscopy once a year (or more frequently).\nThe abbreviation ABCDE has been useful for helping health care providers and laypersons remember the key characteristics of a melanoma (see \"ABCDE\" mnemonic below). Changes (in shape, size, color, itching or bleeding) should be brought to the attention of a dermatologist .\n\nA popular method for remembering the signs and symptoms of melanoma is the mnemonic \"ABCDE\":\n\nThe E is sometimes omitted, as in the ABCD guideline. A weakness in this system is the D. Many melanomas present themselves as lesions smaller than 6 mm in diameter. An astute physician will examine all abnormal moles, including ones less than 6 mm in diameter. Unfortunately for the average person, many seborrheic keratoses, some lentigo senilis, and even warts may have ABCD characteristics, and cannot be distinguished from a melanoma without a trained eye or dermatoscopy.\n\nA recent and novel method of melanoma detection is the \"Ugly Duckling Sign\". It is simple, easy to teach, and highly effective in detecting melanoma. Simply, correlation of common characteristics of a person's skin lesion is made. Lesions which greatly deviate from the common characteristics are labeled as an \"Ugly Duckling\", and a dermatologist exam is required. The \"Little Red Riding Hood\" sign suggests that individuals with fair skin and light colored hair might prove more challenging. These fair-skinned individuals often have lightly pigmented or amelanotic melanomas which will not present with easy to observe color changes and variation in colors. The borders of these amelanotic melanomas are often indistinct, making visual identification without a dermatoscope (dermatoscopy) very difficult. A dermatoscope must be used to detect \"ugly ducklings\" among those with light skin or blonde/red hair.\n\nPeople with a personal or family history of skin cancer or of dysplastic nevus syndrome (multiple atypical moles) should see a dermatologist at least once a year to be sure they are not developing melanoma.\n\nWhen an atypical mole has been identified, a skin biopsy takes place in order to best diagnose it. Local anesthetic is used to numb the area, then the mole is biopsied. The biopsy material is then sent to a laboratory to be evaluated by a pathologist. A skin biopsy can be a punch, shave, or complete excision. The complete excision is the preferred method, but a punch biopsy can suffice if the patient has cosmetic concerns (i.e. the patient does not want a scar) and the lesion is small. A scoop or deep shave biopsy is often advocated, but should be avoided due to risk of a recurrent nevus, which can complicate future diagnosis of a melanoma, and the possibility that resulting scar tissue can obscure tumor depth if a melanoma is found to be present and re-excised.\n\nMost dermatologists and dermatopathologists use a system devised by the NIH for classifying melanocytic lesions. In this classification, a nevus can be defined as benign, having atypia, or being a melanoma. A benign nevus is read as (or understood as) having no cytologic or architectural atypia. An atypical mole is read as having architectural atypia, and having (mild, moderate, or severe) cytologic (melanocytic) atypia. Usually, cytologic atypia is of more important clinical concern than architectural atypia. Usually, moderate to severe cytologic atypia will require further excision to make sure that the surgical margin is completely clear of the lesion.\n\nThe most important aspect of the biopsy report is that the pathologist indicates if the margin is clear (negative or free of melanocytic nevus), or if further tissue (a second surgery) is required. If this is not mentioned, usually a dermatologist or clinician will require further surgery if moderate to severe cytologic atypia is present – and if residual nevus is present at the surgical margin.\n\n\"Dysplastic nevus syndrome\" refers to individuals who have high numbers of benign moles and also have dysplastic nevi. A small percent of these individuals are members of melanoma kindreds. Inherited dysplastic nevus syndrome is an autosomal dominant hereditary condition. Dysplastic nevi are more likely to undergo malignant transformation when they occur among members of melanoma families. At least one study indicates a cumulative lifetime risk of nearly 100% in individuals who have dysplastic nevi and are members of melanoma kindreds.\nRoughly 70% of melanomas arise \"de novo\" on clear skin growth, whereas the rest arise within atypical moles. Those with dysplastic nevi have an elevated risk of melanoma. Such persons need to be checked regularly for any changes in their moles and to note any new ones. In 40-50% of cases, the disorder has been linked with germline mutations in the CDKN2A gene, which codes for p16 (a regulator of cell division).\n\n\n"}

It has a capacity of 110,000 spectators, including 60,000 seats. Since 1992, the circuit has also been part of the Superbike World Championship calendar. \n\nThe original Assen track was first used for the 1925 Dutch TT (Tourist Trophy) race, held on country roads through the villages of Borger, Schoonloo and Grolloo, and organized by the \"Motorclub Assen en Omstreken\". The brick-paved track had a length of . The winner was Piet van Wijngaarden on a 500 cc Norton with an average speed of .

The main KSCA programming is heard on the primary channel with \"Recuerdo,\" a Spanish-language oldies format, heard on the HD-2 channel. KSCA is also broadcast on a 90-watt booster station in Santa Clarita, California, KSCA-FM1 at 101.9.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on March 22, 1952 as KUTE, originally programming a \"good music\" format from studios in downtown Los Angeles and transmitter atop Flint Peak, just west of the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. It was owned by Robert P. Adams, who served as its president and general manager.\n\nIn 1972, KUTE was sold to the Progress Radio Network (which changed its name to Tracy Broadcasting one year later) and changed hands again in 1979 to Inner City Broadcasting Corporation, a black-owned radio company based in New York City. It was during this tenure that KUTE shifted to a Disco format under Inner City's first year of ownership.\n\nUnder Inner City's ownership, KUTE became one of the original stations in the United States to launch a format that would later be called urban contemporary (after shifting away from Disco in 1980), playing the latest R&B, funk and soul music, featuring local DJs such as \"Humble Harve\", Brian Roberts and \"Lucky Pierre.\" KUTE was also the starting point for many successful radio careers, including veteran PD Rick Thomas, who was hired in 1982 to do weekends on air by then PD Lucky Pierre. During this time, mornings were hosted by Brian Roberts, afternoon drive by Charlie Fox and evenings with Joe Greene. Weekends also featured Ed Mann, Buster Jones, Scott Lockwood and Strawberry Jan Marie. \n\nAt 2:00 a.m. on Sunday mornings, KUTE 102 would host an hour of disco/dance mixes, usually pre-mixed vinyl albums specially created for DJs. KUTE 102 was one of the first radio stations to air a \"mega-mix\" when the \"Michael Jackson Mega-Mix\" debuted in the summer of 1983, capitalizing on the success of Jackson's Thriller album earlier in the year. DJ Mario Flores later hosted a disco dance DJ 12\" specialty show Sunday mornings from 2:00 am to 3:00 am featuring 15-minute disco mixes, mixed by well known DJs around the U.S.\n\nKUTE was quite successful in this format. In late 1983, KUTE became a template for Urban Adult Contemporary stations today, changing its format to a sound known as \"The Quiet Storm.\" In August 1985, Gene Autry's Golden West Broadcasters, which owned AM 710 KMPC (now KSPN), bought KUTE for between $10 and $16 million.\n\nGolden West initially maintained the Quiet Storm format, but its ratings plummeted by 50% in 1987, prompting the station to fire its airstaff and prepare for a new direction. On October 4, 1987, KUTE changed its call sign to KMPC-FM with a format dubbed \"Full Spectrum Rock\", a mixture of classic rock, adult album alternative and progressive rock.

The call sign switched to KSCA on September 1, 1994 upon FCC approval. It was known as \"Southern California's Album Alternative\" and later morphed into \"LA's Finest Rock\". \n\nMike Morrison joined as Program Director from WXPN, Philadelphia. Nicole Sandler, formerly with LA rock station KLOS and The Mark & Brian Show, joined for middays. The station later hired Chuck Moshontz, also from KLOS and paired him with Nicole to do mornings.

The \"KSCA Music Hall\" (the hallway outside the deejay booth) hosted live performances by dozens of artists, some of whom had their debuts there before going on to superstardom, including the Dave Matthews Band. This format lasted until Midnight on February 5, 1997, when Golden West Broadcasting sold off its last radio property. The last song on FM 101.9 was \"Her Majesty\" by The Beatles, which was preceded by a brief monologue from general manager of KSCA, Bill Ward.\n\nKSCA was bought by the Heftel Broadcasting Corporation in February 1997 for $112.5 million. At 12:01 a.m. on February 5th, the station signed off the air for about six hours; around 6:15 that evening, following a 12-hour loop of a laugh track, KSCA became \"La Nueva 101.9,\" switching to a Spanish-language Ranchera music format, aimed at Los Angeles' growing Mexican-American population. At the time, Southern California only had a couple of full power FM stations broadcasting in Spanish, 107.5 KLVE, airing a Latin Soft AC format, and 97.9 KLAX-FM, which was also broadcasting Regional Mexican music. \n\nKSCA's morning host, Eddie \"Piolín\" Sotelo, co-sponsored a large immigration rally in Los Angeles on March 25, 2006, along with other local radio personalities including KLAX's \"El Cucuy\" Renán Almendaríz. An estimated half-million protesters marched through Downtown LA. The morning show is now called \"El Bueno, La Mala y El Feo\" (The Good, The Bad and The Ugly).\n\nOn September 16, 2011, KSCA rebranded from \"La Nueva 101.9\" to \"LA 101.9\". On March 1, 2016, the station rebranded again, to \"Zona MX 101.9\".\n\nIn March 2019, KSCA joined the Uforia Audio Network, one of two networks owned by Univision. \n\n"}

{"id": "2015315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015315", "title": "Beauty and the Beast (musical)", "text": "Beauty and the Beast (musical)\n\nBeauty and the Beast is a musical with music by Alan Menken, lyrics by Howard Ashman and Tim Rice, and book by Linda Woolverton. Adapted from Walt Disney Pictures' Academy Award-winning 1991 animated musical film of the same name – which in turn had been based on the classic French fairy tale by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont – \"Beauty and the Beast\" tells the story of a cold-blooded prince who has been magically transformed into an unsightly creature as punishment for his selfish ways. To revert into his true human form, the Beast must first learn to love a bright, beautiful young woman whom he has imprisoned in his enchanted castle before it is too late.\n\nCritics, who hailed it as one of the year's finest musicals, immediately noted the film's Broadway musical potential when it was first released in 1991, encouraging Disney CEO Michael Eisner to venture into Broadway. All eight songs from the animated film were reused in the musical, including a resurrected musical number which had been cut from the motion picture. Original songwriter Menken composed six new songs for the production alongside lyricist Rice, replacing Ashman who had died during production of the film. Woolverton, who had written the film's screenplay, adapted her own work into the musical's libretto, and specifically expanded upon the characterization of the Beast. Woolverton also expanded the storylines of the castle staff from servants who had already been transformed into household objects into humans who were gradually turning into inanimate objects. Costumes were designed by Ann Hould-Ward, who based her creations on both the animators' original designs as well as the Rococo art movement after researching how clothing and household objects looked during the 18th century.\n\nAfter completing tryouts in Houston, \"Beauty and the Beast\" premiered on Broadway on April 18, 1994, starring Susan Egan and Terrence Mann as the eponymous Belle and Beast, respectively. The musical opened to mixed reviews from theatre critics, but was a massive commercial success and well received by audiences. \"Beauty\" ran on Broadway for 5,461 performances for thirteen years (1994 - 2007), becoming Broadway's tenth longest-running production in history. The musical has grossed more than $1.7 billon worldwide and played in thirteen countries and 115 cities. It has also become a popular choice for junior, amateur and high school productions.\n\nStill recovering from Walt Disney's demise, Disney's animated films continued to experience a noticeable decline in quality while struggling to attain critical and commercial success during the 1970s and 1980s. The Walt Disney Company CEO Michael Eisner was hired to ensure the performance of the studio's next animated projects, despite having virtually no animation experience. Eisner himself had been a theatre major in college. Eisner's first hire as Disney's CEO was theatrical producer Peter Schneider, who subsequently became responsible for hiring more artists who shared similar theatrical backgrounds to contribute to the studio's next animated releases, among them lyricist Howard Ashman and his long-time collaborator, composer Alan Menken. Ashman and Menken had previously amassed great live musical success with their Off-Broadway production \"Little Shop of Horrors\", but the performance of Ashman's first Broadway venture \"Smile\" had been disappointing. Eager to redeem himself, Ashman agreed to work on Disney's animated film \"The Little Mermaid\" (1989), which he and Menken would famously decide to approach as though they were scoring a Broadway musical. Upon release, \"The Little Mermaid\" was a massive critical and commercial success, garnering two Academy Awards, both of them for Ashman and Menken's original music. Disney established a successful renaissance period, during which Ashman and Menken became responsible for teaching the art of transforming traditional animated films into animated musicals.\n\nInspired by \"Mermaid\"s success, production on an animated musical adaptation of the \"Beauty and the Beast\" fairy tale began shortly afterward, during which Ashman finally confessed to Menken that he was dying of AIDS, a secret he had been keeping from the studio in fear of being discriminated against or fired. Before the film had even been completed, executive vice president Ron Logan suggested to Eisner that he consider adapting \"Beauty and the Beast\" for Broadway, an idea Eisner quickly deflected. While the film, written by screenwriter Linda Woolverton, was premiering at the New York Film Festival, an ailing Ashman was being cared for at St. Vincent's Hospital; the lyricist succumbed to his disease four days later on March 14, 1991, dying eight months before the film's November release. \"Beauty and the Beast\" became the last project on which Menken worked with Ashman. The film was released to immediate critical acclaim and commercial success, outperforming \"The Little Mermaid\" by becoming the highest-grossing animated film in history, as well as the first animated film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. Once again, Academy Awards were won for Ashman and Menken's music. Several critics noticed the film's live musical potential, among them prolific \"New York Times\" theatre critic Frank Rich. Lamenting the Broadway selection at the time, Rich famously praised the songwriting duo for having written \"[t]he best Broadway musical score of 1991\", while hailing the film as a \"better [musical] ... than anything he had seen on Broadway\" in 1991. Rich's review would ultimately provide Eisner and Katzenberg with the confidence needed to seriously consider the film as a potential Broadway project. Disney was also inspired by the successes of Broadway musicals such as \"Cats\", \"Les Misérables\" and \"The Phantom of the Opera\" strongly believing their production could be just as profitable.\n\nVirtually unknown at the time, Robert Jess Roth was appointed the production's director based on his various successes directing live shows at the Disney theme parks. Eisner and Katzenberg had opted against hiring a more established director in order to retain creative control over the project, believing that an A-list director would likely feel more inclined to challenge their vision. Roth himself had previously pursued Eisner about investing in a Broadway show – originally suggesting a stage adaptation of \"Mary Poppins\" into a Broadway musical in 1984 – only to have his idea declined, citing cost of investment and time concerns. However, Eisner invited Roth to ask him about pursuing Broadway again in the future once he had finished directing three additional Disney theme park shows. Ultimately impressed with Roth's adaptation of \"The Nutcracker\", Eisner finally suggested an adaptation of \"Beauty and the Beast\", inspired by the success of a condensed stage version of the film at Disneyland, although briefly discouraged by the idea of having humans instantly transformed into inanimate objects live. Since the film had not yet been released on home video, Roth spent an entire day re-watching \"Beauty and the Beast\" in theaters while brainstorming how to present its fantastical elements onstage, and eventually worked with choreographer Matt West and set designer Stan Meyer on their own proposal, with contributions from Menken and Woolverton. In a hotel in Aspen, Roth convinced Eisner and Katzenberg to green-light a Broadway adaptation of \"Beauty and the Beast\" using a combination of 140 storyboards, costume sketches, fabric swatches and demonstrating one illusion. Eisner retained final approval over all creative elements of the production, \"from the lowest chorus swing performer to the director, stars and design team.\" Menken was initially skeptical of Roth's qualifications, as he had never directed a Broadway show before. Meanwhile, the producers were concerned that audiences might not be interested in seeing the same story that they have enjoyed on film on the Broadway stage. Among the skeptics was theatrical producer Steven Suskin, author of \"Opening Night and Broadway\", who argued that the production was more likely to be successful in reverse: \"(The movie is) basically written as a theater piece. I'm sure it would've worked in the theater first, and it then would've worked in the movies,\" believing audiences would have difficulties accepting a new version of such an immensely popular work.\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast\" became Disney's first Broadway venture, although \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", a stage adaptation of Disney's animated film of the same name, had premiered in New York in 1979, produced by Radio City Music Hall Productions, Inc. Theatre Under the Stars' executive director Frank Young campaigned heavily to have the show open in Houston, Texas even getting Governor Ann Richards involved in order to secure the stage rights.\n\nRoth summarized \"Beauty and the Beast\" as a story about \"seeing past the exterior of a person and into his or her heart\". Woolverton learned that Disney had commissioned her to adapt the animated film she had written into a Broadway musical while she was vacationing with her family in Maui, and her initial response to the idea was \"Yikes.\" In the process of adapting her own animated screenplay into a full-length, two-act libretto for the stage, Woolverton contributed several distinct changes to the material, specifically instilling more emotional \"depth\" into each main character. The writer expanded the story by both \"fleshing out\" each character and allowing room for new musical numbers. Namely, Woolverton made the Beast a more threatening yet sympathetic figure; the writer expanded upon his characterization by developing the Beast into \"a fuller character\", aided by the addition of his own song, \"If I Can't Love Her\". Meanwhile, the book-loving Belle was adapted into a more headstrong and determined heroine. Belle and the Beast's relationship benefits from a new scene Woolverton wrote specifically for the stage, during which the couple read in the castle's library; Belle introduces the Beast to the tale of \"King Arthur\" and reads the book to him, to which the Beast responds by showing genuine vulnerability for the first time.\n\nIn 1993, Woolverton explained to the \"Los Angeles Times\" that \"the mythology in the story would be changed to explain, for example, a 6-foot-tall candelabra.\" Perhaps Woolverton's most significant modification involves the enchanted objects, and the decision to have the enchantress' spell gradually transform the castle's staff of loyal servants into household objects throughout the entire duration of the musical, as opposed to having already done so immediately at the beginning. Essentially, becoming completely inanimate if the spell is not broken in time would equate to each character dying, which ultimately augments the story's drama. Consequently, this plot decision enhanced the story into a tale about people being forced to make difficult decisions, as opposed to solely a story of a man struggling to retain his humanity, in turn providing the audience with an opportunity to care about the supporting characters dramatically.\n\nGenerally, Woolverton's book remained quite faithful to the original text; the plot is essentially the same, but particular detail has been added in order to \"flesh out\" the story. The feather duster and wardrobe characters – only minor characters in the animated film – were broadened into fully realized supporting characters and named for the first time; Woolverton named them Babette and Madame de la Grande Bouche, respectively. Taking her job seriously, Woolverton worked relentlessly on revising the script, and often took the cast's suggestions into consideration (though not always yielding to their opinions). Despite the musical having been based on a pre-existing story by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont, Woolverton retains a sole writing credit for her work, as the story had long lapsed into the public domain by that time.\n\nBroadway producers are usually eager to cast big-named performers in their musicals, but Katzenberg, famous at the time for avoiding working with actors of such caliber, decided against this practice for \"Beauty and the Beast\". Eisner concluded that most of the film's original voice actors would be too busy to reprise their roles onstage. In her Broadway debut, then-22-year-old actress Susan Egan was cast as the musical's original Belle. Egan, who had not yet seen the film, had been auditioning for several other Broadway projects at the time – namely \"My Fair Lady\", \"Carousel\" and \"Grease\" – in which she was much more interested. Despite longing to originate a Broadway role, the actress was initially reluctant to audition for \"Beauty and the Beast\" because she thought that \"it was a terrible idea for Disney to put a cartoon on Broadway.\" Additionally, Egan felt she was not attractive enough to play a character touted \"the most beautiful girl in the village\", but her agent managed to convince her otherwise. Without any film to reference, Egan determined that Belle is supposed to be a \"quirky\" character and approached her funnier than how she is depicted in the film, in turn garnering laughs from the producers – who were amused by her unique interpretation – and eventually earning several callbacks. Meanwhile, her competition of 500 actresses, many of whom were simply offering imitations of voice actress Paige O'Hara's original performance, continued to be eliminated.\n\nEgan's final week of auditions, during which she sang for Menken for the first time, was particularly challenging. On her last day of auditioning, Egan auditioned opposite several different actors trying out for the roles of the Beast and Gaston. As the day concluded, Roth directed Egan to approach the role as \"a straight ingénue\", and she was ultimately cast upon proving capable of playing Belle both straight and comically. Only afterward did Egan celebrate by finally renting and watching the entire film for the first time. Although Egan did not feel particularly pressured about the role, she was grateful to be surrounded by a supporting cast of veteran Broadway performers.\n\nActor Terrence Mann was cast as the Beast. Mann had previously performed as Javert in \"Les Misérables\", for which he was nominated for a Tony Award. For his final audition for Disney management, Mann performed for a large audience comprising Disney executives and secretaries in a theatre located on 42nd Street, which he felt was in stark contrast to the usual method of auditioning for six to eight people in a dark theatre. Actor Gary Beach was cast as Lumiere. Beach had seen \"Beauty and the Beast\" premiere at the El Capitan Theatre, prior to which he had watched a stage rendition of the film, and thoroughly enjoyed both. Beach was particularly drawn to Jerry Orbach's rendition of \"Be Our Guest\" in his role as Lumiere, thinking, \"Now why can't I get a part like that\". Two years later, Beach received a call from casting director Jay Binder inviting him to play Lumiere during their workshop of \"Beauty and the Beast\", but kept turning down the offer due to having prior commitments to an upcoming show starring comedian Carol Burnett. It was only at Burnett's insistence that Beach finally accepted. Amidst a cast of relatively obscure actors, Tom Bosley, famous for his roles on the television series \"Happy Days\" and \"Murder, She Wrote\", became the show's most recognizable performer when he was cast as Belle's father Maurice.\n\nAll eight of the film's original songs were retained for the Broadway adaptation. The song \"Human Again\" had originally been written for the film, but it was ultimately abandoned due to time and story constraints; the musical number was finally resurrected for and included in the production. Composer Alan Menken, who had both scored and written the film's songs alongside lyricist Howard Ashman, returned to the project to write six new songs for the musical. Lyricist Tim Rice joined Menken to co-write the new numbers, replacing Ashman who had died in 1991, before the film was released. Both Menken and Rice initially approached the project with some resistance; Menken's emotional attachment to the music he had written with Ashman made him fear Disney's vision of a Broadway musical would transform \"Beauty and the Beast\" into an attraction too similar to what one would find at Walt Disney World. Meanwhile, Rice, who had previously worked as composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's lyricist on the Broadway musicals \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" and \"Evita\", was hesitant to replace Ashman in fear of worsening \"Beauty and the Beast\". Notably, Rice had similarly replaced Ashman to write the remaining songs for Disney's \"Aladdin\" (1992) after the lyricist died. Ultimately, the collaboration resulted in approximately half of the Broadway score having co-writing credits by Menken and Ashman, while the remaining half are Menken and Rice compositions. The Menken-Rice songs are sometimes billed as \"additional songs composed by [Alan] Menken and lyrics by Tim Rice.\" On working on the musical without Ashman, Menken explained that \"The main challenge ... was blending the lyrics of Tim Rice with those of Howard. In the end, the finished score has a quality all its own; a hybrid between\" Ashman and Rice's styles. Elaborating on the main difference between writing songs for the stage as opposed to film, Menken stated that the lack of close-ups and montages in a live musical production creates a requirement for more singing material in order \"to provide the same kind of illumination that intimate facial expression provides.\"\n\nMost of the new material focused on character development, such as Gaston's \"Me\", Belle's \"Home\" and the Beast's \"If I Can't Love Her\". Other new songs, Maurice's fatherly ballad \"No Matter What\" and Gaston, LeFou, and Monsieur D'Arque's villainous number \"Maison des Lunes\", were written to flesh out the plot (and in the case of Maison Des Lunes, give Belle and the Beast a longer chance to change into their ballroom outfit). In 1998, a seventh song entitled \"A Change in Me\" was written four years into production's run specifically for R&B singer Toni Braxton when she joined the cast to play Belle, and appears during the show's second act. The idea for the song originated while Braxton was still in negotiations with Disney to appear in the show for a total of three months, but various circumstances led to the singer constantly delaying signing the contract. It was not until Braxton had dinner with Menken, Rice and West that she finally agreed to sign the contract under the condition that a brand new song be written specifically for her, which an intoxicated Rice had drunkenly offered and promised. When confronted by Roth about his promise upon learning of it from Braxton a few days later, within 24 hours Rice successfully discovered a location within the musical in which to include a new song, specifically \"Where Belle tells Maurice about how the time that she spent with the Beast in his castle has changed her.\" That song ultimately became the ballad \"A Change in Me\", which lyrically addresses the ways in which Belle's initial motivations have ultimately changed during her imprisonment, explaining to Maurice that she has matured and no longer longs for what she originally cited in \"Belle (Reprise)\". Braxton premiered the song in the form of a live performance on \"The Rosie O'Donnell Show\". Both the song and Braxton's performance were well received, and \"A Change in Me\" has been included in the musical ever since. Eisner especially enjoyed the song, demanding that it be included in international productions as well, to which he personally traveled in order to teach it to the cast.\n\nMusic supervision was handled by Michael Kosarin, with sound design by John Petrafesa Jr. Unlike in the film, Belle actually performs and dances alongside the enchanted objects during \"Be Our Guest\", which resembles \"a high-energy Vegas number\" similar to the musical \"Ziegfeld Follies\". The original Broadway cast recording of \"Beauty and the Beast\" was released by Walt Disney Records in 1994. Similar cast albums followed suit, including Australian and Japanese recordings in 1994 and 1996, respectively. \"A Change in Me\" has yet to be included on any official English-language cast recordings.\n\nStanley Meyer designed the production's set. Following Disney's instructions \"to make the animated film come to life\", Meyer's set was very much a literal interpretation of the film. Meyer found it \"tricky\" to translate two-dimensional environments into a three-dimensional world. The West Wing's appearance mirrors that of its resident the Beast, being hideous on the outside but beautiful when the audience is finally taken inside of it. In stark contrast to popular musicals \"The Phantom of the Opera\" and \"Into the Woods\", \"Beauty and the Beast\"s set resembles a hybrid of Gothic Victorian and Louis Quinze. Disney hired costume designer Ann Hould-Ward to design the musical's costumes because the studio enjoyed a \"certain aesthetic\" she had used in her previous work, and thus allowed her much creative freedom. Roth was particularly impressed with the designer's contributions to the musicals \"Sunday in the Park With George\" and \"Into the Woods\". Hould-Ward accepted Disney's offer because she was interested in seeing exactly how a corporate company producing a Broadway musical for the first time would \"change the Broadway world.\" Conceptualization began in summer 1992. For research purposes, Disney encouraged Hould-Ward to reference the animated film; she also researched clothing worn throughout the late 18th century, during which the original fairy tale was written, and spent one year discovering how household items looked during the mid-1700s. Additionally, Hould-Ward visited with \"Beauty and the Beast\"s original animators, spending one week learning how they created their characters to ensure that they would be recognizable to those who had seen the film. However, the designer also decided that her own creations would not exactly replicate the film's. Basing the costumes on the Rococo art movement, Hould-Ward presented her initial ideas to Eisner and then-Disney president Frank Wells. Once approved, Hould-Ward and her team spent the following year creating prototypes of each major costume. With an unusually long work schedule of two years, Hould-Ward recalled that \"this kind of timeline ... wasn't the norm in a Broadway musical\" at the time.\n\nThe process of designing \"Beauty and the Beast\"s costumes was more collaborative between designer and actor than most other Broadway productions Hould-Ward had previously worked on, and she frequently sought input from the cast to make sure they were able to move. Designing Belle's costumes was an \"easy\" task for Hould-Ward; the character is initially dressed in standard Disney heroine attire until replaced by more elaborate costumes once Belle meets the Beast. Hould-Ward based the character's famous yellow ballgown on several historic portraits. The gown became the first costume built for the production in order to accommodate Disney's mandate to market the dress in photoshoots and commercials starring Egan and Mann, six months prior to rehearsals. Weighing 45 pounds, the dress is a combination of various patterns and materials, including a hoop skirt, silk, brocade, beading, flowers and bows. Too large to fit inside Egan's dressing room after the ballroom sequence, undressing required assistance from three backstage crew members who used wires to hoist the dress up into the rafters, where it would be stored until the next performance. A lot of time was spent designing the Beast's costume, the creation of which was especially challenging due to requirements to \"allow enough of the performer to show through.\" Hould-Ward's initial designs for the Beast were constantly rejected by Katzenberg, who reiterated that she \"put the movie onstage\" until the producer realized that the excessive prosthetics were limiting Mann's vocal performance. A wire frame was also used to maintain the costume's shape, which evokes heavy metal fashion until ultimately substituted for a black Oscar de la Renta-inspired velvet suit when the Beast finally transforms back into a prince. Hould-Ward designed the leads' costumes from the perspective of her daughter Leah, explaining, \"when Leah comes to see it, she remembers from the movie that the Beast was in that blue jacket. Leah expects that blue jacket, and if you don't give it to her, she and a lot of other ten-year-olds are going to be sad\". At the same time, the designer wanted her creations to be equally as interesting on an intellectual level for parents to enjoy also.\n\nThe challenge of designing Belle and the Beast's costumes paled in comparison to the difficulty of creating the enchanted objects, a combination of intricate wiring, prosthetics and pyrotechnics. Scale was the most prominent \"obstacle\" for Hould-Ward's to overcome: \"The problem was the presentation of an actor as a life-sized teapot when the characters in the film were so little in comparison\". Because the castle's enchanted staff is slowly transforming into objects, shown at various stages of transformation without ever completely becoming the objects themselves, Hould-Ward was required to create several different costumes for each character in order to depict the transformation as the show progresses. Meanwhile, the costume of Lumiere alone was built by a team of forty people, including a creator of the prosthetic candle, hair and Vacuform specialist; the pyrotechnician, man responsible for equipping the costume's pyro unit with butane and man operating the butane tank were each separate people. While transforming animation into real life, Hould-Ward also worked on incorporating the human body each costume, explaining, \"I wanted the reality of the real person rather than the fantasy of the object ... The essence of my job is to allow my real actors to take you to this fantastical place.\" A system of wired frames was used to help the actors support their characters' heavy garments. Such elaborate costumes had never been designed for a Broadway production before. Cogsworth's costume features a fully functioning clock on his face. Meanwhile, Madame de la Grande Bouche was the production's most expensive costume.\n\nThe musical originally relied on heavy prosthetics and elaborate costumes in an attempt to make the musical resemble the film as closely as possible. In an attempt to replicate the film's famous movie poster, Egan was dressed in flats while Mann was positioned on stilts to establish a more dramatic height difference. According to Egan, the studio \"didn't trust the audience's ability to suspend disbelief, something theater-goers are routinely asked to do.\" However, the company finally began to relent as the production neared Houston tryouts after a final run-through during which the actors did not wear costumes; thus, the prosthetics were gradually lessened and replaced by make up for the Beast and enchanted objects during 1993 previews. The elaborate costumes resulted in their fair share of technical difficulties, malfunctions and performance restrictions, many of which manifested during the seven-week tryouts in Houston. The costumes left little room for the performers to change between scenes, and air conditioners were fastened to them to regulate their temperatures. In general, the weight of the enchanted objects' costumes limited their dancing. Chiropractors and therapists remained on standby to assist Fowler, whose Mrs. Potts costume required her to always keep one arm in the air. Beach compared holding up the two propane tanks used to represent Lumiere's candles to carrying two hams around a grocery store two and a half hours. To build his stamina, Beach would carry the tanks during rehearsal. Beach's hand caught fire during one performance, which he did not notice until Mann subtly pointed it out using \"furtive head nods\". While dancing, the inertia of Egan's heavy ballgown caused its skirt to constantly pull her in the opposite direction of whichever way she turned. Mann likened performing in the Beast's costume to wearing several heavy winter coats, comparing the wig to \"four Angora cats and gaffer taping them to your head and then running around the block 10 or 12 times.\" Disney was outraged when, after their first performance at the Palace Theatre, \"The New York Times\" published caricaturist Al Hirschfeld's line drawing interpretation of Belle and the Beast's pose, in which Belle's yellow gown was colored pink, and the Beast's tuxedo appeared greenish as opposed to royal blue. When Disney confronted Hirschfeld, the artist defended his work, explaining, \"The costumes may have been blue and yellow, but they made me feel green and pink.\" Hould-Ward adjusted the costumes to accommodate the locations as the production traveled to various theaters.\n\nLighting designer Natasha Katz was hired to work on \"Beauty and the Beast\". When Disney first approached Katz to offer her the job, several of Katz's cohorts – specifically other lighting designers – attempted to discourage her from accepting in fear of changing the appearance of musical theatre forever. In hindsight, Katz defended Disney's work, explaining, \"\"Beauty and the Beast\" didn't bring theatre back to New York, but it did change the dynamic, no question about it, of the business.\" Known for assisting David Copperfield with his illusions, Roth hired Jim Steinmeyer to work on \"Beauty and the Beast\". Steinmeyer had previously contributed to the musical \"Merlin\". The Beast's transformation sequence during the second act was much-discussed. It took about 11 weeks to set the design.\n\nOn a cold winter's night, an old beggar woman comes to a young spoiled prince's castle, offering him a single rose in return for shelter. But the prince turns her away solely for her appearance. The old woman warns him not to be fooled by appearances, as true beauty lies within, only to be rejected again. She then transforms into a beautiful enchantress and turns the prince into a hideous Beast and his servants into various household objects. She gives him the rose to use as an hour-glass. The only way he can break the spell is to learn to love another and earn her love in return by the time the last petal falls (\"Prologue\").\n\nTen years later, a beautiful young girl named Belle makes her way into town one morning in order to get a book from the local bookseller. On the way she expresses her wish to live in a world like her books, full of adventure, while the townspeople note her unparalleled beauty but find her love of books odd (\"Belle\"). Belle has also attracted the attention of Gaston (the local hunter and town hero), who admires her only for her beauty.\n\nBelle, however, is not oblivious to her peers' views of her. She voices her concerns about it to her eccentric father and inventor, Maurice who assures her that she is anything but strange (\"No Matter What\"). The two then put the finishing touches on his invention and Maurice heads off to an invention fair donning a scarf knitted for him by Belle (\"No Matter What (Reprise)\"), but becomes lost in the woods and attacked by a pack of wolves. After surviving a wolf attack, he enters the Beast's castle and meets the servants, including Lumière, a maître d' turned into a candelabra, Cogsworth, the head of household turned into a clock, Babette, a maid turned into a feather duster that still seems to retain her flirtatious tendencies, Mrs. Potts, the head of the kitchen turned into a teapot, and Chip, her son turned into a teacup. They welcome him, but the horrid Beast arrives and locks Maurice away in the dungeon for trespassing.\n\nBack in town, Gaston proposes to Belle, which she politely rejects (\"Me\"). Appalled by Gaston's forwardness, Belle once again voices her need for a life outside this provincial life (\"Belle (Reprise)\"). Gaston's sidekick, LeFou, returns from the woods wearing the scarf Belle knitted for Maurice. Belle realizes her father is in danger and heads into the woods to look for him. She ends up at the castle where she finds her father locked away in a dungeon. She makes a deal with the Beast, Maurice goes free but she remains instead. They agree and Maurice is sent back to town without being allowed to say goodbye. Belle is given a guest room and ordered by the Beast to join him for dinner. She mourns her situation (\"Home\"), but Mrs. Potts and Madame de la Grande Bouche, an operatic wardrobe, attempt to cheer her up (\"Home (Reprise)\").\n\nBack in town, at the local tavern, Gaston sulks at his loss of a bride. LeFou and the patrons attempt to cheer him up (\"Gaston\"), when Maurice rushes in claiming a Beast has Belle locked away, they laugh at him but Gaston formulates a plan (\"Gaston (Reprise)\"). Back at the castle, the Beast grows impatient as Belle has yet to join him for dinner. Cogsworth informs him she refuses to come, after a shouting match between Belle and the Beast (which ends in a victory for Belle) he tells her if she cannot eat with him then she will not eat at all. In his quarters, he sulks and notes his fate should the spell not break (\"How Long Must This Go On?\"). Eventually, Belle does become hungry and ventures into the kitchen where the servants offer her dinner despite their master's orders. They treat her to an amazing cabaret show (\"Be Our Guest\").\n\nAfter dinner, Belle gets a tour of the castle courtesy of Cogsworth and Lumière, her curiosity leads her to enter the West Wing, a place the Beast told her was forbidden. Mesmerized by a mysterious rose floating in a bell jar, she reaches out to touch it but before she can, the Beast stops her and orders her to get out accidentally shoving her in the process. Fearing for her life, Belle flees from the castle. Realizing his deadly mistake, the Beast knows he will be a monster forever if he cannot learn to love her (\"If I Can't Love Her\").\n\nIn the woods, Belle is attacked by wolves and is only rescued when the Beast comes to her aid, but he is injured during the fight and collapses (\"Entr'acte/Wolf Chase\"). Instead of taking the chance to run home Belle helps him back to the castle. She cleans his injuries and after a brief argument about whose fault this is, the Beast thanks her for her kindness and thus their friendship is born. Wanting to give her a thank-you gift, the Beast gives Belle his huge library, which excites her. She notes a change in the Beast's personality as the servants note a change in Belle and the Beast's relationship (\"Something There\"). They express their hope of being human once more (\"Human Again\") while Belle asks the Beast to accompany her to dinner that night.\n\nBack in the village, Gaston and LeFou meet with the asylum owner Monsieur D'Arque. They plan to lock Maurice away to blackmail Belle into marrying Gaston (\"Maison des Lunes\"). In the castle, the Beast and Belle attend a lovely dinner and personal ball, where they dance together in the ballroom (\"Beauty and the Beast\"). The Beast, who plans to tell Belle he loves her, asks Belle if she is happy here, to which she responds positively but notes that she misses her father. He offers her his Magic Mirror to view him. She sees that Maurice is sick and lost in the woods and fears for his life. But even though the Beast knows there are only a few hours left till the last petal falls from the rose, he allows Belle to leave in order to save her father; she departs after a tearful goodbye (\"If I Can't Love Her (Reprise)\").\n\nBelle finds her father and brings him back to their house in the village. After she is able to nurse him back to health, she explains the transformation she seems to have gone through while she was with the Beast (\"A Change in Me\"). A mob arrives, led by Gaston to take Maurice to the asylum. Belle proves her father's sanity by showing the townspeople the Beast is real using the Magic Mirror, but does not realize the error in her gesture. The townspeople immediately fear the Beast, but Belle insists that he is gentle and kind. Gaston catches her tone and recognizes the Beast as his rival for Belle's affections and organizes the mob to kill the Beast (\"Mob Song\"). In order to warn the Beast, Belle and Maurice decide to beat the mob to the castle. However, Gaston and the mob had already reached the castle before Belle and Maurice did.\n\nAt the castle, the servants are able to keep the lynch mob at bay, but Gaston breaks through and finds the Beast in his tower. He engages in a fight with him, mercilessly beating and taunting him (\"Battle\"). The Beast has lost the will to live at Belle's departure. As Gaston moves in for the killing blow, Belle arrives. The Beast immediately turns on Gaston and is prepared to kill him, but spares his life after seeing the fear in his eyes. The Beast and Belle are reunited, but this reunion is cut short as Gaston fatally stabs the Beast. This act of violence causes Gaston to lose his footing and he falls to his death.\n\nOn the balcony, Belle assures the Beast he'll live but they both know she is helpless to save him. She begs him not to leave her because she has found home in his company (\"End Duet\"), but despite this, he dies; Belle sobs on his body and says she loves him just before the last rose petal falls. A transformation takes place (\"Transformation\") and the Beast is alive and human once more. Though Belle does not recognize him for the first time, she looks into his eyes and sees the Beast within and they kiss. The two of them sing of how their lives have changed because of love and they dance once more as the company, now changed back to their human form, gathers in the ballroom (\"Beauty and the Beast (Reprise)\").\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast\" premiered in a joint production of Theatre Under The Stars and Disney Theatrical at the Music Hall, Houston, Texas, from November 28, 1993, through December 26, 1993.\n\nThe musical opened on Broadway at the Palace Theatre on April 18, 1994, and ran there until September 5, 1999. The show then transferred to the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on November 11, 1999, with an official opening date of November 16, 1999. The musical closed on July 29, 2007, after 46 previews and 5,461 performances, and is Broadway's tenth-longest running production in history (). The production holds the record of being the longest running production at both the Palace Theatre, where it opened, and the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, where it closed its Broadway run. The production cost an estimated $12 million, arguably higher, becoming the most costly Broadway musical at the time. However, some analysists estimate the cost to be closer to $1.6 billion.\n\nDirected by Robert Jess Roth with choreography by Matt West and assisted by Dan Mojica, the original Broadway cast included Susan Egan as Belle, Terrence Mann as the Beast, Burke Moses as Gaston, Gary Beach as Lumière and Beth Fowler as Mrs. Potts. Orchestrations were by Danny Troob (after his own orchestrations and arrangements of the film), scenic designer was Stan Meyer, costume designer Ann Hould-Ward, lighting designer Natasha Katz, sound was by T. Richard Fitzgerald, hair designer David H. Lawrence, and prosthetics were by John Dods. Illusions were by Jim Steinmeyer and John Gaughan, and pyrotechnic design was by Tyler Wymer.\n\nThe Broadway production closed to make way for Disney's next musical venture, \"The Little Mermaid\". With Disney set to open its Broadway version of \"The Little Mermaid\" on November 3, 2007, at the time, it was believed that having two Disney princess films on Broadway at the same time would divide audiences and cause competition between the two shows. At this point, Disney also had three other shows running at the same time: \"The Lion King\", \"Tarzan\", and \"Mary Poppins\". It was reported that Disney Theatrical planned to revive the show on Broadway for the 2008 holiday season, but Disney did not pursue this.\n\nThe West End production opened at London's Dominion Theatre on April 29, 1997, starring Julie-Alanah Brighten as Belle and Alasdair Harvey as the Beast. It also featured Burke Moses as Gaston, Derek Griffiths as Lumiere, Mary Millar as Mrs. Potts, Norman Rossington as Maurice, Barry James as Cogsworth, Di Botcher as Madame de la Grande Bouche, Richard Gauntlett as LeFou, and Rebecca Thornhill as Babette.\n\nOver the course of the production, notable replacements included Michelle Gayle and Annalene Beechey as Belle, John Barrowman and Earl Carpenter as the Beast, Alex Bourne as Gaston, and Billy Boyle and Terry Doyle as Maurice. The production ended on December 11, 1999.\n\nThe production won the 1998 American Express Award for Best New Musical Olivier Award, against other nominees \"Enter the Guardsman\", \"The Fix\" and \"Lady in the Dark\".\n\nThe show had four US national tours. The first opened on November 15, 1995, and closed in 1999. It featured Kim Huber as Belle, Fred Inkley as the Beast, Patrick Page as Lumiere and Paige Davis as Babette. Patrick Page and Paige Davis met and fell in love during the tour and married. A second national tour opened in 1999 with Susan Owen as Belle and Grant Norman as The Beast. This production closed in 2003. The third national tour opened in 2001 and closed in 2003. This production starred Jennifer Shraeder as Belle and Roger Befeler as the Beast with Marc G. Dalio as Gaston. Notable replacements on the tours have included Sarah Litzsinger, Erin Dilly and Danyelle Bossardet as Belle. The three touring companies visited 137 venues in 90 North American cities. About 5.5 million people in the United States and Canada saw these tours. The fourth national tour of \"Beauty and the Beast\" began February 2010, opening in Providence, Rhode Island, starring Liz Shivener as Belle and Justin Glaser as the Beast. Under the direction of the original Broadway creative team, the show featured all new sets and costumes. The tour was the longest in the show's history, running until July 2016.\n\nThe UK National tour (prior to the closure of the West End Production in 1999) began on November 2, 2001, at the Empire Theatre in Liverpool with stops in Bristol, Birmingham, Dublin, Southampton, Manchester and ended on April 12, 2003, at the Playhouse Theatre in Edinburgh. The tour starred Annalene Beechey (reprising her role from the London production) as Belle, Alistair Robins as the Beast, Ben Harlow as Gaston, Julia Goss as Mrs. Potts, Stephen Matthews as Lumiere Barry James (reprising his role from the London production) as Cogsworth, Billy Boyle (reprising his role from the London production) as Maurice, Karen Davies as Madame de la Grande Bouche, Kate Graham (reprising her role from the London production) as Babette, Anthony Clegg as LeFou, and Oliver Taylor (reprising his role from the London production) and Sion Eifion sharing the role of Chip. Notable replacements included Dianne Pilkington as Belle, Alex Bourne as the Beast, Earl Carpenter as Gaston, Marilyn Cutts as Mrs. Potts, Richard Tate as Maurice, and Drew Varley as LeFou.\n\nA Los Angeles production opened at the Shubert Theatre on April 12, 1995, and closed on September 29, 1996. Most of the original Broadway cast, including Susan Egan, Terrence Mann, Gary Beach, Beth Fowler, Burke Moses and Tom Bosley reprised their roles. Notable replacements included James Stacy Barbour as the Beast. The sets in this production were widely considered to be the largest out of all the musical's productions in the world. After the show closed in Los Angeles, all of the sets were transferred for the production in Mexico City in 1997.\n\nThe Toronto production opened at the Princess of Wales Theatre on July 25, 1995, and closed on August 30, 1997. The production starred Kerry Butler as Belle and Chuck Wagner as the Beast, and Terry Doyle as Maurice. Notable replacements included Melissa Thomson as Belle and Steve Blanchard as the Beast.\nThe lesser known Halifax production at the Neptune Theatre was the longest running production in the theatre's history.\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast\" has been performed in more than 30 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and United States. Over 35 million people have seen the show worldwide and it has grossed more than $1.7 billion.\n\nOn July 15, 1995, the musical began its original Australian run in Melbourne at the Princess Theatre, before moving on to Sydney. The original Australian cast included Michael Cormick as The Beast, Rachael Beck as Belle, Hugh Jackman as Gaston, and Ernie Bourne as Maurice.\n\nIn 1995, the musical opened in Japan and was performed by the Shiki Theatre Company. The musical continued to tour Japan until May 2017.\n\nIn December 1997, the musical opened in Stuttgart at the Palladium Theatre, Stuttgart and played there until December 22, 2000. Leah Delos Santos played Belle and Uwe Kröger played the Beast and Marc G. Dalio played Gaston.\n\nIn 1999, the musical opened in China.\n\nOn March 4, 2005, Beauty and the Beast had its Scandinavian premiere at The Göteborg Opera with Fred Johanson as the Beast and Annica Edstam as Belle.\n\nOn June 16, 2005, the musical began its Philippine run at the Meralco Theater. Produced by Atlantis Productions, it featured KC Concepcion alternating with Karel Marquez as Belle, Jett Pangan as the Beast, and Calvin Millado as Gaston.\n\nIn South America, Argentina was the first country to produce it, with Marisol Otero as Belle, Juan Rodó as Beast, Diego Jaraz as Gaston, Gustavo Monje as LeFou, Pablo Lizaso as Lumière, Mónica Nuñez as Mrs. Potts, Omar Pini as Cogsworth, Alejandra Radano as Babette and Rodolfo Valss as Maurice. It ran from November 26, 1998, at the Teatro Ópera in Buenos Aires until August 15, 1999, before opening again in 2010. Brazil was the second country to host the musical. Disney had plans to bring it to the country in 1999, after the success in Argentina, but nobody really knew if it would work. Three years later, in 2002, \"Beauty and the Beast\" finally opened in Brazil at Teatro Abril, one of the biggest theaters in the country. It was a huge hit, for more than one and a half years, it was presented with Kiara Sasso playing Belle and Saulo Vasconcelos playing the Beast. In 2009, a new Belle and a new Beast were cast, Lissah Martins and Ricardo Vieira, as the musical came back to Brazil, Kiara Sasso was playing Maria in \"The Sound of Music\". \"Beauty and the Beast\" remained for six months at Teatro Abril. Even though the play was brought back as a way to try to recoup some of the money lost in Brazil's version of \"Miss Saigon\", this second incarnation of \"Beauty and the Beast\" failed to create any critical buzz, or to be a box office success.\n\nIn Spain there have been three productions of the show. The first one, based on the original Broadway production, had its Madrid debut on December 2, 1999, at Teatro Lope de Vega. The original cast included Xenia Reguant (later replaced by Julia Möller) as Belle, Carlos Marín (later replaced by Joe Luciano) as Beast, Lisardo Guarinos (later replaced by Manuel Bandera) as Gaston, Víctor Ullate Roche as LeFou, Germán Torres as Lumière, Kirby Navarro as Mrs. Potts, David Venancio Muro as Cogsworth, Dulcinea Juárez as Babette, Laura Inclán as Madame de la Grande Bouche and Miguel de Grandy as Maurice. After a successful run of 27 months and about 900 performances, the production finally closed on March 3, 2002, becoming the longest-running musical ever in Madrid at that time. In 2007, a second version produced by Stage Entertainment premiered on October 3, at Teatro Coliseum, Madrid, for a limited run of six months, but the closing was postponed due to a successful season. The original cast included Julia Möller reprising her role as Belle (later replaced by María Adamuz), David Ordinas as Beast, Pablo Puyol as Gaston, Raúl Peña as LeFou, Armando Pita as Lumière, Angels Jiménez as Mrs. Potts (later replaced by Rita Barber), Esteban Oliver as Cogsworth, Silvia Luchetti as Babette, María José Oquendo as Madame de la Grande Bouche and Lorenzo Valverde as Maurice. The production closed on January 11, 2009, and was transferred to Barcelona, where it ran from February 26, 2009, to January 10, 2010, at BTM, with some changes in the cast, including Mercè Martínez as Mrs. Potts, Marta Capel as Babette, Patricia Paisal as Madame de la Grande Bouche and Albert Muntanyola as Maurice. In 2012, the Stage Entertainment version was relaunched as a touring production, beginning performances on September 6, at Teatro Calderón, Valladolid. The original cast of this third Spanish production included Talía del Val as Belle, Ignasi Vidal as Beast, Daniel Diges as Gaston, Raúl Peña as LeFou, Diego Rodríguez as Lumière, Mone as Mrs. Potts, Frank Capdet as Cogsworth, Marta Capel as Babette, Eva Diago as Madame de la Grande Bouche and Enrique R. del Portal as Maurice.\n\nIn 2005, Disney and Stage Entertainment produced a new version of the show using brand new sets and costumes. After touring the Netherlands and playing in Antwerp, Belgium, Disney and Stage Entertainment brought the show to Berlin, Germany, in 2006 after a (approx.) one-year run at the Metronom Theater in Oberhausen. This production opened in 2007 in Madrid, Spain, and in 2009 in Milan, Italy, with Arianna as Belle and Michel Altieri as the Beast. The Broadway production played a second time in Mexico City beginning in September 2007 and in Hiroshima, Japan, beginning in February 2008. The Broadway production opened in South Africa in September 2008 and ran until March 2009. In 2004, Disney began to license the show to other companies for touring, and the show has been performed by professional and amateur companies in many countries.\n\nOn October 24, 2013, \"Beauty and the Beast\" opened at Théâtre Mogador in Paris, France.\n\nBeginning October 2014, Disney Theatrical Productions, NETworks and Broadway Entertainment Group launched an international tour in celebration of \"Beauty and the Beast\"s 20th anniversary on stage. The tour opened at the Zorlu Center in Istanbul, Turkey, and closed in January 2016 at Dubai World Trade Centre, having visited Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Greece, Italy, Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, China, Taiwan, Egypt, Lebanon, Romania, and Qatar.\n\nIn December 2015, \"Beauty and the Beast\" came back to the Netherlands for a run at Circustheater in The Hague.\n\nIn 2016, Disney and Marmelade produced an updated version for the Flemish Region of Belgium. The original cast included Josje Huisman as Belle, Jan Schepens as Beast, Dieter Troubleyn as Gaston, Peter Van de Velde as Lumière, Frank Hoelen as Maurice, Ivan Pecnik as Cogsworth (called Tickens), Eline De Munck as Babette, Peter Thyssen as LeFou, Barbara Dex as Mrs. Potts and Saskia Schäfer as Madame de la Grande Bouche (called La Commodia). The show premiered on December 10, 2016, at Flanders Expo in Ghent.\n\nThe show's rights became available (in association with Josef Weinberger Ltd.) to amateur performing groups and regional musical societies. The show has been performed in numerous countries, by theatre companies on both an amateur and professional level.\n\nOn April 24, 2019 Disney Theatrical Groups revealed that \"Beauty and the Beast\" would return to Broadway. Thomas Schumacher announced that the Broadway revival would be updated, but there was no theatre or production timeline announced.\n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> New song or instrumental cue\n\n† Expanded vocal or instrumental content, using either cut lyrics by Ashman or dance arrangements by Glen Kelly, or both.\n\n‡ \"Human Again\" was written by Menken and Ashman for the movie, but was cut, due to the complications it made on the film's timeline. It was repurposed for the Broadway play, and on account of the musical's great success, an entirely new animated sequence based on the Broadway version was set to this song and inserted into 2002's Special Edition DVD release.\n\n§ \"A Change in Me\" was written into the show in 1998 for the debut of Toni Braxton and was retained thereafter.\n\n\"#\" not in the Junior Broadway show\n\nMusic Theatre International offers two orchestrations for \"Beauty and the Beast\".\n\nThe principal, larger orchestration is based on the original Broadway orchestration. It is scored for three synthesizers, a drum kit, a percussion section, double bass, three woodwind players, three French horns in F, two trumpets in B-flat, trombone, divided violins, cellos, and harp. The first woodwind player doubles on flute and piccolo, the second on English horn and oboe, and the third on clarinet, bass clarinet, and flute. The trombonist doubles on bass trombone and tuba.\n\nThe original Broadway orchestration featured two additional woodwind players. The first played flute and piccolo, the second oboe and English horn, the third piccolo, flute and clarinet in B-flat, the fourth piccolo, flute, clarinet in B-flat and bass clarinet in B-flat, and the fifth on bassoon and contrabassoon. The excised reed parts were used for the synthesizer parts upon their removal for the licensed orchestration.\n\nThe optional reduced orchestration is scored for two synthesizers, a percussion section, double bass, three woodwind players, a trumpet, a French horn, and solo violin and cello.\n\nNotable Broadway cast replacements (approximate dates given where available)\n\n\nThe Original Broadway Cast Recording was released on April 26, 1994. The CD included Susan Egan as Belle, Terrence Mann as Beast, Burke Moses as Gaston, Gary Beach as Lumière, Tom Bosley as Maurice, Anna McNeeley as Madame de la Grande Bouche and Beth Fowler as Mrs. Potts.\n\nThe Original Australian Cast Recording was released in 1995.

The principal cast included Julie-Alanah Brighten as Belle, Alasdair Harvey as Beast, Burke Moses as Gaston, Derek Griffiths as Lumière and Mary Millar as Mrs. Potts.\n\nThe Original Stuttgart Cast Recording was released in 1998. The principal cast included Uwe Kroger as Beast and Leah Delos Santos as Belle and Ann Mandrella as Babette.\n\nThe Original Madrid Cast Recording was released in 1999. The principal cast included Xenia Reguant as Belle, Carlos Marín as Beast, Lisardo Guarinos as Gaston, Víctor Ullate Roche as LeFou, Germán Torres as Lumière, David Venancio Muro as Cogsworth and Kirby Navarro as Mrs. Potts. A second cast recording for the new production was released in May 2008, starring Julia Möller as Belle, David Ordinas as Beast, Pablo Puyol as Gaston, Raúl Peña as LeFou, Armando Pita as Lumière, Esteban Oliver as Cogsworth and Angels Jiménez as Mrs. Potts.\n\nA \"junior\" version of the musical for middle and high school students was published by MTI. This version only included a selected number of the songs, including \"Belle\", \"Belle (Reprise)\", \"Home\", \"Home (Tag)\", \"Gaston\", \"Gaston (Reprise)\", \"Be Our Guest\", \"Something There\", \"Human Again\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"The Mob Song\", \"Home (Reprise)\", and \"Beauty and the Beast (Reprise)\". Also in \"Belle (Reprise)\", The Silly Girls take Belle's part in the beginning of the song instead of Belle having to sing the whole song. Also in \"Something There\", Madame de la Grande Bouche and Babette sing as well.\n\nReception towards the tryouts in Houston were so enthusiastic that the production was extended for two weeks. Jerome Weeks of \"Variety\" responded to the show with a positive review, praising the performances of Egan, Mann and Moses, as well as the Beast's new song \"If I Can't Love Her\". At the same time, Weeks felt that the production \"gets close to slipping into a big-budget kiddie show or magic act with its overdone showbiz glitz and sparkly stage-illusion effects\"at times, but in the end predicted that \"'Beauty and the Beast' could well be the big new musical hit this Broadway season has been waiting for.\" However, in 1994, \"Beauty and the Beast\" finally premiered on Broadway to reviews that ranged from mixed to negative, leaving critics mostly unimpressed. Reactions from the New York theatre community and Broadway producers were particularly harsh, ridiculing Disney for deciding to produce the musical themselves as opposed to enlisting traditional theatre companies. Egan recalled that \"the same five families [had] produced Broadway shows for a hundred years and Disney shook that up.\"\n\nNearly universally panned by theatre critics, they concurred that \"Beauty and the Beast\" was a \"great spectacle, but not great theater\". Likening the musical to the Empire State Building, David Richards of \"The New York Times\" called the show \"hardly a triumph of art, but it'll probably be a whale of a tourist attraction.\" While awarding specific praise towards its musical numbers, choreography, costumes and cast – particularly Mann's ability to \"convey the delicacy of awakening love\" despite the physical demands of his costume, at the same time Richards criticized the production's set and special effects for lacking subtlety, ultimately accusing them of leaving little \"to the imagination\". Richards concluded, \"The result is a sightseer's delight, which isn't the same thing as a theatergoer's dream.\" Also writing for \"The New York Times\", Vincent Canby disparaged the musical entirely as \"relentlessly bland, busy, upbeat and robotlike\", criticizing the production for resembling \"a dinner theater.\" Canby felt that the new Menken-Rice songs were \"inferior\" to the originals, likened the special effects to Fourth of July sparklers, criticized the sound engineering for ranging from too loud to barely audible, and panning Woolverton's book for failing to supplement her screenplay. Minor praise was awarded to the performances of Lamberts, Beach and Fowler, as well as Mann's climactic beast-to-prince transformation. In addition to predicting that \"Beauty and the Beast\" would be derided by traditional Broadway theatre-goers and critics alike, \"Variety\" writer Jeremy Gerard was largely negative in his own review. While admitting that the production \"boasts several real pluses\", Gerard criticized the show for appearing \"bloated, padded, gimmick-ridden, tacky and ... utterly devoid of imagination.\" The critic voiced his strong disapproval of the costumes while dismissing the set as \"something designed to be seen by people in moving seats, maybe at Disneyland\", panning West's choreography and ultimately deriding Roth's directing and blocking of actors who \"look generally like they're following dotted lines on the stage.\" Critics agreed that Roth's direction and West's were equally uninspired. In a mixed review with a headline reading \"\"Beauty and the Beast\" isn't magical in the least, even if it does bristle with magic tricks\", \"New York\"s John Simon wrote that the production resembles \"a belated infomercial\" for the film by which he was bored, yet impressed by its special effects and illusions. Simon also felt that the actors struggled to resemble their animated counterparts despite Hould-Ward's, criticizing Egan's acting, Woolverton's dialogue and the new Menken-Rice numbers while praising Moses', Beach's and Fowler's performances.\n\nAudiences did not share critics' negative opinions, and the musical famously resonated with the public and families. Children were especially delighted by the idea of their favorite movie performed on stage by live actors. Subsequent productions have gradually attracted kinder remarks; the national tours in particular have been well received. Reviewing a performance of the musical at the Shubert Theatre in Los Angeles in 1995, Tom Jacobs of \"Variety\" wrote, \"Born in Hollywood as an animated film, Disney's version of 'Beauty and the Beast' has returned home as an opulent stage musical, a year after its Broadway bow. Both good and bad choices have been made in adapting the 1991 film, but with its outstanding performances, fantastic production values and memorable score, this show should warm the hearts of all but the most curmudgeonly theatergoers.\" However, Jacobs felt that the production suffered from the lack of danger felt watching the film. After having been left unimpressed upon viewing the original Broadway production, \"Variety\"s Matt Wolf was pleasantly surprised by the musical's West End debut one year later.\n\n\"Be Our Guest\" was used as the commercial for the 1994 Tony Awards. Michael Goldstein of \"New York\" correctly predicted that Mann would earn a Tony Award nomination for his performance. Despite having been nominated for a total of nine individual awards, \"Beauty and the Beast\" was ultimately shunned at the ceremony, winning only one award – Best Costume Design – for Hould-Ward. Nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical, the production famously lost to Stephen Sondheim's \"Passion\", which is considered to be his own version of the \"Beauty and the Beast\" fairy tale. In 1995, some of Hould-Ward's costumes, namely Lumiere, were put on display in Nordstrom stores. Meanwhile, Belle and the Beast's ballroom costumes were exhibited at Westside Pavilion, and Mrs. Potts and LeFou appeared at South Coast Plaza.\n\nLargely due to audience reception, \"Beauty and the Beast\" remains one of Broadway's biggest successes of the current era. \"Beauty and the Beast\" established itself as a musical that could survive on Broadway despite its unenthusiastic reviews. Several detractors had thought that musicals like \"Beauty and the Beast\" would be a one-time event, but the results ultimately turned out to be quite the opposite. According to theatrical producer Stuart Oken, Disney's success with \"Beauty and the Beast\" is responsible for today's biggest Broadway hits and making the medium \"better than it has ever been\". The groundbreaking performance of \"Beauty and the Beast\" inspired other major Hollywood studios to produce Broadway renditions of some of their own films. Disney soon began to commission Broadway adaptations of several of the studio's most popular musical films, namely \"The Lion King\" (1997), \"Mary Poppins\" (2004), \"Tarzan\" (2006), \"The Little Mermaid\" (2008), \"Newsies\" (2012) and \"Aladdin\" (2014), in addition to producing the musical \"Aida\". After completing her run in \"Beauty and the Beast\", Egan would famously go on to voice Meg in Disney's animated musical \"Hercules\" (1997), establishing herself as a popular voice and film actress. Following the success of \"Human Again\", the song was later incorporated into reissues of the animated film in the form of an animated musical sequence.\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast\" is considered to be Broadway's first legitimate family show, responsible for birthing an entirely new generation of young theatregoers. The family demographic of the musical established inspired international productions of \"Aladdin\" and \"Matilda\". According to \"The Complete Book of 1990s Broadway Musicals\" author Dan Dietz, \"the show's resounding success opened the floodgates for a spate of ... productions based on Disney and other family-oriented films\", transforming Broadway into \"a theme park with a parade of musicals aimed at kids and teenagers.\" Dietz believes that the plethora of Broadway musicals that came after \"Beauty and the Beast\" have unfortunately resembled \"feel-good family show[s] whose goal was to emulate its film source.\" Additionally, the success of the musical inspired a legion of Broadway productions geared towards young women, including \"Hairspray\" (2002), \"Wicked\" (2003), \"Legally Blonde\" (2007), \"Matilda\" (2013) and Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Cinderella\" (2013). While these musicals flourished on Broadway, it seems as though more serious, adult-oriented fare struggled to perform as well. New York theatre critic Howard Kissel famously despised \"the Kiddy Komponent of New York theatergoing\" spearheaded by the successful 13-year Broadway run of \"Beauty and the Beast\". The success of \"Beauty and the Beast\" inspired Eisner to invest in his own theatre to house future stage adaptations of the studio's animated classics.\n\n\n"}

The operation to insert the tube involves a myringotomy and is performed under local or general anesthesia. The tube itself is made in a variety of designs. The most commonly used type is shaped like a grommet. When it is necessary to keep the middle ear ventilated for a very long period, a \"T\"-shaped tube may be used, as these \"T-tubes\" can stay in place for 2–4 years. Materials used to construct the tube are most often plastics such as silicone or Teflon. Stainless steel tubes exist, but are no longer in frequent use.\n\nInserting grommets is a common surgical procedure for treating children around the world. Grommets are most commonly used to help improve hearing for children who have a condition commonly called \"glue ear\" (persistent otitis media with effusion) in both ears, and for preventing ear infections in children who have frequent middle ear infections. Grommets are temporary and often fall out after 12–14 months as the ear heals. \nGuidelines state that tubes are an option in:\n\nEar discharge (otorrhoea) is common in 25–75% of children after grommets are inserted. Treatments to prevent this discharge before it occurs should be limited to children who have a higher risk of otorrhoea and it is not clear which preventative treatment is better.\n\nThe risk of having persistent tympanic membrane perforation following the procedure may be low, and has been estimated at 2%. Other adverse effects are estimated at: blockage of the tympanostomy tube (7%), formation of granulation tissue (4%), grommet falls out too early (4%), and the tympanostomy tube may move towards the middle ear (0.5%). There is also a risk related to general anesthesia.\n\nLong term effects include visible changes to the tympanic membrane. These changes usually resolve on their own and do not usually require medical treatment or result in hearing problems that are clinically significant.\n\nGrommets work by improving drainage in the ear and allow air to circulate in the ear. Grommet placement has been shown to improve hearing in children with glue ear and may lead to fewer middle ear infections in children who have regular episodes of acute otitis media. Grommets can be used to apply antibiotics drops in children with persistent middle ear infections.\n\nAlthough myringotomy with tube insertion can be performed under local anesthesia during a regular doctor's appointment in co-operative adults, patients requiring tube insertion are very often young children. Since damage to the ear is possible unless the patient stays quite still while being manipulated, any patient who may have difficulty lying still during the procedure typically undergoes myringotomy and tube insertion under general anesthesia.\n\nThe insertion of tympanostomy tubes is one of the most common surgical procedures performed on children. In the United States, the procedure accounts for more than 20% of all ambulatory surgery in children under 15 years.\n\nFor children with ear discharge, antibiotic ear drops may be more effective than antibiotics taken by mouth. It is not clear if antibiotic drops are better than rinsing the ear with saline.\n\nIt is usually suggested that children keep their ears dry for the first two weeks after having the procedure. It is not thought to be necessary for children to wear ear plugs when swimming or keep their ears dry after the first two weeks as the potential benefit is very small. It is approximated that a child would need to wear ear plugs for 2.8 years to prevent one additional ear infection.\n\nTympanostomy tubes generally remain in the eardrum for six months to two years, with T-tubes lasting up to four years. They generally spontaneously fall out of the eardrum as the skin of the eardrum slowly migrates out towards the ear canal wall over time. The eardrum usually closes without a residual hole at the tube site but in a small number of cases a perforation can persist. There is debate among clinicians as to whether long-lasting tubes are associated with a higher incidence of adverse outcomes, such as persistent perforation, cholesteatoma, tympanosclerosis and others, as opposed to tubes designed to last for shorter durations.\n"}

Like Sodom before him, he first appeared as a boss character in \"Final Fight\", but later evolved into a playable fighter in \"Street Fighter Alpha 2\".\n\nRolento made his debut appearance as the fourth stage's boss in the original \"Final Fight\". He is a former member of the fictional Red Beret special forces unit and serves as the supervisor of the Mad Gear gang's weapons plant. When defeated, instead of just fading away while lying on the ground like most enemies in the game, he stands up and blows himself up with his own grenades, fading away completely scorched. Rolento and his \"Industrial Area\" stage were not included in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System port of \"Final Fight\", nor in its re-release \"Final Fight Guy\", but were included in other ports of the game, such as the Sega CD and Game Boy Advance versions (if the player confronts Rolento as \"Alpha Cody\" in the GBA version, Cody will joke about Rolento's omission in the SNES version). In the SNES-exclusive sequel \"Final Fight 2\", Rolento serves as the boss of the fifth stage, Italy (his name is transliterated as \"Rolent\" both in the game and in the instruction booklet).\n\nHis debut as a playable fighter was in the fighting game \"Street Fighter Alpha 2\" in 1996, in which he seeks to build a military utopia following the downfall of the Mad Gear gang and wants to recruit his former ally and nemesis, Sodom and Guy respectively, to his cause. Rolento's ending in \"Alpha 2\" depicts him invading the streets of Metro City after forming his own army. In \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\", Rolento tries to persuade Cody, another former nemesis, to join his army. In his ending, Rolento attempts to infiltrate Shadaloo's underground base to gain M. Bison's secret weapon, the Psycho Drive, only to destroy it with Sodom's help. His \"Alpha\" series' incarnation also appears as a playable character in the 2002 crossover fighting game \"Capcom vs. SNK 2\", as well as in the 1999 fighting game \"Final Fight Revenge\" which follows his backstory from the \"Alpha\" series.\n\nRolento returns as a playable character in the 2012 crossover fighting game \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", where his official tag partner is the ninja girl Ibuki. In 2013, he was announced to appear as a playable character in \"Ultra Street Fighter IV\".\n\nRolento made his first appearance outside the \"Final Fight\" series in the original \"\", where he makes a cameo in Sodom's ending among other former Mad Gear members gathered by Sodom to help rebuild the gang. Although he does not appear in \"Street Fighter EX\", Rolento also plays a role in Doctrine Dark's backstory in this game, as the one responsible for physically crippling him and causing his psychotic breakdown.\n\nHe also makes a cameo appearance in \"Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix\", is available in the \"\" series, and appears in \"Capcom World 2\". Outside of video games, Rolento appears in the \"Street Fighter\" animated series, in the anime OAV miniseries \"\", in the \"Street Fighter\" comic book \"Street Fighter II Turbo\", and in the manga \"Sakura Ganbaru\". In 2012, Rolento returned to boss role in the platform game \"Street Fighter X Mega Man\", as an enemy of Mega Man.\n\nRolento was created by Neo_G (Ishizawa Hidetoshi) and his name was supposed to be \"Laurence\" (arguably \"Laurent\") in the concept stages, but due to the confusion between \"l\" and \"r\" and additions of vowels at the end of words in transliteration, \"Laurence\" became \"Rolento\". In \"Street Fighter\", Rolento wears a militant outfit with weapon belts (where he keeps his grenades) going over his shoulders and a red beret on his head. He has a red scarf under his worn yellow military outfit and fights with a stick. This is a change from how he originally appeared in \"Final Fight\", in which he wore a Tiger Stripes colour scheme uniform and wielded a brown club. \"Tekken\" character Nina Williams received a Rolento-style alternate costume in an update for \"Street Fighter X Tekken\".\n\nIn \"Final Fight\", he fights using a rod and resorts to throwing grenades when he is low on energy. Rolento's fighting style in the \"Street Fighter\" games is based broadly on his \"Final Fight\" counterpart. He uses his stick and grenades from \"Final Fight\", as well as throwing knives and wires. One of Rolento's super combos in the \"Alpha\" series, \"Take No Prisoners\", involves his opponent being hooked to the ceiling by either El Gado or Holly Wood, enemy characters from \"Final Fight\" who appear to be working for Rolento during the \"Alpha\" series.\n\nIGN's review of \"Street Fighter Alpha 2\" praised Capcom's designs for the new characters, amongst them Rolento, but in a preview of \"Capcom vs. SNK 2\", IGN's David Smith wrote that \"Rolento is strong…but he's just no fun to watch.\" Askmen.com nominated Rolento as one of the five characters they wanted to be included in \"Street Fighter IV\". In 2010, Rolento was ranked as 34th-best \"Street Fighter\" character by UGO Networks, who noted that his finishers (Ultra Combos) are some of the more impressive in the series and that he was rumored to appear in \"Super Street Fighter IV\". That same year, European \"Street Fighter\" champion Ryan Hart ranked Rolento as the tenth-best \"Street Fighter\" character in a list compiled for \"The Guardian\". Rolento is, however, rarely voted for in the official polls for the best \"Street Fighter\" characters according to \"Street Fighter\" fans. He also featured on UGO's list of most memorable Italians in video games, placing 13th. His \"In my ideal nation, there would exist no one as weak as you!\" from \"Alpha 3\" was included on the list of the most humiliating video game victory quotes by \"Complex\" in 2012.\n\n"}

Texas Republican Congressman Lamar S. Smith introduced the Act on 8 June 2005. Smith called the Act \"the most comprehensive change to U.S. patent law since Congress passed the 1952 Patent Act.\" The Act proposed many of the recommendations made by a 2003 report by the Federal Trade Commission and a 2004 report by the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe 109th Congress concluded on January 3, 2007 without enacting H.R. 2795. Much of the proposed Act was carried into the proposed Patent Reform Act of 2007 (, ), which was introduced in the 110th Congress on 18 April 2007. A similar act was introduced as the Patent Reform Act of 2009 in the 111th Congress.\n\nH.R. 2795 would have harmonized American patent law with the patent laws of the rest of the world by making the following changes in U.S. patent law:\n\nThe United States is currently the only country in the world that gives priority to the application that claims the earliest invention date, regardless of which application arrives first. The first-to-invent system is thought to benefit small inventors, who may be less experienced with the patent application system. Critics of the first-to-file system also contend it will create a \"race to the mailbox,\" and result in sloppier, last-minute patent applications. The first-to-invent system, however, requires the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to undertake lengthy and complicated \"interference\" proceedings to try to determine who invented something first when claims conflict. The first-to-file system, supporters contend, would inject much-needed certainty into the patent application process. Finally, because every other country is on a first-to-file system, supporters claim that the majority of patent applicants and attorneys are already operating on a first-to-file basis.\n\nA first-to-file priority rule does not permit one individual to copy another's invention and then, by virtue of being the first to file a patent application, be entitled to a patent. All patent applicants must have originated the invention themselves, rather than derived it from another person. In order to police this requirement, the proposed H.R. 2795 provided for \"inventor's rights contests\" that would have allowed the USPTO to determine which applicant is entitled to a patent on a particular invention.\n\nEven under a first-to-invent system, the first-inventor-in-fact does not always obtain entitlement to a patent. If, for example, a first-inventor-in-fact maintained his invention as a trade secret for many years before seeking patent protection, he may be judged to have \"abandoned, suppressed or concealed\" the invention. Well-established patent law provides that an inventor who makes a secret, commercial use of an invention for more than one year prior to filing a patent application at the USPTO forfeits his own right to a patent. If an earlier inventor made secret commercial use of an invention, and another person independently invented the same technology later and obtained patent protection, then the trade secret holder could face liability for patent infringement. Many foreign patent regimes, on the other hand, protect prior user rights, which are often seen as assisting small entities that may lack the sophistication or resources to pursue patent protection. The American Inventors Protection Act of 1999 established a \"first inventor defense,\" but limited the defense to patents on \"methods of doing or conducting business;\" H.R. 2795 would have extended it to all subject matter.\n\nOutside the United States, pending patent applications are published 18 months after they are filed, which forewarns competitors that a patent is pending. Prior to 2000, American patent applications were never published. The American Inventors Protection Act allowed pre-grant publication 18 months after filing unless the inventor certified that he would not be seeking patent protection abroad. H.R. 2795 would have closed this loophole.\n\nHistorically, interested individuals could enter a \"protest\" against a pending patent application. Critics contended that protests serve mainly to permit third parties to slow down the process for competitors. On the other hand, protests are the only way for third parties to challenge a patent prior to approval, when recourse is only available through the court system. The American Inventors Protection Act severely limited protests, but H.R. 2795 would have eliminated those limitations.\n\nSince 1981, the U.S. patent system has incorporated \"reexamination\" proceedings, during which third parties can submit information challenging the validity of a patent. In order to discourage abuse of these proceedings, third-party participants may not later assert that a patent is invalid \"on any ground that [they] raised or \"could have raised\" during the inter partes reexamination proceedings.\" Some observers believe that this estoppel dissuades potential requesters from use of reexamination, forcing them into federal court. H.R. 2795 would have deleted the phrase \"or could have raised\" from the statute, so that reexamination requesters would be limited only with respect to arguments that they actually made before the USPTO.\n\nH.R. 2795 would have also established post-grant opposition proceedings, a feature that is common in foreign patent regimes. Oppositions allow a wide range of potential invalidity arguments and are conducted through adversarial hearings that resemble courtroom litigation, but because they limit discovery and involve a lower burden of proof, oppositions are cheaper and faster than lawsuits.\n\nPatent applications are currently required to \"set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.\" This requirement is unique to American patent law, and was identified in the 2004 National Academy of Sciences report as one of the three subjective elements that contribute to high patent litigation costs. H.R. 2795 would have eliminated it.\n\nIn patent infringement cases, treble damages are currently available if the court finds the infringement was \"willful.\" This is the second subjective factor that has been identified as increasing the length and cost of patent infringement suits. To avoid an allegation of willful infringement, many inventors purposely ignore learning about new patents, which contravenes one of the central purposes of the patent system, the dissemination of scientific knowledge. H.R. 2795 would have limited treble damages to cases in which the plaintiff notified the defendant of the patent, claims and violation, and permit pleading willful infringement only after a court finds that the patent was valid, enforceable, and infringed. \nDefendants in infringement suits are currently allowed to allege that the patent is unenforceable because the patent holder did not operate honestly and in good faith when it applied for a patent. This is the third subjective factor that has been identified as increasing the length and cost of infringement suits. H.R. 2795 would have eliminated this defense, instead codifying a duty of candor for all parties in proceedings before the USPTO, and providing authority for the PTO to investigate allegations of inequitable conduct and impose civil penalties.\n\nMost foreign countries already allow patent applications to be submitted by an assignee as long as the oath of invention is signed. H.R. 2795 would have adopted a similar rule in the United States.\n\nInjunctions are currently awarded in patent infringement cases if the plaintiff satisfies a four-part test. A plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies are not available at law; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserviced by a permanent injunction. H.R. 2795, as originally introduced, would have required a court to consider the \"fairness\" of an injunction in light of all the facts and the relevant interests of the parties, and allow an injunction to be stayed pending appeal upon an affirmative showing that the stay would not result in irreparable harm to the owner.\n\nThis is among the most controversial issues in patent reform. Software and information technology companies generally support limiting injunctions, because their products often involve hundreds or thousands of patents, and a dispute over any of them can result in an injunction that halts production on the entire item. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, on the other hand, generally oppose limiting injunctions, because the items they manufacture are easily analyzed and reproduced and generally involve only one or two patents.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2015361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015361", "title": "Mazeppa (opera)", "text": "Mazeppa (opera)\n\nMazeppa, properly Mazepa (), is an opera in three acts (six scenes) by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The libretto was written by Victor Burenin and is based on Pushkin's poem \"Poltava\", part of the cultural legacy of Mazeppa.\n\n\"Mazeppa\" is a blood-thirsty tale of crazy love, abduction, political persecution, execution, and vengeful murder. The action takes place in Ukraine at the beginning of the 18th century. The protagonists are the historical figures Ivan Stepanovych Mazeppa (c. 1640–1709), the Hetman of the Ukrainian Cossacks, and Vasyl Leontiyovych Kochubey (c.1640–1708), a very prosperous Ukrainian nobleman and statesman.\n\nThe opera was composed between June 1881 and April 1883. \"Mazeppa\"'s libretto was based on \"Poltava\", a narrative poem by Alexander Pushkin. Pushkin based his story on historical events at Poltava, the battle where Tsar Peter the Great defeated Swedish King Charles XII. Pushkin took some creative freedom in order to create powerful characters and grand passions. For example, Kochubey (the wealthy Cossack whose daughter elopes with Mazeppa) actually managed to successfully keep Mariya from him. He turned Mazeppa in to the Tsar four years after Mazeppa asked for her hand.\n\nTchaikovsky first mentioned the idea of an opera based on \"Poltava\" to his publisher in the summer of 1881. Soon, he became obsessed with Poltava's story of tragic love and political betrayal and quickly produced four numbers plus sketching a duet based on material from his symphonic poem \"Romeo and Juliet\" (this music later became Mazeppa and Mariya's Act 2 duet). Librettist Burenin followed Pushkin's poem, incorporating large excerpts from Poltava into his libretto, but Tchaikovsky was not very pleased with Burenin's work: he felt \"no special enthusiasm for the characters\", and went on to make some critical changes of his own, adding more of Pushkin's lines back in. Vasily Kandaurov contributed the text for Mazeppa's aria in Act 2, Scene 2.\n\nThe libretto was revised over and over again, even after the opera's premieres. Choosing to focus primarily on the love story at the heart of the opera, the composer added the character Andrei, a lovesick boy whose unrequited love for the beautiful Mariya gives her tragic fate a special poignancy. Mazeppa shares many characteristics with Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin: they both center on a young woman whose powerful love draws her into a catastrophic downward spiral.\n\nThe premiere performance took place on 15 February [OS February 3] 1884 at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow conducted by Ippolit Al'tani with stage Direction by Anton Bartsal, set design by Matvey Shishkov and Mikhail Bocharov, and Lev Ivanov as \"Balletmeister\".\n\nFour days later, on 19 February [OS February 7], the St. Petersburg premiere followed at the Mariinsky Theatre conducted by Eduard Nápravník.\n\nAt both performances, the work was brilliantly staged but marred by the uneven vocal and acting abilities of the cast. But audiences responded warmly and the critical notices, in Moscow at least, were kind. Tchaikovsky's brother, Modest, hid the truth about the critical roasting the opera got in St. Petersburg; when he finally learned the truth, Tchaikovsky wrote to thank him: \"You did well, the truth might have killed me.\"\n\nSource: Tchaikovsky Research\n\n\"Time\": Beginning of the 18th century\n\n\"Place\": Ukraine\n\n\"Overture: Mazeppa's ride\"\n\n\"Scene 1: Kochubey's estate on the banks of the Dniepr\"\n\nA group of peasant girls sail on the river, singing of making garlands of flowers to cast on the river and so divine their husband as a fortune-telling game. Mariya arrives, and they all plead with her to join them, but there is company at her house: The Hetman Mazeppa, and so she cannot stay with them. After they leave, she reveals that games have no temptation for her anymore, for she is in love with Mazeppa. Her childhood friend, Andrei, overhears her, and tries to comfort her, but when she thanks him for his kind friendship, he reveals he always loved her. She wishes it could be different, that she could love him too – but fate will not allow it. Andrei rushes off in despair. Mariya's father and mother, Vasily and Lyubov Kochubey arrive with the guests, and dance and song are provided for Mazeppa's entertainment, including the famous Hopak.\n\nThen Mazeppa draws Kochubey aside, and asks for his daughter's hand. Kochubey thinks he's joking at first – he is, after all, very old. Mazeppa claims that the passions of an old heart, once lit, are not like those of a young heart that burn brightly but then fade – they smoulder forever. Kochubey points out, however, that Mazeppa is Mariya's godfather, which is considered closer than a blood tie in the Russian Orthodox Church. Mazeppa replies that he can easily apply to the church for an exemption. Kochubey orders Mazeppa to leave. Mazeppa replies that he has already asked Mariya's hand, and been accepted, with a slight hint that he may already have had his way with Mariya. Kochubey still refuses, and Mazeppa calls in his guard. Mazeppa demands submission, everyone else curses his immoral desires and rise up against him, but just as battle is about to break out, Mariya throws herself between the two groups. As he leaves, Mazeppa calls for Mariya to decide whether she wishes to stay at home and never see him again, or to come with him. She chooses him to everyone's surprise and distress.\n\n\"Scene 2: A room in Kochubey's manor\"\n\nLyubov mourns Mariya's loss, the women of the house trying to comfort her, to no avail. She sends them away and tries to stir Kochubey to rouse the Cossacks to war and go to attack Mazeppa – but he has a better plan: Whilst the two were still friends, Mazeppa hinted at a plan to ally with Sweden and fight to free Ukraine from Peter the Great's rule. Iskra, Kochubey's friend, is all for it, but they need a messenger. Andrei, who feels his life is over after having lost Mariya, agrees to deliver it. Everyone curses Mazeppa and relishes the thought of his execution.\n\n\"Scene 1: A dungeon in Mazeppa's castle, night.\"\n\nThe plan has not gone well. Peter the Great sided with Mazeppa, and turned Kochubey over to him, sending, as Kochubey puts it, a loyal servant into the hand of a treasonous one. Under torture, Kochubey has made a false confession. Kochubey is trying to make himself right with God, and thinks he hears the priest coming to hear his last confession – but instead, it turns out to be Orlik, Mazeppa's henchman and torturer. Kochubey asks what more he could want – he had agreed under torture to everything that had been asked of him. But he hadn't revealed the location of his hidden treasures. He tells them to send Mariya, who will show them everything, and let him pray before his execution: he has already lost his treasures – His honour to a false confession extracted under torture, Mariya's honour to Mazeppa, and now has only the prospect of God's Vengeance after his death. This is not enough for Orlik – the tortures recommence.\n\n\"Scene 2: A terrace of Mazeppa's castle. The same night\"\n\nMazeppa ponders the terrible blow that will befall Mariya when she learns what he has done to her father – He has to be strong whilst he's trying to consolidate his power, but Mariya... Orlik arrives. Kochubey has revealed nothing about his treasure as yet. The execution is set for dawn, and Orlik is sent off to resume what needs to be done. Mazeppa ponders Mariya and the night.\n\nMariya arrives, and flirts with him, but her thoughts turn darker – why is he spending so much time away from her of late? Why did he toast Poltava the other night? Who is she? She gave up everything for him – if he rejected her now... Mazeppa tries to calm her, unsuccessfully at first, but eventually succeeds. He reveals his plan to gain independence for Ukraine, making himself King and Mariya queen. Mariya thinks the crown would suit him very well. He then begins testing her out about her father – who does she care for more – her husband or her family? Eventually Mariya says she would give up – indeed, has given up, everything for him. Mazeppa leaves, reassured.\n\nLyubov arrives, and pleads with Mariya to go to Mazeppa to save Kochubey – only she can save him. Mariya, not knowing anything about it, takes some time to figure out what was going on, but then is horrified and faints, unable to bear it. Lyubov shakes her awake – the procession is already leaving. The two run off in an attempt to plead with Mazeppa for Kochubey's life.\n\n\"Scene 3: By the town ramparts\"\n\nThe poor of the city have gathered for the execution, but their grim fears for Kochubey and hatred of Mazeppa are interrupted by a drunken Cossack singing a cheery little folk song. Mazeppa and Orlik arrive, Kochubey and Iskra are dragged on as prisoners and pray to God to forgive them. They are dragged to the stocks – the crowd gathers round – The axes are raised. Mariya and Lyubov arrive – just in time to see the axes fall. Lyubov rejects Mariya, who collapses in tears as the grim final chords of the chorus echo over the stage. Curtain.\n\n\"Orchestral Interlude: The Battle of Poltava: Peter the Great's defeat of Mazeppa and Charles XII of Sweden\"\n\n\"Scene 1: The ruins of Kochubey's estate, near the battlefield\"\n\nAndrei has fought in the Battle of Poltava, but was unable to find Mazeppa. He wanders around the ruins of the estate, remembering happier times. Horsemen approach and he hides.\n\nMazeppa and Orlik are fleeing the battle, Mazeppa brooding over having once been powerful, but now, in one day, having lost everything. He sends Orlik off to prepare camp. Andrei springs out and challenges Mazeppa with his sword. Mazeppa warns Andrei he is armed. Andrei charges at him, sword waving... and Mazeppa shoots him.\n\nMariya arrives, completely mad. She does not recognise Mazeppa, and has convinced herself that her father's trick was just a joke played on her by her mother. But she sees blood everywhere. Mazeppa tries to comfort her – she starts to be, and babbles to him, but then sees blood on his face, and apologises: She had thought him someone else, but the person she thought he was had white hair, and his is covered with blood. Orlik returns and warns Mazeppa that troops approach – Mazeppa wants to take Mariya, but Orlik points out she'd slow them down. He asks whether Mazeppa cares more for a mad woman or his own head, and Mazeppa reluctantly leaves Mariya behind.\n\nMariya finds Andrei, and the blood on him – she cries out at finding blood everywhere, and remembers \"dreams\" of an execution. Andrei stirs, not quite dead, and Mariya mistakes him for a young child. He begs Mariya to look at him so he can see her face one last time – but she is in her own world, and just sings a lullaby to him, not realising what's happening or who he is. Part way through it, he dies, giving her one last farewell.

{"id": "2015367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015367", "title": "Two-hybrid screening", "text": "Two-hybrid screening\n\nTwo-hybrid screening (originally known as yeast two-hybrid system or Y2H) is a molecular biology technique used to discover protein–protein interactions (PPIs) and protein–DNA interactions by testing for physical interactions (such as binding) between two proteins or a single protein and a DNA molecule, respectively.\n\nThe premise behind the test is the activation of downstream reporter gene(s) by the binding of a transcription factor onto an upstream activating sequence (UAS). For two-hybrid screening, the transcription factor is split into two separate fragments, called the DNA-binding domain (DBD or often also abbreviated as BD) and activating domain (AD). The BD is the domain responsible for binding to the UAS and the AD is the domain responsible for the activation of transcription. The Y2H is thus a protein-fragment complementation assay.\n\nPioneered by Stanley Fields and Ok-Kyu Song in 1989, the technique was originally designed to detect protein–protein interactions using the Gal4 transcriptional activator of the yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\". The Gal4 protein activated transcription of a gene involved in galactose utilization, which formed the basis of selection. Since then, the same principle has been adapted to describe many alternative methods, including some that detect protein–DNA interactions or DNA-DNA interactions, as well as methods that use different host organisms such as \"Escherichia coli\" or mammalian cells instead of yeast.\n\nThe key to the two-hybrid screen is that in most eukaryotic transcription factors, the activating and binding domains are modular and can function in proximity to each other without direct binding. This means that even though the transcription factor is split into two fragments, it can still activate transcription when the two fragments are indirectly connected.\n\nThe most common screening approach is the yeast two-hybrid assay. In this approach the researcher knows where each prey is located on the used medium (agar plates). Millions of potential interactions in several organisms have been screened in the latest decade using high-throughput screening systems (often using robots) and over thousands of interactions have been detected and categorized in databases as BioGRID. This system often utilizes a genetically engineered strain of yeast in which the biosynthesis of certain nutrients (usually amino acids or nucleic acids) is lacking. When grown on media that lacks these nutrients, the yeast fail to survive. This mutant yeast strain can be made to incorporate foreign DNA in the form of plasmids. In yeast two-hybrid screening, separate bait and prey plasmids are simultaneously introduced into the mutant yeast strain or a mating strategy is used to get both plasmids in one host cell.\n\nThe second high-throughput approach is the library screening approach. In this set up the bait and prey harboring cells are mated in a random order. After mating and selecting surviving cells on selective medium the scientist will sequence the isolated plasmids to see which prey (DNA sequence) is interacting with the used bait. This approach has a lower rate of reproducibility and tends to yield higher amounts of false positives compared to the matrix approach.\n\nPlasmids are engineered to produce a protein product in which the DNA-binding domain (BD) fragment is fused onto a protein while another plasmid is engineered to produce a protein product in which the activation domain (AD) fragment is fused onto another protein. The protein fused to the BD may be referred to as the bait protein, and is typically a known protein the investigator is using to identify new binding partners. The protein fused to the AD may be referred to as the prey protein and can be either a single known protein or a library of known or unknown proteins. In this context, a library may consist of a collection of protein-encoding sequences that represent all the proteins expressed in a particular organism or tissue, or may be generated by synthesising random DNA sequences. Regardless of the source, they are subsequently incorporated into the protein-encoding sequence of a plasmid, which is then transfected into the cells chosen for the screening method. This technique, when using a library, assumes that each cell is transfected with no more than a single plasmid and that, therefore, each cell ultimately expresses no more than a single member from the protein library.\n\nIf the bait and prey proteins interact (i.e., bind), then the AD and BD of the transcription factor are indirectly connected, bringing the AD in proximity to the transcription start site and transcription of reporter gene(s) can occur. If the two proteins do not interact, there is no transcription of the reporter gene. In this way, a successful interaction between the fused protein is linked to a change in the cell phenotype.\n\nThe challenge of separating cells that express proteins that happen to interact with their counterpart fusion proteins from those that do not, is addressed in the following section.\n\nIn any study, some of the protein domains, those under investigation, will be varied according to the goals of the study whereas other domains, those that are not themselves being investigated, will be kept constant. For example, in a two-hybrid study to select DNA-binding domains, the DNA-binding domain, BD, will be varied while the two interacting proteins, the bait and prey, must be kept constant to maintain a strong binding between the BD and AD. There are a number of domains from which to choose the BD, bait and prey and AD, if these are to remain constant. In protein–protein interaction investigations, the BD may be chosen from any of many strong DNA-binding domains such as Zif268. A frequent choice of bait and prey domains are residues 263–352 of yeast Gal11P with a N342V mutation and residues 58–97 of yeast Gal4, respectively. These domains can be used in both yeast- and bacterial-based selection techniques and are known to bind together strongly.\n\nThe AD chosen must be able to activate transcription of the reporter gene, using the cell's own transcription machinery. Thus, the variety of ADs available for use in yeast-based techniques may not be suited to use in their bacterial-based analogues. The herpes simplex virus-derived AD, VP16 and yeast Gal4 AD have been used with success in yeast whilst a portion of the α-subunit of \"E. coli\" RNA polymerase has been utilised in \"E. coli\"-based methods.\n\nWhilst powerfully activating domains may allow greater sensitivity towards weaker interactions, conversely, a weaker AD may provide greater stringency.\n\nA number of engineered genetic sequences must be incorporated into the host cell to perform two-hybrid analysis or one of its derivative techniques. The considerations and methods used in the construction and delivery of these sequences differ according to the needs of the assay and the organism chosen as the experimental background.\n\nThere are two broad categories of hybrid library: random libraries and cDNA-based libraries. A cDNA library is constituted by the cDNA produced through reverse transcription of mRNA collected from specific cells of types of cell. This library can be ligated into a construct so that it is attached to the BD or AD being used in the assay. A random library uses lengths of DNA of random sequence in place of these cDNA sections. A number of methods exist for the production of these random sequences, including cassette mutagenesis. Regardless of the source of the DNA library, it is ligated into the appropriate place in the relevant plasmid/phagemid using the appropriate restriction endonucleases.\n\nBy placing the hybrid proteins under the control of IPTG-inducible \"lac\" promoters, they are expressed only on media supplemented with IPTG. Further, by including different antibiotic resistance genes in each genetic construct, the growth of non-transformed cells is easily prevented through culture on media containing the corresponding antibiotics. This is particularly important for counter selection methods in which a \"lack\" of interaction is needed for cell survival.\n\nThe reporter gene may be inserted into the \"E. coli\" genome by first inserting it into an episome, a type of plasmid with the ability to incorporate itself into the bacterial cell genome with a copy number of approximately one per cell.\n\nThe hybrid expression phagemids can be electroporated into \"E. coli\" XL-1 Blue cells which after amplification and infection with VCS-M13 helper phage, will yield a stock of library phage. These phage will each contain one single-stranded member of the phagemid library.\n\nOnce the selection has been performed, the primary structure of the proteins which display the appropriate characteristics must be determined. This is achieved by retrieval of the protein-encoding sequences (as originally inserted) from the cells showing the appropriate phenotype.\n\nThe phagemid used to transform \"E. coli\" cells may be \"rescued\" from the selected cells by infecting them with VCS-M13 helper phage. The resulting phage particles that are produced contain the single-stranded phagemids and are used to infect XL-1 Blue cells. The double-stranded phagemids are subsequently collected from these XL-1 Blue cells, essentially reversing the process used to produce the original library phage. Finally, the DNA sequences are determined through dideoxy sequencing.\n\nThe \"Escherichia coli\"-derived Tet-R repressor can be used in line with a conventional reporter gene and can be controlled by tetracycline or doxicycline (Tet-R inhibitors). Thus the expression of Tet-R is controlled by the standard two-hybrid system but the Tet-R in turn controls (represses) the expression of a previously mentioned reporter such as \"HIS3\", through its Tet-R promoter. Tetracycline or its derivatives can then be used to regulate the sensitivity of a system utilising Tet-R.\n\nSensitivity may also be controlled by varying the dependency of the cells on their reporter genes. For example, this may be affected by altering the concentration of histidine in the growth medium for \"his3\"-dependent cells and altering the concentration of streptomycin for \"aadA\" dependent cells. Selection-gene-dependency may also be controlled by applying an inhibitor of the selection gene at a suitable concentration. 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) for example, is a competitive inhibitor of the \"HIS3\"-gene product and may be used to titrate the minimum level of \"HIS3\" expression required for growth on histidine-deficient media.\n\nSensitivity may also be modulated by varying the number of operator sequences in the reporter DNA.\n\nA third, non-fusion protein may be co-expressed with two fusion proteins. Depending on the investigation, the third protein may modify one of the fusion proteins or mediate or interfere with their interaction.\n\nCo-expression of the third protein may be necessary for modification or activation of one or both of the fusion proteins. For example, \"S. cerevisiae\" possesses no endogenous tyrosine kinase. If an investigation involves a protein that requires tyrosine phosphorylation, the kinase must be supplied in the form of a tyrosine kinase gene.\n\nThe non-fusion protein may mediate the interaction by binding both fusion proteins simultaneously, as in the case of ligand-dependent receptor dimerization.\n\nFor a protein with an interacting partner, its functional homology to other proteins may be assessed by supplying the third protein in non-fusion form, which then may or may not compete with the fusion-protein for its binding partner. Binding between the third protein and the other fusion protein will interrupt the formation of the reporter expression activation complex and thus reduce reporter expression, leading to the distinguishing change in phenotype.\n\nOne limitation of classic yeast two-hybrid screens is that they are limited to soluble proteins. It is therefore impossible to use them to study the protein–protein interactions between insoluble integral membrane proteins. The split-ubiquitin system provides a method for overcoming this limitation. In the split-ubiquitin system, two integral membrane proteins to be studied are fused to two different ubiquitin moieties: a C-terminal ubiquitin moiety (\"Cub\", residues 35–76) and an N-terminal ubiquitin moiety (\"Nub\", residues 1–34). These fused proteins are called the bait and prey, respectively. In addition to being fused to an integral membrane protein, the Cub moiety is also fused to a transcription factor (TF) that can be cleaved off by ubiquitin specific proteases. Upon bait–prey interaction, Nub and Cub-moieties assemble, reconstituting the split-ubiquitin. The reconstituted split-ubiquitin molecule is recognized by ubiquitin specific proteases, which cleave off the transcription factor, allowing it to induce the transcription of reporter genes.\n\nZolghadr and co-workers presented a fluorescent two-hybrid system that uses two hybrid proteins that are fused to different fluorescent proteins as well as LacI, the lac repressor. The structure of the fusion proteins looks like this: FP2-LacI-bait and FP1-prey where the bait and prey proteins interact and bring the fluorescent proteins (FP1 = GFP, FP2=mCherry) in close proximity at the binding site of the LacI protein in the host cell genome. The system can also be used to screen for inhibitors of protein–protein interactions.\n\nWhile the original Y2H system used a reconstituted transcription factor, other systems create enzymatic activities to detect PPIs. For instance, the KInase Substrate Sensor (\"KISS\"), is a mammalian two-hybrid approach has been designed to map intracellular PPIs. Here, a bait protein is fused to a kinase-containing portion of TYK2 and a prey is coupled to a gp130 cytokine receptor fragment. When bait and prey interact, TYK2 phosphorylates STAT3 docking sites on the prey chimera, which ultimately leads to activation of a reporter gene.\n\nThe one-hybrid variation of this technique is designed to investigate protein–DNA interactions and uses a single fusion protein in which the AD is linked directly to the binding domain. The binding domain in this case however is not necessarily of fixed sequence as in two-hybrid protein–protein analysis but may be constituted by a library. This library can be selected against the desired target sequence, which is inserted in the promoter region of the reporter gene construct. In a positive-selection system, a binding domain that successfully binds the UAS and allows transcription is thus selected.\n\nNote that selection of DNA-binding domains is not necessarily performed using a one-hybrid system, but may also be performed using a two-hybrid system in which the binding domain is varied and the bait and prey proteins are kept constant.\n\nRNA-protein interactions have been investigated through a three-hybrid variation of the two-hybrid technique. In this case, a hybrid RNA molecule serves to adjoin together the two protein fusion domains—which are not intended to interact with each other but rather the intermediary RNA molecule (through their RNA-binding domains). Techniques involving non-fusion proteins that perform a similar function, as described in the 'non-fusion proteins' section above, may also be referred to as three-hybrid methods.\n\nSimultaneous use of the one- and two-hybrid methods (that is, simultaneous protein–protein and protein–DNA interaction) is known as a one-two-hybrid approach and expected to increase the stringency of the screen.\n\nAlthough theoretically, any living cell might be used as the background to a two-hybrid analysis, there are practical considerations that dictate which is chosen. The chosen cell line should be relatively cheap and easy to culture and sufficiently robust to withstand application of the investigative methods and reagents. The latter is especially important for doing high-throughput studies. Therefore the yeast \"S. cerevisiae\" has been the main host organism for two-hybrid studies. However it is not always the ideal system to study interacting proteins from other organisms. Yeast cells often do not have the same post translational modifications, have a different codon use or lack certain proteins that are important for the correct expression of the proteins. To cope with these problems several novel two-hybrid systems have been developed. Depending on the system used agar plates or specific growth medium is used to grow the cells and allow selection for interaction. The most common used method is the agar plating one where cells are plated on selective medium to see of interaction takes place. Cells that have no interaction proteins should not survive on this selective medium.\n\nThe yeast \"S. cerevisiae\" was the model organism used during the two-hybrid technique's inception. It is commonly known as the Y2H system. It has several characteristics that make it a robust organism to host the interaction, including the ability to form tertiary protein structures, neutral internal pH, enhanced ability to form disulfide bonds and reduced-state glutathione among other cytosolic buffer factors, to maintain a hospitable internal environment. The yeast model can be manipulated through non-molecular techniques and its complete genome sequence is known. Yeast systems are tolerant of diverse culture conditions and harsh chemicals that could not be applied to mammalian tissue cultures.\n\nA number of yeast strains have been created specifically for Y2H screens, e.g. Y187 and AH109, both produced by Clontech. Yeast strains R2HMet and BK100 have also been used.\n\n\"C. albicans\" is a yeast with a particular feature: it translates the CUG codon into serine rather than leucine. Due to this different codon usage it is difficult to use the model system \"S. cerevisiae\" as a Y2H to check for protein-protein interactions using \"C. albicans\" genes. To provide a more native environment a \"C. albicans\" two-hybrid (C2H) system was developed. With this system protein-protein interactions can be studied in \"C. albicans\" itself. A recent addition was the creation of a high-throughput system.\n\nBacterial \"E. coli\"-based two hybrid methods (abbreviated as B2H) have several characteristics that may make them preferable to yeast-based homologues. The higher transformation efficiency and faster rate of growth lends \"E. coli\" to the use of larger libraries (in excess of 10). A low false positive rate of approximately 3x10, the absence of requirement for a nuclear localisation signal to be included in the protein sequence and the ability to study proteins that would be toxic to yeast may also be major factors to consider when choosing an experimental background organism.\n\nIt may be of note that the methylation activity of certain \"E. coli\" DNA methyltransferase proteins may interfere with some DNA-binding protein selections. If this is anticipated, the use of an \"E. coli\" strain that is defective for a particular methyltransferase may be an obvious solution. Important to mention is that bacteria are prokaryotic organisms and when studying eukaryotic protein-protein interactions (e.g. human proteins) the results need to be carefully approached.\n\nIn recent years a mammalian two hybrid (M2H) system has been designed to study mammalian protein-protein interactions in a cellular environment that closely mimics the native protein environment. Transiently transfected mammalian cells are used in this system to find protein-protein interactions.\nUsing a mammalian cell line to study mammalian protein-protein interactions gives the advantage of working in a more native context.\nThe post-translational modifications, phosphorylation, acylation and glycosylation are similar. The intracellular localization of the proteins is also more correct compared to using a yeast two hybrid system.\n\nIt is also possible with the mammalian two-hybrid system to study signal inputs.\nAnother big advantage is that results can be obtained within 48 hours after transfection.\n\nIn 2005 a two hybrid system in plants was developed. Using protoplasts of \"A. thaliana\" protein-protein interactions can be studied in plants. This way the interactions can be studied in their native context. In this system the GAL4 AD and BD are under the control of the strong 35S promoter. Interaction is measured using a GUS reporter. In order to enable a high-throughput screening the vectors were made gateway compatible.\nThe system is known as the protoplast two hybrid (P2H) system.\n\nThe sea hare \"A californica\" is a model organism in neurobiology to study among others the molecular mechanisms of long-term memory. To study interactions, important in neurology, in a more native environment a two-hybrid system has been developed in \"A californica\" neurons. A GAL4 AD and BD are used in this system.\n\nAn insect two-hybrid (I2H) system was developed in a silkworm cell line from the larva or caterpillar of the domesticated silk moth, \"Bombyx mori\" (BmN4 cells). This system uses the GAL4 BD and the activation domain of mouse NF-κB P65. Both are under the control of the OpIE2 promoter.\n\nBy changing specific amino acids by mutating the corresponding DNA base-pairs in the plasmids used, the importance of those amino acid residues in maintaining the interaction can be determined.\n\nAfter using bacterial cell-based method to select DNA-binding proteins, it is necessary to check the specificity of these domains as there is a limit to the extent to which the bacterial cell genome can act as a sink for domains with an affinity for other sequences (or indeed, a general affinity for DNA).\n\nProtein–protein signalling interactions pose suitable therapeutic targets due to their specificity and pervasiveness. The random drug discovery approach uses compound banks that comprise random chemical structures, and requires a high-throughput method to test these structures in their intended target.\n\nThe cell chosen for the investigation can be specifically engineered to mirror the molecular aspect that the investigator intends to study and then used to identify new human or animal therapeutics or anti-pest agents.\n\nBy determination of the interaction partners of unknown proteins, the possible functions of these new proteins may be inferred. This can be done using a single known protein against a library of unknown proteins or conversely, by selecting from a library of known proteins using a single protein of unknown function.\n\nTo select zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) for protein engineering, methods adapted from the two-hybrid screening technique have been used with success. A ZFP is itself a DNA-binding protein used in the construction of custom DNA-binding domains that bind to a desired DNA sequence.\n\nBy using a selection gene with the desired target sequence included in the UAS, and randomising the relevant amino acid sequences to produce a ZFP library, cells that host a DNA-ZFP interaction with the required characteristics can be selected. Each ZFP typically recognises only 3–4 base pairs, so to prevent recognition of sites outside the UAS, the randomised ZFP is engineered into a 'scaffold' consisting of another two ZFPs of constant sequence. The UAS is thus designed to include the target sequence of the constant scaffold in addition to the sequence for which a ZFP is selected.\n\nA number of other DNA-binding domains may also be investigated using this system.\n\n\nThe reason for this high error rate lies in the characteristics of the screen:\n\nEach of these points alone can give rise to false results. Due to the combined effects of all error sources yeast two-hybrid have to be interpreted with caution. The probability of generating false positives means that all interactions should be confirmed by a high confidence assay, for example co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins, which is difficult for large scale protein–protein interaction data. Alternatively, Y2H data can be verified using multiple Y2H variants or bioinformatics techniques. The latter test whether interacting proteins are expressed at the same time, share some common features (such as gene ontology annotations or certain network topologies), have homologous interactions in other species.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1992 as the Western Reds, they entered into the Australian Rugby League competition in 1995 before defecting to the rival Super League competition in 1997, where they rebranded themselves as the Perth Reds. However, by the end of the year the Reds had become a casualty of the Super League War peace deal and were shut down. The name Reds was named after the native Red Kangaroos. The Reds entered a state of limbo for the next decade but were revived as a lower-level club in 2006 by the WARL and ARL, under the name WA Reds.\n\nThe Reds had recruited well in 1993–94, and signed Peter Mulholland as their first coach. St. George fullback Michael Potter (twice winner of the Dally M Award), 1992 Rookie of year and CLEO bachelor of the year Matthew Rodwell, and Australian and NSW rep player Brad Mackay were three of the major signings.\n\nTheir first game, played at the WACA, was watched by a record 24,392, with the Reds defeating St George 28–16. When News Limited began its \"blitzkrieg\" in April 1995, the Reds aligned themselves with Super League along with nine other Australian Rugby League clubs. That season the Reds were the best performing of the three expansion teams introduced, winning 11 of their 22 games, including 8 at home, which drew an average crowd of around 13,000, larger than that of many Sydney teams.\n\nThe Reds even recruited local identity and decorated WAFL and West Coast Eagles (AFL) player Adrian Barich. Barich, having grown up in Canberra reverted from Australian rules football to rugby league, finishing his career with seasons with the Reds, however he never played in first grade.\n\nAfter declaring that the club may not have the financial resources to compete in the 1996 ARL Optus Cup, a major sponsorship with the Rupert Murdoch-owned Sunday Times gave the club some much needed money. By mid 1996 club support had dwindled to just over 6,000.\n\nIn 1997 the Reds became one of eight ARL teams to join the rival Super League during the dispute known as the Super League war. They changed their name to the Perth City Reds for the 1997 Super League season, and adopted a jersey of red, white and black. Although the club had made some promising signings, such as Rodney Howe and Robbie Kearns, the crushing $10 million debt that hung over the club (from having to pay the airfares for all visiting teams) at the end of the season led to Super League axing the Perth Reds on 1 October 1997.\n\nRugby league has continued to be played in Western Australia since the Reds left the top-flight competition with the Swan Brewery Cup continuing and NRL matches being staged at various times since 1998. On 8 May 1999, Melbourne Storm played Western Suburbs Magpies at Lathlain Park in Perth, with Melbourne running out winners 62–6. In 2005, Cronulla Sharks took their home game against the New Zealand Warriors to Perth Oval, and played in front of around 13,000 spectators.\n\nThe WARL resurrected the Reds in 2006 with the intent of joining the National Rugby League in the future. In 2008 the Reds joined the Jim Beam Cup and played out of Perth Oval.\n\nIn the 2009 Bundaberg Red Cup the Reds were winless until the back-end of the season when they won 3 of their 4 last games, giving them something to build on for the next season. Darwin Rugby League product Aaron Barnes was named the Reds' player of the year. Unfortunately for financial reasons the Reds snr team was withdrawn from the Bundy Cup for 2010.\n\nIn 2010 the WA Reds entered an Under 18's team in the S. G. Ball Cup competition. The first trial game on 30 January 2010 was against the runners-up of the Western Australia Rugby League competition the Central Bulldogs — they won 38–20. The WARL have set up two junior academies to help develop players for a return to the NRL with the SG Ball side providing a staging ground for player development. The WA Reds juniors won their first SG Ball game beating the Balmain Tigers at ME Stadium 28–8.\n\nWhilst the team found it tough going against often bigger and more experienced sides they did claim a couple of scalps and at the end of the season Curtis Rona was signed by the Sydney Roosters, earning a call up to the under 20s side during 2010.\n\nA new bid logo was launched in 2010 and membership for fans was made available. NRL CEO David Gallop recognised the WA Reds 2013 bid on a number of occasions, speaking positively about the potential for a Perth team in the NRL.\n\nIn 2012 the WARL launched the West Coast Pirates as the Perth bid team for an NRL licence.

The SOC-3 design was the basis of the Naval Aircraft Factory SON-1 variant, of which the NAF delivered 64 aircraft from 1940.\n\nThe SOC was ordered for production by the United States Navy in 1933 and first entered service in 1935. The first order was for 135 SOC-1 models, which was followed by 40 SOC-2 models for landing operations and 83 SOC-3s. A variant of the SOC-3 was built by the Naval Aircraft Factory and was known as the SON-1.\n\nThe first ship the SOC was assigned to was the light cruiser in November 1935; by the end of the decade, the SOC had replaced its predecessor throughout the fleet. Production came to an end in 1938. By 1941, most battleships had transitioned to the Vought OS2U Kingfisher and cruisers were expected to replace their aging SOCs with the third generation SO3C Seamew. The SO3C, however, suffered from a weak engine and plans to adopt it as a replacement were scrapped. The SOC, despite belonging to an earlier generation, went on to execute its missions of gunfire observation and limited range scouting missions.\n\nThrough the first six months of naval service, the SOC was known as the XO3C-1, The designation was changed to SOC when it was decided to merge its scouting and observation roles. The SOC was not called the \"Seagull\" until 1941, when the U.S. Navy began the wholesale adoption of popular names for aircraft in addition to their alpha-numeric designations. The name 'Seagull' had earlier been given to two civil Curtiss aircraft, a Curtiss Model 18 and a Model 25, both converted Curtiss MF flying boats.\n\nWhen operating as a seaplane, returning SOCs would land on the relatively smooth ocean surface created on the sheltered side of the vessel as it made a wide turn, after which the aircraft would be winched back onto the deck.\n\nWhen the SOC was replaced by the OS2U Kingfisher, most remaining airframes were converted into trainers; they remained in use until 1945. With the failure of the Curtiss SO3C Seamew, many SOCs in second line service were returned to frontline units starting in late 1943. They saw service aboard warships in the combat zone for the rest of World War II. This is one of the few instances in aviation history in which an older aircraft type, that was retired or sent to second line service, replaced the new aircraft type that was intended to replace it.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A feature writer for \"The New York Times, Entertainment Weekly,\" and \"USA Weekend\", she was named the Society of Professional Journalists' National Member of the Year in 1994. In 1977, Nash's job afforded her the opportunity to become one of the journalists to view the remains of Elvis Presley. In her dust jacket biography for her book \"Baby, Let's Play House\", she was described as \"the first journalist to see Elvis Presley in his casket\".\n\nNash's much-reprinted 1978 biography of Dolly Parton included material gathered from a long interview with its subject, that took place over the course of several days. The biography, \"Dolly\", was published just as Parton reached mainstream appeal outside of the country music world, via her now-famous pop-music crossover. Nash has closely followed Parton's career since, having also written numerous magazine articles about her and reviewing a number of Parton's albums.\n\nIn 1988 Nash received acclaim for her book on Jessica Savitch, \"Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch\", which was the basis for the 1996 motion picture \"Up Close & Personal\", as well as a made-for-television movie named \"Almost Golden\". In the 1990s Nash began researching the life of Elvis Presley in order to write a book. Although there were already several hundred Presley books on the market, her 1995 book, \"\", provided what \"Entertainment Weekly\" called \"stunning allegations.\" As a result of Nash being able to get the collaboration of employees Marty Lacker, Lamar Fike, and Presley's first cousin, Billy Smith who lived and worked with Presley throughout his life, she provided a look at Presley not previously published. \n\nHer research into Presley led to a second book on Colonel Tom Parker. While covering Presley's death, Alanna Nash had seen what most of the throng of reporters there at the time considered as somewhat bizarre decorum by Parker when he came to the funeral dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and baseball cap. For her 1995 book, Nash had interviewed Colonel Parker but her examination into his life kept unfolding with so many twists and turns that it led to six years of exhaustive research including travel to his birthplace Breda in the Netherlands for documents and interviews. Her book, \"The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley\", was published on July 15, 2003 to acclaim. \"Billboard\" called it a \"classic of music industry reporting\". Other positive reviews came from \"The Washington Post\", \"The New York Review of Books\", \"Variety\", and \"Publishers Weekly\", among others. In the UK, \"Mojo\" music magazine said her book was \"the most incisive and comprehensive look at the life of the elusive Colonel available\" and the reviewer for \"The Observer\" lauded the book as \"perhaps the most thoroughly researched music book ever written\" — before adding that \"sadly most of the story has been told before. Nash simply adds layer after layer of padding.\" \n\nFor her reporting on Colonel Parker, Nash was voted one of the \"Heavy 100 of Country Music\" by \"Esquire\" magazine and earned the 2004 CMA Media Achievement Award and the 2004 Belmont Book Award. She has reviewed for \"Stereo Review\" magazine, \"Reader's Digest\", and Amazon.com as well as others. \n\n"}

The workstation connects to the host through a modem, digital link, packet-switching network or local area network (LAN). RJE is similar to uux and SSH, except that the workstation sends a complete job stream rather than a single command and that the user does not receive any output until the completion of the job..\nThe terms Remote Batch, Remote Job System and Remote Job Processing are also used for RJE facilities.\n\nRemote Job Entry (RJE) is also the name of an OS/360 component that provided RJE services. An RJE workstation operator may have complete console control of the job flow between the workstation and mainframe, depending on local configuration and policy.\n\nHouston Automatic Spooling Priority (HASP) initially supported job entry from terminals using Synchronous transmit-receive (STR); eventually HASP II supported only Binary Synchronous Communications (BSC), and added the Multi-leaving protocol for BSC programmable work stations; this protocol was incompatible with that used by OS/360 RJE and is the basis for protocols used for job submission from programmable work stations for, e.g., JES2, JES3, OS/VS1 RES, VM RSCS, as well as the later protocols for Network Job Entry (NJE) in, e.g., JES2, JES3, VM RSCS. \n\nConversational Remote Job Entry (CRJE) is a component of OS/360 and OS/VS1 that provides job submission, job retrieval and editing for a user at an interactive terminal.\n\nRemote Entry Services (RES) is a component of OS/VS1 that provided RJE services.

{"id": "2015404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015404", "title": "Fabian Nicieza", "text": "Fabian Nicieza\n\nFabian Nicieza (born December 31, 1961) is an Argentine-American comic book writer and editor who is best known for his work on Marvel titles such as \"X-Men\", \"X-Force\", \"New Warriors\", \"Cable, Deadpool\", and \"Thunderbolts\", for all of which he helped create numerous characters.\n\nNicieza was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the son of Omar and Irma Riguetti Nicieza. He was four years old when his family moved to the United States. Growing up in New Jersey, Nicieza learned to read and write from comic books. He lived first in Sayreville, New Jersey and moved to Old Bridge Township, where he attended Madison Central High School, from which he graduated in 1979. He studied at Rutgers University, interning at the ABC television network before graduating in 1983 with a degree in advertising and public relations. His brother is Mariano Nicieza, also a comic book writer and editor.\n\nUntil 1985, Nicieza worked for the Berkley Publishing Group, starting in the production department and becoming a managing editor.\n\nIn 1985, Nicieza joined the staff at Marvel Comics, initially as a manufacturing assistant, later moving to the promotions department as an advertising manager. During this period he began to take his first freelance work for Marvel, writing short articles for Marvel’s promotional magazine \"Marvel Age\".\n\nNicieza's first published comics story came with \"Psi-Force\" No. 9 (July 1987), a title in Marvel's short-lived \"New Universe\" imprint. This led to his becoming that title's regular writer from #16 (Feb. 1988) until #32 (June 1989), the final issue. This led to fill-in work on titles such as \"Classic X-Men\", for which he provided backup stories, and in the Marvel Annuals' 1989 summer crossover \"Atlantis Attacks\".\n\nAfter Tom DeFalco, then Marvel's editor-in-chief, created the superhero team the New Warriors, using existing characters, in \"Thor\" No. 412 (Dec. 1989), he selected Nicieza to write the spin-off series. Nicieza recalled \"I took the assignment for two reasons. First, I saw a lot of potential in these characters that had already been deemed useless. And secondly, I really wanted to write a monthly book.\" Collaborating with pencilers Mark Bagley and later Darick Robertson, primarily, Nicieza went on to write the title for most of its first 53 issues (July 1990 – November 1994). Years later, Nicieza said that he considers the first 25 issues of \"New Warriors\" to be the best work of his career.\n\nAlso in 1990 Nicieza began short runs on comics such as \"Alpha Flight\" (#87–101), \"Avengers\" (#317–325) and \"Avengers Spotlight\", as well as the miniseries \"Nomad\", which in turn led him to write the ongoing series \"Nomad\" vol. 2 in 1992. That year, Nicieza became editor of Marvel's children's imprint, Star Comics. Shortly afterward, he left the Marvel staff and began freelance writing for the company.\n\nNicieza's projects in this period included the first four issues of National Football League-approved superhero \"NFL SuperPro\" (Oct. 1991 – Feb. 1992), and, with penciler Kevin Maguire, the four-issue miniseries \"Adventures of Captain America\" (also known by its cover-logo treatment, \"The Adventures of Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty\") (Sept. 1991 – Jan. 1992), an origin-story retelling set in the 1940s.\n\nIn 1991, Nicieza joined with artist Rob Liefeld in co-plotting and writing the final three issues of the \"New Mutants\". In those issues Liefeld and Nicieza created the characters Deadpool and Shatterstar as well as the super team, X-Force. Liefeld and Nicieza then produced an ongoing \"X-Force\" title. Nicieza initially worked on the title as scripter; after the departure of Liefeld in No. 12 he became its full writer, which he remained until 1995. By the end of 1992, Nicieza became regular scripter for \"X-Men\" vol. 2, beginning with No. 12 (Sept. 1992), working primarily with penciler Andy Kubert throughout his run. For the next three years, Nicieza was among the writers and editors of one of Marvel's most popular superhero franchises during a time of such popular, multi-series crossover story arcs as \"X-Cutioner's Song\", \"Phalanx Covenant\" and \"Age of Apocalypse\".\n\nDuring this period Nicieza wrote the first \"Cable\" miniseries as well as the first few issues of the character's subsequent ongoing series. He also wrote the first solo Deadpool series, \"Deadpool: the Circle Chase\" in 1993. These series expanded the characters' personalities and established key background information for both characters, all things which were later used by other writers on those characters’ subsequent ongoing books.\n\nHowever in 1995, in a dispute with then editor-in-chief Bob Harras over the future direction of his plotlines on \"X-Force\", Nicieza was fired from the X-titles, leaving \"X-Force\" with No. 43 and \"X-Men\" with No. 45. He later remarked, \"I never wanted to leave [\"X-Force\"], and never felt my firing was justified. ... I don't recall being given a reason [for being fired], and I also don't recall asking for one. ... Considering it was a Top 10 selling title at the time, I felt it was a wholly unjustified decision.\"\n\nAfter 1995, Nicieza wrote short runs of \"Captain Marvel \" (vol. 2, 1995), \"Spider-Man: The Final Adventure\" (1995) and stories for \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" before leaving the company in 1996. That year Nicieza did his first work for rival publisher DC Comics, co-writing \"Justice League: Midsummer Nightmare\" with Mark Waid which relaunched the Justice League as the JLA. He also worked for Twist and Shout Comics writing and pencilling back-up stories in \"X-Flies Special #1\" and \"Dirtbag\" #7.\n\nLater in 1996 Nicieza joined Acclaim Comics as senior vice-president and editor-in-chief. He was charged with revamping the companies intellectual properties which had previously formed Valiant Comics' \"Valiant Universe\". Nicieza as editor oversaw the new version, dubbed \"VH2\", which re-imagined characters such as Solar, X-O Manowar, and Ninjak.\n\nNicieza himself wrote the \"Turok\" title as well as a new series, \"Troublemakers\". \"Turok\" met with success as a video game adaptation, and Nicieza was promoted to president and publisher of Acclaim Comics in 1997. He also wrote a \"Turok\" novella during this period. However, after staff cuts and most of the lines' cancellation, Nicieza left Acclaim in 1999.\n\nReturning to freelance work, Marvel and the X-Men, Nicieza co-wrote the \"Magneto Wars\" crossover through \"Uncanny X-Men\" #366–367 and \"X-Men\" vol. 2, #86–87, with artist Alan Davis in 1999. This led to the successive Magneto limited series \"Magneto Rex\" (1999) and \"Magneto: Dark Seduction\" (2000), as well as an ongoing \"Gambit\" (1999) series which he wrote for the first 24 issues of its 25-issue run.\n\nAlso in 1999, Nicieza began writing \"Thunderbolts\" with #34. He continued to write the book (initially with old partner Mark Bagley on art, later with Patrick Zircher and Chris Batista) up until No. 75 when the title was revamped. The revamp was unsuccessful, and in 2004 the original version of the team was resurrected, initially in an \"Avengers/Thunderbolts\" miniseries, then later in the \"New Thunderbolts\" series with Nicieza again as writer.\n\nNicieza also worked on several limited series at Marvel and DC around the turn of the century. At Marvel he wrote \"Citizen V\" (2001), \"Citizen V and the V Battalion: Everlasting (2002)\", \"X-Men Forever\" (2001), and \"X-Force\" vol. 2, as well as the short-lived ongoing series \"Hawkeye\" (2003); while at DC, he wrote the six-issue miniseries \"Supermen of America\" (1999) and the Elseworlds project \"JLA: Created Equal\" (2000), as well as some issues of the children's comic \"Justice League Adventures\".\n\nIn 2003 Nicieza co-created, with artist Stefano Raffaele, the horror miniseries \"The Blackburne Covenant\", published by Dark Horse Comics. That same year he returned to two of his old characters with the Marvel series \"Cable and Deadpool\", of which he wrote all 50 issues.\n\nIn 2006, Nicieza returned to DC with a three-issue arc in \"Action Comics\" #841–843 (July–Sept. 2006), co-written with Kurt Busiek. Nicieza also wrote \"JSA Classified\" #28. He is also one of the co-writers for \"The 99\", an \"Islamic culture-based comic book\" with Kuwaiti Naif Al-Mutawa, Other late-2000s DC work includes \"Nightwing\" and \"Robin\", both titles being cancelled in connection with \"Batman R.I.P.\" and Nicieza then wrote an \"\" mini-series, part of the Battle for the Cowl storyline which dealt with the \"Batman R.I.P.\" aftermath. After \"Death's Dark Knight\" concluded, Nicieza wrote the new \"Azrael\" ongoing series from issue #1–13 (December 2009 – December 2010).\n\nNicieza began writing the DC series \"Red Robin\" from issues #13-26, the final issue (Aug. 2010 - Aug. 2011). DC announced Nicieza would be writing \"Legion Lost\", a spinoff of Legion of Superheroes as part of DC's line wide relaunch initiative in September 2011. Nicieza wrote the first six issues before leaving the title. In 2016, for the comics company Shatner Singularity, he adapted a Stan Lee poem into the graphic novel \"Stan Lee's 'God Woke\"'. That work won the 2017 Independent Publisher Book Awards' Outstanding Books of the Year Independent Voice Award.\n\nIn non-comics works, Nicieza co-scripted the direct-to-DVD animated feature \"Hot Wheels World Race\", and the computer-animated DVD feature \"The Black Belt Club\", based on the Scholastic book series.\n\n"}

She was the daughter of the banker and diplomat Andrew W. Mellon and Nora Mary (née McMullen) Mellon (1879–1937). Her parents divorced in 1912 and from 1921 to 1932, Ailsa served as her father's official hostess during his tenure as United States Secretary of the Treasury, and again when he was U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1932–1933. Her only sibling was brother Paul Mellon (1907–1999), who was also a philanthropist and was known as a prominent owner/breeder of thoroughbred racehorses.\n\nAilsa attended Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut and spent her summers as a teenager in Europe.\n\nBruce established the Avalon Foundation in 1940, which made grants to colleges and universities, medical schools and hospitals, youth programs and community services, churches, environmental projects, and an array of cultural and arts organizations. In 1947, the Avalon Foundation was instrumental in the establishment of the Hampton National Historic Site in Maryland.\n\nIn 1957, when \"Fortune\" prepared its first list of the wealthiest Americans, it estimated that Ailsa Mellon Bruce, her brother, Paul, and her cousins, Sarah Mellon and Richard King Mellon, were all among the richest eight people in the United States, with fortunes of between 400 and 700 million dollars each. In 1968, Ailsa and Paul donated $20 million to build an annex to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\n\nAt her death in 1969, Ailsa Bruce bequeathed 153 paintings, primarily by 19th-century French artists, to the National Gallery of Art, as well as establishing a fund for future acquisitions. Among the many works acquired by the Gallery through the Ailsa Mellon Bruce Fund was the portrait of \"Ginevra de' Benci\", the only painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the United States. In 1969, the assets of Paul Mellon’s Old Dominion Foundation were merged into his sister's Avalon Foundation, which was renamed the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in honor of their father.\n\nShe dated Prince Otto Bismarck, the grandson of Otto von Bismarck, the \"Iron Chancellor\", and was close to marrying him, but decided to marry David Bruce, an American, instead.\n\nOn May 23, 1926, she was married to David Kirkpatrick Este Bruce (1898–1977), a scion of a prominent Virginia family including his father William Cabell Bruce, a U.S. Senator from Maryland, and brother James Cabell Bruce, the U.S. Ambassador to Argentina. Their engagement, marriage (which was attended by President and Mrs. Coolidge) and honeymoon were followed closely by the news media. In 1933, after seven years of marriage, Ailsa gave birth to her only child; \n\n\nShe obtained a divorce from her husband in Palm Beach, Florida in April 1945 on the grounds of \"desertion and mental cruelty\", receiving sole custody of their 11 year old daughter. Following their divorce, her ex-husband would later become the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1961 to 1969, the same position her father held.\n\nAfter her divorce, Mrs. Bruce was in a long rumored relationship with G. Lauder Greenway of the Lauder Greenway Family. In addition to their personal links, Greenway was a longtime trustee of Bruce's Avalon Foundation.\n\nShe died on August 25, 1969 at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City. She had homes at 960 Fifth Avenue and a 121 acre estate in Syosset, New York on Long Island. Her obituary in \"The New York Times\" called her the \"Richest Woman in U.S.\"\n\nWhen Audrey and her husband, Stephen Currier, died in a presumed plane crash in 1967, leaving three young children – Andrea Currier, Lavinia Currier, and Michael Stephen Currier (1961–1998), she decided to bequeath her collection of 18th-century English furniture and ceramics to the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n"}

Lorne Michaels added four new featured players: Andy Samberg, Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig (partway through the season), and Jason Sudeikis, who was added for the last three episodes of the previous season.\n\nHader quickly became popular for his impersonations, such as Vincent Price, Lindsey Buckingham, Al Pacino, Alan Alda, James Carville, John Boehner, Julian Assange, and many others. Hader also created multiple signature characters.

The font was in a plain greyish colour with bold lettering, where each word is progressively larger than the last in both the title and cast credits, with footage of New York City in the background. The musical guest and host's pictures are simply seen over top of the background footage instead of inserted onto a billboard like the previous season.\n\nWith the Jaime Pressly episode airing on October 7, 2006, the montage was changed slightly to include an \"SNL\" logo changed to a design and typeface identical to the 1981–1985 \"SNL\" logo. The pictures of the host and musical guest were placed over the entire screen, instead of over the New York City footage. This new montage was also used for the rerun for the Dane Cook/The Killers episode, replacing the originally-aired one.\n\nAlso changing for the October 14, 2006 repeat was the logo. The logo kept the same look, but condensed to look thinner, and to fit wide screen.\n\nThe commercial bumpers featured the host and musical guest in a solid color background, that featured many colors. The logo usually featured the current logo of \"Saturday Night Live\", or bold lettering of \"SNL\". The font is Gotham Ultra Bold.\n\n\"SNL\" had a smaller cast in the 2006–2007 season due to “massive budget cuts” at NBC. Lorne Michaels said that cutting staff was chosen over reducing from 20 the number of original episodes produced. A separate announcement confirmed the departure of Tina Fey, who left to focus on her new show \"30 Rock\". Rachel Dratch, one of the stars in the \"30 Rock\" pilot (though subsequently replaced by Jane Krakowski), also did not return.\n\nIn September 2006, it was announced that Seth Meyers would replace Tina Fey as co-anchor on Weekend Update.\n\nKristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Andy Samberg, and Jason Sudeikis were all promoted to repertory players at the beginning of their second season (the third for Sudeikis including his role as a featured player).\n\nThe final cast list included just 11 members, the lowest number since the 1997–1998 season, and the first time since the 1997–98 season that no featured players were hired.\n\n\n\nThe 2007–2008 season of \"Saturday Night Live\" began on September 29, 2007 with LeBron James hosting the episode and musical guest Kanye West. Production was suspended due to the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, after which only four episodes were produced.\nThe show's first episode after the writers' strike was aired on February 23, 2008, with former head writer and cast member Tina Fey as host.\n\nThe opening montage for the 2007–2008 season was identical to that of the previous season, though the artwork for the host and musical guest is now a black and white portrait.\n\nInstead of featuring a solid color background, the background colors for the bumpers were usually white. There were rare occasions of the background being black, or gray. The logo was the same as last season, either featuring the full current logo, \"Saturday Night Live\", or featuring a bold lettering of \"SNL\". The logos featured different colors.\n\n\n\"Featuring\"\n\n\nThe 2008–2009 season of \"Saturday Night Live\" began September 13, 2008 with host Michael Phelps and musical guest Lil' Wayne.\n\nThe opening montage remains the same as the last two seasons, but this time, the majority of the opening is in black and white, while the cast credits remain in color. The \"SNL\" logo and the cast credits appear smaller to fit into the 4:3 \"safe area\". In the second episode of the season, the video for Casey Wilson's credit was changed. In the fourth episode, the show went back to being shown in letterbox in some markets.\n\nThe bumpers now have variously colored backdrops instead of the plain white from last season. The season's first three episodes had the \"SNL\" logo within the 4:3 \"title-safe area.\" From episode 4 and on, however, the logo has been in the 16:9 title-safe area.\n\n\n\"Featuring\"\n\n\nThe 2009–2010 season of Saturday Night Live began September 26, 2009 with host Megan Fox and musical guest U2.\n\nThe opening montage introduced on the 35th-season premiere featured the cast in random places in New York City. The montage features the same logo as the previous seasons but instead of the greyish color it's now a light greenish color with bold lettering. The host and musical guest are pictures cover the entire screen when introduced. In the second episode the host and musical guest have a small picture that is circled with bright colors, the background features it going down a city street.\n\nThe commercial bumpers featured the host and musical guest in a light color background. The logo usually featured the current logo of \"Saturday Night Live\", or bold lettering of \"SNL\" (often with the number \"35\" attached to commemorate \"SNL\"'s 35 years on the air).\n\n\n\"Featuring\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2015421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015421", "title": "Rosario Salazar", "text": "Rosario Salazar\n\nRosario Inés Consuelo Yolanda Salazar (previously McFarland; also known as \"Rosie\" and \"Ro-Ro\") was a fictional character on the American television sitcom \"Will & Grace\", portrayed by actress Shelley Morrison. Originally due to appear just once, the character was so popular with audiences that the show's writers made her a semi-regular character.\n\nA native of El Salvador, Rosario was a school teacher, who received a bachelor's degree in clinical psychology from the University of Texas and who almost got a master's degree (three credits short); she also attended business school. At some point, she moved to The Bronx, presumably while studying business.\n\nHowever, Karen states that she bought Rosario from Rosario's parents, and another comment made by Jack states that Karen smuggles staff in from Latin America, namely Mexico, and probably El Salvador as well. While there, she also performed with a then-unknown Jennifer Lopez, including a production of \"Tea for Two\" at the Shalom Retirement Center. At some point, she was also paid to tape pornographic videos for Tommy Lee.\n\nOne of Rosario's brothers is a political prisoner, and remarks made by Karen suggests she has children, possibly still in El Salvador.\n\nAlthough she had been mentioned by Karen since the pilot episode, Rosario's first appearance was in the season-one finale, \"Object of My Rejection.\" Due to Karen's patronizing tone, we're made to think she doesn't speak English well. Rosario actually speaks English fluently albeit with a thick accent, but is an illegal alien.\n\nTo keep her in the country, Karen has her marry Jack McFarland, her gay friend, to get her green card. The marriage was later terminated at the end of season two, when Rosario asked for a divorce to pursue other romantic interests. However, she maintained a close relationship with Jack after (often echoing hers with Karen) and claimed to still think of him as family.\n\nRosario was one of few people with whom Stan remained in contact after he faked his death (at the end of season five). When Karen learned that Rosario had kept this news from her (in season eight), she fired her. Rosario worked as a bar attendant until Karen took her back.\n\nDuring a live episode, it is revealed by Karen that Rosario earns $350,000 per year.\n\nIn the show's series finale, Rosario was shown to have lived with Karen and Jack in the years after the show ended, growing older with them and possibly still working for them despite being in a wheelchair (though she states that she is only in the wheelchair due to a sprained ankle).\n\nRosario is usually seen wearing a Members Only jacket over her maid's uniform. She has a particular fondness for Subway sandwiches.\n\nMorrison was a guest star in the first two seasons, but from season three until the eighth season, she was credited as a main cast member in the episodes she appeared.\n\nIn the series revival in 2017, Rosario is an unseen character, referred to but never appearing. Morrison had declined to reprise her role, having retired from acting. The character was written out of the show in the episode \"Rosario's Quinceañera\", in which Rosario dies of a heart attack off screen.\n\nIn 1985, Rosario met Karen Walker at a club, while working as a cigarette lady, and went to work for her as a maid, which was where she was working when the series began in 1998. Rosario and Karen are very close, but their relationship is love-hate. They are notorious for swapping insults back and forth. Rosario is just as feisty as Karen, and is one of the few people that can go toe-to-toe with her.\n\nIn earlier episodes, they often yell and argue with each other at the same time. However, many of those fights end with an emotional embrace or light-hearted exchange between the two, which makes it clear that they really do care about each other. Examples of this include the season 3 episode \"My Uncle, The Car,\" where Karen becomes sad at almost losing Rosario in a bet to her rival Beverley Leslie, and the season 7 episode \"Partners,\" where Karen ignores the plight of a very sick Rosario because she is afraid of losing her. Rosario also mentions in season 4's \"The Third Wheel Gets The Grace\" that, for their 15-year anniversary, all she wanted to do was spend time with Karen.\n\nWhen Rosario dies in the series revival, Karen arranges the funeral, giving Rosario the quinceañera she never had. She bolts out of the funeral before it starts, however, drowning her sorrows at a bar, unable to handle the loss of her friend. She later comes back to the church to sit next to the casket and say goodbye, admitting with rare emotion that Rosario was her best friend, her \"sparring partner\", and her \"everything\".\n"}
{"id": "2015426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015426", "title": "University of New Hampshire at Manchester", "text": "University of New Hampshire at Manchester\n\nThe University of New Hampshire at Manchester (UNH Manchester) is the urban campus of the public University of New Hampshire and is located in Manchester, New Hampshire. It was established in 1985 as the sixth college of the University of New Hampshire. Other colleges within UNH include the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Life Sciences and Agriculture, the Thompson School of Applied Science, the College of Health and Human Services, the Peter T. Paul College of Business and Economics, and the School of Law. Students graduating from the university's urban campus join the more than 130,000 alumni of the University of New Hampshire.\n\nAs of March 2015, the University of New Hampshire's campus in Manchester is located in the Pandora Mill at 88 Commercial Street, on the banks of the Merrimack River in Manchester's historic Amoskeag Millyard. The move to 88 Commercial Street increased the physical plant of the college by almost 50%, as from 2001 to 2014 the school was located in the University Center building at 400 Commercial Street.\n\nDue to its location in the heart of Manchester, the largest city in northern New England, UNH Manchester is within a 30-minute drive of more than half of New Hampshire's population. Many of the college's students commute to campus from towns inside the Manchester-Nashua metro area, which as of 2013 had a total population of 403,895. Manchester itself has a city population of 110,378 (2013) and an urban area population of 158,377 (2013). Home to ten colleges and universities and more than 10,000 post-secondary students, Manchester was rated, in 2015, one of the \"Five Coolest College Towns in New England\" by \"Campus News\".\n\nNationally, Manchester ranks thirteenth on a list of the best cities in America to live and launch a business in (\"CNN Money\"); second in tax-friendliness (\"Kiplinger\"); first on a list of the cheapest places to live (\"Forbes\"); seventh in upward income mobility (\"Business Insider\"); eighth in the best cities for tech jobs (\"Fast Company\"); and second in the overall happiness of its citizens (\"Men's Health\"). Overall, New Hampshire ranks ninth in the U.S. in high-tech employment concentration, with most of these jobs located in Manchester and its immediate environs.\n\nIn recent years the Amoskeag Millyard and its residential historic district have experienced continual redevelopment. Many properties originally built in the nineteenth century as tenement housing for mill workers have been retro-fitted to create stylish and eclectic residential condominiums, retail stores, and restaurants. The Pandora Mill is one such converted mill building, situated between the Merrimack and a large cluster of new developments. Elm Street, a block to the east, is the commercial center of the city and northern New England.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire's urban campus provides associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees, with a special emphasis on programs that address urban issues and integrate undergraduate and graduate study with Manchester's thriving professional and business communities.\n\nIn addition to its wide range of academic and non-academic community outreach programs, the campus has a collaborative agreement with the neighboring New Hampshire Institute of Art that allows students interested in the fine arts to enroll in the Institute's Bachelor of Fine Arts program. The campus also has an articulation agreement with the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences that allows students to dual enroll in the pre-pharmacy or physician assistant programs offered at the latter's Manchester location. UNHM has also established a partnership with the Institute at Palazzo Rucellai in Florence, Italy, which allows students in the former's Politics and Society program to study abroad. UNHM also provides valuable student resources, such as workshops and tutoring, through its Center for Academic Enrichment.\n\nThe student-faculty ratio at the university's urban campus is 13:1, and 97% of classes have fewer than 30 students. While the College has always attracted a significant cohort of non-traditional students, in recent years the demographics of the student body in Manchester have shifted considerably. In 2006, 59% of students were between the ages of 17 and 23, with 41% 24 or older; by 2013, only 34% of students were 24 or older, with 66% of the student body between the ages of 17 and 23.\n\nCritical to the academic mission of the University of New Hampshire's campus in Manchester is emphasizing student learning in and out of the classroom, particularly in the STEM fields. A significant percentage of the 1,000 students studying at the urban campus secure for-credit internships in the Manchester business community, often in STEM-oriented companies, and the college in turn offers use of the UNH STEM Discovery Lab to members of the local community, particularly K-12 students and their teachers. UNHM Community Outreach Scholarship further serves the Manchester community by maintaining a massive data archive relating to the City of Manchester and its public policy initiatives. This archive is an official part of the UNH Dimond Library Digital Collections Initiative.\n\nStudents can take advantage of opportunities to study outside of the United States through UNH-managed programs such as the Florence Summer Program, UNH exchange programs, or UNH-approved programs. The National Student Exchange also allows a student to take a semester at a public college or university anywhere in the United States or its territories.\n\nOrdinarily, as a college of the University of New Hampshire, UNHM is not ranked by media outlets as a discrete institution. However, in 2013 \"Washington Monthly\" ranked UNH's urban college #14 in the United States in an assessment of best-value liberal arts colleges. In 2014, \"Money\", a publication of \"Time Magazine\", ranked UNH Manchester #231 out of all colleges and universities in the United States in an assessment of educational quality, affordability, and career outcomes. The undergraduate colleges of UNH located in Durham ranked #261 in the \"Money\" assessment.\n\nIn 2012, UNH Dining, which services the UNH colleges in both Manchester and Durham, was ranked in the top 50 nationally by \"The Daily Meal\", whose \"Best Colleges for Food in America\" listing rates universities' dining options on accessibility, service, healthiness, sustainability, and use of local products.\n\nWhile many UNHM students commute to campus from towns in the greater Manchester area, UNH Manchester announced the opening of a new UNH residence hall in fall 2018.\n\nLocated at 1000 Elm Street, UNH Downtown Commons offers double and triple rooms, on-site dining, laundry facilities, and other amenities. The residence hall is a 14-minute walk to campus, and steps from downtown Manchester’s restaurants, shops and nightlife.\n\nUNH Manchester also partners with the New Hampshire Institute of Art to offer meals in the NHIA dining hall, located on Spring Street.\n\nStudents at UNHM participate in many student-led academic, recreational, and special-interest clubs.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire's athletic program consists of 18 NCAA programs, all of which play at the Durham campus of the university. However, Manchester does on occasion host home games of the UNH men's ice hockey team. Games are held at SNHU Arena, a few blocks from the UNH Manchester campus, with a seating capacity of 11,770 (9,852 for ice hockey). SNHU Arena has also hosted other college and professional teams, such as the NCAA Frozen Four Tournament and the Manchester Monarchs hockey teams.\n\n\"Millworks\" and \"Campus Connections\" tell the UNH Manchester story and connect students and other members of the UNHM community to the campus. Both publications are coordinated by the UNHM Marketing and Community Relations Office, and feature articles on student achievements, faculty research, and community partnerships.\n\nManchester is home to the New Hampshire Fisher Cats, the Double-A affiliate of Major League Baseball's Toronto Blue Jays. The Fisher Cats play home games at Northeast Delta Dental Stadium, a 7,722-seat venue approximately a half-mile from UNH Manchester. Other local attractions include the historic Palace Theater, the Currier Museum of Art, the New Hampshire Institute of Art, and the SEE Science Center, an interactive learning facility adjacent to the UNH Manchester campus.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire's Manchester campus connects the research and knowledge of students, faculty, and staff with the local community through public programs and events. The UNHM Speaker's Bureau runs a lecture series that pairs researchers at UNHM with academic partners like middle schools, high schools, and community colleges. Through the Bureau, campus faculty and students share, free of charge, their disciplinary expertise and research experience in the STEM fields, the social sciences, and the humanities. In addition, the campus sponsors films, book clubs, brown-bag luncheon lectures, the Sidore lecture series, and Music in the Mills (an initiative supported by the Frederick Smyth Foundation) to provide those living in and around Manchester with an opportunity to learn and discover.\n"}
{"id": "2015427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015427", "title": "Dysplastic nevus syndrome", "text": "Dysplastic nevus syndrome\n\nDysplastic nevus syndrome, also known as familial atypical multiple mole–melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome, is an inherited cutaneous condition described in certain families, and characterized by unusual nevi and multiple inherited melanomas. First described in 1820, the condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and caused by mutations in the CDKN2A gene. In addition to melanoma, individuals with the condition are at increased risk for pancreatic cancer. \n\nThe diagnosis of dysplastic nevus syndrome is based on clinical presentation and family history. Treatment consists of resection of malignant skin lesions (melanoma). Screening for pancreatic cancer may be considered, particularly if there is a family history.\n\nDysplastic nevus syndrome is characterized by unusual nevi and multiple inherited melanomas.\n\nThe CDKN2A gene is located on chromosome 9p21.3. Two main transcripts, isoforms '1' and '4', each contain three exons and span 7288 and 26740 bp, respectively. They encode proteins of 156 and 173 amino acids; isoform '1' encodes p16(INK4a), while isoform '4' encodes p14(ARF), a protein that is structurally unrelated to p16(INK4) but acts in cell cycle G1 control by stabilizing the tumor suppressor protein p53.\n\nDysplastic nevus syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The penetrance for melanoma in kindreds with CDKN2A mutations is estimated at 58% to 92% by 80 years of age and varies with geography. The penetrance in CDKN2A mutation carriers for pancreatic cancer has been estimated to be 17% by 75 years of age. As noted above, there is wide variation in published estimates of the penetrance of CDKN2A mutations.\n\nThe histopathologic characteristics of melanoma in FAMMM kindreds are not different from those seen in sporadic cases of melanoma and, thus, are not useful in diagnosing the syndrome. Superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) and nodular melanoma are the most frequently encountered histological melanoma subtypes in patients with CDKN2A mutations, which is consistent with the relative early age of onset.\n\nFAMMM has been described by multiple authors and institutions, and various definitions have been adopted. According to Newton et al., a scoring system allotting one point per feature establishes FAMMM with scores greater than or equal to 3. The features include: 1) two or more clinically atypical nevi, 2) more than 100 nevi in patients between 20 and 50 years of age, 3) more than 50 nevi in patients under 20 years of age or more than 50 years of age, 4) more than one nevus in buttocks or instep, 5) nevi on the anterior scalp, 6) one or more pigmented lesions in the iris.\n\nThe Classical (1990) definition uses the following criteria: 1) 100 or more melanocytic nevi, 2) one or more melanocytic nevi greater than or equal to 8mm in its largest diameter, and 3) one or more clinically atypical melanocytic nevi.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus 1992 definition, which is still controversial, requires a family history of melanoma, in addition to a large number of melanocytic nevi (often greater than 50) and melanocytic nevi that present certain histological features.\n\nScreening for melanoma in FAMMM kindreds should begin at age 10 with a baseline total body skin examination including scalp, eyes, oral mucosa, genital area, and nail, as family members may develop melanoma in their early teens. Monthly self-performed skin examinations and early referral to a dermatologist for monitoring are recommended interventions. \n\nTreatment approaches such as removal of the largest dysplastic nevus or all of the dysplastic nevi have not been shown to appreciably reduce the risk of developing melanoma and are not cost-effective; therefore, these approaches are not recommended. Similarly, biopsy of multiple pigmented dysplastic nevi is not recommended and biopsy should be limited to specific nevi with appearance concerning for melanoma. \n\nAt Mayo Clinic, FAMMM patients with a confirmed mutation and family history of pancreatic cancer are offered screening with either high-resolution pancreatic protocol CT, MRI, or endoscopic ultrasound starting at age 50 or 10 years younger than the earliest family member with pancreas cancer. They are counseled on the lack of evidence-based data to support screening, and on the limitations of our current technology to detect a lesion at a stage amenable to therapy.\n\nIn 1820 Norris reported the first case of what is now recognized as FAMMM (12). He described a 59-year-old man with melanoma, a high total body mole count, and family history of the same.\n\n\n"}

However, it lacks a wall behind the stands so that natural air comes into the field. This makes it possible for home runs to leave the stadium, something not possible in typical domed stadiums.\n\nThe stadium was built in 1979 without the roof and named as the new home field of the Lions that moved from Fukuoka to Tokorozawa that year. The installation of the roof took place in two phases: the first phase after the 1997 season, and the second phase after the 1998 seasons. At the beginning of the 1998 season, the stadium was renamed Seibu Dome although the domed roof had not completed yet.\n\nOn March 1, 2005, the stadium was named as Invoice Inc. bought the naming rights of the stadium for the next two seasons.\nUpon expiration of the previous contract, on January 1, 2007, the name was changed again to to reflect the sponsorship of Goodwill Group, Inc. The naming rights contract with Goodwill was intended to remain in effect for five years. On January 16, 2017, MetLife, a New York City-based financial institution, purchased naming rights for five years. . \n\nAlthough Seibu Dome was still the official name of the stadium, the stadium and media used the sponsored name almost exclusively during this period. However, at the end of 2007, as both the stadium and minor team naming right of Goodwill were seized due to Goodwill's illegal business movements, the Dome's name was restored to Seibu Dome in 2008.\n\nThe stadium is located in front of Seibukyūjō-mae Station, the terminal station of the Seibu Sayama Line railway (a branch of the Seibu Ikebukuro Line connecting Tokorozawa with Tokyo) and the Seibu Yamaguchi Line people mover. Both lines are operated by Seibu Railway, the owner of the stadium and the Lions.\n\nQueen performed at the arena for their Hot Space Tour in 1982.

{"id": "2015430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015430", "title": "Cave of the Winds (Colorado)", "text": "Cave of the Winds (Colorado)\n\nCave of the Winds is a cave in the Pikes Peak region of Colorado. It is located just west of Colorado Springs on U.S. Highway 24, near the Manitou Cliff Dwellings. Tours of the complex of caves are given daily.\n\nBy far the most famous section of the Cave of the Winds is the Silent Splendor room. Discovered in 1984, the room contains numerous rare crystalline speleothems including helectites which appear to defy the laws of gravity by growing in strange directions and not being forced down by gravity like many cave formations. . Unfortunately, the room must be sealed off from the general public in order to maintain its delicate environment. Silent Splendor is sealed from public view by an \"environmental gate\" with a large tube that seals in moisture to maintain the atmosphere necessary for the delicate formations to continue to grow.\n\nIn the late 1980s a few new passages were opened inside the cavern. On May 8, 1988, Mother's Day, a chamber called the \"Adventure Room\" was opened. Left in a more natural state than most of the cave, the Adventure Room has dirt floors, lower numbers of lights (compared to other chambers inside the cave) and gives entry to the Manitou Grand Caverns where Lantern Tours are given.\n\nIn 1989, a new passage named \"Old Curiosity Shop\" was opened, billed as the most narrow passage in the Cave of the Winds. Traversing it gains a look at the \"Colorado Rose\", a beaded helectite, and \"Spider Web Valley\", a collection of delicate helectites. This passage was opened to make tour groups moving through \"\"Tall Man's Headache, Fat Man's Misery\"\" a little easier.\n\nOther lesser known attractions include a \"bottomless pit,\" often the scene of practical jokes by the guides. The site also features a free-fall amusement ride called the Terror-Dactyl.\n\nIt is believed that both Apache and Ute Native Americans knew about the cave. The name, Cave of the Winds, relates to a legend involving the Apache, who were said to believe the cave was the home of a Great Spirit of the Wind. The first documented mention of the cave came in 1880 when two brothers, John and George Pickett, discovered the cave during a hike in Williams Canyon led by the Rev. Roselle T. Cross, pastor of the Congregational Church in Colorado Springs. The boys noticed that their candles flickered in a small shelter cave they had found and wind was seen to be blowing from a nearby crevice. Crawling through the opening they emerged into a large chamber. Within a few days Cross wrote about the discovery of the cave in his church newsletter and his story was immediately reprinted in the \"Colorado Springs Gazette\" of July 2, 1880. The \"Colorado Encyclopedia\" relates: \"Although Cross exaggerated the heights and depths of vertical elements, as do most inexperienced cavers, his account is remarkably free of the florid Victorian hyperbole typical of most cave descriptions of that time. Cross and his Boys’ Exploring Association explored most of the horizontal passages accessible from the original entrance, a distance of about 200 feet—a respectable distance for schoolboys using candles.\"\n\nIn 1880, the same year that the cave was discovered, George Washington Snider, a stonecutter from Ohio who had traveled to Colorado seeking his fortune visited the cave. Snider excavated passages from the Williams Canyon caves, as they were then called, and discovered \"Canopy Hall\" -- a large room nearly 200 feet long containing thousands of stalactites and stalagmites.. Snider wrote, “It was as though Aladdin with his wonderful lamp had effected the magic result.\" Unfortunately Snider spoke of his discovery in town and the next day the cave was mobbed by townspeople who \nstripped the cavern of many of the stalactites.\n\nSnider continued to excavate and began preparations for guided tours. The Cave of the Winds quickly became one of the established attractions of the young Manitou resort area. Cave of the Winds has been in continuous operation since 1881 – making it one of Colorado’s oldest visitor attractions. Electrical lights were added in 1907, and visitors began traveling to the cave in even greater numbers – first by carriage and railroad, and later by car.\n\nAbout 500 million years ago during the Ordovician period warm shallow seas covered the Pikes Peak region of Colorado. The seas were home to abundant shell creatures that accumulated on the sea floor when they died. The layers built up for millions of years and were eventually compacted and hardened into the rock known as limestone. The geological name for the limestone layer found in the cave is Manitou Limestone. \n\nAbout 70 million years ago the shallow seas receded and the area was lifted forming the Rocky Mountain region. About 4 to 7 million years ago the limestone fell below the water table Rainwater mixed with carbon dioxide, forming a weak carbonic acid that slowly ate away at the limestone, forming pockets. The pockets slowly enlarged forming passageways and caverns.\n\nIn the short steep drive up Williams Canyon to the cave entrance one can view several different depositions of limestone. During the Devonian period the Williams Canyon Limestone was laid down and during the Mississippian period the Leadville Limestone layer was deposited.\n\nAs the water table dropped within the cave system air began to fill the passageways and caverns. Stalactites formed on the cave's ceilings as calcium carbonate-rich water dripped leaving thin calcite rings that grew into icicle-like shapes over thousands of years. Through the same process stalagmites grew from the cave floors. A third type of structure is called flowstone. Flowstone formations are curtain-like formations that flow along the sides of caverns or passages. They are the most common formation found in \"solution caves\" in limestone, such as Cave of the Winds. Sometimes called draperies or curtains, they are formed over thousands of years as the mineral-rich water flows over surfaces leaving calcite behind.\n\nThe rarest and most delicate formations are called helictites. Helictite forms have been described in several shapes: \"hands\", ribbon helictites, saws, rods, butterflies, curly-fries, and \"clumps of worms\". They can be easily broken by the slightest touch and consequently are set away from tour groups. As helictites grow they change their axis from the vertical at one or more stages of growth, hence the \"clumps of worms\" discription for one type. Several theories as to how and why they defy gravity have been suggested but no theory has yet been proven to be correct.\n\n\n"}

The composer wrote the libretto, which is based on Nikolai Gogol's short story of the same name, from his early (1832) collection of Ukrainian stories \"Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka\". The opera remained unfinished and unperformed at Mussorgsky's death in 1881.\n\nMussorgsky worked on the opera between 1874 and 1880, in competition with his work on \"Khovanshchina\" (1872–1880); both were incomplete at the time of his death in 1881. He reused some music that he had written previously (such as the \"Market Scene\" from Act II of the ill-fated \"Mlada\" of 1872, used for the opening scene of \"Fair\"). Incorporation of the music of \"Night on Bald Mountain\" as a dream sequence involving the hero was a late addition to the scenario in the course of composition, despite the fact that such an episode is not suggested by the original story. Although Mussorgsky managed to complete some numbers and even some of the orchestration, significant portions of the scenario were left only in bare sketches, or without any music at all.\n\nSeveral subsequent composers and editors (cited below) played partial or maximal roles in bringing the work into a performable state. The first staged performance, with spoken sections, occurred on 8 October 1913 in Moscow under Konstantin Saradzhev. Beginning in 1917, the first of several fully-sung versions reached the stage.\n\nCompleted versions of the opera took place as follows:\n\nThe opera was first performed in England on 24 November 1936 by the British Music Drama Opera Company at Covent Garden, staged by Vladimir Rosing, with Albert Coates conducting.\n\n\"The Fair at Sorochyntsi\" is not a part of the standard operatic repertoire in the West. The best-known numbers from \"Fair\" are the orchestral Introduction and the closing Gopak. Mussorgsky also arranged the Gopak and the market scene for piano solo.\n\nSergei Rachmaninoff made an arrangement of the Gopak for piano.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov's version of \"Night on Bald Mountain\" is based mainly on the version included in this opera.\n\nTwo of the Ukrainian folk tunes that Mussorgsky incorporated into this opera (Act 1) were used also by Rimsky-Korsakov in his own \"Christmas Eve\", which was likewise based on a story by Gogol.\n\nSource:\n\n\"Note\": The Shebalin edition incorporates the \"Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad\" ().\n\n\"Scene 1: The Fair\"\n\nMerchants peddle their wares to crowds of visitors arriving from all around. The Gypsy makes reference to a red jacket that the devil is looking for, while the lad Gritsko woos Parasya. Her father, Cherevik, at first is indignant at this forwardness, but, after realizing that Gritsko is the son of a close friend, he agrees to let Gritsko marry his daughter. The two men go into the tavern to celebrate, as evening settles and the people disperse.\n\nCherevik and his buddy, Kum, comes out of the tavern in a drunken state. After they wander around in the dark, Khrivya, Cherevik's wife, comes out of their house, and he announces Parasya's engagement. But Khivrya objects, and, while Gritsko overhears, drunken Cherevik concedes that the wedding will not happen. Gritsko, alone, bemoans his sadness. The Gypsy enters, and the two make a pact: Gritsko will give the Gypsy his oxen for fifteen rubles if the latter can make Cherevik change his mind.\n\n\"Scene 2: Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad (Intermezzo)\"\n\nAlone, Gritsko falls asleep and has a dream involving witches and devils. They are dispelled by church bells.\n\n\"Kum's Hut\"\n\nInside Kum's house, where they are lodging, Khivrya quarrels with Cherevik, getting him to leave, so that she may keep her secret rendezvous with Afanasy Ivanovich, the son of the village priest. When the latter arrives, she offers him her culinary delicacies, which he devours. In the midst of their amorous encounter a knock is heard at the door. Afanasy hides on a shelf, and in walk Cherevik and Kum, with friends, alarmed by a rumor that someone has seen the red jacket and the devil. Kum tells the full story of the red jacket, concluding with the remark that the devil appears every year at the fair with a pig's face, looking for the red jacket. Suddenly a pig's snout is seen in the window, and everyone runs about in confusion.\n\n\"Scene 1: The Street before Kum's Hut\"\n\nOn a street, as a result of the superstitious confusion of the previous scene, Cherevik and Kum are being chased by the Gypsy and some lads. The latter accuse the two older men of stealing a mare, and tie them up. Gritsko enters, extracting a promise from Cherevik to have the wedding to Parasya the next day, and the two older men are released.\n\n\"Scene 2: The Street before Kum's Hut\"\n\nOn a street in front of Kum's house, Parasya at first is sad about Gritsko, but then cheers herself up with a little hopak, in which Cherevik joins without her noticing. Kum and Gritsko enter, and Cherevik blesses the two lovers, only to be met by Khivrya's rage, which prompts the Gypsy to call on the lads to restrain her. The people celebrate the wedding with a hopak.\n\n\nIn 1881 Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov suggested that Anatoly Lyadov finish the composition of the work, the libretto to be completed by Mussorgsky's old friend Arseny Golenishchev-Kutuzov. However, Lyadov orchestrated only five numbers (published in 1904) and did not finish the opera. Vyacheslav Karatygin later edited some fragments of Mussorgsky's manuscripts, which were orchestrated by Lyadov and performed in 1911. The next year Vladimir Senilov published his orchestration of Parasya's dumka from Act III. Yury Sakhnovsky edited and orchestrated some fragments which, together with material edited by Lyadov, Karatygin, and Rimsky-Korsakov (i.e., the \"Night on Bald Mountain\" music) constituted a staged \"premiere\" of sorts, performed at the Moscow Free Theatre on 8 October 1913 (Old Style), with spoken dialogue inserted for scenes without music by Mussorgsky.\n\nIn commemoration of his late comrade from The Five, César Cui became the first to create a complete version of \"The Fair at Sorochyntsi\" during 1914–1916. This fully sung version – but without the \"Night on Bald Mountain\" sequence – was staged on 13 October 1917 (Old Style) at the Theatre of Musical Drama in Petrograd. The foreword to Cui's edition, dated October 1916, explains the state of affairs at the time, and translates thus:\n\nHowever, Cui's version failed to find a permanent place in the repertory, and the opera was completed and orchestrated again by Nikolai Tcherepnin in 1923 and by Vissarion Shebalin in 1930. Shebalin's version became the standard since then. This also includes the \"Night on Bald Mountain\" as a prelude to the third act, instead of an interlude in act one (following Gritsko's Dumka), as Mussorgsky originally planned.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2015445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015445", "title": "Jinpachi Mishima", "text": "Jinpachi Mishima\n\nJinpachi Mishima was the original founder of the Mishima Zaibatsu and the father of Heihachi, father-in-law of Kazumi, paternal grandfather of Kazuya and Lars Alexandersson, adoptive paternal grandfather of Lee Chaolan and paternal great-grandfather of Jin Kazama. Unlike most Mishima (who were ruthless and power hungry), Jinpachi was a man of honor and wisdom as he showed compassion to his grandson Kazuya when the latter was a child (this is possibly another reason Heihachi resented Jinpachi so much) and was friends with Wang Jinrei. However, Jinpachi's life took a turn for the worse when the greedy Heihachi staged a coup d'état and stole the company from him. Jinpachi attempted to retake the company when Heihachi entered the military industry, but failed and was imprisoned underneath a Mishima compound, Hon-Maru. He died due to starvation after some years. Before his debut, Jinpachi never makes an appearance, although his existence is hinted multiple times, as his friend, Wang's participation in the second tournament is motivated by Jinpachi's wish, and his gravestone is also shown in Wang's ending in \"Tekken 2\". \n\nIn \"Tekken 5\", having been resurrected and taken over by a demon as well as granted incredible supernatural powers, Jinpachi breaks out of Honmaru when the temple is destroyed during a battle between Heihachi, Kazuya and an army of Jack-4s sent to kill Heihachi in which the Jacks explode, pulverazing the Hon-maru and freeing Jinpachi from his underground prison. With the news of Heihachi's apparent demise, Jinpachi takes over the company from behind the scenes and organizes the fifth King of Iron Fist Tournament under the orders of the demon, that told him to destroy the world and seek out the souls of the strong, even though he wanted to refuse this command, he obeyed due of lack of energy. \n\nIn the tournament finals, Jinpachi is confronted by his great-grandson, Jin Kazama, who defeats him and puts him to rest at last. Though not playable, Jinpachi briefly appears in the Scenario Campaign prologue of \"Tekken 6\", which retells the events from previous games in a comic book-style format, and he is also mentioned in the prologues and epilogues of several characters, such as Jin and Wang.\n\nHe returns in \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\" as a playable character and as one of the Stage 7 sub-bosses, alongside Heihachi. He reprises his role as one of the unplayable Stage 7 sub-bosses in \"Tekken Revolution\". In \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", Dhalsim's Swap Costume is based on Jinpachi's appearance.\n\nJinpachi is as a tall, muscular old man with a long beard and hair similar to his son, Heihachi, albeit much longer. He is one of the oldest human characters in the \"Tekken\" series, being around the same age as his friend, Wang Jinrei, who is about 102 years old in \"Tekken 5\", the game Jinpachi debuted in. He wears a large golden necklace, a pair of golden bracelets on his arms and legs and a cloak pants. In his devil form in \"Tekken 5\", Jinpachi has a purple aura around him, his height slightly increases, his skin becomes dark purple, his eyes glow yellow, and his necklace and bracelets disappear. He also gains spikes on his elbows, two spiked humps on his back and a large mouth on his stomach, from which he shoot fireballs. \n\nIn his alternate devil form in \"Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection\", instead of purple aura and skin, Jinpachi has a flaming aura, his skin is dark brown and yellow, and lava-like substance sprouts from all over his body. Although he still has the spikes and mouth from his original devil form, his face is now almost unrecognizable, he loses his beard and hair in exchange for a flaming spike, and his eyes are fiery white with no pupils instead of merely glowing yellow.\n\nOriginally Jinpachi was supposed to be the origin of the Mishima curse, the Devil gene, proven by his in-game appearance with Devil traits, his ending text in which it says \"\"Jinpachi's mind is consumed by the Devil\"\" and Devil Jin's interlude with Jinpachi has them talk about Devil, as well Devil Jin's ending sharing elements from Kazuya's ending from Tekken 4, in which Devil Jin turns in Devil after absorbing Jinpachi's demon similarly to Kazuya turning into Devil after absorbing Jin's Devil.\n\nJinpachi's gameplay is similar to the other Mishima characters, which involves many fast attacks and juggles. He shares many moves with Heihachi and Kazuya, including the iconic Electric Wind God Fist move; however, his executions of several moves range from having little to vast differences than both of them. In his unplayable \"Tekken 5\" appearance, Jinpachi has an array of unblockable moves, one of which is a fireball attack that Jinpachi fires from the mouth of his abdomen. The fireball has a very long range and can deplete more than half of the player's health; the best way to avoid the fireballs is through sidestepping, although it can be avoided by other means depending on the character, such as by using Xiaoyu's somersault move or Steve's dodges and sways. Another of his unblockable move is an ability to disrupt an opponent by stunning their motion, which hits the opponent at every range regardless of them being on the ground or airborne. This move leaves the opponent open to any attack Jinpachi decides to throw at them. Jinpachi also has a move in which he absorbs a small part of his opponent's health, as well as a teleporting move that temporarily makes him unable to be hit while doing so. While his boss appearance in \"Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection\" is mostly the same as \"Tekken 5\", his playable appearance in the PS3 version tones him down considerably as he is slower, weaker, and has a minuscule movelist compared to other characters.\n\nIn \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\", Jinpachi's moveset is drastically altered to balance him as a playable character. He loses many of his unblockable moves like the stun attack and health absorption, and his fireballs do a lot less damage than it did before; in return, he gains a variety of new moves, including properly using his teleportation move as a stance than can be chained to other attacks. He also has new stances, such as the ability to fly.\n\nThough Jinpachi does not appear in the \"2010 film\", he is mentioned (though not by name) as having been imprisoned and murdered by Heihachi (who had a similar personality in this film) many years prior to the film's events.\n\n\"Nintendo Power\" listed Jinpachi Mishima as having one of the best mustaches in video games. In 2010, \"Complex\" ranked Jinpachi as the \"37th lamest video game boss, commenting \"His attacks did huge damage, and his moves were faster than most jabs—because we were unable to unlock him as a playable character without cheating.\" That same year, \"Complex\" placed Jinpachi's stomach-mouth 6th in their list of the craziest moments in the \"Tekken\" series. GamesRadar listed a matchup between Jinpachi and Gouken as one of their \"12 matchups we want to see in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\"\", claiming \"Roided out Rumble in the retirement home!\". VentureBeat placed Jinpachi at 2nd place in their list \"5 Fighting-Game Bosses Cheaper Than SF4′s Seth\", commenting \"He possesses an unblockable fireball that takes out half your lifebar, along with teleports, stun thrusts, and a bear hug that gives him many ways to punish button-mashing.\" Den of Geek ranked Jinpachi as the \"20 greatest Tekken character\", stating \"as a straight-up boss, nobody feels larger-than-life and threatening than this demonic would-be world-breaker.\"\n"}

A rock fall closed the tour in 1920. It officially reopened in 1924, bringing visitors to the front of the Bridal Veil instead of behind it, on a series of decks and walkways. Tropical storm-like conditions can be experienced, as winds can reach up to 68 mph underneath the falls.

{"id": "2015449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015449", "title": "Hugh Lane", "text": "Hugh Lane\n\nSir Hugh Percy Lane (9 November 1875 – 7 May 1915) was an Irish art dealer, collector and gallery director. He is best known for establishing Dublin's Municipal Gallery of Modern Art (the first known public gallery of modern art in the world) and for his contribution to the visual arts in Ireland, including the Lane Bequest. Hugh Lane died on board the RMS \"Lusitania\".\n\nHugh Percy Lane was born in County Cork, Ireland, on 9 November 1875. He was the son of a rector father, and his mother Adelaide was a daughter of Dudley Persse, of Roxburgh, Co Galway and her sister was the dramatist Augusta, Lady Gregory of Coole, Co Galway.\n\nHe was brought up in Cornwall, England, and began his career as an apprentice painting restorer with Martin Henry Colnaghi in London, then worked as an art dealer at the Colnaghi's Marlborough Gallery for some years, before becoming a dealer in his own right and opening a gallery in Dublin in 1908.\n\nThrough regular visits to Coole (near Gort), County Galway, the home of his aunt, Lady Gregory, Lane remained in contact with Ireland. He soon counted among his family, friends and social circle those who collectively formed the core of the Irish cultural renaissance in the early decades of the 20th century that was a part of the Celtic Revival.\n\nExtolling the cause of Irish art abroad, Lane also became one of the foremost collectors and dealers of French Impressionist paintings in Europe, and amongst those works purchased by him for the new gallery were \"La Musique aux Tuileries\" by Manet, \"Sur la Plage\" by Degas, \"Les Parapluies\" by Renoir and \"La Cheminée\" by Vuillard. For his \"services to art\" in Ireland, Lane was knighted in June 1909 at the comparatively young age of 33.\n\nThe Municipal Gallery of Modern Art opened in January 1908 in temporary premises at 17 Harcourt Street, Dublin, with no entrance charge. Lane hoped that Dublin Corporation would run it, but the corporation was unsure if it would be financially viable. Lane met the running costs, while seeking a more permanent home. A new gallery was proposed in St Stephens Green, and then a dramatic bridge-gallery over the River Liffey, both designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. Both were turned down, the latter by a close vote of the Corporation, which would have to meet the long-term running costs. Despairing of Irish support, after all he had done, Sir Hugh then bequeathed his pictures to the National Gallery in London. Shortly before his death Lane reversed this in a codicil to his will, that was however, unwitnessed. \n\nLane did not live to see his gallery permanently located as he died in 1915 during the sinking of the RMS \"Lusitania\", off the west coast of Cork, the county of his birth.\nJust fourteen months before his death, in March, 1914, Lane had been appointed Director of the National Gallery of Ireland.\n\nThe Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, extended in 2005, is now in Parnell Square in central Dublin.\n\nA drama-documentary on him, \"Citizen Lane\", directed by Thaddeus O'Sullivan, was produced in 2018.\n\nFollowing his death, Lane's will bequeathed his collection to London, but an unwitnessed later codicil bequeathed it to Dublin. Having possession, London's National Gallery did not recognise the codicil. Altering this legal reality became the life's work of Professor Thomas Bodkin. At the request of Lane's aunt, Lady Gregory, WT Cosgrave, leader of the Irish Government unsuccessfully approached Ramsay MacDonald on the matter in 1929.\n\nThen, in 1938, the present-day solution came from the British side, during the House of Lords debates on the Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938. Lord Strabolgi put forward a suggestion from Sir Robert Witt: \"..that these pictures should alternate between London and Dublin. We have had them in London for a considerable number of years, and it might now be the turn of the Dublin Galleries to have them for a number of years... Legally, the holders have a very strong case, but we are so wealthy in our treasures, while Ireland is so comparatively poor...\"\n\nLord Marley added: \"My Lords, perhaps I might say one word in support of what my noble friend Lord Strabolgi has said because Sir Hugh Lane was a cousin of mine, and I do know he was very anxious, even before this codicil was made, that the pictures should go to Dublin. I hope that something will be done in support of what my noble friend has said.\"\n\nWhen John A. Costello became Taoiseach in 1948, he initiated further negotiations with the UK government. Support in London was maintained in 1953 by Lord Moyne, who said in Parliament: \".. I would urge on Her Majesty's Government to include in it a provision for the return of the thirty-six, or so, pictures which were collected by the late Sir Hugh Lane as a basis for a modern collection for Ireland ...\"\n\nThese interventions eventually led on to a compromise agreement in 1959, announced by Taoiseach Sean Lemass, whereby half of the Lane Bequest would be lent and shown in Dublin every five years. In his announcement of the agreement, Lemass thanked the then-retired Thomas Bodkin for his persistence, helped by Lord Moyne and Lord Pakenham. In 1993, the agreement was changed so that 31 of the 39 paintings would stay in Ireland. The remaining 8 were divided into 2 groups, so that 4 would be lent for 6 years at a time to Dublin. These 8 include works by Manet, Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Morisot, Vuillard and Degas. In 2008, The National Gallery in London arranged for the entire collection to be on display in Dublin together for the first time. There was a switch in May 2013 for a six-year period.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2015451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015451", "title": "Church tabernacle", "text": "Church tabernacle\n\nA tabernacle is a fixed, locked box in which, in some Christian churches, the Eucharist is \"reserved\" (stored). A less obvious container for the same purpose, set into a wall, is called an aumbry.\n\nWithin Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and in some congregations of Anglicanism and Lutheranism, a tabernacle is a box-like vessel for the exclusive reservation of the consecrated Eucharist. It is normally made of metal, stone or wood, is lockable and secured to its altar or adjacent wall to prevent the consecrated elements within from being removed without authorization. The \"reserved Eucharist\" is secured there for distribution at services, for availability to bring Holy Communion to the sick, and, especially in the Western Church, as the centre of attention for meditation and prayer. The term \"tabernacle\" arose for this item as a reference to the Old Testament tabernacle which was the locus of God's presence among the Jewish people – hence, it was formerly required (and is still generally customary) that the tabernacle be covered with a tent-like veil (conopaeum) or curtains across its door when the Eucharist is present within.\n\nBy way of metaphor, Catholics and Orthodox alike also refer to the Blessed Virgin Mary as the Tabernacle in their devotions (such as the Akathist Hymn or Catholic Litanies to Mary), as she carried within her the body of Christ in her role as Theotokos.\n\nThe following historical information is found, for instance, in the article \"The casing of the Eucharist\" by the Secretary of the Congregation for the Clergy, Archbishop Mauro Piacenza, who also heads the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Patrimony of the Catholic Church, in \"30Days\", No. 6 Year XXIII – June 2005.\n\nIn early Christianity, priests and or lay people commissioned by them took bread consecrated at their Eucharist to their homes, in order to give it to the sick and others unable to attend the celebration. But when the Edict of Milan ended persecution, and the early Church was allowed to practice its religion publicly, the Eucharist was no longer kept safeguarded in private Christian homes, but was reserved near the altars of churches\n\nThe preferred containers, the original \"tabernacles\", then had the form of a (usually gold) dove within a (usually silver) tower. There is mention of a gift of these two vessels, both of gold and adorned with 250 white pearls, that the Emperor Constantine gave to Saint Peter’s Basilica in Rome, and of silver towers and golden doves given to particular churches by Pope Innocent I and Pope Hilarius.\n\nThe vessels were kept in a place called the \"sacrarium\" or \"pastophorium\" away from the central body of the church or were suspended by fine chains from the middle of the canopy (hence called a \"ciborium\" or bread store) above the altar of the church. Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s 29-metre-high Baroque baldacchino over the main altar in today’s Saint Peter’s Basilica is at present the best-known such structure. Later, simpler vessels replaced to some extent the dove and the tower.\n\nBy the thirteenth century, the Eucharist was most often kept in a highly embellished cabinet inserted into the wall to the right or left of the altar. The Altar lamp indicated the Presence of Christ. This was a means of following the decree of the 1215 Fourth Lateran Council requiring that the reserved sacrament be kept in a locked receptacle.\nIn the late fourteenth century, special stone constructions for the Eucharistic bread began to be built, especially in northern Europe. In German and Netherlandish churches of the period, such structures can still be seen: tall towers, known in German as \"Sakramentshäuser\", in Dutch as \"sacramentstorens\", usually placed to the north of the altar and often reaching almost to the ceiling. They were in use until the mid-nineteenth century. As the presence of the sanctuary lamp in the adjacent picture shows, some have been returned to their traditional use.\n\nGerman examples are found in the church of St Lawrence in Nuremberg (18.70 metres), the minster of Salem (16 metres), Saints Peter and Paul city church in Weil der Stadt (over 11 metres), the church of Our Lady in Lübeck (9.5 metres), and St Mary's Cathedral in Fürstenwalde upon Spree. Belgian churches with such sacrament towers include St Catherine's in Zuurbemde, St Martin's in Kortrijk, St Peter's and St James's in Leuven, St James's in Bruges and St Leonard's in Zoutleeuw.\n\nIn the early sixteenth century, Bishop Matteo Giberti ordered that, in his diocese of Verona, in Italy, the container case for the consecrated bread should be placed on an altar. The custom spread through northern Italy. Saint Charles Borromeo, who became Archbishop of Milan, Italy in 1560, had the Sacrament moved from the sacristy to an altar (not the main altar) of his cathedral. The edition of the Roman Missal revised and promulgated by Pope Pius V in 1570 (see Tridentine Mass) still did not envisage placing the tabernacle on an altar: it laid down instead that the altar card containing some of the principal prayers of the Mass should rest against a cross placed midway on the altar (\"Rubricae generales Missalis, XX - De Praeparatione Altaris, et Ornamentorum eius\"). However, in 1614 Pope Paul V imposed on the churches of his diocese of Rome the rule of putting the tabernacle on some altar. Reaction to Protestantism's denial of the reality and permanence of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist then led to the spread of the placing of the tabernacle even on the high altar, so as to make it more evidently visible. Whether on the main altar of the church or in a special chapel, the tabernacle became more and more large and ornate, to the extent of dominating the altar.\n\nThe Catholic Church holds the doctrine of transubstantiation, i.e. that Christ is \"truly present, Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity,\" though under the appearance of bread or wine. This presence perdures after the consecration, so that even after Mass is concluded, the Eucharistic elements are still Christ's Body and Blood. A tabernacle serves as a secure place in which to store the Blessed Sacrament for carrying to the sick who cannot participate in Mass, or as a focus for the prayers of those who visit the church.\n\nThe renewal of the Roman-rite liturgy following the Second Vatican Council (see Mass of Paul VI) was to highlight the primacy of the Eucharistic celebration itself, more than just a means for providing the permanent Eucharistic presence. The altar, it was decided, should be \"truly the centre to which the attention of the whole congregation of the faithful naturally turns\". Before Vatican II, Mass was often celebrated directly in front of the tabernacle. Today, most often, the altar for the celebration of Mass stands on its own, and the tabernacle is given its own, usually smaller, altar or it stands nearby on a pedestal or in its own separate chapel. This allows the faithful to focus on the celebration of the Eucharistic action during Mass, but preserves a dignity of place and fosters\nprayer and meditation outside of Mass by giving the tabernacle its own space.\n\nThe same Instruction lays down that:\n\nTabernacles have generally been made of metal (such as bronze or brass), or sometimes of heavy wood. They are traditionally lined in white cloth (often silk), and are always securely lockable and generally permanently affixed or bolted to their support. Some Tabernacles are veiled when the Eucharist is present in them. These veils are often of cloth and design similar to the priest's vestments (that is, to create a harmony of design), and are either white (the color of the Eucharist), gold (which may be substituted for white), or of violet, green or red depending on the liturgical color of the day or season.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, the (reserved sacrament) are kept in a tabernacle (Greek: αρτοφοριον \"artophorion\") or \"ark\" (Slavonic: ковчег \"kovchég\") on the altar at all times. The tabernacle is normally wrought of gold, silver, or wood and elaborately decorated. It is often shaped like a miniature church building, and usually has a cross on the top of it. It may be opened using small doors, or a drawer that pulls out. Some churches keep the tabernacle under a glass dome to protect it (and the Holy Mysteries) from dust and changes in humidity.\n\nThe Orthodox do not have a concept of Eucharistic adoration as a devotion separated from the reception of Holy Communion. But the Holy Mysteries are treated with utmost respect, as they believe in the Real presence of the Body and Blood of Christ. The clergy must be vested whenever they handle the Holy Mysteries. During the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts (wherein Communion is received from the reserved Sacrament), when the consecrated Holy Mysteries are brought out during the Great Entrance, everyone makes a full prostration—even the chanters stop singing and prostrate themselves while the entrance is made in silence.\n\nWhen Orthodox Christians receive Holy Communion, they always receive in both species: the Body and the Blood of Christ. This includes Communion taken to the sick. Therefore, both are reserved in the tabernacle. Every year on Holy Thursday, the reserved Mysteries are renewed. The priest will cut an extra Lamb (host) for that liturgy and after the consecration, just before the clergy receive communion, the priest will take the extra Lamb and carefully pour a little of the Blood of Christ over it. This Lamb will then be cut into very small portions, allowed to dry thoroughly, and be placed in the tabernacle. The deacon (or priest, if there is no deacon) will consume whatever remains of the previous year's reserved sacrament when he performs the ablutions.\n\nTypically, a sanctuary lamp is kept burning in the Holy Place (sanctuary) when the Mysteries are reserved. This may be a separate lamp hanging from the ceiling, or it may be the top lamp of the seven-branch candlestick which sits either on top of the Holy Table or behind it.\n\nA small receptacle called a pyx is used for taking communion to the sick. While designs may differ, this often consists of a metal case with a chain attached so it can be hung around the neck. Inside the case are several compartments. One compartment contains a small box with a tightly-fitting lid into which some of the reserved Holy Mysteries will be placed. There is also a place for a very small chalice, just enough to hold a small amount of wine and a particle of the reserved Mysteries. There will be a small bottle to hold ordinary wine (not consecrated) which is used to soften the particle before it is consumed, a small pair of tweezers with which the priest removes a particle of the Mysteries from the box to place it in the chalice without touching it, and finally a small communion spoon with which to administer Holy Communion. This sick call kit is normally kept on the Holy Table, or sometimes on the Table of Oblation.\n\nRather than using a kit like the one described above, a priest may use a small chalice with a tight-fitting lid. He pours a little wine into the chalice, places a particle of the reserved Mysteries in the wine, and attaches the lid. He will take the chalice and a communion spoon to administer Holy Communion to the sick.\n\nA smaller tabernacle, sometimes referred to as a pyx, is used during Great Lent. This tends to be a rectangular, gold-plated box, often with a cross on top, with a hinged lid. On Sundays during Great Lent, the priest will consecrate extra Lambs (in the same manner as on Holy Thursday), for use during the Presanctified Liturgy. These Lambs will be kept in the pyx on the Holy Table, or sometimes on the Prothesis (Table of Oblation).\n\nReservation of the blessed sacrament is permitted in the Lutheran Churches, although not for the purposes of Eucharistic adoration. In Lutheran parishes that practice sacramental reservation, a chancel lamp is kept near the tabernacle or aumbry.\n\nThe Evangelical Catholic Church, a Lutheran denomination of Evangelical Catholic churchmanship based in North America, taught:\nOnly some Anglican parishes of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship use tabernacles, either fixed on the altar, placed behind or above it, or off to one side. As in Catholic churches, the presence of the reserved sacrament is indicated by a \"presence lamp\" – an oil or wax-based flame in a clear glass vessel placed close to the tabernacle. Normally, only ciboria and Blessed Sacrament are placed in the tabernacle, although it is not uncommon for the wine or consecrated oils to be placed there as well. When the tabernacle is vacant, it is common practice to leave it open so that the faithful will not inadvertently perform an act of devotion (such as bowing or genuflecting). Tabernacles are customarily lined with, if not constructed from, cedar wood, whose aromatic qualities discourage insect life.\n\nE. J. Bicknell in \"A Theological Introduction to the Thirty-Nine Articles\" writes that \"According to the first Prayer-Book of Edward VI the sick might be communicated with the reserved sacrament on the same day as a celebration in church.\" \"Article XXVIII — Of the Lord's Supper\" in Anglicanism's 39 Articles and \"Article XVIII — Of the Lord's Supper\" in Methodism's Articles of Religion state that \"The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshiped.\" The Rev. Jonathan A. Mitchican, founder of \"The Conciliar Anglican\" writes that this \"Article\" \"does not explicitly ban these practices but does add a note of caution about them by pointing to the fact that none of them are biblical.\" As such, the reserved sacrament was used by Anglican priests who held these views to administer communion to persons unable to attend church through illness. However, in 1885 the upper house of Convocation ruled against this practice, declaring \"the practice of reservation is contrary to the wise and carefully revised Order of the Church of England\".\n\nAmong those Anglicans who identify as \"Anglo-Catholics,\" the Protestant Reformation is often considered one episode in church history which no longer defines their faith as Anglicans. After the Oxford Movement, reservation became commonplace in large parts of the Anglican Communion, and some parishes also perform services of solemn benediction and/or other forms of Eucharistic adoration.\n\nThe Anglo-Catholic manual of rites and ceremonies \"Ritual Notes\" described tabernacles as generally made of wood (they could however be of gold, silver or even iron; if of iron this should be enclosed in gilt-wood, wrought metal or carved stone). If the material be metal there should be an inner lining of poplar or cedar wood and in any case a lining also of white silk or cloth of gold or silver. The tabernacle should be securely fixed to the altar or (shelf), but away from the wall so that the conopaeum (a veil used to cover it when it contains the blessed sacrament) can completely surround it. The veil may be white or varying in liturgical colour. There may be a second tabernacle but not more in the same church but if so only one should be used at any time. A lamp should remain lit nearby when the tabernacle is in use.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2015461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015461", "title": "Stadium seating", "text": "Stadium seating\n\nStadium seating or theater seating is a characteristic seating arrangement that is most commonly associated with performing-arts venues, and derives its name from stadiums, which typically use this arrangement.\n\nIn stadium seating, most or all seats are placed higher than the seats immediately in front of them so that the occupants of further-back seats have less of their views blocked by those further forward. This is especially necessary in stadiums where the subject matter is typically best observed from above, rather than in-line or from below. In addition to sports venues and performing arts venues, many other venues that require clear audience views of a single area use stadium seating, including religious institutions, lecture halls, and movie theaters.\n\nAn alternative to stadium seating is to place the focal area at a higher level than the audience, so that the audience may look above those people in front of them to see, (like the green circle in the illustration, right), avoiding blocked sight-lines . One example of this is floor seating of a music venue which has a raised stage; seats are commonly all at an equal height on the actual floor of a venue, such as the floor seats at a concert held in a sports arena.\n\nBecause the increased angle of stadium seating, seats are typically (but not universally) installed on a stepped floor surface which also functions as a staircase in the aisles. This is as opposed to the common usage of a flat, often slightly sloped, floor used in many standard seating venues (such as many stage theaters). There has been some criticism of stadium seating because, due to the stepped layout, it is usually not possible for disabled people in wheelchairs to move about. Venues with stadium seating generally place handicapped seating among the row which is at the level of the concourse which feeds the seating area, leaving more space than rows above or below it, and leaving chair-less space(s) for wheelchairs.\n\nThe trains on some roller coasters are also configured in tiers; this seating configuration is also sometimes called stadium seating. Three prominent examples of roller coasters whose trains use this type of seating are Millennium Force at Cedar Point, which opened in 2000, SheiKra at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, which opened in 2005, and Griffon at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, which opened in 2007.\n\nConverting sloped-floor theaters to stadium seating often requires raising the ceiling and adding risers, so owners of movie theaters often judge conversion as not cost effective.\n\n"}

He had a UK Top 10 hit single in 1982 with \"Orville's Song\" which reached number 4 in the charts.\n\nThe son of variety performers, Harris assisted in his father's ventriloquy acts as a child; as a teenager, he created his own ventriloquism characters which he performed at holiday resorts in the summer season, attracting the attention of television producers. He debuted on screen in 1965 and became a popular act guest starring on various shows; he had his first solo series \"Cuddles and Company\" in the 1970s, but got his big break in 1982 with \"The Keith Harris Show\". He, Orville and Cuddles became popular performers on primetime television until the show was cancelled in 1990, as audiences and television producers began to move away from variety performances. \n\nAfter a low period and two failed business ventures in the early 1990s, he embarked on a busy stage career (mostly in pantomime) and found new appreciation in the 2000s, appearing as a guest in several television programmes. His output declined after a 2013 cancer diagnosis and he died two years later.\n\nBorn in Lyndhurst, Hampshire on 21 September 1947, Harris grew up in North Baddesley in Hampshire and near Chester (where he attended a secondary modern school). His parents were variety performers; his mother Lilian \"Lila\", \"née\" Simmons (born 1917), was a dancer; his father, Norman Harris (born 1912), was a singer, comedian and ventriloquist. From age nine Harris appeared on his father Norman's knee as a \"dummy\" in his ventriloquist act. Harris was severely dyslexic at school and in 2014, he claimed that his dyslexia had cost him millions of pounds because of his inability to read contracts accurately. \n\nHarris began creating ventriloquism characters as a teenager. After appearing in summer seasons at holiday resorts, he had spots on the television series \"Let's Laugh\" (1965). Harris became a popular act on television variety shows, and following a spell as the host of \"The Black and White Minstrel Show\", was given his own show called \"Cuddles and Company\". He appeared several times on BBC TV's long-running show \"The Good Old Days\".\n\nHarris' best known creation, Orville the duck, came about after he saw some green fur lying around backstage at a performance of \"The Black and White Minstrel Show\" in Bristol. Orville, recalled Simon Farquhar in his \"Independent\" obituary of Harris, was \"a huge, gormless, falsetto-voiced green duckling sporting a nappy fastened by a giant safety pin\". Harris recorded \"Orville's song\", written by Bobby Crush. It made the Top Ten in the UK singles chart in 1982 and sold 400,000 copies. It was later voted the worst song ever recorded.\n\n\"The Keith Harris Show\" ran on Saturday evenings on BBC1 from 1982 to 1990 and a series for children \"The Quack Chat Show\" (1989–90) also on BBC1. Harris appeared in several Royal Variety Performances and also performed privately for the Royal Family. At the request of Diana, Princess of Wales he was booked as an act for the birthdays of Princes William and Harry at each of their respective third birthdays at Highgrove and Kensington Palace.\n\nThe end of Harris's television show coincided with a period when television was \"turning away from variety acts\". He entered a period of depression, drank heavily and was arrested for drunk driving; his third marriage collapsed during this period. He also opened clubs in Blackpool and Portugal which failed, leading him to declare bankruptcy twice. However, he recovered and began performing in clubs, in pantomimes and at holiday camps, touring the United Kingdom; he wrote 17 of his own pantomimes and had his own pantomime company, Keith Harris Productions, which he sold in 2009 to Richard Jordan.\n\nAlongside his continued pantomime performances, from the late 1990s Harris and Orville also enjoyed what \"The Stage\" described as a \"long Indian summer\" as they re-emerged on television in a new \"era of knowing post-modern irony\". Harris made guest appearances in a number of television shows during the 2000s including \"Harry Hill\", \"Never Mind the Buzzcocks\", \"Little Britain\", \"Al Murray's Happy Hour\", \"Banzai\" and \"The Weakest Link\" (2004). In 2002, he was the subject of a Louis Theroux documentary \"When Louis Met... Keith Harris\". He and Orville won the Channel 5 reality TV show \"The Farm\" in 2005, the same year that he featured in Peter Kay and Tony Christie's music video to \"(Is This the Way to) Amarillo\". He became an auctioneer on Bid TV and also appeared in an episode of the first season of the children's television programme \"The Slammer\" (2006). According to \"The Guardian\", this renewed attention \"established a new cult status for Harris and Orville and triggered a small comeback\"; he appeared in \"Ashes to Ashes\" (2009) and \"Shameless\" (2011), in student unions (with his more adult show, \"Duck Off\"), and performed to the housemates in \"Celebrity Big Brother\" (2012).\n\nHarris had his spleen removed and chemotherapy after a cancer diagnosis in 2013. He subsequently returned to work. The cancer returned in 2014 and he died on 28 April 2015, at the age of 67 at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. \n\nIn Harris's obituary in \"The Stage\", Michael Quinn noted that \"For more than a decade, ventriloquist Keith Harris was one of the biggest stars in light entertainment... Together, the saccharine-sweet avian [Orville], acerbic simian [Cuddles] and Harris as straight man and stooge were one of the most high-profile acts of the 1980s\". Quinn also pointed out that this popularity faded after that decade, but that Harris nevertheless remained appreciated by audiences until his retirement. \"The Telegraph\", however, remarked that the 2002 Louis Theroux documentary exposed a \"darker side\" of Harris, \"a nervous, edgy man who kept telling rotten jokes\" and who struggled to forgive past slights against him. In the same documentary, Harris said of Orville that he had \"created a monster\" who would achieve more name recognition than Harris himself.\n\nHarris lived with his fourth wife (married in 1999), Sarah Metcalf (b. March 1966), and his two youngest children, Shenton (born in 2001) and Kitty (now a singer, born in 2000), in Poulton-le-Fylde near Blackpool, where he converted the local cinema and bingo hall into a jazz nightclub called \"Club L’Orange\". \n\nHe had his first daughter, Skye, in 1986with his second wife of nine years, singer Jacqui Scott, a winner of a BBC talent show in 1979 who entered the 1980 \"\" contest with her own composition.\n\n\n"}

It is an administrative center of Razgrad Province.\n\nThe suffix \"grad\" means city in Bulgarian, while the origin and the meaning of the first part \"raz\" is obscure. \nDuring the Second Bulgarian Empire, around the present city there was a settlement, mentioned by the names of \"Hrasgrad\", \"Hrazgrad\" and \"Hrizgrad\"'. These names come from the name of the Proto-Bulgarian and Slavic god Hors.\n\nRazgrad was built upon the ruins of the Ancient Roman town of Abritus on the banks of the Beli Lom river. Abritus was built on a Thracian settlement of the 4th-5th century BC with unknown name. Several bronze coins of the Thracian king Seuthes III (330-300 BC) and pottery were found, as well as artifacts from other rulers and a sacrificial altar of Hercules.\n\nSome of Razgrad's landmarks include the Varosha architectural complex from the 19th century, the ethnographic museum and several other museums, the characteristic clock tower in the centre built in 1864, the St Nicholas the Miracle Worker Church from 1860, the \"Momina cheshma\" sculpture, the Mausoleum Ossuary of the Liberators (1879–1880) and the Ibrahim Pasha Mosque from 1530. The mosque is said to be one of the largest in the Balkans.\n\nIn 251, the town was the site of the Battle of Abrittus, during which the Goths defeated a Roman army under the emperors Trajan Decius and Herennius Etruscus. The battle is notable for being the first occasion of a Roman emperor being killed in a battle with barbarians.\n\nRazgrad Peak on Greenwich Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Razgrad.\n\nIn January 2012, Razgrad was inhabited by 33,416 people within the city limits, while the Razgrad Municipality with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 50,457 inhabitants. The number of the residents of the city (not the municipality) reached its peak in the period 1988-1991 when exceeded 55,000.

After reaching the UEFA Europa League round of 16 during the 2013–14 season, the club also made their UEFA Champions League debut appearance a season later.

{"id": "2015487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015487", "title": "Jack McFarland", "text": "Jack McFarland\n\nJohn Philip \"Jack\" McFarland is a fictional character on the American television sitcom \"Will & Grace\", played by Sean Hayes.\n\nJack is Will Truman's (Eric McCormack) best friend. A \"camp\" gay man, Jack has always had a passion for acting and the theatre, although virtually everyone he knows tells him he has no talent. Very mercurial, he changes careers rapidly from cater waiter, Banana Republic and Barneys New York sales clerk, to acting teacher, to student nurse, to surfer, to back-up dancer for Jennifer Lopez and Janet Jackson. Although he considers all his relationships serious, only one lasted longer than a few weeks (with Stuart, a client of Will's played by Dave Foley), and even that one ended with Jack's cheating.\n\nJack is unashamedly vain and self-absorbed, and adores all gay icons, particularly Cher, of whom he has a rare doll. (He met her once, although he mistook her for a drag queen. He would also meet Cher in a dream where she appeared as God, complete with an entourage of \"dancing fairies\"). According to Will, he has the best gaydar in the tristate area. He is a fan of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", particularly lesbian character Willow Rosenberg. He also collects clippings of celebrities' hair, including a complete collection from the four main actresses on \"The Golden Girls\", as well as Broadway icons Bernadette Peters, Betty Buckley, Idina Menzel, and – as of season seven — Patti LuPone. Jack also stalks actor Kevin Bacon, briefly becoming the actor's assistant.\n\nHe believes in gay rights, but tends to lend his support to shallow causes, such as protesting NBC censoring a gay kiss on a television show (\"What about our Constitutional right to see two hotties get it on?\"). Nevertheless, his intentions are essentially good: For example, in one episode he uses all his nest-egg money to save a pair of gay penguins at the zoo in order to make Will happy.\n\nJack was born February 16, 1969, and was raised by his mother Judith (Veronica Cartwright) and stepfather Daniel (Beau Bridges). He also had a babysitter named Sissy (played in one episode by Demi Moore). His mother did not know he was gay, and his stepfather was not close to him. He claims to have come out as early as preschool. While he was in high school, Jack befriended Will and helped him come to terms with his sexuality. They have been best friends ever since.\n\nSince the first season, Jack has established a close bond with alcoholic socialite Karen Walker (Megan Mullally), who works as Grace's secretary. Karen is his closest female friend, and they bond due to their shared narcissism and materialism. Jack also strikes up a friendship with Will's other best friend Grace Adler (Debra Messing), through association with Will and Karen.\n\nIn the pilot episode, Jack is living with Will while his floors are re-done, but has to find elsewhere to live when Grace moves in. At the end of season one, Jack agrees to marry Karen's maid Rosario (Shelley Morrison) to secure her green card. Jack lives with Karen for the entirety of season two, but after a year together, the marriage is annulled when Rosario wants to marry Karen's gardener. Therefore, at the end of season two, Jack moves in with Will, but when Will takes Grace in after an attempted burglary at her apartment, Jack agrees to sublet Grace's apartment — although Will, Karen, and his mother pay the rent. (In \"Moveable Feast Part 1,\" it emerged that each of the three pays one half of the cost, meaning that Jack is actually collecting one and a half times the actual amount of his rent.)\n\nIn season three, Jack undertakes a search for his biological father, which ends when he discovers that his father died several years back. Jack does, however, meet Elliot (Michael Angarano), his own biological son, whom he fathered by depositing at a sperm bank as a teenager so that he could buy a leather jacket. He later discovers that the boy's mother Bonnie (Rosie O'Donnell) is a lesbian; she was a nurse at the sperm bank who stole Jack's deposit and was inseminated with it.\n\nJack's most consistent vocation results from his taking over the class of his acting teacher Zandra (Eileen Brennan) after she is fed up with his lack of talent. After taking everyone's money and leaving, another student (Stacy Keach) takes over the class and begins teaching the \"McFarland method\" (\"acting is attracting\") without Jack's knowledge. He also trains to be a student nurse, but ultimately gives it up when, during Karen's fourth wedding, he meets Jennifer Lopez and becomes her back-up dancer (and, for a short time, Janet Jackson's back-up dancer), a career that fizzles as well.\n\nIn the seventh season, Jack embarks on a proper career as a producer for OutTV, a new gay television network. By season's end, his profile rises to the point that he is given a talk show of his own to host. In season eight, however, Jack loses his job at the network after he speaks out against the new right-wing ownership of the show, which has given him a conservative co-host named Amber Louise (Britney Spears). He has a hard time finding work, and out of desperation auditions for a minor role on a television show. Feeling depressed and rejected at the time, he displays real emotion instead of his usual over-dramatic acting style, and ends up getting the lead role of Chuck Rafferty, a straight, alcoholic, womanizing cop.\n\nIn the series finale, Jack is forced into a relationship with Karen's nemesis Beverley Leslie (Leslie Jordan); Karen, who has recently lost all of her money, demands that he take up with the obnoxious millionaire so he can inherit Leslie's fortune and keep her in the lifestyle to which she is accustomed. Eventually Karen realizes that she is doing to Jack what her mother did to her, and tells him that she cares more about his happiness than the money. When Beverley dies after being swept off his balcony by a gust of wind, Jack is left with his money, which he shares with Karen. A flash forward reveals that, 16 years later, Jack and Karen are still living together.\n\nWhen the series was revived in 2017, however, the events of the finale were retconned. In the new continuity, Jack was never engaged to Beverly Leslie, is not rich, is still living across the hall from Will and Grace, and is still pursuing an acting career while throwing himself at every available man in sight. During the ninth season, he takes up a part-time job as rehearsal pianist and acting teacher at the Bronx Boys and Girls Club. In the 11th season, he takes over as owner and manager of Cleo's, a legendary New York gay bar.\n\nIn the series finale, Jack is cast in a Broadway show as a \"fifth understudy\", and finally achieves his dream of appearing on the Great White Way when the original actor and all four other understudies call in sick. In the final scene, he goes with Will, Grace, and Karen to the hospital when Grace goes into labor.\n\nJack is known for his several various flings throughout the show. Most of them are mentioned but not shown, and Jack never seems to take any of them seriously or settle down with anyone for very long. Jack's longest relationship is with Stuart Lamarack (Dave Foley), which lasts several months during the sixth season, until Jack cheats on him. During the ninth season, Jack enters into a relationship with Drew (Ryan Pinkston) after realising he fears growing old and lonely. Drew later abruptly breaks up with Jack after two months, claiming he is not ready for a committed relationship and wants to see other people, which devastates Jack as he realises he is now ready to settle down with someone. In the ninth season finale, he instantly goes on a rebound fling and quickly gets engaged to Estefan (Brian Jordan Alvarez), a man he met on said rebound vacation. While Jack at first struggles with the idea of a lifelong commitment, he finally realizes that he loves Estefan, and marries him in the 10th season finale.\n\nThe episode \"Lows in the Mid-Eighties\" reveals that Jack met Will at a party in 1985 and realized immediately that he was gay. After Will comes out of the closet, he and Jack become best friends, with Jack helping Will navigate life as an openly gay man.\n\nWhile they care deeply for each other, however, Jack and Will fight and make fun of each other constantly. Jack often calls Will \"bald and fat\" (which he clearly isn't), while Will makes fun of Jack's promiscuity, shallowness, and perpetual unemployment. Nevertheless, Will pays virtually all of Jack's bills, including half his rent (with Karen and Jack's mother also paying half each).\n\nSeveral episodes suggest that Jack has feelings for Will. In \"Lows in the Mid-Eighties,\" he confesses his love to Will, but tries to pass it off as a 'test of friendship' when Will doesn't feel the same. He has a similar reaction in an eighth-season episode when Will's boyfriend James (Taye Diggs) accuses him of being jealous of their relationship.\n\nJack and Karen meet in the second episode of the first season, and become instant best friends. Karen calls Jack \"poodle\" and lavishes him with gifts and attention, while also paying half his rent. They also provide each other with emotional support (in their own self-absorbed fashion), with Karen defending him from people who treat him unkindly and Jack giving her a shoulder to cry on when her marriage falls apart.\n\nIn the series finale, Jack reluctantly moves in Karen's nemesis Beverley Leslie to provide for a newly bankrupt Karen. However, Karen realizes that she doesn't want him to make a mistake and stops him from marrying Beverley. After Beverley dies, Jack inherits his money, and he and Karen live together in luxury for the rest of their lives. The 2017 revival retcons these events as one of Karen's drug-induced hallucinations, though Karen does not tell Jack about what happened to him in this dream.\n\nJack and Grace initially dislike each other, seeing each other as competition for Will's attention. Eventually, they bond over their shared love of ice skating. For the remainder of the series, they are good friends, although they make fun of each other constantly.\n\nIn the third season, Jack finds out that he has a son, Elliot (Michael Angarano), conceived through in vitro fertilization using sperm that Jack donated to a sperm bank years before. Jack initially has trouble adjusting to fatherhood, especially since Elliot's mother Bonnie (Rosie O'Donnell) dislikes him. Eventually, however, Jack realizes that he loves Elliot and commits (in his own way) to being a good father.\n\nIn the revived series, Jack and Elliot have been estranged for several years. Jack learns that Elliot has a son, Skip, who is presumed to be gay. He is horrified to learn that Elliot and his wife are sending Skip to \"hetero camp\", and follows the boy there to tell him that there is nothing wrong with him. Elliot realizes the error of his ways and invites Jack into his family.\n\nThe character has gained a mixed reception from critics for perpetuating gay stereotypes. Nevertheless, Hayes won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 2000 for his performance.\n\n"}

He is one of only five people ever designated an \"Exemplar of Racing\" by the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. He was co-heir to one of America's greatest business fortunes, derived from the Mellon Bank created by his grandfather Thomas Mellon, his father Andrew W. Mellon, and his father's brother Richard B. Mellon. In 1957, when \"Fortune\" prepared its first list of the wealthiest Americans, it estimated that Paul Mellon, his sister Ailsa Mellon-Bruce, and his cousins Sarah Mellon and Richard King Mellon, were all among the richest eight people in the United States, with fortunes of between 400 and 700 million dollars each (around $ and $ in today's dollars).\n\nMellon's autobiography, \"Reflections in a Silver Spoon\", was published in 1992. He died at his home, Oak Spring, in Upperville, Virginia, on February 1, 1999. He was survived by his wife, Rachel (a.k.a. Bunny), his children, Catherine Conover (first wife of John Warner) and Timothy Mellon, and two stepchildren, Stacy Lloyd III and Eliza, Viscountess Moore.\n\nPaul Mellon was the son of Andrew W. Mellon, US Secretary of the Treasury from 1921 to 1932, and Nora McMullen of Hertfordshire and brother of Ailsa Mellon-Bruce. He graduated from The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, in 1925, where he wrote for the literary magazine. He then went on to graduate from Yale College and the University of Cambridge. At Yale, he was a member of Chi Psi fraternity, Scroll and Key and served as vice-chairman of the \"Yale Daily News\". He was a great benefactor of his alma maters, donating to the Forbes-Mellon Library at the University of Cambridge, the Mellon Arts Center and the Mellon (now Icahn) Science Center to Choate, two residential colleges, and the Yale Center for British Art.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale, he went to England to study at the University of Cambridge, receiving a BA in 1931, while his father served as the US Ambassador to the Court of St. James's from 1932 to 1933. In 1930, he was a founding member, alongside Sir Timothy William Gowers, of the CRABS, the Clare Rugby And Boating Society (the oldest of the collegiate Gentlemen's societies still active). In 1938, he received an Oxbridge MA from Clare College, Cambridge. He was a major benefactor to Clare College's Forbes-Mellon Library, opened in 1986.\n\nMellon returned to Pittsburgh, to work for Mellon Bank and other businesses for six months. In 1935, he married Mary Conover Brown and the couple, who had two children, Catherine and Timothy, moved to Virginia.\n\nHe enrolled at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland in 1940 but six months later joined the United States Army, asking to join the cavalry. Mellon served with the Morale Operations Branch of the Office of Strategic Services in Europe. He rose to the rank of major and was the recipient of four battle stars in the European Theatre of Operations.\n\nAfter his wife Mary's death in 1946 from an asthma attack, he married Rachel Lambert Lloyd, known as \"Bunny\", the former wife of Stacy Barcroft Lloyd Jr. She was a descendant of the Lambert family who formulated and marketed Listerine and an heiress to the Warner-Lambert corporate fortune (Warner-Lambert is now part of Pfizer, following a 2000 merger). Bunny Mellon was an avid horticulturist and gardener, whose fondness for French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painting, as well as American art, Mellon came to share. By this marriage, he had two stepchildren: Stacy Lloyd III and Eliza Lambert Lloyd (d. 2008; who married and divorced Viscount Moore).\n\nWhile Mellon did not share his father's interest in business, the two found common ground in their love of art and philanthropy. Shortly before Andrew Mellon's death in 1937, construction began on the West Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., for which Andrew Mellon had provided funds. Four years later Paul Mellon presented both the building by John Russell Pope and his father's collection of 115 paintings to the nation. He served on the museum's board for more than four decades: as trustee, as president (twice), as board chair, and as honorary trustee. Mellon commissioned I. M. Pei to build the East Building and, with his sister Ailsa, provided funds for its construction in the late 1970s. Over the years he and his wife Bunny donated more than 1,000 works to the National Gallery of Art, among them many French and American masterworks.\n\nIn 1936, Mellon purchased his first British painting, \"Pumpkin with a Stable-lad\" by George Stubbs, who became a lifetime favorite of Mellon's. Beginning in the late 1950s, with the help of English art historian Basil Taylor, Mellon amassed a major collection by the mid-1960s. London art dealer Geoffrey Agnew once said of his acquisitions: \"It took an American collector to make the English look again at their own paintings.\" Mellon's collection was catalogued by Dudley Snelgrove and Judy Egerton.\n\nMellon granted his extensive collection of British art, rare books, and related materials to Yale University in the 1960s, along with the funding to create an appropriate museum to house it (designed by Louis Kahn). He characteristically insisted that it not be named in honor of him, but rather would be called the Yale Center for British Art, to encourage others to support it as well. Mellon also provided extensive endowment support to fund not only operations but also an ongoing program of acquisitions, and he made a generous bequest to the Center at the time of his death. The Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art was founded in 1970 through a generous grant to Yale University, as a London-based affiliate of the New Haven center, to encourage study of British art and culture both at the undergraduate and the research scholar levels.\n\nMellon also provided important leadership gifts to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia, as well as Choate Rosemary Hall.\n\nMellon owned many thoroughbred horses under his Rokeby Stables, including Kentucky Derby winner Sea Hero. Two of his horses, Arts and Letters and Fort Marcy, were named American Horse of the Year in 1969 and 1970 respectively. Both are inductees in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. He also owned three European champions, Mill Reef { Forrest Flower } and Gold and Ivory. Mill Reef was the #8 rated horse in the world for the 20th Century in \"A Century of Champions\", by John Randall and Tony Morris. Mellon won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Breeder in 1971 and again in 1986.\n\nMellon established the Old Dominion Foundation in 1941 and the Bollingen Foundation in 1945, both to support advancement and learning of the humanities and liberal education. The Bollingen Foundation published over 100 books before closing in 1969, the same year the assets of the Old Dominion Foundation were merged into those of his sister Ailsa's Avalon Foundation. The combined organization was renamed The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in honor of their father.\n\nPaul Mellon's foremost philanthropic interest was his alma mater, Yale University. His most generous and well-known gifts established the Yale Center for British Art, but his legacy makes itself felt across the campus.\n\nMellon's other major gift was to provide extensive funding to support the creation of two new undergraduate residential colleges at Yale, Ezra Stiles College and Morse College. Designed by Eero Saarinen, these colleges along with the Kahn-designed British Art Center demonstrated Mellon's commitment to bringing modern architecture to Yale. Perhaps most importantly, the additional undergraduate capacity that these colleges provided were a critical prerequisite to the ability of the university to transition to co-education.\n\nBeyond these capital gifts, Mellon endowed the deanships of each of Yale's 12 residential colleges. He created the Mellon Senior Forum program, which provides a weekly meal for seniors in each of the residential colleges where they can share progress on their senior essays and projects with one another.\n\nMellon was active in the humanities at Yale. He provided the funding necessary to create the Directed Studies program of intense freshman-year focus on the humanities. He supported significantly the undergraduate theater studies program, and endowed named professorships in schools throughout the University, particularly in the humanities.\n\nMellon was highly supportive of causes that advanced the preservation of horses, including the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation. That organization allocates grants towards specific research projects for the safety, welfare, longevity and improvement of life for race horses.\n\nHe donated the $1 million bonus that Sea Hero won in the Chrysler Triple Crown Challenge to the United States Jockey Club's Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation. Furthermore, he requested that double that amount be raised in response to his donation. That goal was met during the 1995–1996 fiscal year. Upon his death he left yet another $2.5 million to the Foundation's endowment.\n\nIn 1999, Paul Mellon bequeathed $8 million to the University of Cambridge in England for the Fitzwilliam Museum. During his lifetime he agreed that £1 million of that sum could be allocated to the Museum's Courtyard Development and, under the terms of his Will, following his death in 1999, his Executors subsequently allocated a further $12.5 million to complete the renovations associated with the Courtyard, including the re-lighting of all of the Museum's galleries. The remaining balance was added to the Paul Mellon Fund which was established as a trust fund for the Museum at the time of the bequest, the income from which is being used to support education, exhibitions and publications.\n\nHe also helped to buy the 28,625-acre Cape Hatteras National Seashore and the 1,500-acre Sky Meadows State Park in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, where he used to go to look at the stars.\n\nHe was also a major benefactor of Clare College and Clare Hall, both in Cambridge, England. Indeed, Clare Hall, founded 1966, gains much from his benefaction; his generous bequest serves the intellectual needs of the graduate college members. The Mellon Fellowship is another example of his generosity, permitting the reciprocal exchange of two students from Yale and two from Clare College for graduate study in each other's institutions.\n\nHe developed his great love of England and English culture while studying at Clare College from 1929-1931. \"It was while I was at Cambridge that I embarked on the dangerous seas of collecting\", Paul Mellon once said—a statement by the man who described himself as \"the incurable collector\" that has had profound implications for his major beneficiaries, both in the US and the UK.\n\nMellon helped to arrange the merger of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, founded by his father Andrew W. Mellon and uncle Richard B. Mellon with Andrew Carnegie's Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1967 to create Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Additionally, he donated substantial funds to Carnegie Mellon.\n\nPaul Mellon was a trustee of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame and one of the only five people ever designated an \"Exemplar of Racing\" by the Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and the English Jockey Club Hall of Fame.\n\nAmong honors, he was created an Honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1974, awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1985, and awarded the National Medal of Arts and Humanities in 1997.\n\nIn 1978, Mellon received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.\n\n\n\n"}

She plays in both the Irish Traditional and Baroque styles.\n\nMary Bergin was born in Shankill, County Dublin, Ireland. Her parents Joe and Máire were melodeon and fiddle players, respectively. Mary started learning to play the tin whistle at the age of nine.\n\nBergin won the All Ireland tin whistle championship in 1970. Her two virtuosic recordings of the solo tin whistle, \"Feadóga Stáin\" (1979) and \"Feadóga Stáin 2\" (1993), have been critically cited as \"outstanding and unequalled\".\n\nBergin moved to An Spidéal, County Galway, in the early 1970s and played with many of the up-and-coming stars of the Irish music scene, notably De Danann and Ceoltóri Laighin. She is currently a member of the group Dordán, who perform Irish traditional music and Baroque music with pieces by George Frideric Handel, Henry Purcell and a tune from Johann Sebastian Bach's Little Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach.\n\nIn addition to releasing two solo albums, which aided the popularisation of modern traditional Irish tin whistle playing, and three albums with Dordán, Bergin has taught hundreds of students, in Ireland, across Europe, and in the United States, to play the whistle.\n\nBergin was exposed to the music of many renowned musicians from an early age, but her style is particularly influenced by flute player Packie Duignan and the whistle playing of Willie Clancy. She plays the whistle \"left-handed\", with the right hand covering the upper tone holes, unlike most whistle players who play with the left hand on top.\n\nBergin's playing is characterized by great feeling, technical virtuosity, and a respect for the music. Music scholar Fintan Vallely has described her playing as \"brightly ornamented but uncluttered\", with \"crisp articulation\". Writer and flute player Grey Larsen uses similar terms, describing her playing as \"precise\", \"elegant\", and \"streamlined\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2015514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015514", "title": "Faurot Field", "text": "Faurot Field\n\nFaurot Field , at Memorial Stadium is a stadium in Columbia, Missouri, United States, on the campus of the University of Missouri. It is primarily used for football and serves as the home field for the Missouri Tigers football program. It is the third-largest sports facility by seating capacity in the state of Missouri, behind The Dome at America's Center in St. Louis and Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. In 1972, Memorial Stadium's playing surface was named Faurot Field in honor of longtime coach Don Faurot.\n\nDuring the offseason, soccer goals are set up in the end zones and it is used for intramural matches. Until 2012 it was the site of the annual \"Providence Bowl\" game between Hickman and Rock Bridge high schools, so named because both schools are located on Providence Road in Columbia, and Faurot is roughly equidistant between the two. This tradition stopped when Missouri joined the Southeastern Conference and conference scheduling made hosting the game more difficult. Faurot Field has also served as the host of Missouri State High School Activities Association (MSHSAA) football championships.\n\nThe stadium is an early 20th century horseshoe-shaped stadium, with seating added on in the \"open\" (south) end zone. The original horseshoe is completed by a grass berm in the curved end, which is used for general admission on game days. The berm is famous for the giant block \"M\" made of painted white stones located behind the end zone. A paved path encircled the west, north and east sides of the field taking the place of the track, but was removed in 1994.\n\nFundraising began in 1921 for a \"Memorial Union\" and a \"Memorial Stadium\" to be constructed at the University. The names of the two projects were a tribute to Mizzou alumni who lost their lives during World War I. Ground was broken on the site of the future stadium in December 1925. The site was a sizeable natural valley that lay between twin bluffs south of the campus. Original plans called for the stadium to seat 25,000, with proposed stages of expansion in capacity to 35,000, 55,000, 75,000 and 95,000. According to legend, a rock crusher and truck were buried during initial blasting, which still remain buried under the field.\n\nMemorial Stadium was dedicated on October 2, 1926, to the memory of 112 alumni and students who lost their lives in World War I. The 25,000-seat stadium—the lower half of the current facility—was built with a track that circled the playing field. That first October game against Tulane was marred by rainstorms that washed out a bridge into Columbia coming from the western side of Missouri. While the game sold out, the field could not be sodded due to the wet conditions. Therefore, a surface of sawdust and tree bark was used, and \"the Tigers and Green Wave played to a scoreless, mudpie tie\", in the words of sportswriter Bob Broeg. Grass would be installed thenafter until the 1980s.\n\nThe highly recognizable rock 'M' of the northern end zone debuted on October 1, 1927, to a 13-6 victory over Kansas State. The monument was built by members of the freshman class using leftover rocks from the original stadium construction. The wide by high 'M' has continued to watch over the field and provide seating for fans since that day.\n\nThe stadium's most historic and identifiable landmark is the rock \"M\" above the stadium's north end zone. The \"M\" is formed by whitewashed rocks and measures 90 feet wide by 95 feet high. The landmark was built in 1927 by a group of freshman students, using leftover rocks from the original construction of Memorial Stadium. This distinctive feature has not been immune to pranks, such as enterprising Nebraska or Kansas fans attempting to change the \"M\" to an \"N\" or a \"K\", but groundskeepers and students have in the past protected the landmark. One of the traditions of the football team is that seniors, after playing their final home game, take a rock from the \"M\" as a souvenir. The rock \"M\" is also whitewashed every year by incoming freshmen during welcoming activities prior to the first home game.\n\nThe \"M-I-Z,\" \"Z-O-U,\" chant came about in 1976 after a game in Columbus, Ohio against Ohio State, famous for its seismic \"OH/IO\" chant. After an unexpectedly stunning 22–21 defeat of the Buckeyes and during the long bus-ride home, Missouri's cheerleaders were determined to come up with a signature chant equally awe-inspiring for home. The nickname, \"Mizzou,\" while quite old and well-known, was not often used to describe the University of Missouri by the late 1970s. Nonetheless Mini-Mizzou member Cedric Lemmie suggested MIZ-ZOU as something that might work and the cheerleaders agreed to devise a plan to get it started. According to Jess Bushyhead, cheerleading varsity co-captain (1976–1978) the plan was implemented during the next home game against the North Carolina Tar Heels on October 2, 1976. During the first half Marching Mizzou split in two and occupied the lower student section and the lower Alumni section. Unfortunately, the attempts were too scrambled and mostly failed to take off. So during halftime, Bushyhead deployed the cheerleaders, megaphones and PA bullhorns in hand, to get up into the stands to instruct alumni, \"When you hear 'MIZ! from the students across the field, answer 'ZOU!\" Students were to listen for that \"ZOU\" from the alumni, then return that with an even louder \"MIZ!\" This tepid start caught fire and by the end of 1976/77 football and basketball seasons, \"MIZ-ZOU\" had entered Missouri legend as the primal scream of Mizzou Pride. Nearly half a century later you can travel almost anywhere in Missouri and yell, \"MIZ!\" and any number of perfect strangers will return \"ZOU!\"\n\nToday the chant is often started by the \"Big MO\" drum (the world's largest marching bass drum). The student section yells out \"M-I-Z\" and the alumni section responds \"Z-O-U\". This tradition has expanded to Tiger first downs; the PA announcer says, \"First down, M-I-Z...\" and the crowd finishes with \"Z-O-U!\"\n\nThroughout its history, numerous expansion and renovation projects have taken place at Faurot Field. Beginning in 1949, MU expanded Memorial Stadium by constructing a second tier of seating above the original 1926 construction. The 1949 construction included seats between the 30 yard lines on the west side and between the south 30 and north 40 yard lines and a new press box on the west side of the stadium. A second project in 1961 filled in the northeast and northwest sections of the second tier and two final projects in 1963 and 1965 completed the second tier construction with new southwest and southeast stands. In 1967 the MU Board of Curators awarded contracts totaling $460,000 for construction of a new three story press box. The new press box was completed for the start of the 1969 season.\n\nIn 1974, Athletic Director Mel Sheehan studied the possibility of lowering the field to add additional seats on each side closer to the sidelines, but the plan did not move forward due to a prevalence of bedrock just below the playing surface.\n\nDuring the summer of 1978, the south end zone (open end of the original horseshoe) was enclosed with 10,800 permanent seats, which brought total permanent seating capacity to 62,023 and overall seating capacity to around 75,000.\n\nOn May 18, 1985, Mizzou replaced the natural grass surface with a new artificial surface called Omniturf, which was also installed at Autzen Stadium (Oregon) and Martin Stadium (Washington State). The conversion was completed on August 30. Mizzou was the last school in the Big Eight Conference to switch from grass to artificial turf. Six of the other seven conference schools switched to artificial turf in the early 1970s, and Iowa State followed suit in 1975 when the Cyclones' new Jack Trice Stadium opened. The first game on the new artificial turf was a 27–23 loss to Northwestern University played on September 14, 1985. The Tigers went on to finish 0–7 at home during the 1985 season. The OmniTurf surface became infamous to Tiger fans as the \"lousy field\" on which The Fifth Down Game was played on October 6, 1990. The surface was also panned by opponents as well. In 1992, Big Eight Conference coaches issued a statement that read, in part: \"Big Eight Conference football coaches wanted to report that the football field at the University of Missouri is a detriment to the home and visiting teams and takes away from the integrity of the game played on such a field.\"\n\nOn September 18, 1994, The Rolling Stones performed, during their Voodoo Lounge Tour, before 45,000 fans at Memorial Stadium in a concert that raised almost $100,000 for the conversion of the Omniturf surface back to natural grass. The final game on the infamous Omniturf surface was played on November 19 of that same year against the University of Kansas, a 31–14 Kansas victory. Mizzou's all-time record on the Omiturf was a disappointing 20–38–3.\n\nThe artificial Omniturf playing surface was removed and replaced with natural grass over the summer of 1995. Legendary Coach Don Faurot put down the last piece of sod as a symbolic gesture. Faurot had helped to lay the sod of the original playing surface in 1926. He died later that year in October, during Homecoming week. As part of the installation of the new playing surface, grass-covered terraces were extended up from the field to the seating area, where they met a new low brick wall that was designed to give Memorial Stadium a traditional college ambiance. The brick wall also honors the greatest figures in Tiger football (including Faurot, Kellen Winslow and Dan Devine) by listing the team's honored numbers on each panel. The first game on the new natural grass resulted in a 28–7 victory for Mizzou over North Texas. The game was also historic as the first game played under permanent lights—previously, night games only were played under temporary lights paid for by television broadcasters, and as part of the renovations four large light stanchions were erected outside each corner of the stadium.\n\nIn 1996, four permanent light towers were installed, allowing Missouri to begin playing night games on a regular basis. The first game under these new lights was on September 14, 1996, when the Memphis Tigers defeated Missouri 19–16.\n\n1997 brought a major renovation that included the installation of the Diamond Vision video board above the Rock \"M\" at the north end zone. The video board measured 21 feet high by 27 feet wide, and the screen utilized Clearvision Signal Processing. The concourses were also refurbished, with new signage and expanded concessions. New ticket booths were constructed, and the north entrance was reconfigured with more brick work to accent the new brick wall installed at field level in 1995.\n\nPrior to the start of the 1999 football season, construction of a new press box and luxury suites began. The $13.1 million 15-story tower was completed in August 2000, and it contained state-of-the-art facilities for the coaches and media, as well as several executive suites, hundreds of premium club seats and a restaurant. FieldTurf replaced the natural grass in 2003. With installation of the new FieldTurf, the traditional \"M\" was removed from the 50 yard line of the field, and it was replaced by the oval \"Power Tiger\" logo at the center of the field.\n\nIn 2005, the south end's antiquated auxiliary scoreboards were replaced with new ones, as well as a second high-definition video monitor.\n\nIn 2009, the university installed a new $5 million 30x80 foot north end zone scoreboard with updated video capabilities and new sound system. The new north end zone video board and audio upgrades replaced the 10-year-old DiamondVision equipment. At the time of construction, it was the fourth largest scoreboard in the Big 12 Conference, behind Godzillatron at Texas' DKR Stadium, the south scoreboard at Owen Field in Norman, Oklahoma, and \"12th Man TV\" at Kyle Field in College Station. When the Tigers entered Southeastern Conference play, the Faurot Field video scoreboard was the ninth largest in the SEC.\n\nIn 2012, Athletic Director Mike Alden announced a $1.5 million modification plan for Faurot Field in anticipation of increased game attendance in the SEC. Changes to the stadium included a redesigned FieldTurf surface featuring a larger \"Power Tiger\" logo at midfield, SEC conference logos, black and gold \"M-I-Z-Z-O-U\" end zone diamonds to replace the previous white \"M-I-S-S-O-U-R-I\" diamonds, and gold trim surrounding the field. Additionally, Marching Mizzou was moved from the south end zone to the southeast corner of the seating bowl, and a \"Touchdown Terrace\" premium seating section was added to the south end zone.\n\nAs part of the entry into the SEC, renovation plans were expanded to increase the current capacity by approximately 6,000 seats at a planned cost of $72 million:\nIn 2013, the west side press box complex was renovated, moving all press facilities to the sixth floor and converting the existing space to new premium suites. In addition, the \"Rock M\" and grass berm were moved closer to the north end zone and the northern concourse was expanded. For the 2014 season, an upper bowl was completed on the east side of the stadium, providing 5,200 general admission seats and 800 club seats as well as adding two elevators, new stairs and a new entryway for the student section.\n\nMizzou approved a renovation of the south end zone, including a new locker room, coaches offices and additional club and general seating at the end of the 2017 season. When finished the overall capacity of the stadium will decrease to roughly 65,000, and will complete before the 2019 season.\n\nThe stadium's current capacity is 60,168, though in the past the stadium has been able to hold more fans. The record attendance for Faurot Field is 75,298 when Missouri hosted Penn State on October 4, 1980.\n\nAll-Time Largest Crowds\n\n\nLargest Crowds since 1995 (when possible seating was reduced to 68,174 capacity from 75,000).

For the 2013 season official seating capacity was decreased to 67,124 while construction of the East side of the stadium was completed. The construction of the upper deck completed for the 2014 season brought the stadium's capacity to 71,168.\n\n\n"}

The stadium serves as a home to the Nigerian national football team, as well as a center for various social, cultural, and religious events. The Federal Government of Nigeria approved the contract for the construction of the National Stadium complex and Games Village on 18 July 2000. The stadium was constructed to host the 8th All Africa Games which took place in October 2003. On 12 June 2019, President Muhammadu Buhari announced the change of the name of the National Stadium, Abuja to Moshood Abiola National Stadium. President Buhari made this pronouncement during his speech at the Democracy Day celebration on Wednesday at the Eagle Square, Abuja.\n\nMoshood Abiola National Stadium is one of the 50 most expensive stadiums ever built in the world.\n\nMoshood Abiola National Stadium main bowl is designed to accommodate 60,491 spectator seats covered by a lightweight roof construction. The main characteristics are the two overlapping spectator tiers; the lower tier accommodating 32,000 seats and the upper tier 28,000 seats. The lower tier also incorporates 56 corporate suites with viewing terraces and one presidential lounge for 50 guests. All functional and secondary areas are accommodated in the entrance building which provides a gross floor area of approximately 25,000 m². This building is arranged below the concourse level which serves as the spectators‘ distribution level and therefore provides several kiosks, banks, first aid stations and toilet buildings. The structure of the stadium is a combination of insitu and precast concrete elements. There are 36 towers supporting the upper tier and the roof structure. These towers are founded on 140 bored piles with diameters of 1.30 m and 1.50 m in a depth of 8.00 m to 30.00 m. Precast concrete elements varying between 13 and 15 meters in length are placed between the towers, forming the spectator stands. A total of 6,300 precast elements were produced in the company’s production yard 15 kilometers away. The towers are connected on the top by a 2.50 m high and 2.00 m wide hollow concrete ring beam with a wall thickness of 0.35 m. The roof structure is fixed on 36 massive concrete points to the ring-beam. For the first time in the world, the ringbeam for this kind of roof structure was made of concrete. The roof structure itself is a cable construction with a weight of 800 tons carrying a 28.000 m² membrane.\n\nAll facilities within the stadium are designed and engineered in compliance with the requirements of international sport associations, particularly the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).\n\nThe complex includes:\n\nMoshood Abiola National Stadium meets the requirements of the International safety standards; it is equipped with emergency service units, closed circuit security cameras as well as crowd control steel fencing. There are also stand-by fire fighting equipment and metal detectors which have been put in place to avoid any misfortunes.\n\nAlthough Nigeria had several stadiums scattered throughout the country, there was a lack of stadiums that met international standards. The capital city of Nigeria, Abuja, was selected to host the 8th All Africa Games in 2000 (a regional multi-sport event held every four years, organized by the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa) despite having no facilities for such a major sporting event. The Federal Government of Nigeria embarked on a multimillion-dollar project for the construction of a state-of-the-art stadium and games village to be completed in time to host the All Africa Games. The contract was awarded on 18 July 2000 from a choice list of about 80 different bidders. Construction of the complex was initiated.\n\nCitizens and athletes had doubts as to whether the completion of the stadium was feasible before the games. However, construction went very smoothly and ended up being ahead of schedule. As a matter of fact, the stadium was scheduled to be the host center for the Miss World Beauty Pageant that took place later in 2002. Unfortunately, the stadium not being fully completed by then as well as an uprising amongst citizens especially in the northern city of Kaduna which resulted in loss of lives forced the pageant to relocate to London, England. The construction of the main bowl went on from its inception in September 2000 to its completion in April 2003, well in time for the games. The Games Village construction went on from September 2000 to August 2003.\n\nThe official commissioning of the complex was on 8 April 2003. Following its commissioning was the final leg of preparations for the games. The games that year were the largest in All Africa Games history; 6,000 athletes from 53 countries competed in 22 sports, watched over by 1,200 officials. Over 1,500 journalists reported for the world's media. The games took place from the 4th to 18 October 2003 and was deemed successful by many. The host country, Nigeria, accumulated a total of 226 medals, emerging as leader of the games that year.\n\nApart from the All African Games, the stadium has hosted important football matches, such as World Cup qualifiers between Nigeria and other countries. The first game played at the stadium was a football (soccer) match between two local rival teams; the Shooting Stars of Ibadan and Sunshine Stars of Akure on 8 April 2003 The first goal scored in the complex was from Shooting Stars' striker Shakiru Lawal who scored the only goal of the game after just five minutes.\n\nThe complex has given the country confidence to bid for various up-coming international events. The Federation of International Volleyball (FIVB) has given the Nigeria Volleyball Federation (NVBF) the provisional hosting rights of the 2007 World Youth Championship because of the facilities the stadium has.\n\nApart from its function as a sports center, Moshood Abiola National Stadium serves as a home to cultural and religious events. Its capacity attracts various events such as concerts, and religious conferences, events which sometimes have preference over sports. Nigeria is a highly religious country with a population split almost equally between Christianity and Islam. Due to this fact, several religious events occur each year that attract a lot of citizens and require a large capacity arena. For example, in September 2006, the Nigeria Football Association was rendered helpless over the Presidency's preference of a religious event in the main bowl of the Moshood Abiola National Stadium to an international football match against Rwanda.\n\nSome citizens are however concerned about the use of the stadium for such large events. Similar events held at the Stadium in Lagos resulted in its demise. The management of the stadium, however, intends to keep these events coming. Cost of maintenance is an issue and renting out the facility for various events is a strategy that has been employed to cover these costs. There were no plans whatsoever by the former military ruler late general Sani Abacha to build a national stadium in Abuja as some people might think.\n\nSeveral issues have risen concerning the maintenance of the sports complex. The National Stadium in Lagos, the most populous and industrialized city in the country, was built for the 1973 All-Africa Games. Though it initially was considered state-of-the-art, it today is considered below any standard facility-wise and environmental-wise. The Nigerian sports boss Amos Adamu advised the government to privatize the Abuja stadium immediately after the 2003 All-Africa Games in order to forestall the vandalisation typical of publicly owned buildings.\n\nThe federal government of Nigeria, who owns 100% equity on the property at the moment, has faced a lot of antagonism both locally and internationally. The average estimate for annual maintenance since its inauguration has been about $7 million, a number considered high by many standards. Due to the high cost of maintenance, the federal government has been seeking options for privatization of the facility. Through the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), the Federal Government of Nigeria intends to grant a concession to a sole Concessionaire who will enter into an investment commitment, and essentially operate the stadium with a primary goal of generating revenue from the proceeds of sporting events, concerts, religious activities, corporate sponsorship, corporate advertising and other promotional activities.\n\nThe Concessionaire has the choice of assuming the role of Facility Manager for the property encompassed in the National Stadium and the Indoor Sports Complex, or employ a firm to perform the task. The BPE will act as the monitor in the arrangement, and the Concessionaire will report to the federal government through the BPE. A minimum tenure of 20 years was recommended, subject to review every five years. Maintenance of the Stadium and its external areas will be the responsibility of the Concessionaire.\n\nOn June 12 2019 President Muhammadu Buhari renamed the national stadium in Abuja after the winner of the 1993 presidential election, Moshood Abiola. It is widely believed that Mr Abiola won the June 1993 presidential election based on available results, but the election was cancelled by the military government of Ibrahim Babangida. President Buhari in 2018 recognised Mr Abiola’s mandate by conferring on him the country’s highest national honour of the Grand Commander of the Federal Republic, reserved only for presidents. While President Muhammadu Buhari was delivering his speech at the change of name event, which also marked Nigeria’s 20th year of uninterrupted democracy, President Buhari said “Henceforth it will be called the Moshood Abiola National Stadium\". The event at the Eagles Square was attended by other foreign leaders, including the president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame.\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "2015525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015525", "title": "Hollingworth Lake", "text": "Hollingworth Lake\n\nHollingworth Lake is a reservoir at Smithy Bridge, in Littleborough – part of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, in Greater Manchester, England. The lake was originally built as the main water source for the Rochdale Canal, but developed as a tourist resort from the 1860s, and became known as the Weighver's Seaport. Hotels were built around it, at least two of which had outdoor dancing stages with gas lighting. Tourism was helped by the arrival of the railway in 1839, which brought day-trippers and weekend visitors from Manchester, Bradford and Leeds.\n\nThe popularity of the lake as a resort declined in the early twentieth century, and the area was used as an army camp during the First World War. The canal company sold the reservoir, with seven others, to the Oldham and Rochdale Corporations for water supply in 1923, by which time the canal was in terminal decline. After the Second World War, boating rights were bought by Rochdale Council, who developed the area into the Hollingworth Lake Country Park in 1974. There has been a steady increase in facilities since, and it is now a thriving centre for water sports and other activities.\n\nThe lake was used for training by Captain Matthew Webb, before he became the first man to swim the English Channel in 1875, and was used for the \"World Professional Mile Championship\", a long-distance swimming event, in the 1880s. It is home to the Hollingworth Lake Rowing Club, which has been in continuous existence since 1872.\n\nIn 1794, an Act of Parliament sanctioned the construction of the Rochdale Canal. Hollingworth Lake with its three earth dams was a main feeder source completed in 1800, four years before the canal. The lake covers an area of and the path around it originally measured . In places the lake was deep, with the average depth being about . When first constructed, it was capable of holding 400 million gallons (1,800 Ml) of water. The site was not a natural choice for a reservoir, as there was no natural hollow and plans exist which indicate the reservoir could have been built in the Ealees Valley which did. Consequently, three large earth embankments were built to enclose the reservoir. The main embankment, Hollingworth Bank, is approximately high and about in length. Fens Bank is high and long while Shaw Moss Bank is high and long. The lake surface is about above sea level, A steam engine was installed to lift water into a channel which fed it into the summit pound at Chelburn. The pumping engine was demolished around 1910.\n\nLocal mill owners feared the canal would take water from the rivers and streams that powered their mills, and succeeded in defeating the first two attempts to obtain an act to authorise building the canal. The third attempt succeeded, largely because the canal company alleviated the millowners' concerns, and the Act contained conditions on the siting of reservoirs, so they would not interfere with water supplies to the River Roch, River Irk or River Medlock. The lake, or \"The Lodge\" when first built, benefitted some millowners by supplying water to mills close to the canal and on the new low-level road from Todmorden to Littleborough. Houses were built for railway workers, reservoir workers, and workers in the new factories and cotton mills. The Lodge became known as The Lake, and became a popular place to walk.\n\nBy the 1920s, the Rochdale Canal was in serious decline, and in 1923 the Oldham and Rochdale Corporations Water Act authorised the sale of Hollingworth Lake and seven other reservoirs in the vicinity to the local authorities for use as a public water supply. The company received £396,667, from which it paid £98,334 to the Manchester Ship Canal Company in compensation for the loss of the water supplied by the Rochdale company, who retained the water rights to certain local streams, and could draw on the reservoirs under certain exceptional circumstances.\n\nA major programme of civil engineering work to strengthen and reshape the earth dams was carried out in 1985. The outlet from the reservoir was rebuilt, and the level of the overflow was reduced. The work cost £2.5 million, and resulted in the lake being closed for leisure activities for almost a year. A ten-year statutory inspection of the reservoir in 2011 identified the need to improve the outflow arrangement so that water levels could be lowered more quickly in an emergency or after heavy rainfall. The £1.25 million project included a concrete tower, with equipment on top raising its height by but concerns expressed by the Friends of Hollingworth Lake and local councillors resulted in a tower half the height of the original design and clad in stone to fit in with the surroundings. The four-month project began in autumn 2011 and the water level was reduced by while the work was in progress, but the lake remained open for watersports.\n\nUnited Utilities is responsible for the maintenance of the reservoir whose main function is to supply water to the Rochdale Canal and has never been used to provide drinking water for the public supply network.\n\nThe area developed rapidly after the arrival of the Manchester and Leeds Railway in 1839, and the construction of Summit Tunnel in 1841, the longest railway tunnel in Europe at that time. In the 1850s, Henry Newall of Harehill, owner of Harehill Woollen Mill and a recently built gasworks, and his engineer, Mr. Sladen, later the landlord of the Mermaid Inn, saw the potential of the lake as a tourist attraction. They leased the lake from the canal company and created novelty amusements and facilities for boating. Despite very cold water and strong undercurrents caused by water entering and leaving the lake, small rowing boats became popular, and two paddle steamers were operated from 1856. By 1860, there was a rowing club, and a regatta was held in 1862. Two hotels, the Beach Hotel and the Lake Hotel and Gardens, catered for day trippers and weekend visitors. The facilities were advertised by the railway companies, who transported visitors to Smithybridge and Littleborough stations, for the short walk to the lake and its facilities.\n\nThe resort became known as the \"Weighver's Seaport\", and Davenport's \"Guide to Hollingworth Lake\", published from 1860 onwards, extolled its virtues in typical Victorian fashion. \".. As you step on the embankment, which is considerable and scarcely looks artificial, the broad expanse of water at once presents itself to your vision. Your first feeling on beholding it is that of astonishment that so vast a basin, lying in that cup of hills, should not have become known to you before. ... You will see Blackstone Edge to the east, towering above its fellows, and preaching from its rocky pulpit sermons to the solitude around.\"\n\nThere were two hotels in the area before the reservoir was built, the Fisherman's Inn, developed from farm buildings at Littleborough, and the Blue Ball at Smithy Bridge, which was demolished and rebuilt in the 1970s. The Beach Hotel built at the start of development had accommodation and refreshment rooms, as well as outdoor platforms illuminated by gaslight which were used for picnic parties and dancing. The Lake Hotel and Pleasure Grounds, to which visitors could walk, travel by carriage around the eastern shore, or cross the lake by steamer, was built in the Swiss style on the opposite side of the lake. The company maintained a booking office at the ferry terminal which was connected to the hotel by a \"Subaqueous Telegraph cable\", laid on the lake bed. Its grounds were designed by Mr Henderson of Birkenhead, and had a bowling green, a croquet lawn, shrubberies and rustic arbours. Refreshments were served in a small building by the water's edge built for the boat club in 1860. Only the foundations of the hotel remain.\n\nThe Mermaid Inn had a 1777 date stone but this was not thought to be original. It closed in 1911. The Lodge Inn at Rakewood provided accommodation and food, and stabling for horses, as did the other hotels. It opened in 1826 and closed in 1917, and became two houses. Peanock Farm, on the south side of the lake, was rebuilt as the Queens Hotel in 1857, and had \"a spacious pavilion and dancing stage in the grounds.\" It has reverted to being a farm. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Hotel, built in 1876, had an outdoor dancing platform covering . When it was demolished, the stone was reused to construct several houses. Now a private house, the Star Inn was in Littleborough near the Fishermans Inn and close to both stations were hotels called the Railway. Smithy Bridge had a beer house called the Royal Oak, and there were unlicensed refreshment rooms around the lake. Many private houses supplied \"tea in jugs and sandwiches\". The resort catered for 6,000 miners, who arrived at the lake on 13 August 1866 for a conference.\n\nIn November 1865, Mr Newhall was notified of \"the immoralities which it is stated take place in connection with the dancing stages at Hollingworth.\" Two months later he replied that if such immoralities were taking place, they were certainly not doing so on any part of the reservoir or land which he was leasing from the canal company.\n\nAt the height of its popularity in the late 19th century, there were three lake steamers, and visitors arrived by trains from Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. The rowing club folded after a few years, and the clubhouse was used by the Lake Hotel for refreshments but the club reformed in 1872 and is still active. Fishing developed after 30,000 fish, mostly bream, dace and perch were introduced in 1863. A variety of stalls and lock-up shops, many close to the landing stage for the ferry, were soon trading in sweets, snacks and souvenirs, and on special holidays, there were fortune tellers, conjurers and tricksters. Although photography was in its infancy there were six businesses listed in Davenport's Guide as taking photographic portraits of visitors. Other attractions included a camera obscura, a stereoscopic exhibition, and a gymnasium, which was attached to the Beach Hotel. A roundabout with galloping horses, powered successively by a hand winch, a steam engine, a gas engine and finally electricity, remained at the lake until after the Second World War.\n\nThe lake's surface froze to a sufficient thickness to allow activities on the ice in 1860 and 1864, when over 2,000 people were recorded as skating. Teams from Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester used the lake for curling matches, and local teams even played cricket. Cricket was played in 1871, and in the 20th century the lake froze in 1902, 1907, 1924, 1929, 1941 and 1947. The lake almost dried up in 1934, when the water level dropped so low that stone farm buildings which had not been seen since 1800 became visible.\n\nThe fortunes of the resort improved in 1883, after a law was passed allowing boats to operate on Sundays. Huge crowds flocked to the lake, although a claim of 40,000 visitors on one occasion may be an exaggeration. Swimming became popular, despite the cold water, perhaps inspired by Captain Matthew Webb, who used the lake for training before becoming the first man to swim the English Channel from Dover to Calais in 1875. He competed against G A Jennings of Tunbridge Wells in a 5-hour endurance swim in 1881. Regular swimming competitions were held from 1882, including the mile championship. The distance was covered in 26 minutes 8 seconds by a local man named Joseph Nuttall when he swam against McCusker from the United States, in the \"World Professional Mile Championship\", allegedly watched by a crowd of 20,000.\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, travel was easier, people took longer holidays, and the lake's attraction started to diminish. Some hotels closed and the Beach Hotel burned down in 1901 although it was rebuilt. The stunts and shows stopped and by the start of the First World War the lake was in decline. There was an upsurge in activity when a training camp for the Manchester Regiment was set up in the Ealees Valley and the hotels and local houses accommodated wives and visitors. Most soldiers from the camp were sent to the Dardanelles, but few returned as many were killed on the beaches when they tried to land. After that war, the rowing club developed and the lake was used for sailing. Day visitors could hire rowing or motor boats, but only the Fisherman's Inn and the Beach Hotel remained open.\n\nIn 1950, the boating rights which had been held by the Water Board since 1923 were taken over by Rochdale Council, who also planned to turn the area into a country park in 1974. Ten years later, it was in a list of the top ten country parks in England. It is now used for recreation and includes a wildlife sanctuary. Currently there are two public houses by the lake, the Beach Hotel and the Wine Press, which was formerly the Fisherman's Inn.\n\nThe lake supports watersports like sailing, windsurfing, canoeing, swimming, rafting, rowing and fishing. Since 1989, Hollingworth Lake Water Activity Centre has offered tuition in outdoor activities, including kayaking, canoeing, power boating and sailing. In summer, visitors can hire rowing boats. The centre used to operate a launch \"The Lady Alice\" at weekends during the summer months to provide trips around the lake, but the boat has been out of service since 2009 as it required a major refit. A new pleasure boat, \"The Lady Katherine\" was launched in May 2019.\n\nThe scenic walk, around the lake, passes a nature reserve with a bird hide in the south-western corner of the lake, in an area from which boats and watersports are excluded. The lake provides habitat for a variety of wildlife and is used for fishing. The variety of fish has been expanded by stocking the lake with carp, tench and roach, in addition to those introduced in 1863. The country park is used for activities for children, who catch various types of pond life. The path around the lake is a gravel track from the Beach Hotel to the far side of the Lake, and then follows Rakewood Road and Hollingworth Road. A children's playground and trim trail for adults known as the Woodland Enviro Gym situated where the path joins Rakewood Road, was opened on 7 August 2010. The facility was funded by the Big Lottery Community Spaces fund, and was the idea of the Friends of Hollingworth Lake, a group working to improve the facilities, which was set up as an informal society in November 2007, but was registered as a private company limited by guarantee in May 2010 to enable it to handle grant applications.\n\nLake users have included:\n\nTo the east, a visitor centre shows children's artwork and objects found in the lake. The annual Easter fun fair runs from the Thursday before Easter until the following Sunday, on a car park by the lake.\n\nThe lake and its surroundings are served by the Smithy Bridge and Littleborough railway stations, which link west to Rochdale, Oldham and Manchester, and east to West Yorkshire. Smithy Bridge station stands beside a barrier-operated level crossing.\n\nHollingworth Lake is served by buses from Rochdale including the 455 (Rochdale, Smallbridge, Hollingworth Lake and Littleborough), and the 456 (Rochdale, Wardle and Hollingworth Lake).\n\nIt is easily accessible by road from junction 21 of the M62 motorway (via the A640 and B6225 roads) and has three pay and display car parks.\n\n"}

{"id": "2015550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015550", "title": "Brian Sipe", "text": "Brian Sipe\n\nBrian Winfield Sipe (born August 8, 1949) is a former professional American football quarterback who played for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) from 1974 to 1983. He then played in the United States Football League for two seasons.\n\nAlthough mostly sidelined for the first several years of his NFL career, Sipe was eventually recognized as one of the better quarterbacks in Browns history, winning the league's MVP Award in 1980. He was a college football star under head coach Don Coryell at San Diego State University, where he studied architecture and became the team's quarterbacks coach in 2009, remaining in that role for five years, through 2014. He also competed in the 1961 Little League World Series for El Cajon, California, and prepped at Grossmont High School.\n\nDrafted in the 13th round of the 1972 NFL Draft by the Cleveland Browns, Sipe spent the first two years of his career as a member of the team's reserve squad, seeing no action on the field.\n\nIn 1974, Sipe started four games after helping the Browns come back from a 12-point deficit against the Denver Broncos on October 27. However, after winning just one of the four contests (a 21-14 victory against the New England Patriots on November 11), he was replaced by Mike Phipps.\n\nThe team's disastrous 1975 season saw Sipe enter the starting lineup after three consecutive losses in which the Browns were outscored 124-26. Sipe's three starts reduced the margin of defeat for the squad, but still resulted in a trio of defeats, sending him back to the sidelines. The following year, he finally moved into a consistent starting role following an opening game injury to Phipps on September 12, 1976. As the team's signal caller that season, he led them to a 9-5 record, a six-game improvement over the previous season. 1976 was the team's second year under head coach Forrest Gregg.\n\nDuring the first half of the 1977 season, he led the team to five wins in their first seven games. However, on November 13 of that year, Sipe suffered a season-ending shoulder injury at Three Rivers Stadium against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second quarter of the team's 35-31 defeat. With Phipps gone to the Chicago Bears, the Browns turned to back-up quarterback Dave Mays, who went 1-3 as a starter. The 1977 also saw a head coaching change as Gregg was fired and defensive coordinator Dick Modzelewski took over for the final game. Sipe came back the following year to throw for more than 2,900 yards and 21 touchdown passes, but the team's overall inconsistency resulted in an 8-8 finish.\n\nServing as the catalyst for many thrilling moments during the 1979 and 1980 seasons, Sipe helped the team earn the nickname \"Kardiac Kids.\" The designation was in recognition of their tendency to produce heart-stopping comeback victories in the final minutes of many games. Over the course of these two seasons, Sipe led the Browns to eight comebacks and eleven game-winning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime.\n\nSipe lead Cleveland to a 4-0 start in 1979, including a season opening overtime win over the New York Jets.\n\nIn 1980, Sipe passed for 4,132 yards and 30 touchdowns, helping to lead the Browns to their first postseason berth since 1972. Individually, his efforts earned him the NFL MVP award and a selection to the 1981 Pro Bowl.\n\nAt the end of the divisional playoff game the Browns played against the Raiders following the 1980 NFL season, the Browns trailed the Raiders with a score of 14-12. After the Browns forced the Raiders to turn the ball over on downs on their own 15-yard line, Sipe led the Browns back down the field, reaching the Raiders 13-yard line in 9 plays. With just 49 seconds remaining, the Browns could have settled for a game-winning field goal, but due to the brutally cold and windy weather in Cleveland that day (which rendered a field goal attempt significantly more risky) Browns head coach Sam Rutigliano instead opted to pass the ball. Sipe attempted a pass to Browns Hall of Fame tight end Ozzie Newsome, but it was intercepted in the end zone by Raiders safety Mike Davis. That play brought the Browns' season to a heartbreaking close, while the Raiders went on to win Super Bowl XV over the Philadelphia Eagles. The play call - \"Red Right 88\" - would be immortalized in Cleveland sports infamy.\n\nDespite throwing for 3,876 yards the following year, Sipe was at the controls as the team staggered to a 5-11 mark. In 1982, Sipe and the Browns won just two of the team's first six games in the strike-marred NFL season, and Sipe was benched in favor of third-year signal caller Paul McDonald.\n\nSipe regained his starting role the following year, but angered Browns management by negotiating with New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League (USFL) during the season. Sipe finished the season with 3,566 passing yards and 26 touchdown passes. Sipe had led Cleveland to a 9–7 record and the team just missed qualifying for the AFC playoffs. He then signed with the Generals and played for them in 1984, before concluding his career with the Jacksonville Bulls in 1985.

This causes the vein to contract, and the optical fiber is slowly withdrawn. Some minor complications can occur, including thrombophlebitis, pain, hematoma, edema and infection, which can lead to cellulitis.\n\nEVLT has the same meaning as ELT, but it is a trademark name owned by Diomed and used as the name for their 910 nm laser treatment unit for ELT. The 810 nm laser is the original laser fiber wavelength as pioneered by Dr. Robert Min of New York, USA. Subsequently, various other fibers with different wavelengths have become available. The varying wavelength each aim to maximize local damage to a component of the varicose vein or the blood contained in it while minimizing damage to adjacent tissues.\n\nDuring the procedure, a catheter bearing a laser fiber is inserted under ultrasound guidance into the great saphenous vein (GSV) or small saphenous vein (SSV) through a small puncture. The catheter is then advanced, also under ultrasound guidance, to the level of the groin or knee crease. Dilute local anesthesia is injected around and along the vein (perivascular infiltration) using ultrasound imaging to place the local anesthetic solution around the vein, mostly in a sub-facial location. This technique derives from the tumescent local anesthesia (TLA) method long used and proven safe and effective for some methods of liposuction. The laser is activated whilst the catheter or laser fiber is slowly withdrawn, resulting in obliteration of the saphenous vein along its entire length. The treatment, which is performed without sedation, usually takes between 1 and two hours, and the patient walks out under his or her own power. The leg is bandaged and/or placed in a stocking that the patient wears for up to three weeks afterwards.\n\nFoam sclerotherapy or ambulatory phlebectomy is often performed at the time of the procedure or within the first 1–2 weeks to treat branch varicose veins. However, some physicians do not perform these procedures at the time of the ELT because the varicose veins can improve on their own as a result of reduced reflux from the great saphenous vein.\n\nComplications of endovenous laser treatment can be categorized as minor, or serious. Minor complications include bruising (51%), hematoma (2.3%), temporary numbness (3.8%), phlebitis (7.4%), induration (46.7%), and a sensation of tightness (24.8%). More serious complications include skin burns (0.5%), deep venous thrombosis (0.4%), pulmonary embolism (0.1%), and nerve injury (0.8%). These rates of complications are derived from the Australian MSAC review of all available literature on the procedure.\nRetinal damage is a serious but very rare complication (<1%) that can occur during the use of lasers. If the fiber breaks or if the laser is activated when the laser is outside of the body, reflected laser light may cause a focal permanent retinal deficit or \"blind spot\" or scotoma. The nominal hazard zone (NHZ) or space within which the level of direct, scattered, or reflected laser radiation exceeds the maximum permissible exposure (MPE), varies by the wavelength of the laser and is shorter (17 inches) with the newer 1470 nm laser. Use of appropriate protective eyeware specific to the wavelength laser being used prevents accidental injury.\n\nA 2005 report from one practice, summarising results of 1,000 limbs treated over a 5-year period with EVLT showed that 98% of the treated vessels at up to 60 months follow-up remained closed, with complications and side effects such as temporary parasthesia and DVTs below 0.5%.\n\nThe Australian Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) in 2008 has determined that endovenous laser treatment for varicose veins \"appears to be more effective in the short term, and at least as effective overall, as the comparative procedure of junction ligation and vein stripping for the treatment of varicose veins.\" It also found in its assessment of available literature, that \"occurrence rates of more severe complications such as DVT, nerve injury and paresthesia, post-operative infections and hematomas, appears to be greater after ligation and stripping than after EVLT\". A study of 516 treated veins over 69 months by Elmore and Lackey reported a success rate of 98.1%.\n\nEndovenous thermal ablation (EVTA) by radiofrequency or laser is a safe and effective treatment of refluxing great saphenous veins (GSVs) and has replaced traditional high ligation and stripping in official recommendations of various leading Vascular Societies in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nPatients are usually fitted with Class 2 graduated compression stockings and/or bandages for up to 3 weeks. Duplex ultrasound is used during follow-up to assess the success of treatment and if there is a need for additional sclerotherapy or phlebectomy of branch veins.\n\n\n"}

This serial introduced Kamelion, voiced by Gerald Flood, as a companion.\n\nThe serial is set in an English castle in 1215. In the serial, the alien time traveller the Master (Anthony Ainley) uses the robot Kamelion to imitate King John of England as part of the Master's plot to have the real King John overthrown and thus preventing the signing of Magna Carta.\n\nIn 1215, the Court of King John of England is at the castle of Sir Ranulf Fitzwilliam to extort more taxes, and when the lord refuses to pay the King insults him. To defend his honour his son Hugh takes on the King’s champion, Sir Gilles Estram, in a joust. The latter wins easily, though the joust is disturbed by the arrival of the TARDIS. The Fifth Doctor, Tegan, and Turlough are greeted as demons and welcomed by the King.\n\nHaving established the date, the Doctor concludes the King is not himself – in fact, he is not the King at all, as he is actually in London taking the Crusader’s Oath. Sir Geoffrey de Lacy, the cousin of Sir Ranulf, arrives at the castle and confirms he knows the King is in London. Sir Gilles is about to torture him as a liar during a royal banquet when the Doctor intervenes. It seems the King's champion is not who he claims to be, either: Sir Gilles sheds his disguise and reveals himself to be the Doctor’s nemesis, the Master. He flees in his own TARDIS, which had been disguised as an iron maiden.\n\nThe King knights the Doctor as his new champion, and he is given run of the castle. After a series of mishaps, including the death of Sir Geoffrey at the Master’s hands, the Doctor confronts the King and the Master and discovers the truth. The monarch is really Kamelion, a war weapon found by the Master on Xeriphas, which can be mentally controlled and used to adopt disguises and personas. Disguised as King John, the Master intends that Kamelion will behave so appallingly so as to provoke a rebellion and topple the real King from his throne, thus robbing the world of Magna Carta, the foundation of parliamentary democracy. It is a small plan on the Master’s usual scale, but nevertheless particularly poisonous to the normal progress of Earth society.\n\nThe Doctor resolves the situation by testing the Master in a battle of wills for control over Kamelion. He takes control of the robot and steals it away in the TARDIS, thus foiling the Master’s scheme. Kamelion reverts to its robot form and thanks the Doctor for his assistance and rescue.\n\nThe story was repeated on BBC1 on consecutive Fridays 6–13 July 1984, achieving viewing figures of 3.3 and 5.0 million respectively.\nThe working titles for this story were \"The Android\", \"The Demons\", \"A Knight's Tale\" and \"Demons Keeper\". Part One of this story was billed by the BBC as the six hundredth episode of \"Doctor Who\".\n\nThis story marked the first appearance of Kamelion as voiced by Gerald Flood. Freelance effects designer Richard Gregory and software designer Mike Power gave a demonstration of the robot prototype for Nathan-Turner and Saward. Nathan-Turner was so impressed he commissioned scriptwriter Terence Dudley to develop a storyline to introduce Kamelion into the series. Shortly after filming, however, Power died in a boating accident and no one was able to continue his work. Subsequently, Kamelion made only two appearances before being written out of the series.\n\nIn the story, the Master disguises himself as Sir Gilles Estram, Estram being an anagram of \"Master\". To hide Ainley's return, Sir Gilles was credited in the \"Radio Times\" as having been played by \"James Stoker\", an anagram of \"Master's Joke\".\n\nThis story marks the last appearance of the TARDIS console room set, which had been in use since \"The Invisible Enemy\". A new console room would debut in the next story, \"The Five Doctors\", although the console itself would be reused as the Second Doctor's console in \"The Two Doctors\".\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terence Dudley, was published by Target Books in February 1986.\n\n\"The King's Demons\" was released on VHS in November 1995 in a box set along with a special edition of the subsequent serial \"The Five Doctors\" and a postcard book. It and \"Planet of Fire\" were released in a Kamelion-themed DVD box set on 14 June 2010.\n"}

Studies have shown that regular consumption of boiled coffee increases serum cholesterol whereas filtered coffee does not. Cafestol may act as an agonist ligand for the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor and pregnane X receptor, blocking cholesterol homeostasis. Thus cafestol can increase cholesterol synthesis.\n\nCafestol has also shown anticarcinogenic properties in rats.\n\nCafestol also has neuroprotective effects in a \"Drosophila\" fruit fly model of Parkinson's disease.\n\n"}

{"id": "2015570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015570", "title": "Oscillococcinum", "text": "Oscillococcinum\n\nOscillococcinum (or Oscillo) is a homeopathic preparation fraudulently marketed to relieve flu-like symptoms. It does not provide any benefit beyond that of sugar pills. It is a popular preparation, particularly in France and Russia. \n\nOscillococcinum is promoted according to the disproven homeopathic principle that \"like cures like\" and that a disease can be cured by small amounts of the substance that cause similar symptoms. Boiron is its sole manufacturer. Oscillococcinum is used in more than 50 countries and has been in production for over 65 years.\n\nOscillococcinum was originally proposed by the French physician Joseph Roy, based on his misidentification of a supposed oscillating bacterium he named \"oscillococcus\" in victims of the Spanish flu epidemic of 1917–1918. Roy said he had seen the same bacterium in cancer sufferers, and proposed a homeopathic preparation (which he claimed to have isolated in a duck) as a remedy for the Spanish flu. The microbes Roy said he saw have never been independently observed by any other researcher. In addition, it is now known that influenza is caused by a virus and not a bacterium.\n\nThe preparation is derived from duck liver and heart, diluted to 200C—a ratio of one part duck offal to 10 parts water. Homeopaths claim that the molecules leave an \"imprint\" in the dilution that causes a healing effect on the body, although there is no evidence that supports this mechanism or efficacy beyond placebo.\n\nThe word \"Oscillococcinum\" was coined by the French physician Joseph Roy (1891–1978) in his 1925 book \"Towards Knowledge and the Cure of Cancer\". Roy wrote that while on military duty during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1917 he had observed an oscillating bacterium in the blood of flu victims, which he named \"Oscillococcus\".\n\nRoy subsequently claimed to have observed the microbe in the blood of patients that had viral diseases like herpes, chicken pox, and shingles. He thought it to be the causative agent of diseases as varied as eczema, rheumatism, tuberculosis, measles, and cancer. Roy searched for the \"bacterium\" in several animals until he felt that he had found it on the liver of a Long Island duckling. Believing he had also detected it in the blood of cancer patients, he tried a vaccine-like therapy on them, which was unsuccessful.\n\nThe microbe has never been independently observed by another researcher, and it remains unclear what, if anything, Roy actually saw. Moreover, medical science has since disproved Roy's \"universal germ\" theory: rheumatism, for example, is not caused by bacteria, and measles is caused by a virus far too small for Roy to have observed in his optical microscope.\n\nThe modern preparation is created from the heart and liver of Muscovy duck (see the preparation section for the details).\n\nIn France, the selling of all products manufactured according to the Korsakovian principle of dilution was forbidden until 1992, with the exception of Oscillo, thanks to a special measure made for it. , Oscillococcinum was one of the top ten selling drugs in France, was publicised widely in the media, and was being prescribed for both flu and the common cold. As of 2008 it sells US$15 million per year in the U.S., and it also sells widely in Europe.\n\nThe ingredients of a one-gram tube of Oscillococcinum are listed as follows:\n\n\nThe 200CK indicates that the preparation entails a series of 200 dilutions of the starting ingredient, an extract from the heart and liver of a Muscovy duck. Each step entails a 1:100 dilution, where the first mixture contains 1% of the extract, the second contains 1% of the first mixture, etc. The K indicates that it is prepared by the Korsakovian method, in which rather than 1% of the preparation being measured out at each stage and then diluted, a single vessel is repeatedly emptied, refilled, and vigorously shaken (in homeopathic terminology \"succussed\"), and it is assumed that 1% remains in the vessel each time. The 200C dilution is so extreme that the final pill contains none of the original material.\n\nOscillococcinum is generally considered harmless. When Boiron (the company that makes oscillococcinum) spokeswoman Gina Casey was asked if a product made from the heart and liver of a duck was safe, she replied: \"Of course it is safe. There's nothing in it.\"\n\nThere is no compelling scientific evidence that Oscillococcinum has any effect beyond placebo. None of its active ingredient is present in a dose of the final product, nor is there any credible evidence that duck liver is effective in relieving (or causing) flu symptoms in the first place. Homeopaths claim the diluted molecules leave an \"imprint\" in the remedy, but there is no known mechanism for how this could occur. Homeopathy as a whole is widely considered to be pseudoscience.\n\nAs Robert L. Park, a critic of alternative medicine, explains, some of the characteristics of flu may suggest that Oscillococcinum works. Since the flu normally goes away on its own in a variable number of days, the natural course of the disease is a potential source of error in assessing the efficacy of any intervention: if one takes any medication, and then one's flu goes away, there is a tendency to attribute this to the medication even though the infection would have resolved anyway, which is an example of the informal fallacy \"post hoc ergo propter hoc\". Someone who gets over a mild strain of flu may attribute the mildness to the efficacy of the homeopathic preparation and not to the fact that it was a mild strain, and might recommend it to other people, spreading its popularity. Also, the most likely explanation for its effectiveness with flu symptoms is that patients are misdiagnosing the symptoms of several rhinovirus diseases or of allergies to several hundred substances, and attributing them to a flu infection that they do not have.\n\nA 2005 review of flu treatments (vaccine, medicine, homeopathy) has concluded that the popularity of Oscillococcinum in France was unsupported by any evidence of efficacy.\n\nIn a 2007 review, the effectiveness of non-mainstream remedies against seasonal flu could not be established beyond reasonable doubt, and the evidence is found to be sparse and limited by \"small sample sizes, low methodological quality, or clinically irrelevant effect sizes\", and that the results strengthen using conventional approaches for flu.\n\nA Cochrane review published in December 2015 found that there was insufficient evidence to make a conclusion about whether Oscillococcinum is useful for influenza.\n\nThe non-profit educational organizations Center for Inquiry (CFI) and the associated Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) have petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), criticizing Boiron for misleading labeling and advertising of Oscillococcinum. \"One petition complains that Boiron’s packaging for Oscillococcinum lists the alleged active ingredient – duck liver and heart – in Latin only. Another petition complains that Boiron’s web ad for this product implies that it has received FDA approval.\" Ronald Lindsay, CFI and CSI president and chief executive officer, contends, \"If Boiron is going to sell snake oil, the least they can do is use English on their labels.”\n\nA class action lawsuit was filed against Boiron on behalf of \"all California residents who purchased Oscillo at any time within the past four years.\" The lawsuit charges that Boiron \"falsely advertises that Oscillo has the ability to cure the flu because it contains an active ingredient it claims is proven to get rid of flu symptoms in 48 hours.\" The lawsuit also states that the listed active ingredient in Oscillococcinum (Oscillo) \"is actually Muscovy Duck Liver and Heart ... and has no known medicinal quality.\" A settlement was reached, with Boiron denying any wrongdoing and agreeing to make several changes to its marketing of the product. These changes include adding to their packaging notices like \"These ‘Uses’ have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration\" and \"C, K, CK, and X are homeopathic dilutions.\"\n\nSince 2011, at least two class action lawsuits on behalf of customers who purchased Oscillococcinum have been filed against Boiron in the United States, alleging that Boiron falsely advertises that Oscillo has the ability to cure the flu. A proposed settlement was reached in August 2012. While the settlement was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit by one class member who opposed the settlement, on February 24, 2015 the Ninth Circuit issued a decision upholding approval of the class action settlement.\n\nBoiron's legal threats against Samuele Riva for writing criticisms on his website were rebuffed by his web hosting company, and the debacle was described as producing a Streisand effect against Boiron.\n\n"}
