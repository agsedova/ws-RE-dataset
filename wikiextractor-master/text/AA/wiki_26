He was a member of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, served as the Chair of the (TUC) International Committee, a member of the National Economic Development Council and president of the Trade Union Unity Trust and was an honorary vice-president of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He was a committed Internationalist, a relentless campaigner for Nuclear disarmament and an active campaigner in the Anti-Apartheid Movement, who counted Nelson Mandela as a close friend.\n\nHe was one of the most respected union officials of his generation and led the biggest trade union in the country during most of the Margaret Thatcher years, a period that could be counted as one of the most difficult ones for the trade union movement in the 20th century.\n\nBorn in Walthamstow, London, the fifth child of Emily (\"née\" Pauline) and George Thomas Todd. His father was a stallholder in a local street market and his mother was a pianist who accompanied silent film. Owing to his mother's influence Ron grew up with a love of Victorian ballads and music hall songs and became an accomplished pianist himself. The family was Roman Catholic and Ron attended St Patrick's school, where he was an altar boy. As an altar boy he accidentally set fire to a priest's cassock during the stations of the cross, as penance he was forced to recite many Ave Marias while the school prayed for him, receiving the occasional smack from the attendant nuns.\n\nDuring the war, a German bomb that landed on the family’s air-raid shelter knocked Todd out cold. When he came round, he and his mother sang for two hours before they were dug out. Ron left school at the age of 14 to sweep floors in a barber's shop, he then worked as a plumber's mate. In 1945 at the age of 18 he married Josephine Tarrant, in the same year he got a call up to the Royal Marines, in order to be chosen as a national service Royal Marine a young man had to be tough, and tough he certainly was. He had initially favoured the Royal Navy, but he later recalled with pride that he and his father were the first father and son in the Marines to appear on the parade ground together. For a time he served alongside his father in the Marines when they were posted to Hong Kong with 42 Commando. While in the Far East he took part in the liberation of British, Australian, New Zealand and some American troops from Japanese prisoner-of-war-camps, and then guarded captured Japanese. Ron was deeply effected by the social divisions and poverty he witnessed while in Hong Kong, and this led him to question his Roman Catholic faith, which he ultimately lost, becoming a socialist. He said later: \"I began to think ‘Where’s the power of prayer now?’ I became convinced that the only route to people’s improvement was through collective action.\"\n\nOn demobilisation in 1947, he returned home and worked in the Labour Party (UK) for his local MP - the Prime Minister Clement Attlee. It was typical that Attlee should encourage a young worker, whom Major Attlee admired as a marine commando. Todd became a gas fitter in Walthamstow, but then in 1955 a family and a mortgage tempted him to go to the new Ford plant to work as an engineer. During his working days on the Ford assembly line at Dagenham, his elder brother was a supervisor while Ron remained a shopfloor \"spanner-and-screwdriver\" man on the line before becoming deputy convenor of Ford shop stewards. One day his brother suggested a way in which Ron could increase his earnings by accepting overtime and dodging the occasional night shift. The younger Todd told his brother to \"bugger off\" - or words to that effect in much stronger language. As a matter of course he joined a union, the Transport and General Workers' Union.\n\nNot long after starting work at the Ford plant his natural leadership qualities shone through and he became a shop steward and soon deputy convener of shop stewards. In the year 1962, he became a full-time T&G officer based at the Edmonton office and was responsible for chemical, engineering and metal groups. So effective was he that the discerning General Secretary of the T&G, Jack Jones, moved Todd to the Stratford office, so that he could take charge of the interests of workers at the Dagenham plant. Recognised as a mighty effective negotiator, who tended to avoid any gratuitous strike action, Todd was made Regional Secretary for London and the South-East in 1975 and responsible for half a million or more members. He became friendly with Moss Evans, then responsible for the motor industry, and in 1978 to succeed Jones as General Secretary. Evans appointed Todd as National Organiser, at the centre of the T&G high command.\n\nIt was as National Organiser that Todd became a household name as the officer in charge of the Ford pay negotiations at the fag end of the Callaghan government in the autumn of 1978. He won a 17 per cent pay rise, so driving a coach and horses through the Government's pay norm of 5 per cent. Jim Callaghan was faced with a Commons vote of confidence in the Government's pay policy. Evans and Todd passionately believed that they were correct to put the interests of their members before the entreaties of Labour ministers. Todd was adamant that it is the function of trade unions to negotiate on behalf of their members and that it was Labour ministers by their actions who had destroyed the Labour government, and not the trade unions, in the aftermath of the Winter of Discontent, 1978-79.\n\nTodd had assumed that National Organiser would be his last job and that he would retire at the same moment as Moss Evans. Fate took a different turn. Evans gave up due to ill-health and retired to King's Lynn in Norfolk, persuading Ron to stand for election as General Secretary.\n\nAfter being elected to succeed Moss Evans as the union's seventh general secretary in 1985, following a second ballot, he was also named as an honorary vice-president of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Todd earned a reputation for his commitment to human rights and was a vocal opponent of apartheid in South Africa.\n\nIn demanding such a vote he had two objectives in mind - to stymie the Daily Mail and the Daily Express from making the most of allegations of wrongdoing to drag the Transport and General Workers' name into the dirt; and to stop the George Wright faction on his own executive using the allegations against him. His behaviour enhanced his authority.\n\nRon's final move before he retired was to pave the way for his successor, Bill Morris, the first black leader of a major British trade union. That, in itself, was an epitaph characteristic of the man.\n\nOn his retirement Todd, a great royalist, was proud to receive a congratulatory telegram from the Queen Mother, in her capacity as an honorary member of the union's branch at Smithfield meat market. Asked how he would like his stewardship of the TGWU to be remembered, he said: \"I would want the rank-and-file to say 'He stayed true to the basic values of trade unionism'.\"\n\nIn 1995 he helped form the Romford & District Royal Marines Association and was its first chairman. He devoted some of his time in retirement to working with the deaf, for which he learnt sign language. He also published fives books of poetry, proceeds of which he donated to charities, he was writing his poems on current affairs up to his final months.\n\nIn his retirement he refused all honours, repeatedly turning down the opportunity to become a member of the House of Lords\n\nOn 30 April 2005 Ron Todd lost his battle with leukaemia, from which he had been suffering for some time. He was survived by three children, one son and two daughters and five grandchildren.\n\nUpon his death the T&G issued the following statement:\n\n\"Ron Todd's passing is a sad blow for the T&G. Ron carried the trade union flame throughout the darkest days of Thatcherism, leading the T&G in very difficult years with decency, integrity and commitment. Ron always put the members' interests first, and remained rock-solid to the end in his loyalty to the enduring values of the labour movement. His passing will be mourned not just by his family and by trade unionists throughout Britain, but also in South Africa, where his campaigning lead against apartheid will always be remembered. So too will his unwavering commitment to nuclear disarmament. In saluting his memory, the T&G pledges to stay true to Ron Todd's principles.\"\n\nTributes were paid to him from leading figures across the labour movement, these were led by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair who said: “He was a greatly respected trade union leader and a good friend. Despite leading his union at a difficult time he was always a strong supporter of the Labour Party. I have always been grateful for the support he gave me in difficult circumstances when I was employment spokesman when we were changing the party’s position on employment law. He will be sadly missed.” Tony Woodley remarked: \"“Ron carried the trade union flame throughout the darkest days of Thatcherism, leading the T&G in very difficult years with decency, integrity and commitment. Ron always put the members’ interests first and remained rock solid to the union in his loyalty to the enduring values of the Labour movement. His passing will be mourned not just by his family and by trade unionists throughout Britain but also in South Africa where his campaigning commitment against apartheid will always be remembered. So too will be his unwavering commitment to nuclear disarmament.” Brendan Barber, the then general secretary of the TUC said: “Ron Todd was a trade unionist of total integrity, passion and commitment to fairness for working people as well as having a deep commitment to the cause of peace.” Ken Livingstone the then Mayor of London remarked: “Ron Todd was one of the most decent men I have ever met in public life. He was a man of absolute integrity, a giant of the trade union movement and everyone will miss him and his advice immensely. \"Ron was a great ally in the London Labour Party and it was only because of his key role over many years that London Labour had such a radical agenda when we won the GLC elections in 1981. He was both a powerful advocate of the interests of working people and a kind and generous man.” While Tony Benn said: 'He was a great campaigner for peace, a very principled man and a very likable man.'\n\nHis funeral was held at Dagenham & Redbridge F.C.Victoria Road ground on 10 May 2005. There was a London Bus laid on and trade unionists with their banners lined the streets, the Romford & District Royal Marines Association and the Royal Navy Association formed a guard of honour as his coffin entered the packed-out hall. Gordon Brown, John Prescott and Tony Benn were some of the recognisable faces among the many attendees.\n\nUnite the Union London and Eastern branch office was named in his honour, as Ron Todd House.\n\nA street is named after him in Dagenham, Ron Todd Close.\n\nThere is an annual lecture in his memory called the Ron Todd Memorial Lecture.\n\nA social enterprise called Community Court Yard was founded to further his principles and beliefs.\n\nA registered charity called the Ron Todd Foundation continues to fight on the issues that were important to him, and to keep his memory alive.\n\nCommunity Court Yard is a social enterprise founded by Ron Todd's family, and run by his grand daughter Bianca Todd. The organisation was founded on 7 July 2011.\n\nThe Ron Todd Memorial Lecture is an annual event put on by the Ron Todd Foundation in order to memorialise the work and life of Ron Todd. At the lecture the Ron Todd Awards are given out to individuals and groups that have contributed to their communities.\n\nThe Ron Todd Foundation is a registered charity founded by Ron Todd's grand daughter Bianca Todd on 2 September 2016. It was created to build on the work started by Community Court Yard\n\n"}

The seat is one of three held by the Labour candidate in 2019 from a total of ten in Leicestershire. Since the seat was recreated in 1974, it returned twice members of other parties from 1981 until 1987 (a mixed pattern of results similar to its earlier incarnation) and since 1987 has returned Labour's candidate. In 2019 Labour held the seat with a substantially reduced majority of 6,019, down from 22,428 in the previous election just 2 years earlier.\n\n1918–1950: The County Borough of Leicester wards of Belgrave, Latimer, Spinney Hill, and West Humberstone.\n\n1974–1983: The County Borough of Leicester wards of Belgrave, Charnwood, Evington, Humberstone, and Latimer.\n\n1983–2010: The City of Leicester wards of Belgrave, Charnwood, Coleman, Evington, Humberstone, Latimer, Rushey Mead, Thurncourt, and West Humberstone.\n\n2010–present: The City of Leicester wards of Belgrave, Charnwood, Coleman, Evington, Humberstone & Hamilton, Latimer, Rushey Mead, and Thurncourt.\n\nThis is an urban seat in the commercial and engineering centre of Leicester. The seat excludes the heart of the city centre, skirting its tightly planned ring road. A golf course is situated in the south-east and a large municipal garden in the north-west of the boundaries.\n\nLeicester East has a relatively high Asian population. In the 2011 census two-thirds of the population were non-white and 48.5% of people described themselves as Asian. Almost a third of the population are Hindu and the majority of others of Asian ethnicity are of Muslim or Sikh faiths. Those of mixed ethnicities are gradually increasing — to 3.1% of the population in 2011.\n\nThe bulk of the eastern outskirts are relatively compact and much of the remainder of the county by the 21st century has become transformed economically into a retirement and commuter belt for the city and its railway links. The division's south-west quarter is within normal walking distance of all parts of Leicester City Centre and the seat is served by buses and cycle routes into the city centre.\n\nThe seat was created in 1918 and for the next four years was served by Sir Gordon Hewart KC, resigning to become Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. In 1950 the area was divided between Leicester North East and Leicester South East, which also covered part of the present Charnwood seat and Rutland and Melton.\n\nIn 1974 the seat was recreated.\n\nLeicester East has been won by the Labour Party's candidate in 10 of 11 elections since its recreation. Its MP, Keith Vaz, has won an absolute majority (plurality) of votes since the 1992 general election. The 2015 result made the seat the 37-safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority. Leicester East was narrowly won by Conservative candidate Bruinvels at the height of the Tory party's popularity in 1983; the following election saw Labour's Keith Vaz regain the seat; he has held it at every election thereafter, and since 1992 has always won by margins of over 20% and 11,000 votes. Vaz won his highest majority ever, 22,428 votes (42.8%), in 2017.\n\nThe candidate fielded by the Conservative Party has been runner-up in every election save for Bruinvels' win in 1983. The candidate of UKIP for the first time took third place in 2015, her 2010 counterpart having won 1.5% of the vote and the party not having stood before. The pro-UKIP swing between 2010 and 2015 elections, of 7.4%, was less than the national average of 9.5%. Cooper fell 1.8% short of second place in 2005, giving the best result of a Liberal Democrat to date, attracting just under one fifth of the vote.\n\nTurnout in the recreated seat has ranged between 78.7% in 1992 to 62.1% in 2001.\n\nIn 2005 this seat bucked the national trend as there was a swing to Labour whereas the national swing was 2.5% to the Conservatives.\n\n"}

The largest towns in the constituency are Long Eaton and Ilkeston. An area which is neither especially wealthy nor especially poor, Erewash is described by political commentators as a \"key marginal seat\" in general elections.\n\n \n\n\n"}

Until 1997, it only elected candidates from the Conservative Party. The seat was represented by the former Carlton MP Sir Philip Holland until 1987, then for ten years by Andrew Mitchell, son of former Conservative MP David Mitchell.

At that election, the junior minister lost to Labour's Vernon Coaker who retained the seat until the 2019 elections.\n\nThe 2010 and 2015 results set the seat as marginal: first and second place were separated by less than 7%. At the 2005 general election, the Conservative candidate Anna Soubry (who was elected MP for nearby Broxtowe in 2010) caused controversy by revealing that she \"was not proud\" of the record of the area she was vying to represent, referring to crime levels in Nottingham — the subsequent swing from Labour to Conservative was only 2.1% compared with the national swing of 3.1%.

{"id": "1822106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822106", "title": "Eileen Myles", "text": "Eileen Myles\n\nEileen Myles (born December 9, 1949) is an American poet and writer who has produced more than twenty volumes of poetry, fiction, nonfiction, libretti, plays, and performance pieces over the last three decades. Novelist Dennis Cooper has described Myles as \"one of the savviest and most restless intellects in contemporary literature.\" In 2012, Myles received a Guggenheim Fellowship to complete \"Afterglow\" (a memoir), which gives both a real and fantastic account of a dog's life.\n\nEileen Myles was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on December 9, 1949, to a family with a working-class background. They attended Catholic schools in Arlington, Massachusetts, and graduated from UMass Boston in 1971.\n\nMyles moved to New York City in 1974 with the intention of becoming a poet. In New York they participated in writing workshops held at St. Mark's Poetry Project, which promoted the idea of the \"working artist,\" a pragmatic notion that Myles found appealing given their background; there they studied with Alice Notley, Ted Berrigan, Paul Violi, and Bill Zavatsky, and was given a template for creating art in the context of community. There, Myles first met the poet Allen Ginsberg, whom they admired and who became the subject of several of their poems and essays. In 1979 they worked as an assistant to the poet James Schuyler.\n\nIn 1984 Myles was hired as the artistic director of St. Mark's Poetry Project, which, they have stated, gave them the opportunity to rethink the institution that influenced their early work. During Reagan's presidency, 1981–1988, Myles dealt with the cuts to the NEA art budget and focused their energies on broadening the aesthetic and cultural range of the St. Mark's Poetry Project. Myles' leadership of the Project represented a generational shift away from the church's base, which until then been run by the second generation members of the New York School. Program Coordinators in this period were Patricia Spears Jones, and Jessica Hagedorn, and Myles invited Alice Notley and Dennis Cooper to teach. Charles Bernstein ran the lecture series, Chris Kraus, Marc Nasdor, and Richard Elovich coordinated performance, Tim Dlugos and James Ruggia edited the Newsletter. During Myles tenure at St. Mark's, Myles performed \"An American Poem\" for the first time at P.S. 122.\n\nIn 1991–1992 Myles conducted an \"openly female\" write-in campaign for the office of President of the United States from the East Village that spiraled into a project of national interest. Part performance art, part protest, this gesture was meant to offer an alternative glimpse into what progressive, radical, and socially committed politics could look like.\n\nZoe Leonard's 1992 poem, \"I want a president\", which begins with the line: \"I want a dyke for president\", was written to celebrate Myles's presidential run.\n\nBeginning in 2002, Myles began serving as a Professor of Writing at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD); they directed the writing program for five years before they left. UCSD funded the research and travel grant that enabled the creation of \"Inferno\" (2010), as well as \"Hell\", an opera composed by Michael Webster, for which Myles wrote the libretto. Since leaving UCSD in 2007, Myles has been a Visiting Writer at Bard College, Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University, Washington University, University of Montana-Missoula, Columbia's School of the Arts, and New York University.\n\nIn 2016, Myles endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in a BuzzFeed piece entitled \"Hillary Clinton: The Leader You Want When The World Ends\". Myles was also approached by Clinton's campaign to write a poem, as part of \"Artists for Hillary\", a mostly-female group which included Jenny Holzer and Maya Lin, whose creative statements were testament to their support for Clinton's presidential bid. Myles's poem was entitled MOMENTUM 2016.\n\nBy their own account, Myles moved from Boston to New York in 1974 \"to be a poet,\" where they became associated with a group of poets at St. Mark's Poetry Project. Myles's first book, \"The Irony of the Leash\", was published by Jim Brodey from the St. Mark's Poetry Project in 1978.\n\nIn 1977 and 1979, Myles published issues of \"dodgems\", a literary magazine, a title referring, in the vernacular of Great Britain, to bumper cars, specifically those of Revere Beach, MA. The title is said to serve as a metonym for the collision of aesthetic differences that characterized the poetry scene of that time. The \"dodgems\" issues featured poems by John Ashbery, Barbara Guest, Charles Bernstein, as well as a letter from Lily Tomlin and an angry note from a neighbor; both issues are referenced in the book, \"A Secret Location on the Lower East Side—Adventures in Writing: 1960–1980\", (which also describes St. Mark's), and were exhibited in vitrines in the Library's 1998 show on the same subject.\n\nMyles's next collection, \"A Fresh Young Voice From the Plains\" (1981), earned their first major review, by Jane Bosveld in Ms.. \"Not Me\" (1991) is Myles's most popular collection of poetry. It contains Myles work, \"An American Poem,\" in which they fictionalize their identity and claims to be a \"Kennedy\", and comfortably addresses politics in the work. They first performed the work at P.S. 122 in New York City, during their tenure at St. Mark's. Since then \"An American Poem\" has been filmed and shown in film festivals all over the world, screening in New York and other major cities. It has been included, in translation, in German, Russian, and Italian anthologies of American writing. The trajectory of \"An American Poem\" is documented in Myles's novel \"Inferno\" (2010).\n\nMyles produced \"Maxfield Parrish/early and new poems\" (1995), a collection of both new and selected poems on the theme of the surreality of sex. In the same year, Myles co-edited \"The New Fuck You: Adventures in Lesbian Reading\" (1995) with Liz Kotz, which is described as having a multi-genre approach and postmodern focus on reading rather than identity, and which is said to have offered something different from mainstream gay and lesbian poetry anthologies of the 1990s. Soon after, \"School of Fish\" (1997) appeared, the first work wherein Myles's dog, Rosie is featured, where Rosie served as a second camera in the poem's field of vision.\n\nMyles published \"Skies\" (2000), a project begun in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where the poet described the sky becoming \"a new character in my life.\" The book is framed by a transcript of a panel at The Schoolhouse Gallery in Provincetown, Massachusetts featuring Helen Miranda Wilson, Frances Richard, John Kelly, Molly Benjamin, and Jack Pierson, who each spoke about their own relation to the sky. \"On My Way\" (2001) concludes with an essay about speech and class, \"The End of New England.\"\n\n\"Snowflake / Different Streets\" (2012) uses the technique of dos-à-dos binding to combine two distinct collections of poetry in the same physical book. As Ian Bodkin writes in his review of the work, Myles' poems \"navigat[e] the ever-insular landscape of our technological culture that invades moments of quiet thought\" in \"Snowflake\", then \"offers a sense of return to the people and places of intimacy, connections that bring her back to this world\" in \"different streets\".\n\nThough Myles's primary intention was to be a poet, they have stated that they were also moved by the New Journalism of the sixties and seventies and the art writing tradition by poets of the New York School. In the 1980s, Myles began to publish personal journalism, book reviews, and art reviews. Early columns appeared in the \"Poetry Project Newsletter\"; their essay \"I Hate Mimeo\" called for an end to the same publishing format in which their essay appeared. In the 1990s they wrote a monthly column in Paper Magazine.\n\nMyles' early book and theater reviews appeared in New York Native, Outweek, and Out, and they were a notable figure on the poetry and queer art scene of the 1980s and 1990s on the Lower East Side. Later, Myles would publish essays and other article in the Village Voice, The Nation, Artforum, Parkett, and Art in America.\n\nIn 2006 Myles received an Warhol/Creative Capital grant, which funded their first collection of nonfiction, \"The Importance of Being Iceland: Travel Essays in Art\" (2009). The title essay from this collection, \"Iceland,\" has been described as part travel essay, part personal essay, and part inquiry into the nature of how landscape and writing affect each other.\n\nMyles's first collection of stories, \"Chelsea Girls\" (1994) features \"Bread and Water,\" the oldest story in the collection, and an account of life in the East Village in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Raymond Foye called it \"The quintessential memoir of the Lower East Side.\" In an interview with Michael Hafford, Myles stated that \"Bread and Water\" \"was literally like a copy of my life at that moment.\" In \"Chelsea Girls,\" the title story, Myles chronicles their time as the assistant to poet James Schuyler in the Chelsea Hotel; their intergenerational exchange has been the subject of scholarship by Dianne Chisholm and José Esteban Muñoz.\n\nMyles's second full-length work, \"Cool for You: a nonfiction novel\" (2000) catalogs abject institutional spaces of an \"insider,\" in opposition to the male artist as an \"outsider.\" Among these spaces are school, family, and various bad jobs; the extreme insider of the book is Myles's maternal grandmother Nellie Riordan Myles, who spent the last 17 years of her life in a state mental hospital in Massachusetts. Also included in \"Cool for You\" 's inventory is an imaginary one—a chapter that describes the solar system from the perspective of a ten-year-old version of Myles herself, Myles's first foray into fantasy writing. \"Cool for You\" received widespread recognition and was reviewed in \"The New York Times\" and \"The Nation\".\n\n\"Inferno (a poet's novel)\" (2010) fictionalizes the life of a poet very similar to Myles, and Myles stated in an interview with John Oakes that the vernacular language of Dante's \"The Inferno\" is their \"biggest argument for the way I write.\" It was awarded a 2011 Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Fiction. On September 29, 2015, HarperCollins reissued Myles's out-of-print novel, \"Chelsea Girls\".\n\nIn 1979 Myles founded the Lost Texans Collective with Elinor Nauen and Barbara McKay. That year the group produced \"Joan of Arc a spiritual entertainment\" and would produce \"Patriarchy, a play\" in 1980.\n\nLater solo performances include \"Leaving New York (1989), Life (1991), and Summer in Russia (1996), which were performed at P.S. 122, Judson Church.\n\nMyles's later plays, \"Feeling Blue parts 1, 2, and 3\"; \"Modern Art\"; and \"Our Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz\", written for Alina Troyano were all produced at WOW Cafe and P.S. 122.\n\nSince the early eighties Myles has toured and read their own work extensively.

P. Thompson in \"Time, Work-Discipline, and Industrial Capitalism\", published in 1967. Coming from a Marxist viewpoint, Thompson argued that observance of clock-time is a consequence of the European industrial revolution, and that neither industrial capitalism nor the creation of the modern state would have been possible without the imposition of synchronic forms of time and work discipline. The new clock time imposed by government and capitalist interests replaced earlier, collective perceptions of time that Thompson believed flowed from the collective wisdom of human societies. While in fact it appears likely that earlier views of time were imposed instead by religious and other social authorities prior to the industrial revolution, Thompson's work identified time discipline as an important concept for study within the social sciences. \n\nWhile Thompson's theory of industrial time-discipline has dominated the field for more than 40 years, critics of his work have emerged. \n\nPaul Glennie and Nigel Thrift posit an alternative perspective on the development of time-consciousness in \"Reworking E. P. Thompson's 'Time, Work-Discipline and Industrial Capitalism'\" (1996). According to Glennie and Thrift, Thompson and subsequent theorists on modern time competence in England have theorized that industrial work-discipline centered on the clock is responsible for spreading a unitary concept of time rooted in materialist realities. In contrast, Glennie and Thrift explore the role of symbolic, qualitative, and multiple time-senses in the West. Different kinds of work and multiple means of measuring time problematize the centrality of factory work and the clock. Generally, they argue that time-discipline was evident before the spread of industrialization and that it did not trigger a significant change in time-sense. Because it rests on the argument that disparate, spatial temporalities can not be unified, critics have argued that their analysis seems incomplete. In short, they offer poignant critiques of the dominant theory without positing a stronger theory in its place.\n\nMichael J. Sauter argues that Thompson's approach to time discipline is \"gendered and Eurocentric\". Time discipline did not arise because of the Industrial Revolution, but had been a phenomenon since the Middle Ages as the government, religion, and economics played larger roles in day-to-day life. In Sauter's article \"Clockwaters and Stargazers: Time Discipline in Early Modern Berlin\", he argues that time discipline came from the streets, and was part of the rise of \"local knowledge\" as public clocks were used by public event planners. People began to learn where clocks were located and which social groups used which ones. Furthermore, Sauter argues that time discipline is not \"externally imposed\" on people, but \"a standard that is determined by people with specialized knowledge and skills\". Prior to the rise of mechanical timekeeping, clocks were based on the easily accessed sun, and after 1800 precise timekeeping again returned to the Earth's position in relationship to the stars, as measured by scientists using specialized instruments.\n\nIn societies based around agriculture, hunting, and other pursuits that involve human interaction with the natural world, time discipline is a matter governed by astronomical and biological factors. Specific times of day or seasons of the year are defined by reference to these factors, and measured, to the extent that they need measuring, by observation. Different peoples' needs with respect to these things mean sharply differing cultural perceptions of time. For example, it surprises many non-Muslims that the Islamic calendar is entirely lunar and makes no reference at all to the seasons; the desert-dwelling Arabs who devised it were nomads rather than agriculturalists, and a calendar that made no reference to the seasons was no inconvenience for most of them.\n\nIn more urban societies, some of these natural phenomena were no longer at hand, and most were of much less consequence to the inhabitants. Artificial means of dividing and measuring time were needed. Plautus complained of the social effect of the invention of such divisions in his lines complaining of the sundial:\n\nPlautus's protagonist here complains about the social discipline and expectations that arose when these measurements of time were introduced. The invention of artificial units of time measurement made the introduction of time management possible, and time management was not universally appreciated by those whose time was managed.\n\nIn western Europe, the practice of Christian monasticism introduced new factors into the time discipline observed by members of religious communities. The rule of Saint Benedict introduced canonical hours; these were religious observances that were held on a daily basis, and based on factors again mostly unrelated to natural phenomena. It is no surprise, then, that religious communities were likely the inventors, and certainly the major consumers, of early clocks. The invention of the mechanical clock in western Europe, and its subsequent technical developments, enabled a public time discipline even less related to natural phenomena. (Highly sophisticated clepsydras existed in China, where they were used by astrologers connected with the imperial court; these water clocks were quite large, and their use limited to those who were professionally interested in precise timekeeping.)\n\nThe English word \"clock\" comes from an Old French word for \"bell,\" for the striking feature of early clocks was a greater concern than their dials. Shakespeare's Sonnet XII begins, \"When I do count the clock that tells the time.\" Even after the introduction of the clock face, clocks were costly, and found mostly in the homes of aristocrats. The vast majority of urban dwellers had to rely on clock towers, and outside the sight of their dials or the sound of their bells, clock time held no sway. Clock towers did define the time of day, at least for those who could hear and see them. As the saying goes, \"a person with a clock always knows what time it is; a person with two clocks is never sure.\"\n\nThe discipline imposed by these public clocks still remained lax by contemporary standards. A clock that only strikes the hours can only record the nearest hour that has passed; most early clocks had only hour hands in any case. Minute hands did not come into widespread use until the pendulum enabled a large leap in the accuracy of clocks; for watches, a similar leap in accuracy was not made possible before the invention of the balance spring. Before these improvements, the equation of time, the difference between apparent and mean solar time, was not even noticed.\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, private ownership of clocks and watches became more common, as their improved manufacture made them available for purchase by at least the bourgeoisie of the cities. Their proliferation had many social and even religious consequences for those who could afford and use them.\n\nBefore time became standardized, clock masters used “True Time”. The day work began and ended with the sun. This time period was divided into 12 equal hours. This meant that these hours would vary with the seasons, as the length of daylight changed. Each town would have their own variance of this “True Time”. Eventually, cities adopted “Mean Time”, which is how we think of time nowadays. Astronomers used the Earth's rotation and the stars to calculate the time, and divided the day into 24 uniform and equal hours. Geneva was the first city to adopt mean time in 1780, followed by London in 1792, Berlin in 1810, Paris in 1816, and Vienna in 1823.\n\nReligious texts of the period make many more references to the irreversible passage of time, and artistic themes appeared at this time such as \"Vanitas\", a reminder of death in the form of a still life, which always included a watch, clock, or some other timepiece. The relentless ticking of a clock or watch, and the slow but certain movement of its hands, functioned as a visible and audible \"memento mori\". Clocks and sundials would be decorated with mottos such as \"ultima forsan\" (\"perhaps the last\" [hour]) or \"vulnerant omnes, ultima necat\" (\"they all wound, and the last kills\"). Even today, clocks often carry the motto \"tempus fugit\", \"time flies.\" Mary, Queen of Scots was said to have owned a large watch made in the shape of a silver skull.\n\nEconomically, their impact was even greater; an awareness that \"time is money\", a limited commodity not to be wasted, also appears during this period. Because Protestantism was at this time chiefly a religion of literate city dwellers, the so-called \"Protestant work ethic\" came to be associated with this newly fashioned time discipline. Production of clocks and watches during this period shifted from Italy and Bavaria to Protestant areas such as Geneva, the Netherlands, and England; the names of French clockmakers during this time disclose a large number of commonly Huguenot names from the Old Testament.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the introduction of standard time and time zones divorced the \"time of day\" from local mean solar time and any links to astronomy. Time signals, like the bells and dials of public clocks, once were relatively local affairs; the ball that is dropped in Times Square on New Year's Eve in New York City once served as a time signal whose original purpose was for navigators to check their marine chronometers. However, when the railroads began running trains on complex schedules, keeping a schedule that could be followed over distances of hundreds of miles required synchronization on a scale not attempted before. Telegraphy and later shortwave radio were used to broadcast time signals from the most accurate clocks available. Radio and television broadcasting schedules created a further impetus to regiment everyone's clock so that they all told the same time within a very small tolerance; the broadcasting of time announcements over radio and television enabled all the households in their audience to get in synch with the clocks at the network.\n\nThe mass production of clocks and watches further tightened time discipline in the Western world; before these machines were made, and made to be more accurate, it would be pointless to complain about someone's being fifteen, or five, minutes late. For many employees, the time clock was the clock that told the time that mattered: it was the clock that recorded their hours of work. By the time that time clocks became commonplace, public, synchronized clock time was considered a fact of life. Uniform, synchronized, public clock time did not exist until the nineteenth century.\n\nWhen one speaks about the intellectual history of time, one essentially is stating that changes have occurred in the way humans experience and measure time. Our conceived abstract notions of time have presumably developed in accordance with our art, our science, and our social infrastructure. (See also horology.)\n\nThe units of time first developed by humans would likely have been days and months (moons). In some parts of the world the cycle of seasons is apparent enough to lead to people speaking about years and seasons (e.g. 4 summers ago, or 4 floods ago). With the invention of agriculture in the 3rd millennium BC, people relied heavily on the cycle of the seasons for planting and harvesting crops. Most humans came to live in settled societies and the whole community relied upon accurate predictions of the seasonal cycle. This led to the development of calendars. Over time, some people came to recognize patterns of the stars with the seasons. Learning astronomy became an assigned duty for certain people so they could coordinate the lunar and solar calendars by adding days or months to the year.\n\nAt about the same time, sundials were developed, likely marked first at noon, sunrise and sunset. In ancient Sumer and Egypt, numbers were soon used to divide the day into 12 hours; the night was similarly divided. In Egypt there is not as much seasonal variation in the length of the day, but those further from the equator would need to make many more modifications in calibrating their sundials to deal with these differences. Ancient traditions did \"not\" begin the day at midnight, some starting at dawn instead, others at dusk (both being more obvious).\n\nSince a sundial has only one \"hand,\" a minute probably only meant \"a short time.\" It took centuries for technology to make measurements precise enough for minutes (and later seconds) to become fixed meaningful units—longer still for milliseconds, nanoseconds, and further subdivisions.\n\nWhen the water clock was invented, time could also be measured at night—though there was significant variation in flow rate and less accuracy and precision. With water clocks, and also candle clocks, modifications were made to have them make sounds on a regular basis.\n\nWith the invention of the hourglass (perhaps as early as the 11th century), hours and units of time smaller than an hour could be measured much more reliably than with water clocks and candle clocks.\n\nThe earliest reasonably accurate mechanical clocks are the 13th century tower clocks probably developed for (and perhaps by) monks in Northern Italy. Using gears and gradually falling weights, these were adjusted to conform with canonical hours—which varied with the length of the day. As these were used primarily to ring bells for prayer, the clock dial likely only came later. When dials were eventually incorporated into clocks, they were analogous to the dials on sundials, and, like a sundial, the clocks themselves had only one hand.\n\nA possible explanation for the shift from having the first hour being the one after dawn, to having the hour after noon being designated as 1 pm (post meridiem), is that these clocks would likely regularly be reset at local high noon each day. This, of course, results in midnight becoming 12 o'clock.\n\nPeter Henlein, a locksmith and burgher of Nuremberg, Germany, invented a spring-powered clock around 1510. It had only one hand, had no glass cover, and was rather imprecise because it slowed down as the spring unwound. In fact, Henlein went so far as to develop the first portable watch; it was six inches high. People usually carried it by hand, or wore it around their necks or in large pockets. The first reported person to actually wear a watch on the wrist was the French mathematician and philosopher, Blaise Pascal (1623–1662). He attached his pocket watch to his wrist with a piece of string.\n\nIn 1577, the minute hand was added by a Swiss clock maker, Jost Burgi (who also is a contender for the invention of logarithms), and was incorporated into a clock Burgi made for astronomer Tycho Brahe, who had a need for more accuracy as he charted the heavens.\n\nWith invention of the pendulum clock in 1656 by Christiaan Huygens, came isochronous time, with a fixed pace of 3600 seconds per hour. By 1680, both a minute hand and then a second hand were added. Some of the first of these had a separate dial for the minute hand (turning counter-clockwise), and a \"second\" hand that took 5 minutes per cycle. Even as late as 1773, towns were content to order clocks without minute hands.\n\nBut the clocks were still aligned with the local noonday sun. Following the invention of the locomotive in 1830, time had to be synchronized across vast distances in order to organize the train schedules. This eventually led to the development of time zones, and, thus, global isochronous time. These time changes were not accepted everywhere right away, because many people's lives were still tied closely to the length of the daytime. With the invention in 1879 of the light bulb, that changed too.\n\nThe isochronous clock changed lives. Appointments are rarely \"within the hour,\" but at quarter hours (and being five minutes late is often considered being tardy). People often eat, drink, sleep, and even go to the bathroom in adherence to some time-dependent schedule.\n\n\n\n"}

As Secretary of State, he played a prominent part in the various movements of his time, but did not gain the confidence of any party. He adhered to the party of James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, illegitimate half-brother of the Queen, against the extreme measures of John Knox.\n\nMaitland proved a highly astute ambassador at Elizabeth I of England's court. He was involved in the conspiracy to murder David Rizzio (the private secretary and rumoured lover of Queen Mary) by her King consort Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley and his supporters, but he managed to regain the Queen's favour. After Mary was captured by her enemies at the battle of Carberry Hill, on 25 July 1567 Maitland came to see the English ambassador in Edinburgh, Nicholas Throckmorton. As instructed by Elizabeth, Throckmorton asked Maitland if the plan was to restore Mary to the throne. If so, Elizabeth promised to help prosecute Darnley's murder and preserve Prince James. Throckmorton recorded Maitland's personal answer, which outlined that English interference was not welcome at this time, and might even be counterproductive, and Throckmorton would not be allowed to see Mary;\"Being in place to knowe more than you can knowe, I saye unto yowe ..., in case you doe on the Quenes majesties behalf your mestris, presse this company to enlarge the Quene my soveraigne, and to suffer you to goe unto her (at Lochleven Castle), or doe use any thretnynge speache in those matters, the rather to compasse them (\"rather than achieve them\"), I assure you, you wyll put the Quene my soveraigne in greate jeopardye of her lyffe: and therefore there is none other waye for the present to do her good but to give place and use mildness.\"\n\nWhen Mary fled to the Kingdom of England in 1568 Maitland joined with the new government, but acted in her interest and formed a party to restore her to power. In 1573 Sir William Kirkaldy of Grange, noted for his military talents and the forthright adherent of Mary, Queen of Scots, held Edinburgh Castle for her party, along with his brother, Sir James, and Sir William Maitland of Lethington.\n\nThe Regent called on the military assistance of Queen Elizabeth I of England, who dispatched Sir William Drury from Berwick-upon-Tweed with a formidable train of artillery to assist in reducing the castle. Kirkaldy resisted with firmness worthy of his high military reputation, until the walls were breached and shattered, his provisions expended, the wells choked with ruins and inaccessible, and the artillery silenced. He surrendered to Sir William Drury on a general promise of favourable terms; but in this, the English commander had undertaken more than he could make good.\n\nBy Elizabeth's orders, Sir William Drury saw himself obliged to surrender his prisoners to the vindictive regent, and the gallant Kirkaldy and his brother were executed at the Market Cross in Edinburgh. Maitland of Lethington, already ill, was removed to Leith prison, where he either died from his disease or, according to some accounts, killed himself.\n\nMaitland married Mary Fleming, one of the \"Four Marys\" who accompanied Mary, Queen of Scots, to France in 1548 as her principal attendants. \"The Great Seal\" (charter number 1519, confirmed at Holyroodhouse on 8 April 1588), gives James Maitland of Lethington (born 1568) as \"son and heir of William Maitland of Lethington, Royal Secretary\".

One of the language designers was Guy L. Steele Jr., whose previous work includes Scheme, Common Lisp, and Java.\n\nThe name \"Fortress\" was intended to connote a secure Fortran, i.e., \"a language for high-performance computation that provides abstraction and type safety on par with modern programming language principles\". Language features included implicit parallelism, Unicode support and concrete syntax similar to mathematical notation. The language was not designed to be similar to Fortran. Syntactically, it most resembles Scala, Standard ML, and Haskell. Fortress was designed from the outset to have multiple syntactic stylesheets. Source code can be rendered as ASCII text, in Unicode, or as a prettied image. This would allow for support of mathematical symbols and other symbols in the rendered output for easier reading. An emacs-based tool called \"fortify\" transforms ASCII-based Fortress source code into LaTeX output.\n\nFortress was also designed to be both highly parallel and have rich functionality contained within libraries, drawing from Java. For example, the codice_1 loop construct was a parallel operation, which would not necessarily iterate in a strictly linear manner, depending on the underlying implementation. However, the codice_1 construct was a library function and could be replaced by another version of the programmer's liking rather than being built into the language.\n\nFortress' designers made its syntax as close as possible to pseudocode and analyzed hundreds of computer science and mathematics papers, courses, books and journals using pseudocode to extract the common usage patterns of the English language and standard mathematical notation when used to represent algorithms in pseudocode. Then they made the compiler trying to maintain a one-to-one correspondence between pseudocode and executable Fortress.\n\nFortress was one of three languages created with funding from the High Productivity Computing Systems project; the others were X10 from IBM and Chapel from Cray, Inc.

The slogan was popularized by controversial psychologist Timothy Leary, although some people have suggested that the idea behind the slogan can be traced back to the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. One of the most influential icons in the counterculture movement which formed in the late 1960s out of opposition to the Vietnam War's escalation, Leary gained influence among much of the youth by advocating the use of LSD – which was criminalized in the United States in 1966 – as a way to escape from the burdens of society. Following the Watergate Scandal, which resulted in the resignation of US President Richard Nixon and the conviction of several officials in the Nixon administration, the slogan became arguably the most accepted form of ideology among baby boomers.\n\nIt is intended to encourage people to avoid fallacious appeals to authority. The term has always symbolized the necessity of paying attention to the rules and regulations promulgated by a government unto its citizenry. However, psychologists have also criticized Leary's method of questioning authority and have argued that it resulted in widespread dysfunctionality. In their book \"Question Authority, Think For Yourself\", psychologists Beverly Potter and Mark Estren alleged that the practice of Leary's philosophy enhances a person's self-interest and greatly weakens the ability to cooperate with others.\n\nHowever, Leary's philosophy was foreseen in concept by C. Wright Mills in his 1956 book, \"The Power Elite\". Quoting: \"Authority \"formally\" resides ‘in the people,’ but the power of initiation is in fact held by small circles of men. That is why the standard strategy of manipulation is to make it appear that the people, or at least a large group of them, ‘really made the decision.’ That is why even when authority is available, men with access to it may still prefer the secret, quieter ways of manipulation.” Mills noted earlier that \"It is in this mixed case—as in the intermediate reality of the American today—that manipulation is a prime way of exercising power.\"\n\n"}

When solutions are calculated numerically, they are often limited to pre-determined quantified grids as in the Cartesian plane which constitute the computational grid, or 'mesh'. Many problems in numerical analysis, however, do not require a uniform precision in the numerical grids used for graph plotting or computational simulation, and would be better suited if specific areas of graphs which needed precision could be refined in quantification only in the regions requiring the added precision. Adaptive mesh refinement provides such a dynamic programming environment for adapting the precision of the numerical computation based on the requirements of a computation problem in specific areas of multi-dimensional graphs which need precision while leaving the other regions of the multi-dimensional graphs at lower levels of precision and resolution.\n\nThis dynamic technique of adapting computation precision to specific requirements has been accredited to Marsha Berger, Joseph Oliger, and Phillip Colella who developed an algorithm for dynamic gridding called \"local adaptive mesh refinement\". The use of AMR has since then proved of broad use and has been used in studying turbulence problems in hydrodynamics as well as in the study of large scale structures in astrophysics as in the Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation.\n\nIn a series of papers, Marsha Berger, Joseph Oliger, and Phillip Colella developed an algorithm for dynamic gridding called \"local adaptive mesh refinement\". The algorithm begins with the entire computational domain covered with a coarsely resolved base-level regular Cartesian grid. As the calculation progresses, individual grid cells are tagged for refinement, using a criterion that can either be user-supplied (for example mass per cell remains constant, hence higher density regions are more highly resolved) or based on Richardson extrapolation.\n\nAll tagged cells are then refined, meaning that a finer grid is overlaid on the coarse one. After refinement, individual grid patches on a single fixed level of refinement are passed off to an integrator which advances those cells in time. Finally, a correction procedure is implemented to correct the transfer along coarse-fine grid interfaces, to ensure that the amount of any conserved quantity leaving one cell exactly balances the amount entering the bordering cell. If at some point the level of refinement in a cell is greater than required, the high resolution grid may be removed and replaced with a coarser grid.\n\nThis allows the user to solve problems that are completely intractable on a uniform grid; for example, astrophysicists have used AMR to model a collapsing giant molecular cloud core down to an effective resolution of 131,072 cells per initial cloud radius, corresponding to a resolution of 10 cells on a uniform grid.\n\nAdvanced mesh refinement has been introduced via functionals. Functionals allow the ability to generate grids and provide mesh adaptation. Some advanced functionals include the Winslow and modified Liao functionals.\n\nWhen calculating a solution to the shallow water equations, the solution (water height) might only be calculated for points every few feet apart—and one would assume that in between those points the height varies smoothly. The limiting factor to the resolution of the solution is thus the grid spacing: there will be no features of the numerical solution on scales smaller than the grid-spacing. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) changes the spacing of grid points, to change how accurately the solution is known in that region. In the shallow water example, the grid might in general be spaced every few feet—but it could be adaptively refined to have grid points every few inches in places where there are large waves.\n\nIf the region in which higher resolution is desired remains localized over the course of the computation, then \"static mesh refinement\" can be used - in which the grid is more finely spaced in some regions than others, but maintains its shape over time.\n\nThe advantages of a dynamic gridding scheme are:\n\n\n"}

The company's mascot is the Jolly Green Giant.\n\nThe Minnesota Valley Canning Company was founded in 1903 in Le Sueur, Minnesota. It used the brand name \"Le Sueur Z\" for canned vegetables starting in 1903; \"Le Sueur\" by itself was first used in 1933.\n\nThe brand \"Green Giant Great Big Tender Peas\" was first used in 1925, and the figure of a giant was introduced three years later by Carly Stanek (Bingum). The brand was created in response to the discovery of a new variety of pea, the Prince of Wales: they were, as Martin Sloan relates, \"oblong, wrinkled, and, as peas go, huge. Despite their size, they were tender, and had a special flavor and sweetness that couldn't be matched. The company went to the brands for which it canned and found that none of them wanted to sell the new peas. So Minnesota Valley decided to sell them under its own label. Rather than apologize for the size of the peas, they decided to emphasize it. They named the peas 'Green Giant.'\" The original mascot had very little in common with the familiar green figure of today: he was a scowling caveman wearing a bearskin rather than foliage designed by John Olson from northwestern MN (this original concept actually owed much to a dark Brothers Grimm fairy tale, \"Der Bärenhäuter\" – \"Bearskin\"). In 1935 a young copywriter, Leo Burnett, revised the face of the brand: \"he traded the bearskin for a leafy suit, gave the Giant a smile...and put the word 'Jolly' in front of the Giant's name.\" The Giant made his first television appearances in 1954, and was later voiced by Elmer Dresslar, Jr. The booming \"Ho, ho, ho\" became the Giant's signature tagline in 1961. Since 1972 he has had a young apprentice, the Little Green Sprout, who represents the consumer.\n\nThe company was renamed to the Green Giant Company in 1950. In 1979 it merged with the Pillsbury Company; in 2001, the group was acquired by General Mills. In 2015, General Mills sold the brand to B&G Foods for $765 million in cash.\n\nIn Canada the brand \"Le Sieur\" has been used since at least 1964, instead of \"Le Sueur\" – presumably to avoid the implications of the French word \"sueur\" (= 'sweat').\n\nIn 1963 a 33 rpm EP, \"When Pea-Pickers Get Together\", featuring Tennessee Ernie Ford and the Green Valley Singers was released. Side one was a medley of popular folk songs, while side two told the story of how Ford and the Jolly Green Giant collaborated on writing his signature TV song (\"How The Green Giant Found His Song (And Almost Lost His Ho! Ho! Ho!)\"). The jacket for the record gives the official \"biography\" of the Jolly Green Giant.\n\nIn 1964 The Kingsmen scored a hit at #4 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 with \"The Jolly Green Giant\", a novelty tune about the Giant's love life.\n\nIn 1999 the marketing industry's leading publication, \"Advertising Age\", posited a list of the twentieth century's top ten advertising icons, and placed the Green Giant third (behind the Marlboro Man and Ronald McDonald, and ahead of Betty Crocker, the Energizer Bunny, the Pillsbury Doughboy, Aunt Jemima, the Michelin Man, Tony the Tiger, and Elsie [the Borden cow]).\n\n\"The Valley of the Jolly Green Giant\" refers to the Minnesota River valley around Le Sueur. Today, just before dropping down into the valley heading south on U.S. Route 169 an enormous wooden sign of the Jolly Green Giant, along with the Little Green Sprout, is visible with the caption \"Welcome to the Valley.\"\n\nThe statue was the idea of Paul Hedberg, the founding owner of local radio station KBEW. During weekdays in the summertime Hedberg would interview people passing through Blue Earth on U.S. Highway 169 for his popular radio program \"Welcome Travellers\". At the end of each interview, Hedberg presented guests with a sample of the peas and corn which had been produced by the town's Green Giant canning plant, along with a sample of what passed for the blue riverbed clay that gave the town its name. A common theme arising in these interviews was a desire to \"see the Green Giant.\"\n\nIn the late 1970s the nation's first transcontinental freeway, Interstate 90, was nearing completion; the final stretch of road to be opened was that portion surrounding Blue Earth. Hedberg was one of many civic leaders instrumental in rerouting the freeway closer to Blue Earth, and saw this as an opportunity to attract new visitors to the town. Keeping in mind how the prospect of seeing the Green Giant fired the imaginations of the children who passed through Blue Earth with their parents each summer, in 1977 Hedberg contacted Thomas H. Wyman, President of Green Giant, to see if the company would allow a statue of their corporate symbol to be erected in Blue Earth to draw the attention of the steady stream of travelers who would be utilizing the new interstate. In his autobiography, \"The Time of My Life\", Hedberg recounts how Wyman was receptive to the idea – on the condition that funds for the project were raised locally, and that the company had to give approval to the final design. After this meeting Hedberg approached several local businesses and asked each to contribute $5,000; within a week the full $50,000 had been secured.\n\nThe four-ton statue was crafted by Creative Display from Sparta, Wisconsin. Work began on the statue in the spring of 1978, with a target for completion to coincide with the opening of Blue Earth's section of Interstate 90 on September 23, 1978. The statue was not delivered fully assembled – the pose Wyman approved had the Giant standing with hands on his hips, but he was then too wide to fit on a flatbed truck so his two arms were transported separately to be attached upon arrival in Blue Earth. As Hedberg remembers in his autobiography, \"I made arrangements with a local crane owner to display the statue temporarily at the site of the I-90 dedication: suspended from this crane, with straps under his armpits, the Giant offered his approving smile for what we’d accomplished with the Highway Administration! It was a spectacular piece of publicity for Blue Earth.\"\n\nThe statue is mounted on a pedestal and has steps so visitors may take a picture standing directly under it. The imposing Green Giant is typically included in lists of America's unusual or notable roadside attractions, and has been featured in numerous magazines, including \"Time\", \"Budget Travel\", and \"Mental Floss\". Blue Earth is at the end of the Minnesota River Valley and still has a canning plant formerly owned by Green Giant that continues to can peas and corn each summer.\n\nBlue Earth's major summer festival is Giant Days, held annually on the weekend following the Fourth of July. In 2014, in honor of the 35th anniversary of the Green Giant statue's installation on its base, Paul Hedberg was asked to serve as Grand Marshal of the parade that culminates the festivities. Every year during Giant Days, green footsteps are painted on sidewalks throughout downtown Blue Earth, leading to local businesses.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1822196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822196", "title": "Molecular neuroscience", "text": "Molecular neuroscience\n\nMolecular neuroscience is a branch of neuroscience that observes concepts in molecular biology applied to the nervous systems of animals. The scope of this subject covers topics such as molecular neuroanatomy, mechanisms of molecular signaling in the nervous system, the effects of genetics and epigenetics on neuronal development, and the molecular basis for neuroplasticity and neurodegenerative diseases. As with molecular biology, molecular neuroscience is a relatively new field that is considerably dynamic.\n\nIn molecular biology, communication between neurons typically occurs by chemical transmission across gaps between the cells called synapses. The transmitted chemicals, known as neurotransmitters, regulate a significant fraction of vital body functions. It is possible to anatomically locate neurotransmitters by labeling techniques. It is possible to chemically identify certain neurotransmitters such as catecholamines by fixing neural tissue sections with formaldehyde. This can give rise to formaldehyde-induced fluorescence when exposed to ultraviolet light. Dopamine, a catecholamine, was identified in the nematode \"C. elegans\" by using this technique.\nImmunocytochemistry, which involves raising antibodies against targeted chemical or biological entities, includes a few other techniques of interest. A targeted neurotransmitter could be specifically tagged by primary and secondary antibodies with radioactive labeling in order to identify the neurotransmitter by autoradiography. The presence of neurotransmitters (though not necessarily the location) can be observed in enzyme-linked immunocytochemistry or enzyme--linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in which substrate-binding in the enzymatic assays can induce precipitates, fluorophores, or chemiluminescence. In the event that neurotransmitters cannot be histochemically identified, an alternative method is to locate them by their neural uptake mechanisms.\n\nExcitable cells in living organisms have voltage-gated ion channels. These can be observed throughout the nervous system in neurons. The first ion channels to be characterized were the sodium and potassium ion channels by A.L. Hodgkin and A.F. Huxley in the 1950s upon studying the giant axon of the squid genus \"Loligo\". Their research demonstrated the selective permeability of cellular membranes, dependent on physiological conditions, and the electrical effects that result from these permeabilities to produce action potentials.\n\nSodium channels were the first voltage-gated ion channels to be isolated in 1984 from the eel \"Electrophorus electricus\" by Shosaku Numa. The pufferfish toxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), a sodium channel blocker, was used to isolate the sodium channel protein by binding it using the column chromatography technique for chemical separation. The amino acid sequence of the protein was analyzed by Edman degradation and then used to construct a cDNA library which could be used to clone the channel protein. Cloning the channel itself allowed for applications such as identifying the same channels in other animals. \nSodium channels are known for working in concert with potassium channels during the development of graded potentials and action potentials. Sodium channels allow an influx of Na ions into a neuron, resulting in a depolarization from the resting membrane potential of a neuron to lead to a graded potential or action potential, depending on the degree of depolarization.\n\nPotassium channels come in a variety of forms, are present in most eukaryotic cells, and typically tend to stabilize the cell membrane at the potassium equilibrium potential. As with sodium ions, graded potentials and action potentials are also dependent on potassium channels. While influx of Na ions into a neuron induce cellular depolarization, efflux of K ions out of a neuron causes a cell to repolarize to resting membrane potential. The activation of potassium ion channels themselves are dependent on the depolarization resulting from Na influx during an action potential. \nAs with sodium channels, the potassium channels have their own toxins that block channel protein action. An example of such a toxin is the large cation, tetraethylammonium (TEA), but it is notable that the toxin does not have the same mechanism of action on all potassium channels, given the variety of channel types across species. The presence of potassium channels was first identified in \"Drosophila melanogaster\" mutant flies that shook uncontrollably upon anesthesia due to problems in cellular repolarization that led to abnormal neuron and muscle electrophysiology. Potassium channels were first identified by manipulating molecular genetics (of the flies) instead of performing channel protein purification because there were no known high-affinity ligands for potassium channels (such as TEA) at the time of discovery.\n\nCalcium channels are important for certain cell-signaling cascades as well as neurotransmitter release at axon terminals. A variety of different types of calcium ion channels are found in excitable cells. As with sodium ion channels, calcium ion channels have been isolated and cloned by chromatographic purification techniques. It is notable, as with the case of neurotransmitter release, that calcium channels can interact with intracellular proteins and plays a strong role in signaling, especially in locations such as the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells.\n\nVarious types of receptors can be used for cell signaling and communication and can include ionotropic receptors and metabotropic receptors. These cell surface receptor types are differentiated by the mechanism and duration of action with ionotropic receptors being associated with fast signal transmission and metabotropic receptors being associated with slow signal transmission. Metabotropic receptors happen to cover a wide variety of cell-surface receptors with notably different signaling cascades.\n\nIonotropic receptors, otherwise known as ligand-gated ion channels, are fast acting receptors that mediate neural and physiological function by ion channel flow with ligand-binding. Nicotinic, GABA, and Glutamate receptors are among some of the cell surface receptors regulated by ligand-gated ion channel flow. GABA is the brain's main inhibitory neurotransmitter and glutamate is the brain's main excitatory neurotransmitter.\n\nGABA and GABA receptors are known to be ionotropic, while the GABA receptor is metabotropic. GABA receptors mediate fast inhibitory responses in the central nervous system (CNS) and are found on neurons, glial cells, and adrenal medulla cells. It is responsible for inducing Cl ion influx into cells, thereby reducing the probability that membrane depolarization will occur upon the arrival of a graded potential or an action potential. GABA receptors can also interact with non-endogenous ligands to influence activity. For example, the compound diazepam (marketed as Valium) is an allosteric agonist which increases the affinity of the receptor for GABA. The increased physiological inhibitory effects resulting from increased GABA binding make diazepam a useful tranquilizer or anticonvulsant (antiepileptic drugs). On the other hand, GABA receptors can also be targeted by decreasing Cl cellular influx with the effect of convulsants like picrotoxin. The antagonistic mechanism of action for this compound is not directly on the GABA receptor, but there are other compounds that are capable of allosteric inactivation, including T-butylbicyclophorothionate (TBPS) and pentylenetetrazole (PZT). \nCompared with GABA, GABA receptors have a higher affinity for GABA, they are likely to be longer-lasting in activity, and their responses are likely to be generated by lower GABA concentrations.\n\nIonotropic glutamate receptors can include NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors. These receptors are named after agonists that facilitate glutamate activity. NMDA receptors are notable for their excitatory mechanisms to affect neuronal plasticity in learning and memory, as well as neuropathologies such as stroke and epilepsy. NDMA receptors have multiple binding sites just like ionotropic GABA receptors and can be influenced by co-agonists such the glycine neurotransmitter or phencyclidine (PCP). The NMDA receptors carry a current by Ca ions and can be blocked by extracellular Mg ions depending on voltage and membrane potential. This Ca influx is increased by excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) produced by NMDA receptors, activating Ca-based signaling cascades (such as neurotransmitter release). AMPA generate shorter and larger excitatory postsynaptic currents than other ionotropic glutamate receptors.\n\nNicotinic receptors bind the acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter to produce non-selective cation channel flow that generates excitatory postsynaptic responses. Receptor activity, which can be influenced by nicotine consumption, produces feelings of euphoria, relaxation, and inevitably addiction in high levels.\n\nMetabotropic receptors, are slow response receptors in postsynaptic cells. Typically these slow responses are characterized by more elaborate intracellular changes in biochemistry. Responses of neurotransmitter uptake by metabotropic receptors can result in the activation of intracellualar enzymes and cascades involving second messengers, as is the case with G protein-linked receptors. Various metabotropic receptors can include certain glutamate receptors, muscarinic ACh receptors, GABA receptors, and receptor tyrosine kinases.\n\nThe G protein-linked signaling cascade can significantly amplify the signal of a particular neurotransmitter to produce hundreds to thousands of second messengers in a cell. The mechanism of action by which G protein-linked receptors cause a signaling cascade is as follows:\n\nNeurotransmitters are released in discrete packets known as quanta from the axon terminal of one neuron to the dendrites of another across a synapse. These quanta have been identified by electron microscopy as synaptic vesicles. Two types of vesicles are small synaptic vessicles (SSVs), which are about 40-60nm in diameter, and large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs), electron-dense vesicles approximately 120-200nm in diameter. The former is derived from endosomes and houses neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, and glycine. The latter is derived from the Golgi apparatus and houses larger neurotransmitters such as catecholamines and other peptide neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are released from an axon terminal and bind to postsynaptic dendrites in the following procession: \n\nNeurotransmitter release is dependent on an external supply of Ca ions which enter axon terminals via voltage-gated calcium channels. Vesicular fusion with the terminal membrane and release of the neurotransmitter is caused by the generation of Ca gradients induced by incoming action potentials. The Ca ions cause the mobilization of newly synthesized vesicles from a reserve pool to undergo this membrane fusion. This mechanism of action was discovered in squid giant axons. Lowering intracellular Ca ions provides a direct inhibitory effect on neurotransmitter release. After release of the neurotransmitter occurs, vesicular membranes are recycled to their origins of production. Calcium ion channels can vary depending on the location of incidence. For example, the channels at an axon terminal differ from the typical calcium channels of a cell body (whether neural or not). Even at axon terminals, calcium ion channel types can vary, as is the case with P-type calcium channels located at the neuromuscular junction.\n\nDifferences in sex determination are controlled by sex chromosomes. Sex hormonal releases have a significant effect on sexual dimorphisms (phenotypic differentiation of sexual characteristics) of the brain. Recent studies seem to suggest that regulating these dimorphisms has implications for understanding normal and abnormal brain function. Sexual dimorphisms may be significantly influenced by sex-based brain gene expression which varies from species to species.\n\nAnimal models such as rodents, \"Drosophila melanogaster\", and \"Caenorhabditis elegans\", have been used to observe the origins and/or extent of sex bias in the brain versus the hormone-producing gonads of an animal. With the rodents, studies on genetic manipulation of sex chromosomes resulted in an effect on one sex that was completely opposite of the effect in the other sex. For example, a knockout of a particular gene only resulted in anxiety-like effects in males. With studies on \"D. menlanogaster\" it was found that a large brain sex bias of expression occurred even after the gonads were removed, suggesting that sex bias could be independent of hormonal control in certain aspects.\n\nObserving sex-biased genes has the potential for clinical significance in observing brain physiology and the potential for related (whether directly or indirectly) neurological disorders. Examples of \ndiseases with sex biases in development include Huntington's disease, cerebral ischemia, and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nMany brain functions can be influenced at the cellular and molecular level by variations and changes in gene expression, without altering the sequence of DNA in an organism. This is otherwise known as epigenetic regulation. Examples of epigenetic mechanisms include histone modifications and DNA methylation. Such changes have been found to be strongly influential in the incidence of brain disease, mental illness, and addiction. Epigenetic control has been shown to be involved in high levels of plasticity in early development, thereby defining its importance in the critical period of an organism. Examples of how epigenetic changes can affect the human brain are as follows:\n\nExcitotoxicity is phenomenon in which glutamate receptors are inappropriately activated. It can be caused by prolonged excitatory synaptic transmission in which high levels of glutamate neurotransmitter cause excessive activation in a postsynaptic neuron that can result in the death of the postsynaptic neuron. Following brain injury (such as from ischemia), it has been found that excitotoxicity is a significant cause of neuronal damage. This can be understandable in the case where sudden perfusion of blood after reduced blood flow to the brain can result in excessive synaptic activity caused by the presence of increased glutamate and aspartate during the period of ischemia.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease and is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. The disorder is characterized by progressive loss of memory and various cognitive functions. It is hypothesized that the deposition of amyloid-β peptide (40-42 amino acid residues) in the brain is integral in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease. Accumulation is purported to block hippocampal long-term potentiation. It is also possible that a receptor for amyloid-β oligomers could be a prion protein.\n\nParkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. It is a hypokinetic movement basal ganglia disease caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the human brain. The inhibitory outflow of the basal ganglia is thus not decreased, and so upper motor neurons, mediated by the thalamus, are not activated in a timely manner. Specific symptoms include rigidity, postural problems, slow movements, and tremors. Blocking GABA receptor input from medium spiny neurons to reticulata cells, causes inhibition of upper motor neurons similar to the inhibition that occurs in Parkinson's disease.\n\nHuntington's disease is a hyperkinetic movement basal ganglia disease caused by lack of normal inhibitory inputs from medium spiny neurons of the basal ganglia. This poses the opposite effects of those associated with Parkinson's disease, including inappropriate activation of upper motor neurons. As with the GABAergic mechanisms observed in relation to Parkinson's disease, a GABA agonist injected into the substantia nigra pars reticulata decreases inhibition of upper motor neurons, resulting in ballistic involuntary motor movements, similar to symptoms of Huntington's disease.\n"}

It tells the story of Fergal O'Hanlon, an IRA Volunteer from Ballybay, County Monaghan who was killed at the age of 20 in an attack on Brookeborough Royal Ulster Constabulary barracks in County Fermanagh on 1 January 1957. The operation was devised and led by Sean Garland, an IRA man from Dublin. Another volunteer, Seán South from Limerick, was also killed during the raid.\n\nBehan later became close friends with Sean Garland, officiating as the best man at Garland's wedding. Behan had been involved with the IRA before writing the song but he did not support the continuing violent campaign of the IRA at the time, and altered the first verse from his initial lyrics to distance himself from nationalism.\n\nThe song is one of the best known to emerge from the Irish nationalist struggle and has been popular amongst the IRA, although it has also been covered by artists from different traditions such as Harvey Andrews, and Christy Moore said that British soldiers often requested the song at his gigs. \"The Patriot Game\" has been recorded by numerous artists, including the Kingston Trio, The Bluebells, The Dubliners, The Wolfe Tones, Schooner Fare, and The Clancy Brothers. It also appears on the Judy Collins LP record \"Whales and Nightingales\".\n\nThere are variations on the lyrics, some of which date from Behan's different versions. For example, the last line can be sung as either \"... cowards who sold out the patriot game\" or \"... Quislings who sold out the patriot game\". The version by the Bluebells altered many of the lyrics to criticise \"the old men who pay for the patriot game\", implying that young volunteers are manipulated into dying for a cause that they believe to be just.\n\nThe Clancy Brothers chose not to sing the verses which sanctioned the murders of Irish police officers or which criticised Éamon de Valera, a choice which Behan took exception to:\nThis Ireland of mine has for long been half free,<br>\nSix counties are under John Bull's tyranny.<br>\nAnd still de Valera is greatly to blame<br>\nFor shirking his part in the patriot game.<br>\n\nI don't mind a bit if I shoot down police<br>\nThey are lackeys for war never guardians of peace<br>\nAnd yet at deserters I'm never let aim<br>\nThe rebels who sold out the patriot game<br>\nWhen Liam Clancy sang the song with the Clancy Brothers, he did include the John Bull verse, but rewrote the second half of it as \"So I gave up my boyhood to drill and to train, to play my own part in the patriot game\". A handful of other artists have since then used those new lyrics in their covers. Most musicians who sang the verse as written by Behan still adjusted the lyric about de Valera and sang it in a more general manner as \"the leaders\". The verse about police officers is very commonly omitted, even by nationalist bands such as the Irish Brigade and the Wolfe Tones, although Harvey Andrews included it unaltered.\n\nLike Behan, Bob Dylan used the melody of \"The Merry Month of May\" for his own song \"With God on Our Side\". Behan criticised Dylan publicly by claiming the melody as an original composition. He was annoyed because the first two verses of Dylan's song were a parody of his own song. Behan took the view that the provenance of Dylan's entire body of work must be questioned. Mike Evans writes that \"legend has it\" that, during an early tour of the UK by Bob Dylan, Behan rang him at his hotel room with an uncompromising tirade. When Bob Dylan suggested that \"My lawyers can speak with your lawyers\", Behan replied, \"I've got two lawyers, and they're on the end of my wrists.\"\n\nAmerican filmmaker Arthur MacCaig named his 1979 documentary after the song, a portrayal of Irish history from a Republican perspective. The title was also used as the title of a 1986 book \"The Patriot Game\" by Canadian author Peter Brimelow. The book evokes the same cynicism about nationalism, but in a Canadian context. Tom Clancy's 1987 novel \"Patriot Games\" and the 1992 film based on the novel are named for the song. The song features heavily in Martin McDonagh's play \"The Lieutenant of Inishmore\", where it is used to comment on the character's misunderstanding of IRA splinter groups.\n\nBritish band Dire Straits' chart hit Brothers in Arms refers strongly to Behan's song both musically (phrasing and ballad structure) and in subject, and Damien Dempsey's \"Colony\" also references the title.\n\n\n"}

His mother was the 3rd daughter of William Browne (1762-1833) of Galway, Calcutta and Sydney. His father, born in New York of Scottish paternity and schooled in Scotland, had made his fortune as a merchant in Calcutta, India, before setting up home in Palmira Square, Brighton. William Ralston Shedden-Ralston spent most of his early years there. Together with three or four other boys he studied under the Rev. John Hogg of Brixham, Devonshire, until he went to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1846, where he studied law and graduated with a BA in 1850.\n\nIn 1852 William's father entered into a lengthy but unsuccessful litigation over his claim to the Ralston estates in Ayrshire, Scotland. The cost dissipated his fortune. The family pressed the claim for many years. William's sister, Annabella Jean Ralston Sheddon (1823-1873), took up the pleadings, and at one stage in 1861 conducted the case before a committee of the House of Lords for more than thirty days while their father was in prison for unpaid legal debts. William had prepared for and been called to the bar before his father's litigation began, but the change in the family's fortunes after the initial unfavourable decision in 1852, forced him to seek a more secure living. He also adopted the additional surname of Shedden.\n\nOn 1 September 1853 William went to work as a junior assistant in the printed-book department of the British Museum, where his zeal and ability won the respect of his superiors. The work began with the requisite two years copying titles for the printed books catalogue, and thereafter he rose slowly through the ranks. When he saw a need for someone who could catalogue Russian books, he began studying Russian, and even learned pages of the dictionary by heart.\n\nWilliam also studied Russian literature. He translated 93 of Ivan Andreevich Krylov's two hundred fables, and this work, published in 1868 as \"Krilof and his Fables\", ran to numerous editions. The following year he brought out a translation of Ivan Turgenev's \"Nest of Gentlefolk\" as \"Liza\"; in 1872, his 439-page \"Songs of the Russian People as Illustrative of Slavonic Mythology and Russian Social Life\", and in 1873 a bloodthirsty collection of \"Russian Folk Tales\". Arthur Ransome read his book of \"Russian Folk Tales\" in 1913 and saw what rich material there was in Russian folklore, but thought Ralston's \"literary prose\" unsuitable; so retold some Russian tales in simple language for children in Old Peter's Russian Tales.\n\nHe made two or three journeys to Russia, formed numerous literary acquaintances there, and had a lasting friendship with Turgenev. He also became a corresponding member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg. He visited Serbia twice, and made numerous visits to Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland.\n\nIn 1874 William published \"Early Russian History,\" the substance of four lectures delivered as the Ilchester Lectures at the Taylor Institution in Oxford. His visits to Russia were mainly to collect material for another, more comprehensive account. Having contracted for its publication with Messrs. Cassell & Co, at the last moment he allowed them to cancel the agreement and publish instead Donald Mackenzie Wallace's book \"Russia\".\n\nHe also possessed a gift for narrating stories orally. He devised a novel form of public entertainment, telling stories to large audiences in lecture-halls, making several successful appearances at St. George's Hall (for the Sunday Lecture Society) and St James's Halls. He gave story-tellings to the young princes and princesses at Marlborough House, and to other social gatherings; and also, in aid of charities, to audiences in east London and the provinces.\n\nHis health failing, he resigned from the British Museum in 1875 and sought to devote himself to literary work, but he was susceptible to acute depression and became increasingly withdrawn. Nevertheless, he wrote for the \"Athenæum\" magazine and the \"Saturday Review,\" as well as the \"Nineteenth Century\" and other magazines.\n\nEarly in 1889 William moved to 11 North Crescent, London, where he was found dead in bed on 6 August the same year. He was buried in Brompton Cemetery. He was unmarried.\n\n\n"}

Widely regarded as one of India's finest academic institutions in social sciences, especially in the discipline of Economics, the Delhi School of Economics is situated in University of Delhi's North Campus in Maurice Nagar, amidst a host of other prestigious academic institutions of the country. Started in the year 1949, the campus of the Delhi School of Economics houses the University of Delhi's Departments of Economics, Sociology, Geography and Commerce, as well as the Ratan Tata Library. Out of these four academic departments, the Departments of Economics, Sociology and Geography come under the Faculty of Social Sciences, while the Department of Commerce comes under the Faculty of Commerce and Business.\n\nShortly after independence, a group of visionaries led by Professor V.K.R.V. Rao and supported by India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, launched a project to create a Centre for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences that would compare with the best in the world. Thus began the Delhi School of Economics in 1949. Currently, the School comprises the Departments of Economics, Geography, Commerce and Sociology. The Department of Economics was designated a Centre of Advanced Study by the University Grants Commission. In 1993, the Centre for Development Economics was created within the department, to strengthen the research infrastructure.\n\nAmong the faculty at the department of economics have been the likes of V.K.R.V. Rao, B.N. Ganguly and K.N. Raj (all three of whom went on to serve as vice-chancellors at the University of Delhi), Amartya Sen (Nobel Laureate), Manmohan Singh (the former Indian Prime Minister and also the key architect of the economic reforms since 1991), Sukhomoy Chakravarty (who was chief economic advisor), Jagdish Bhagwati, Kaushik Basu, Arjun Kumar Sengupta, Partha Sen, Raj Krishna, Syed Mohammad Ali, the economic historian Tapan Raychaudhuri and many others who have excelled professionally.\n\nThe department has been associated with three important journals over the years. It publishes the \"Indian Economic Review\", several faculty members edit the \"Indian Economic and Social History Review\", and for many years it housed the \"Journal of Quantitative Economics\".\n\nThe seminars, conferences and workshops periodically organised by the department have attracted some of the top academics from the world over. These have included Sir John and Lady Ursula Hicks, Edmond Malinvaud, Frank Hahn, Jacques Drèze, Jean Drèze, James Tobin, James Meade, Joan Robinson, Milton Friedman, Michael Kalecki, Nicholas Kaldor, Tibor Scitovsky, Tjalling Koopmans, Lawrence Klein, Agnar Sandmo, Joseph Stiglitz, John Forbes Nash and Eric Maskin.\n\nThe department of sociology was established by the University of Delhi in 1959 as a constituent of the Delhi School of Economics. To begin with, the department trained students for two courses: M.A. and Ph.D. In 1966 a two-year course for the M.Litt. degree was introduced. This has been replaced since 1976 by an M.Phil. degree course of a year’s duration. In 1968, the department was recognised as a Centre of Advanced Study (CAS) in Sociology by the University Grants Commission (UGC). The department receives a renewable five-year grant from the UGC under the CAS scheme. The UGC also provides a renewable three-year grant under its ASHISS (Assistance for Strengthening of the Infrastructure of the Humanities and Social Sciences) program for departmental infrastructure as well as research on State and Society. At present the strength of the faculty includes seven Professors, ten Readers, one Lecturer, and two Research Associates. In addition, there are nine members in the office staff.\n\nThe department has a coordinated programme of teaching and research covering a variety of fields, including some developed for the first time in the country. It grew into international prominence through the works of the notable sociologists and social anthropologists who have taught in the department, which include M N Srinivas, J. P. S. Uberoi, Andre Beteille, and Veena Das among others. Studies have been published or prepared on community power structures, local-level politics, trade unions, co-operatives, textual and contextual studies of Hinduism, religious symbolism, family and kinship, and social and religious movements. Studies have also been conducted in the fields of stratification, gender, environment, the sociology of development, historical sociology, urban sociology, and medical sociology. The sociology of masculinity, demography, popular culture, education, migration, the sociology of violence and documentary practices of the state are some of the new areas that faculty members are working on at present. In 2010, Professor Nandini Sundar from the department, won the Infosys prize in the field of social anthropology.\n\nThe department traces its origin to October 1959, when under the initiative of Professor V.K.R.V. Rao, the then Vice-Chancellor of the University and an eminent Economist, a Department of Human Geography was established as a constituent of the Delhi School of Economics. Professor George Kuriyan, a well-known geographer of India at that time, was the first professor and founder of the department. In 1966, Professor V.L.S. Prakasha Rao took over from him and guided the Department until 1973. During this period, the department acquired a name and a distinctive identity in India and abroad. The department draws students from different parts of India as well as from abroad.\n\nThe department has expanded considerably since 1973. The name of the Department was changed to the Department of Geography in 1976 to indicate the widening scope of teaching and research activity in physical and human aspects of Geography. The department has evolved many new courses, which have been widely acclaimed as the frontiers in Geography. The Faculty members undertake research projects from various agencies including University Grants Commission, Indian Council of Social Science Research, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Indo-Canadian Shastri Institute and Ministries of Govt. of India, which include Indian Space Research Organisation, Department of Science and Technology and Planning Commission.\n\nIn December 1967, the Department of Commerce was set up as a separate department by carving it out of the composite Department of Economics and Commerce, Delhi School of Economics. It became an independent faculty in 1992. Currently, along with the Department of Financial Studies, it constitutes the Faculty of Commerce and Business Studies. The Department is one of the premier centres of learning in the field of business and commerce in the country, and is renowned for its MIB, MHROD, M.Com., M.Phil. and Ph.D. courses.\nThe Department of Commerce started a one-year full-time Post-graduate Diploma in International Marketing (PGDIM) in the year 1985–86. PGDIM remains as a management course in the Department of Commerce. PGDIM is currently coordinated with Sri Guru Gobind Singh College of Commerce, University of Delhi. \nThe department also offers a full-time two-year Master’s programme in International Business (MIB), laying special emphasis on aspects of international business operations including Global Marketing and International Financial Management. The Master of Human Resource and Organisational Development (MHROD) programme was started by the Department in 1995 to impart managerial competencies in the domain of Human Resource Management and Organizational Development.\n\nFrom 2014, the MIB and MHROD courses have been restructured as MBA (IB) and MBA (HRD) respectively.\n\nThe Ratan Tata Library, popularly referred to as RTL, is also situated in the Delhi School of Economics campus. It is one of the best-equipped libraries in Economics and allied fields in Asia Pacific. The total collection comprises 2.5 lakh volumes of books and bound periodicals. Nearly 1300 current titles are being received in the Library. The Library also receives Annual Reports of about 800 Joint Stock companies. It has a special collection on Pakistan to support research in the Area Studies Programme (Pakistan). The Library has been designated as a repository of United Nations publications. It has a fairly large and well-organized collection of State and Central Government publications. The Library has an inter-library loan arrangements with libraries all over the country to meet the research requirements of its research scholars and teachers.\n\n\nDSE also has officially registered the Delhi School of Economics Alumni Association, which has facilitated alumni events in Mumbai and Washington D.C.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bush on November 26, 2002. The Act created a federal \"backstop\" for insurance claims related to acts of terrorism. The Act \"provides for a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism.\" The Act was originally set to expire December 31, 2005, was extended for two years in December 2005, and was extended again on December 26, 2007. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act expired on December 31, 2014.\n\nOn January 7, 2015 the House of Representatives voted 416-5 to approve the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, (, ) extending the TRIA through the year 2020. The Senate approved the extension the day after by a vote of 93-4. On January 12, 2015, President Barack Obama signed the extension into law. TRIA was extended for a third time under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TRIPRA of 2015) and was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2020.\n\nOn December 17, 2019 the House of Representatives voted 297-120 to approve the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (, ) which included the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 extending the TRIA through the year 2027. The Senate approved the extension on December 19, 2019 by a vote of 71-23. The following day, President Donald Trump signed the bill into law. TRIA was extended for a fourth time under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (TRIPRA of 2019) and is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2027.\n\nBefore the September 11 attacks, business insurers generally neither charged for nor specifically excluded terrorism coverage. The scope of the 9/11 attacks and the resulting $40 billion estimated insured loss changed perceptions dramatically. It was the worst terrorist attack on record for both property and fatalities and the worst international attack on American soil since the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, as nearly 3,000 people lost their lives in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.\n\nMuch of the financial cost from the 9/11 attacks fell on reinsurers (that further spread the risk assumed by primary insurers). Unable to accurately model or price terrorism exposures, reinsurers largely withdrew from the market for terrorism coverage. Without reinsurance, primary insurers were then compelled to exclude terrorism. Most state insurance regulators approved terrorism exclusions for use by primary insurers.\n\nMany businesses were not able to purchase insurance protection against future terrorist attacks. This situation was a serious threat to industries where lenders and investors required terrorism protection for their investments. Real estate, transportation, construction, energy, and utility sectors of the economy were vulnerable, creating broader threats to the national economy.\n\nCongress responded by enacting TRIA in November 2002 to provide a government reinsurance backstop in case of large-scale terrorist attacks, requiring that business insurers offer terrorism coverage for the types of insurance included in the act. Congress extended and amended TRIA in December 2005 and December 2007.\n\nFollowing enactment of the 2007 TRIA extension, the Congressional Budget Office forecast a net federal budget cost of $0 for TRIA through 2017. \"Under TRIA, the federal government would help insurers cover losses in the event of a terrorist attack under certain conditions, and would also impose assessments on the insurance industry to recover all or a portion of the federal payments.\" \n\nThe act expired on December 31, 2014, but was renewed at the start of the next congress, with President Barack Obama signing the extension on January 12, 2015. Many experts warn that \"construction projects could be stalled and commercial loans on shopping malls, utilities and skyscrapers could be in jeopardy.\" In addition, according to the Baltimore Sun, the National Football League denied rumors that it would cancel the Super Bowl over the issue.\n\nThe act was set to expire on December 31, 2019, but was renewed under the 116th Congress as part of an omnibus spending bill, with President Donald Trump signing the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 on December 20, 2019. The Act includes the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 which further extends the TRIPRA for an additional 7 years, expiring on December 31, 2027.\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury oversees the Terrorism Insurance Program, with the assistance of the Federal Insurance Office. The Secretary has authority to establish regulations and procedures to implement TRIA.\n\nThe term \"act of terrorism\" is defined in the act as: any act certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of Homeland Security and Attorney General, to be an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure and to have resulted in damage within the U.S. (or outside the U.S. in the case of a U.S.-flagged vessel, aircraft or premises of a U.S. mission). It must be committed as part of an effort to coerce U.S. civilians or to influence either policy or conduct of the U.S. Government through coercion. The definition includes both foreign and domestic terrorists. The Secretary may not delegate this certification authority and his or her decision to either certify or not certify an act of terrorism is not subject to judicial review.\n\nTRIA created a U.S. government reinsurance facility to provide reinsurance coverage to insurance companies following a declared terrorism event. TRIA is a short-term measure designed to help the insurance market recover from 9/11 and develop solutions to insuring terrorism.\n\nTRIA established the Federal Terrorism Insurance Program to administer a system of shared public/private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism in order to protect consumers and create transitional period for private insurance markets to stabilize\n\n\n\n"}

Begun in 1958, the professional company is widely known for the International Fall Festival events it held in the 1980s and 1990s, which garnered international attention and served as the U.S. and world premieres for a number of notable works. One of these performances, the 1990 U.S. premiere of the 1841 work Maria Padilla, was among the primary debuts for noted soprano Renee Fleming. \"I’ve been calling all my singer friends and saying, 'You’ve got to sing for this company.'\" Fleming said at the time. It has \"a lot of vision.\" In 2007, the Toronto Star said \"Opera Omaha has grown into one of the continent's most enterprising regional opera companies.\" \n\nAfter attending the 1992 Fall Festival, Denver Post critic Jeff Bradley wrote that \"this quiet prairie city on the Missouri River is becoming one of the most exciting operatic meccas in the country.\" The Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram in 1992 said Omaha had become \"operatically speaking, one of the most exciting cities in America.\" Similarly, in 1988, the Christian Science Monitor said of Opera Omaha: The company \"demonstrated that 'regional opera' is no longer a pejorative term, that companies such as Opera/Omaha offer a real service to their communities as well as the opera world.\" \n\nThe company's beginnings were decidedly more humble, with its 1958 bill as the Omaha Civic Opera Company composed of four performances: Madama Butterfly, Hansel and Gretel, Oklahoma! and Tosca. Since its founding, singers such as Beverly Sills, Tatiana Troyanos, Samuel Ramey, Frederica von Stade, Catherine Malfitano and Richard Tucker have performed in this company's productions. Sills in 1975 performed the title role in Opera Omaha's production of Lucia di Lammermoor, which was the first production to grace the stage of the then-newly renovated Creighton Orpheum Theater, still the home of the company's main-stage productions.\n\nIn September 1989, the company presented a concert at the Ak-Sar-Ben (arena) by Placido Domingo, drawing 6,231 people, according to a local press account.\n\nThe Omaha Symphony Orchestra is the opera company's resident orchestra. Opera productions are sometimes under the direction of the company's music director, the baton of a guest conductor or the baton of the orchestra's own music director.\n\nOpera Omaha is also home to the Opera Omaha Craftsman's Guild, the nation's only volunteer organized guild that is integral to Opera Omaha's success since 1962. The Craftsman's Guild members donate stagecraft skills in the areas of wardrobe, makeup/wigs, concessions, and parties.\n\nOpera Omaha is known for commissioning a number of modern American works:\n\nEric Hermannson's Soul, based on a short story by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Willa Cather. The work was performed in 1998 under the direction of then-Music Director Hal France. The opera was composed by Libby Larsen with a libretto by Chas Rader-Shieber.\n\nWakonda's Dream in 2003, a work that had its premiere in 2007 and was inspired by events that took place in Nebraska in the late 19th century, including the trial of Ponca Chief Standing Bear. Anthony Davis (composer) composed the opera, with the libretto written by Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Yusef Komunyakaa. Rhoda Levine served as director.\n\nBlizzard Voices in 2008, based on a work by Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Ted Kooser, who also served as the work's librettist. Pulitzer Prize–winning musician Paul Moravec composed the work, which was performed under the direction of then-Opera Omaha Music Director Stewart Robertson.\n\nThe company, along with the New Jersey State Opera, the Rochester Opera and the Celebrity Series of Boston commissioned the 1997 work Many Moons, which is based on the children's book of the same name.\n\nOpera Omaha is internationally known for its productions of world and U.S. premieres of a number of classical and modern works:\n\n1988: The company staged the U.S. premiere of the 1730 George Frideric Handel work, Partenope, under music director John DeMain and stage director Stephen Wadsworth.\n\n1988: The company staged the U.S. premiere of the 1967 Udo Zimmermann piece, Weiße Rose (opera), under music director John DeMain and stage director Stephen Wadsworth.\n\n1990: The company staged the U.S. premiere of the 1924 Nicolae Bretan work, Golem (opera), under stage director and the opera's associate artistic director Keith Warner.

{"id": "1822243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822243", "title": "Fusion gene", "text": "Fusion gene\n\nA fusion gene is a hybrid gene formed from two previously independent genes. It can occur as a result of translocation, interstitial deletion, or chromosomal inversion. Fusion genes have been found to be prevalent in all main types of human neoplasia . The identification of these fusion genes play a prominent role in being a diagnostic and prognostic marker.\n\nThe first fusion gene was described in cancer cells in the early 1980s. The finding was based on the discovery in 1960 by Peter Nowell and David Hungerford in Philadelphia of a small abnormal marker chromosome in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia—the first consistent chromosome abnormality detected in a human malignancy, later designated the Philadelphia chromosome. In 1973, Janet Rowley in Chicago showed that the Philadelphia chromosome had originated through a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, and not through a simple deletion of chromosome 22 as was previously thought. Several investigators in the early 1980s showed that the Philadelphia chromosome translocation led to the formation of a new BCR/ABL1 fusion gene, composed of the 3' part of the ABL1 gene in the breakpoint on chromosome 9 and the 5' part of a gene called BCR in the breakpoint in chromosome 22. In 1985 it was clearly established that the fusion gene on chromosome 22 produced an abnormal chimeric BCR/ABL1 protein with the capacity to induce chronic myeloid leukemia.\n\nIt has been known for 30 years that the corresponding gene fusion plays an important role in tumorgenesis. Fusion genes can contribute to tumor formation because fusion genes can produce much more active abnormal protein than non-fusion genes. Often, fusion genes are oncogenes that cause cancer; these include BCR-ABL, TEL-AML1 (ALL with t(12 ; 21)), AML1-ETO (M2 AML with t(8 ; 21)), and TMPRSS2-ERG with an interstitial deletion on chromosome 21, often occurring in prostate cancer. \nIn the case of TMPRSS2-ERG, by disrupting androgen receptor (AR) signaling and inhibiting AR expression by oncogenic ETS transcription factor, the fusion product regulates the prostate cancer. \nMost fusion genes are found from hematological cancers, sarcomas, and prostate cancer.\nBCAM-AKT2 is a fusion gene that is specific and unique to high-grade serous ovarian cancer.\n\nOncogenic fusion genes may lead to a gene product with a new or different function from the two fusion partners. Alternatively, a proto-oncogene is fused to a strong promoter, and thereby the oncogenic function is set to function by an upregulation caused by the strong promoter of the upstream fusion partner. The latter is common in lymphomas, where oncogenes are juxtaposed to the promoters of the immunoglobulin genes. Oncogenic fusion transcripts may also be caused by trans-splicing or read-through events.\n\nSince chromosomal translocations play such a significant role in neoplasia, a specialized database of chromosomal aberrations and gene fusions in cancer has been created. This database is called Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer.\n\nPresence of certain chromosomal aberrations and their resulting fusion genes is commonly used within cancer diagnostics in order to set a precise diagnosis. Chromosome banding analysis, fluorescence \"in situ\" hybridization (FISH), and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are common methods employed at diagnostic laboratories. These methods all have their distinct shortcomings due to the very complex nature of cancer genomes. Recent developments such as high-throughput sequencing and custom DNA microarrays bear promise of introduction of more efficient methods.\n\nGene fusion plays a key role in the evolution of gene architecture. We can observe its effect if gene fusion occurs in coding sequences. Duplication, sequence divergence, and recombination are the major contributors at work in gene evolution. These events can probably produce new genes from already existing parts. When gene fusion happens in non-coding sequence region, it can lead to the misregulation of the expression of a gene now under the control of the cis-regulatory sequence of another gene. If it happens in coding sequences, gene fusion cause the assembly of a new gene, then it allows the appearance of new functions by adding peptide modules into multi domain protein. The detecting methods to inventory gene fusion events on a large biological scale can provide insights about the multi modular architecture of proteins.\n\nIn recent years, next generation sequencing technology has already become available to screen known and novel gene fusion events on a genome wide scale. However, the precondition for large scale detection is a paired-end sequencing of the cell's transcriptome. The direction of fusion gene detection is mainly towards data analysis and visualization. Some researchers already developed a new tool called Transcriptome Viewer (TViewer) to directly visualize detected gene fusions on the transcript level.\n\nBiologists may also deliberately create fusion genes for research purposes. The fusion of reporter genes to the regulatory elements of genes of interest allows researches to study gene expression. Reporter gene fusions can be used to measure activity levels of gene regulators, identify the regulatory sites of genes (including the signals required), identify various genes that are regulated in response to the same stimulus, and artificially control the expression of desired genes in particular cells. For example, by creating a fusion gene of a protein of interest and green fluorescent protein, the protein of interest may be observed in cells or tissue using fluorescence microscopy. The protein synthesized when a fusion gene is expressed is called a \"fusion protein\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1822245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822245", "title": "William Windham", "text": "William Windham\n\nWilliam Windham ( – 4 June 1810) was a British Whig statesman. Elected to Parliament in 1784, Windham was attached to the remnants of the Rockinghamite faction of Whigs, whose members included his friends Charles James Fox and Edmund Burke. Windham soon became noted for his oratory in the House of Commons.\n\nAn early supporter of the French Revolution, by late 1791 he shared Burke's hostility to it and became a leading anti-Jacobin. After war was declared on France in early 1793, he broke with the antiwar, pro-Revolution Foxite Whigs to form a small 'Third Party' that was independent of Pitt's government but supportive of the war effort. Like Burke, Windham supported the war as an ideological crusade against Jacobinism and was an enthusiastic supporter of the French \"émigrés\" and a Bourbon restoration. In July 1794 he finally joined Pitt's government as Secretary at War but did not control war policy. He discovered that Pitt did not share his enthusiasm for the Bourbon cause and he argued in Cabinet against a peace agreement with the French Republic.\n\nIn February 1801 Windham followed Pitt in resigning from the government over the King's rejection of Catholic Emancipation. He was the leading opponent of the new Prime Minister Henry Addington's peace with France in late 1801 and early 1802. In the Ministry of All the Talents in 1806–7, Windham became Secretary for War and the Colonies, having reconciled with the Foxites. He resigned with them from the government, again over Catholic Emancipation. He spent the rest of his life in opposition, dying in 1810.\n\nWindham was a member of an ancient Norfolk family and a great-great-grandson of Sir John Wyndham. He was the son of William Windham, Sr. of Felbrigg Hall and his second wife, Sarah Lukin. Windham was born at No. 6 Golden Square, Soho, London.\n\nWindham was educated at Eton College from 1757 to 1766 (where he was a contemporary of Charles James Fox). Here he was noted for the ease in which he acquired knowledge, as well for his success in sports. He became known as \"Fighting Windham\" because he was good with his fists. His father died in 1761 and his guardians were Benjamin Stillingfleet, Dr. Dampier, David Garrick and a Mr. Price of Hereford. Windham was removed from Eton for fighting.\n\nWindham attended the University of Glasgow in 1766 and studied under Dr. Anderson, Professor of Natural Philosophy, and Robert Simson the mathematician. Windham wrote three unpublished theses on mathematics. He then attended University College, Oxford from 1767 to 1771 as a gentleman-commoner, where he was tutored by Robert Chambers. According to Edmund Malone, Windham \"was highly distinguished for his application to various studies, for his love of enterprise, for that frank and graceful address, and that honourable deportment, which gave a lustre to his character though every period of his life\". He took his BA degree in 1771, his MA on 7 October 1782, and was awarded a DCL at the Duke of Portland's installation as Chancellor.\n\nWindham was a Christian. Before his balloon ride, he wrote to George James Cholmondeley on 4 May 1785 a letter that was only to be delivered if he did not survive the trip. It contained Windham's confession of faith:\n\nThe best, the greatest, the most solemn office I can render in a letter of this sort, is to extort you to a steady contemplation of divine truths, and a sincere endeavour to confirm in yourself that faith, which after various fluctuations I believe to be the true one, and which, independent of evidence, is supported by too great authorities ever to be rejected with confidence. Whatever may be the diversity of opinion as to the particular nature, I believe Christ to be a person divinely commissioned, and that faith in him affords the fairest hope of propitiating the great author of the world. Cultivate in your mind this persuasion and dwell upon it till it grows into a principle of action. May it avail both to the purposes of final salvation.\n\nIn early 1778 Windham first took part in political matters. He felt strongly about the American War of Independence, writing to Richard Brinsley Sheridan on 5 January that \"I never felt so much disposition to exert myself before\". On 28 January Windham delivered in Norwich his first public speech, where he spoke against the war, and a few days later he wrote a remonstrance against it which was signed by 5,000 people and was presented to the House of Commons. His speech went down well and he was urged to stand for election. Windham stood unsuccessfully for Norwich in the election of September 1780.\n\nWhen in 1783 the Duke of Portland formed an administration, he appointed Lord Northington as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. Northington offered Windham the office of Chief Secretary for Ireland, which he accepted. However, after only four months in the post, Windham resigned under mysterious circumstances.\n\nOn 5 April 1784 Windham was elected to Parliament for Norwich. He took part in the Impeachment of Warren Hastings and his speeches against him on 1 June 1787 and 22 March 1787 were admired.\n\nDuring the Regency Crisis of 1788–89 he spoke in favour of granting George, Prince of Wales full regal powers as Regent. He wrote on 26 November 1788: \"If the King of a country is completely out of his mind, whatever sorrow may be felt for that event, the extent of the evil is, however, known: It is, for the time it lasts, just as if the King were dead. The same person must, upon all principles of reason, and all views of the Constitution, carry on the Government, as if the King were actually dead—should he again be restored completely to his senses, the case is then equally clear: he must be restored completely to his government\".\n\nFrom 12 August 1789 until 6 September, Windham toured France. Upon his return, Windham sent his friend and fellow Whig MP Edmund Burke some books (recommended by a Deputy of the National Assembly) on the general state of public opinion in France in the aftermath of the beginnings of the French Revolution. Windham wrote to Burke on 15 September, saying: \"My notion has been from the beginning, and is not altered by what I have seen or heard, that the new Constitution will be settled without a struggle. Whether perfect quiet and satisfaction may be established in the country is another question: but it does not appear to me, that there is any near prospect of civil commotion.—Any opinion, however, which I can have upon the subject is, of course, very vague conjecture.\"\n\nWhen Henry Flood introduced a motion for parliamentary reform on 4 March 1790, Windham famously said: \"What, would Mr. Flood recommend you to repair your house in this hurricane season?\"\n\nAfter reading Burke's \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" in November 1790, Windham wrote in his diary: \"Never was there, I suppose, a work so valuable in its kind, or that displayed powers of so extraordinary a sort. It is a work that may seem capable of overturning the National Assembly, and turning the stream of opinion throughout Europe. One would think, that the author of such a work, would be called to the government of his country, by the combined voices of every man in it. What shall be said of the state of things when it is remembered that the writer is a man decried, persecuted, and proscribed; not being much valued, even by his own party, and by half the nation considered as little better than an ingenious madman?\"\n\nWindham travelled to Paris in September 1791 and he was present at the ceremony in the National Assembly where King Louis XVI accepted the new constitution of France. Windham wrote to Mrs. Crewe that the ceremony was \"necessarily humiliating...there was somewhat too much of \"la nation,\" and somewhat too little of \"le Roi\".\" Windham wished they had been more courteous and added: \"I hope that we shall be the people to keep up a little of the “vielle cour” in our manners, while we lose nothing of the solid advantages and privileges that the new system can promise\". In May 1792 Windham wrote to a friend on his opposition to parliamentary reform: \"I have in general been far from adverse to the principles an cause of the French Revolution. So much otherwise indeed, that from the beginning almost, Mr. Burke and I have never exchanged a word on the subject. But when an attempt is made to bring the same principles home to us, Principles in a great measure extravagant and false and which at best have no practical application here, I shall ever prove myself as violent an opposer of them as Mr. Burke or any one can be\".\n\nWindham supported the Royalist uprising in La Vendée and he urged the British government to aid them with the aim of restoring the House of Bourbon to the throne: \"I would, from the beginning, have made this the principal object of the war\".\n\nIn a speech to the Commons, on 30 April 1792, he declared that he would unite with any body of men \"who were determined to set their faces against every endeavour to subvert the true principles of the constitution\". On 13 November Windham and Burke met Pitt and hinted they and their fellow conservative Whigs would support strong measures; however, Pitt desired \"more certain and definite assurances of support from the heads of the party before the meeting of parliament\". He still had reservations about completely separating from Fox and he denied in the Commons (on 15 December) that they differed in principles. However, as he said in the Commons on 4 January 1793, he was no longer a systematic opposer of the government.\n\nIn the aftermath of the execution of Louis XVI, Parliament met in February 1793. Fox and his supporters excused France's actions short of supporting the execution and Fox claimed that the British monarchy was elective and that sovereignty resided with the people. On 9 February war was declared on France and the conservative Whigs met the next day. They decided that a reunion with the Foxites was now out of the question and that they would now call themselves the ‘Third Party’. This faction consisted of only approximately 38 MPs (26 of whom were members of the Whig party), with less than one-fifth of the Whigs as members.\n\nIn the opinion of the historian Frank O'Gorman, if the Pitt government was to be persuaded to adopt the only anti-Jacobin policies that would be effective, \"Windham was the only politician who might seriously undertake to accomplish these ends\":\n\nHe was possessed of distinguished talents and a disposition so compelling as to endear him to all. The power of his intelligence was disguised by his self-effacing manner as a reserve of strength and firmness which he did not in reality possess. His talents and his nature, allied to unquestioned integrity, gave him a reputation and a standing among his contemporaries which was, perhaps, second only to that of Fox. It was not by accident that Windham was able to rally to him some of the most respectable independents in the House of Commons. Nevertheless, he was peculiarly ill-suited to the role which he was now called upon to play in...1793. He was daunted with the prospect of assuming responsibility for matters of state by the doubts and fears which gnawed away at the determination he could summon in his rare moments of enthusiasm and exuberance. Once his energy had been overcome by the exhaustion of his spirits, he would fall away into lethargy, despair and pessimism. Having formed the ‘Third Party’, he promptly excused himself from leading it. Having committed its members to a distinct support of administration, he escaped to the solitude of Fellbrig, in spite of 'the possibility of having lost an opportunity of distinction'. He consoled his conscience by toying with the preparation of speeches which he never delivered while he ruminated on his inability to act out the part which he himself had chosen.\n\nOn 17 June Pitt offered Windham the office of Secretary at War. In a speech in the Commons that same day, Windham supported Pitt, arguing that intervention in French affairs might become a necessity if a government was formed in Paris \"as we might with safety treat with\". However, on 19 June he informed Pitt that he would decline his offer, although he added that he might accept office \"sometime hence\". From 12 July until 6 August, he was in Flanders. Windham was the contact between the conservative Whigs and the government; however, he was still at this time hesitant about joining Pitt's government.\n\nIn January 1794 began the trials of the leaders of the British Convention. In response, the radicals proposed another such convention. Therefore, the government decided to arrest leading radicals such as Thomas Hardy. On 13 May, the day after Hardy's arrest, the Commons voted to appoint a Committee of Secrecy to devise the measures necessary to counter a new convention. Windham was appointed to the Committee, along with Burke (and other conservative Whigs and government supporters), much to Fox's chagrin.\n\nThe Duke of Portland, on 3 July, urged Windham that, if he took up Pitt's offer of the Secretaryship at War, he could make it \"a real efficient Cabinet employment\". His friend, Tom Grenville, met Windham that day and he succeeded in persuading Windham to accept office. Portland was therefore able to negotiate with the King a coalition government between the conservative Whigs and Pitt's government.\n\nHe was Secretary at War in Pitt's government. Windham managed to gain a few subsidies for the \"émigrés\" and achieved Cabinet support for the failed Quiberon expedition. In practice, Windham made himself responsible for all matters related to the Royalists but in the spring of 1796 he relinquished his sole responsibility for this as he was frustrated by the need to constantly refer to other departments when ever he wanted to do something that would help the Royalists. He realised that other Cabinet members did not share his enthusiasm for the Royalist cause and for a Bourbon restoration.\n\nIn late 1795 the government decided to negotiate peace with France and Windham agreed that France remaining a republic should be no obstacle to this. However, by October 1796, Windham had changed his mind, writing to Mrs Crewe: \"If I could have been sure that Lord Malmesbury's despicable embassy would succeed and that peace must be the immediate consequence, I should have been out long since\".\n\nIn the dispute between Fitzwilliam and Pitt over Ireland, Windham supported Fitzwilliam and threatened to resign if better policies for governing Ireland were not adopted. Windham acted as the mediator between the two sides.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, Windham supported the union of Ireland with Great Britain, believing that Catholic emancipation would follow. On 7 February 1801 Windham was among those who resigned in protest at the King's veto of Catholic emancipation.\n\nImmediately after the Peace of Amiens was signed, the Prime Minister, Henry Addington, wrote to Windham on 1 October 1801: \"I think when I see you...I can satisfy you that it is not clear even upon your own Principles that we are wrong\". Windham replied to Addington on the same day:\n\nI can have no idea of the measure in question but as the commencement of a career which, by an easy descent, and step by step, but at no very distant period, will conduct the country to a situation where, when it looks at last for its independence, it will find that it is already gone. I have no idea how the effect of this measure is ever to be recover'd; Chance may do much, but, according to any conception I can form, the Country has received its death blow.\n\nWhen the preliminaries of the Treaty were debated in the Commons on 3 November 1801, Windham gave a speech that was, according to A. D. Harvey, the sensation of the evening\". He said Addington and Lord Hawkesbury \"in a moment of rashness and weakness, have fatally put their hands to this treaty, have signed the death-warrant of their country. They have given it a blow, under which it may languish for a few years, but from which I do not conceive how it is possible for it ever to recover\". According to \"The Times\" Windham sat on \"the same bench from which Mr. Burke always spoke after separating from Mr. Fox\" and an observer said he spoke \"like the ghost of Burke\". One contemporary said Windham possessed Burke's insanity without his inspiration. When Charles James Fox visited France during the Peace of Amiens he conversed with Napoleon Bonaparte (on 23 September 1802). Napoleon said he believed Windham's \"talents were mediocre and that he was an unfeeling, unprincipled man\". Fox immediately defended Windham but Napoleon countered: \"It is easy for you who only know public debate. But for me, I detest him and that Pitt who together have attempted my life\". Fox assured Napoleon that \"Mr Pitt and Mr Windham, like every other Englishman, would shrink with horror from the idea of secret assassination\".\n\nWilliam Hazlitt apparently had it on somewhat good authority that Pitt had hated Windham. Windham in turn did not attend Pitt's funeral at Westminster Abbey after his death in January 1806.\n\nOn 5 February 1806 Windham received the seals of office to become Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in Lord Grenville's Ministry of All the Talents.\n\nWindham abolished the ballot for the militia to ensure that only volunteers manned the militia. He also wanted to solve the Army's recruiting shortage by limiting service in the Army to seven years. He increased soldiers' wages from 1 shilling to 1s. 6d. if they re-enlisted after the seven years, and to 2 shillings if they re-enlisted after fourteen years. He also introduced pensions for old soldiers. The Training Act 1806 empowered the government to conscript 200,000 Englishmen a year for twenty four days' military training, although it was not enforced.\n\nWindham opposed the Walcheren Expedition of 1809, believing instead that the forces sent there \"should have been sent to Spain, so as not to leave Buonaparte, when he has settled the Austrian business, to begin, as he did last year, on the banks of the Ebro, but to have driven the whole of the French force out of the peninsula\". Writing to Charles Grey in September 1809, Windham voiced his opposition to peace with France, even though Wellington had been driven from Spain back into Portugal. He further argued that \"the great thing that is wanted is resistance to the strides that are making, in concurrence with the general tendency of things throughout the world, to turn the country into a democracy\".\n\nWindham was opposed to the evangelical movement and their attempt to outlaw traditional English sports: \"Few subjects agitated...Windham...more than the puritanical and Wilberforcian assault on the traditional sports of Englishmen such as boxing and bull-baiting. Windham's speeches in parliament in defense of such practices seem among his most heart-felt\". William Wilberforce wrote to Hannah More—a leading evangelical moralist—on 15 November 1804: \"I really think there scarcely ever were, or can be, two men more different from each other in all their ideas than Windham and myself\". Windham said that Wilberforce would delight in sending aristocrats to the guillotine.\n\nIn the aftermath of the British victory over the French at the Battle of Talavera, Windham wrote on the subject of boxing in a letter to a friend dated 17 August 1809:\n\nWhy are we to boast so much of the \"native\" valour of our troops, as shewn at Talavera, at Vimeira, and at Maida, yet to discourage all the practices and habits which tend to keep alive the same sentiments and feelings? The sentiments that filled the minds of the three thousand spectators who attended the two pugilists, were just the same in kind as those which inspired the higher combatants on the occasions before enumerated. It is the circumstance only in which they are displayed, that makes the difference. ... Bravery is found in all habits, classes, circumstances, and conditions. But have habits and institutions of one sort no tendency to form it, more than of another? Longevity is found in persons of habits the most opposite: but are not certain habits more favourable to it than others? The courage does not arise from mere boxing, from the mere beating or being beat:—but from the sentiments excited by the contemplation and cultivation of such practices. Will it make no difference in the mass of a people, whether their amusements are all of a pacific, pleasurable, and effeminate nature, or whether they are of a sort that calls forth a continued admiration of prowess and hardihood? But when I get on these topicks, I never know how to stop...\n\nOn 8 July 1809, Windham was returning to Pall Mall, London from a friend's when he saw a house on fire in Conduit Street. His friend Frederick North lived a few doors away from the burning house and possessed a valuable library. Therefore, with the aid of two or three men, Windham succeeded in removing most of the books before the fire reached North's house. However, when removing some heavy books, he fell and bruised his hip. After a tumour grew in the hip he received medical help but this was ineffectual. On 6 May 1810 the surgeon Henry Cline advised him that an operation was imperative, an opinion shared by four of the six physicians Windham consulted. Before the operation Windham went to some trouble to receive the Sacrament. Cline performed the operation on 17 May and, although it was successful, Windham did not recover from the shock. His last words were to Dr. Lynn, who moved him into a more comfortable position on the night of 3 June: \"I thank you; this is the last trouble I shall give you. You fight the battle well, but it will not do\". Not long after, he fell asleep and died in the presence of his wife. On 8 June, Windham's body was transported to the family vault at Felbrigg, with a private funeral. In the church window Windham's widow installed a memorial brass with the inscription:\n\nSacred to the Memory of the Right Honourable William Windham, of Felbrigge, in this County. Born the 14th of May, O.S. 1750, Died the 4th of June, N.S. 1810. He was the only son of William Windham, esqre., by Sarah, relict of Robert Lukin, esqre. He married in 1798 Cecilia, third daughter of the late Commodore Forrest; who erects this Monument in grateful and tender remembrance of him. During a period of twenty-six years he distinguished himself in Parliament by his eloquence and talents; and was repeatedly called to the highest offices of the State. His views and councils were directed more to raising the glory than increasing the wealth of his country. He was above all things anxious to preserve untainted the National Character, and even those National Manners which long habit had associated with that character. As a Statesman, he laboured to exalt the courage, to improve the comforts, and ennoble the profession of a Soldier: As an individual, he exhibited a model of those qualities which denote the most accomplished and enlightened mind. Frank, generous, unassuming, intrepid, compassionate, and pious, he was so highly respected, even by those from whom he most differed in opinion, that, tho' much of his life had passed in political contention, he was accompanied to the grave by the sincere and unqualified regret of his Sovereign and his Country.\n\nWindham was greatly influenced by the Whig philosopher Edmund Burke, describing Burke's words as \"the source of all good\". The Foxite Whig, Lord Holland, considered Burke \"the great god of his idolatry\".\n\nSamuel Johnson said of Windham after conversing with him: \"Such conversation I shall not have again till I come back to the regions of literature; and there Windham is, \"inter stellas Luna minores\" [‘the Moon among the lesser fires.’ Horace, \"Odes\" i. xii. 46.]\".\n\nSir James Mackintosh wrote to a friend after meeting Windham in March 1800: \"His conversation is full of sense, knowledge and vivacity and his manners very gentle. We talked with equal enthusiasm of Burke and with equal abhorrence of Democrats and Philosophers\". Upon hearing of Windham's death, Mackintosh said: \"Had Windham possessed discretion in debate, or Sheridan in conduct, they might have ruled their age\".\n\nSir Nathaniel William Wraxall claimed Windham was:\n\n...one of the most accomplished orators and individuals whom we have beheld in our day...His person was graceful, elegant, and distinguished; slender, but not meagre. The lineaments of his countenance, though they displayed the ravages of the smallpox, were pleasing, and retained a character of animation, blended with spirit and intelligence. Over his whole figure, nature had thrown an air of mind. His manners corresponded with his external appearance; and his conversation displayed the treasures of a highly cultivated understanding. Ardent in his love of civil liberty, for the preservation of which blessing, I believe, he would as cheerfully have shed his blood as did Hampden or Sidney; it was constitutional freedom that he venerated, not a republican and impracticable emancipation from limited monarchial government...To Burke, Windham unquestionably bore some analogy; and on \"his\" shoulders may be said to have descended the mantle of Burke...Windham's talents, brilliant and various as they were, always however appeared to me more adapted to speculative, than to practical life.\n\nHenry Brougham said of Windham:\n\n...a lively wit of the most pungent and yet abstruse description, a turn for subtle reasoning ... familiarity with men of letters and artists as well as politicians...a singularly expressive countenance—all fitted this remarkable person to shine ... [but] he was too often the dupe of his own ingenuity; which made him doubt and balance ... His nature ... was to be a follower, if not a worshipper, rather than an original thinker or actor ... Accordingly, first Johnson in private and afterwards Burke on political matters were the deities whom he adored.\n\nThe Whig historian Thomas Macaulay, in his essay on Warren Hastings that he wrote in 1841, praised Windham: \"There, with eyes reverentially fixed on Burke, appeared the finest gentleman of the age, his form developed by every manly exercise, his face beaming with intelligence and spirit, the ingenious, the chivalrous, the high-souled Windham\".\n\nLord Rosebery edited Windham's papers in 1913, and said Windham was:\n\n...the finest English gentleman of his or perhaps of all time. Had he lived in the great days of Elizabeth, he would have been one of the heroes of her reign...He was a statesman, an orator, a mathematician, a scholar, and the most fascinating talker of his day...A noble gentleman in the highest sense of the word, full of light, intellect, and dignity, loved and lamented. His best qualities, no doubt, as is often the case, he carried almost to excess; for his cherished independence he led to a morbid craving for isolation. But to the charge of vacillation in public affairs he was not obnoxious; he was always true to his faith. But he chose his masters well, Johnson and Burke; the one gave him his religious, the other his political creed. In life he was brilliant and successful. In oratory, in parliament, in society, he was almost supreme. But he can scarcely be said to survive. He left no stamp, no school, no work. To those, however, who care to disinter his memory he displays character and qualities of excellence, rare at all times, rarest in these.\n\nF. P. Lock has described Windham as \"a Norfolk squire of uncommon intellectual gifts and great personal charm. His great failing was chronic indecision\". Boyd Hilton said Windham \"was the first in a line of brilliant but maverick right-wing politicians—Lyndhurst, Randolph Churchill, F. E. Smith—who operated too far outside the consensus to be effective. He had a scintillating personality, and political convictions so strong that they belied his otherwise scholarly and discriminating characteristics, but he lacked judgement and had a streak of melancholic instability\".\n\nWindham, a lost early hamlet in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada was named for Windham.\n\n"}

The following year under the redistribution and expansion of Northern Ireland's constituencies his local political base became part of the new Lagan Valley constituency which he has contested in the Alliance interest in all elections since 1983 apart from the 1986 by-election called in protest against the Anglo-Irish Agreement when the local Alliance branch declined to contest the seat as they believed the by-election was a political stunt.\n\nClose also held several positions in the Alliance, including serving as Chair between 1981 and 1982 and as Deputy Leader from 1991 until 2001. He was often a member of the key Alliance delegations in successive talks about the future of the province, culminating in the Belfast Agreement of 1998.\n\nIn the 1996 elections for the Northern Ireland Forum, Close stood at the head of the Alliance's list for Lagan Valley but the party failed to secure enough votes to win one of the local seats.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 28, 1999. In the episode, Homer challenges trucker Red Barclay to a meat eating contest, which Barclay is the long-standing champion of. Barclay wins, but quickly dies of \"beef poisoning\", making it the first time Barclay will miss a shipment. Feeling bad for him, Homer takes on the duty of transporting Barclay's cargo to Atlanta, with his son Bart by his side.\n\n\"Maximum Homerdrive\" was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Swinton O. Scott III. Although the episode's first draft was written by Swartzwelder, the writing staff was split into two groups in order to focus on both the A-story and the B-story. The episode features references to comedian Tony Randall, model Bettie Page, and science fiction film \"\", among other things.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Maximum Homerdrive\" received a 7.8 Nielsen rating among adults between ages 18 and 49, the highest such rating for the series since \"Wild Barts Can't Be Broken\". \"Variety\" credited the boost in ratings to the premiere of \"Futurama\", which aired after \"Maximum Homerdrive\". Following the tenth season's home video release, the episode received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nThe Simpsons go out to dinner at a new steakhouse, whose existence Lisa is protesting. Homer accepts a challenge from truck driver Red Barclay to see who can finish an entire 16-pound steak first. Red wins the challenge, but immediately dies from beef poisoning, as diagnosed by Dr. Hibbert. Homer decides to finish Red's last delivery and brings Bart along with him.\n\nDuring the trip, Homer falls asleep at the wheel due to taking a combination of pep pills and sleeping pills that he bought at a general store. He awakes to discover that the truck has piloted itself safely to a gas station due to an onboard automated driving system. Other truck drivers at the station have the system installed as well and warn Homer not to reveal its existence, as it would put all truckers out of work. However, Homer tells a busload of people about the device and incurs the wrath of a mob of truckers. Although the system ejects itself from Homer's truck, he and Bart manage to escape from the mob and deliver the shipment (artichokes and migrant workers) to Atlanta on time. They then volunteer to drive a trainload of napalm to Springfield so they can get home. The other truckers briefly consider relying on their own skills to drive, but instead decide to come up with a different money-making scheme.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Springfield, Marge decides to have an adventure of her own and takes Lisa on a trip to buy a new doorbell for the house. They choose one that plays a snippet of \"(They Long to Be) Close to You\" and install it, but Marge is dismayed when no one comes to ring it. Lisa loses her patience and rings the bell herself, causing it to malfunction and play the tune over and over. When Marge pulls out one of the wires in an attempt to shut it off, it instead plays faster and louder and disturbs the neighbors. The doorbell store's mascot, Señor Ding-Dong, appears and silences the bell with one crack of his whip; when he tries to leave, though, his car will not start.\n\n\"Maximum Homerdrive\", originally called \"Homer the Trucker\", was written by staff writer John Swartzwelder and directed by \"Simpsons\" director Swinton O. Scott III. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 28, 1999. The meat-eating contest seen in the beginning of the episode was conceived by \"Simpsons\" writer Donick Cary during a story pitch-out, according to writer and executive producer Matt Selman. When rewriting the episode, the writing staff was divided into two groups, so that one group wrote the A-story, while the other wrote the B-story. After the second act, the writers were \"stuck\", as executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully recalled in the DVD commentary for the episode. Eventually, staff writer and co-executive producer George Meyer pitched the idea that the truckers would have \"a secret device, that actually did all the driving for them\", called the Navitron Autodrive System.\n\nIn the season 10 deleted scenes where Homer turns on the radio listening to a song about a trucker who crashed his truck out on I-95, and one more where some of the truckers try to flatten Homer's truck. In order to animate Barclay's truck in \"Maximum Homerdrive\", Scott bought a model truck, which he also based the design of Barclay's truck on. According to storyboard consultant Mike B. Anderson, the trucks in the episode were very difficult to animate, as the \"Simpsons\" animators were still working with traditional cel animation at the time and did not have access to computer tools. In a scene in The Slaughterhouse, an employee is shown killing a number of cows with a captive bolt pistol, however the death of the cows are not shown. Originally, the writers wanted to show the cows being killed, however when Scott saw the scene in the storyboards, the \"Simpsons\" staff instead decided to make the deaths \"indirect\". During the meat eating contest, Homer becomes exhausted and sees two wine glass holding cows, who appear as \"wavy\" figures. In order to achieve the \"wavy\" effect, the \"Simpsons\" animators put a ripple glass on the cels and moved it around while shooting the scene. After the contest, Barclay dies of \"beef poisoning\". The Fox censors were uneasy with including any mention of \"beef poisoning\" in the episode, as talk show host Oprah Winfrey had recently been sued by \"some Texas ranchers\" for defaming the beef industry. In a scene in the episode, Homer buys a jar of \"Stimu-Crank\" pills in order to stay alert while driving during the night. He swallows all the pills at once, to the clerk's dismay. Homer replies, \"No problem, I'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills\", and proceeds to swallow an entire jar's worth of sleeping pills. According to Scully, the censors had \"a lot of trouble\" with the scene, but it was included anyhow.\n\nWhen Homer turns on the truck radio, the song \"Wannabe\" by the Spice Girls can be heard. Originally, a \"trucker song\" about \"a horrible wreck out on old 95\" would be heard. The song was a reference to the \"Wreck of the Old 97\", a famous locomotive that crashed in 1903 and inspired the country ballad of the same name. It was sung by main cast member Dan Castellaneta, included mentions of \"scraping blood and guts off the road\" and was eventually dropped because it was considered too gruesome by the staff. The song was later included as a deleted scene on \"The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD box set. While eating dinner at Joe's Diner, \"12 Bar Blues\" by NRBQ (a band that Mike Scully was fond of) can be heard playing from a jukebox. According to producer Ian Maxtone-Graham, the doorbell tune in the episode \"has a history with \"The Simpsons\"\", as it is also Homer and Marge's wedding song. \"Maximum Homerdrive\" features the first appearance of Señor Ding-Dong, who is a recurring character in the series. He is portrayed by Castellaneta, the voice behind many characters. Red Barclay, the trucker who dies of \"beef poisoning\" in The Slaughterhouse, was portrayed by regular cast member Hank Azaria, who voices many characters in the series. Barclay's voice is slightly based on that of American actor Gary Busey. The two Jehovah's witnesses were portrayed by Pamela Hayden and Karl Wiedergott.\n\nIn \"Voyages of Discovery: A Manly Adventure in the Lands Down Under\", a book about adventuring and masculinity, Ken Ewell described \"Maximum Homerdrive\" as a \"fine example\" of \"the poor man's lack of travel acumen\". He wrote \"Homer's usual ineptitude at first spells disaster for the duo, at least until they find out about the truck's auto-drive system. And though he promises to keep the device a secret, Homer can't keep his mouth shut, and so shamefully exposes to the world his un-manful behavior concerning the mates. So given that Homer once again learns absolutely nothing from his traveling experience, he can only take to heart the thoughts of the British writer Stephen Fry. 'At my age travel broadens the behind.'\"\n\nThe decal on Homer's truck reads \"Rex Rascal\", a reference to American animator Tex Avery. In the steak restaurant, a photo of actor and comedian Tony Randall can be seen next to Barclay's photo. Homer's postcard, which reads \"Wish you were her\", shows a picture of American model Bettie Page. In the scene where Homer drives Barclay's truck into the convoy, Navitron Autodrive System says \"I'm afraid I can't let you do this, Red. The risk is unacceptable.\" The line, as well as the Navitron Autodrive System's, is a reference to HAL 9000, the antagonist in the 1968 science fiction film \"\". The episode also references media mogul Ted Turner, with a sign that reads \"Atlanta: the home of Ted Turner's mood swings\". The title of the episode references the infamous 1986 Stephen King movie \"Maximum Overdrive\", which was one of Simpsons cast member Yeardley Smith's first credited screen roles.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on March 28, 1999, \"Maximum Homerdrive\" received a 9.4 rating/15 percent share, according to Nielsen Media Research, meaning it was seen by 9.4 percent of the population and 15 percent of the people watching television at the time of its broadcast. Among adults between ages 18 and 49, the episode received a 7.8 rating/20 percent share, the strongest rating \"The Simpsons\" had in the demographic since \"Wild Barts Can't Be Broken\", which aired on January 17 the same year. Tom Bierbaum of \"Variety\" credited the boost in ratings to the premiere of \"Futurama\", which aired after \"Maximum Homerdrive\", writing that \"Sunday's \"Futurama\" preview energized Fox's entire lineup\" that night. On August 7, 2007, \"Maximum Homerdrive\" was released as part of \"The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD box set. Matt Groening, Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Ron Hauge, Matt Selman, Swinton O. Scott III and Mike B. Anderson participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode.\n\nFollowing its home video release, \"Maximum Homerdrive\" received mixed reviews from critics. James Plath of DVD Town described it as \"funny,\" and Brian Tallerico of UGO Networks considered it to be one of the season's best episodes, describing it as having \"some awesome road comedy.\" Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\" gave the episode a positive review as well, writing \"The life of the trucker, as made popular in C. W. McCall's 1976 hit single \"Convoy\", is brought to life here in all its glory. For once, Homer is in the right and you cannot help but cheer as the truckers spectacularly fail to stop him getting to Atlanta.\" They concluded by writing \"A nice, bonding story for Homer and Bart which is diametrically opposed to the one featuring Marge and Lisa.\" On the other hand, giving the episode a more mixed review, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote \"If nothing else, 'Homerdrive' takes unanticipated paths. The eating contest leads to a long truck drives leads to that 'shocking secret'. All of this means the show manages to become pretty unpredictable.\" However, he maintained that the episode is only \"sporadically\" funny, and that it \"doesn’t ever excel in that department – at least not in terms of the trucker story.\" He enjoyed the episode's B-story more, because of its \"absurdity\", however he criticized the inclusion of Gil in the episode, calling the character \"increasingly overused\". Jake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News gave the episode a mixed review as well, writing that it \"may have been a fairly decent episode but for the fact that something similar was done (and done better) on \"King of the Hill\".\"\n\n\n"}

He was the sixth but third and youngest surviving son of Frederick Christian, Elector of Saxony and the composer Princess Maria Antonia Walpurgis of Bavaria.\n\nSince he was the youngest son of the family, Maximilian initially had little chance to inherit the Electorate of Saxony. However, by 1800, Maximilian was the third in line to the Electorate, because all the children of his two older brothers, Frederick Augustus and Anthony, died in infancy, except Maria Augusta, Frederick Augustus's only surviving offspring. After the creation of the Kingdom of Saxony in 1806, Maximilian became a Prince of Saxony.\n\nAfter the death of Frederick Augustus in 1827, Anthony succeeded him as King. Maximilian became first in line to the Saxon throne as Hereditary Prince (German: \"Thronfolger\").

There are about 600,000 speakers of a dozen languages. They are tonal languages – most, like Dogul, having two tones; some, like Donno So, having three. The basic word order is subject–object–verb.\n\nThe evidence linking Dogon to the Niger–Congo family is weak, and their place within the family, assuming they do belong, is not clear. Various theories have been proposed, placing them in Gur, Mande, or as an independent branch, the last now being the preferred approach. The Dogon languages show no remnants of the noun class system characteristic of much of Niger–Congo, leading linguists to conclude that they likely diverged from Niger–Congo very early.\n\nRoger Blench comments,\nand:\n\nThe Bamana and Fula languages have exerted significant influence on Dogon, due to their close cultural and geographical ties.\n\nBlench (2015) suggests that Bangime and Dogon languages may have a substratum from a \"missing\" branch of Nilo-Saharan that had split off relatively early from Proto-Nilo-Saharan, and tentatively calls that branch \"Plateau\".\n\nThe Dogon consider themselves a single ethnic group, but recognise that their languages are different. In Dogon cosmology, Dogon constitutes six of the twelve languages of the world (the others being Fulfulde, Mooré, Bambara, Bozo and Tamasheq). Jamsay is thought to be the original Dogon language, but the Dogon \"recognise a myriad of tiny distinctions even between parts of villages and sometimes individuals, and strive to preserve these\". (Hochstetler 2004:18)\n\nThe best-studied Dogon language is the escarpment language Toro So (Tɔrɔ sɔɔ) of Sanga, due to Marcel Griaule's studies there and because Toro So was selected as one of thirteen national languages of Mali. It is mutually intelligible with other escarpment varieties. However, the plains languages—Tene Ka, Tomo Ka, and Jamsay, which are not intelligible with Toro so—have more speakers, and Jamsay and Tommo so are most conservative linguistically.\n\nCalame-Griaule appears to have been the first to work out the various varieties of Dogon. Calame-Griaule (1956) classified the languages as follows, with accommodation given for languages which have since been discovered (new Dogon languages were reported as late as 2005), or have since been shown to be mutually intelligible (as Hochstetler confirmed for the escarpment dialects). The two standard languages are asterisked.\n\n\nDouyon and Blench (2005) report an additional variety, which is as yet unclassified:\n\nBlench noted that the plural suffix on nouns suggests that Budu is closest to Mombo, so it has been tentatively included as West Dogon above. He also notes that Walo–Kumbe is lexically similar to Naŋa; Hochstetler suspects it may be Naŋa. The similarities between these languages may be shared with Yanda. These are all extremely poorly known.\n\nBangime language ( Baŋgɛri mɛ), formerly considered a divergent branch of Dogon, turns out not to be Dogon at all, and is possibly a language isolate (Blench 2005b). Blench believes that it is a remnant of the pre-Dogon languages of the area; the Dogon appear to have been in the area for many thousands of years.\n\nAdditionally, Blench (2015) suggests that there is a Nilo-Saharan substratum in the Dogon languages, with the Nilo-Saharan substrate being a currently extinct branch of Nilo-Saharan that Blench tentatively refers to as \"Plateau.\"\n\nComparison of numerals in individual languages:\n\n\n\n"}

It was co-produced (along with the band) by Jerry Finn. The album was recorded at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, CA. The music, contrary to previous recordings by the band, contained a combination of string orchestras, pianos, sitars, organs, and other out-of-the-ordinary instrumentation.\n\nThe label believed that the intent of the band was to go purposely against their will with the overall sound of the album and not create any \"hit songs,\" and did not expect the fully orchestrated sound the band conveyed on this album. (The band has admitted as much later that they were taking advantage of the money Elektra provided to them in order to create the best studio album they could, regardless of the label's demands for radio hits, knowing that they might never have that kind of funding again.)\n\nTo date the album is considered their most accomplished album, but many critics considered it radio-unfriendly.

{"id": "1822282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822282", "title": "Male", "text": "Male\n\nA male (♂) organism is the physiological sex that produces sperm. Each spermatozoon can fuse with a larger female gamete, or ovum, in the process of fertilization. A male cannot reproduce sexually without access to at least one ovum from a female, but some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most male mammals, including male humans, have a Y chromosome, which codes for the production of larger amounts of testosterone to develop male reproductive organs. \nNot all species share a common sex-determination system. In most animals, including humans, sex is determined genetically; however, species such as \"Cymothoa exigua\" change sex depending on the number of females present in the vicinity.\n\nThe existence of two sexes seems to have been selected independently across different evolutionary lineages (see convergent evolution). The repeated pattern is sexual reproduction in isogamous species with two or more mating types with gametes of identical form and behavior (but different at the molecular level) to anisogamous species with gametes of male and female types to oogamous species in which the female gamete is very much larger than the male and has no ability to move. There is a good argument that this pattern was driven by the physical constraints on the mechanisms by which two gametes get together as required for sexual reproduction.\n\nAccordingly, sex is defined operationally across species by the type of gametes produced (i.e.: spermatozoa vs. ova) and differences between males and females in one lineage are not always predictive of differences in another.\n\nMale/female dimorphism between organisms or reproductive organs of different sexes is not limited to animals; male gametes are produced by chytrids, diatoms and land plants, among others. In land plants, \"female\" and \"male\" designate not only the female and male gamete-producing organisms and structures but also the structures of the sporophytes that give rise to male and female plants.\n\nA common symbol used to represent the male sex is the Mars symbol ♂, a circle with an arrow pointing northeast. The Unicode symbol is:\nThe symbol is identical to the planetary symbol of Mars. It was first used to denote sex by Carl Linnaeus in 1751. The symbol is often called a stylized representation of the Roman god Mars' shield and spear. According to Stearn, however, all the historical evidence favours that it is derived from \"θρ\", the contraction of the Greek name for the planet Mars, which is Thouros.\n\nThe sex of a particular organism may be determined by a number of factors. These may be genetic or environmental, or may naturally change during the course of an organism's life. Although most species with male and female sexes have individuals that are either male or female, hermaphroditic animals, such as worms, have both male and female reproductive organs.\n\nMost mammals, including humans, are genetically determined as such by the XY sex-determination system where males have an XY (as opposed to XX) sex chromosome. It is also possible in a variety of species, including humans, to be XXY or have other intersex/hermaphroditic qualities, though one would still be considered genotypically (if not necessarily phenotypically) male so long as one has a Y-chromosome. During reproduction, a male can give either an X sperm or a Y sperm, while a female can only give an X egg. A Y sperm and an X egg produce a male, while an X sperm and an X egg produce a female.\n\nThe part of the Y-chromosome which is responsible for maleness is the sex-determining region of the Y-chromosome, the SRY. The SRY activates Sox9, which forms feedforward loops with FGF9 and PGD2 in the gonads, allowing the levels of these genes to stay high enough in order to cause male development; for example, Fgf9 is responsible for development of the spermatic cords and the multiplication of Sertoli cells, both of which are crucial to male sexual development.\n\nThe ZW sex-determination system, where males have a ZZ (as opposed to ZW) sex chromosome may be found in birds and some insects (mostly butterflies and moths) and other organisms. Members of the insect order Hymenoptera, such as ants and bees, are often determined by haplodiploidy, where most males are haploid and females and some sterile males are diploid.\n\nIn some species of reptiles, such as alligators, sex is determined by the temperature at which the egg is incubated. Other species, such as some snails, practice sex change: adults start out male, then become female. In tropical clown fish, the dominant individual in a group becomes female while the other ones are male.\n\nIn some arthropods, sex is determined by infection. Bacteria of the genus \"Wolbachia\" alter their sexuality; some species consist entirely of ZZ individuals, with sex determined by the presence of \"Wolbachia\".\n\nIn those species with two sexes, males may differ from females in ways other than the production of spermatozoa. In many insects and fish, the male is smaller than the female. In seed plants, which exhibit alternation of generations, the female and male parts are both included within the sporophyte sex organ of a single organism. In mammals, including humans, males are typically larger than females. In birds, the male often exhibits a colorful plumage that attracts females.\n\n"}
{"id": "1822287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822287", "title": "Canadian Senate divisions", "text": "Canadian Senate divisions\n\nCanadian Senate divisions refers to two aspects of the Senate of Canada. First, it refers to the division of Canada into four regional Senate divisions of 24 senators each, as set out in the Constitution of Canada (as defined in subsection 52(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982, consisting of the Canada Act 1982 (including the Constitution Act, 1982), all acts and orders referred to in the schedule (including the Constitution Act, 1867, formerly the British North America Act), and any amendments to these documents. The four regions are the Western Provinces, Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes. These regions are intended to serve the Senate's purpose of providing regional representation in the Parliament of Canada, in contrast to the popular representation that the House of Commons is intended to provide. While not within any of the original four Senate divisions, Senate seats are also allocated to Newfoundland and Labrador and the three territories. The four divisions can be expanded when the need arises to have an extra two senators appointed to each regional division.\n\nSecond, it refers to divisions within a province represented by senators from the Canadian Senate, also known as \"senatorial designation\". Under the Constitution, only Quebec has official Senate divisions for each of the senatorial designations within the province. In all other provinces, Senators are appointed to represent the province as a whole and the Constitution makes no reference to official senatorial designations for those provinces. Senators from provinces outside Quebec may simply \"designate\" a district they wish to symbolically represent within their province, which can be named at the time of their appointment or at a later time. These senate divisions have no specific geographic boundaries though their names often give a reference to a general geographic area. However a senator will sometimes create boundaries for their senate division even though it has no legal status. While relatively rare, a senator outside of Quebec can change his or her division in the same manner as party affiliation, simply by notifying the Clerk of the Senate.\n\nUnlike the House of Commons, seats in the Canadian Senate are not based upon any population measure or adjusted by population (an exception to this was set out under the \"Manitoba Act\", in which Manitoba's allotment increased until the province reached a target population). Rather, they are fixed under the Constitution Act 1867 (in the case of Quebec), or are established upon the appointment of a senator and cease to exist when the senator leaves office (outside of Quebec).\n\nThe Constitution also provides that a province cannot have fewer seats in the House of Commons than it has in the Senate. There are currently 105 seats in the Canadian Senate. Seats are divided among provinces and territories and can only change with a constitutional amendment, or a constitutional provision that allows seats to change based on certain conditions. Beyond the constitutional allotment of Senate seats per province, the seats are grouped into four regions of 24 seats. Provisions under section 26 of the \"Constitution Act\" exist to add up to two extra seats per region, with no more than 113 members allowed to sit in the Senate. \n\nSenators have the same constitutional provisions to offer services as members of the House of Commons. This includes a rarely used provision to maintain a constituency office. Three senators currently have such offices. Two of the three have not designated themselves to a specific division, but to represent their province as a whole. While constituency offices are rare, all senators maintain an office on Parliament Hill.\n\nNote:\n\nThe Quebec regional division was created in 1867, at the time of confederation. Quebec has had 24 seats since 1867. The region covers the entire province. Quebec is unique in each of its 24 senatorial designations are set out in the \"Constitution Act of 1867\" and defined in the \"Consolidated Statutes of Canada 1859\". These divisions are the same as those that Canada East held in the Legislative Council of Canada prior to Canadian confederation. The stated purpose of retaining the Senate divisions within Quebec is to protect the interests of religious and linguistic minorities inside the province. Quebec senators must own property in their represented divisions.\n\nAn exception to the requirement for Quebec senators to represent a specific division occurs when the Prime Minister directly advises the Sovereign to temporarily expand the Senate under the Regional Expansion Clause in Section 26 of the \"British North America Act\". This clause can be used to increase the Senate seats by 1 or 2 senators for each region, including Quebec. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is to date the only one to successfully exercise this clause, on September 27, 1990. Under the clause, Senators Normand Grimard and Thérèse Lavoie-Roux represented self-designated divisions within Quebec following their appointments to the Senate. Senators appointed under Section 26 may name a senatorial designation of their own choosing in the same manner as a Senator from the other nine provinces and any such self-designation carries similar status.\n\nQuebec's Senate divisions have not changed since confederation and remain based on the province's 1867 boundaries. Although the territory of the Province of Quebec has expanded northward twice (in 1898 and 1912) the division boundaries were never changed to accommodate the boundary changes, thus leaving Northern Quebec unrepresented in the Senate. At the time, this was a relatively uncontroversial anomaly because the additional territory was primarily populated by First Nations peoples, who would not gain the right to vote until the 1960s.\n\nNote:\n\"See List of Quebec senators\"\n\nThe Ontario regional division was created at the time of confederation in 1867. The region covers the entire province and has not had any changes in seat numbers since 1867.\n\nOntario has been the most populous province and region in Canada since the birth of the country in 1867. The province has expanded its boundaries twice, to cover land once part of the Northwest Territories. Ontario also holds more seats in the House of Commons of Canada than any other province.\n\nThe capital of Canada, Ottawa is located within Ontario.\nNote:\n\n\"See List of Ontario senators\"\n\nThe Western provinces regional division was created under the \"Constitution Act, 1915\" to bring the total to four regional divisions. Six senators would represent each of the four western provinces Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan for a total of 24 senators.\n\nPrior to 1915 the provinces were not organized into a region, and had their own path of evolution. Manitoba gained seats on a set population expansion clause. Alberta and Saskatchewan gained seats from the Northwest Territories. British Columbia was given seats outlined in the \"Terms of Union\".\n\nAlberta has held popular elections for senators, although the Prime Minister is not obliged to nominate the winner of any such election to the Senate. Nonetheless, three winners of such elections have been nominated to the Senate: Senator Stan Waters was elected in the 1989 Alberta Senate nominee election, and Senators Bert Brown and Betty Unger were elected Senators-in-Waiting in 2004.\n\nThe Maritimes regional division was created in 1867. At the time of confederation the division contained only Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. It was expected that Prince Edward Island would also join; however, it held out until 1873 as it sought equal representation by province rather than by region. At the Quebec Conference of 1864 the Prince Edward Island representatives believed the only safeguard for a small province would be an equal representation in the Senate. Prince Edward Island held out joining Canada until 1873 and ended up accepting the four senate seats.\n\nOn June 5, 2006 New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord announced his province's support for possible Senate elections to be held during the New Brunswick municipal election cycle, joining Alberta as the only province actively pursuing elected Senators. Among his proposal was a plan to divide New Brunswick into five Regions or Divisions and have each represented by two Senators. Another possibility of the proposal was to have Senators remain at large for the province.\n\nDuring the Quebec Conference of 1864 it was determined that Newfoundland and Labrador was a distinct region and that the territory should exist as an exception outside of the equal regional divisions, if it should enter Canada. When Newfoundland and Labrador entered confederation in 1949 the \"Newfoundland Act\" confirmed the original terms of union and was given six seats in the Senate.\n\n\"See List of Newfoundland and Labrador senators\n\nThe Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut are currently represented by one senator each. The Northwest Territories joined the confederation in 1870 but did not gain representation in the Senate until 1879. The territory was granted two more seats in 1903. After Alberta and Saskatchewan were created in 1905 the Northwest Territories lost representation in the Senate until 1975 when it regained one seat under the \"Constitution Act 1975\".\n\nThe Yukon was created out of the Northwest Territories in 1898 but did not get representation in the Senate until it was granted one seat under the \"Constitution Act 1975\".\n\nNunavut was granted one seat under the \"Nunavut Act 1993\" when the territory was created out of the Northwest Territories in 1999. \n\nNote:\n\"See List of Canadian territorial senators\n\n"}

Bennett is celebrated for having provoked the decision that the doctrine of the Real Presence is a dogma not inconsistent with the creed of the Church of England. This followed the publication of his pamphlet \"A Plea for Toleration in the Church of England\" (1867) in the form of a letter to Edward Bouverie Pusey.\n\nBennett was born at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 15 November 1804, the eldest of three sons of Major William Bennett, RE, and Mary Early, daughter of James Early, an officer of the 1st Royal Garrison Battalion. His younger brother, George Augustus Bennett (1807-45), like their father, served in the Corps of Royal Engineers, Board of Ordnance. His youngest brother, Frederick Hamilton Bennett (1816–73), ordained to the curacy of Daventry (1840), Curate-in-charge of St John's, Worcester (1842–51), Master of Arts, Christ Church, Oxford (1843), served his final appointment as the first vicar of Saint Mary the Virgin, Freeland, Oxfordshire, from 1869.\n\nBennett was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford (BA, 1827, MA, 1829). He married Mary Concetta Franklin in 1828, prior to being ordained a priest by the Bishop of London on 6 June 1830. He initially served in 1830 as curate of Oxford Chapel (later called St. Peter's, Vere Street, London), but he soon moved to curacies at Holy Trinity Church Marylebone (1830–1833), followed by All Souls Church, Langham Place (1833–1838). For a while he held this latter post alongside the Perpetual curacy of Portman Chapel, Portman Square 1836-1841). His post was subsequently redesignated as Perpetual curate of St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge and St Barnabas, Pimlico. He supervised the completion of the former church and was effectively the founder of the latter. At the same time he conceived the idea of establishing a college there to accommodate the priests and its choristers. In 1851 he felt obliged to resign these posts following doctrinal complaints and a theological dispute with his bishop, Charles James Blomfield - after being accused of ritualism.

The three stations share studios on Constitution Avenue near the Capitol Building; WFDC shares transmitter facilities with CW affiliate WDCW (channel 50) in the Tenleytown section of Washington's northwest quadrant. WFDC also serves as the \"de facto\" Univision outlet for the Baltimore market.\n\nOn cable, the station is available on channel 14 on most systems in the Washington area and on channel 11 in Baltimore (the latter market's NBC affiliate, WBAL-TV, broadcasts over-the-air on channel 11, but is carried on channel 21 due to signal issues that existed during the analog era).\n\nChannel 14 first signed on as WOOK-TV on March 5, 1963 as the first television station in the country aimed at the African-American demographic. WOOK's claim to fame was their teen-oriented dance show called \"Teenarama\", which featured big-name acts such as James Brown and Marvin Gaye. In 1968, the station changed its call letters, to WFAN-TV (the WFAN call letters are now used on a radio station at 660 AM in New York City). From 1968 to 1972, channel 14 was the sister station to WMET-TV (channel 24) in Baltimore, Maryland. Both stations were owned by United Broadcasting. On February 12, 1972, WFAN-TV went dark after accumulating financial difficulties and due to license hearings affecting its sister stations.\n\nChannel 14 was back on the air by 1976 in the form of translator W14AA, relaying Central Virginia Educational Television Corporation's WNVT from Annandale, Virginia. CVETC attempted to have the full-powered channel 14 allocation moved to Fairfax, but this request was denied. What was to become WNVC was constructed on channel 56 instead, and upon its sign-on in June 1981 W14AA was no longer necessary. CVETC received special approval to broadcast Congressional hearings in the interim; later in the year, the station was sold to Los Cerezos Television Co., who converted it to an affiliate of the Spanish International Network (Univision's predecessor). This station moved to channel 48 in 1989 and is today WMDO-CD.\n\nA new station on channel 14 signed on as WTMW on August 3, 1993; the call letters came from the initials of the station's owner, Theodore M. White. From 1997 to May 1999, WTMW aired programming from America's Store, a discount shopping channel operated by the Home Shopping Network.\nIn May 1999, WTMW began airing the new Military Channel (not related to the cable channel of the same name owned by Discovery Communications, which is now the American Heroes Channel). After the Military Channel stopped broadcasting one month later, channel 14 aired programming from the Panda Shopping Network. Channel 14 became an affiliate of the American Independent Network in December 1999, which primarily broadcast reruns of old sitcoms and infomercials. The channel changed affiliations again in January 2001, when it became an affiliate of the Renaissance Network.\n\nNone of these formats were financially viable and in November 2001, Theodore M. White sold the station to Univision Communications and its call letters were changed to WFDC. Univision already had a Washington affiliate on channel 47, WMDO-CA (that station's owner, Entravision Communications, would take over WFDC through a local marketing agreement), so WFDC instead became one of the first flagship stations of their new network TeleFutura. The network was created to directly compete with Telemundo for the Latino American demographic, since Univision is more Mexican-oriented. Telefutura first broadcast on January 14, 2002 and channel 14 has done better financially since then.\n\nOn January 1, 2006, WFDC and WMDO swapped network affiliations: WFDC affiliated with Univision, while WMDO took the TeleFutura affiliation.\n\nOn April 3, 2014, Katz Broadcasting announced plans to multicast Grit and Escape on WFDC's DT3 and DT4 subchannels. The two networks began broadcasting on August 18, 2014. Escape was replaced by Katz's Bounce TV on September 30, 2017.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWFDC does not carry WMDO-CD on a subchannel due to separate legal ownership; although WFDC is managed by Entravision, the license is held by Univision. In 2001, Entravision purchased WJAL (channel 68) for the sole purpose of moving it from Hagerstown, Maryland to Silver Spring to take over as a full-market UniMás affiliate, although they were unsuccessful. WJAL was eventually able to relocate to Silver Spring as a result of the 2016–17 television spectrum reallocation, although it currently airs the SonLife Broadcasting Network (SBN) instead.\n\nWFDC shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 14, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition UHF channel 15. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 14.\n\nAfter switching from TeleFutura to Univision, the station continued its news department. It broadcast 6 hours of news on weekdays and 2 hours of news on the weekends. On September 30, 2012, \"Buenos Días DC\", the first Spanish morning news show in the Washington market, debuted. The show was produced by Silvana Quiroz, who is also the anchor sharing cameras with co-anchor Nestor Bravo. The morning news magazine ran from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. On April 19, 2014, a weekend newscast debuted at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. and ran through October 2015 and was similar to the weekday schedule. On March 1, 2014, the Univision Washington team was replaced. Anchor Mario Sol and Sports Anchor Oscar Burgos were laid-off. Maria Rosa Lucchini, the 6 p.m. anchor, was promoted to White House correspondent; months later, she resigned. Claudia Uceda, the 11 p.m. anchor, was switched to reporter, and months later, resigned to work as a freelancer for the Univision network. Tsi-Tsi-Ki Félix replaced the entire team, leaving only Fanny Gutierrez, who at the time was on maternity leave, and months later, resigned from her duties. Edwin Pitti, who was hired as a reporter, was promoted to White House correspondent.\n\nIn late December 2015, Entravision cancelled the morning newscasts of all of its stations in the United States (including \"Buenos Días DC\"). The last show aired December 7, 2015. \n\n"}

{"id": "1822338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822338", "title": "Ōei Invasion", "text": "Ōei Invasion\n\nThe , known as the Gihae Eastern Expedition (기해 동정) in Korea, was a 1419 invasion from Joseon against pirate bases on Tsushima Island, which is located in the middle of the Tsushima Strait between the Korean Peninsula and Kyushu.\n\nThe Japanese identifying phrase derives from the \"Ōei\" era (1394–1428), which is the Japanese era name of the calendar system in use in Japan. The corollary Korean identifying title derives from \"Gihae\" in the Chinese sexagenary cycle of the calendar system then in use in Joseon. In both, the terms are explicit equivalents for the Gregorian calendar year of 1419.\n\nFrom about 1400, despite its incorporation into the Japanese political order (this incorporation was however limited, to the point that Japanese authorities, regional and national, were unable throughout most of Japanese history to control and limit pirate activity originating in this area) before the Goryeo, Tsushima were located on the front lines that defended Japanese territory for much of its history. Historically, a large part of Tsushima's economy was sustained by trade with Korea; it was used as a \"frontier territory\" and a diplomatic meeting place between Korea and Japan, but was considered historically by Koreans as a vassal or dependent state of Korea, and despite a variety of changes in terminology over the ages designed to indicate its status as being in the Japanese sphere of influence, it was considered by many Koreans to be Korean land under foreign occupation.\n\nFrom the end of the Goryeo through the early Joseon, the coastal regions of Korea, their populations, and their resources were often the objective of Wokou raids.\n\nIn 1389, General Pak Wi (박위, 朴威) of Goryeo cleared the island of Wokou pirates, he burnt 300 ships and rescued more than 100 Korean captives. The Joseon Dynasty ordered a strengthening of Korean naval defenses, a strategic response to the constant threat posed by the pirates. In 1396, Korean official Kim Sa-hyeong (김사형, 金士衡) led a campaign into Tsushima.\n\nJoseon subsequently asked the Ashikaga shogunate and its deputy in Kyūshū to suppress pirate activity, favoring legitimate traders. In exchange for certain privileges, it gave authority to Sō Sadashige (the de facto ruler of Tsushima Province) over ships sailing from Japan to Korea. When Sō Sadashige died in 1418, power was seized from Sadashige's infant son Sadamori (Tsutsukumaru) by Soda Saemontaro, a powerful pirate leader. Suffering from famine, pirates on Tsushima invaded Ming China in 1419. On the way to China, they invaded Korea's Bi-in and Haeju country after their demands for food were rejected.\n\nAfter receiving reports of these incidents, the Korean court approved an expedition of Tsushima. Taejong, who had abdicated his throne in 1418 but was still a military adviser of Sejong the Great, favored a more offensive approach. On June 9, 1419, Taejong declared a war against Tsushima, citing that it belonged to Joseon, and Yi Jong-mu was chosen to conduct the expedition.\n\nThe Koreans waited until a large Japanese fleet had left the island for a raid. Yi Jong-mu's fleet of 227 ships and 17,285 soldiers set off from Geoje Island toward Tsushima on June 19, 1419. The following day the fleet landed in Asō Bay (浅茅湾).\n\nGeneral Yi Jong-mu first sent captured Japanese pirates as emissaries to ask for surrender. When he received no reply, he sent out expeditionary forces, and the soldiers proceeded to raid the islanders and pirates and plunder pirate settlements. He found and rescued 131 Chinese captives of the pirates and 21 slaves on the island, burned 129 ships and 1,939 houses, and killed or captured 135 pirates.\n\nOn the 26th, the Korean army was ambushed on land by a Japanese army at Nii, and suffered 150 casualties. The ambush was known to the locals as the Battle of Nukadake ().\n\nIn the weeks that followed, a truce was negotiated with the Sō clan on the island. The Korean expeditionary force withdrew and sailed back to the Korean Peninsula on July 3, 1419. and Korea gave up occupation of Tsushima. In subsequent diplomatic exchanges, Tsushima would be granted trading privileges with Joseon, in exchange for maintaining control and order of pirate threats originating from the island.\n\nA treaty was negotiated between Joseon and the Sō clan on January 1420. The Joseon government agreed to grant the Sō clan limited trading privileges and access to three coastal Korean ports, under the condition that the Sō clan control and stop any coastal pirate raids. On the 6th day of the 7th month in 1422, an emissary from the Sō clan requested freedom for Japanese prisoners of war captured by the Korean forces. He offered tributes of copper and sulfur in return. On the 20th day 12th month in 1422, all Japanese prisoners of war were released.\n\nIn 1443, the Daimyō of Tsushima, proposed a Gyehae treaty. The number of trade ships from Tsushima to Korea was decided by this treaty, and the Sō clan monopolized the trade with Korea.\n\nIn 1510, Japanese traders initiated an uprising against Joseon's stricter policies on Japanese traders from Tsushima and Iki coming to Busan, Ulsan and Jinhae to trade. The So Clan supported the uprising, but it was eventually suppressed by local authorities. The uprising was later came to be known as the \"Japanese riots in Southeast Korea\" (삼포왜란, 三浦倭亂).\n\nA more restrictive treaty was re-imposed under the direction of King Jungjong in 1512, but this Treaty of Imsin was enacted only under strictly limited terms, and only twenty-five ships were allowed to visit Joseon annually until \"Japanese riots in Saryangjin\" (사량진왜변, 蛇梁鎭倭變) in 1544.\n\nThe Korean export included rice, cotton, ginseng, and Sutra texts. In exchange, the Sō clan provided copper, tin, sulfur, medicinal herbs, and spices from both Tsushima island and Japan. The Sō clan became a trading hub between Korea and Japan and benefited greatly from it.\n\nThe relationship between Korea and residents of Tsushima Island greatly improved thereafter; there were numerous records of hospitality towards shipwrecked Korean sailors who ended up on the island, and merchants from Tsushima Island enjoyed special privileges in Korean ports.\n\nIn Kyoto, rumors of the invasion spread around the end of the 6th month. The raid was associated with the Mongol Invasions of Japan. Between the 7th and 8th month, Shōni Mitsusada, the overlord of the Sō clan, reported to the Ashikaga shogunate that the Shōni's deputy Sō Uemon had defeated Korean invaders. However, Korean captives were reported to have stated that forces from Ming China were planning to invade Japan. Since \"shōgun\" Ashikaga Yoshimochi took a harder stance toward the Ming than his father Yoshimitsu, the threat was taken seriously by the shogunate. Later, the \"shōgun\" received a report from the Kyūshū Deputy. Since it was considerably different from the Shōni's version, the \"shōgun\" felt the necessity of examining Korea's real intentions.\n\nIn a letter to Sō Sadamori issued on the 15th of the 7th month, the Joseon claimed that Tsushima belonged to Gyeongsang Province and asked him to leave the island, either by coming to the Korean Peninsula or by retreating to mainland Japan. In the 9th month, a man who claimed to be an envoy of Sō Sadamori arrived in Korea. The conditions he presented seemed unsatisfactory to the Joseon. Taejong made similar demands of the envoy in the 10th month. According to the article on the 10th day of the first leap month of 1420 of \"Sejong Sillok\", the same self-claimed envoy agreed to Korea's proposal to put Tsushima under the rule of Gyeongsang Province. On the 23rd of that month, the Korean court approved of this agreement. However, in later negotiations it was revealed that the envoy was not actually a representative of Sō Sadamori.\n\nIn the 11th month of 1419, envoys of Ashikaga Yoshimochi visited Korea. In return, King Sejong sent Song Hui-gyeong to Japan.\n\nThe diplomatic mission left the Joseon capital on the 15th day of the first leap month of 1420. The envoy continued on from Busan on the 15th day of the 2nd month. On the 21st, he met Soda Saemontaro on Tsushima as Sō Sadamori stayed with the Shōni clan in Hizen Province. He arrived in Kyoto in the 4th month. Having accomplished his mission, he left Kyoto in the 6th month, returning to Korea after completing negotiations with the Shōni and Sō clans in Kyūshū. He arrived in the capital in the 10th month, 1420.\n\nThis trip corrected mutual misunderstandings between Japan and Korea. In Tsushima, Song received a protest from Soda Saemontaro over a Korean document that stated Tsushima's dependence on Korea. He warned of the Shōni clan's possible military action. Song realized that Sō Sadamori had not been involved in the previous negotiations, and also learned of the Sō clan's vassalage to the Shōni clan. These realizations overturned Korea's plans towards Tsushima. In Kyoto, Song clarified that the Joseon had no intention of invading Japan. On their way back, Korean envoys faced the Sō and Shōni's hard-line attitude toward the Joseon.\n\nIn the 4th month of 1421, a letter under the name of Sō Sadamori demanded the return of Japanese captives and pointed out Korea's claim over Tsushima. It is noted that the Japanese envoy took advantage of the shogunate's authority, which can frequently be found in the Sō clan's later diplomatic talks with Korea. By the order of Taejong, Korea took a tough stance against the Sō clan. Although Soda's messengers visited Korea several times, they did not reach a settlement until 1423. The death of the hard-line Taejong in the 5th month of 1422 softened Korea's policy toward Japan. Under Sejong, Joseon relinquished its claims to Tsushima and decided to grant trade privileges to the Sō clan in exchange for its duty to maintain trade order.\n\nIn 1419, King Sejong, under the advice of his father and former king Taejong, decided to attack the enemy at Tsushima while the pirates were engaged in conflict with China. In the May 1419, notice of this plan was sent as an ultimatum to the Tsushima province authorities. In the war declaration against Tsushima government, the King claimed Tsushima, known as Daemado in Korean, had degraded due to the lack of interference on pirate activities by the local authority. Korea repeated necessary involvement in the island's operations, by aiding in the recent famine and general trade route policing led the ruler to declare the land would be reclaimed by force in order to protect the integrity of the region.\n\nDuring the conflicts, 180 Korean soldiers were killed. Another source recorded that about 100 Korean soldiers were killed and about 20 Japanese soldiers were killed.\n\nthe Korean soldiers burned 2,007 houses and 124 ships, and beheaded 123 pirates. The Korean forces also discovered Chinese and Korean captives there. The Korean armies were able to send 146 Chinese and 8 Korean hostages back to their homelands after releasing them from pirate captivity. Korean official Ryu Chong-hyon reported 180 Korean soldiers were dead during the expedition.\n\nIn the July 1419, King Taejo sent a letter to Tsushima's Sō Sadamori laying claim to the historical repossession of Daemado (Tsushima) due to the Korean victory in war. Once again the land was Korean territory as it had been under the Kingdom of Silla. An arrangement was proposed for Tsushima to enter into a tributary relationship. In the 9th month of 1419 Sadamori sent an emissary to surrender the territory and to present a variety of tribute to the Korean court. In January 1420, a Japanese envoy visiting Seoul requested to have a copy of Tripitaka Koreana, a comprehensive Buddhist script held in great regard as a Korean national treasure. King Sejong granted the request as sign of friendship between two countries. In the 1st leap month of 1420 Sadamori requested that the island officially become a state of Korea under the name of Daemado, also promising to personally become a subject and to manage the Wokou situation as an independent act of the state. King Sejong granted this request as well as allowing Sadamori to report to Gyeongsang province rather than Seoul.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its principle lies in the fact that variability which cannot be overcome (e.g. needing two batches of raw material to produce 1 container of a chemical) is confounded or aliased with a(n) (higher/highest order) interaction to eliminate its influence on the end product. High order interactions are usually of the least importance (think of the fact that temperature of a reactor or the batch of raw materials is more important than the combination of the two - this is especially true when more (3, 4, ...) factors are present); thus it is preferable to confound this variability with the higher interaction.\n\n\nIn the statistical theory of the design of experiments, blocking is the arranging of experimental units in groups (blocks) that are similar to one another. Typically, a blocking factor is a source of variability that is not of primary interest to the experimenter. An example of a blocking factor might be the sex of a patient; by blocking on sex, this source of variability is controlled for, thus leading to greater accuracy.\n\nIn Probability Theory the blocks method consists of splitting a sample into blocks (groups) separated by smaller subblocks so that the blocks can be considered almost independent. The blocks method helps proving limit theorems in the case of dependent random variables.\n\nThe blocks method was introduced by S. Bernstein:\n\nBernstein S.N. (1926) Sur l'extension du théorème limite du calcul des probabilités aux sommes de quantités dépendantes. Math. Annalen, v. 97, 1-59.\n\nThe method was successfully applied in the theory of sums of dependent random variables and in Extreme Value Theory:\n\nIbragimov I.A. and Linnik Yu.V. (1971) Independent and stationary sequences of random variables. Wolters-Noordhoff, Groningen.\n\nLeadbetter M.R., Lindgren G. and Rootzén H. (1983) Extremes and Related Properties of Random Sequences and Processes. New York: Springer Verlag.\n\nNovak S.Y. (2011) Extreme Value Methods with Applications to Finance. Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, London.\n\nWhen we can control nuisance factors, an important technique known as blocking can be used to reduce or eliminate the contribution to experimental error contributed by nuisance factors. The basic concept is to create homogeneous blocks in which the nuisance factors are held constant and the factor of interest is allowed to vary. Within blocks, it is possible to assess the effect of different levels of the factor of interest without having to worry about variations due to changes of the block factors, which are accounted for in the analysis.\n\nA nuisance factor is used as a blocking factor if every level of the primary factor occurs the same number of times with each level of the nuisance factor. The analysis of the experiment will focus on the effect of varying levels of the primary factor within each block of the experiment.\n\nThe general rule is:\nBlocking is used to remove the effects of a few of the most important nuisance variables. Randomization is then used to reduce the contaminating effects of the remaining nuisance variables. For important nuisance variables, blocking will yield higher significance in the variables of interest than randomizing.\n\nOne useful way to look at a randomized block experiment is to consider it as a collection of completely randomized experiments, each run within one of the blocks of the total experiment.\nwith\n\nSuppose engineers at a semiconductor manufacturing facility want to test whether different wafer implant material dosages have a significant effect on resistivity measurements after a diffusion process taking place in a furnace. They have four different dosages they want to try and enough experimental wafers from the same lot to run three wafers at each of the dosages.\n\nThe nuisance factor they are concerned with is \"furnace run\" since it is known that each furnace run differs from the last and impacts many process parameters.\n\nAn ideal way to run this experiment would be to run all the 4x3=12 wafers in the same furnace run. That would eliminate the nuisance furnace factor completely. However, regular production wafers have furnace priority, and only a few experimental wafers are allowed into any furnace run at the same time.\n\nA non-blocked way to run this experiment would be to run each of the twelve experimental wafers, in random order, one per furnace run. That would increase the experimental error of each resistivity measurement by the run-to-run furnace variability and make it more difficult to study the effects of the different dosages. The blocked way to run this experiment, assuming you can convince manufacturing to let you put four experimental wafers in a furnace run, would be to put four wafers with different dosages in each of three furnace runs. The only randomization would be choosing which of the three wafers with dosage 1 would go into furnace run 1, and similarly for the wafers with dosages 2, 3 and 4.\n\nLet \"X\" be dosage \"level\" and \"X\" be the blocking factor furnace run. Then the experiment can be described as follows:\n\nBefore randomization, the design trials look like:\nAn alternate way of summarizing the design trials would be to use a 4x3 matrix whose 4 rows are the levels of the treatment \"X\" and whose columns are the 3 levels of the blocking variable \"X\". The cells in the matrix have indices that match the \"X\", \"X\" combinations above.\n\nBy extension, note that the trials for any K-factor randomized block design are simply the cell indices of a \"k\" dimensional matrix.\n\nThe model for a randomized block design with one nuisance variable is\nwhere\n\n\nThe theoretical basis of blocking is the following mathematical result. Given random variables, \"X\" and \"Y\"\n\nThe difference between the treatment and the control can thus be given minimum variance (i.e. maximum precision) by maximising the covariance (or the correlation) between \"X\" and \"Y\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1822348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822348", "title": "Club Atlético Banfield", "text": "Club Atlético Banfield\n\nClub Atlético Banfield is an Argentine sports club located in the city of Banfield, Buenos Aires. Founded on 21 January 1896 by town residents of British origin (mostly from England and some from Scotland and Ireland), Banfield is mostly known for its football team, which currently plays in Primera División, the first division of the Argentine football league system.\n\nThe club's football greatest achievement was obtained in 2009 when it became champion of the Apertura, the first Primera División title won by the club. Apart from that championship, Banfield has also achieved two runners-up places, in 1951 and 2005. Banfield's main rival is Club Atlético Lanús, with which the club has a strong rivalry.\n\nOther sports practiced at the club include boxing, chess, field hockey, futsal, gymnastics, handball, roller skating, taekwondo, tennis and volleyball.\n\nIn the second half of the 1880s, many British families settled in the village of Banfield, located 14 miles south of Buenos Aires. These families, with their English-style houses and Victorian social dynamics, gave the suburbs a distinctly British profile. The history of the club began on 21 January 1896, when a group of professionals and English merchants residing in Banfield decided to found a club which they named after the village, which had been named after the railway station, established in 1873, which in turn was named after Edward Banfield, the first manager of the Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway. Heading the group of founders were Daniel Kingsland and George Burton, vice president and first. Kingsland was an exporter of cattle in Britain and an accountant while Burton was a Cambridge University graduate.\n\nThe pitch was a field for grazing located two blocks north of the railway station, next to the tracks on the east side. With Kingsland as president, cricket was the major sport, leaving football relegated to a background, which explains the poor performances of the club in football championships from 1897 to 1898, where the team finished at bottom places even suffering some of the largest defeats ever such as a 0–10 at the hands of defunct Flores AC.\n\nThis situation lasted until 1899, when Alfredo Goode (a football enthusiast) was named president. In 1899 Banfield won its first title, proclaiming Second Division champion over Español High School. Banfield remains the only club currently affiliated with the Argentine Football Association (AFA), that had won a title in the 19th. century.\n\nBanfield players were all born in Great Britain except the center half and captain James Dodds Watson, an Argentine native born in Buenos Aires. The following year (1900), as there was still no promotion, Banfield retained the Second Division championship. That time the club won the title without being defeated. Key players included the goalscorer Edward \"Invincible\" Potter, noted dribbler Charles Douglas Moffatt, captain Watson Dodds, and goalkeeper/president Goode.\n\nAfter that success, the club began to decline until December 1904, when Banfield was reorganized, with all of its assets liquidated to meet a hopeless bankruptcy. During those years, the figure of George Burton, another true lover of football, presided over the club until his death in 1928.\n\nIn 1908, the club's first team, playing in the Third Division, won the championship. In December 1910, a Banfield squad including William Peterson, Roger Jacobelli, Amador García, Carlos Lloveras, Galup Lanus and Bartholomew, amongst others, faced Racing Club in a two legged playoff for a place in the top division. The first match ended 0–0, with Racing finally winning, with a goal in extra time during the second match. In 1912, with the leadership of Captain Adolfo Pellens, Banfield won the championship for the third category thus the club ensured its return to second division. However, a restructuring of the tournament caused the first split in Argentine football, sending Banfield directly to the top category.\n\nBanfield made good performances in 1913 and 1914 tournaments, but when World War I began, many of the team's players, who were of British origin, were enrolled in the British Army and sent to the battlefront in Europe. In 1919, Banfield returned to the first division after beating defunct Del Plata in the final game.\n\nNewly promoted, Banfield was runner-up after champion Boca Juniors. In 1920, the team won the last edition of the Copa de Honor Municipalidad de Buenos Aires beating Boca Juniors 2–1 at Sportivo Barracas.\n\nIn 1919, Banfield joined dissident league Asociación Amateurs de Football, where the team played until it was dissolved in 1926. During that time, Banfield made irregular campaigns, finishing in the last positions of the fixture.\n\nIn 1928, club president George Burton died. He had chaired the club for over 20 years with a paternalistic attitude, cultivating and fervently supporting the amateur spirit of sport. His death created a large vacuum of power that plunged Banfield into a constitutional crisis for a decade.\n\nIn 1931, a group of clubs, led by the major teams, decided to professionalize football in Argentina. Therefore, a new league, the Liga Argentina de Football – which ended the covert professionalism that had occurred up till then – was established by the Argentine Football Association (AFA).\n\nBanfield was invited to join the professional Primera División, but its leaders believed that professionalism would fail in the short term, and instead chose to continue participating in the amateur tournament. Immediately Banfield players received offers from Primera División clubs and left the team.\n\nWith a decimated roster, Banfield participated in amateur tournament (\"Asociación Amateurs Argentina de Football\") until 1934. In 1935, Banfield joined AFA and was assigned to the Second Division. The team made poor campaigns, with less than 300 supporters per game. In 1938, Banfield finished last, being relegated to a lower division.\nIn late 1938, a group of members proposed to young entrepreneur Florencio Sola to take over the presidency of the club; although Banfield was in a critical situation, Sola nonetheless accepted. Taking advantage of Club Estudiantil Porteño (that played in second division) had been disaffiliated from the AFA, Florencio Sola acted to prevent Banfield dropping into the Third Division. To tackle the championship in 1939 Banfield obtained the loan of many players who were substitutes in the First Divisionand assembled a quality team that became champions winning the right to play in the Primera División.\n\nBanfield featured a completely new team for 1940 season. With players like Rafael Sanz, Eduardo Silvera, John Baptist Busuzzo, Alfredo De Terán, Armando Farro and others, the newspaper \"El Pampero\" nicknamed the team \"\"El Taladro\"\" (\"The Drill\"), which has remained the club's official nickname.\n\nBanfield's stadium (later named \"Florencio Sola\"), was built in 1940 in the city of Banfield. To celebrate its inauguration, a match against Independiente took place, which Banfield lost 1–0 with a goal by Arsenio Erico. In 1941, Banfield was punished with a 16-point deduction for attempted bribery, but after a great campaign, the team avoided being relegated in the last fixture, with a victory over Rosario Central.\n\nAfter the campaigns of 1942 and 1943, the school suffered several casualties and the team was relegated in 1944. The chair was occupied by Joseph Agulla in 1945, the year he did a good campaign in Second Division, but after a constitutional crisis later that year became Remigio Sola, brother of Florencio, became president. Chaired by Sola, the club formed a solid team for 1946 season, winning the second division championship with a season record that took over forty years to be broken.\n\nIn 1948, Florencio Sola became president for second time. Under his command, Banfield hired many players in order to form a strong team, although the club would not made a good campaign, nearly being relegated again. In the last five fixtures of that season, a strike of professional players was declared, thus all teams put youth players on the field. Renato Cesarini was Banfield coach during that period, obtaining 9/10 points which allowed Banfield to remain at first division.\n\nIn 1951, Félix José Ildefonso Martínez and Félix Zurdo in the coach equipper, finished equal first with Racing Club although they had the better goal difference and wins. The two finals were played in the defunct stadium of San Lorenzo (known as the \"Gasometer\"). The first ended in a goalless draw and in the second Racing won by the minimum difference. Featuring almost the same team, Banfield took fifth in the championship in 1952.\n\nIn 1953, key player Eliseo Mouriño was acquired by Boca Juniors, which significantly affected the team: the following year they finished last and relegated to second division. After seven years, Florencio Sola would not continue to lead the club in 1955 and presidential elections were held for the first time in the history of the institution. They faced the lists submitted by the groups \"traditionalist\" and \"Mr. Burton\", beating the first.\n\nMost notable in these years was in the lower divisions, where a team was champion of sixth, fifth, fourth and reserves between 1955 and 1958, which values emerged as the top scorer Luis Suárez Llanos Oscar Calics, Ezekiel and Horacio Benedetti. Valentín Suárez became president of the club in late 1958, and for the 1959 championship he assembled a team of first division players, mostly veterans.\n\nBut although pointer ended the first round, this \"star team\" did not achieve its main objective, promotion. Beginning in 1960, led by Benicio Acosta but also with the contribution of the great football knowledge Valentin Suarez had started a process that led to the rise after a major campaign in 1962. The arrival of quality players Ediberto Righi, Norberto Raffo, Oscar López, Luis Maidana and Roberto Zárate, supplemented with local players like Adolfo Vázquez, Oscar Llanos Ezequiel Calics and created a remarkable team that was third in 1960, second in 1961 and first in 1962. From 1963, the club began a period of 16 seasons in which they remained in First Division, with the exception of 1973.\n\nIn the first four years, the \"Drill\" made excellent seasons, finishing seventh in 1963 and 1964. Slowly, the campus was also being renovated. Thus came the likes of Julio San Lorenzo, Anacleto Peanno Diego Bay, Nelson López, Rubén Hugo and José Sanfilippo. It was in 1967 when Banfield performances began to decline even though the team included quality players like Jorge Carrascosa, Rubén Flotta and José Manuel Ramos Delgado. In 1969, he avoided relegation to Second Division after winning a home \"reclasificatorio\", but in 1972 failed to prevent relegation. In any case, the \"Drill\" took only one year to return to the higher division.\n\nCoached by Oscar López and Oscar Cavallero, Banfield became champion of Primera B (second division) in 1973. Ricardo La Volpe, Hugo Mateos, Silvio Sotelo, Eduardo and Juan Alberto Taverna were some notable players for the team.\n\nDuring its run on Primera División, Banfield made its best campaign during the 1976 National Championship, with Adolfo Pedernera as manager. But after poor performances during 1977 and 1978 tournaments, the team was relegated after being defeated at the hands of Platense.\n\nIn 1985, Ángel Cappa arrived to coach Banfield, forming the main structure of the team which would promote to Primera División two years later.\n\nBanfield did not have a good beginning during this decade, even playing in the relegation zone. The only notable moment was in the 1990–91 tournament, where the team reached the finals although it could not promote to Primera. For the 1992–93 season and with Suárez again as president (having been elected in 1991 for a fifth run), Banfield designed Carlos Babington as coach and acquired experienced players such as former River Plate goalkeeper Gabriel Puentedura, midfielder Fabio Lenguita and defender Gabriel Stafuza (who had played for Boca Juniors in the 1980s). Those footballers, plus some youth players such as Javier Sanguinetti (who made the highest number of appearances for the club to date, with over 450 matches) and Jorge Jiménez, helped Banfield to win the title and promotion to Primera División, after defeating Colón de Santa Fe in the finals.\n\nIn Primera, Banfield was coached by Oscar López and Oscar Cavallero, with a renovated squad where ex-Ferro Carril Oeste Oscar Acosta and experienced goalkeeper Ángel Comizzo (who had been relegated from River Plate by then coach Daniel Passarella were some of the new players. But it was a young Javier Zanetti who would be the revelation of the team at the end of the season. Banfield made good campaigns during its first years at Primera, although the team could not repeat those good performances in the successive tournaments, being finally relegated in 1997.\n\nThat same year, Banfield hired Patricio Hernández as the club's coach, but the team could not achieve good results under his direction. The next year, businessman Carlos Portel became new president of the institution, prevailing over the other candidate, Horace Sola (son of Florencio). The club was reported to be into a critical situation, so Portel announced that the main objective would be to reduce the club's debts.\n\nIn those years Banfield returned to Primera División, with playmaker and idol José Luis Sánchez as its most notable player. The first years at the top division of Argentine football the club was frequently in relegation zone, although the club achieved some historic results such as the 5–0 over River Plate in 2002 Apertura. Uruguayan Luis Garisto was the coach of the club during that period.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2003 Apertura, Julio César Falcioni replaced Garisto. Under his coaching, the club qualified to play continental tournaments for the first time in its history, taking part in 2004 Copa Sudamericana and 2005 Copa Libertadores, where the team reached the quarter-finals. In the domestic tournament, Banfield finished fifth at 2005 Clausura.\n\nBanfield also played the 2005 and 2006 editions of Copa Sudamericana, as well as the 2007 Copa Libertadores. Although this participations in South American championships, Banfield did not achieve good results at domestic seasons, with the exception of an outstanding 5–0 over arch-rival Lanús, the Argentine champion at that time.\n\nFrom 2008 Apertura until the next season, former world champion Jorge Burruchaga coached Banfield. After poor campaigns during that period, Julio Falcioni returned to the club to take over the team again.\n\nIn 2009, after an acceptable performance in the Torneo Clausura of that year, Banfield disputed the Apertura, still with Falcioni as coach. The most frequent line-up was: Cristian Lucchetti, Julio Barraza, Sebastián Méndez, Víctor López, Marcelo Bustamante, Maximiliano Bustos, Walter Erviti, Marcelo Quinteros, James Rodríguez, Sebastián Fernández and Santiago Silva (who later became the league top scorer). Banfield had a devastating start, defeating teams like Torneo Clausura 2009 champion Vélez Sársfield, Newell's Old Boys and drawing 0–0 with Rosario Central.\n\nAs tournament went by, Banfield gradually consolidated their leadership, being followed by Rosarian team Newell's Old Boys which also emerged as another strong candidate to win the title. Finally, after victories for Banfield and Newell's against Club Atlético Tigre and Gimnasia de La Plata, respectively, the two rivals came to the final game of the tournament with Banfield holding a two points lead over Newell's.\n\nOn 13 December 2009, although Banfield was beaten by Boca Juniors 0–2, the club achieved the championship due to Newell's Old Boys, its nearest rival, also being defeated by San Lorenzo, 2–0. These results produced a new champion in Argentine football. Club Atlético Banfield won its first championship in the top level of Argentine football.\n\nAfter winning its first title, Banfield played the 2010 Copa Libertadores where the team, placed second to Nacional de Montevideo in the first round, qualified to the next stage, but Banfield was eliminated by Internacional de Porto Alegre (which would be the champion). In the domestic tournament, Banfield finished fifth in the 2010 Clausura.\n\nBanfield also disputed some South American tournaments as the 2010 Copa Sudamericana (defeating Vélez Sarsfield, but the team lost to Colombian team Deportes Tolima. After finishing 15th in the 2010 Apertura, Falcioni resigned, ending his successful second tenure on the club after being hired by Boca Juniors to replace Claudio Borghi as manager.\n\nOn January 2011 Sebastián Méndez was named manager of the club. Banfield finished eighth in the 2011 Clausura and started the following tournament (2011 Apertura) losing four consecutive matches, which led to Méndez's resignation. After some provisional replacements as coaches, Ricardo La Volpe was chosen as new manager. La Volpe was fired only three months after his hiring. He had been involved in some controversies with some representative players of the institution, who even called president Carlos Portell to tell him they \"Could not stand La Volpe anymore\".\n\nUruguayan manager Jorge da Silva (who had previously worked in Godoy Cruz achieving a qualification to the Copa Libertadores) was hired to replace La Volpe since the 2012 Clausura. Banfield did not achieve good results, what precipitated Da Silva's resignation and his return to his country of origin. Eduardo Acevedo succeeded Da Silva but the team had another bad campaign, earning only 7 points from a possible 42.\n\nOn June 2012, Banfield was relegated to the second division (Primera B Nacional) after being defeated by Colón de Santa Fe 3–0. Banfield had placed last (19th of 19 teams) in the last two tournaments of Argentina. The team only won five games in both competitions, with 7 ties and 26 loses. Two days after, president Carlos Portell resigned, being accused of corruption by the fans and members of the club. Apart from Portell, of the managing left the club (including vice-president and treasurers), so a new election had to be held in order to choose a new chairman and managing for Banfield. The election was finally held in July 2012, being Eduardo Spinosa chosen as new chairman of the club. Espinoza won with a big margin of 77%.\n\nOn 2013 Matias Almeyda was appointed as the new manager of the club. He brought the team back to the top flight of the Argentinian league.\n\nThe stadium Florencio Sola was built in 1940 and is named after former President of the institution in the most glorious period in its history: Don Florencio \"Lencho\" Sola.\n\nTo celebrate its inauguration, a match took place against Independiente de Avellaneda which the team won 1–0 on a goal by Arsenio Erico. At this stage, the \"Drill\" played a record 39 matches unbeaten from 1950 to 1953. The stadium was considered advanced for its time because it was the first club of so-called \"medium\" to possess concrete grandstands, even before some of the big teams.\n\nIt is situated on the corner of Peña and Arenales in the city of Banfield. It recently opened a new area of two with silver trays, boxes, changing rooms and booths for radio and TV. The stadium holds 37,245 spectators. [1]\n\nA plan was put together to extend the stadium. The board of directors of the club, decide to approve the project and work began in 2011. The extension is to build a second tray on the podium Eliseo Mouriño and also perform a second tray in the visitor sector. Also to be added are rounded elbows and transmission towers. Therefore, the stadium's capacity would be 45,326 spectators.\n\nThe club's head office is located in Vergara 1635 (Banfield) and is the headquarters where athletes meet various activities. Also, here are held steering committee meetings.\n\nAt headquarters trainings are also held in other sports such as volleyball, futsal, skate, chess, children's football, gymnastics, taekwondo and the club has a training gym and a circle of lifetime partners, as well as a teamroom open to general public, where supporters gather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Banfield clubs affiliated to AFA (Argentine Football Association).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1822355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822355", "title": "Joe Nathan", "text": "Joe Nathan\n\nJoseph Michael Nathan (born November 22, 1974) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played 16 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants, Minnesota Twins, Texas Rangers, Detroit Tigers, and Chicago Cubs. Nathan started out his baseball career as a shortstop in high school and at Stony Brook University, but converted to a pitcher after being drafted by the Giants. He worked his way through the minor leagues, alternating between spots in the rotation and the bullpen. After a few years of splitting time between the major leagues and minor leagues, Nathan had a breakout season as a setup man for the Giants in 2003. That offseason, Nathan was traded to the Twins and became their closer.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2009, Nathan was considered one of the top closers in the major leagues, with four All-Star selections and a league-leading 246 saves. In 2010, Nathan underwent Tommy John surgery to repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his throwing elbow and missed the entire season. Nathan regained the role as closer in July 2011. On August 10, 2011, he became the Twins all-time leader in saves with his 255th in a game against the Boston Red Sox. After the 2011 season, Nathan left the Twins via free agency to sign with the Rangers, becoming an All-Star again in 2012 and 2013. On April 8, 2013, he earned his 300th save. After the 2013 season, Nathan left the Rangers via free agency to sign with the Tigers. Nathan retired during the 2017 season and is currently eighth on the all-time saves list. Nathan currently has the highest save percentage in MLB history amongst pitchers with at least 250 saves.\n\nNathan graduated from Pine Bush High School in Pine Bush, New York in 1992, where he played basketball and baseball and ran track. Only Division III colleges showed minimal interest in him, and he ended up at Stony Brook University largely because his high school assistant coach Jeff Masionet and Stony Brook baseball coach Matt Senk knew each other as former teammates in the State University of New York at Cortland baseball program.\n\nNathan first played shortstop for the then Division III Stony Brook Patriots (now Division I and called the Seawolves), at Stony Brook University on Long Island, New York. He also played for the Fairfield Stallions in the New England Collegiate Baseball League in 1994. Nathan became a two-time Academic All-American and graduated as a member of the Golden Key International Honour Society. During his tenure at Stony Brook, professional baseball scouts began to notice his good arm and pitcher's body. Senk arranged for a game in front of scouts, but on a day that \"literally someone from every organization\" came to watch him pitch, the game was rained out. The scouts had to settle for watching Nathan in a throwing session. He was drafted in the sixth round (159th overall) of the amateur draft by the San Francisco Giants in 1995, and signed the next day, June 2. In 2006, Nathan's number 22 was retired by Stony Brook, the first athlete to receive that honor from the school, and he was awarded the University Medal, the highest recognition given by Stony Brook. \n\nIn August 2008, he gave the Stony Brook athletics department $500,000 for a new baseball facility. In recognition of this \"lead gift\" from the Joe Nathan Charitable Foundation, the college named their baseball stadium Joe Nathan Field.\n\nHe began his minor league career in Class A for the Bellingham Giants. After an unsuccessful year at the plate the Giants tried to convert Nathan into a pitcher, but he refused and left to return to Stony Brook for a year, graduating with a degree in business management. He gave more thought to his future in baseball, however, and after graduation decided to return to the Giants organization and developed into a standout pitching prospect. After a season with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes, he pitched for both the A and AA levels for (the San Jose Giants and Shreveport Captains) in 1998 as a starter. During his tenure with San Jose he started 22 games with an ERA of 3.32 and 118 strikeouts, leading the Class A Giants to the California League championship. Promoted to AA Shreveport in 1999, he pitched in only two games before being promoted to the parent club in 1999.\n\nNathan was promoted to the San Francisco Giants on April 20, 1999, taking the roster spot of superstar slugger Barry Bonds, who went on the disabled list after left elbow surgery. He made his major league debut the next day, pitching seven shutout innings and winning his first major league decision against the Florida Marlins, 4–0. He then divided the rest of the season between the AAA Fresno Grizzlies and the Giants, going 6–4 with the Griz and 7–4 and 4.18 with the Giants, earning his first career save on May 16 against the Houston Astros.\n\nAfter a short stint in the minors in 2000, Nathan spent most of the season in the majors, finishing 5–2 and even hitting two home runs. But he struggled with his control, walking 63 in 93 innings and ending the season with a 5.21 ERA. He was on the disabled list twice: from May 17 to June 6 for right shoulder tendinitis and from July 14 to August 18 for an inflamed right shoulder, necessitating arthroscopic surgery on the afflicted shoulder at the end of the season. Nathan divided 2001 between the AAA Fresno Grizzlies and AA Shreveport both starting and relieving, finishing with a disappointing combined 3–11 record and an ERA over 7. Nathan improved slightly in 2002 to 6–12 with an ERA of over 5 at Fresno, but finally overcame his postsurgical struggles to return to the Giants in September with 3 scoreless innings in relief.\n\nNathan spent all of 2003 with the Giants in the bullpen after marrying Lisa Lemoncelli, his girlfriend of five years, in November 2002. This was a breakout year for Nathan, starting the season with 23 scoreless innings en route to a 12–4 record in his first full year as a reliever. His 78 appearances put him high on the list of most-used pitchers for the season as one of the best setup men in the NL, allowing no runs in 15 appearances from July 18 to August 20. His 12 wins in relief led the majors. The Giants won the National League West by 15 games and drew the Florida Marlins, the National League's wild card winner, in the NLDS. Nathan was hit hard in that series, blowing his only save opportunity. His team fared no better, winning Game 1 behind Jason Schmidt's complete game shutout before dropping the next three.\n\nNathan was traded to the Minnesota Twins on November 16, 2003. The Giants sent Nathan to the Twins along with pitchers Boof Bonser and Francisco Liriano for catcher A. J. Pierzynski and cash. The Twins decided to make Nathan their closer starting in 2004, risky move considering that Nathan had notched only one save in six opportunities as a Giant, but he won the job over J. C. Romero and Jesse Crain in spring training. He was signed to a three-year deal on March 4, 2004 and agreed to an incentive-laden contract with a base salary of $440,000. He started off the season strong, allowing no runs in 20 appearances and earning 14 saves from April 15 to June 4. He was named AL Co-Player of the Week starting on May 10 with four saves in four innings and four appearances, facing the minimum number of batters each time. His credentials for the first half of the season, 23 saves in 24 opportunities with a 1.19 ERA in 26 appearances, earned him his first All-Star appearance in the 2004 MLB All-Star Game. He was the only Twin on the squad and pitched a perfect seventh inning, getting Bobby Abreu to strike out, Mike Lowell to fly out and Miguel Cabrera to strike out. His numbers were impressive through the rest of the season, allowing no runs between June 9 and August 18, and between August 25 and September 16. and finishing 2004 with 44 saves in 47 opportunities and an ERA of 1.62. The Twins won the AL Central division and faced the New York Yankees in the ALDS. Nathan picked up his first postseason save in Game 1, but blew his second opportunity in Game 2 as the Twins went on to lose the ensuing three games. His outstanding season earned him MVP and Cy Young votes, finishing fourth for Cy Young and 12th for MVP. His first child, a son named Cole, was born on November 9, 2004.\n\nDuring spring training in 2005, Nathan signed a two-year deal that includes a club option for 2008. He picked up from where he left off in 2004, allowing no earned runs in 15 appearances from April 5 to May 10. He also had streaks of 13 and 12 consecutive save opportunities converted between April and July. As a result, Nathan was named the American League Player of the Week for the week of June 27. Nathan earned another All-Star appearance in 2005 for his pitching in the first half of the season. Although his record was 1–3 with a 3.57 ERA in 37 appearances, he had struck out 43 batters in 35 innings pitched, and lead the AL with 23 saves in 25 opportunities. Nathan pitched in the 2005 MLB All-Star Game alongside fellow pitcher Johan Santana. Pitching the eighth inning of the game, he got Morgan Ensberg to pop out for the first out, then gave out a double to Moisés Alou. Felipe López singled, and Nathan was able to get Miguel Cabrera and Luis Castillo out, but not before Alou scored. Nathan had a brilliant second half as he went 6–1 with 18 saves in 20 chances, and posted an ERA of 1.76. He finished the season with a 7–4 record, a 2.70 ERA, 43 saves in 48 opportunities, and 94 strikeouts. Nathan also became the third pitcher in club history to post consecutive 40 save seasons. The Twins however missed the playoffs.\n\nBefore the 2006 season began, Nathan participated in the 2006 World Baseball Classic as one of the 30 players selected for the Team USA roster. He played the first game, a 2–0 win against Mexico, striking out the side while allowing one hit. He also pitched the 4–3 victory against Japan, again throwing a shutout inning. Nathan went on to pitch the last game for the United States in the ninth inning against Mexico, again not allowing a run and striking out two.\n\nAs the regular 2006 season began for the Twins, Nathan started off strong, allowing no runs from the start of the season to April 25. He also converted 10 straight save opportunities from April 11 to June 17. On June 24, Nathan recorded his one hundredth career save against the Chicago Cubs, and 99th save with Minnesota. Four days later he got save number 101, his hundredth save with Minnesota against the Los Angeles Dodgers, becoming the fifth pitcher in Twins history to achieve that mark. Despite putting up great numbers during the 2006 season, Nathan was not selected to the All-Star Game. He continued to pitch well throughout the season, passing Eddie Guardado for second on the Twins' all-time save list when he earned his 117th save against the Detroit Tigers on September 9. Nathan was also given the Major League Baseball Delivery Man of the Month award for July, going nine for nine in save opportunities and posting a 0.75 ERA for the month. He finished the season with some of his best numbers to date: a 7–0 record, a 1.58 ERA, 95 strikeouts, 36 saves, an 18th-place finish in MVP voting, and a fifth-place finish in Cy Young voting. His 61 games finished were also good for the AL lead and opponents batted just .158 against him, a career high. With 36 saves in 38 opportunities, Nathan also became the first pitcher for the organization to earn 35 saves in three straight seasons. The Twins won the division on the last day of the regular season, but were swept by the Oakland Athletics in the ALDS as Nathan made one scoreless appearance.\n\nNathan continued as the Twins' closer for the 2007 season. He had a stretch between July and August where he gave up just two earned runs and converted all 12 save chances. Once again despite Nathan's numbers, he was not picked for the All-Star team. Nathan finished the year by converting 37 of 41 save opportunities with a record of 4–2 and an ERA of 1.88. The Twins, however, had a disappointing season and missed the playoffs.\n\nOn September 25, 2007, Nathan was named as one of 10 finalists for the \"DHL Delivery Man of the Year Award\", the third year in a row that he has been a finalist. On October 29, the Twins exercised Nathan's club option for 2008.\n\nThough Nathan was slated to make $6 million in 2008, on March 24, 2008, the Minnesota Twins re-signed Nathan to a four-year, $47 million contract through 2011. The deal also includes a $12.5 million club option for 2012 with a $2 million buyout.\n\nNathan started the season with 13 consecutive saves but blew his first save of the season on May 27 by giving up a three-run inside-the-park home run on a misplayed fly ball by teammate Delmon Young; however, Nathan got two outs to end the 9th inning and the Twins went on to win the game. By converting 27 of 29 save opportunities prior to the All-Star break, Nathan was selected as a reserve player for the American League in the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Nathan finished the year with 39 saves and a career best 1.33 ERA. He also had a career high six blown saves and surrendered his first career walk-off home run to Victor Martinez on September 16. Nathan ranked seventh in the majors in saves and had the lowest ERA of the top 30 save leaders in 2008.\n\nNathan had a strong season, as he was selected as an All-Star for the 2009 MLB All Star Game, and he finished the year with 2.10 ERA with 47 saves in 52 opportunities, which was a franchise record. He shared honors for the AL Rolaids Relief Man award with Mariano Rivera. However, Nathan did not fare as well in the postseason; in Game 2 of the American League Division Series against the New York Yankees, with the Twins leading 3–1 in the bottom of the ninth inning, Nathan blew the save when he surrendered a game-tying two-run home run to Alex Rodriguez. It was the first home run Nathan had allowed with men on base all year. The Yankees later won the game in the 11th inning and swept the series. On October 11, 2009, after the Twins lost the final game at the Metrodome (a 4–1 playoff loss to the Yankees that eliminated them), Nathan took a pile of dirt from the mound as a keepsake from the Metrodome.\n\nOn March 9, 2010, it was reported that Nathan had a tear in his ulnar collateral ligament. On March 21, after attempting to pitch without having surgery, Nathan decided to undergo Tommy John surgery, missing the entire 2010 season.\n\nNathan earned his first save at Target Field on April 8, 2011. He emptied the container of dirt he took from the Metrodome on the mound at Target Field before pitching. On April 18, Nathan was replaced at closer by Matt Capps after going 3 for 5 in save opportunities. On May 28, 2011, Nathan was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a right flexor muscle strain. Chuck James was called up to take his place.\n\nOn August 10, 2011, against the Boston Red Sox, Nathan became the Twins all-time saves leader with 255, passing Rick Aguilera.\n\nAfter the Twins declined his $12.5 million club option and exercised a $2 million buyout, Nathan became a free agent at the end of the 2011 season.\n\nNathan is currently the Minnesota Twins leader in career saves, with 260.\n\nOn November 21, 2011, Nathan agreed to terms on a two-year deal with the Texas Rangers worth $14.5 million guaranteed with an option for a third year at $9 million or a $500,000 buyout.\n\nNathan had a strong first season with the Rangers, as he was selected to the represent the Rangers at the 2012 MLB All Star Game, the fifth all star selection of his career. He finished his 2012 campaign with 37 saves and an ERA of 2.80. During a game against the Tampa Bay Rays on April 8, 2013, Nathan earned his 300th career save after striking out Ben Zobrist looking on a controversial strike call made by home plate umpire Marty Foster. TV cameras captured Nathan saying \"Wow!\" after the call.\n\nNathan was selected to his sixth All Star Game in 2013, and earned the save for the American League. Nathan improved on his 2012 campaign, finishing his 2013 season with 43 saves and an ERA of 1.39. Nathan finished his Rangers career with an overall record of 9–7, 80 saves, a 2.08 ERA and 0.98 WHIP.\n\nOn December 4, 2013, the Tigers signed Nathan to a two-year, $20 million contract, with a club option for 2016. This reunited him with former teammate and fellow ex-Twins great, Torii Hunter along with Rangers teammate Ian Kinsler. On May 5, 2014, Nathan recorded his 347th career save, tying him with Randy Myers for ninth on the all-time saves list. Two days later, Nathan recorded career save number 348, putting him alone at ninth on the all-time saves list. On June 9, Nathan recorded career save 358, tying him with Troy Percival for 8th on the all-time saves list. On August 23, 2014, Nathan recorded his 368th career save, passing up Jeff Reardon for 7th place on the all-time saves list. In a September 16 game against the Minnesota Twins, Nathan blew his seventh save of the season, surpassing his previous career high of six blown saves when he pitched for the Twins in 2008. Nathan finished his first season with the Tigers making 62 appearances and recording 35 saves in 42 chances, while posting an ERA of 4.81. He made one postseason appearance in 2014, retiring all three batters he faced in a non-save situation in Game 2 of the ALDS against the Baltimore Orioles. The Tigers were swept in the series, 3–0.\n\nOn April 8, 2015, Nathan was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a strained right elbow. During a rehab start with the Toledo Mud Hens on April 22, Nathan re-injured his elbow after throwing only 10 pitches. The same night, Nathan underwent MRIs, which tested positive revealing tears in his ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow and his pronator teres muscle, and would undergo Tommy John surgery, ending Nathan's 2015 season. Sources projected that this surgery could end Nathan's career, but he was not planning to retire yet.\n\nDuring the 2015 offseason, the Tigers declined the $10 million club option for Nathan for the 2016 season, and exercised a $1 million buyout.\n\nOn May 17, 2016, Nathan signed with the Chicago Cubs. He was immediately placed on the 60-day disabled list upon signing to continue recovery from his previous Tommy John surgery. He made his Cubs debut on July 24, 2016 against the Milwaukee Brewers, pitching one inning and striking out three while allowing one hit and one walk. After three appearances, the Cubs designated Nathan for assignment on August 6, 2016. The Cubs went on to win the World Series that year, earning Nathan his first World Series ring.\n\nOn August 16, 2016, Nathan signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants. On September 3, Nathan was called up from the Richmond Flying Squirrels to the Giants expanded September roster.\n\nNathan signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Washington Nationals for the 2017 season. He opted out of his contract and was released on March 27, 2017, as spring training came to a close. He was re-signed to a minor league contract on April 10, and released for a second time on May 31.\n\nOn September 3, 2017, Nathan held a press conference with the Minnesota Twins, where he announced his retirement after signing a one-day contract to end his career in Minnesota. Nathan threw out the first pitch during that night's game against the Kansas City Royals. Nathan retired with 377 saves, at the time eighth-most in MLB history, a 2.87 ERA, and an 89.3% save percentage, the highest amongst all relievers with at least 250 saves.\n\nNathan was inducted into the Twins Hall of Fame on August 3, 2019.\n\nHe and his ex-wife, Lisa, have two children, Cole and Riley. Nathan's foundation, Joe Nathan Charitable Foundation, also called \"Save It\", helps raise money and awareness for many different charities.\n\nNathan threw a mix of four pitches. His main pitch, a four-seam fastball was once thrown in the mid-to-upper 90s, but settled between 91 and 94 mph. His main breaking ball was a hard slider in the upper 80s, occasionally even touching 90. He used the slider less frequently against left-handed hitters, preferring to use a curveball in the low 80s.

It was first aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 11, 1999. In this episode, Homer inadvertently becomes a well-praised outsider artist after his failed attempts to build a barbecue pit. His exhibit goes to the Louvre, and after Mr. Burns buys his artwork, Homer becomes a success. However, after his new art appears in the \"Art in America\" show, Homer's artwork is criticized for being too repetitive of his first piece. After his recent failure, Homer tries to devise something groundbreaking, after hearing of Christo's art.\n\n\"Mom and Pop Art\" was directed by Steven Dean Moore and was the first episode Al Jean wrote after his return to \"The Simpsons\" writing staff. The plot was conceived by Jean, who was inspired by a segment about found artists on the television news magazine \"60 Minutes\". The episode features contemporary artist Jasper Johns as himself, and also features Italian actress Isabella Rossellini as Astrid Weller. It references several famous artworks, such as those of Leonardo da Vinci and Henri Rousseau. \n\nIn its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 8.5 million viewers, finishing in 23rd place in the ratings the week it aired. \n\nFollowing the home video release of \"The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season\", \"Mom and Pop Art\" received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nHomer is relaxing on a Saturday when Marge tells him that he should be doing work around the house and yard. Homer overcomes his reluctance and takes Bart to Mom & Pop Hardware to get some equipment. But while there, Homer sees a do it yourself barbecue pit and is compelled to buy it instead of anything that might help him with his work. Homer tries to install the pit, but bungles the job when he drops the parts of the barbecue into wet cement. He frantically tries to assemble the barbecue pit before the cement hardens, but only makes things worse. In the end, Homer is left with a mismatched collection of parts stuck in hardened cement, which angers him. He vents his rage on the construct, mangling it further. Later, Homer takes the results of his work back to the store for a refund, which he does not receive. On the way home, Homer loses control of the wagon containing the jumbled mess of concrete and bricks. It rolls down the highway and crashes into a woman's car, wrecking it. Homer flees the scene of the accident, but the woman tracks him down. It turns out that she is an artist named Astrid Weller (voiced by Isabella Rossellini), and sees Homer's handiwork as being a masterpiece of outsider art. Homer's exhibit goes to the Louvre: American Style museum and when Mr. Burns buys his work, Homer becomes a success.\n\nNow officially an outsider artist, Homer uses his channeled rage to continue his work and befriends other pop art artists, like Jasper Johns. All the while, his easily achieved fame makes Marge jealous due to her lack of success at becoming a successful artist despite years of effort. Homer later gets a notice from Astrid Weller that his work will be in the \"Art in America\" show, but his new masterpieces are rejected by Springfield's residents and his new \"friends\" for being repetitive of his first piece.\n\nDown on his luck and starved for inspiration, Lisa recommends Homer visit the Springfield Art Museum. But none of the art Homer sees serves to inspire him; he feels inadequate when he sees what other artists have done, and it only worsens the situation when he takes a nap and has a nightmare of various paintings attacking him. He goes back home, discouraged, but is soon given another suggestion by Lisa. She tells him about the artist Christo, causing Homer to try doing something similarly groundbreaking. He and Bart flood Springfield by opening all the fire hydrants (having covered the sewer drains with the city's doormats, including their own) and putting snorkels in the animals of the zoo (so that they do not drown). Surprisingly, Astrid Weller and even the whole town of Springfield is impressed with Homer's work, and enjoy the newly made \"Grand Canals of Springfield\" along with the swimming zoo animals. As Marge and Homer kiss each other on the roof of their house Jasper Johns comes on a boat and steals the painting Marge was painting. The song playing in the end of episode is \"Arrivederci Roma\" performed by Michael Dees.\n\n\"Mom and Pop Art\" was written by current showrunner Al Jean and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April 11, 1999. It was the first episode Jean wrote after returning to \"The Simpsons\" writing staff. For three years, Jean had worked with Mike Reiss on the fantasy sitcom \"Teen Angel\", a job that he despised. \"Every other day [that I worked on \"Teen Angel\"] I said 'I wish I was back at \"The Simpsons\"',\" Jean said in the DVD commentary for the episode. The idea for the episode came from a segment of the television news magazine \"60 Minutes\". The segment was about found artists, who, Jean said, \"take basically garbage and assemble it[...] and turn it into artwork that would sell for tens of thousands of dollars.\" Jean thought that this profession would fit Homer. In the episode, \"Start here tomorrow 7/17/95\" is written in blue paint on the Simpsons' garage door. The date refers to Scully and Julie Thacker's anniversary, which was on July 17, 1995. In the episode's setpiece, the Simpsons visit a hardware store. The segment was inspired by Jean's father, who owned a hardware store that Al Jean used to work in as a child. Later in the setpiece, Homer tries to construct a barbecue that he bought from the hardware store. The scene was also conceived by Jean, and is executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully's favorite setpiece.\n\nWhile the designs of Homer's new art friends were not based on anybody in particular, the \"German guy\" was drawn to hold his cigarette in a \"European way\" by animation director Jim Reardon. When visiting the Springfield museum, Homer and Marge see a painting showing Akbar and Jeff, two characters from \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening's comic strip \"Life in Hell\". The painting's frame was also signed by Groening himself in real life. The painting next to Groening's was drawn by Scully's friend Tom Gagnon, who is an artist. Some of the paintings in the episode's second act were also drawn by friends of Dean Moore. At one point in Homer's dream, the Vitruvian Man appears and attacks him. According to Groening, there were \"some controversy\" over whether or not the Vitruvian Man would be in nude or not, as he is in the original painting. In the episode, he is wearing a jockstrap. At the end of the episode, Springfield is flooded with water, and Marge is seen painting a picture on the Simpsons' roof. Her painting was drawn by staff animator Amy Clese, who drew it as a recreation of a painting by J. M. W. Turner, an English Romantic painter. According to Dean Moore, the painting was \"pretty difficult\" to animate, as it was drawn with a lot of washes and gradients. He added, however, that he was \"very happy\" with it.\n\n\"Mom and Pop Art\" features American contemporary artist Jasper Johns as himself. His lines were recorded over the telephone, and Jean stated that it was \"extremely exciting\" to have him appear in the episode. The episode also features Italian actress Isabella Rossellini as Astrid. Jean stated that her performance was \"terrific\" and that she was \"wonderful to work with\", although there was one line in particular that she had difficulty performing. In a scene in the episode, Astrid introduces the audience in an art club to Homer's art. Originally, she would have said \"you snorted my father's ashes\", but because of Rossellini's accent, it sounded like she said \"you snorted my father's ass\", according to Jean. Because none of the recorded takes sounded good, the line was ultimately scrapped from the episode.\n\n\"Mom and Pop Art\" features several references to famous works of art. In Homer's dream, Homer is lying in a similar way to the woman in French Naïve artist Henri Rousseau's painting \"The Sleeping Gypsy\", as is the lion that licks him. After he is waken up by the lion, Homer is attacked by the Vitruvian Man, a drawing by Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci. Then Homer gets attacked by Three Musicians by Pablo Picasso in which their instruments turn into machine guns and shoot at Homer. At one point in his dream, Homer sees a clock that drips water. The scene is a reference to \"The Persistence of Memory\", a painting by Spanish Catalan surrealist artist Salvador Dalí. Near the end of his dream, Homer meets American painter Andy Warhol, who throws soup cans at him. It is a reference to \"Campbell's Soup Cans\", a painting by Warhol.\n\nAlso, Johns is portrayed as a kleptomaniac, a person who compulsively steals objects of little to no value. It is a reference to Johns's art style, as he usually uses objects from everyday life for his artwork. In a scene in the episode, Homer channels his anger into his art. The scene is a reference to the 1959 comedy horror film \"A Bucket of Blood\", in which an artist is screaming at a piece of clay to be a nose. After having flooded Springfield, Homer tells Marge that the city is \"like Venice, without the black plague\". The line refers to the outbreak of the bubonic plague that swept through Europe in the 14th century. In the scene, a lion can be seen swimming in the water. The notion that lions can swim is a reference to the season 2 episode \"Bart the Daredevil\", in which the famous daredevil Lance Murdock performs a stunt that involves swimming lions.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on April 11, 1999, \"Mom and Pop Art\" received an 8.5 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 8.5 million viewers. The episode finished in 23rd place in the ratings for the week of April 5–11, 1999, making it the fourth-most watched program on Fox that night, after a new episode of \"The X-Files\", \"Ally McBeal\", and \"Family Guy\". On August 7, 2007, the episode was released as part of \"The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD box set. Matt Groening, Mike Scully, Al Jean, George Meyer and Steven Dean Moore participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode.\n\nFollowing its home video release, \"Mom and Pop Art\" received mixed reviews from critics. \n\nGiving it a positive review, Chris Barsanti of Filmcritic.com described it as \"one of the show's most gratifying ep[isode]s\". He wrote \"Amidst Homer's accidental acceptance as a producer of rage-filled outsider art, the episode concocts a knowing satire—but also warm appreciation—of modern art,\" and added that it \"includes one of the show's best cameos of all time: a kleptomaniacal Jasper Johns.\" \n\nBoth James Plath of DVD Town and Jake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News considered it to be one of the season's best episodes. \n\n\"The A.V. Club\" named Milhouse's line \"Everything's coming up Milhouse!\" as one of the quotes from \"The Simpsons\" that can be used in everyday situations. \n\nGiving the episode a mixed review, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson described it as \"pretty average.\" He wrote that \"Mom and Pop Art\" \"offer[s] more than a few elements that echo bits from earlier years\". He concluded by writing that the episode \"isn’t a bad program, but it lacks much inspiration\". \n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\" wrote, \"Well, Marge is justifiably upset when, as an artist herself, it is Homer who is suddenly getting the kudos for producing rubbish. It's a good gag but probably not enough to stretch out for an entire episode.\" However, they added that the last scenes, along with Johns's cameo, were \"pure joy\", even though the episode \"drag[s] in the middle\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1822395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822395", "title": "Thermodynamic versus kinetic reaction control", "text": "Thermodynamic versus kinetic reaction control\n\nThermodynamic reaction control or kinetic reaction control in a chemical reaction can decide the composition in a reaction product mixture when competing pathways lead to different products and the reaction conditions influence the selectivity or stereoselectivity. The distinction is relevant when product A forms faster than product B because the activation energy for product A is lower than that for product B, yet product B is more stable. In such a case A is the kinetic product and is favoured under kinetic control and B is the thermodynamic product and is favoured under thermodynamic control.\n\nThe conditions of the reaction, such as temperature, pressure, or solvent, affect which reaction pathway may be favored: either the kinetically controlled or the thermodynamically controlled one. Note this is only true if the activation energy of the two pathways differ, with one pathway having a lower \"E\" (energy of activation) than the other.\n\nPrevalence of thermodynamic or kinetic control determines the final composition of the product when these competing reaction pathways lead to different products. The reaction conditions as mentioned above influence the selectivity of the reaction - i.e., which pathway is taken.\n\nAsymmetric synthesis is a field in which the distinction between kinetic and thermodynamic control is especially important. Because pairs of enantiomers have, for all intents and purposes, the same Gibbs free energy, thermodynamic control will produce a racemic mixture by necessity. Thus, any \"catalytic\" reaction that provides product with nonzero enantiomeric excess is under at least partial kinetic control. (In many \"stoichiometric\" asymmetric transformations, the enantiomeric products are actually formed as a complex with the chirality source before the workup stage of the reaction, technically making the reaction a diastereoselective one. Although such reactions are still usually kinetically controlled, thermodynamic control is at least possible, in principle.)\n\nThe Diels–Alder reaction of cyclopentadiene with furan can produce two isomeric products. At room temperature, kinetic reaction control prevails and the less stable endo isomer 2 is the main reaction product. At 81 °C and after long reaction times, the chemical equilibrium can assert itself and the thermodynamically more stable exo isomer 1 is formed. The \"exo\" product is more stable by virtue of a lower degree of steric congestion, while the \"endo\" product is favoured by orbital overlap in the transition state. \nAn outstanding and very rare example of the \"full\" kinetic and thermodynamic reaction control in the process of the tandem inter-/intramolecular Diels–Alder reaction of bis-furyl dienes 3 with hexafluoro-2-butyne or dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) have been discovered and described in 2018. At low temperature, the reactions occur chemoselectively leading exclusively to adducts of pincer-[4+2] cycloaddition (5). The exclusive formation of domino-adducts (6) is observed at elevated temperatures.\n\nTheoretical DFT calculations of the reaction between hexafluoro-2-butyne and dienes 3a-c were performed. The reaction starting with [4+2] cycloaddition of CFC≡CCF at one of the furan moieties occurs in a concerted fashion \"via\" TS1 and represents the rate limiting step of the whole process with the activation barrier Δ\"G\"≈ 23.1–26.8 kcal/mol.\n\nFurther, the reaction could proceed \"via\" two competing channels, \"i.e.\" either leading to the pincer type products 5 \"via\" TS2k or resulting in the formation of the domino product 6 \"via\" TS2t. The calculations showed that the first channel is more kinetically favourable (Δ\"G\"≈ 5.7–5.9 kcal/mol). Meanwhile, the domino products 6 are more thermodynamically stable than 5 (Δ\"G\"≈ 4.2-4.7 kcal/mol) and this fact may cause isomerization of 5 into 6 at elevated temperature. Indeed, the calculated activation barriers for the 5 → 6 isomerization \"via\" the retro-Diels–Alder reaction of 5 followed by the intramolecular [4+2]-cycloaddition in the chain intermediate 4 to give 6 are 34.0–34.4 kcal/mol.\n\nIn the protonation of an enolate ion, the kinetic product is the enol and the thermodynamic product is a ketone or aldehyde. Carbonyl compounds and their enols interchange rapidly by proton transfers catalyzed by acids or bases, even in trace amounts, in this case mediated by the enolate or the proton source.\n\nIn the deprotonation of an unsymmetrical ketone, the kinetic product is the enolate resulting from removal of the most accessible α-H while the thermodynamic product has the more highly substituted enolate moiety. Use of low temperatures and sterically demanding bases increases the kinetic selectivity. Here, the difference in p\"K\" between the base and the enolate is so large that the reaction is essentially irreversible, so the equilibration leading to the thermodynamic product is likely a proton exchange occurring during the addition between the kinetic enolate and as-yet-unreacted ketone. An inverse addition (adding ketone to the base) with rapid mixing would minimize this. The position of the equilibrium will depend on the countercation and solvent.\n\nIf a much weaker base is used, the deprotonation will be incomplete, and there will be an equilibrium between reactants and products. Thermodynamic control is obtained, however the reaction remains incomplete unless the product enolate is trapped, as in the example below. Since H transfers are very fast, the trapping reaction being slower, the ratio of trapped products largely mirrors the deprotonation equilibrium.\nThe electrophilic addition reaction of hydrogen bromide to 1,3-butadiene above room temperature leads predominantly to the thermodynamically more stable 1,4 adduct, 1-bromo-2-butene, but decreasing the reaction temperature to below room temperature favours the kinetic 1,2 adduct, 3-bromo-1-butene.\n\n\n\n\nThe first to report on the relationship between kinetic and thermodynamic control were R.B. Woodward and Harold Baer in 1944. They were re-investigating a reaction between maleic anhydride and a fulvene first reported in 1929 by Otto Diels and Kurt Alder. They observed that \"while the endo isomer is formed more rapidly, longer reaction times, as well as relatively elevated temperatures, result in higher exo / endo ratios\" which had to be \" considered in the light of the remarkable stability of the exo-compound on the one hand and the very facile dissociation of the endo isomer on the other.\"\nC. K. Ingold with E. D. Hughes and G. Catchpole independently described a thermodynamic and kinetic reaction control model in 1948. They were reinvestigating a certain allylic rearrangement reported in 1930 by Jakob Meisenheimer. Solvolysis of gamma-phenylallyl chloride with AcOK in acetic acid was found to give a mixture of the gamma and the alpha acetate with the latter converting to the first by equilibration. This was interpreted as a \"case in the field of anionotropy of the phenomenon, familiar in prototropy, of the distinction between kinetic and thermodynamic control in ion-recombination\".\n"}
{"id": "1822398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822398", "title": "Disco Duck", "text": "Disco Duck\n\n\"Disco Duck\" is a satirical disco novelty song performed by Rick Dees and His Cast of Idiots. At the time, Dees was a Memphis disc jockey. It became a number-one hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for one week in October 1976 (and ranked #97 out of the 100 most popular songs of the year according to \"Billboard\" magazine). It also made the top 20 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Soul Singles chart, peaking at number 15. \"Disco Duck\" was initially released in the south by Estelle Axton's Fretone label, but it was later released by RSO Records for national and international distribution. The song earned a 1977 People's Choice Award for Favorite New Song.\n\nWritten by Dees, \"Disco Duck\" was inspired by a 1960s novelty dance song called \"The Duck\", recorded by Jackie Lee (Earl Lee Nelson) in 1965. According to Dees, it took one day to write the song, but three months to convince anyone to perform it.\n\nCombining orchestral disco styles with a Donald Duck-esque voice as the main plot point, the story within \"Disco Duck\" centers around a man at a dance party who is overcome by the urge to get up and \"get down\" in a duck-like manner. When the music stops, he sits down, but when he decides to get up and dance again, he finds that everyone in the room is now doing his dance.\n\nA misconception about \"Disco Duck\" is that the voice of the duck itself was provided by Clarence Nash, the original voice of Donald Duck in many Walt Disney cartoons, but on several occasions the Disney Company maintained that Nash never contributed to the record. The voice of the duck was performed by Ken Pruitt, an acquaintance of Dees, as stated on the label of the RSO release. For the live tour, the duck vocals were handled by Michael Chesney, another acquaintance of Dees.\n\nIn fact, the voice emulates that of Yakky Doodle, a Hanna Barbera animated duck who appeared on TV in 1960 and 1961 and was still seen regularly on afternoon TV cartoon shows in the late 1970s. He even parodies Yakky's signature phrase, \"Are you my mama?\", saying \"I've got to have me a mama!\".\n\n\"Disco Duck\" became a nationwide hit in the United States by September 1976. On the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart, it peaked at number one on October 16, 1976, for one week, held the number-two spot for the following four weeks and remained in the Top 10 for a total of 10 weeks.\n\nFor all its success, \"Disco Duck\" was banned by radio stations in Memphis, where Dees was living, including WMPS-AM, the station Dees worked for at the time. Station management forbade Dees to play the record on his own show and rival stations in the city refused to play it for fear of promoting the competition. When Dees talked about (but did not play) the song on his show one morning, his boss fired him citing conflict of interest. After a brief mandatory hiatus, Dees was hired by Memphis station WHBQ-AM, which was WMPS's primary competitor.\n\nBy the time \"Disco Duck\" had become a hit, Dees and his \"Idiots\" started making the rounds of the popular TV music shows to promote the record. On \"American Bandstand\" (and similar shows), Dees lip-synched to the recording, alone on stage with puppeteer Rickey Provow animating a duck puppet that he had made. This appearance was never seen in the Memphis area due to then-ABC affiliate WHBQ-TV pre-empting \"Bandstand\" for wrestling at the time and for the aforementioned Memphis radio avoidance reasons. But when Dees appeared on \"The Midnight Special\" and went on a live tour along the East Coast, he hired a band, backing singers and a commercial artist, Michael Chesney, to perform the duck vocals, and they did everything live.\n\n\"Disco Duck\" even made an appearance in the film \"Saturday Night Fever\", in a dance club scene in which a group of senior citizens were learning to dance disco-style. It was also featured in a deleted scene added to the PG rated version. As it stands, Dees could have made an even more substantial amount of money from the song. According to Dees, his manager at the time made the extremely unwise decision to deny use of the song on the film's soundtrack album because of fears that it would compete with sales of Dees's own record. The \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack has now currently sold 40 million copies worldwide, and is the second best-selling soundtrack of all time.\n\nIrwin the Disco Duck, also called Irwin the Dynamic Duck, a fictional character who was featured on a series of children's records from Peter Pan Records, was inspired by this record.\n"}

Today, what was once NBD is owned by JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nNBD was founded in 1933 in Detroit in the midst of widespread bank failures during the Great Depression. Spurred by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) to help stabilize the nation's banking system, NBD's shares were initially equally owned by General Motors (GM) and by the U.S. government under the RFC.

As of March 2006, most former NBD branches carry the Chase name.\n\nNBD had branches in Toronto and Windsor, Ontario, and overseas in London's Finsbury Circus, in Tokyo, and in Frankfurt.\n\nFrom 1959 until 1995, NBD was headquartered in the National Bank of Detroit Building (now The Qube).\n\nUp until the 1970s, retail banks located within the state of Michigan were restricted to building branches within their home counties, but could have a branch office outside their home county only if that branch was located within a 25-mile radius of their main offices. Starting in 1972, the state legislature began to allow the formation of multibank holding companies. To take advantage of this new law, the National Bank of Detroit formed the National Detroit Corporation on January 1, 1973 as its holding company. The holding company began to offer stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticket symbol NBD. National Detroit Corp. was later renamed NBD Bancorp in 1981.\n\nIn November 1974, National Detroit Corporation made its first acquisitions outside the Detroit area by the acquisition of the Grand Valley National Bank in Grandville for $3.4 million.

The acquisition was finalized in May 1986 at a cost of $61 million in stock.\n\nIn June 1991, NBD Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Merrillville-based Gainer Bank for $134 million in stock. The acquisition was completed in the following January.\n\nIn December 1991, NBD Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of Fort Wayne-based Summcorp, the holding company for Summit Bank and four other banks.

The acquisition was completed a year later and USAmeribancs was renamed NBD Illinois Inc. and each of the banks were renamed NBD followed by the name of the geographical area in which each of the banks were located.\n\nIn June 1987, NBD Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the State National Corp. of Evanston for $103 million in cash and stock.\n\nIn March 1988, NBD Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Charter Bank Group Inc. of Northfield for $65 million in stock and completed in September.\n\nIn March 1991, NBD Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Mount Prospect-based FNW Bancorp. with its 17 banks for $205 million in stock.\n\nIn March 1994, NBD Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Joliet-based Amerifed Financial Corporation, the holding company for the AmeriFed Federal Savings Bank, with its 10 offices for $149 million in stock. When the acquisition was completed, NBD had 51 offices in Illinois and 630 offices in Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, and Florida.\n\nIn January 1995, NBD Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Deerfield-based Deerbank Corporation, the holding company for the Deerfield Federal Savings and Loan Association, with its 15 offices for $120 million in stock. The acquisition was completed in July. After the completion of the acquisition, NBD became the sixth largest bank in Illinois and also the largest bank in many counties in the suburban Chicago-area, but not in Chicago itself.\n\nNBD Bancorp had a presence in state of Florida since 1982 when it established the NBD Trust Company of Florida, N.A. in West Palm Beach. The trust company later moved to North Palm Beach.\n\nIn June 1990, NBD Bancorp acquired the assets and offices of the failed Venice-based First Venice Savings & Loan Association from the Resolution Trust Corporation and formed a federal savings bank called NBD Bank, FSB.\n\nIn October 1991, NBD Bancorp acquired the Boca Raton-based First Fidelity Trust and merged the company into the North Palm Beach-based NBD Trust Company of Florida, N.A.\n\nIn December 1990, NBD Bancorp entered Ohio by acquiring the assets and the 21 offices of the failed Columbus-based Mid-America Federal Savings and Loan from the Resolution Trust Corporation for $48 million and converted them into full service banks. The insolvent S&L had 13 offices in Columbus and eight in Dayton. The new Ohio bank that was created to handle this acquisition was called NBD Ohio, Inc.\n\nAfter increasing the number of offices in Columbus from 13 to 17 while the number of offices in Dayton had remained at 8, NBD decided to leave the state of Ohio by selling all of the assets and offices of NBD Ohio to Fifth Third Bank in October 1995 for an undisclosed amount. The divestiture was finalized in February 1996 for $52 million.\n\nOn July 12, 1995, First Chicago Corporation and NBD Bancorp Inc. announced that the two companies were planning to merge by swapping that was worth $5.3 billion. As part of the deal, First Chicago shareholders would own 50.1 percent of the combined company, while NBD shareholders would own 49.9 percent. Richard L. Thomas, chairman and chief executive of First Chicago, would be chairman of the combined company until May 20, 1996, when he plans to resign. Verne G. Istock, chairman of NBD, would be president and chief executive of the combined company until Thomas steps down and replace Thomas as chairman of the combined company.\n\nThe merger was finalized on December 1, 1995.\n\nMost customers did not see much of a change as a result of the merger except in suburban Chicago where there was branch overlap. This problem was resolved by the closing of 15 former NBD and 9 former First Chicago offices and the rebranding of the remaining NBD offices to the First Chicago brand. Outside of Illinois, NBD branches were left unaffected.\n\nIn February 1996, First Chicago NBD sold all of their NBD offices in Ohio to Fifth Third Bancorp.\n\n"}

Originally a convict deported to Australia, she was viewed by her contemporaries as a role model of success and became legendary as a successful businesswoman in the colony.\n\nReibey baptised Molly Haydock, was born on 12 May 1777 in Bury, Lancashire, England. She was a businesswoman and trader. Following the death of her parents, she was reared by a grandmother and sent into service. She ran away, and was arrested for stealing a horse in August 1791.\nAt the time, she was disguised as a boy and was going under the name of James Burrow. Sentenced to seven years' transportation, she arrived in Sydney, Australia, on the \"Royal Admiral\" in October 1792.\n\nOn 7 September 1794, 17-year-old Mary married Thomas Reibey, after he had proposed to her several times; she finally agreed to marry the junior officer on the store ship \"Britannia\". Reibey also used the surnames Raiby, Reiby and Reibey interchangeably, but the family adopted the spelling Reibey in later years. Thomas Reibey was granted land on the Hawkesbury River, where he and Mary lived and farmed following their marriage. They built a farmhouse called Reibycroft, which is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.\n\nThomas Reibey commenced a cargo business along the Hawkesbury River to Sydney and later moved to Sydney. Thomas Reibey's business undertakings prospered, enabling him in 1804 to build a substantial stone residence on a further grant of land near Macquarie Place. He acquired several farms on the Hawkesbury River and traded in coal, cedar, furs and skins. He entered into a partnership with Edward Wills, and trading activities were extended to the Bass Strait, the Pacific Islands and, from 1809 to China and India.\n\nWhen Thomas Reibey died on 5 April 1811, Mary assumed sole responsibility for the care of seven children and the control of numerous business enterprises. She was no stranger to this task, having managed her husband's affairs during his frequent absences from Sydney. Now a woman of considerable wealth by her husband's businesses, Reibey continued to expand her business interests. In 1812 she opened a new warehouse in George Street and in 1817 extended her shipping operations with the purchase of further vessels. In the same year, the Bank of New South Wales was founded in her house in Macquarie Place.\n\nBy 1828, when she gradually retired from active involvement in commerce, she had acquired extensive property holdings in the city. Like many others, however, she was on occasions somewhat economical with the truth. In March 1820 she had returned to England with her daughters to visit her native village, and came back to Sydney the next year. So in the 1828 census, when asked to describe her condition, she declared that she \"came free in 1821\".\n\nIn the emancipist Society of New South Wales, she gained respect for her charitable works and her interest in the church and education. She was appointed one of the Governors of the Free Grammar School in 1825.\n\nReibey built a cottage in the suburb of Hunters Hill, New South Wales circa 1836, where she lived for some time. The cottage, situated on the shores of the Lane Cove River, was later acquired by the Joubert brothers, who enlarged it. It is now known as Fig Tree House and is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.\n\nOn her retirement, she built a house at Newtown, Sydney, where she lived until her death on 30 May 1855 from pneumonia. She was 78 years old.\n\nAn enterprising and determined person of strong personality, during her lifetime Reibey earned a reputation as an astute and successful business woman in the colony of New South Wales. She is featured on the obverse of Australian twenty-dollar notes printed since 1994.\n\nThe oldest son of Mary and Thomas Reibey, Thomas Haydock Reibey II (1821-1912: clergyman, farmer and politician), later became the Premier of Tasmania from 1876 to 1877. The Entally Estate was established in 1819 by Thomas Haydock Reibey II in Hadspen, Tasmania. The original house and some outbuildings are now a historic house on the outskirts of Launceston, in northern Tasmania. Mary, the matriarch of the family, had been transported to Australia in 1790 for the crime of horse stealing, then aged 14. She would later marry a junior officer of the East India Company, Thomas Reibey (senior), who established the Entally name as a successful trading company that owned a number of vessels running coal up the Hawkesbury River in New South Wales. Following her husband’s death in 1811, Mary became one of the richest and most successful businesswomen in Australia. She then obtained the grant of 300 acres of land upon which Thomas II was to settle and build the homestead and outbuildings.\n\nAt least three novels have been written based on her life. The novel \"Sara Dane\" by Catherine Gaskin, which has sold over 2 million copies, is only loosely factually accurate. It was made into a television mini-series in 1982, which added romantic entanglements and a second-marriage for the character, Sarah Dane, which did not occur for Mary Reibey . More accurate is the novel \"Mary Reibey\" by Kathleen Pullen. A neglected but interesting Australian children's author, Nance Donkin's historical children's novel \"House By the Water\" (Angus and Robertson; Sydney, 1970: Penguin; Ringwood, 1973) tells part of Mary Reibey's story, but is no longer in print. Donkin also wrote \"An Emancipist\", illustrated by Jane Robinson (Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1968), a biography of Mary Reibey, written for children.\n\n\n\n"}

Many Muslim countries have witnessed disproportionately high emigration rates among their Christian minorities for several generations. Today, most Middle Eastern people in the United States are Christians, and the majority of Arabs living outside the Arab World are Arab Christians.\n\nPush factors motivating Christians to emigrate include religious discrimination, persecution, and cleansing. Pull factors include prospects of upward mobility as well as joining relatives abroad.\n\nThe majority of Arabs living outside the Arab World are Arab Christians. Christians have emigrated from the Middle East, a phenomenon that has been attributed to various causes included economic factors, political and military conflict, and feelings of insecurity or isolation among minority Christian populations. The higher rate of emigration among Christians, compared to other religious groups, has also been attributed to their having stronger support networks available abroad, in the form of existing emigrant communities.\n\nAs with most diaspora Arabs, a substantial proportion of the Egyptian diaspora consists of Arab Christians. The Copts have been emigrating from Egypt both to improve their economic situation and to escape systematic harassment and persecution in their homeland.\n\nChristians and other religious minorities make up a disproportionately high share of the Iranian diaspora.\n\nFollowing the Iraq War, the Christian population of Iraq has collapsed. Of the nearly 1 million Assyro-Chaldean Christians, most have emigrated to the United States, Canada, Australia and within some of the 28 member states of the European Union and most of the rest concentrated within the northern Kurdish enclave of Iraqi Kurdistan. With continuing insurgency, Iraqi Christians are under constant threat or radical Islamic violence.\n\nSince the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the resulting breakdown of law and order in that country, many Syriac speaking Assyrians and other Christians have fled the country, taking refuge in Syria, Jordan and further afield. Their percentage of the population has declined from 12% in 1948 (4.8 million population), to 7% in 1987 (20 million) and 6% in 2003 (27 million). Despite Assyrians making up only 3% of Iraq's population, on October 2005, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported of the 700,000 Iraqis who took refuge in Syria between October 2003 and March 2005, 36% were \"Iraqi Christians.\"\n\nLebanon has experienced a large migration of Lebanese Christians for many generations. There are more Lebanese people living outside of Lebanon (8.6-14 million), than within (4.3 million). The majority of the diaspora population consists of Lebanese Christians; however, there are some who are Muslim, Druze, or Jewish. They trace their origin to several waves of Christian emigration, starting with the exodus that followed the 1860 Lebanon conflict in Ottoman Syria.\n\nUnder the current Lebanese nationality law, diaspora Lebanese do not have an automatic right of return to Lebanon. Due to varying degrees of assimilation and high degree of interethnic marriages, most diaspora Lebanese have not passed on the Arabic language to their children, while still maintaining a Lebanese ethnic identity.\n\nThe Lebanese Civil War has further fed the higher Christian emigration rate. Higher Muslim birthrates, the presence of Palestinians in Lebanon and Syrian migrant workers have contributed to reducing the Christian proportion of the Lebanese population. Lebanese Christians still remain culturally and politically prominent, forming 35-40% of the population. Since the end of the Lebanese Civil War, Muslim emigrants have outnumbered Christians, but the latter remain somewhat over-represented compared to their proportion of the population.\n\nIn the Palestinian National Authority, there has been considerable emigration and Palestinian Christians are disproportionately represented within the Palestinian diaspora. Most of Gazan Christians have fled the Gaza Strip following the Hamas takeover in 2007, largely relocating to the West Bank.\n\nThere are almost as many Syrian people living outside of Syria (15 million), as within (18 million). The majority of the diaspora population consists of Syrian Christians. They trace their origin to several waves of Christian emigration, starting with the exodus from the time of the Ottoman Syria.\nUnder the current nationality law, diaspora Syrians do not have an automatic right of return to Syria. Due to varying degrees of assimilation and high degree of interethnic marriages, most diaspora Syrians have not passed on the Arabic language to their children, while still maintaining a Syrian ethnic identity.\n\nFollowing the eruption of Syrian civil war in 2011, Christians have been targeted by militant Islamists, and hence have become a major component of the Syrian refugees.\n\nIn FY 2016, when the US dramatically increased the number of refugees admitted from Syria, the US let in 12,587 refugees from the country, with 99% being Muslims (with few Shia Muslims admitted). Less than 1% where Christian and according to the Pew Research Center analysis of State Department Refugee Processing Center data. The religious affiliation of Syria's 17.2 million people in 2016 was approximately 74% Sunni Islam, 13% Alawi, Ismaili and Shia Islam, 10% Christian and 3% Druze. The population has declined by more than 6 million, refugees, due to the Civil War.\n\nOriginally, most emigrants from what is now Turkey were Christian subjects of the Ottoman Empire, including Greek refugees. Today, emigration from Turkey consists primarily of Muslims.\n\nThe percentage of Christians in Turkey fell from 19 percent (possible 24% dur to Ottoman undercounts) in 1914 to 2.5 percent in 1927, due to events which had a significant impact on the country's demographic structure, such as the Armenian Genocide, the massacre of 500,000 Greeks and 375,000 Assyrian Christians, population exchange between Greece and Turkey, and the emigration of Christians (such as Levantines, Greeks, Armenians etc.) to foreign countries (mostly in Europe, the Americas, Lebanon and Syria) that actually began in the late 19th century and gained pace in the first quarter of the 20th century, especially during World War I and after the Turkish War of Independence. Ottoman censuses undercounted the number of Christians which was closer to 24-5% of the population: 4.3 million not 3 million as reported. Today there are more than 160,000 people of different Christian denominations, representing less than 0.2 percent of Turkey's population, Today there are more than 200,000-320,000 people of different Christian denominations representing roughly 0,3-0.4 percent of Turkey's population.\n\nChristians have also fled from India but for their own reasons and in very few numbers, as India has been considered as one of safest place for them in South Asia. Moreover India has been one of the favourite tourist destination of the people of United States, Europe in South Asia. However, there's no legal confirmation that claims any kind of violence against Christians. This was also seen that Indian people celebrates Christmas festival with full enthusiasm and love.\n\nChristians have also fled Pakistan, especially in response to the application of Islamic blasphemy laws.\n\nChristians have also fled China, especially in response to waves of religious persecution has been a contributory factors in emigration from China since it is a communist state, and its declared state atheism.\n\nChristians have also fled North Korea, especially in response to waves of religious persecution has been a contributory factors in emigration from North Korea since it is a communist state, and its declared state atheism.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1822425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822425", "title": "Vacation rental", "text": "Vacation rental\n\nA vacation rental is the renting out of a furnished apartment, house, or professionally managed resort-condominium complex on a temporary basis to tourists as an alternative to a hotel. The term \"vacation rental\" is mainly used in the US. In Europe the term villa rental or villa holiday is preferred for rentals of detached houses in warm climates. Other terms used are self-catering rentals, short term rentals, holiday homes, holiday lets (in the United Kingdom), cottage holidays (for rentals of smaller accommodation in rural locations) and gîtes (in rural locations in France). \n\nVacation rentals have long been a popular travel option in Europe (especially in the UK) as well as in Canada and are becoming increasingly popular across the world.\n\nVacation rentals usually occur in privately owned vacation properties (holiday homes), so the variety of accommodation is broad and inconsistent. The property is a fully furnished property, such as a holiday villa, apartment, cottage, condominium, townhome or single-family-style home. Farm stay can encompass participation on a working farm, or a more conventional rental that happens to be co-located on a farm. The client/traveler arranges to rent the vacation rental property for a designated period of time. Some rent on a nightly basis similar to hotel rooms, although the more prevalent vacation rental industry practice is typically weekly rentals.\n\nVacation rentals can range from budget studio apartments to lavish, expensive private villas in the world's most desirable locations, some with pricetags of many thousands per night and all the amenities you would find in any luxury accommodation (fully staffed, private beaches, boats, chefs, cooking lessons, etc.) to cater to the guests.\n\nSome vacation rentals, particularly condominiums or apartments, offer many of the same services hotels offer to their guests, e.g., front desk check-in, 24-hour maintenance, in-house housekeeping, and concierge service. Many \"hospitality, timeshare and premier independent resorts... that until now, access to these resort-condominium complexes was available exclusively through purchase options such as whole, fractional, or timeshare ownership,\" are now offering daily vacation rentals. \n\nAt the other end of the spectrum are campervan and motorhome rentals.\n\nVilla holidays are very popular in Europe, and main destinations include Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Greece, and Turkey. In France, they are known as gîtes.\n\nVacation rentals are available in most states of the US and is prevalent in major tourist areas such as Florida, Hawaii and California, as well as in other coastal areas with beaches, where they may be referred to as beach houses, many of which are rentals. The vacation rental market is much larger in Europe than in the United States, and Florida is a popular destination for villa holidays for Europeans.\n\nConsumers unfamiliar with the concept of a vacation rental may confuse it with the seemingly similar, but distinctly different, timeshare. Many timeshare resorts offer quarter ownership, which provides 13 weeks of use or rental.\n\nA timeshare can still be made available as a vacation rental should an owner decide to put his or her owned week(s) on a vacation rental program. Also, a large segment of the 21% of unsold and therefore still resort-controlled inventory is made available as vacation rentals. In 2014, this was a $1.9 billion business. \n\nA timeshare is a piece of real estate—often a fully furnished condominium—that is jointly shared by multiple owners. While different types of timeshare ownerships exist, in general, each owner bears a portion of the responsibility, along with the right to a segment of time in which he or she is granted sole use of the property. Timeshare resorts allow financially qualified guests to rent and tour their unowned properties and then make those properties available to the guest for purchase. Timeshare owners can also choose to bank their week with an exchange company such as RCI or Interval International, or rent the unit.\n\nTraditional hotels generally do not include vacation properties. However, some contemporary resort developments include shared ownership components such as villas and condominiums that can be either rented through the hotel or rented out by their owners either directly or through agencies.\n\nEvercore estimates the global addressable vacation rental market to be $100 billion, with two-thirds of the market \"for rent by owner\". \n\nVacation rentals and villa rentals are arranged either direct with the owner or through an agency, usually via the internet. Many owners have their own websites, but most also use listing services, which display property information and photos provided by the homeowner. Because each property owner has his or her own deposit and payment requirements, cancellation policies, key-pick-up procedures, etc., a guest contacts the property owner directly in order to book. \n\nThere are different kinds of listing sites, with different specialisms (for example, destination-specific, luxury, rural, etc.) and features (such as instant booking or loyalty programs). \n\nIn November 2015, Expedia bought HomeAway (which also owns VRBO and many other vacation rental brands) to compete with Airbnb . \n\nThere are also other online vacation rental sites that specialize in metasearch or resort residences. \n\nIn contrast, vacation rental agencies handle reservations and billing on the homeowner's behalf, and there is no direct contact between the guest and the owner. Because the fee or commission charged to an owner by an agency is higher than that charged by a listing service, the rent tends to be higher.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, villa holidays are also sold by tour operators as packages including flights and car hire. This is convenient for guests who prefer not to make their own arrangements, but may not be cheaper and does not usually allow the guest to choose a specific property.\n\nMost property owners contract a vacation rental management company to manage their vacation rentals. These companies handle housekeeping and property maintenance. Some management companies also act as agencies, marketing the vacation rental property and handling reservations and billing. Most vacation rental management companies work on a commission basis, meaning they do not make a guarantee to the homeowner in terms of weeks that will be rented or revenue earned. Rather, they collect a commission ranging from 20% to 50% of any revenues generated.\n\nAn alternative arrangement is where vacation rental managers provide homeowners with a guaranteed rental. Under these arrangements vacation rental managers buy all of the weeks the homeowner wishes to rent in a single transaction. This provides the homeowner with guaranteed income, and puts the risk and management burden on the rental manager.\n\nSome travelers avoid vacation rentals for fear of what industry insiders call SNAD: \"Significantly Not As Described\". This refers to a property that looks like paradise in the photos, only to reveal leaky roofs and blocked views upon the traveler's arrival. To reduce this risk, many vacation rental companies offer user reviews.\n\nAnother significant concern is that people may create false accounts, and advertise vacation homes which they do not in fact own. This can lead to unsuspecting customers booking and paying for a vacation, only to find on arrival that the rental does not exist. Given that the accommodation has been booked and paid for many months in advance, the culprit may disappear without trace, leaving the customer out of pocket. \n\nIn many counties, towns and cities, local authorities attempt to regulate or ban vacation rentals after complaints from local residents or competing lodging businesses. In the United States, New York City, Chicago and other cities have introduced restrictions on short term rentals, though regulation is not always strictly enforced. The City of Portland, for example, does not allow rentals of less than 30 days in residential zones; however, according to local vacation property managers, the average guest stays 3-10 nights.\n\nIn most US cities and counties, zoning ordinances prohibit any type of lodging business in some areas zoned for residential use. In some areas, zoning allows limited lodging uses provided that they are secondary to the primary residential use of the property.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1822426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822426", "title": "Jim Traber", "text": "Jim Traber\n\nJames Joseph Traber (born December 26, 1961) is an American former professional baseball first baseman, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Kintetsu Buffaloes. After retiring from baseball, he pursued a career in broadcast media.\n\nTraber was born in Columbus, Ohio, but grew up in Columbia, Maryland. While attending Wilde Lake High School in Columbia, he was an All-American — playing football, baseball, and other sports. Traber attended Oklahoma State University in the early 1980s, where he played both baseball (appearing twice in the College World Series) and football.\n\nTraber was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 21st round (544th overall) of the 1982 Major League Baseball draft. and played parts of four seasons for the Orioles between 1984 and 1989, where his nickname was \"The Whammer\". During the biggest slump of his career for Baltimore, Traber found success by switching to a V-neck jersey. He soon found himself on a career-best hot streak that saw him crank out six homers and 17 runs batted in (RBI), while hitting .340, in his first 13 games, after being recalled in the summer of 1986. Traber's success with Baltimore was hindered by unfortunate timing — as veteran first baseman, Eddie Murray, wasn't ready to retire and Traber was anxious to play in that position — and he had not received any instruction as an outfielder in Minor League Baseball (MiLB), as his manager Earl Weaver lamented. Thus, Traber’s options were limited to being a reserve-first baseman, DH, and pinch hitter.\n\nAfter his MLB career, Traber played baseball in Japan for the Kintetsu Buffaloes in 1990 and 1991, and one season for Monterrey of the Mexican League in 1993. His time in Japan is perhaps most memorable for an incident in which Traber rushed the mound subsequent to being hit by a pitch, chasing the retreating pitcher into the outfield at the Akita Yabase Baseball Stadium. After charging the pitcher a second time, he was knocked off balance by the catcher while running and was kicked in the face on the way down by the manager, Masaichi Kaneda. Grainy footage of this incident is still widely distributed on the Internet.\n\nTraber’s involvement with sports talk radio began after his retirement from professional sports. He served as a television color analyst for Fox Sports' regional coverage of the Arizona Diamondbacks during the team's World Series victory season of 2001, for which he was awarded a World Series ring. Traber was also part-time color analyst for the 2001 World Series radio broadcast. He can be heard cheering in celebration behind Greg Schulte during the famous play-by-play call of \"A little blooper... Base hit! Diamondbacks Win!\" for Luis Gonzalez's game-winning hit. Traber continued announcing in 2002 and 2003. Currently, Traber hosts \"The Afternoon Sports Beat\" and \"Total Dominance Hour,\" shows on WWLS-FM radio station in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He sometimes refers to callers as Yardbirds.\n\nTraber is most well-known for losing to \"Radio Legend\", \"World Champion at FreeCell\" and \"King of the midgets\" Al Eschbach every Friday at music.\n\nTraber had a long standing bet with other Sports Animal hosts that Tiger Woods will never win another major, which he would end up losing when Woods won the 2019 Masters Tournament on April 14, 2019.\n\nTraber sang the National Anthem at Memorial Stadium the night of his MLB debut.\n\n"}

{"id": "1822431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822431", "title": "Persil Power", "text": "Persil Power\n\nPersil Power was a laundry detergent product developed and sold in the mid-1990s by Unilever.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Unilever's Persil detergent risked losing its market-leading position as independent tests were showing the major brands to have relatively similar performance in removing stains. Unilever decided that they needed a product with an edge in stain removal. Persil's main competitor, Ariel, had recently introduced Ariel Ultra, the first of the \"super compacts\" - washing powders equipped with chemical catalysts which (according to the advertising) cleaned better than ever, with less powder. Given Ariel Ultra's success, and with Persil Micro System lagging, Unilever needed a new super-compact Persil line. Thus, Persil Power was conceived.\n\nUnilever's research teams found a manganese(IV)-based catalyst that sped up the decomposition of sodium perborate and sodium percarbonate which act as bleaches in the washing process, increasing the cleaning performance noticeably and allowing use of lower temperatures. Unilever decided that the bleaching agents would be an ideal addition to the product, but had worries over such a major alteration to the formula of one of their main products (a high profile example of this being New Coke, with a more direct example being in the late 1980s when one of Persil's competitors, Daz, introduced a new formula that also increased cleaning performance, but caused allergic reactions in a small but noticeable percentage of the population). To this end they decided to split the catalyst agent (together with some fabric softening agents) into a new product, Persil Power. In May 1994, Persil Power was launched with a large publicity campaign, but a number of problems soon became apparent.\n\nDespite the large publicity campaign, the sales of Persil and Persil Power did not significantly increase, because Persil by itself was capable of dealing with most stains. The most serious problem was that after a few washes with Persil Power, clothes first started to lose their colour definition and then their structural integrity, ripping easily under any significant stress. Effectively, washing clothes in Persil Power had the same effect as adding bleach to the clothes. Further testing determined that while the effects weren't apparent on new clothes (which Unilever had performed most of Persil Power's testing with) they could become very quickly apparent on older clothes. The effects were largely determined to be due to Persil Power being\na little \"too\" powerful in the recommended quantities, and a chemical reaction (which Unilever had not detected) occurring between the catalyst agents and dyes used commonly in clothes. Subsequently, a hasty reformulation with less catalyst was released, but that too was suspected of causing problems and was equally mired by the bad publicity.\n\nConsidering the embarrassment the episode had caused Unilever and the prohibitive cost of redesigning the product, they decided to issue a product recall and then simply abandon the brand. A number of lawsuits were issued against Unilever by retail chains and consumers, but the vast majority of them were settled outside of court. Afterwards, Persil were able to refine their main product's formula enough to produce comparable cleaning performance without needing a catalyst. This led to a relaunch of the super-compact format as \"New Generation Persil\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1822436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822436", "title": "Chien-Ming Wang", "text": "Chien-Ming Wang\n\nChien-Ming Wang (; born March 31, 1980) is a Taiwanese former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Washington Nationals, Toronto Blue Jays and Kansas City Royals. He also played for the Taiwan national baseball team, and is the current bullpen coach and assistant pitching coach.\n\nWang signed as an amateur free agent with the Yankees in 2000. After working his way up the Yankees' minor league system for several seasons, he made his MLB debut in 2005. With his hard sinker, he was one of the best starting pitchers for the Yankees in 2006 and 2007, winning 19 games in both seasons and leading the American League in that category in 2006. He suffered a foot injury in 2008 that limited his appearances and effectiveness, and a series of arm injuries cost him most of the 2009 season and all of 2010. Wang returned to major leagues with the Washington Nationals in 2011, starting 21 games over two seasons while again spending time on the disabled list. He signed with the Yankees in 2013 but was released without pitching in the major leagues, then signed with the Toronto Blue Jays and made six starts with limited effectiveness. He pitched for minor league teams in several organizations in 2014 and 2015. In 2016, he returned to the major leagues as a relief pitcher with the Kansas City Royals.\n\nWang was the third major leaguer from Taiwan, following Dodgers outfielder Chin-Feng Chen, and Rockies pitcher Chin-Hui Tsao.\n\nWang rose through the New York Yankees minor league system, including the Single-A Staten Island Yankees, who retired his #41 in 2006. Wang posted a 1.75 ERA for Staten Island, second-lowest in franchise history. He played for the World Team in the All-Star Futures Game in 2003. In 2005, Wang was called up from the Yankees' Triple-A affiliate, the Columbus Clippers. In 2013, Wang came back to the Yankees' Triple-A affiliate, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders.\n\nWang made his MLB debut on April 30, 2005. He pitched in 18 games, though an injury kept him sidelined for part of the season. He went 8–5 with an earned run average of 4.02. On September 19, 2005, Wang tied a record for assists in a game by a pitcher with nine. In the playoffs against the Angels, Wang pitched 6 innings and allowed 4 runs, only one of which was earned. The Yankees lost the game and the series.\nIn 2006 Wang won 19 games (tied for the most in the majors along with Johan Santana), posted a 3.63 ERA and even picked up his first save on June 3 against the Baltimore Orioles. Wang threw two complete games, though the first, on June 18, was bittersweet: against the Washington Nationals, he allowed a 1-out, 2-run, walk-off home run by Ryan Zimmerman to lose the game 3–2. His first complete game win was on July 28, 2006, a 2-hit, 6–0 shutout of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Yankee Stadium. In his next start, he threw eight shutout innings against the Toronto Blue Jays, in which he got an outstanding 18 ground ball outs. Wang started the first game of the Division Series against the Detroit Tigers. Wang earned the win as the Yankees beat Detroit 8–4.\n\nOverall in 2006, Wang limited batters to a .211 batting average while games were tied, and a .205 batting average in games that were late and close. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays batted just .159 against him, losing three out of four games to the Yankees that Wang pitched. Wang was effective despite the lowest strikeout rate in the majors (3.14 strikeouts per nine innings and 76 strikeouts overall), thanks in part to his allowing the fewest home runs per nine innings (0.5). Wang also led the league in ground ball percentage (62.8%) and obtained 2.84 groundouts for every fly ball out.\n\nAt the end of the season, Wang finished second to Johan Santana in voting for the Cy Young Award. Wang collected 15 second-place votes, and 51 points. He also received a ninth-place vote, good for two points, in the AL MVP balloting, won by Justin Morneau. In MLB.com's This Year in Baseball Awards, he was chosen as the top starter in 2006 season with more than 47% of the fan vote.\n\nWang began the 2007 season on the disabled list, having injured his right hamstring during spring training. He returned on April 24 against Tampa Bay. On May 5, 2007, Wang pitched 7 perfect innings before giving up a home run to Ben Broussard of the Seattle Mariners, falling five outs short of a perfect game.\n\nOn June 17, 2007, Wang had a superb outing versus the New York Mets, in which he threw 113 pitches through 8 and 2/3 innings for 10 strikeouts (a career high) and just 6 hits. On August 30, Wang took a no-hitter against the Boston Red Sox into the seventh inning before giving up a single to Mike Lowell. Rookies Joba Chamberlain and Edwar Ramírez finished the two-hitter, and the Yankees beat the Red Sox 5–0.\nIn 2007 Wang was 2nd in the AL in wins (19), 3rd for the second straight year in win-loss percentage (.731), 9th in wild pitches (9), and 10th in hit batsmen (8). He had a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage. He also had the lowest HR/9 innings pitched ratio in the AL (0.41), was 3rd in GB% (58.5%) and GB/FB (2.51), and had the 5th-lowest strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (4.70).\nDespite his regular season performance, Wang faltered in the 2007 postseason. In the American League Division Series against the Cleveland Indians, Wang started two games, earning the loss in both appearances. He pitched a combined 5 and 2/3 innings, giving up 12 earned runs, for a postseason ERA of 19.06. The Yankees lost the ALDS in four games.\n\nThe beginning of the 2008 season saw Wang at the top of the Yankees rotation and the ace with veterans Mike Mussina and Andy Pettitte. In the final Yankee Stadium season opener against the Toronto Blue Jays, Wang pitched 7.0 innings, allowing only 2 runs and picking up his first win of the season. In his first start against the Boston Red Sox in 2008, he pitched a one-run, two-hit complete game.\n\nOn April 22, 2008, Wang recorded a win against the Chicago White Sox at U.S. Cellular Field. The victory, in Wang's 85th career start, made him the fastest Major Leaguer to record 50 wins as a starter since Dwight Gooden, who won his 50th game in his 82nd start on June 29, 1986, at Chicago for the New York Mets. Wang also became the quickest Yankee to 50 wins since Ron Guidry, who accomplished this in his 82nd start.\n\nWang finished April with a perfect 5–0 record, leading the American League along with Joe Saunders. On May 2, Wang became the first six-game winner in the American League with a win over the Seattle Mariners with just one earned run over six innings. On May 8, Cliff Lee of the Cleveland Indians beat Wang 3–0, handing Wang his first loss of the season. During this loss, Wang allowed three runs and five hits in seven innings. On June 10, after going six starts with two losses and four no decisions since May 2, Wang defeated the Oakland Athletics 3–1 to end the longest victory drought of his career. Through 2008, Wang had the third highest winning percentage of all starting pitchers over the last three years (46–15, .754).\n\nOn June 15, Wang was taken out of an interleague game versus the Houston Astros due to a right foot injury he sustained while running the bases, something he was not used to doing, since pitchers do not bat in the American League. Wang was diagnosed with a torn Lisfranc ligament of the right foot and a partial tear of the peroneus longus of the right foot. Despite not requiring surgery, he was on crutches and wearing a protective boot. The cast was removed on July 29, but the extensive rehabilitation process prevented Wang from pitching for the remainder of the season. Yankees' part-owner Hank Steinbrenner showed frustration with pitchers having to bat in the National League and suggested that the League \"join the modern age\". On December 22, 2008, Wang and the New York Yankees avoided salary arbitration when they agreed to a $5 million, one-year contract. Wang made $4 million in the 2008 season after losing in salary arbitration. He had asked for $4.6 million.\n\nOn April 3, 2009, Wang became the first Yankees' starting and the first game winning pitcher of the new Yankee Stadium in the stadium opener exhibition game against Chicago Cubs. His regular season began with an extraordinarily bad performance. In his first start of the regular season, Wang gave up 7 earned runs and 9 hits in 3.2 innings against the Baltimore Orioles. That was followed by a one-inning appearance against the Tampa Bay Rays when he surrendered 8 earned runs in just one inning. In his third start, against the Cleveland Indians in New York on April 18, Wang was credited for eight more earned runs in 1.1 innings; Cleveland won the game 22–4. After his first 3 appearances, Wang was 0–3 with a whopping 34.50 ERA.\n\nThere was speculation that the right foot injury Wang sustained during the 2008 season caused him to compensate with the rest of his pitching motion, leading to his 2009 struggles. Following the April 18 game manager Joe Girardi said, \"We have some time. We have a day off, I think Thursday, and we're going to have to decide what's best for Chien-Ming Wang and the team.\" On April 22, General Manager Brian Cashman, at a Q&A at Southern Connecticut State University, confirmed Wang's release point was 5 inches higher than the same time the previous season.\n\nAfter being removed from the rotation and sent down to Tampa to work out mechanical issues, Wang was diagnosed with weakness in the muscles of both hips and placed on the disabled list. He was activated from the disabled list on May 22, 2009, and on his first day on the active roster, he was brought in from the bullpen. After two more relief appearances, Wang went back to the rotation, but he struggled once again in his first and second starts back. On June 28, Wang earned his first win of the season, also his first since June 15, 2008, giving up two runs over 5.1 innings against the New York Mets.\n\nWang was placed on the disabled list on July 15, 2009 due to shoulder soreness. He was then eliminated for the remainder of the season after undergoing shoulder surgery on July 30, 2009. After the Yankees won the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, Wang participated in the championship parade through the Canyon of Heroes, but acknowledged it \"would have been more fun\" if he had been healthy. On December 12, 2009, the Yankees made the choice not to re-sign him, making him a free agent.\n\nOn February 19, 2010, the Washington Nationals announced they had signed Wang as a free agent to a $2 million deal (plus up to $3 million in incentives). In June, it was thought that Wang would return to the majors in late July or early August. However, Wang's rehabilitation had been inconsistent, and there was no timetable for his return to the majors. In September, the Nationals acknowledged that Wang would not pitch in the majors at all during the season, but instead was preparing for the instructional leagues in the fall.\nWang was non-tendered after the 2010 season. On December 16, 2010, Wang re-signed with the Nationals to a one-year, $1 million contract with $4 million worth of potential performance incentives. After continuing his injury rehabilitation, he began a formal rehab assignment on June 27 with the Nationals' Class A farm team, the Hagerstown Suns, pitching three innings, allowing two earned runs while striking out three and walking none. Although his velocity topped out at around 90 mph, it mostly sat between 86 and 88 mph. In his second start, on July 2 with the high-A Potomac Nationals, Wang pitched 4 shutout innings, and allowed 2 walks while striking out 2. 63% of his 38 pitches were strikes while his velocity hit 91 mph in his final inning of work.\n\nFollowing a July 24 start for the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs, Wang made his Nationals debut on July 29.\nWang ended the season with 11 starts, recorded 4–3 with a 4.04 ERA. He also made his first hit and first RBI in the majors in his final start of the season, Sep 24 against the Atlanta Braves' starting pitcher Brandon Beachy.\n\nOn October 30, 2011, Wang was granted free agency. Five days later on November 4, Wang re-signed with the Nationals to a one-year, $4 million contract.\nOn March 15, 2012, Wang sustained an injury to his left hamstring, placing him on the DL.\n\nOn May 25, Wang pitched in the majors for the first time since going on the disabled list. He went 3 innings in his first win that season. He then replaced Ross Detwiler as the starting pitcher. In just 4 starts, Wang went 1-3 with an ERA of 6.10 and 11 strikeouts.\n\nOn September 23, Wang hit the first career double against Milwaukee Brewers' starting pitcher Yovani Gallardo.\n\nOn March 22, 2013 Wang signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees. According to his agents and Taiwan's EETV, his minors contract is worth US$35,000 per month, but could worth up to $2.5 million per year, with an extra $2.2 million in bonuses. However, if he did not secure a major league contract by the end of April, he had the option to revert to free-agent status. Wang opted out of his contract on June 7, 2013.\n\nWang signed a one-year, $500,000 deal with the Toronto Blue Jays on June 9, 2013. He was added to the Blue Jays' roster on June 11, making his first pitching appearance as a starter against the Chicago White Sox. Toronto Blue Jays general manager Alex Anthopoulos said that the team guaranteed Wang one start, and would decide on further appearances based on the result of his first start. Wang earned his first win as a Blue Jay in a game against the Texas Rangers on June 16, pitching seven shutout innings. The win gave the Blue Jays their first 4-game sweep in the 2013 season, and the first 4-game sweep of the Rangers in Arlington in Blue Jays franchise history.\n\nFrom June 11, the date Wang was added to their roster, to June 23, the Blue Jays went on an 11-game winning streak. Wang started three games during the streak, pitching at least 6 innings in each and compiling an ERA of 2.18. Wang followed up his successful streak by starting two games in which he was unable to make it out of the second inning. On June 27, Wang pitched 1 innings against the Boston Red Sox and surrendered 6 hits and 7 earned runs. On July 2, he also pitched only 1 innings and gave up 8 hits and 6 earned runs to the Detroit Tigers. After the Tigers game, Blue Jays manager John Gibbons announced that Wang had been designated for assignment. Wang was reported to be willing to accept an assignment to Triple-A Buffalo and was outrighted to Buffalo on July 5. Wang was added to the Blue Jays roster again on August 24, and designated for assignment on August 26. After clearing waivers, he was again outrighted to the Buffalo Bisons. He became a free agent on October 1.\n\nOn December 19, 2013, Wang signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Cincinnati Reds. He began the 2014 season with the Louisville Bats of the International League, but opted out of his deal on July 13. Wang signed a minor league contract with the White Sox on July 17, and pitched for the Charlotte Knights of the International League.\n\nDuring the 2014–15 offseason, Wang signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves. The Braves assigned Wang to the Gwinnett Braves of the International League. In 10 starts and one relief appearance, Wang had a 2-6 record with an ERA of 6.10, while surrendering the most hits in Triple-A up to the month of June. He was released on June 19.\n\nWang signed with the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, and independent baseball league, on June 24. He made three starts for the Blue Crabs, winning all three and pitching to a 2.49 ERA. On July 12, 2015, Wang signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners. They assigned him to the Tacoma Rainiers of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League.\n\nOn January 7, 2016, Wang signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals. After a strong spring training, he made the Royals' opening day roster for the 2016 season as a relief pitcher. On April 9, 2016, Wang threw a scoreless 9th inning in a 7-0 victory against the Minnesota Twins. This was his first major league game since August 25, 2013. Wang pitched for the Royals 38 times for innings over the year, going 6-0 with a 4.22 ERA. He went on the disabled list with right biceps tendinitis on August 31 and was designated for assignment on September 17, 2016. He was released on September 22.\n\nWang pitched for the Chinese Taipei national baseball team in the 2002 Asian Games. In 2004, as the ace of the staff, Wang led Taiwan to the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. Against Australia, he allowed just three hits with no walks, and at one point retired nine batters in a row, to earn the win. He also limited Japan to just five hits in the first six innings.\n\nAfter being called up to the American major leagues, Wang was idolized in Taiwan where all of his games were televised nationwide, many on public big screens to large audiences. Because of this popularity, he was named one of the \"Time\" 100 for 2007.\n\nAt the 2013 World Baseball Classic, Wang started for the Taiwan team's opener against Australia and threw 6 shut out innings for the win.\n\nDuring his prime, Wang was a finesse pitcher with a power pitcher's velocity. In this period, he primarily relied on his power sinker along with the occasional four-seam fastball, slider, changeup, and splitter. His sinker, which was responsible for his elevation to ace status before his foot injury, had very impressive lateral movement and was thrown at greater than average velocity, sitting in the 91–94 mph range. Before his first shoulder injury, he also had a curveball until he was encouraged to opt for a sinker instead. By 2016, after a long recovery process, Wang's sinker had returned to the 89-93 mph range, with a top speed of 95 mph.\n\nHis strikeout pitch is an average slider that closely resembles the fastball coming out of his hand, thus getting batters to swing ahead of the pitch. Wang also throws a split-finger fastball, though he only uses the pitch sparsely when in need of a strikeout or double play. Wang's pitching style is characterized by efficiency, command of the strike zone, few walks, few home runs allowed but also records very few strikeouts. Wang works quickly and uses his ground-ball inducing sinker to produce many double plays. This efficiency often allows Wang to maintain a low pitch count deep into games.\n\nIn Taiwan and the minor leagues, Wang threw a more conventional assortment of pitches, including a four-seam fastball, a changeup, and far more splitters. The sinker, which has become Wang's signature pitch, was developed during his minor league career with advice from Neil Allen, his Triple-A pitching coach, and his Triple-A catcher, Sal Fasano.\n\nPrior to the 2008 season, Wang relied on his sinking fastball about 90% of the time. However, after occasional bad outings, especially during the 2007 ALDS, Wang has worked to fully incorporate a slider and changeup into his repertoire. Through his first three starts of 2008, Wang used his slider roughly 20% of the time and his changeup around 8%.\n\nIn a 2006 \"The New York Times\" interview, Wang revealed that he is the biological child of the man he formerly thought was his uncle. Due to the media frenzy created in Taiwan over this, he briefly refused to give interviews to Taiwanese media. Wang has also been taught basic English. He has resided in Fort Lee, New Jersey and Edgewater, New Jersey. On April 23, 2012, Wang admitted to having an extramarital affair while he was recovering from a shoulder injury in 2009.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Wang's biological maternal grandfather, a man surnamed Huang, 82, committed suicide in a park in Tainan, Taiwan by hanging himself with a piece of electrical cord, according to a news report in the \"Taipei Times\". Wang often visited this maternal grandfather when he returned to Taiwan from time to time. Wang is married to Chia-Ling Wu. The couple has two sons, J.J., born 2009, and Wellington, born 2013.\n\nA documentary about Wang, \"\", debuted in theaters in October 2018.\n\n"}

He played in Montreal for 12 full seasons, winning six Stanley Cups and appearing in six National Hockey League All-Star Games (1958, 1959, 1960, 1962, 1965, 1967). After the 1969–70 season, Backstrom requested a trade and talked about retiring. He reported to training camp, but left the team just before the season opened. After returning to the Canadiens, Backstrom spent most of his time on the bench until being traded to the Los Angeles Kings in January 1971. Just over two years later, he was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks for Dan Maloney and finished the 1972–73 season there.\n\nBackstrom then jumped to the World Hockey Association and joined the Chicago Cougars, where he played for two years, and later became a part-owner of the team. In his first season, he led the Cougars in scoring with 33 goals and 83 points in 70 games. He also represented Canada at the 1974 Summit Series on an all-star team of Canadian WHA players. His offensive production dropped sharply in 1974-75 and at the end of the season the new Denver Spurs selected Backstrom in the WHA's expansion draft. Backstrom was the team's top scorer, but the franchise struggled, and a move to Ottawa—where the team was renamed the Ottawa Civics—did not help. The franchise ceased operations 41 games into the season. Backstrom finished the season with the New England Whalers, scoring 35 goals and 83 points over the year. He played one more year with New England and retired in 1977. He would have turned 40 before the start of the next season. Through his professional career, Backstrom had seven 20-goal seasons in the NHL and two 30-goal seasons in the WHA.\n\nImmediately after his retirement Backstrom accepted an offer to join the staff of newly appointed Denver head coach, Marshall Johnston, as an assistant. Three years later Backstrom returned to the NHL as an assistant for the Los Angeles Kings but only stayed for one season before rejoining Denver, this time as the bench boss after Johnston left to pursue opportunities in the NHL. Backstrom led the Pioneers through a few lean years in the early 1980s before having a breakout season in 1985–86 when he led Denver to still-team record 34-win season including a conference regular season title, a conference tournament title (their first in 13 years) and reached the team's first Frozen Four since finishing second in 1973. Backstrom earned both the conference and national coach of the year awards for the impressive season, but he was unable to sustain the high level of play for the remainder of his tenure. Backstrom resigned after the 1989–90 season, turning the team over to Frank Serratore.\n\nBackstrom jumped into the professional ranks in 1990–91 when he took over the Phoenix Roadrunners. After a good first season including pushing the #1 seeded Peoria Rivermen to a seventh game in the Turner Cup semifinals, Phoenix dropped to dead last in the 10-team league and Backstrom was dropped as the coach.\n\nBackstrom, along with Dennis Murphy and Larry King, founded Roller Hockey International and served as commissioner for a time but it soon became apparent that the league was in financial trouble and it suspended the entire 1998 season before playing one final campaign in 1999. While the league didn't officially disband until 2001, Backstrom meanwhile returned to the NHL in 1999–00 as a scout for the St. Louis Blues. After three seasons with the blue notes Backstrom founded a new CHL team called the Colorado Eagles. In addition to owning the team, Backstrom served as General Manager and President of the team for the first three seasons, including a league title in 2004–05. With Backstrom as owner, the Eagles finished atop their division six times, made the finals five times, and win the Ray Miron President's Cup twice in eight seasons before making a move to the ECHL in 2011–12.\n\n\nBackstrom's parents, John Albin Backstrom (died 1983) and Ester Bertils (died 1996), both immigrated (separately) to Canada from Ostrabothnia, the Swedish-speaking region of Finland, in the 1920s. His father worked as a gold miner in Kirkland Lake. A local hockey prodigy from a town that produced many NHL players, Backstrom was scouted by the Montreal Canadiens at age 16 and began his professional career soon thereafter. Backstrom has been married twice. His first wife was Frances Richard of Aylmer, Quebec (married 1961); his second is Janet Price of Nashville, Tennessee (married 1985). They currently reside in Windsor, Colorado. He has three children from his first marriage. The eldest, Martin Backstrom (born 1962) is a scholar of classical Chinese literature who retired in 2018 as Associate Director of the Institute of East Asian Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and who now resides in Palm Springs, California. His daughter Diana Backstrom of Denver, Colorado holds an advanced degree from the University of Denver. His youngest son, Andrew Backstrom, lives in Seal Beach, California. He is the cousin of NHL hockey player Daren Puppa. He is not related to NHL goalie Niklas Bäckström, nor NHL centre Nicklas Bäckström.\n\n"}

Lt. (j.g.) Naifeh was posthumously awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal. \"Naifeh\"s was keel was laid down on 29 December 1943 at the Consolidated Steel Corporation shipyard in Orange, Texas. The vessel was launched on 29 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Rathia Naifeh, mother of Lt. (j.g.) Naifeh; and commissioned on 4 July 1944, with Lieutenant J. S. Albert in command.\n\nAfter commissioning, \"Naifeh\" trained and conducted shakedown off Bermuda, then had training ship duty out of Norfolk, Virginia. The ship departed Brooklyn, New York, on 6 October 1944 on the first of 2 voyages escorting convoys to Europe and North Africa. \"Naifeh\" departed New York on 13 January 1945 and steamed via the Panama Canal to the Pacific, arriving at Manus Island, Admiralty Islands on 20 February.\n\nThe destroyer escort was assigned to the Philippine Sea Frontier, and was based at Leyte Gulf. She was primarily occupied in convoy duty until the end of the war, escorting tankers and other auxiliaries to New Guinea, Ulithi, Palau, Guam, Manila, and Okinawa. \"Naifeh\" performed other duties such as weather ship, search and rescue work, and carrying mail. Once she displayed the three star flag of Commander Philippine Sea Frontier as Vice Admiral Kauffman was embarked on an inspection tour of the islands. She rescued the crew of on 10 October 1945 after the merchantman had grounded near Batag Island, Philippines. \"Naifeh\" stood by with a watch set on the grounded ship until a salvage crew arrived from Manila.\n\nShe was detached from the Philippine Sea Frontier on 27 November 1945 and proceeded to San Diego, California, arriving there on 17 December. She decommissioned on 27 June 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego.\n\nWith the start of the Korean War, she recommissioned on 26 January 1951. \"Naifeh\" left San Diego on 16 April, assigned to the United Nations Escort and Blockade Force. She took station off Songjin Harbor, North Korea, on 28 June. The next months were occupied in shelling Communist military and logistics facilities, along with patrol action to clear the area of floating mines, junks, and possible submarines. She then screened escort carrier and off the west coast of Korea.\n\n\"Naifeh\" returned to San Francisco in November 1951. From early March 1952 to July, she was engaged in training exercises off the West Coast. In early July, the destroyer escort sailed from San Diego for Korea to rejoin Task Force 95, Blockade and Escort Group. \"Naifeh\" was assigned to the northeast coast of Korea in the Songjin-Chongjin area. Here she fired on enemy shore positions, railroads, and industrial targets.\n\nOnce bracketed by enemy shore fire, she successfully maneuvered out of range. With other assignments, she aided Republic of Korea Navy torpedo boats in interdiction missions against enemy supply lines. In late fall, \"Naifeh\" was flagship of the Wonsan Element Commander, protecting United States and Korean minesweepers and firing on shore targets. When was hit by artillery fire, \"Naifeh\" provided protective counter-battery fire as she laid a smokescreen to cover her withdrawal. In addition to blockade duty, the destroyer escort fired on North Korean supply movements in the Wonsan area. She returned to San Diego in December 1952.\n\n\"Naifeh\" again deployed to WestPac in mid-November 1953, operating off Japan, Okinawa, and Taiwan. May 1954 was spent with Marines conducting landing exercises off Pusan, Korea. She left Sasebo on 7 June 1954, arriving at San Diego on 26 June for a summer in operational training off the West Coast, highlighted by PACTRAEX and a visit to Seattle, Washington. \"Naifeh\" left San Diego on 21 November, arriving at Yokosuka on 9 December for patrol duty off the eastern coast of Korea and anti-submarine training. She assisted in the evacuation of the Tachen Islands in late January and February 1955, and returned to San Diego on 1 June.\n\nIn early March 1956, the ship sailed for her fourth WestPac deployment. Based at Guam, the ship acted as a search and rescue ready duty ship and participated in five surveillance patrols of the Northern Marianas, Bonin, and Caroline Islands before returning to Long Beach on 24 August. The remainder of 1956 and early 1957 were occupied with training operations off the California coast.\n\nLeaving Long Beach, the destroyer escort once again deployed to the western Pacific, arriving at Guam on 30 April. In the first part of May, \"Naifeh\" made a patrol in the Bonin Islands. She departed Guam on 18 May and sailed for Sasebo, where she arrived on 23 May. She operated out of Sasebo and Subic Bay on patrol duties for the rest of her deployment until 12 July, when she departed Yokosuka and sailed to San Diego, arriving there on 28 July.\n\n\"Naifeh\" then engaged in coastal operations off the West Coast until 17 June 1960, when she decommissioned at San Francisco. Berthed at Mare Island until 1 January 1966, when she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, she was towed to San Diego in early 1966 for stripping prior to being used as a target to destruction. In July, \"Naifeh\" was sunk as a target off San Clemente Island by a combination of naval gunfire and aircraft.\n\n\"Naifeh\" received three battle stars for Korean War service.\n\n"}

Mayer and starring Jada Pinkett Smith in the title role. Tommy Davidson co-stars. \"Woo\" was filmed in 1996.\n\nWoo (Smith) is an extroverted woman living in New York City, and she has a notorious knack for turning men into mush. When Woo's psychic friend Celestrial (Girlina) predicts that the man of her dreams is about to enter her life, Woo doesn't believe it is true. Celestrial, however, is convinced that Woo is destined to meet a tall, debonair Virgo. Woo's cousin Claudette (Paula Jai Parker) and Claudette's boyfriend Lenny (Dave Chappelle) plan to spend the night together but find themselves entertaining Woo instead. Lenny begs his best friend Tim Jackson (Davidson) to take Woo out - even though shy, strait-laced law clerk Tim is the polar opposite of the sassy and brassy Woo. That same night, Lenny and Claudette's night goes wrong when his obsession with chicken drives her to be forced to dress up as a sexy but awkward \"chicken ho\" (he makes her cluck and walk like a chicken) but she is allergic to feathers.\n\nAt first, Woo expresses disinterest in the matchmaking mismatch. But when she's told that Tim is a Virgo, she decides it is fate, jumps at the chance, and immediately heads for Tim's apartment. Meanwhile, Tim, who can't believe his luck, goes next door to his neighbor Darryl (LL Cool J) for tips on romancing women. Darryl supplies Tim with incense, edible body oils, and a tape of sexy songs. When Woo arrives, Tim is completely smitten. Woo, however, discovers that Tim is anything but the sexy, spontaneous stud of her dreams. Finding Tim's pseudo-cool act totally transparent, she humiliates and teases him. They are just about to exit Tim's apartment when Tim is visited by three of his pals - Frankie (Duane Martin), Hop (Darrel Heath), and Romaine (Michael Ralph). The chauvinistic attitude of Tim's friends irritates Woo, so she retaliates and freaks out the trio by acting insane. Finally, the date gets underway. Woo and Tim arrive at a stuffy Italian restaurant, but Woo's behavior gets them thrown out. They go to a dance club, where Tim becomes the victim, punched out by Woo's ex-boyfriend. Woo punches the boyfriend back. Tim becomes a repeated victim of a lot of other misfortunes, but Woo realizes that Tim is the guy she should be with. After Tim gets his car back, it is smashed to pieces. Woo offers to share her car and her life with Tim.\n\n\nTagline: \"It's her world.. we're just living in it.\"\n\n\nThe film was met with very negative reviews from audiences and critics.

One example of a popular \"cowboy poem\" written by a non-cowboy is \"The Ride of Paul Venarez\" by Eben E. Rexford, a 19th-Century freelance author.\n\nNewcomers are surprised to hear that cowboy poetry is contemporary. Many poets tend to focus on the historic cowboy lifestyle, historical events and the humorous aspects of the cowboy life style. However, the work that cowboys do continues. The cowboy lifestyle is a living tradition that exists in western North America and other areas, thus, contemporary cowboy poetry is still being created, still being recited, and still entertaining many at cowboy poetry gatherings, around campfires and cowboy poetry competitions. Much of what is known as \"old time\" country music originates from the rhyming couplet style often seen in cowboy poetry along with guitar music.\n\nTypical themes of cowboy poetry include:\n\nThe following is a verse from LaVerna Johnson's poem \"Homestead\", which exhibits traditional cowboy poetry features:\n\n(Note the use of cowboy vernacular such as \"quakie\" (Populus tremuloides, trembling poplar or aspen known as a \"quakie tree\")).\n\nThough it deals with those who work with livestock and nature, it would be incorrect to categorize cowboy poetry as pastoral. Cowboy poetry is noted for its romantic imagery, but at no time does it sacrifice realism in favor of it.\n\nFew examples of experimental verse are known in cowboy poetry. One argument is that cowboy poetry is meant to be recited and should \"sound like poetry.\" The counter-argument runs that imposing a particular structure on cowboy poetry would move the focus away from the subject matter. Regardless, most cowboy poets stay within more classical guidelines, especially rhyming verse. So-called \"free verse\" poetry is uncommon in cowboy poetry.\n\nCowboy poetry continues to be written and celebrated today. Baxter Black is probably the most famous, and possibly the most prolific, contemporary cowboy poet. In addition to the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering held every year in Elko, Nevada, many cities in the United States and Canada have annual \"roundups\" dedicated to cowboy poetry. Cowboy Poetry week is celebrated each April in the United States and Canada.\n\n\nIn addition, Robert W. Service is sometimes classified as a cowboy poet.\n\nFamed spoken-word artist Bingo Gazingo has done at least one cowboy poem, \"Everything's OK at the OK Corral.\"\n\n\n"}

He won the Calder Memorial Trophy in 1962 as NHL rookie of the year.\n\nRousseau started his career with the St. Jean Braves of the Quebec Junior Hockey League in 1955-56 where he led the league in scoring with 53 goals and 85 points in 44 games. The next season, Rousseau moved on with the Hull-Ottawa Canadiens. Rousseau helped the team reach the 1957 Memorial Cup finals where they would play against the Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters. The Canadiens took their opponents to a game 7 where they lost 3-2. This would not deter the Canadiens as they returned to the Memorial Cup again in 1957-58. Rousseau and his team won the Memorial Cup this time as they beat the Regina Pats in 6 games.\n\nIn 1960, Rousseau was loaned to the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen, the team that would represent Team Canada, at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley. Canada would finish with a silver medal at the tournament, while the USA won gold and the Soviets took the bronze. Rousseau scored 5 goals, 4 of which came in a 19-1 victory over Japan, and 9 points in 7 games during Canada's Olympic run.\n\nIn 1960-61, Rousseau earned his first chance in the National Hockey League with the Montreal Canadiens. Rousseau played in 15 games earning 3 points with the Canadiens. His style of play earned him a full spot on the roster with the Canadiens next season. He scored 21 goals and had 45 points during his first full NHL season, and was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as top rookie in the NHL that year. After winning the Calder, Rousseau had a less productive year as he scored 37 points only. In 1963-64, Rousseau scored 25 goals and had 56 points. Rousseau also had a 5-goal game against the Detroit Red Wings on February 1, 1964. The Canadiens reached the Stanley Cup Finals in 1964-65 against the Chicago Black Hawks. The series would go to 7 games, where the Canadiens would emerge victorious, giving Rousseau his first Stanley Cup win. Rousseau was also invited to the 1965 All-Star Game. During the 1965-66 NHL season, Rousseau registered 78 points and tied with Stan Mikita for second overall in the scoring race. His hard work earned him a spot on the NHL Second All-Star Team that season. Rousseau would help the Canadiens defend their Stanley Cup title as they beat the Detroit Red Wings in 6 games. The Canadiens would return to the Finals for a third straight time in 1966-67. However, Rousseau and his team could not accomplish the three-peat as they were beaten by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 6 games. This did not matter to the Canadiens and Rousseau, as they made the finals for the next 2 seasons, winning the Stanley Cup both times.\n\nAfter 9 seasons, with the Canadiens, and following a 24-goal performance the previous season, Rousseau was traded to the Minnesota North Stars where he spent the 1970-71 season. After just one season with the North Stars, he was traded to the New York Rangers in exchange for right winger Bob Nevin. Rousseau helped the Rangers reach the Stanley Cup Finals in 1971-72. Rousseau had a total of 17 points during the Rangers' run as they lost the Stanley Cup in 6 games to the Boston Bruins. After playing 2 more seasons with the Rangers, Rousseau retired after playing 8 games in 1974-75.\n\nRousseau is the brother of former NHL players Rollie and Guy Rousseau.\n\n\n"}

It was replaced by the boliviano at 1,000,000 pesos bolivianos = 1 boliviano. \"$b.\" was the currency symbol for the peso boliviano.\n\nOn December 15, 1959, Bolivia had introduced a comprehensive economic stabilization program that abolished most currency restrictions on the boliviano, which had suffered badly from inflation. The program adopted a fluctuating exchange rate that was finally stabilized in 1962 at 11,875 bolivianos to the US dollar.\n\nThe currency reform of January 1, 1963 adopted the peso boliviano, equal to 1,000 bolivianos, with an initial central exchange rate of 11·875 per US$1. But inflation soon returned and the peso boliviano was devalued 39.4% on October 27, 1972, with a new official rate of 20·00 per US$1. This rate was maintained until November 30, 1979, when the peso boliviano was put on a controlled float, initially at 25·00 per dollar. Inflation accelerated. The official rate was devalued February 5, 1982 to 44 per US$1. The average exchange rate was 64·12 per in 1982, 229·78 per in 1983, and 2,314 per in 1984. By September 1985 the US dollar was worth a million pesos bolivianos on the black market. President Paz-Estenssoro announced a free exchange rate for the peso, which was floated on August 29, 1985, resulting in an effective devaluation of 95%. All exchange controls were lifted and the exchange rate was set twice weekly according to supply and demand. Its value continued to fall and by January 1986 the government was setting a new exchange rate daily in an attempt to boost confidence in the economy. After reaching a low of about 2·2 million per US$1, the peso improved and stabilized around 1·8-1·9 million per dollar.\n\nA new monetary unit, the boliviano, was created by Law No. 901 of November 28, 1986, and a currency reform was announced December 30, 1986, effective January 1, 1987. This new boliviano replaced the peso boliviano at 1 boliviano = 1,000,000 pesos bolivianos.\n\nReform coinage was introduced in 1965 in denominations of 5, 10, 20, and 50 centavos. A 1 peso boliviano coin was introduced in 1968, a 25-centavo coin in 1971, and a 5 peso boliviano coin in 1976.

A 500 was added to the series in 1981 and a 1000 in 1982.\n\nIn 1982 the $b.100 was released in a simplified version, without a security thread and with the back lithographed rather than engraved. Fearing that these poorer quality notes were forgeries, people avoided them to such an extent that after a few months Banco Central resumed issuing the older type of 100.\n\nAs inflation gathered pace, Banco Central introduced \"cheques de gerencia\" (cashier's cheques, certified cheques, bank drafts) for 5000 and 10,000 pesos bolivianos in 1982.\n\nBy the summer of 1983 notes of 1, 5, and 20 were no longer seen in circulation, which consisted of notes for 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 pesos bolivianos.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 25, 1999. In the episode, after offending the Olympic committee during their visit to Springfield Elementary, the school's students are committed to 20 hours of community service. Bart, along with his sister Lisa, is put in charge of Springfield's retirement home, where Bart notices the doldrums that the old people go through every day. Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa's father Homer tries to sell springs.\n\n\"The Old Man and the \"C\" Student\" was directed by Mark Kirkland and was the first episode Julie Thacker wrote for \"The Simpsons\". While Bart's storyline was pitched by Thacker, the B-story, involving Homer, was conceived by Thacker's husband Mike Scully, who also was an executive producer and the showrunner for the episode. Jack Lalanne guest-starred as himself in the episode.\n\nOn its original broadcast, \"The Old Man and the \"C\" Student\" was seen by approximately 6.9 million viewers. \n\nFollowing the release of \"The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season\", the episode received mostly positive reviews from critics.\n\nWhen Lisa writes a letter to the International Olympic Committee, they decide that Springfield will be home to the next Olympics. To honor the Olympics, there is a contest for the games' mascot. Homer creates a mascot for the Olympic Games named Springy, the Springfield Spring, which becomes the mascot (much to Patty and Selma’s dismay, who created a mascot named Ciggy, a discus thrower made entirely of cigarettes and ashtrays) and everyone in Springfield prepares for the games. When the IOC inspects the town, things go well until Bart does a stand-up comedy routine that insults foreign nations, which only Principal Skinner, Homer, and the kids find funny. In response, the IOC decides not to let Springfield have the Olympics anymore (they award it to Shelbyville, who presumably and chronologically lost it to Sydney), and Superintendent Chalmers blames Skinner for putting Bart on stage with his racy jokes. Skinner initially keeps his case strong by telling Chalmers that the comedy worked well during rehearsal, but to prevent losing his job, he makes every one of the school's students do 20 hours of community service. After sending Milhouse to collect medical waste on the beach and leaving Martin to start a basketball program between inter-city gangs, Skinner has Bart assigned to work at the Springfield Retirement Castle, where Lisa also works voluntarily. Bart is dismayed at how little the seniors are allowed to do.\n\nMeanwhile, Homer gets 1,000 springs he intended to sell as Olympic mascots. He uses various get-rich-quick schemes to sell off the mascots, but fails miserably due to Springfield's hatred of Bart's comedy routine and everyone (including Marge) being annoyed by the springs. Ultimately, he is forced to flush the springs down the toilet. At the time Lisa leads the seniors in \"imagination time\", but when she departs, Bart makes the seniors escape to get a taste of freedom. Bart takes the seniors on a trip on the town and on a boat ride, and Lisa is initially shocked to see these things happen, but nevertheless, she is quite impressed by what Bart does for the seniors. The seniors have fun until their boat crashes into Mr. Burns' schooner. The boat begins to sink and the seniors turn on Bart, but Grampa defends him, saying Bart gave them the best fun they have had in twenty years. However, the springs that Homer flushed down the toilet save them, causing the boat to bounce up at the surface long enough for the Coast Guard to rescue everyone. Bart finishes his community service time, but decides to help the seniors still enjoy themselves.\n\n\"The Old Man and the \"C\" Student\" was directed by Mark Kirkland and was the first episode Julie Thacker wrote for \"The Simpsons\". It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April 25, 1999. The episode's plot was based on a \"disastrous\" school program, in which students had to participate in community service in order to be allowed to advance to the next grade. Thacker, whose oldest daughter was a student at the school, was signed up to do community service at an old folks home in the town they lived in. It became the inspiration for the episode's A-story, while the B-story, which involved Homer selling springs, was conceived by Thacker's husband Mike Scully, an executive producer and the showrunner for the episode.\n\nIn a scene in the episode, Lenny gets one of Homer's springs stuck in his eye. Lenny's eye injuries have since become a running gag, and \"The Old Man and the \"C\" Student\" \"started the trend\", according to Thacker. The \"clunky, Up With People-type\" dance that the students perform for the Olympic jury was partly demonstrated during the animatic by \"Simpsons\" writer George Meyer. When Meyer later watched the episode, he found out, to his \"horror\", that he had been given a choreographer credit at the end of the episode. The episode features American fitness expert Jack Lalanne as himself. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Scully stated that Lalanne was \"very funny\" and that he \"gave a great performance\". Lalanne's lines were recorded separately from the series main cast members.\n\nThe episode title is a reference to the novel and film \"The Old Man and the Sea\". In the beginning of the episode, a sign reading \"International Olympic Committee\" can be seen. The logo below the text parodies the logo of the real International Olympic Committee. Because they did not want to \"upset\" the committee, the \"Simpsons\" staff slightly altered the logo by changing the colors and not making the rings interlock. In a scene in the episode, the old people can be seen watching an edited and over-dubbed version of the 1939 film \"Gone With the Wind\". The nurse that works in the old folks home is based on Nurse Ratched from the American drama film \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". The film is referenced again in a scene where Bart takes the old folks on a boat trip and a scene where a Native American chief in the old folk's home throws a dishwasher through a window, and jumps out, mirroring the last scene in the film. The character then returns, and hands Lisa a pamphlet that reads \"Prop 217\". The pamphlet is a reference to Proposition 217, a proposition that allowed Native Americans to operate casinos in certain states. It is also a reference to the day Scully and Thacker met, which was on February 17. The scene in which Smithers is drawing a portrait of Mr Burns is a reference to the 1997 drama film \"Titanic\". The scene where the old people celebrate their escape from the home is a reference to a sequence from The Beatles 1964 film \"A Hard Day's Night\". Both are set to the group's song \"Can't Buy Me Love\", although in the episode the song is a cover performed by NRBQ. During the end credits, an album cover reading \"A Bart Day's Night\", a reference to The Beatles' album \"A Hard Day's Night\", the film's soundtrack, is shown. \"Can't Buy Me Love\" also plays over the end credits.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on April 25, 1999, \"The Old Man and the \"C\" Student\" received a 6.9 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 6.9 million viewers. The episode finished in 41st place in the ratings for the week of April 19–25, 1999. \n\nOn August 7, 2007, the episode was released as part of \"The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD box set. Matt Groening, Mike Scully, George Meyer, Julie Thacker, Ron Hauge, Nancy Cartwright and Mark Kirkland participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode.\n\nFollowing its home video release, \"The Old Man and the \"C\" Student\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. \n\nAaron Roxby of Collider gave it a positive review, calling it one the season's best episodes. He wrote \"\"The Simpsons\" has always been great about addressing/mocking the way that our culture treats the elderly.\" He added that Lenny's eye injury gave the episode \"Extra points\". \n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\" described the episode as \"A marvellous feel-good story\" and \"Very sweet, very endearing.\" They added that the \"stereotyped Olympic Committee debate\" at the beginning of the episode is \"marvellous\", and concluded by describing the episode as \"terrific\". \n\nColin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide was positive as well, writing \"I gotta admit I like Springy, the Olympic mascot, and the spring-related aspects of the show entertain.\" He added that the story involving Bart \"offer more than a few good moments,\" and concluded by writing \"Though the episode never quite excels, it’s pretty solid.\" \n\nJames Plath of DVD Town called it an \"okay\" episode. \n\nJake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News described the episode as \"not-so-good,\" adding that \"by this point, this show has expended just about every old folks joke there is.\" However, he also wrote that \"'I want some taquitos' never grows old.\"\nThe episode gained attention in 2017 after the French representative of the International Olympic Committee said \"Ah, but Paris would make a tres bon site for the next Olympic Games\", when Paris was chosen to host the 2024 Summer Olympics in the 131st IOC Session that the beginning of the episode scene predicted the future event.\n\n"}

Berenson was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 2005 and the US Hockey Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nBerenson played junior ice hockey with the Regina Pats, participating in two Memorial Cups in 1956 and 1958. In 1959, Berenson played for the World Champion Belleville McFarlands.\n\nBerenson moved on to, and graduated from, Michigan's School of Business and played collegiately at the University of Michigan, winning All-American honors there with an NCAA-leading 43 goals in his final year.\n\nHe signed thereafter with the Montreal Canadiens, playing five years in their system and being on a Stanley Cup-winning squad in 1965 before being traded to the New York Rangers, where he played parts of two seasons without success.\n\nSeven weeks into the 1967/1968 NHL season the St. Louis Blues acquired Red Berenson along with Barclay Plager from the New York Rangers. It was with the Blues where he became one of the new Western Division's first great stars, leading the Blues to three straight Stanley Cup finals and being named the division's best player by his peers in The Sporting News' annual poll each of those years.\n\nHis most notable scoring feat came on November 7, 1968, in a road game against the Philadelphia Flyers. Berenson scored six goals, including four over a nine-minute span. He became the first player to score a double hat trick on a road game. The six-goal total was one shy of the all-time NHL record (set by Joe Malone in 1920), and has been accomplished only once since.\n\nBerenson was named team captain in 1970; however, as he was already 31 years old, the Blues felt his skills could only decline, and traded him in what was considered a shocking deal to the Detroit Red Wings, a multi-player trade receiving centre Garry Unger in return. He was an impact player for Detroit for four seasons, but was having a poor fifth season when he was dealt back to the Blues. The trade rejuvenated him, and he was an effective player for three and a half more seasons before he retired after the 1977–1978 campaign.\n\nBerenson played in the legendary eight-game Summit Series for Team Canada against the Soviet Union in 1972, as well as in the “old-timers” rematch of the Canada Cup in 1987. He played in six NHL All-Star Games.\n\nAltogether, in 17 NHL seasons, Berenson recorded 261 goals and 397 assists in 987 games.\n\nBerenson retired from playing in 1978 and joined the Blues' coaching staff. He became the team's Head Coach midway through the 1979–80 season. A year later, he won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's Coach of the Year. \n\nBerenson returned to his alma mater as Head Coach in 1984 and remained in the position for 33 seasons. He led the Wolverines to 11 Frozen Four appearances, and NCAA championships in 1996 and 1998. In CCHA competition, his teams have won 11 regular-season and 9 tournament titles. In addition, Berenson's squads qualified for the NCAA Tournament for 22 consecutive seasons from 1991 to 2012. This is the longest streak ever in college hockey history. The Wolverines have also won 15 Great Lakes Invitational titles under Berenson.\n\nOn January 10, 2015, Berenson became the fourth coach in Division I men's hockey history reach 800 career wins. Berenson was named the 2015–16 Big Ten Coach of the Year after leading the Wolverines to a 22–7–5 regular-season record, including a 12–5–3–2 record in Big Ten play.\n\nOn April 10, 2017, Berenson announced his retirement as head coach of the Michigan Wolverine men's ice hockey team following 33 years. He finished his career with an 848–426–92 record in 1,366 games, and helped lead Michigan to a record 36 NCAA tournament appearances.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1822480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822480", "title": "Jaime Mayor Oreja", "text": "Jaime Mayor Oreja\n\nJaime Mayor Oreja (born 12 June 1951) is a former Spanish conservative politician of the People's Party. He served as member of the Basque Parliament, of the Spanish Parliament, and of the European Parliament, as well as being Spanish Minister of the Interior between 1996 and 2000. He is known for his outspoken anti-ETA rhetoric and social ultracatholicism\n\nMayor Oreja was born and raised in San Sebastián, in the Spanish Basque Country, where he attended a school run by Marianists. He earned an agricultural engineering degree and briefly studied law before dropping out to enter politics.\n\nMayor Oreja's family is deeply rooted in conservative Spanish politics. His grandfather Marcelino Oreja Elósegui, a Catholic activist and Carlist politician, was a victim of the Asturian strike action of 1934, and his uncle Marcelino Oreja Aguirre served extensively in the Spanish civil service and in the European Parliament. It was Marcelino Oreja who introduced his nephew to politics.\n\nOreja joined the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) in 1977. After failing to be elected in the first democratic elections to the Cortes Generales since Francisco Franco's death, he won a seat with the UCD in the 1979 elections. Shortly after the elections, he was appointed delegate of the Spanish government to the Basque Government. He was also involved in the drafting of the Basque Statute of Autonomy, serving in the Basque General Council, precursor to the autonomous parliament as a minister for tourism.\nHe left the Cortes Generales in 1982 as the Socialist Party won a majority. He kept his position as delegate of the Spanish government to the Basque Government until 1983, when the UCD began to collapse. He joined the People's Coalition, and stood as their candidate for lehendakari in the 1984 Basque elections. Disagreements within the governing party, the Basque Nationalist Party, a snap election was called in 1986. Mayor Oreja then retired from politics.\n\nIn 1989, at the request of Manuel Fraga, Mayor Oreja returned to politics to help the newly founded People's Party (PP). He was the party's candidate in the Basque elections of 1990, and managed the European Parliament elections of 1989, where the party made no significant gains or losses. In 1994, the party nearly doubled its seats. \n\nAfter José María Aznar's win in the 1996 Spanish Parliamentary Elections, Mayor Oreja was appointed Minister of the Interior. Upon entering government, he had to deal with the ETA's kidnapping of José Antonio Ortega Lara. In 1998, ETA declared a ceasefire. Mayor Oreja took a hawkish stance, denouncing the ceasefire as false truce. He famously coined the term \"tregua-trampa\", or \"trap truce\", and he publicly stated his refusal to engage in any political negotiation with ETA. His hard stance against ETA's terrorism earned him over much praise amongst Spanish conservatives.\n\nHis tenure as Minister of the Interior marked Mayor Oreja's height of influence, and thereafter his political career experienced an irregular decline. In 2001, his party chose him as candidate to the Basque regional presidency in that year's election, so he resigned as Minister of the Interior to focus on running the campaign.\n\nThe 2001 Basque elections took place in the aftermath of the collapse of ETA's 1998 ceasefire. Mayor Oreja ran on an aggressive ticket, defending the Spanish Constitution and the Statute of Gernika as the main framework to defeat ETA, and vigorously attacked the incumbent Basque Nationalist Party because Mayor Oreja alleged they were complicit with terrorism. Although his ticket never polled high enough to secure a plurality of seats in the Basque parliament, Mayor Oreja and the Spanish Socialist Party made it clear that were the incumbent lehendakari Juan José Ibarretxe to fail to secure an absolute majority in the Basque parliament, Mayor Oreja would form a minority government instead with the Socialist's support. Albeit Mayor Oreja improved his party's results and attained 22.9% of the votes, this proved insufficient to unseat Ibarretxe, who obtained 42.4% of the votes with a 6.2% swing in his favour. As a result, Mayor Oreja failed to become lehendakari, and Ibarretxe was re-elected.\n\nHe remained leader of the opposition in the Basque country until 2004. During this time, he developed a reputation as an absentee parliamentarian, particularly after missing a key vote in 2002 that enabled the Ibarretxe government to pass its budget by just one vote (Mayor Oreja's).\n\nIn 2004 he was mentioned as a potential successor to the outgoing Spanish prime minister José María Aznar, but the latter finally opted for Mariano Rajoy instead. Shortly afterwards, Mayor Oreja quit his seat in the Basque parliament and ran for MEP in that year's European parliament elections, where he secured a seat. For the next ten years, he occupied several senior positions in the European People's Party group of the European Parliament.\n\nHis position against abortion and LGBT rights, and his hard-line stance against terrorism, placed him at the far right of his party. After a series of public spats with his party's leadership over their strategy in the final days of ETA, Mayor Oreja decided not to run again for the European Parliament in the 2014 election, and largely abandoned public life. Since then, he has chaired the \"Fundación Valores y Sociedad\", an ultraconservative lobby devoted to extending ultra-catholic ideas throughout the Spanish-speaking world. He has since publicly engaged with the defence of what he deems as \"traditional\" values, including positions against gender studies, women's rights, and LGBTQ rights. He has denounced what he deems as the \"moral decadence\" of modern society, and claimed that abortion is something \"\"worthy of bolcheviques\"\", and deployed intense lobbying activity defending these stances in Latin America.\n\n"}

He was the founder of the Gaylord Entertainment Company that included \"The Oklahoman\" newspaper, Oklahoma Publishing Co., Gaylord Hotels, the Nashville Network TV Channel (later renamed \"SpikeTV\",\"Spike\" and Paramount Network after being sold off); the Grand Ole Opry, and the Country Music Television Channel (CMT) as well as the defunct Opryland USA theme park and a bankrupt airline, Western Pacific Airlines.\n\nGaylord was born on May 28, 1919, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. His father, Edward King Gaylord, was the owner of \"The Daily Oklahoman\".\n\nGaylord graduated from Stanford University in 1941, where he earned a degree in business. He attended the Harvard Business School and served in the United States Army during World War II.\n\nGaylord began his career for Oklahoma Publishing in 1946. He inherited a controlling interest in \"The Daily Oklahoman\" upon his father's death in 1974. He purchased the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, when it was in dire financial straits and kept it operating. He created The Nashville Network TV Channel, as well as Country Music Television, or CMT, which is similar to MTV, and owned Hee Haw, a long-running country and western variety show. He was also an investor in Texas Rangers at the same time as George W. Bush. Gaylord served as the chairman of the Gaylord Entertainment Company until February 2003.\n\nGaylord was the president of the Southern Newspaper Publishers Association. He also served on the board of directors of the American Newspaper Publishers Association. As the publisher of \"The Oklahoman\", he consistently took conservative political positions in opposition to government spending, but at the same time the paper was sometimes accused of improperly dealing with conflicts of interests created by Gaylord's personal financial interests. One example was the paper's editorial support for the city to use public funds to promote the building of a new Bass Pro Shop in Oklahoma City, while Gaylord Entertainment was then a 19.9% shareholder of Bass Pro stock. \"The Oklahoman\"'s reporting on this topic again drew criticism from the \"Columbia Journalism Review\". He was also a member of the conservative public policy think tank, Council for National Policy.\n\nThe Gaylord family of Oklahoma City helped found the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City and has given the University of Oklahoma contributions totaling over $50 million in the last three decades, and founded the Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communication. The home field of the University of Oklahoma Sooners football team was renamed Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium due to their contributions.\n\nGaylord had several children, including Edward King Gaylord II, Mary Gaylord McClean, Louise Gaylord Bennett and Christy Gaylord Everest.\n\nGaylord died of cancer on April 27, 2003, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. His funeral was held at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.\n\nThe \"Daily Oklahoman\" remained being controlled by the family until the sale in 2012; the news features and editorial position of the paper reflect affiliation with \"The Washington Examiner\", which has the same owner. His daughters remain as board members along with his sister, Louise Gaylord Bennett. Both sought an updated look for the paper and seemed to present more frequent opposing viewpoints of issues of public concern.\n"}

It contains a large, natural harbor, Pago Pago Harbor, where Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa, is situated. Pago Pago International Airport is also located on Tutuila. Its land expanse is about 68% of the total land area of American Samoa and with 56,000 people accounts for 95% of its population. The island has six terrestrial and three marine ecosystems.\n\nThe mountainous regions (highest point at ) of the island, its beaches, coral reefs, World War II relics, and the sporting activities such as scuba diving, snorkeling and hiking activities make it attractive to tourists.\n\nThe origin of the name may relate to a couple named Tutu and Ila, whose daughter Salaia combined the names of her parents. After her, the island is also known as 'o le motu o Salaia or motu sā.\n\nA popular island legend is that, upon the issuance of a particular call, a shark and a turtle will appear. The underlying story is that, in order to escape the pangs of starvation, a blind old lady and her granddaughter jumped off a cliff in the village of Vaitogi, into the roiling ocean below. According to this legend, they were reborn as a shark (old lady) and a turtle (young girl). In support of this legend, the villagers utter a particular chant by which the shark and the turtle promptly make an appearance.\n\nAnother Samoan legend is the Flying Fox, found in the National Park of American Samoa in Tutuila. The belief is that the Flying Fox (a type of bat) is the protector guardian of the forest, and its people.\n\nThe Polynesians first reached Samoa at about 1000 BC. By 600 BC, they had established a settlement on Tuta at Tula. They built up a settlement at Tula. Over the centuries, the Samoans kept in contact with the neighboring islands of Western Polynesia, Tonga and Fiji.\n\nIn 1722, Jacob Roggeveen became the first European to visit the Manu'a islands and in 1768 the islands of Samoa were named the \"Navigator Islands\" by Louis Antoine de Bougainville because of the fact that the islanders used canoes offshore to catch tuna. Whalers and Protestant missionaries began to arrive in the early 19th century, particularly in the 1830s, including John Williams of the London Missionary Society. Apia, rather than Pago Pago developed as a trading station. Louis de Freycinet arrived in October 1819 and named Tutuila Rose Island after his wife Rose de Freycinet.\n\nIn 1872, the Pago Pago Harbor was recognized by the Americans as the ideal refueling station for the new San Francisco to Sydney steamship service. In 1872, the US Navy negotiated a treaty on Tutuila to use the island but the U.S. Congress didn't ratify it until 1878. Due to competing interest from Great Britain and Germany which began to emerge in the 1860s, in 1879 the Americans formed a tripartite government of the islands after the Samoans declared that they are open to all of them.\n\nThe Berlin Conference of 1889 was held to discuss the political future of the islands but, by 1899, American dissatisfaction of not having complete control led to a division of the Samoan islands, with Tutuila and Aunu'u forming American Samoa. The Samoans signed the agreement in 1900 and the Flag of the United States was raised on Tutuila on April 17, 1900. It was not until 1929, though, that it was formally ratified and the name of American Samoa was not given formally until 1911.\n\nDuring World War II, Tutuila was an important island for the US Marines under Colonel Lester A. Dessez in the Pacific and they erected many concrete bunkers along the coastline. The island, given that it was such an important base went relatively unscathed during the war, except for an attack from a Japanese submarine on January 11, 1942. Since 1951, the island and American Samoa has been the responsibility of the Department of the Interior.\nIn 1956 Peter Tali Coleman became the first Samoan-born governor and during his term protection for the islanders against the alienation of their lands and loss of culture was approved in 1960 and subsequently the Flag of American Samoa became official. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed H. Rex Lee and generated massive funds to develop Tutuila, financing the building of an international airport, port facilities, roads, schools, houses, a hospital, a tuna cannery, a modern hotel and installing electricity throughout the 1960s. This massive development came at the exact time that the political future of American Samoa was uncertain given that Western Samoa became independent of New Zealand in 1962 and effectively stamped American authority over Tutuila as a dependency.\n\nIn July 1997 Western Samoa, by legal agreement, changed the country's name from Western Samoa to Samoa. This was opposed by the Americans, including the American Samoan islanders who believed that the name diminished their sense of identity and still use the terms Western Samoa and Western Samoans.\n\nToday American Samoa is an unincorporated and unorganized territory of the US but is under the administration of the Office of Insular Affairs of the US Department of the Interior. Politically, the island is divided into two of American Samoa's primary divisions, the Eastern District and the Western District.\n\nTutuila lies in the Pacific Ocean, roughly northeast of Brisbane, Australia. The village of Fagatogo is situated northeast of Suva, Fiji. The island lies roughly north of Niue and roughly south of Tokelau and roughly southeast of the Samoan island of Upolu.\n\nTutuila is a fairly small and narrow island, measuring roughly across and little more than from north to south at its widest point. The area of this volcanic island of early Pliocene age is with a shore line of . The hill range which runs from west to east is rugged and winding with the northern coast line having steep cliffs and unusual coast line. However, the southern part of the island has flatter terrain. Good beaches are located at many places along the coast. It has a wet tropical climate. The highest point in the Tutuila island is the Matafao Peak which is at an elevation of , which is highest peak in the island. There is trail opposite to the Mount Alava peak () which dominates the northern part of the island. This trail is approached by a metal stairway from the southern end which goes right up to the peak. Trekking along the ridge through the rain forests without any additional support system, the scenic beauty of the South Pacific Ocean provides a delightful sight.\nIn the early 19th century, navigators passed through the Tutuila, the westward island among the Samoan group of Islands (one of the four islands called as navigators islands), when it was also known by the names of Bougainville, Manuo or Maouna. Midway between this islet and the rock the navigators sighted the Pago Pago harbor, which was marked by \"a conical hill on its western side and a flat elliptical topped hill to the eastward.\" Leone village, large and prosperous, was sighted to the west of the island. To the south-east of the island is the Aunu'u islet.\n\nThe coastal road runs for a length of from Fagamalo in the northwest to Onenoao in the far northeast. Important towns and villages now developed in the island are as follows: the Tafuna Urban area, the largest urban area in the territory, encompasses a string of villages from 'Ili'ili to Tafuna proper; Fagatago, the largest town with government offices functioning from Utulei (both are urban centers located to the northeast of Pago Pago); Pago Pago (a deep harbor that divides the island into two parts), the harbor town opposite to Fagatago; the Vatia village on the northern coast known for its famous beach and scenic setting, which is also a coral fringed bay; and Leone, a safe anchorage station in the past where the Europeans and Samoans first started their interaction in the early years of the island's history. The southwestern-most settlement is Taputimu, the western-most settlements are Poloa and Amanave, the northern-most settlement is Vatia and the eastern-most settlement is Tula.\n\nThe island has population of 55,876 (2000 census) (These figures include Aunu'u Island, off the southeast coast of Tutuila, which has a land area of and a population of 476).\n\nThe economy of American Samoa is dominated by grants from the U.S. Department of Interior. The tuna canning and fishing industries provide the majority of the GDP, although tourism is a promising developing sector. Economic activity is strongly linked to the US with which American Samoa conducts most of its commerce, although American Samoa does not treat the US as an external trade partner. Funding from the US government adds substantially to American Samoa's economic well being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Hurricanes are relatively infrequent and although they sometimes cause substantial damage, the total number of deaths from hurricanes in the past 50 years is estimated to be less than 5. Therefore, hurricanes are simply an inconvenience and certainly not the economic development curtailing events portrayed in many writings.\n\nMore than 90% of the land is communally owned. Tuna fishing and tuna processing plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the primary export. Urban development has taken roots in Pago Pago Harbor where fisheries and its allied industries of canneries have been established. The largest Tuna processing plant in the world, known as StarKist, is located in Atu'u, across the bay from Fagatogo. In the harbor there is a workshop of the Marine Railways, which takes care of the maintenance and repair of fishing ships.\n\nThe island has six terrestrial and three marine ecosystem. There are two protected areas in the island namely, the National Park covering an area of and the Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary of area.\n\nFlora in the island is dominated by lowland and montane rain forests. The lowland rain forest at elevation less than is dominated by \"Diospyros\", \"Dysoxylum\", \"Pometia\" and \"Syzygium\" species. The montane forest in the elevation range of consists of \"Dysoxylum\", montane scrub, streams, bushes, mangroves, mangrove lagoons, reefs and submerged coral banks.\n\nThere are 19 species of land snails in the island out of which 11 are endemic and four are in the threatened category. Mt. Matafao, which has many species of snails, has been researched from this angle since 1917; some of the endemic snails reported here are the Diastole matafaoi (endemic and may be extinct) and Samoana abbreviata (short Samoan tree snail, \"Partulidae\"). \"Achatina fulica\" (giant African land snail) introduced in 1975 is reported to have damaged gardens. Two different species of flying fox (bats) have also been found on the island (described under National Park).\n\nHard corals recorded are 174 species of 48 genera and sub-genera.\n\nThe bird species recorded are under endemic category. These are: The \"Aplonis atrifuscus\" (Samoan starling) group; the \"Gymnomyza samoensis\" (black-breasted honeyeater) group; \"Halcyon recurvirostris\" (flat-billed kingfisher); \"Lalage sharpei\" (Samoan triller); \"Myiagra albiventris\" (white-vented flycatcher); \"Pachycephala flavifrons\" (yellow-fronted Samoan whistler); and \"Rhipidura nebulosa\" (Samoan fantail).\n\nFour species of native doves and pigeons are also recorded in all the islands of Samoa. The four species are: Pacific imperial pigeon (\"Ducula pacifica\"), the crimson-crowned fruit dove (\"Ptilinopus porphyraceus\"), many-colored fruit dove (\"Ptiliopus persousii\") and shy ground dove (\"Galicolumba stairi\").\n\nButterflies are another category of avifauna in the island. The recorded species are: the \"Hypolimnas thompsoni\" and \"Papilio godeffroyi\" (butterfly).\n\nThe National Park of American Samoa in Tutuila was established in 1988 for preserving its perfect terrestrial and marine environment. It covers an area of and is bound on the north coast between Fagasa and Afono villages. The Rainmaker pass is located within this park with its rain forests. The Amalau Valley between the Afono and Vatia villages in the park has many species of birds and animals. The most significant faunal species consists of the two species of the flying fox (bats), which the local Samoans consider as the protector guardian of the forest and also its people.\n\nThe two species of flying foxes (bats) protected in the park are: \"Pteropus samoensis\" (known locally as \"pe'a voa\") meaning \"fruit bat of the forests\" and \"Pteropus tonganus\" locally called \"pe'afaunua\", which means \"fruit bat of settled lands\"; The roosting place of \"Pteropus samoensis\" (with prominent light colored face with brown body) is the canopy of ridge top trees, which roost alone or in small groups and are active during day time with two feeding peaks, the \"Pteropus tonganus\" (with black colored face with seal brown body) species roost in large groups (100 or more in numbers in each group) in thick forest habitat, also sometimes seen close to villages. Both species have a wing span of at adulthood, and weigh about 500 grams.\n\nThe park which is divided into three zones has a network of hiking trails. The National Park Service (NPS) maintains good information system about these trails. One such trail goes up the Mount Alava, a high peak within the park rising to a height of . A TV tower exists on this mountain and also the ruins of a cable car station of a long cable way which once ran over Pago Pago Harbor to Solo hill in Utulei. (524m). This cable way, which was the only single way cable in the world at that time built in 1965, was damaged when a Navy plane attempted to fly under it and was caught by one of the cables, on April 17, 1980 and was permanently put out of commission. The cable way was used to transport the TV technicians to the transmission station. The descent from the peak passes through lovely vistas of the lowlands of the park and the rain forests which abounds in several bird species. Another ridge trail runs from Fagasa Pass over a length of , goes through a very steep slopes behind the rest \"fale\" (hurricane shelter), which is also negotiated through a stairway and further leads down to the serene Vatia village on the coral bay.\n\nHurricanes or tropical cyclones have been frequently striking the Samoan Island for centuries. To monitor and give advance warning of the cyclones, several Observation stations have been established under the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in American Samoa. After the first recorded hurricane (at least in modern times) hit the Samoan islands on February 10, 1966, which was declared a major disaster, \"hurricane homes\" called as \"fale afa\" have been built in the islands for people to take shelter during cyclonic storms. After the hurricane in 1966 the islands have witnessed many disasters due to heavy rains, hurricanes and drought; due to drought in 1974, due to floods, mudslides and landslides in 1979; and due to hurricanes in 1981, 1987, 1990, 1991 and 2004; and a tsunami in 2009.\n\nThe hurricane of December 4–13, 1991 was the worst disaster faced by entire group of Samoan Islands which was named \"Hurricane Val,\" which caused immense damages to property in the American Samoa and Western Samoa. The Hurricane Val in comparison to past hurricanes, was very severe and the storm force had a wind velocity of over 100 knots or /hour. It was reported as the worst in 100 years in its intensity of wind force and the severity of the damage caused in the island. According to the history of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) American Samoa observatory, \"Hurricane Val\" struck the Tutuila Island from December 7 – 10th. The hurricane's eye passed over the southern end of the island with winds as high as recorded at the observatory. In the Fagatele Bay of the Tutuila Island where the Hurricane Val made a direct pass over Tutuila the coral reef was completely destroyed, a large strip of the coast was also eroded.\n\nIn response to this disaster, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) dispatched an assessment team to survey the damage to the reefs. Apart from the cable way which was severely damaged and went permanently out of commission, the TV tower at Utulei, one of the three TV channels, was completely damaged by Val, resulting in its cannibalization to maintain the two remaining channels. The Fagalele Boys School, which was one of the oldest European style buildings built in the middle of the 19th century on the west coast of the island in Leone village, was also destroyed by Hurricane Val.\n\nAt Utulei, at Blunts Point there are two guns of World War II vintage dated to 1941, which are seen in the form of two metal tubes projecting from a wall. The guns are seen at two levels, the lower gun is above a green water tank. The second gun is located above the first gun above the ridge. Both guns are accessible through a staircase made of concrete. In addition, two more guns of identical dimensions are also seen fixed at the harbor mouth at a strategic location to create a cross fire. Concrete bunkers used during WWII are also seen at Pago Pago.\n\nNotable buildings in Fagatogo are the Governor's Mansion (1903), Sadie's Restaurant where Somerset Maugham stayed in 1916 and wrote the short story \"Rain\" about former prostitute Sadie Thompson (that takes place in American Samoa), the Fono Building which is the state legislative building, the Jean P. Haydon Museum built in 1917, which was once the navy headquarters and Catholic Cathedral with painting of a Holy Family scene at the beach. Also seen are the Zion Church (1900) at Leone, the old capital of Tutuila and the monument in front of the church erected in honor of John Williams, the first missionary to visit Tutuila in 1832, the Radio Towers at Mt. Olotele, the Massacre Bay in Aasu village where a monument has been installed in 1883 with stone cross to honor of the 11 French sailors only who were members of the Astrolabe and Boussole ships during the La Parouse expedition who were killed by the local Samoans in a clash on December 11, 1787; 11 Chinese and 39 Samoans also died in this conflict but are not mentioned in the honor list.\n\nAt the defunct cable car terminal on the Solo Hill in Utulei there is a monument built in honor of the six US Navy personnel who died in the plane crash which occurred as a result of hitting the cableway and crashed into the Rainmaker Hotel; two tourists staying in the hotel also died in the crash.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1822517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822517", "title": "Telefe", "text": "Telefe\n\nTelefe (acronym for Televisión Federal) is a television station located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The station is owned and operated by ViacomCBS through Televisión Federal S.A. Telefe is also a television network and one of Argentina's five national television channels.\n\nTelefe has an international signal (Telefe Internacional) which is available in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Oceania.\n\nThe history of Telefe stretches back to 1957, when a group of alumni and lawyers from the Colegio El Salvador led by Fr. Héctor Grandetti, founded the company \"Difusión Contemporánea S.A.\" (Contemporary Broadcasting S.A.). This company, known as DiCon for short, submitted a bid in the licensing of two new TV channels in Buenos Aires, one on channel 11 and one on channel 13. On April 28, 1958, DiCon won the license for channel 11.\n\nOriginal plans to construct the new station in Colegio El Salvador facilities fell through. Eventually, facilities were secured, and with the window to sign on air coming to a close, Canal 11 took to the air on July 21, 1961.\n\nFinancial problems forced the station to seek a backer, which would turn out to be ABC in the United States. ABC and DiCon formed Telerama S.R.L., a group that allowed DiCon to upgrade and expand its studio facilities.\n\nIn this era, the first mascot of the station, now known as Teleonce, came about: Leoncio, an anthropomorphic lion.\n\nOn October 17, 1970, businessman Héctor Ricardo García took over the station. Under his leadership, Teleonce went for a populist and news-oriented direction, adopting the slogan \"El canal de las noticias\" (\"The News Channel\"). Under García, Teleonce would climb to the top of the Argentine TV ratings.\n\nChanges began in 1973, when the second government of Juan Perón took control of the news departments of channels 9, 11 and 13. Jorge Conti was named administrator and took over hosting duties for the newscast and other programs. This was followed in 1974 with the expropriation of all three networks; Conti became the administrator once again. This continued under the military dictatorship of the National Reorganization Process, with the Argentine Air Force co-administrating the channel with Conti, who remained lead newsreader.\n\nIn 1979, with the arrival of color television looming and facilities upgrades needed to allow color recording and broadcasting, the state bought the Teleonce plant from García, who had continued to own it, thus becoming a 100 percent nationally owned network. It would not be until 1987, with the 11-month run of Teledos, that García would manage another television network.\n\nThe 1980s started with the introduction of color telecasts on May 6, 1981, but the decade would become turbulent in the legal system. Twice under the dictatorship, a request for bids was issued. The first one, on August 19, 1982, received no offers; the second, on October 25, 1983, would result in Canal Once being handed back to Garcia. At that time, however, Raúl Alfonsín became President of Argentina. Among his first acts in office was to nullify the transfer of Canal Once to García, leaving it in the hands of the state for another six years.\n\nAs the 1980s began to close, financial problems and hyperinflation had brought Canal Once to its breaking point. The energy crisis that helped bring down Alfonsín's presidency had forced massive cuts in TV broadcast hours in Buenos Aires; with the ability to broadcast only four, later eight and ultimately ten, hours a day, and amidst the already rough economic backdrop, Canal Once teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. The closure of the station was being batted around at this time. However, salvation came when Carlos Menem announced that he would seek bids to privatize two of the state's three remaining Buenos Aires stations, Canal Once and Canal 13. One of the groups participating in this bidding process was Televisión Federal S.A., a group whose stakeholders were headlined by Editorial Atlántida as a group of privately owned TV stations from interior Argentina.\n\nIn December 1989, Arte Radiotelevisivo Argentino (Artear), a subsidiary of Grupo Clarín, won the bidding for Canal Once, but it had also won the bidding for Canal Trece. Artear chose the latter, and Televisión Federal took control of Canal Once on January 15, 1990. After 16 years of state management, the station was back in the hands of the private sector, and after a decade of branding as Canal Once, the new branding of Telefe, an acronym of the new ownership's name, was rolled out, with its first idents being the station name in blue on a white background (reflecting the colors of the Flag of Argentina) with the iconic station theme music and identification voiceover: \"Broadcasting from Buenos Aires, Telefe. LS 84 TV, Channel Eleven, Argentine Republic.\"\n\nTelefe's arrival into the 90s was signaled with the debut of its iconic 3 circles logo with the station name in white in 3 colored circles (TE on Blue, LE on green and FE on Red) but still retaining the ident theme and the iconic voiceover until 1991 with the arrival of nationwide satellite broadcast. The voiceover has changed to \"Telefe, broadcasting with its proper satellite across the country. LS 84 TV, Channel Eleven, Buenos Aires, Argentine Republic.\"\n\nWith Gustavo Yankelevich (and after 1999, Claudio Villaruel) directing the channel's output, and with the introduction of satellite broadcasts nationwide, Telefe took to an unprecedented 20-year streak atop the Argentina ratings. It logged ratings wins in every year between 1990 and 2009, acquiring the rights to \"The Simpsons\", Formula 1 racing and the franchise for \"Big Brother\".\n\nIn 1999, Telefónica acquired ownership of Telefe and its eight owned-and-operated stations; that same year, Telefe launched an international signal aimed at viewers outside of Argentina. It also retained Telefe over Azul Televisión when it bought the latter in 2002. COMFER, Argentina's radio and television watchdog, forced Telefónica to sell off its involvement in Azul.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, under the direction of Marisa Badía, Telefe lost its number one position in the ratings—which had not happened since just after the privatization of the station—to El Trece. In 2012, however, another change in management, this time to Gustavo Yankelevich's son Tomás, and shows like \"Graduados\", \"Dulce amor\" and \"Pekín Express\" helped Telefe return to the top of the ratings list.\n\nOn November 3, 2016, it was reported that Viacom had won a bid to acquire Telefe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

G. Wells in 1913. The book, which had a full title of Little Wars: a game for boys from twelve years of age to one hundred and fifty and for that more intelligent sort of girl who likes boys' games and books, provided simple rules for miniature wargaming. Although first printed in 1913, an updated version was released in 2004. \n\nIt is mentioned in one of Wells' other books, \"Joan and Peter\", where, during the Great War, a sensitive young man named Bunny Cuspard tries his best to compare his life in the army as a larger version of the manual.\n\n\"Little Wars\" included fairly simple rules for infantry, cavalry, and artillery in the form of a toy 4.7 inch gun that launched projectiles, usually small wooden dowels to knock down enemy soldiers. In addition to its being a war game, the book hints at several philosophical aspects of war.\n\nThe book is written in a whimsical style and illustrated with amusing drawings and photographs of a game being played that Wells describes in the book. Wells also gives a description of the game from the view of one of the generals in the battle bombastically relating his memoirs.\n\nThe development of the game is explained and Wells's thoughts on war, as he was known to be a pacifist, are revealed in his writing. According to Wells, the idea of the game developed from a visit by his friend Jerome K. Jerome. After dinner, Jerome began shooting down toy soldiers with a toy cannon and Wells joined in to compete. The two decided that with an addition of written rules, a good Kriegsspiel type game could be developed. The game revolved around the use of lead hollow cast soldiers made by W. Britain and battlefields made from whatever materials were on hand, usually blocks or other toys. Simple rules of movement, firing, and close combat were developed with a set amount of time for each player to move and fire. Wells also provides a chapter of \"Extensions and Amplifications of Little War\". In an appendix, Wells provides \"Little Wars and Kriegspiel\"; more complex rules to be played in a larger space involving military logistics, military engineers, cavalry charges, and railway transport of troops.\n\n\"Little Wars\" was first published in 1913 by Frank Palmer. \"Little Wars\" was republished in its unabridged form by Da Capo Press in 1977. There have been numerous other reprints and it is now available online at Project Gutenberg, along with a previous game book by Wells called \"Floor Games\" (1911). A 2004 edition of the book published by Skirmisher Publishing includes an introduction by game designer Michael O. Varhola and a foreword by Gary Gygax.\n\nC. Ben Ostrander reviewed the 1977 unabridged version of \"Little Wars\" in \"The Space Gamer\" No. 17. Ostrander commented that \"There are many line drawings and photos of the author 'at play'. Although it is of little use to the modern gamer, this book stands as an interesting volume.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1822539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822539", "title": "Zemsta", "text": "Zemsta\n\nZemsta \"(Revenge)\" is a Polish comedy by Aleksander Fredro, a Polish poet, playwright and author active during Polish Romanticism in the period of partitions. \"Zemsta\" belongs to the canon of Polish literature. It is a play in four acts, written in the octosyllabic verse mostly in the vernacular of Lesser Poland (Małopolska); filled with proverbs and paraphrased allusions.\n\nReal events inspired Fredro to write the play. In November 1828, Fredro married Zofia Jablonowska, whose dowry included the title to half of a castle located in Odrzykoń in the province of Galicia. In 1829, when looking through the archives of the castle, Fredro came across some old court records related to a dispute dating from the 17th century between the owners of the castle's two halves - Jan Skotnicki and Piotr Firlej. The conflict was long and relentless. It ended after more than thirty years with the marriage of Firlej's son to Zofia Skotnicka, an end similar to that adopted by Fredro in his play.\n\nThe play premiered in Lviv on 17 February 1834, with Jan Nepomucen Nowakowski playing Cześnik and Witalis Smochowski playing Rejent.\n\nTwo families live in the same castle - Cześnik Raptusiewicz and his niece Klara as well as Rejent Milczek and his son Wacław. Cześnik and Rejent consider each other enemies and do not get on. Cześnik, who administers Klara's lands until she comes of age, is eager to marry a wealthy wife. After a brief consideration of Klara, he settles on the widow Hanna, thinking that she is richer. Although generally of a forthright and brave characters, Cześnik is shy around women, and so sends Papkin, a show-off, to propose to Hanna (called Podstolina because she is the widow of a civil servant) and to be a go-between with Rejent for him. Podstolina herself is looking for a husband because her supposed wealth is only temporary - she is administering it for Klara, her kinswoman, and so agrees to marry Cześnik.\n\nRejent has hired some bricklayers to fix a wall that segregates his part of the castle from the half of the castle in which Cześnik lives. Cześnik does not approve of this and sends Papkin to shoo them away, offering them however payment for their work being interrupted. \n\nKlara, niece of Cześnik, and Wacław, son of Rejent are in love and secretly meeting up. They despair of ever being allowed to marry due to their families' dislike of each other. Wacław proposes that they run away together, but Klara refuses. In order to be close to her, Wacław presents himself as an employee of the Regent and gives himself up as a hostage to Papkin, supposedly caught up in the struggle over the wall.\n\nWacław makes an unsuccessful attempt to convince Cześnik to reconcile with his father. Cześnik declares that it would sooner come about that the sun would stop in place and the water dry out of the seas than he and Rejent would have peace. Wacław bribes Papkin to let him stay and agrees with Klara to convince Podstolina, just that day engaged to Cześnik, to intervene on their behalf. When Wacław meets with Podstolina, it turns out that she is a former lover of Wacław, to whom he had presented himself untruthfully as a prince. Despite this, Podstolina decides that she prefers Wacław to Cześnik. \n\nPapkin declares his love for Klara. Klara, who does not love him, demands impossible things of him as 'proof' of his sentiments - to spend half a year in silence, to survive on bread and water for just over a year, and to bring her a crocodile. \n\nCześnik wants to duel with Rejent and sends Papkin over to arrange this.\n\nRejent Milczek prepares to raise a legal action against Cześnik. He convinces the bricklayers that the very minor scratches that they suffered count as wounds and that they have been deprived of work (because he himself will not pay them). Wacław comes to ask him to allow him to marry Klara. Instead, Rejent announces that he must marry Podstolina, providing an agreement that whichever one of them breaks it off will have to pay the other 100 thousand. \n\nPapkin arrives with a letter from Cześnik inviting Rejent for a duel. Papkin drinks some wine he criticises. Although he starts off bragging, deceived by Rejent's unassuming manner, he begins to be greatly afraid and can barely issue the challenge, after being threatened with being thrown out of the window and the placement of four servants outside the door. Podstolina comes in with the agreement of marriage to Wacław, which she has signed. Papkin finds out that she has jilted Cześnik. Papkin gets thrown down the stairs.\n\nPapkin comes back from Rejent and brags about his courage. Cześnik suggests that the wine he drank was poisoned. Papkin falls into a panic and, thinking himself poisoned, writes his testament. Cześnik is informed of Podstolina's change of mind. He dictates a letter to Dyndalski that is supposed to come from Klara, but eventually decides to send a servant for him instead. Wacław arrives and is given the choice between being imprisoned or marrying Klara. Wacław and Klara are surprised but happy and get married: a priest is already waiting in the chapel. \n\nRejent comes to Cześnik. He had turned up at the place Cześnik had set up for the appointed duel, but Cześnik himself did not turn up. He is angry to hear of Wacław's marriage to Klara. Podstolina explains that all her wealth is in fact Klara's and by virtue of her marriage is given over to Klara. Klara promises to pay 100 thousand to Podstolina out of her own money. Rejent and Cześnik reconcile. \n\n\nThe play serves as the basis for the opera \"Zemsta za mur graniczny\" (\"Revenge for the Boundary Wall\") by Zygmunt Noskowski.\n\nThe play was adapted into a 2002 film, directed by Andrzej Wajda, featuring Janusz Gajos, Andrzej Seweryn (as \"Rejent Milczek\") and Katarzyna Figura among others. Notably, the original story took place in Kamieniec castle, which is currently located in Odrzykoń, while the movie was filmed in Ogrodzieniec castle, located in Silesia province, Poland.\n"}

He was also a Danish Navy officer and \"lensmann\" bailiff.\n\nHans Ulrik was born at the Kronborg castle in Helsingør, Denmark, on 10 March 1615. He was given \"Gyldenløve\" [Golden Lion] as his surname by his father. It was the traditional surname for the illegitimate children of the Kings of Denmark in the 17th Century. The King also appointed Ernst Normand as the guardian of his son. Hans Ulrik was educated, along with his older half-brother Christian Ulrik, with Jens Dinesen Jersin as their teacher and, for a time, in Sorø in Zealand, Denmark. In 1629 Hans went with another half-brother, Duke Frederik, the future King Frederick III of Denmark, to France. He was also given the royal estate of Vindinge (now , not far from Sorø) in Zealand.\n\nWhile the King was making a courtier and diplomat out of Christian Ulrik, he thought that the future for his other son would be in the Royal Navy. So Hans Ulrik was sent in 1634 to Karen Andersdatter's brother-in-law in Copenhagen, Laurits Andersen Hammer, the grocer, for his apprenticeship in the shipping yards. In 1635 he was made a \"Hofjunker\" [Gentleman of the Court]. In 1636, he was sent on one ship to Ireland and another ship to the Weser River in Germany. When he came back, he was appointed to the \"Kammerjunker\" [Gentleman of the Chambers].\n\nHans lived at the Frederiksborg until 1640, when its elderly commander died, and he had to move out. On his way to the Kronborg, he visited numerous inns and brothels, where he virtually “robbed” them of women, food and drink. Ten days later, his father received from a certain innkeeper a bill totaling almost two thousand \"rigsdaler\", which had not been paid by Hans.\n\nIn 1640, Hans Ulrik became an \"unteradmiral\" (Rear admiral) aboard the ship “\"Norske Løve\"” [Norwegian Lion]. He was given the order to bring the Danish Ambassador, Hannibal Sehested, aboard the “\"Norske Løve\"” to Spain. When they arrived in Spain, Hans Ulrik was supposed to immediately return to Denmark and resume his studies. But he was never serious about them. Dr. Otto Sperling, the physician who was on that trip to Spain, wrote that Hans Ulrik had “\"intet Hoved eller Ingenium derail\"” [neither the head or the wit]. Instead, Hans Ulrik went ashore at Corunna with the Ambassador and had a very good time at the Court of King Philip IV in Madrid. But he paid the price; his body, never robust, could not tolerate the excesses. At one time, he was glistening with his sweat so much that the women thought that he had his face painted. Then he had an epileptic seizure right after the bullright. Apparently he had inherited his father’s appetite for women, food and drink but not his health. So Sehested had to send Hans Ulrik home to Denmark. Hans Ulrik was back in Copenhagen in the spring of 1641.\n\nNevertheless, Hans was appointed in 1641 as the \"lensmann\" [bailiff] of the three castles, the Kronborg, the Frederiksborg, and the Abrahamstrup (now the Jægerspris Castle). To his duties, the island of Hven, then a part of Denmark, was added in 1642, when his mother died, but he had already been on the island’s board of directors as an overseer on her behalf.\n\nFrom 1641 until his death, Hans was the commander of his birthplace, the Kronborg. But his health was still delicate. He often had epileptic seizures. He was once warned by Dr. Sperling that, if he did not control his appetites, he would have a stroke. But dropsy killed him at the Kronborg on 31 January 1645, two months short of his 30th birthday. He was buried at the \"Vor Frue Kirke\" [The Church of Our Lady], the National and Royal Cathedral of Denmark in Copenhagen, but, by 1889, his tombstone was destroyed.\n\nOn 10 October 1641, Hans married Regitze Grubbe (1618-1689). She was the daughter of Jørgen Grubbe and his wife Lene Knudsdatter Rud of Tostrup and Hageløs, both members of the Danish ancient nobility, and was a granddaughter of the statesman Eiler Grubbe. She was also a relative of Erik Grubbe of Tjele, the father of Marie Grubbe. But she and Hans Ulrik never had any children.\n\nAfter her husband’s death, his widow inherited Hven as her estate but, in 1654, she traded it for an annual pension of 1,000 \"dalers\". She moved her household to Esrum Monastery on the island of Zealand in 1647 but, in 1661, she was living at House No. 12–16 on Østergade in Copenhagen. Six years later, she won the lawsuit against the heirs of a certain Ruderne over the burials at the \"Vor Frue Kirke\" but, in 1678, she was accused of complicity in the attempted murder of the Countess Parsberg and banished to the island of Bornholm for the rest of her life. She died there in 1689.\n\nA portrait of him, painted by Karel van Mander III, hangs at the Rosenborg Castle. At the [\"Frederiksborgmuseet\"], there is a large painting that shows a couple dancing, in clothes from the medieval times, at the (a medieval monastery in Rygge, Norway, southeast of Oslo). The models for this couple are believed to be Hans Ulrik Gyldenløve and his wife, Regitze.\n\nGyldenløve Fjord in East Greenland was named after him by Lieutenant W. A. Graah in 1829.\n\n\n\n"}

While at the game, he wrote his idea on a 9x12 envelope from his briefcase with sketches of the field and notes on gameplay. He presented the idea to a few friends at the NFL offices, where he received praise and encouragement for his concept. After solidifying the rules and business plan, supplemented with sketches by a professional artist, Foster presented his idea to various television networks; he reached an agreement with NBC for a \"test game\".\n\nIn 1998, CBS assumed the broadcast rights to the American Football Conference (AFC) rights from NBC, ending the network's 38-year tenure with the NFL (a relationship it would forge again in 2006 when it acquired the rights to the Sunday Night Football package from ESPN). CBS had previously lost the television rights to the National Football Conference (NFC) to Fox in 1994, a situation that exacerbated CBS' struggles in the ratings. In 2000, NBC declined to renew its broadcast agreement with Major League Baseball. In 2002, it was additionally outbid by ESPN and ABC for the NBA's next broadcast deal, ending the league's twelve-year run on NBC.\n\nDuring this era, NBC experimented with broadcasting emerging sports. In 2001, the network partnered with the World Wrestling Federation to establish the XFL – a new football league which introduced modified rules and debuted to tremendous, but short-lived fanfare, only lasting one season. In 2003, NBC obtained the broadcast rights (on a revenue sharing basis) and a minority interest in the Arena Football League. In conjunction with this, the league moved the beginning of the season from May to February (the week after the NFL's Super Bowl) and scheduled most of its games on Sunday afternoons instead of Friday or Saturday evenings as it had in the past. These moves were directly marketed to those seeking more football after the Super Bowl ended; advertisements for NBC's arena football coverage dubbed this phenomenon \"post-Super Bowl stress disorder, or \"pissed\"\" (thus openly using one of the seven dirty words). The network televised weekly games on a regional basis, as well as the entire playoff slate. The deal lasted four years, after which the league and NBC parted ways.\n\nPromotions for the network's AFL game telecasts featured famed former NFL player John Elway, accompanied by the song \"Rumble\" by Bon Jovi, the band fronted by Philadelphia Soul owner Jon Bon Jovi, with the lyrics \"Come on feel the thunder. There's a rumble in the house!\" The song was featured on the band's CD \"There's A Rumble In The House!,\" which was published by NBC sister company Universal Music Group.\n\nFor the 2006 season, the AFL struck a cable agreement with OLN (now NBC Sports Network) to broadcast 11 weekly regular-season games and one Wild Card playoff game. However, the agreement was not renewed and was later picked up by ESPN, which also acquired a minority ownership stake in the league.\n\nThe network's broadcast of ArenaBowl XX in 2006 earned NBC a considerably disappointing 0.7% of the U.S. households; the small audience for the 2006 ArenaBowl was the culmination of a season that earned NBC 0.9% of the U.S. households. This was down from the inaugural 2003 season of \"The AFL on NBC\", which earned a 1.1% share; in contrast, even at its lowest, the XFL, which aired in 2001, was drawing 1.6% of U.S. households for its NBC broadcasts.\n\nNBC's coverage received sharp criticism from some longtime AFL fans and owners such as Jon Bon Jovi. The complaints were mostly because the network had severely cut back from their initial promotion of the AFL in 2003 and 2004, to barely promoting it at all in 2005 and 2006. NBC also tended to massively advertise select teams such as the Philadelphia Soul, Chicago Rush, Colorado Crush and the Dallas Desperados, while smaller-market teams such as the Austin Wranglers, San Jose Sabercats, Grand Rapids Rampage and the then-Columbus Destroyers were massively underpromoted or not broadcast at all.\n\nIn 2006, due to the XX Winter Olympic Games, the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and the Daytona 500, NBC reduced its coverage of AFL games from weekly broadcast to scattered coverage during the regular season, albeit with an extensive playoff schedule ending with ArenaBowl XX. For that season, some games were moved to OLN, now known as NBC Sports Network (eleven regular-season games and one playoff game).\n\nOn June 30, 2006, the Arena Football League and NBC Sports failed to reach an agreement to extend their broadcasting contract, ending the network's association with the AFL after four years. League commissioner David Baker said regarding the end of the partnership, \"NBC has been a great partner. We are forever grateful to them for exhibiting our game with the utmost respect and integrity. We wish them well, but are also excited to begin a new chapter that will continue our unprecedented growth.\" NBC Sports president Ken Schanzer responded, \"Unfortunately we were unable to reach an agreement. We've enjoyed our partnership with the Arena Football League. It's a great game with great people. We wish them all the best.\" In an interview with \"The New York Times\", NBC spokesman Mike McCarley stated, \"we gave Arena Football our best effort, with top production and significant promotion, but the ratings never grew.\"\n\nDuring an August 2006 segment of Larry King's interview with owner Jon Bon Jovi, a new deal was hinted at being in development, one that would be superior to its previous agreement with NBC. In December 2006, a deal was struck with ABC/ESPN to broadcast AFL regular season and playoff games. ESPN also assumed partial ownership of the league itself. Las Vegas Gladiators owner Jim Ferraro stated during a radio interview that the reason why a renewed deal with NBC failed was because ESPN refused to show highlights of the games or even mention a product being broadcast on NBC.\n\nThe pre-game, halftime and post-game studio show was anchored by Al Trautwig and analyst Glenn Parker throughout its run. In 2003, Michael Irvin also provided studio analysis, but that role was subsequently filled with guest analysts, including Ray Bentley, Danny White, Tommy Maddox and Kurt Warner.\n\nGame commentary was provided by two major teams, with the lead consisting of play-by-play announcer Tom Hammond and analyst Pat Haden, with sideline reporter Lewis Johnson; this team also served as NBC's lead analyst team for its Notre Dame football coverage at the time. The secondary announcing team included Bob Papa (play-by-play), Ray Bentley (analyst) and Marty Snider (sideline reporter). NBC's NASCAR announcers Bill Weber and Allen Bestwick also called games, as did Alabama Crimson Tide football voice Eli Gold. Other broadcasters included color commentators Mike Pawlawski and Charles Davis, and sideline reporter Steve Wrigley.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1822603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822603", "title": "Cointegration", "text": "Cointegration\n\nCointegration is a statistical property of a collection of time series variables. First, all of the series must be integrated of order \"d\" (see Order of integration). Next, if a linear combination of this collection is integrated of order less than d, then the collection is said to be co-integrated. Formally, if (\"X\",\"Y\",\"Z\") are each integrated of order \"d\", and there exist coefficients \"a\",\"b\",\"c\" such that is integrated of order less than d, then \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" are cointegrated. Cointegration has become an important property in contemporary time series analysis. Time series often have trends—either deterministic or stochastic. In an influential paper, Charles Nelson and Charles Plosser (1982) provided statistical evidence that many US macroeconomic time series (like GNP, wages, employment, etc.) have stochastic trends. \n\nIf two or more series are individually integrated (in the time series sense) but some linear combination of them has a lower order of integration, then the series are said to be cointegrated. A common example is where the individual series are first-order integrated () but some (cointegrating) vector of coefficients exists to form a stationary linear combination of them. For instance, a stock market index and the price of its associated futures contract move through time, each roughly following a random walk. Testing the hypothesis that there is a statistically significant connection between the futures price and the spot price could now be done by testing for the existence of a cointegrated combination of the two series.\n\nThe first to introduce and analyse the concept of spurious—or nonsense—regression was Udny Yule in 1926.\nBefore the 1980s, many economists used linear regressions on non-stationary time series data, which Nobel laureate Clive Granger and Paul Newbold showed to be a dangerous approach that could produce spurious correlation, since standard detrending techniques can result in data that are still non-stationary. Granger's 1987 paper with Robert Engle formalized the cointegrating vector approach, and coined the term.\n\nFor integrated processes, Granger and Newbold showed that de-trending does not work to eliminate the problem of spurious correlation, and that the superior alternative is to check for co-integration. Two series with trends can be co-integrated only if there is a genuine relationship between the two. Thus the standard current methodology for time series regressions is to check all-time series involved for integration. If there are series on both sides of the regression relationship, then it's possible for regressions to give misleading results.\n\nThe possible presence of cointegration must be taken into account when choosing a technique to test hypotheses concerning the relationship between two variables having unit roots (i.e. integrated of at least order one). The usual procedure for testing hypotheses concerning the relationship between non-stationary variables was to run ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions on data which had been differenced. This method is biased if the non-stationary variables are cointegrated.\n\nFor example, regressing the consumption series for any country (e.g. Fiji) against the GNP for a randomly selected dissimilar country (e.g. Afghanistan) might give a high R-squared relationship (suggesting high explanatory power on Fiji's consumption from Afghanistan's GNP). This is called spurious regression: two integrated series which are not directly causally related may nonetheless show a significant correlation; this phenomenon is called spurious correlation.\n\nThe three main methods for testing for cointegration are:\n\nIf formula_1 and formula_2 are non-stationary and Order of integration d=1, then a linear combination of them must be stationary for some value of formula_3 and formula_4 . In other words:\n\nwhere formula_4 is stationary.\n\nIf we knew formula_3, we could just test it for stationarity with something like a Dickey–Fuller test, Phillips–Perron test and be done. But because we don't know formula_3, we must estimate this first, generally by using ordinary least squares, and then run our stationarity test on the estimated formula_4 series, often denoted formula_10.\n\nA second regression is then run on the first differenced variables from the first regression, and the lagged residuals formula_11 is included as a regressor.\n\nThe Johansen test is a test for cointegration that allows for more than one cointegrating relationship, unlike the Engle–Granger method, but this test is subject to asymptotic properties, i.e. large samples. If the sample size is too small then the results will not be reliable and one should use Auto Regressive Distributed Lags (ARDL).\n\nPeter C. B. Phillips and Sam Ouliaris (1990) show that residual-based unit root tests applied to the estimated cointegrating residuals do not have the usual Dickey–Fuller distributions under the null hypothesis of no-cointegration. Because of the spurious regression phenomenon under the null hypothesis, the distribution of these tests have asymptotic distributions that depend on (1) the number of deterministic trend terms and (2) the number of variables with which co-integration is being tested. These distributions are known as Phillips–Ouliaris distributions and critical values have been tabulated. In finite samples, a superior alternative to the use of these asymptotic critical value is to generate critical values from simulations.\n\nIn practice, cointegration is often used for two series, but it is more generally applicable and can be used for variables integrated of higher order (to detect correlated accelerations or other second-difference effects). Multicointegration extends the cointegration technique beyond two variables, and occasionally to variables integrated at different orders.\n\nTests for cointegration assume that the cointegrating vector is constant during the period of study. In reality, it is possible that the long-run relationship between the underlying variables change (shifts in the cointegrating vector can occur). The reason for this might be technological progress, economic crises, changes in the people's preferences and behaviour accordingly, policy or regime alteration, and organizational or institutional developments. This is especially likely to be the case if the sample period is long. To take this issue into account, tests have been introduced for cointegration with one unknown structural break, and tests for cointegration with two unknown breaks are also available.\n\n\n"}

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 2, 1999. In the episode, Mr. Burns is jealous of megastore owner Arthur Fortune, who is beloved by the people of Springfield. In order to win the people's love, Burns gathers the help of Homer Simpson, Professor Frink and Groundskeeper Willie to capture the Loch Ness monster.\n\nThe episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Mark Ervin. The idea for the episode was pitched by the \"Simpsons\" writing staff, who wanted to make an episode in which Mr. Burns becomes a \"thrillionaire\", a millionaire who goes on thrilling adventures. Although it would originally be green, a mistake in the overseas animation led to the Loch Ness monster looking pink, a mistake that was ultimately too expensive to fix.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Monty Can't Buy Me Love\" was seen by approximately 7.26 million viewers, and finished in 43rd place in the ratings the week it aired. Following the release of \"The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season\", the episode received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nOn a normal afternoon, Marge wants Homer, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie to go for a walk. They agree when faced with the threat of having to talk to each other, and arrive at a Fortune Megastore, a venture of wealthy Arthur Fortune (modelled on British entrepreneur Richard Branson). Fortune easily charms the crowd and hands out dollar bills to his customers. This embarrasses the unpopular Mr. Burns, who asks Homer to help him be loved by all.\n\nAs his first activity, Burns has Homer throw silver dollars from the top of a tall building, which instead of winning him popularity just causes injuries and terrifies the crowds below. Next, he writes out a check and tells Homer to donate it to the Springfield Hospital, but Homer is mistakenly believed to be the donor and receives the credit. Burns appears on a radio show called \"Jerry Rude and the Bathroom Bunch\" and is mocked by Rude. Feeling disappointed, Burns decides to go to Scotland to capture the legendary Loch Ness Monster with help from Homer, Professor Frink and Groundskeeper Willie. After little progress, Burns has the loch drained of water to expose the creature. After subduing the monster single-handed (although it is not shown, it is mentioned that the monster swallowed him), Burns has it sent to Springfield to be unveiled, where \"Nessie\" turns out to be friendly and charms all of the spectators.\n\nHowever, during the unveiling of the monster, Burns is blinded by camera flashes. He runs into a camera, which crashes and starts a fire: the crowd panic and flee. Following this disaster, Homer then cheers up Burns by pointing out that being loved means you have to be nice to people everyday but being hated means you do not have to do anything, to which Burns agrees. In the end, Homer and Burns give Nessie a job at the \"Vegas Town Casino\".\n\n\"Monty Can't Buy Me Love\" was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Mark Ervin. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 2, 1999. The inspiration for the episode came from the concept of \"thrillionaires\", a term the \"Simpsons\" writers found in an issue of \"The Economist\" to describe millionaires who \"do really incredible stunts\" and \"go on amazing adventures\". The episode's third act went through several incarnations, and the writers had a lot of ideas about what Burns should do once he has captured the Loch Ness monster. Eventually, the staff settled on the act's current iteration, which was conceived by \"Simpsons\" writer George Meyer. According to current showrunner Al Jean, the color of the Loch Ness monster would originally be green, but when the overseas animation was completed, the Loch Ness monster had a \"kind of pinkish\" color. Because it would be too expensive to re-color all the cels in which the monster appears, the staff decided to air the episode as it was, even though the monster was in the wrong color. Inside the Fortune Megastore, \"Simpsons\" staff writer Ian Maxtone-Graham can be seen.\n\nThe episode features American comedian and composer Michael McKean as Jerry Rude, a parody on the radio personality Howard Stern. Scully stated that McKean was \"very funny\" and that his Stern impression was \"dead on the money\". The \"Simpsons\" staff originally asked Stern if he wanted to guest-star in the episode, but he declined. Actor and producer Kevin Costner was portrayed by series regular cast member Hank Azaria, who voices Moe Szyslak among other characters in the series. Azaria also played Arthur Fortune, a character based on British business magnate Richard Branson. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Scully stated that Branson would have been a \"great guest[-actor]\" in the episode. The episode also features Groundskeeper Willie's father, even though Willie in an earlier episode said that he was killed for stealing a pig.\n\nIn the beginning of the episode, the Simpsons watch a television program called \"Cash in Your Legacy\", which is a parody on the PBS program \"Antiques Roadshow\". Arthur Fortune is a parody of Branson and Fortune Megastore is a reference to Branson's international record shop chain Virgin Megastores. On the cover of \"Billionaire Beat\", a magazine that Burns reads in the episode, business magnates Bill Gates and Rupert Murdoch can be seen. In a scene in the episode, Burns assumes that \"\"Don McNeill and his Breakfast Club\"\" is currently the most popular radio program. \"Don McNeill's Breakfast Club\" was a real radio program that, according to Scully, Swartzwelder used to listen to. Costner's film \"The Postman\" is also referenced in the episode. Burns' unveiling of the Loch Ness Monster is ruined as the numerous camera flashes blind him, causing him to knock over some lights, starting a fire. This is a reference to the film \"King Kong\", although in the film the flashes enrage the captured gorilla Kong, as opposed to his captor.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on May 2, 1999, \"Monty Can't Buy Me Love\" received a 7.3 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 7.26 million viewers. The episode finished in 43rd place in the ratings for the week of April 26 – May 2, 1999. On August 7, 2007, the episode was released as part of \"The Simpsons – The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD box set. Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Ron Hauge and Matt Selman participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode.\n\nFollowing its home video release, \"Monty Can't Buy Me Love\" received mixed reviews from critics. Giving the episode a positive review, Currentfilm.com considered it to be \"one of the best Mr. Burns-centric episodes ever\", and that it has \"some classic Burns moments, especially when Monty describes exactly what it took for him to capture the creature.\" Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide stated that, while the episode \"doesn’t do a lot to expand the character\", it \"manages a reasonable number of yuks\". He added that \"A fun Howard Stern-esque character done by Michael McKean helps make this a nice show.\" David Plath of DVD Town wrote that the episode has \"Some funny moments\". Giving the episode a mixed review, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\" said that the episode is \"Very funny when it's funny, very poor when it isn't.\" They wrote that the best part of the episode is \"the Scottish stuff,\" and \"the idea that, once again, Burns is actually worried about his public image, as he was in 'The Joy of Sect'.\" Jake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News gave the episode a negative review, and wrote that \"the story takes too long to get going\".\n\n"}

Her extensive work in musical theater includes starring in Broadway productions of \"Coco\" (1969), \"Over Here!\" (1974), \"Goodtime Charley\" (1975), \"Chicago\" (1977), \"Dancin'\" (1978) and \"Sweet Charity\" (1986). In the 1996 revival of \"Chicago\", she reprised the role of Roxie Hart and was also the choreographer, winning the Tony Award for Best Choreography. For the 2000 West End production of \"Fosse\", she won the Olivier Award for Best Theatre Choreographer. She has also appeared in the films \"All That Jazz\" (1979), \"Annie\" (1982), and \"Micki & Maude\" (1984).\n\nReinking was born in Seattle, Washington, the daughter of Frances (née Harrison) and Walter Reinking. She grew up in the suburb of Bellevue. As a child, Reinking began ballet lessons, studying with former Ballets Russes dancers Marian and Illaria Ladre in Seattle.\n\nReinking made her professional performing debut at the age of 12 in a production of \"Giselle\" with the English Royal Ballet. \n\nReinking moved to New York City at age 18, and danced as a member of the corps de ballet at the Radio City Music Hall, performed in the ensemble of the second national tour of \"Fiddler on the Roof\", and at the age of 19 made her Broadway debut in the musical \"Cabaret\". She was a chorus dancer in \"Coco\" (1969), \"Wild and Wonderful\" (1971), and \"Pippin\" (1972). During \"Pippin\", she came to the attention of the show's director and choreographer Bob Fosse. Reinking became Fosse's protégée and romantic partner, an affair that continued even as Fosse was still legally married to (though separated from) Gwen Verdon at the time.\n\nIn 1974, Reinking came to critical notice in the role of Maggie in \"Over Here!\", winning a Theatre World Award. She starred as Joan of Arc in \"Goodtime Charley\" in 1975, receiving Tony Award and Drama Desk nominations for Best Actress in a Musical.\n\nIn 1976, she replaced Donna McKechnie as Cassie in \"A Chorus Line\"; in 1977, she replaced Verdon in the starring role of Roxie Hart in \"Chicago\", a show directed and choreographed by Fosse. In 1978, she appeared in Fosse's revue \"Dancin'\", and received another Tony nomination.\n\nIn that year, Reinking and Fosse ended their romance and separated. They continued to have a professional, creative collaboration. Reinking has acknowledged Fosse as the major influence on her work as a choreographer.\n\nIn 1979, Reinking appeared in Bob Fosse's semi-autobiographical film \"All That Jazz\" as Katie Jagger, a role loosely based on her own life and relationship with Fosse.\n\nReinking remained in Hollywood for several years after \"All That Jazz\", and appeared in two more feature films, \"Annie\" (as Grace Farrell) and \"Micki & Maude\" (as Micki).\n\nIn March 1985, Reinking appeared at the 57th Academy Awards to give a mostly lip-synced vocal performance accompanied by a dance routine of the Academy Award-nominated Phil Collins single \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)\". The routine was poorly received by critics from the \"Los Angeles Times\" and \"People\", as well as by Collins himself in a \"Rolling Stone\" interview.\n\nIn 1986, she returned to Broadway, replacing Debbie Allen in a successful revival of Fosse's production of \"Sweet Charity\". In 1991, she appeared in her first theater production following the birth of her son, the Broadway National Tour of \"Bye Bye Birdie\", costarring Tommy Tune. In 1992 she contributed choreography to \"Tommy Tune Tonite!\", a three-man revue featuring Tune.\n\nReinking founded the Broadway Theater Project, a Florida training program connecting students with seasoned theater professionals, in 1994. In 1995, she choreographed the ABC television movie version of the Broadway musical \"Bye Bye Birdie\".\n\nReinking had retired from performing by this time. In 1996, she was asked to create the choreography \"in the style of Bob Fosse\" for an all-star four-night-only concert staging of \"Chicago\" for City Center's annual Encores! Concert Series. When the producers could not obtain a suitable actress for the role of Roxie Hart, Reinking agreed to reprise the role after almost 20 years. This concert staging of \"Chicago\" was a hit, and a few months later the production (in its concert staging presentation) was produced on Broadway, with the Encores! cast: Reinking, Bebe Neuwirth, Joel Grey, James Naughton, and Marcia Lewis. In November 2016 the revival celebrated its 20th year, and as of at least September 2017 it is the longest-running American musical on Broadway. The revival of \"Chicago\" won numerous Tony Awards, and Reinking won the Tony Award for Best Choreography. She recreated her choreography for the 1997 London transfer of \"Chicago\", which starred Ute Lemper and Ruthie Henshall.\n\nIn 1998, she co-created, co-directed and co-choreographed the revue \"Fosse\", receiving a Tony Award co-nomination for Best Direction of a Musical. For her work on the West End production of \"Fosse\", Reinking (along with the late Bob Fosse himself) won the 2001 Olivier Award for Best Theatre Choreographer.\n\nIn 2001, she received an honorary doctorate from Florida State University for her contribution to the arts.\n\nReinking served as a judge of annual New York City public school dance competitions for inner-city youth, and appeared in \"Mad Hot Ballroom\", the 2005 documentary film about the competition. In 2012, she contributed choreography for the Broadway production of \"An Evening with Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin\". She has served as a member of the advising committee for the American Theatre Wing.\n\nReinking has been married four times, first in 1970 to Larry Small. Following their divorce, she married investment banker Herbert Allen Jr. on August 25, 1982; they divorced in 1989. Next she was married in 1989 to businessman James Stuart, with whom she had one child, son Christopher, before their divorce in 1991. Reinking has been married since 1994 to sportswriter Peter Talbert, and is stepmother to Leslie, Christie, Herbert, and Charlie.\n\n, Reinking lives primarily in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nReinking's son Chris has Marfan syndrome, and Reinking works with the Marfan Foundation, which is dedicated to raising awareness of the disease.

Bremerholm is present-day a riverside neighborhood of downtown Copenhagen.\nAndersdatter's father was Anders Hansen Wincke, a secretary from Bremerholm in Copenhagen. Andersdatter's mother was Bodil Knudsdatter Skriver. \nAndersdatter's maternal uncle was Antonius Knudson (ca 1564–1614), the \"rådmann\" [councilman] (1607) and borgermester (mayor) (1611–1614) of Oslo.\n\nWhen Andersdatter met the King of Denmark for the first time, she was said to have been already engaged to a pastor named Niels Simonsen Glostrup. But Christian IV fell in love with her. In the beginning of 1613, the King swept Andersdatter away from a wedding feast to his castle, where they danced away the night. Andersdatter became his mistress and bore him one short-lived daughter, Dorothea Elisabeth Gyldenløve (1613-1615) and a son, Hans Ulrik Gyldenlove (1615-1645). \nAndersdatter's former fiancé, in the meantime, married her sister, Anna, and became the Bishop of Oslo two years later and he would hold his position until his death in 1639.\n\nBut, after more than three years at the court, Andersdatter, probably because of the marriage the King had made with Kirsten Munk. However, he arranged to have Andersdatter endowed with the island of Hven (then a part of Denmark, but now, with the name of Ven, a part of Sweden, in the Øresund) and an annual pension. He was said to have also given Andersdatter a couple of mansions in Copenhagen.\n\nIn 1640, there were rumors at the court that Andersdatter was planning to marry a university student by the name of Niels Nelausen. When the king heard the news, he was not pleased. The King confiscated Hven from Andersdatter and tried to get a hold of her, “\"Junker Snarensvend\"” [Lady Sweet Snare]. The engagement had to be abandoned but that did mollify the King. He raised her annuities and even commanded, shortly before his death, they would be provided by the Royal Treasury. Although the subsequent investigation upheld his decision, she found it hard, in the following economic difficulties, to get her money, which did not come for several years. So she suffered great distress. Perhaps, as compensation, she was, for a brief time, on the Board of Directors for the Danish island of Møen (now Møn, then a Royal possession south of Copenhagen, in the Baltic Sea. In 1664 she called the island “\"Forvalterske\"” [Management].\n\nA family tradition tells that an eye surgery in 1653 restored her sight after she had been deprived of it for 37 years, but there may be reasons to doubt the reliability of this report.\n\nIn 1673, Andersdatter died in Copenhagen. Andersdatter was buried next to her daughters at the \"Sankt Nicolai Kirke\" [St. Nicholas Church] in Copenhagen. A portrait of her is said to have hung inside this church as late as 1779 but it is apparently now lost, probably to the fire of 1795 that almost destroyed the church. \nHven was afterwards passed to her only surviving child, Hans Ulrik Gyldenløve.\n\n\n\n"}

It can be done intentionally by laboratory personnel or by cells, or can occur spontaneously. Spontaneous or accidental DNA fragmentation is fragmentation that gradually accumulates in a cell. It can be measured by e.g. the Comet assay or by the TUNEL assay.\n\nMen with sperm motility defects often have high levels of sperm DNA fragmentation.\nThe degree of DNA fragmentation in sperm cells can predict outcomes for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and its expansion intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The sperm chromatin dispersion test (SCD) and TUNEL assay are both effective in detecting sperm DNA damage. Using bright-field microscopy, the SCD test appears to be more sensitive than the TUNEL assay.\n\nIts main units of measurement is the DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI). A DFI of 20% or more significantly reduces the success rates after ICSI.\n\nDNA fragmentation was first documented by Williamson in 1970 when he observed discrete oligomeric fragments occurring during cell death in primary neonatal liver cultures. He described the cytoplasmic DNA isolated from mouse liver cells after culture as characterized by DNA fragments with a molecular weight consisting of multiples of 135 kDa. This finding was consistent with the hypothesis that these DNA fragments were a specific degradation product of nuclear DNA.\n\nDNA fragmentation is often necessary prior to library construction or subcloning for DNA sequences. A variety of methods involving the mechanical breakage of DNA have been employed where DNA is fragmented by laboratory personnel. Such methods include sonication, needle shear, nebulisation, point-sink shearing and passage through a pressure cell.\n\n\nApoptotic DNA fragmentation is a natural fragmentation that cells perform in apoptosis (programmed cell death). DNA fragmentation is a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. In dying cells, DNA is cleaved by an endonuclease that fragments the chromatin into nucleosomal units, which are multiples of about 180-bp oligomers and appear as a DNA ladder when run on an agarose gel. The enzyme responsible for apoptotic DNA fragmentation is the Caspase-activated DNase. CAD is normally inhibited by another protein, the Inhibitor of Caspase Activated DNase (ICAD). During apoptosis, the apoptotic effector caspase, caspase 3, cleaves ICAD and thus causes CAD to become activated.\nCAD cleaves the DNA at the internucleosomal linker sites between the nucleosomes, protein-containing structures that occur in chromatin at ~180-bp intervals. This is because the DNA is normally tightly wrapped around histones, the core proteins of the nucleosomes. The linker sites are the only parts of the DNA strand that are exposed and thus accessible to CAD.\n\nDNA Fragmentation plays an important part in forensics, especially that of DNA profiling.\n\n"}

Gusts of an estimated 138 mph. hit the northwest coast. Buildings, barns, and fences were destroyed. The storm blew a three-masted schooner onto the beach at Coos Bay where it broke in two.\n\nOn January 19, 1880, a letter to \"The Daily Oregonian\" from an Astoria resident reads,\nFrom the graphic, and, in some cases, the heart-rending accounts published in the Oregonian descriptive of the disasters resulting from the late severe windstorms in other portions of the state and the neighboring territory, it would appear that our town and county suffered less injury than almost any other.\n\nParts of the lower Columbia seem to have experienced a blizzard, as related from Westport:\nOn the 9th at 2 o-clock P.M., a storm of snow and wind set in and continued for two hours with all the fury of a hurricane.\n\nAs documented in the \"Morning Oregonian\", Polk County reported \"the heaviest wind storm ever known in these parts\" and the Dallas \"Itemizer\" said \"The storm of Friday was considered very severe here at that time, but since the reports of the havoc in other places, we have concluded that we had no storm here to speak of.\"\n\nAn article printed on January 12, 1880 noted,\nThe storm near the mouth of the Columbia seems to have been entirely distinct from the one which swept through the Willamette Valley, and scarcely as severe or prolonged. The wind was from the northwest, and did not commence to blow violently until nearly 2 o'clock Friday afternoon.\n\nIn the Fort Clatsop area along the Lewis and Clark River, it was reported \nThe wind changed suddenly to the west, and while the trees were heavily laden with snow, struck the forest with terrific effect.\n\nIn contrast to the north coast, a letter from Newport printed in \"The Oregonian\" on January 17, 1880 reported\nWe have just experienced one of the severest gales; nothing like it has occurred since the settlement of the bay. It was southeast, lasted about five hours, and was terrible in force… The tide rose seven feet higher than was ever known; nearly all the old wharves are taken away.\n\nThere was no snowfall on the coastal hills around Newport, but \"several miles from here it is five inches, and gradually deepens as you go east. Said to be 18 inches deep at Siletz, Oregon.\" Further south, it was reported on January 19 that Gardiner was struck with a \"perfect gale\" that threw large breakers ashore and shoved water into a warehouse, threatening livestock. \"The rain came down in torrents,\" and the Umpqua River and Smith River flooded high, adding to the wet mess. \"The storm raged with great violence at Coos Bay.\" The three-masted schooner \"Emma Utter\" dragged anchor and was smashed ashore. \n\nThe powerful gale struck much of the Willamette Valley in the mid to late morning. For example, \"the heaviest windstorm ever known in these parts\" struck Monmouth, in Polk County, at about 11 AM. The strong winds also struck the city of Corvallis at 11 AM, with the gale lasting until about 3 PM, and started around 9 AM in Blodgett in the coast range to the west. In Portland, the powerful wind began at 11 AM, and lasted until about 2:30 PM.\n\n\n"}

Founded under the auspices of Dean Wallace Donham, \"HBR\" was meant to be more than just a typical school publication. \"The paper [\"HBR\"] is intended to be the highest type of business journal that we can make it, and for use by the student and the business man. It is not a school paper,\" Donham wrote. Initially, \"HBR\"s focus was on macroeconomic trends, as well as on important developments within specific industries.\n\nFollowing World War II, \"HBR\" emphasized the cutting-edge management techniques that were developed in large corporations, like General Motors, during that time period. Over the next three decades, the magazine continued to refine its focus on general management issues that affect business leaders, billing itself as the \"magazine for decision makers.\" Prominent articles published during this period include \"Marketing Myopia\" by Theodore Levitt and \"Barriers and Gateways to Communication\" by Carl R. Rogers and Fritz J. Roethlisberger.\n\nIn the 1980s, Theodore Levitt became the editor of \"Harvard Business Review\" and changed the magazine to make it more accessible to general audiences. Articles were shortened and the scope of the magazine was expanded to include a wider range of topics. In 1994, Harvard Business School formed Harvard Business Publishing (HBP) as an independent entity. Between 2006 and 2008, HBP went through several reorganizations but finally settled into the three market-facing groups that exist today: Higher Education, which distributes cases, articles, and book chapters for business education materials; Corporate Learning, which provides standardized on-line and tailored off-line leadership development courses; and Harvard Business Review Group, which publishes \"Harvard Business Review\" magazine and its web counterpart (HBR.org), and publishes books (Harvard Business Review Press).\n\nIn 2009, HBR brought on Adi Ignatius, the former deputy managing editor of \"Time\" magazine, to be its editor-in-chief. Ignatius oversees all editorial operations for Harvard Business Review Group. At the time that Ignatius was hired, the U.S. was going through an economic recession, but \"HBR\" was not covering the topic. \"The world was desperate for new approaches. Business-as-usual was not a credible response,\" Ignatius has recalled.\n\nAs a result, Ignatius realigned HBR's focus and goals to make sure that it \"delivers information in the zeitgeist that our readers are living in.\" \"HBR\" continues to emphasize research-based, academic pieces that would help readers improve their companies and further their careers, but it broadened its audience and improved reach and impact by including more contemporary topics.\n\nAs part of the redesigned magazine, Ignatius also led the charge to integrate the print and digital divisions more closely, and gave each edition of \"HBR\" a distinct theme and personality, as opposed to being a collection of academically superlative, yet mostly unrelated articles.\n\nHarvard Business Review won the 2020 Webby Award for Business Blog/Website in the category Web.\n\nSince 1959, the magazine's annual McKinsey Award has recognized the two most significant \"Harvard Business Review\" articles published each year, as determined by a group of independent judges. Past winners have included Peter F. Drucker, who was honored seven times; Clayton M. Christensen; Theodore Levitt; Michael Porter; Rosabeth Moss Kanter; John Hagel III; and C.K. Prahalad.\n\n"}

It is regarded as the city's symbol and one of the area's most-visited attractions. It was dedicated in 1871 and is the centerpiece of Fountain Square, a hardscape plaza at the corner of 5th and Vine Streets in the downtown area. It is surrounded by stores, hotels, restaurants and offices. Originally, and for more than 130 years, it was located in the center of 5th Street (Fountain Square's original configuration), immediately west of Walnut Street. In 2006, renovations were undertaken to Fountain Square and the Tyler Davidson Fountain was temporarily removed. When reinstalled it was relocated to a much wider space near the north end of the reconfigured square, closer to the Fifth Third Bank Building and away from street traffic. The fountain is turned off for the winter months and turned on again in time for the first home game of Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds.\n\nThe fountain is cast in bronze and sits on a green granite base. The inscription \"To the People of Cincinnati\" appears on its base.\n\nThe artistic fountain's motif is water, in homage the river city's continuing debt to the Ohio River. The central figure, the Genius of Water—a female in heroic size—pours down the symbolic longed-for rain from hundreds of jets pierced in her outstretched fingers. The figure is 9 feet high and weighs 2 tons.\n\nThe pedestal itself is square with four representations in \"basso-relievo\" of four principal uses of water; namely, steam, water-power, navigation, and the fisheries. The first is typified by workers in iron using a trip hammer powered by an engine in the background; the second, by peasants carrying corn to a watermill; the third, by a steamboat leaving the shore, lined by numbers waving farewell; the fourth, by groups of fishermen and children.\n\nFrom the center of the pedestal rises a shaft spread at the top with interlaced vines and foliage and about these are four groups. On the north is a workman standing upon a burning roof and imploring the aid of water; at the south is a farmer standing in the midst of a field where are plainly seen the effects of a drought—he too is praying for rain. Upon these two groups the Genius of Water is dropping a gentle spray. At the west a young girl is offering the water to an old man with crutches. On the east side a mother partially nude is leading her naked and reluctant boy to the bath.\n\nFour outer figures with animals represent the pleasures of water. These are working drinking fountains from which passersby can drink. On the drinking fountains are figures of nude boys—one riding a dolphin, another playing with ducks, a third struggling with a snake and the fourth on the back of a turtle.\n\nThe construct is made of approximately of cannon bronze purchased from the Danish government and of granite.\n\nAfter the death of his brother-in-law and business partner Tyler Davidson, Cincinnati businessman Henry Probasco went to Munich, Germany in search of a suitable memorial to him. Many years before, artist August von Kreling had collaborated with Ferdinand von Miller at the Royal Bronze Foundry of Bavaria to design a fountain to rival the great fountains of Europe but which would glorify mankind rather than fanciful creatures and mythic deities. When Miller could find no patron to sponsor the fountain, the designs languished until Probasco came to him with an interest in a similar theme. Probasco requested the addition of four figures with animals that would act as drinking fountains, which Miller's sons Ferdinand and Fritz designed. The original miniature model is now located in the Cincinnati Art Museum.\nThe fountain was cast in separate sections at the foundry and shipped to Cincinnati for assembly. Probasco requested that the City of Cincinnati remove the dilapidated market along 5th Street between Vine and Walnut Streets for the fountain. In its place an esplanade bisecting 5th Street was built, the designer was architect William Tinsley. Tinsley had also designed the Henry Probasco House in the suburb of Clifton. The esplanade made the fountain easily visible to anyone traveling by. Miller traveled to Cincinnati for the dedication ceremony, which took place on October 6, 1871, it is estimated that 20,000 people were present. Miller and Von Kreling enjoyed a degree of celebrity in the city.\n\nThe fountain originally faced east, toward Europe, where much of Cincinnati's population originated. When Fountain Square was redone in the late 1960s, the fountain was realigned to face west. With the newest rendition of Fountain Square, the fountain faces to south since it is on the edge of the square.\n\nThe fountain was renovated for the first time in 1970 for a celebration of its centennial. The Fountain Square plaza was also redesigned for better traffic flow, and the fountain was moved and turned to face west rather than east. Additional repairs and another refurbishing project was undertaken in 1999. In 2005, as part of Fountain Square's revitalization, the city decided to move the entire fountain to the center of Fountain Square. The estimated cost was approximately $42 million. The city was responsible for $4 million. During the renovation the fountain was on display at the Cincinnati Art Museum.\n\nFountain Square reopened on October 14, 2006 with an elaborate ceremony that included different stages for multiple bands, food, beer and fireworks. The fountain continues to be a backdrop for various cultural events in Cincinnati: movie nights, game shows, and the ice rink which opens in the winter.\n\nThe fountain is most familiar to non-Cincinnati residents for being featured in the opening credits (at its former location) of the television series \"WKRP in Cincinnati\". It can also be seen in the montage that accompanies the opening narration for the paranormal investigation series \"Ghost Adventures\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1822747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822747", "title": "Alan Sonfist", "text": "Alan Sonfist\n\nAlan Sonfist is a New York City based American artist best known as a \"pioneer\" and a \"trailblazer\" of the Land or Earth Art movement.\n\nHe first gained prominence for his \"Time Landscape\" found on the corner of West Houston Street and LaGuardia Place in New York City's Greenwich Village. Proposed in 1965, \"Time Landscape\" the environmental sculpture took over ten years of careful planning with New York City. It was eventually landmarked by the city. It has often been cited as the first urban forest of its kind. More recently, Sonfist has continued to create artworks within the natural landscape, inaugurating a one-acre (4,000 m²) landscape project titled \"The Lost Falcon of Westphalia\" on Prince Richard's estate outside Cologne, Germany in 2005.\n\nIn Nature: The End of Art, environmentalist Jonathan Carpenter writes that \"To review the public sculptures of Alan Sonfist since the 1960s is to witness the reemergence of the socially aware artist. His sculptures reassert the historical role of the artist as an active initiator of ideas within society. Each of his artworks fundamentally redefine what sculpture is, who the artist is, and how art should function for its public.\"\n\nSonfist was raised in the South Bronx. His work derives from an early childhood anxiety towards deforestation. As the Financial Times writes: \"One of the pioneers of environmental art, Sonfist's passion for nature was triggered by his childhood nearby a hemlock forest, which has now died. 'I watched it disappear as people tried to improve upon it,' he tells me sadly. A gentle soul in a pinstriped suit and straw trilby, he believes nature is safest 'when left to be like it is'.\"\n\nAttending Ohio State University, he studied with Gestalt psychologist Hoyt Sherman. His research there concerned the language of visual culture and its relationship with human psychology. He later attended Hunter College, where he received a Masters in Art. Later, he went on to pursue a Research Fellowship in visual studies at MIT, Cambridge, MA.\n\nBeginning with his first major commissioned work, \"Time Landscapes\" in Greenwich Village, NYC, Sonfist received critical acclaim for his innovative use of urban spaces to design havens of nature and green art. His early work in the 1960s and 1970s helped pioneer the burgeoning movement of site-specific sculpture. \nAfter his breakthrough Time Landscape of New York, Sonfist gradually built a reputation as a father of the environmental art movement, presenting a new and unique harmony between ecology and artistry. In 1971, Joshua Taylor, Director of the American Museum of Art, wrote of \"Autobiography of Alan Sonfist\", a one-person exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution, \"...some--like Alan Sonfist ... have reacted to a cosmic consciousness by returning to specific nature in its smallest detail. For art in America, the landscape has meant freedom and expansion, or, when useful, discipline and concentration. But once the artist took possession of his environment, the natural bounty of America was never far from the surface of his art.\"\n\nHis 1971 work, \"Leaves Met the Paper in Time\" complemented Time Landscape in its themes. The piece consists of sheets of dyed paper paired with real leaves of the same shade. While the paper retained its color, the leaves lost theirs over time, which Eleanor Heartney explains as \"suggesting the apparent triumph of technology over nature while memorializing the original state of the now shriveled leaves.\" ′\n\nHis first major publication was on his lecture series at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1969. Sonfist edited \"Art in the Land: A Critical Anthology of Environmental Art,\" which was republished in Europe and Asia due to its reception by critics and artists alike. He has been included in multiple major international exhibition catalogs such as the Dokumenta, the Venice Biennale, and the Paris Biennale. Recently, Dr. Robert Rosenblum wrote an introduction to Sonfist's \"Nature: The End of Art\" which was distributed by Thames and Hudson, and published by Gil Ori.\n\nThroughout his career, Sonfist has given several keynote speeches for public and private events and organizations such as Pennsylvania State University, the Southern Sculpture Conference, and the American Landscape Association in Miami. He has been a featured speaker in numerous symposiums at major institutions and conferences including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Midwest College Association, the U.N. Ecological Conference in São Paulo, Brazil, and the Berlin Ecology Conference. Sonfist has been a featured lecturer at numerous major institutions including the Whitney Museum of Art, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, and the Museum of Contemporary Art of Chicago.\n\nIn 1987, Sonfist's public art installation, \"Time Landscape of St. Louis\", was ordered unilaterally to be destroyed by Evelyn O. Rice, then director of the St. Louis Department of Parks, Recreation and Forestry, only 17 months after installation. Rice declared the artwork a \"public eyesore\". While the then infant Regional Arts Commission was contacted about the destruction, Ms Rice did not use the then new public city policy to convene a panel to review the work prior to removal. Rather, she ordered the city's bulldozers to remove the work as soon as possible. This action created news reports into the larger discussion about public art works, city policy and legality.\nIn the same year he stayed in Italy to carry out his land art project at the Gori Collection, Circles of time\nSonfist has received major awards and grants from private and governmental organizations including the National Endowment for the Arts, the Graham Foundation for Art and Architecture, the Chase Manhattan Bank Foundation, and the U.S. Information Agency. Sonfist's works are included in many international public collections such as Skulpturen Park Köln (Cologne Sculpture Park) in Germany and Villa Celle, in Tuscany, Italy. His work is also featured in collections of major institutions including Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Princeton University Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art – New York City, The Whitney Museum, and the Ludwig Museum in Aachen, Germany.\n\nSome of his most notable solo exhibitions include \"The Autobiography of Alan Sonfist,\" at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, \"Alan Sonfist Landscapes\" at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, \"Trees\" at the High Museum in Atlanta, GA, and \"Trinity River Project\" at the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nA few of his commissions include, but are not limited to: \"Lost Falcon of Westphalia,\" commissioned by Prince Richard of Germany, \"Time Landscape of Indianapolis,\" commissioned by the Eiteljorg Museum Of American Indians and Western Art, and \"Circles of Time,\" on the Gori Estate in Florence, Italy, and \"Birth by Spear,\" in Florence. \nToday, he continues to promote sustainable energy and strives to raise awareness for global climate change with his international projects. Recently, Sonfist collaborated with Green City Planners in Pori, Finland and Tampa, Florida to create green public spaces.\n\nSonfist's breakthrough work, Time Landscape, was New York City's first urban forest. The juxtaposition of the pre-Colonial forest inside a modern day city epitomizes the environmental conscience that Sonfist is known for.\n\nIn his essay \"The New Economics of Environmental Art,\" Jeffrey Deitch wrote of the piece:\n\nAlan Sonfist's New York York City-wide \"Time Landscape\" (1965-1978), most visible to the art world in its segment at the corner of La Guardia Place and Houston Street (1978), is an example of the artwork as a major urban-design plan. This ambitious and carefully researched undertaking consists of a network of sites throughout New York City's five boroughs, where sections of land have been restored to the way they might have appeared in the seventeenth century, before the advent of urbanization. Sonfist spent over ten years developing the project and finally pushing it to fruition. To complete the La Guardia Place site, he had to weave his way through community groups, local politicians, real estate interests, several arms of city government, art patrons, and their lawyers. It was only after shaping alliances with influential neighborhood politicians and agreeing to important compromises with community groups that Sonfist finally brought \"Time Landscape\" to completion ... Sonfist managed all of this without a patron or a sponsoring organization.\n\nAlan Sonfist's more recent works include the Circles of Life, in Kansas City, the Disappearing Forest of Germany, in Cologne, and the Endangered Species of New England in Lincoln, Massachusetts, part of the deCordova Museum and Sculpture Park.\n\nIn 2017, Sonfist completed his Island of Paradise—in collaboration with architect Marco Brizzi and ecologist Carlo Scoccianti—in Tuscany, Italy:\n\nToday, Sonfist continues to promote his message of ecological sustainability and timeless respect for the fragility of nature in each of his green art projects.\n\n\"The concept of a year round natural microcosmic forest, which would contain plants and trees indigenous to pre-colonial New York is fresh and intriguing and is desperately needed for our city.\" – Ed Koch, Former New York City Mayor\n\n\"After making art of quiet distinction for over 30 years, Alan Sonfist suddenly finds himself close to the spotlight. His concern for the fragility of nature, rather than for its sublimeness or monumentality, makes him a forerunner of the new ecological sensibility.\" – Michael Brenson, New York Times\n\n\"Alan is a pioneer of narrative environmental art on a grand scale.\" -Joshua Taylor, former director of the National Collection of Fine Art\n\n"}

In the worst cases, this takes the form of an unconfined explosion, resulting in damage, or destruction of the engine.\n\nRocket fuels, hypergolic or otherwise, must be introduced into the combustion chamber at the correct rate in order to have a controlled rate of production of hot gas. A \"hard start\" indicates that the quantity of combustible propellant that entered the combustion chamber prior to ignition was too large. The result is an excessive spike of pressure, possibly leading to structural failure or even an explosion (sometimes humorously referred to as \"Spontaneous Self Disassembly\").\n\nAvoiding hard starts involves careful timing of the ignition relative to valve timing or varying the mixture ratio so as to limit the maximum pressure that can occur or simply ensuring an adequate ignition source is present well prior to propellant entering the chamber.\n\nExplosions from hard starts usually cannot happen with purely gaseous propellants, since the amount of the gas present in the chamber is limited by the injector area relative to the throat area, and for practical designs, propellant mass escapes too quickly to be an issue.\n\nA famous example of a hard start was the explosion of Wernher von Braun's \"1W\" engine during a demonstration to General Dornberger on December 21, 1932. Delayed ignition allowed the chamber to fill with alcohol and liquid oxygen, which exploded violently. Shrapnel was embedded in the walls, but nobody was hit.\n"}

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 9, 1999. In the episode, after writing a thoughtful letter to the \"Springfield Shopper\", Lisa is invited to join the Springfield chapter of Mensa. When Mayor Quimby later flees Springfield, the group takes control of the town, hoping to improve the lives of Springfieldians through the rule of the smartest. Meanwhile, Homer poses for a series of erotic photos.\n\n\"They Saved Lisa's Brain\" was directed by Pete Michels and written by Matt Selman, although the idea for the episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer. It featured the first official appearance of Lindsey Naegle and was the first episode in which theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking guest-starred as himself. The \"Simpsons\" staff wanted Hawking to guest-star because they needed someone who would be smarter than all of Springfield's Mensa members, and because they had heard that he was a fan of the show. The episode features references to \"Star Trek\", painter Vincent van Gogh and architect Frank Lloyd Wright, and mentions the theory of the universe being toroidal, the same shape as a doughnut.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"They Saved Lisa's Brain\" was seen by approximately 6.8 million viewers, a very low amount for the series. Following the episode's broadcast, Selman made a controversial statement about East St. Louis, which was pronounced the least livable city in the United States in the episode. While the episode received mixed reviews from critics, Hawking's appearance garnered critical acclaim, and has since appeared in several lists of best guest appearances on \"The Simpsons\". Hawking appeared in three further episodes, and an action figure based on his cameos in the series has been produced.

Many Springfield residents enter the contest, but things do not go well when one of the judges, Rainier Wolfcastle, declares himself the winner for \"being seen with you freaks\". The contest ends in a riot and Lisa ends up hit in the face twice with pudding. She denounces Springfield for its anti-intellectualism in an open letter that ends up in the newspaper, which no one reads. This impresses the Springfield Mensa chapter, which accepts her for membership after Principal Skinner shared her placement tests and she brought them a pie for their latest meeting.\n\nLisa joins Mensa alongside Comic Book Guy, Dr. Hibbert, Principal Skinner, Professor Frink, and Lindsay Naegle. After the pleasantries, Lisa finds herself at home alongside the Mensa members, whose sense of humor is so esoteric that it is said to be enjoyed by the \"Dennis Miller ratio\" of Americans. After being bullied out of their reserved gazebo at a park by drunks and Chief Wiggum, they fear that Springfield's quality is poor because of the city's stupidest residents having power over their civic institutions. The Mensa group goes to confront Mayor Quimby about the gazebo incident, until he escapes from the city when he mistakenly thinks the group has evidence about his corruption. The town's constitution states that in the absence of the mayor, the town is to be governed by the smartest by geniocracy. Now in control of Springfield, the group hopes that things will become much better.\n\nHowever, once they are in control, the group allows power to go to their heads. At first, they efficiently implement their ideas for Springfield, which include banning green traffic lights and playing only classical music at the dog races, which elevates Springfield past East St. Louis on the list of America's 300 Most Livable Cities. However, they begin to internally fight over other ideas such as having theaters for shadow puppets and a broccoli juice program, and their wildly unpopular plans at a public meeting (including the banning of all contact sports and Comic Book Guy's plan to limit breeding to every seven years) further expose the rifts inside the group.\n\nThe Springfield townspeople, angered by the new laws, surround the intellectuals in an angry mob and bring an end to Mensa's rule. Stephen Hawking has shown up to see what the Mensa group is up to and makes it clear he is unimpressed; however, he saves Lisa from being seriously injured by the angry townspeople. In the end, Hawking and Homer converse at Moe's Tavern for a drink – Hawking becomes intrigued in Homer's theory of a \"donut-shaped universe\" and thinks about stealing it. Homer imitates Hawking in an attempt to make him pay the tab and gets punched by a boxing glove on a spring, which is concealed in Hawking's wheelchair.\n\nIn the episode's other storyline, Homer steals a gift certificate during the post-contest and has erotic photos taken of himself as a gift to Marge, who is at first impressed, but gets distracted by the interior design Homer did in their basement.\n\n\"They Saved Lisa's Brain\" was written by Matt Selman and directed by Pete Michels. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 9, 1999. Although the episode's first draft was written by Selman, the idea for the episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer. In the episode's setpiece, Homer and Bart participate in a gross out contest, while Marge and Lisa are in the audience. According to Selman, the writers took inspiration from real gross out contests, which were \"sweeping the nation\" at the time. Before the contest in the episode, the spectators are given free samples of a pudding called Grandma Plopwell's. The name of the pudding was inspired by a brand of pies called Aunt Freshly, which the \"Simpsons\" writers usually ate at the time.\n\nThe episode features the first official appearance of Lindsey Naegle, a sleazy businesswoman who has since become a recurring character in the series. While different versions of the character had appeared in the series before, namely in the season 8 episode \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\", the season 9 episode \"Girly Edition\", and the season 10 episode \"Make Room for Lisa\", the character's final design was first seen in \"They Saved Lisa's Brain\". The episode also mentions the character's name for the first time. Naegle's name was partly based on Selman's agent Sue Neagle, and Lindsey was chosen as the first name because Selman thought it sounded \"annoying\" and \"pretentious\". Naegle is voiced by Tress MacNeille, who Selman described as a \"huge asset\" to the series, and stated that she \"breathes life\" into the character.\n\n\"They Saved Lisa's Brain\" features English theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking as himself. According to executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean, Hawking was asked to guest-star because \"we [they] were looking for someone much smarter than all the Mensa members [in Springfield]\", and so they \"naturally thought of him\". Selman added that the \"Simpsons\" staff had heard that Hawking was a fan of the show, and that Hawking's family members wanted him to guest-star. Bill Mann of \"The Press Democrat\" argued that Hawking was chosen to guest star in order to boost the series' ratings during the May \"sweeps\". Mann wrote that \"sweeps\" are \"used to set local TV ad rates for the months ahead\".\n\nIn her book \"Stephen Hawking: a biography\", Kristen Larsen wrote that Hawking almost missed his recording session, as his wheelchair broke down two days before his flight to Los Angeles, where the recording took place. In order to make the necessary repairs, Hawking's graduate assistant Chris Burgoyne, aided by a technician, worked a 36‑hour shift. Hawking was 40 minutes late when he arrived in Los Angeles. When he met the \"Simpsons\" staff, he apologized, saying \"Sorry for being late.\" According to Selman, Hawking was very humble regarding the episode's jokes about him, and stated that he \"took a lot of shots\" at himself. The only note that Hawking gave regarding the script was that he did not want to be portrayed as drunk in the episode's last scene, in which he is discussing astronomy with Homer in Moe's tavern.\n\nBecause of his motor neurone disease, Hawking was unable to speak, and he communicated using a custom-made computer. With small movements of his body, Hawking wrote a text onto the computer, which was then spoken by a voice synthesizer. Because of this, Hawking had to write all his lines on his computer, while the staff recorded them by placing a microphone in front of the computer's speaker. \"It's easy to do a fake Stephen Hawking in your comedy TV show\", Selman said in the DVD commentary for the episode. \"Any computer can sound just like his computer, but every line that we wrote for him, he typed in himself and we recorded with our microphones as if it had come out of a regular mouth.\" Some of Hawking's lines were difficult to record. In particular, the word \"Fruitopia\" was difficult for Hawking's computer to \"put together\" correctly, and it \"took forever\" to make the word sound right from the voice synthesizer.\n\nIn their book \"The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer\", William Irwin, Mark T. Conard and Aeon J. Skoble wrote that \"They Saved Lisa's Brain\" in detail explores \"the possibility of a utopian alternative to politics as usual in Springfield\". They described \"They Saved Lisa's Brain\" as an \"epitome\" of \"The Simpsons\" diverse comedic humor, and wrote that it can be \"enjoyed in two levels\", as both \"broad farce\" and \"intellectual satire\". As an example of the episode's farcical humor, they referred to the episode's subplot, which, they wrote, \"contains some of the grossest humor in the long history of \"The Simpsons\".\" At the same time, the episode is \"filled\" with what they described as \"subtle cultural allusions\", such as the design of Mensa group's locale, which is based on the house of American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Likewise, Lisa's challenge to Springfield calls attention to the \"cultural limitations of small-town America\", while the episode also argues that intellectual disdain for the common man can be carried too far, and theory can \"all too easily lose touch with common sense\". They also argued that the episode, as well as the series as a whole, offers a kind of intellectual defense of the common man against intellectuals, which they opined \"helps explain its popularity and broad appeal [...] [\"They Saved Lisa's Brain\"] defends the common man against the intellectual, in a way that both the common man and the intellectual can understand and enjoy\".\n\nIn the last scene in the episode, Hawking and Homer are seen discussing the universe in Moe's tavern. Scully stated that the scene was included because it \"was a chance to get the world's smartest man and the world's stupidest man in the same place\". In the scene, Hawking tells Homer \"Your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing... I may have to steal it.\" In his book \"What's Science Ever Done For Us?: What The Simpsons Can Teach Us About Physics, Robots, Life and the Universe\", Paul Halpern wrote that in mathematics, a \"donut-shape\", the three-dimensional generalization of a ring, is referred to as a torus. The generalization of a torus, any closed curve spun in a circle around an axis, is called a toroid. According to Halpern, Hawking's line references the fact that there are \"genuine\" scientific theories that the universe is toroidal.\n\nOne of the judges for the gross out contest in the episode's is Madeleine Albright, who was the US Secretary of State at the time the episode was made. During the riot that follows the contest, a travelling exhibition of paintings by Van Gogh is burned to flames. In the episode's subplot, Homer hires a photographer to take erotic pictures of him. The design of the photographer was based on American portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz. The song that plays during the photographing scenes is \"I'm Too Sexy\" by English pop trio Right Said Fred. During the rules and regulations announcement, Comic Book Guy declares that sexual intercourse will only be permitted once every seven years in Springfield; this is a reference to pon farr, a term used in the \"Star Trek\" franchise to describe the psychophysical effect of the estrous cycle that affects the fictional Vulcan race every seven years. His taunting of \"I am smart, much smarter than you, Hib-bert!\" is also to the tune of the \"Star Trek\" fanfare. The episode also mentions actress Geena Davis and cartoonist Mell Lazarus, both of whom are members of Mensa.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on May 9, 1999, \"They Saved Lisa's Brain\" received a 6.8 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 6.8 million viewers. It finished in 54th place in the ratings for the week of May 3–9, 1999. The episode's viewership was considered very low by the \"Boston Herald\", who noted that it reached \"historic lows\" in the ratings.\n\nIn a scene in the episode, Comic Book Guy announces that Springfield is in 299th place on a list of the United States' 300 most livable cities, with East St. Louis being in last place. A journalist for a \"local East St. Louis paper\" noticed this, and called Selman to ask him why they were \"taking a shot at East St. Louis\". Selman jokingly replied: \"because it's a crack-ridden slum\". After the interview, he went on vacation in Greece for two weeks. While Selman was on vacation, executive producer and the episode's showrunner Mike Scully received a phone call from \"The Simpsons\" publicist Antonia Coffman, who reported that Selman's comment on East St. Louis had been taken \"very seriously\" by the newspaper. \"The Simpsons\" staff received several angry letters from East St. Louis' residents, demanding an apology. Because Selman was out of reach, the other staff members had to take care of the controversy.\n\nWhen Selman returned, Scully scolded him and told him that he had to apologize to the mayor of East St. Louis, who, unbeknownst to Selman, was portrayed by Marc Wilmore. Wilmore, a former writer on the television comedy \"The PJ's\", had been asked by Scully to participate in a practical joke, in which he would play the mayor of East St. Louis and confront Selman about his controversial statement. According to Selman, Wilmore gave an \"Oscar-worthy performance\". \"I was terrified\", he stated in the DVD commentary for the episode, \"[we had] a twenty-minute discussion in which [Wilmore] said that [his] children were teased at school [because of Selman's comments], and that the Fox affiliate were gonna be thrown off the air...\" According to Wilmore, Selman immediately blamed the other writers. Said Selman, \"Well, everyone participates, you know [...] Have you never heard of the word 'collaboration'?\" Selman realized the joke when he turned around and saw \"all the other writers laughing\". \"I was so relieved\", he said, \"I was soaked with sweat [...] I had betrayed my fellow writers, tried to get them in trouble, and they all knew me for the turn-coat that I was.\"\n\nAs compensation for his involvement with the joke, Wilmore was given a role in the season 11 episode \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge\", in which he played a psychologist. In 2002, Wilmore became a writer on \"The Simpsons\".\n\nOn August 7, 2007, \"They Saved Lisa's Brain\" was released as part of \"The Simpsons – The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD box set. Mike Scully, Matt Selman, Ron Hauge, Rich Appel, Marc Wilmore and Pete Michels participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode. Following its home video release, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. Giving the episode a positive review, DVD Town's James Plath described it as one of the season's better episodes. Ian Jane of DVD Talk wrote that, while episodes that revolve around Lisa tend to be \"less popular\" than others, he considered \"They Saved Lisa's Brain\" to be \"well done\". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a mixed review, writing \"I like the fact that 'Brain' pokes some fun at Mensa, one of the more smug, self-congratulatory groups to be found. The show manages a few good laughs as it goes after various pretensions.\" However, he added that \"the show peters out after a while\", and that it \"never becomes particularly memorable\". A reviewer for Currentfilm.com wrote that, while the episode \"isn't without its charms\", it \"just don't hold up very well\". Jake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News wrote that the episode is \"great if you think palindromes are funny\", and added that it was one of the season's worst episodes. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\" described it as a \"retread\" of the season 9 episode \"Lisa the Simpson\". They wrote \"Once we're past the How Low Will You Go show, the episode takes a nose-dive until the last few minutes.\" They concluded their review by calling the episode \"Very, very tedious.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Stephen Hawking's appearance in the episode was acclaimed by critics. Although they generally disliked the episode, Martyn and Wood wrote that Hawking's cameo \"saves [the episode] from being very boring\". Plath called the performance \"very funny\", while Jane described it as \"great\". Hawking reached seventh place in UGO's list of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Top 11 Guest Stars\", and finished in fourteenth place in \"The Simpsons 20 best guest voices of all time\" by Ryan Stewart of \"The Boston Phoenix\". Stewart wrote that Hawking's line \"\"Your theory of a doughnut-shaped universe intrigues me, Homer. I may have to steal it\" was a \"memorable\" quote from the episode. Ethan Alter of \"The Morning Call\" described Hawking's cameo as one of the series' ten best, and wrote that Hawking's best line in the episode was \"I wanted to see your Utopia, but now I see it is more of a Fruitopia.\" Writing for IGN, Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson and Brian Zoromski placed Hawking at number sixteen on their list \"Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances\". They wrote that he had a \"fairly major\" role in the episode, and that he had \"several great lines\".\n\nAfter the episode aired, Hawking told the \"Simpsons\" staff that he \"loved\" all the jokes and in an interview with \"The Guardian\" in 2005, he stated that his guest appearances on \"The Simpsons\" were \"great fun\". An action figure based on Hawking's appearance in \"The Simpsons\" has been produced, with the figurine's computer screen reading \"If you're looking for trouble, you've found it\", a line from \"They Saved Lisa's Brain\". Since \"They Saved Lisa's Brain\", Hawking has guest-starred three times on \"The Simpsons\". In 2005, he appeared in the season 16 episode \"Don't Fear the Roofer\"; in 2007, he starred in the season 18 episode \"Stop or My Dog Will Shoot\"; and in 2010, he appeared in the Season 22 premiere \"Elementary School Musical\".\n\nHowever, Hawking has also expressed dissatisfaction regarding the impact on his notoriety caused by his appearance in the episode. In a debate with physicist Brian Cox in \"The Guardian\", Hawking was asked what the most common misconception about his work was. He replied, \"People think I'm a \"Simpsons\" character.\" Writing for \"The Daily Telegraph\", Peter Hutchison argued that Hawking \"feels he is sometimes not properly recognised for his contribution to our understanding of the universe.\" In his book \"The book is dead: long live the book\", Sherman Young wrote that most people know Hawking from his appearance on \"The Simpsons\", rather than from anything he has written.\n\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "1822769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822769", "title": "Steven Milloy", "text": "Steven Milloy\n\nSteven J. Milloy is a lawyer, lobbyist, author and Fox News commentator. He describes himself as a libertarian and his close financial and organizational ties to tobacco and oil companies have been the subject of criticism, as Milloy has consistently disputed the scientific consensus on climate change and the health risks of second-hand smoke.\n\nAmong the topics Milloy has addressed are what he believes are false claims regarding DDT, global warming, Alar, breast implants, second-hand smoke, ozone depletion, and mad cow disease. Milloy runs CSRWatch.com, which monitors and criticizes the corporate social responsibility movement. From the 1990s until the end of 2005, he was an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, which hosted the JunkScience.com site. He is an adjunct scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Milloy is head of the Congressional Effect Fund (formerly the Free Enterprise Action Fund), a mutual fund he runs with former tobacco executive Tom Borelli.\n\nHe also operates The Advancement of Sound Science Center (TASSC), a non-profit organization established by Philip Morris Companies Inc. to counter legislation against second-hand smoke. (Now from his home in Potomac, Maryland). TASSC was originally known as The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition, which was established by the Philip Morris controlled public relations company APCO specifically to attack the scientific credentials of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) when they threatened to categorise second-hand smoke as a \"known carcinogen\". Bonner Cohen who published the EPA Watch newsletter for Philip Morris was a partner with Milloy in both the original TASSC and the revamped operation through the Cato Institute; TASSC was a major lobbyist in attacking EPA science on global warming.\n\nMilloy holds a B.A. in Natural Sciences from Johns Hopkins University, a Master of Health Sciences in Biostatistics from the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health, a Juris Doctor from the University of Baltimore, and a Master of Laws from the Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nThe National Environmental Policy Institute (NEPI) was formed in early 1993 by Congressman Don Ritter (R-PA) and Dennis Hertel. (D-MI). Most of the initial funding for this 'greenwash' lobby group came from Occidental Petroleum and other oil companies. Milloy styled himself as NEPI's \"Director of Science Policy Studies\". National Environmental Policy Institute These companies wanted to oppose aspects of the SuperFund clean-up program. NEPI's publication, \"Science-Based Risk Assessment: A Key to the Superfund Puzzle\", says: \"Sound science and more accurate risk assessments can significantly reduce the costs of remediation, while reducing real health risks when they are found. Steven J. Milloy of the NEPI suggests that the costs of cleanups would fall by 60 percent if the program focused more directly on risk when identifying the appropriate remedies.\"\n\nAt the same time, Milloy was working through Philip Morris's specialist-science/PR company APCO & Associates, but he was relegated to working behind the scenes as a contact for the newly formed TASSC, and on developing a new electronic-mail/computer business venture known as \"Issues Watch\" for APCO. APCO formally established TASSC in October 1, 1993 The budget for the first full year of operation was $365,411. \n\nBy 1994, according to his website, Milloy was project leader of the Regulatory Impact Analysis Project, Inc. for the U.S. Department of Energy. The Cato Institute, where he was listed as an adjunct scholar, published his work from 1995 to 2005. Milloy began his criticism of \"Junk science\" as president of the Environmental Policy Analysis Network in 1996.\n\nMilloy's employment by the EOP Group Inc. (major lobbyists) dates back to before 1995, and it includes a record of lobbying on behalf of the Fort Howard Corporation, the International Food Additives Council, Monsanto Co. and Edison Electrics. The Competitive Enterprise Institute also proposed to Philip Morris that Milloy and his partners Michael Gough and Michael Fumento should be used to attack the FDA through reports to the House and Senate on risk Management reform. \n\nIn March 1997, Milloy moved from the backroom to become president of The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC) [Established under Gov. Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico by Philip Morris], which later became The Advancement of Sound Science Center. He has links through Philip Morris and Fox News to Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation. He was a correspondent for Fox News between 2002 and 2009, and he became a policy director at Murray Energy and a member of Donald Trump's presidential transition team.\n\nMilloy has used the term \"junk science\" in public debate, which he defines as \"faulty scientific data and analysis used to advance special and, often, hidden agendas.\" According to Milloy, \"the junk science 'mob' includes: The MEDIA, [who] may use junk science for sensational headlines and programming…PERSONAL INJURY LAWYERS, [who] may use junk science to bamboozle juries into awarding huge verdicts,\" and others. Milloy frequently applies the term to climate change science and certain health controversies.\n\nScientists and science writers have argued the term is used, by Milloy and others, almost exclusively to \"denigrate scientists and studies whose findings do not serve the corporate cause,\" in the words of David Michaels. In an editorial in \"Chemical & Engineering News\", Editor-in-Chief Rudy Baum called Milloy's junkscience.com website \"the best known\" example of \"a right wing effort in the U.S. to discredit widely accepted science, technology and medical information.\" He went on to label Milloy \"a tireless antiscience polemicist\" who applies the term \"junk science\" to \"anything that doesn't match his right-wing concept of reality.\" Along similar lines, an editorial in the \"American Journal of Public Health\" noted that \"... attacking the science underlying difficult public policy decisions with the label of 'junk' has become a common ploy for those opposed to regulation ... One need only peruse JunkScience.com to get a sense of the long list of public health issues for which research has been so labeled.\"\n\nMilloy has criticized research linking second-hand tobacco smoke to cancer, claiming that \"the vast majority of studies reported no statistical association.\" In 1993, Milloy dismissed an Environmental Protection Agency report linking second-hand tobacco smoke to cancer as \"a joke.\" Five years later Milloy claimed vindication after a federal court criticized the E.P.A.'s conclusions. However, the court's finding against the EPA was overturned on appeal. When the \"British Medical Journal\" published a meta-analysis confirming a link in 1997, Milloy wrote, \"Of the 37 studies, only 7—less than 19 percent—reported statistically significant increases in lung cancer incidence... Meta-analysis of the secondhand smoke studies was a joke when EPA did it in 1993. And it remains a joke today.\" When another researcher published a study linking second-hand smoke to cancer, Milloy wrote that she \"... must have pictures of journal editors in compromising positions with farm animals. How else can you explain her studies seeing the light of day?\"\n\nWhile at FoxNews.com, Milloy has continued to criticize claims that second-hand tobacco smoke causes cancer. However, with the release of confidential tobacco industry documents as part of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, the objectivity of Milloy's stance on second-hand smoke has been questioned. Based on this documentation, journalists Paul D. Thacker and George Monbiot, as well as the Union of Concerned Scientists and others, have contended that Milloy is a paid advocate for the tobacco industry.\n\nMilloy's junkscience.com website was reviewed and revised by a public relations firm hired by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. Milloy also worked as executive director of The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC), which was established in 1993 by Philip Morris and its public relations firm \"to expand and assist Philip Morris in its efforts with issues in targeted states.\" A 1994 Philip Morris memo listed TASSC among its \"Tools to Affect Legislative Decisions\". According to its 1997 annual report, TASSC \"sponsored\" junkscience.com.\n\n\"The New Republic\" reported that Milloy, who is presented by Fox News as an independent journalist, was under contract to provide consulting services to Philip Morris through the end of 2005. In 2000 and 2001, for example, Milloy received a total of $180,000 in payments from Philip Morris for consulting services. A spokesperson for Fox News stated, \"Fox News was unaware of Milloy's connection with Philip Morris. Any affiliation he had should have been disclosed.\" Milloy's association with the Cato Institute ended shortly afterwards; however, , he continues to write for FoxNews.com, where he is described as a \"junk science expert.\" Monbiot wrote: \"Even after Fox News was told about the money [Milloy] had been receiving from Philip Morris and Exxon, it continued to employ him, without informing its readers about his interests.\" Thacker wrote:\nMilloy argues that human activity has little impact on climate change and that regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions are unwarranted and harmful to business interests. He has recently offered a prize of $500,000 to anyone who can \"prove, in a scientific manner, that humans are causing harmful global warming,\" stating that \"JunkScience.com, in its sole discretion, will determine the winner, if any.\"\n\nIn 2004, when the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment was released by the Arctic Council and the International Arctic Science Committee, Milloy wrote that the report \"pretty much debunks itself.\" Milloy based his assertions that the variation was natural on his interpretation of just one graph from the overview of the large study. One of the lead authors of the study, oceanographer James J. McCarthy, commented that those taking Milloy's position would \"have to refute what are hundreds of scientific papers that reconstruct various pieces of this climate puzzle.\" Milloy's assertion was repeated by lobbyists including the Competitive Enterprise Institute\n\nIn 2005, it was reported that non-profit organizations operating out of Milloy's home, and in some cases employing no staff, have received large payments from ExxonMobil during his tenure with Fox News. A Fox News spokesperson stated that Milloy is \"... affiliated with several not-for-profit groups that possibly may receive funding from Exxon, but he certainly does not receive funding directly from Exxon.\"\n\nMilloy is the Executive Director of DemandDebate.com, an organization that seeks to eliminate what it calls \"bias\" in environmental education. A Competitive Enterprise Institute press release says he \"coordinated\" the group's activities at the recent Live Earth concert in New York, at which a plane circled the event pulling a banner reading, \"DON’T BELIEVE AL GORE — DEMAND DEBATE.COM.\"\n\nIn 1998, Milloy, writing on behalf of TASSC, co-wrote an article which called for the abolition of the position of United States Surgeon General. \"We have not had a surgeon general for three years. Has anyone noticed? Is anyone's health at risk,\" asked the authors.\n\nMilloy has campaigned against the 1972 ban on non-public-health uses of DDT in the United States and in favour of wider use of DDT against malaria, which he claims could be largely eliminated if DDT were used more aggressively. He has been particularly critical of Rachel Carson who, he wrote, \"misrepresented the existing science on bird reproduction and was wrong about DDT causing cancer.\"\n\nMilloy's junkscience.com web site features \"The Malaria Clock: A Green Eco-Imperialist Legacy of Death\", which he claims counts up the approximate number of new malaria cases and deaths in the world, most of which he says could have been prevented by the use of DDT. , Milloy's clock stood at more than 94 million dead, 90% of whom were said to have been expectant mothers and children under five years of age. \"Infanticide on this scale appears without parallel in human history,\" writes Milloy. \"This is not ecology. This is not conservation. This is genocide.\"\n\nCritics have argued that the clock holds Carson \"responsible for more deaths than malaria has caused in total,\" a charge that a footnote at the bottom of the malaria clock webpage seems to acknowledge, stating: \"Note that some of these cases would have occurred irrespective of DDT use. Note also that, while enormously influential, the US ban did not immediately terminate global DDT use and that developing world malaria mortality increased over time rather than instantly leaping to the estimated value of 2,700,000 deaths per year. However, certain in the knowledge that even one human sacrificed on the altar of green misanthropy is infinitely too many, I let stand the linear extrapolation of numbers from an instant start on the 1st of the month following this murderous ban.\"\n\nMilloy's claims about malaria in general are generally held to have been debunked, with many commentators pointing to the close links between Milloy, DDT-advocacy and the tobacco industry as casting suspicion on the motives for his difficult to support claims.\n\nIn 2006, following a press release by the World Health Organization recommending more extensive use of indoor residual spraying with DDT and other pesticides, Milloy wrote, \"It’s a relief that the WHO has finally come to its senses.\" In 2007, the WHO clarified its position, saying it is \"very much concerned with health consequences from use of DDT\" and reaffirmed its commitment to phasing out the use of DDT.\n\nOn September 14, 2001, three days after terrorist attacks destroyed the World Trade Center, Milloy wrote that the World Trade Center towers might have stood longer, preventing many casualties, had the use of asbestos fire-resistant lagging not been discontinued during the Towers' construction. Milloy's article reported that, \"\"In 1971, New York City banned the use of asbestos in spray fireproofing. At that time, asbestos insulating material had only been sprayed up to the 64th floor of the World Trade Center towers,\"\" and cited an expert who questioned the efficacy of the asbestos-free lagging that was used on the steel in the upper floors.\n\nAdvocates for banning asbestos were highly critical of the article, questioning his motives and disputing his conclusions. The International Ban Asbestos Secretariat charged him with \"insensitivity that is hard to fathom.\"\n\nResponding to criticism of the safety of the food product Quorn by the \nCenter for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), Milloy accused CSPI of having an undisclosed relationship with Quorn's main competitor, Gardenburger. Writing for FoxNews.com, Milloy said that \"CSPI appears to have an unsavory relationship with Quorn competitor, Gardenburger\" and called the CSPI's complaints \"unscrupulous shrieking\", noting comments in CSPI newsletters like \"Remember the saturated fat and the E.coli bacteria that could be hiding inside [a hamburger]? You can keep the taste but forget the worries with Gardenburger.\"\n\nIn 1999, David Platt Rall, a prominent environmental scientist, died in a car accident. Steven Milloy, at the time a Cato adjunct scholar, commented: \"Scratch one junk scientist...\". Cato Institute President Edward Crane called Milloy's comments an \"inexcusable lapse in judgment and civility,\" but Milloy refused to apologize, stating \"I'm sorry for [Rall's] family that he's dead. It's not intended as a slight to them. But he had a huge role to play in junk science and that's undeniable\".\n\nThe United States Senate Lobby Filing Disclosure Program lists Milloy as a registered lobbyist for the EOP Group for the years 1998–2000. The guidebook \"Washington Representatives\" also listed him as a lobbyist for the EOP Group in 1996. The EOP Group's clients include the American Crop Protection Association (pesticides), the Chlorine Chemistry Council, Edison Electric Institute (fossil and nuclear energy), Fort Howard Corp. (a paper manufacturer) and the National Mining Association. Milloy himself was personally registered as a lobbyist for Monsanto Company and the International Food Additives Council.\nMilloy denies ever lobbying, and in a 1998 email response to his registration as a lobbyist under EOP he wrote:\nMilloy and former tobacco executive Tom Borelli run a mutual fund called the Free Enterprise Action Fund (FEAF). The fund has criticised companies that voluntarily adopt high environmental standards. Through the platform of the FEAF, Milloy has criticized a number of other corporations for adopting environmental initiatives:\n\nFEAF has been criticised by investment analyst Chuck Jaffe as being \"an advocacy group in search of assets.\" Jaffe concludes \"Strip away the rhetoric, and you’re getting a very expensive, underperforming index fund, while Milloy and his partner Thomas Borelli get a platform for raising their pet issues.\"\n\nSimilarly, Daniel Gross, in a \"Slate\" magazine article, wrote that FEAF \"seems to be a lobbying enterprise masquerading as a mutual fund.\" Gross noted that Milloy and Tom Borelli, the former head of corporate scientific affairs for Philip Morris, lack any money management experience; he also noted that FEAF had badly underperformed the S&P 500 during its first 10 months of existence. Gross concluded that \"...in the short term, it looks like Borelli and Milloy are essentially paying the fund for the privilege of using it as a platform to broadcast their views on corporate governance, global warming, and a host of other issues.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Set in the industrial city of Łódź, \"The Promised Land\" tells the story of a Pole, a German, and a Jew struggling to build a factory in the raw world of 19th-century capitalism.\n\nWajda presents a shocking image of the city, with its dirty and dangerous factories and ostentatiously opulent residences devoid of taste and culture. The film follows in the footsteps of Charles Dickens, Émile Zola and Maxim Gorky, as well as German expressionists such as Knopf, Meidner and Grosz, who gave testimony of social protest.\n\nIn the 2015 poll conducted by Polish Museum of Cinematography in Łódź, \"The Promised Land\" was ranked first on the list of the greatest Polish films of all time.\n\nKarol Borowiecki (Daniel Olbrychski), a young Polish nobleman, is the managing engineer at the Bucholz textile factory. He is ruthless in his career pursuits, and unconcerned with the long tradition of his financially-declined family. He plans to set up his own factory with the help of his friends Max Baum (Andrzej Seweryn), a German and heir to an old handloom factory, and Moritz Welt (Wojciech Pszoniak), an independent Jewish businessman. Borowiecki's affair with Lucy Zucker (Kalina Jędrusik), the wife of another textile magnate, gives him advance notice of a change in cotton tariffs and helps Welt to make a killing on the Hamburg futures market. However, more money has to be found so all three characters cast aside their pride to raise the necessary capital.\n\nOn the day of the factory opening, Borowiecki has to deny his affair with Zucker's wife to a jealous husband who, himself a Jew, makes him swear on a sacred Catholic object. Borowiecki then accompanies Lucy on her exile to Berlin. However, Zucker sends an associate to spy on his wife; he confirms the affair and informs Zucker, who takes his revenge on Borowiecki by burning down his brand new, uninsured factory. Borowiecki and his friends lose all that they had worked for.\n\nThe film fast forwards a few years. Borowiecki recovered financially by marrying Mada Müller, a rich heiress, and he owns his own factory. His factory is threatened by a workers' strike. Borowiecki is forced to decide whether or not to open fire on the striking and demonstrating workers, who throw a rock into the room where Borowiecki and others are gathered. He is reminded by an associate that it is never too late to change his ways. Borowiecki, who has never shown human compassion toward his subordinates, authorizes the police to open fire nevertheless.\n\n\nParts of the film were filmed at the Villa of \"Cotton King\" Karl Wilhelm Scheibler.\n\nAt the 9th Moscow International Film Festival in 1975, the film won the Golden Prize. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\n"}

He was the son of Stephen Mackenzie, a general practitioner and surgeon. He was educated at Dr Greig's school in Walthamstow and at King's College London.\n\nAfter going through the medical course at the London Hospital and becoming a member to the Royal College of Surgeons in 1858, he studied abroad in Paris, Vienna and Budapest where he learned the use of the newly invented laryngoscope under Johann Czermak.\n\nReturning to London in 1862, he worked at the London Hospital and earned his degree in medicine. In 1863 he won the Jacksonian prize at the Royal College of Surgeons for an essay on the \"Pathology and Treatment of Diseases of the Larynx: The Diagnostic Indications to include the Appearance as Seen in the Living Person\". He was the first to use the terms abductors and adductors to describe the muscles that govern the opening and closing of the glottis. He then devoted himself to becoming a specialist in diseases of the throat.\n\nIn 1863 the Hospital for Diseases of the Throat in King Street, Golden Square, was founded, largely owing to his initiative, and by his work there and at the London Hospital (where he was one of the physicians from 1866 to 1873) Morell Mackenzie rapidly became recognized throughout Europe as a leading authority, and acquired an extensive practice. A plaque at 32 Golden Square, unveiled in May 1995, commemorates the original hospital.\n\nHis reputation grew even more with the publication of three important books, which became the founding stones of the new specialty of laryngology:\n\n\nIn 1887 Mackenzie was one of the founders of the \"Journal of Laryngology and Rhinology\" and of the \"British Rhino-Laryngological Association\".\n\nSo great was his reputation that in May 1887, when the crown prince of Germany (afterwards the Emperor Frederick III) was attacked by the affection of the throat of which he ultimately died, Morell Mackenzie was specially summoned to attend him. The German physicians who had attended the prince since the beginning of March (Karl Gerhardt, and subsequently Adalbert Tobold, Ernst von Bergmann, and others), had diagnosed his ailment on 18 May as cancer of the throat; but Morell Mackenzie insisted (basing his opinion on a microscopical examination by a great pathologist, Rudolf Virchow, of a portion of the tissue) that the disease was not demonstrably cancerous, that an operation for the extirpation of the larynx (planned for the 21 May) was unjustifiable, and that the growth might well be a benign one and therefore curable by other treatment.\n\nThe question was one not only of personal but of political importance, since it was unsure whether any one suffering from an incapacitating disease like cancer could, according to the family law of the Hohenzollerns, occupy the German throne, and there was talk of a renunciation of the succession by the crown prince. It was freely hinted, moreover, that some of the doctors themselves were influenced by political considerations. At any rate, Morell Mackenzie's opinion was followed: the crown prince went to England, under his treatment, and was present at the celebrations of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in June. Morell Mackenzie was knighted in September 1887 for his services, and appointed a Grand Commander of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern.\n\nIn November, however, the German doctors were again called into consultation, and it was ultimately admitted that the disease really was cancer; but Mackenzie, with very questionable judgment, more than hinted that it had become malignant since his first examination, in consequence of the irritating effect of the treatment by the German doctors. The crown prince became emperor on 9 March 1888 and died on 15 June. During all this period, a violent quarrel raged between Mackenzie and the German medical world. The German doctors published an account of the illness, to which Mackenzie replied by a work entitled \"The Fatal Illness of Frederick the Noble\" (1888), the publication of which caused him to be censured by the Royal College of Surgeons.\n\nAfter this sensational episode in his career, the remainder of Sir Morell Mackenzie's life was uneventful, and he died somewhat suddenly in London, on 3 February 1892 and was buried in the churchyard at Wargrave in Berkshire where he had a house in the country. He published several books on laryngoscopy and diseases of the throat.\n\nBiographies of Mackenzie were published by H.R. Haweis (1893) and R. Scott Stevenson (1946).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1822794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822794", "title": "Gear inches", "text": "Gear inches\n\nGear inches is one of several relative measures of bicycle gearing, giving an indication of the mechanical advantage of different gears. Values for 'gear inches' typically range from 20 (very low gearing) via 70 (medium gearing) to 125 (very high gearing); as in a car, low gearing is for going up hills and high gearing is for going fast.\n\n'Gear inches' is actually the diameter in inches of the drive wheel of a penny-farthing bicycle with equivalent gearing.\n\nWhen the high wheeler or penny-farthing was the \"ordinary\" bicycle form, the comparative diameter in inches of the driven wheel was an indication of relative speed and effort. A 60-inch wheel propelled a bicycle faster than a 50-inch wheel when both were cranked at the same cadence. The technology of the high wheeler imposed a natural limit—a 60-inch wheel was about the maximum size that could be straddled by ordinary sized legs. When \"safeties\" replaced \"ordinaries,\" chains and sprockets allowed small wheels to be turned faster than the pedal cranks. As result, a 28-inch wheel could be made to move a bicycle at the same speed as a 60-inch wheel. Such a bicycle was then said to be geared at 60 gear inches and pedalled similar to an ordinary with a 60-inch wheel. Thus on a bicycle geared at 72 gear inches one revolution of the pedals advances the bicycle the distance that a 72-inch wheel would in one revolution.\n\nGear inches express gear ratios in terms of the diameter of an equivalent directly driven wheel, and is calculated as follows:\n\nThis formula assumes that any hub gear is in direct drive. A further factor is needed for other gears (many online gear calculators have these factors built in for common hub gears).\n\nFor simplicity, 'gear inches' is normally rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nFor example, suppose the drive wheel is actually 26 inches in diameter. If the front chainring and rear sprocket have equal numbers of teeth, one turn of the pedals produces exactly one turn of the drive wheel, just as if the pedals were directly driving the drive wheel. That combination of gears and wheel is said to be \"26 gear inches.\" If the front chainring has 48 teeth and the rear sprocket has 24 teeth, then each turn of the pedals produces two turns of the rear wheel. This is equivalent to doubling the size of the drive wheel; that is, it is like a directly driven bicycle with a 52-inch wheel. That gear is said to be \"52 gear inches.\"\n\nA bicycle with a 26-inch wheel, a 48-tooth chainring, and a cassette with gears ranging from 11 to 34 teeth has a lowest gear of 26 × 48 / 34 = 37 gear inches and a highest gear of 26 × 48 / 11 = 113 gear inches.\n\nFor bicycles with 700c wheels, some cyclists quote gear inches based on a nominal wheel diameter of 27 inches, corresponding to the old British tire size of 27 x 1¼\" (ETRTO 630). Strictly speaking, the rolling diameter of a 700c wheel may be significantly higher or lower than 27\", depending on the tire size, e.g. nearly 27.5\" for a 700x38 tire, or just over 26\" for a 700x20 tire. This can be the source of some confusion when comparing gears unless it is clear whether gear inches have been calculated using the actual wheel size or a conventionalised 27\".\n\nOne way to estimate wheel diameter is to add twice the nominal tyre cross-section to the rim diameter. For example, consider a 700c × 23 mm tire, which has a nominal cross-section of 23 mm. 700c wheels have a rim diameter of 622 mm. Hence the wheel diameter is (2 × 23 mm) + 622 mm = 668 mm which is equal to 26.3 inches (rounded to 1 decimal place). 26 inch mountain bicycle wheels have a rim diameter of 559 mm. This ignores factors that contribute to the actual rolling radius of the tyre and rim together: the vertical deflection of the tire above the contact patch and the difference between the manufacturer's stated size and the actual tire radius when mounted and inflated.\n\nGear inches, along with cadence, can be converted to speed as follows:\n\nAn equivalent system customarily used by continental European cyclists is metres of development, which measures the distance travelled with each turn of the crank. That is, metres of development is calculated as (normally rounded to one decimal place):\n\nThus gear inches and development differ by a factor of π times imperial-to-metric conversion. To convert from gear inches to metres of development, multiply by 0.08 (more precisely: 0.0254π).\n\nBoth \"gear inches\" and \"metres of development\" are concerned with the distance travelled per turn of the pedals, and are ultimately ways of indicating the mechanical advantage of the drivetrain, but neither of them take into account the length of the crankarm, which can vary from bike to bike. The crankarm is a lever arm. If two bicycles have different crank lengths but are otherwise identical, a longer lever arm gives a greater mechanical advantage. To take this into account, Sheldon Brown proposed a gear measurement system called \"gain ratio,\" which is calculated by the distance travelled by the bike divided by the distance travelled by the pedals during one turn of the crank. He argued that it also has the advantage of being dimensionless.\n\n\n"}

In performance art an artist creates a series of images using sand, a process which is achieved by applying sand to a surface and then rendering images by drawing lines and figures in the sand with one's hands. A sand animation performer will often use the aid of an overhead projector or lightbox (similar to one used by photographers to view translucent films). To make an animated film, sand is moved on a backlit or frontlit piece of glass to create each frame.\n\nTechniques for animating with sand were pioneered by Caroline Leaf when she was an undergraduate art student at Harvard University in 1968. She created her first film, \"Sand, or Peter and the Wolf\" (1968), by dumping beach sand on a light box and manipulating the grains to build figures, textures and movement frame-by-frame. In the 1970s, Eli Noyes, another Harvard graduate, created the noted \"Sandman\" short film (1973) and the \"Sand Alphabet\" (1974) which became a feature on the children's educational television program \"Sesame Street\". In 1977, \"The Sand Castle\" by Dutch-Canadian animator Co Hoedeman won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.

In the 2004 elections, this redistricting supported the Republicans taking a majority of Texas's House seats for the first time since Reconstruction. Opponents challenged the plan in three suits, combined when the case went to the United States Supreme Court in \"League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry\" (2006).\n\nOn June 28, 2006, the Supreme Court upheld the statewide redistricting as constitutional, with the exception of Texas' 23rd congressional district, which it held was racially gerrymandered in violation of Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, apparently to try to protect a Hispanic Republican representative. A three-judge Federal District Court redrew District 23 and four other nearby districts: 15, 21, 25, and 28. In November 2006, a special election was held in the new districts. All incumbents won except in District 23. There, Republican incumbent Henry Bonilla was forced into a December run-off after a jungle primary; he lost to Democratic challenger Ciro Rodriguez.\n\nAfter Republicans won control of the Texas state legislature in 2002 for the first time in 130 years, they intended to work toward establishing a majority of House of Representatives seats from Texas held by their party. After the 2002 election, Democrats had a 17–15 edge in House seats representing Texas or 53% of the seats to Republican's 47%, although the state's voted for Republicans in congressional races 55%-45%. After a protracted partisan struggle, the legislature enacted a new congressional districting map, Plan 1374C, introduced in the Texas House by Representative Phil King of Weatherford. In the 2004 congressional elections, Republicans won 21 seats to the Democrats' 11, which suggested they had considerably surpassed their margin of preference among voters.\n\nOn June 28, 2006, the Supreme Court of the United States issued an opinion that threw out one of the districts in the plan as a violation of the 1965 Voting Rights Act because of racial gerrymandering. It ordered the lower court to produce a remedial plan, which it did in Plan 1440C. The Supreme Court ruling was not considered to seriously threaten Republican gains from the 2004 elections.\n\nThe Texas Legislature had last enacted a Congressional redistrict plan in 1991, following the 1990 census. At the time, Democrats held both the governor's seat (with Ann Richards) and control of both state legislative branches. By the 2000 census, Republicans had recaptured the state executive branch, having elected Governor George W. Bush and Lt. Governor Rick Perry, as well as control of the Texas Senate. Democrats maintained their majority in the Texas House of Representatives.\n\nIn 2001, Democrats and Republicans were unable to agree on new district maps to respond to the latest census. The Republican minority recommended the issue be submitted to a panel of judges, per state law. The judges, being \"hesitant to undo the work of one political party for the benefit of another\", drew a new map which left many of the 1991 districts intact. It yielded a 17 to 15 Democratic majority in Texas's US House delegation after the 2002 elections.\n\nFor Texas House and Senate redistricting, the Texas Constitution provides that the Legislative Redistricting Board (LRB) convenes when the state legislature is unable to approve, for either body, a redistricting plan in the first legislative session following the National Census. In June 2001, the task of redistricting passed to the LRB after the state legislature failed to pass a redistricting plan for either the House or Senate. The LRB consists of five statewide officials, the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House, the Attorney General, the State Comptroller, and the Commissioner of the General Land Office. Four of these five officials were Republican, and the resulting redistricting plans were seen as favorable to Republicans.\n\nIn September 2001, then House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (TX-22) organized Texans for a Republican Majority (TRMPAC), a political action committee designed to gather campaign funds for Republican candidates throughout Texas—in particular with an eye to gaining control of the House Speakership, then held by Democrat Pete Laney. TRMPAC was modeled closely after DeLay's Americans for a Republican Majority (ARMPAC), a federal-level organization created to raise funds for Republicans during the 2000 national elections. Simultaneously, as has been well documented in the media, DeLay played a key role in the ongoing Texas redistricting effort. \n\nIn 2002, after winning a majority of seats in the State House of Representatives, Republicans gained complete control of the legislature. With the urging of Governor Rick Perry and Tom Delay, who had assumed the position of US House Majority Leader in January 2003, the Republican majority introduced legislation to redraw the court-drawn districts from 2001.\n\nLacking sufficient votes to stop the new plan, 52 Democratic members fled the state to prevent a quorum in the Texas House, effectively preventing a vote from taking place during the regular session. The 52 Democrats, known as the \"Killer Ds\", returned to the state when time had expired for the bill. But in the summer of 2003, Governor Rick Perry called a series of special legislative sessions in order to continue the redistricting effort. With control of more than one-third of the seats in the State Senate, the Democrats invoked a two-thirds rule, preventing a vote on the redistricting plan during the first special session. Half an hour after ending the first special session, Governor Perry called a second special session. This time, due to the calendaring of the redistricting bill, the two-thirds rule would not come into play. Eleven of the twelve Democratic state senators left the state to prevent a quorum. The Senators assembled in Albuquerque, New Mexico and were referred to as the Texas Eleven. After a month-long stand off, Senator John Whitmire returned to the State Senate. The redistricting plan was passed in a third special legislative session. After the 2004 elections, Texas' U.S. House delegation had a Republican majority, 21-11, for the first time since Reconstruction. \n\nAn article in the March 6, 2006, issue of \"The New Yorker\" magazine, written by Jeffrey Toobin, quoted Texas's junior Republican Senator John Cornyn as saying, \"Everybody who knows Tom knows that he's a fighter and a competitor, and he saw an opportunity to help the Republicans stay in power in Washington.\" Toobin reported that DeLay left Washington and returned to Texas to oversee the project while final voting was underway in the state legislature, and that \"several times during the long days of negotiating sessions, DeLay personally shuttled proposed maps among House and Senate offices in Austin.\" \"Texas Monthly\" editor Paul Burka, writing in the magazine's May 2006 issue, characterized the measure as \"DeLay's midcensus congressional redistricting plan\" and said, \"[I]n order to increase his Republican majority in Congress, he [DeLay] resorted to a midcensus redistricting plan.\"\n\nAt the time of the 2003 redistricting, Texas was under the pre-clearance requirements of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The State of Texas obtained pre-clearance from the US Department of Justice for its 2003 Congressional redistricting plan.\n\nBut in December 2005, \"The Washington Post\" reported, \"Justice Department lawyers concluded that the landmark Texas congressional redistricting plan spearheaded by Rep. Tom DeLay violated the Voting Rights Act, according to a previously undisclosed memo,\" uncovered by the newspaper. The document, endorsed by six Justice Department attorneys, said\n[T]he redistricting plan illegally diluted black and Hispanic voting power in two congressional districts ... The State of Texas has not met its burden in showing that the proposed congressional redistricting plan does not have a discriminatory effect.\nIn addition, according to the \"Post\", Justice Department lawyers \"found that Republican lawmakers and state officials who helped craft the proposal were aware it posed a high risk of being ruled discriminatory compared with other options\". Texas legislators proceeded with the new plan \"because it would maximize the number of Republican federal lawmakers in the state\".\n\nThe article noted that senior political appointees in the Justice Department had overridden the position and findings by the Civil Rights Division's career civil service staff lawyers and analysts, and approved the redistricting.\n\nDemocrats criticized the 2003 redistricting plan, citing the lack of precedent for redistricting twice in a decade (a so-called \"mid-decade\" redistricting) and argued that it was conducted for purely political gain by the Republican Party. Public comments by some Republicans lent support to this latter claim, since many discussed their expectations of picking up several Republican seats. Some minority groups argued the plan was unconstitutional, as it would dilute their influence and possibly violate the \"one-person-one-vote\" principle of redistricting. Republicans argued that, since most voters in the state were Republicans, that they be represented by a majority-Republican Congressional delegation in Washington.\n\nThe 2004 elections under the new redistricting resulted in Texas Republicans gaining a majority of House seats by a 21–11 margin, nearly a 2/1 ratio in terms of seats (66% of seats). This was significantly larger than the 61/38 voting ratio of Republicans to Democrats in the Presidential race. It was much more lopsided than the total results in the 32 House races, which resulted in 56/40/3 for Republican to Democratic voting (the two main parties did not both run candidates in four districts).\n\nThe US Supreme Court issued an opinion on the case in \"League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry\" on June 28, 2006. While the Court said states are free to redistrict as often as desired, the justices ruled that Texas's 23rd congressional district was invalid, as it violated Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act by racial gerrymandering. This decision required lawmakers to adjust boundaries in line with the Court's ruling.\n\nA three-judge panel, under an order from the U.S. Court of Appeals, oversaw the redistricting. On June 29, 2006, a U.S. District Judge ordered both sides to submit proposed maps by July 14, respond to their opponents' maps by July 21, and be prepared to hold oral arguments on August 3.\n\nThe 2003 redistricting targeted ten districts with white Democratic incumbents, avoiding the seven districts with minority Democratic incumbents.\n\n\nThe redistricting appeared intended to protect Henry Bonilla, a Hispanic Republican of TX-23. He had faced a stiff challenge from conservative Democrat Henry Cuellar in 2002. It also neutralized liberal Democrat Ciro Rodriguez. This was done by putting the two Democrats in the same district and forcing them to run against each other for the Democratic nomination (Cuellar won). \n\nIn 2006, however, the Supreme Court ruling required redrawing the boundaries for TX-23. It resulted in a special election, in which Bonilla faced six Democratic candidates and an independent in a jungle primary. He was defeated by Democrat Ciro Rodriguez in the run-off.\n\n\n"}

In fact, when asked about his lack of Navy experience when named to the post in 1949, Matthews replied, \"\"Well, I do have a rowboat at my summer home.\"\"\nMatthews assumed office at a time of internal turmoil in the Department of Defense resulting from significant post-World War II funding reductions and controversial decisions on pre-Korean War defense priorities by the Truman administration as outlined and executed by SECDEF Johnson. One of the most contentious was that of service unification and the roles and missions of each of the U.S. armed services. In order to fund his postwar domestic spending agenda, Truman had advocated a policy of defense program cuts for the armed forces at the end of the war, and the Republican Party majority in the Congress, anxious to enact numerous tax cuts, approved of Truman's plan to \"hold the line\" on defense spending. In addition, Truman's previous experience in the Senate during World War II had left him with lingering suspicions that large sums had been, and were continuing to be, wasted in the Pentagon. Impressed by U.S. advances in nuclear weapons development, both Truman and Johnson had initially believed that the atomic bomb had rendered all conventional military forces, particularly naval forces (e.g., the Navy and the Marine Corps), largely irrelevant to the modern battlefield, thus justifying cuts to all but strategic nuclear forces that largely resided in the U.S. Air Force and the Strategic Air Command. Matthews also ascribed to this view and it became the cornerstone of postwar U.S. defense policy prior to the establishment of the communist nation of East Germany by the Soviet Union in its occupation zone of Germany in 1949 and the outbreak of hostilities in Korea in 1950.\n\nOne of the key events of Matthews' time at the Department of the Navy prior to the start of the Korean War was the so-called \"Revolt of the Admirals\" in 1949, an intense controversy between the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force over funding and strategic roles, of which the cancellation of the supercarrier USS \"United States\" and the resignation of former SECNAV Sullivan had been a catalyst. The Air Force, its senior leadership consisting of mainly bomber generals, wanted control of the strategic nuclear bombing role and control of all U.S. military aircraft as well. It argued that the Navy's aircraft carriers were obsolete and the Air Force did not want the Navy (to include that portion of Naval Aviation organic to the Marine Corps) to have its own \"competing\" air force. The Navy wanted to continue Naval Aviation in both the Navy and Marine Corps and build much larger aircraft carriers to handle the larger, heavier and more powerful jet fighter and heavy attack (e.g., nuclear bomber) aircraft coming into service. Such a carrier, the Navy argued, could also play a strategic role in nuclear deterrence. The flush-deck carriers planned (known as \"supercarriers\") were the forerunner of the modern nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.\n\nIn the post-World War II period prior to the Korean War, the Air Force wanted funding to focus on the massive Convair B-36 bomber for the Strategic Air Command (SAC). In the restrictive defense funding environment following World War II demobilization, this focus on the B-36 would be at the expense of aircraft carriers and Naval Aviation, as well as the Marine Corps and its amphibious assault role which Truman, Johnson and Matthews all saw as obsolete. Top Navy and Marine Corps leaders publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with the Defense Department's plans and policies in this regard, and several senior admirals, including the Navy's top admiral, ADM Louis E. Denfeld, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), were forced by Matthews to resign and retire, or did so in protest.\n\nThe House Armed Services Committee (HASC) condemned the dismissal of ADM Denfield, who accepted cancellation of the supercarrier, but testified critically on defense planning and the administration of defense unification as it applied to the Navy and Marine Corps. Following Denfield's congressional testimony, Matthews fired Denfeld as CNO on 27 October 1949, explaining that he and Denfeld disagreed widely on strategic policy and unification. However, the HASC concluded that Denfeld's removal was a political reprisal by Matthews because of his testimony and therefore a challenge to effective representative government.\n\nMatthews' perceived vindictiveness towards much of the U.S. Navy's uniformed senior leadership during his tenure as SECNAV led to a perception by both the American public and the U.S. Congress of the Navy's civilian leadership woes, a perception that also did not go totally unnoticed by the news media of the period. As \"The Washington Daily News\" reported at the time, \"\"Secretary of the Navy Matthews does not have the confidence of the Navy and can not win it...Moreover, Mr. Matthews has forfeited the confidence of Congress by firing Admiral Denfeld.\"\" \n\nMatthews served as SECNAV from 1949 through the first year of the Korean War. During his two years in office, the federal government had to suddenly reverse previous policy and massively increase defense spending to meet international crises on the Korean peninsula and in Europe, this following nearly four years of significant cutbacks in the U.S. military, especially in conventional (e.g., non-strategic / non-nuclear strike) forces. All of the U.S. armed forces were under major strain as they simultaneously tried to meet the demands of a hot war in Asia and an intensive defense build-up in support of NATO in Western Europs.\n\nMatthews actions as Secretary of the Navy were always aligned with those of his immediate superior, the Secretary of Defense, Louis Johnson, and when he was initially appointed as SECDEF, Johnson met President Truman's needs, especially in the realm of: (1) imposing economy measures on the U.S. military following the end of World War II and (2) placing a near total reliance on the strategic nuclear forces of the Air Force over the conventional forces of the Navy, Marine Corps and Army.\n\nBut by September 1950, with the Korean War in full swing, the fiscal situation with respect to defense spending had totally reversed and the need for robust conventional forces had become readily apparent. As a result, Louis Johnson became a political liability to the Truman Administration and he resigned as SECDEF at President Truman's request on 19 September 1950, the President replacing him with retired General of the Army George C. Marshall. As a protégé of Johnson, Matthews was similarly perceived as a liability in a now radically changed budgetary and national defense environment. Under political pressure from the Truman administration, Matthews also resigned as Secretary of the Navy in July 1951 to become Ambassador to Ireland, the home of his ancestors.\n\nMatthews became United States Ambassador to Ireland as a political appointee, having no prior foreign service or diplomatic experience. He was appointed in July 1951, and took up his post in October 1951. While serving as ambassador, Matthews died on October 18, 1952, during a visit to his home in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nAlthough Matthews was a prominent Omaha banker and lawyer, and an even more prominent Roman Catholic layman, little attention has been paid to his career outside of his tenure as SECNAV, since it is in this capacity that he had the greatest institutional impact. In some arenas as SECNAV, he was successful, such as his efforts to integrate minorities into the mainstream of the Navy and Marine Corps via actions such as ALNAV 49-447, which mandated, \"...equal opportunity for all personnel in the Navy/Marine Corps without regard of race, color, religion or national origin,\" and his 1950 policy statement prohibiting, \"...discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin in enlistment, appointment, promotion, or assignment...\" of Navy and Marine Corps personnel.\n\nBut it is Matthews' lack of advocacy for both the Navy and Marine Corps in terms of roles and missions that he had sworn an oath as SECNAV to support that has driven the vast majority of derision to his legacy. To be sure, Matthews was in many respects following orders from SECDEF Louis A. Johnson, with the SECDEF himself following orders from President Truman to cut the defense budget in the years following the end of World War II and prior to the start of Korean War, the latter marking the true rise of the Cold War in earnest. As former reserve component Army officers (e.g., Army Reserve for Johnson and Army National Guard for Truman) who were mobilized to active duty and served in Europe during World War I, both Truman and Johnson were endemically predisposed to support of the Army and, to a lesser extent, an Army supported by an Air Force that had evolved from it.\n\nThe Air Force's, specifically the Strategic Air Command's, argument that it could provide relatively inexpensive (from a postwar budgetary perspective) national security via deterrence of a potential adversary, e.g., the Soviet Union, solely with nuclear weapons delivered by heavy bomber aircraft such as the B-36 Peacemaker was particularly persuasive. The notion of any conflict involving the United States below the nuclear threshold had not yet entered strategic thinking or the defense planning lexicon, while the Army and the Air Force basically saw threats to their postwar defense budget share from the Marine Corps and Navy, respectively.\n\nInserted into this was Matthews, having had no prior military experience, let alone naval experience, and viewed with disdain as an unqualified and unsupportive Johnson sycophant by most senior Navy and Marine Corps officers of the time. Matthews never made any attempt to bridge this gap, a gap that would later be exacerbated by his politically-motivated termination of a serving Chief of Naval Operations and glaringly noted by both the Congress and the news media of the day. Due to Matthews' actions and inactions, the bitterness between the Navy and the Marine Corps versus the Air Force and the Army would fester and take many years to go away. Indeed, as late as the early 21st century, there remain many retired Navy and Marine Corps officers who resent the way their services were treated by the Army and the Air Force in the late 1940s, combined with Matthews' systemic failure to counter it, and it has remained a touchstone in the professional education of subsequent generations of officers in the Navy and Marine Corps, especially those in Naval Aviation, in the decades since. It is for this primary reason that Matthews' tenure as SECNAV is considered to be mediocre by some and an abject failure by others.\n\nMatthews served as the 8th Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus from 1939 to 1945. He was nominated for the position in 1937 while serving as Deputy Supreme Knight, but declined the nomination.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1822818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822818", "title": "First Communion", "text": "First Communion\n\nFirst Communion is a ceremony in some Christian traditions during which a person first receives the Eucharist. It is most common in many parts of the Latin Church tradition of the Catholic Church, Lutheran Church and Anglican Communion (other ecclesiastical provinces of these denominations administer a congregant's First Communion after he/she receives confirmation). In churches that celebrate First Communion, it typically occurs between the ages of seven and thirteen, often acting as a rite of passage. In other denominations, such as the Methodist Church in India, one's first communion ordinarily follows the reception of confirmation, which occurs after the age of ten; Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Christians first receive the sacrament of Holy Communion in infancy, along with Holy Baptism and Chrismation.\n\nCatholics believe this event to be very important, as the Eucharist occupies a central role in Catholic theology and practice.\n\nFirst Communion is not celebrated in the Eastern Orthodox churches, the Oriental Orthodox churches or the Assyrian Church of the East, as they practice infant communion (which often is simultaneously administered with infant baptism and confirmation). Some Anglicans allow infant communion, while others require the previous reception of confirmation, usually during the teenage years.\n\nThe celebration of this ceremony is typically less elaborate in many Protestant churches. Catholics and some Protestants believe that Christ is truly present in the Eucharist; Roman Catholics believe this is through transubstantiation, Lutherans believe that this is through a sacramental union, Methodists believe that the way Christ is made manifest in the Eucharistic elements is a Holy Mystery, while the Reformed affirm a pneumatic presence.\n\nOther denominations have varying understandings, such as the Eucharist being a symbolic meal and means of remembering Christ's last supper.\n\nThe sacrament of First Communion is an important tradition for Catholic families and individuals. For Latin Church Catholics, Holy Communion is usually the third of seven sacraments received; it occurs only after receiving Baptism, and once the person has reached the age of reason (usually, around the second grade). First confession (the first sacrament of penance) must precede one's first reception of the Eucharist. For those entering into the Catholic Church as adults, Confirmation occurs immediately before first Communion. In 1910, Pope Pius X issued the decree \"Quam singulari\", which changed the age at which First Communion is taken to 7 years old. Previously, local standards had been 10 or 12 or even 14 years old. Byzantine Catholics celebrate the sacraments of baptism, confirmation (Chrismation), and Holy Communion on the same day as an infant's baptism.\n\nTraditions of celebration surrounding First Communion usually include large family gatherings and parties to celebrate the event. The first communicant wears special clothing. The clothing is often white to symbolize purity, but not in all cultures. Often, a girl wears a fancy dress and a veil attached to a chaplet of flowers or some other hair ornament. In other communities, girls commonly wear dresses passed down to them from sisters or mothers, or even simply their school uniforms with the veil or wreath. Boys may wear a suit and tie, tuxedo, their Sunday best, or national dress, with embroidered armbands worn on the left arm and occasionally white gloves.\n\nIn many Latin American countries, boys wear military-style dress uniforms with gold braid aiguillettes. In Switzerland, both boys and girls wear plain white robes with brown wooden crosses around their necks. In Spain, Germany, Luxembourg, Austria, and Guam, girls are dressed up as little brides, although this has been partly replaced by albs in recent times.\n\nIn Scotland, boys traditionally wear kilts and other traditional Scottish dress which accompany the kilt. In the Philippines, First Communion services often occur on or around the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (the country's patron saint), with boys donning either the Barong Tagalog or semi-formal Western dress, and girls a plain white dress and sometimes a veil.\n\nGifts of a religious nature are usually given, such as Bibles, children's or teenager's daily devotional books, rosaries, prayer books, religious statues, icons, and holy cards. Monetary gifts are also common.\n\nMany families have formal professional photographs taken in addition to candid snapshots in order to commemorate the event. Some churches arrange for a professional photographer after the ceremony.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1822836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822836", "title": "Battle of Inverkeithing", "text": "Battle of Inverkeithing\n\nThe Battle of Inverkeithing in Inverkeithing, Scotland was a battle during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. It was fought on 20 July 1651 between an English Parliamentarian army under John Lambert and a Scottish Covenanter army acting on behalf of Charles II, led by Sir John Brown of Fordell. Lambert's force was a seaborne expedition landed at Fife to get around the main Scottish position at Stirling. The battle resulted in a decisive English victory that gave Oliver Cromwell's forces control of the Firth of Forth and outflanked the defensive position of the main Scottish Army under David Leslie.\n\nAfter his victory at the Battle of Dunbar, Oliver Cromwell went on to occupy large parts of southern Scotland. David Leslie, commanding the royalist forces, in recovering from the disaster at Dunbar, created a series of defensive redoubts in the centre of the country, effectively preventing the New Model Army from making any further progress in the campaign. Unable to push past Leslie, firmly entrenched at Stirling, Cromwell was quick to realise that Fife, on the northern shore of the Firth of Forth, was now the key of the whole campaign. Once across the Forth the English would be able to march on Perth and cut the Scots lines of communication with their northern hinterland, now essential for both supplies and recruits.\n\nA seaborne invasion of Fife was a tricky operation. Early in 1651 the Council of State, the executive authority of the Commonwealth, had ordered the construction of special flat bottomed boats, which arrived in Leith in April. While this would enable men and horses to be ferried in close to the northern shore, it would take time for the army to land in sufficient strength to fight off a counter-attack. Leslie could easily move sufficient forces from his base at Stirling to throw the invaders back into the sea. Or, alternatively, he could wait for enough Englishmen to cross to Fife before falling on the weakened remnant at Edinburgh, and then sweep south towards England. This was a considerable risk; but the only alternative was another winter of war, which neither the Lord-General nor his men can have viewed with much enthusiasm.\n\nThe Firth was to be crossed at its narrowest point, between North and South Queensferry, spanned today by the road and rail bridges. A landing here offered another advantage, besides speed: North Queensferry stands on a narrow peninsula, which offered good prospects of building up a defensive bridgehead against an enemy attack. After the local defences were softened up by a bombardment of the forts at Inchgarvie, Burntisland and Ferryhill, Colonel Robert Overton led an assault party across on the night of 16/17 July, landing on the eastern side of the Ferry Peninsula at Inverkeithing Bay. By the morning almost 2000 troops were on the northern shores of the Forth, and Overton at once set about constructing entrenchments. Reinforcements were sent across with Major-General John Lambert two days later, bringing the army's strength to about 4500 men by the morning of 20 July.\n\nNo sooner had the Scots heard of the landing than a force of about 4000 was detached from the main army to counter the threat: 1000 cavalry under the command of James Holborne of Menstrie, Highland infantry under the command of Sir Hector Maclean of Duart and some lowland regiments of infantry and cavalry under the command of Sir John Brown. The detachment was placed under the overall command of Sir John Brown of Fordell. Brown's orders were simple: to prevent Lambert breaking out of his bridgehead.\n\nIt is possible that Cromwell at first saw the Fife operation as no more than a diversion, intended to unlock the Scots' position at Stirling. While the landings were taking place he approached Leslie's camp with his remaining force. Seeing Leslie march off in support of Brown, he then moved quickly across the hills, through Bannockburn and on to the vacated camp at Torwood. A little to his north Cromwell found that his further progress was blocked by the enemy, now occupying a strong position in an area known as the King's Park. Unable to make any headway, Cromwell withdrew by nightfall. It was now up to Lambert.\n\nThe Ferry Peninsula is separated from the rest of Fife by narrow isthmus, about a quarter of a mile wide. From the low-lying land of the isthmus and the surrounding shore, the centre is dominated by the Ferry Hills, rising two hundred and forty feet above sea level. Beyond the peninsula, to the north-west, the ground rises up again to Castland Hill and its neighbour Meickle Hill, between which the road runs inland through the narrow valley to Dunfermline. These two hills also command the coastal route to Rosyth and the road running towards the village of Inverkeithing. If the Scots occupied this position it would be impossible for the English to make any forward move. The Scots' army advanced through these hills on the 20th; but for reasons that are not entirely clear, Brown was attracted down from the heights to the lower ground close to the isthmus, looking across to the English entrenchments on the Ferry Hills.\n\nRealising the danger they had placed themselves in, the Scots began to wheel as if to move back slightly on to the higher ground. Lambert at once sent Colonel John Oakey and his dragoons forward to attack their rear. Faced with this threat Brown had no choice but to form a line of battle on the Whins, three eminences rolling outwards from Castland and Meickle towards Inverkeithing Bay, and across the valley in the direction of Rosyth Castle. Lambert made his own dispositions. The ground on his left was difficult and rocky, so he concentrated his greatest strength on the right: his own cavalry regiment, two troops of dragoons and another two troops of horse, all under the command of Colonel Oakey. The infantry were placed in the centre and the left, where they were supported by the remaining dragoons and cavalry. Robert Overton took command of a reserve infantry force stationed to the rear.\n\nLambert waited, expecting to be attacked at any moment; but for an hour and a half nothing happened. By now he had received news that Cromwell had fallen back on Linlithgow, and that the enemy might at any time receive reinforcements. This was the moment to act. His army moved forward, keeping formation as it squeezed through the bottleneck of the isthmus. The Scots lancers in the valley swept downwards towards the infantry on the left, cutting through the thin ranks with ease. Seeing the danger, Lambert responded by swinging round his infantry reserve, supported by a troop of horse, which thrust into the flank of the advancing Scots before they were able to change front. Against the fire of the musketeers, and the long reach of the English pikemen, the lancers had no chance. Within a quarter of an hour the fight on this side of the field was over.\n\nLambert was now free to concentrate on attacking the main part of the Scottish army around the Whins. Against the ferocious discipline of the New Model Army the green Scottish recruits had little chance. Soon a large part of the army fled in terror, leaving Brown to face the onslaught of the enemy right with only 200 horse and two battalions of infantry. He was completely overwhelmed. Lambert's men occupied the heights, and the Scots were driven back to the level ground between Hillfield and Pitreavie. Here, in one of the most famous episodes of the battle of Inverkeithing, the Clan Maclean of Mull regiment, commanded by their chief, Sir Hector, surrounded by superior enemy forces, fought fiercely in defence of their chief, calling out, \"\"Fear eile airson Eachainn!\"\" (Another for Hector!), as they sacrificed themselves.\n\nLambert claimed to have killed 2,000 of the enemy and captured 1,400. Clan Maclean tradition says that their contingent began the battle with 800 men and only 35 survived. However, Sir James Balfour, a senior officer in the Covenanter army, wrote in his journal that about 800 Scots were killed in total, of whom no more than 100 were from Clan Maclean. Lambert's own loss was under 200 men.\n\nFour days later Cromwell crossed to Fife in person. For him the victory was \"an unspeakable mercy\".\n\nAlthough far smaller than Dunbar, the Battle of Inverkeithing was the decisive encounter of Cromwell's Scottish war. It ended a long strategic deadlock, giving the English command of the plains of Fife and the north-east. Leslie was completely outmanoeuvred. By shifting the thrust of his offensive to the northern shore of the Forth, Cromwell deliberately dropped his guard in the south. He reckoned that King Charles could not resist the lure of a march into England; and once in the open the enemy could be destroyed. Charles obliged and soon began a march that took him south to Worcester and destruction of his army at the Battle of Worcester.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1822857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822857", "title": "191st Street station", "text": "191st Street station\n\n191st Street is a station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of St. Nicholas Avenue and 191st Street in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, it is served at all times by the 1 train. It is the deepest station in the New York City Subway system—about below street level. Access to the station's main entrance is only provided by four elevators to the mezzanine. A pedestrian tunnel also extends west from the station to Broadway, connecting it with the Fort George neighborhood.\n\nBuilt by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), the station opened on January 14, 1911, as an infill station along the first subway. Even though the line through the area had opened five years earlier, no station was constructed at this location because the surrounding neighborhood had a lower population than other areas of Manhattan. Before the opening of the pedestrian tunnel two years later, the area's hilly topography made it hard for area residents to access the station. The opening of the station and the tunnel led to the development of the surrounding area, including the construction of apartment buildings. Hundreds of lots held by the Bennett family since 1835 were sold at an auction in 1919. These provided additional housing opportunities for the middle class, taking advantage of the area's improved transportation access.\n\nIn 2018, the station had 2,526,932 boardings, making it the 186th most used station in the -station system.\n\nThe West Side Branch of the first subway, which was constructed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), was extended northward from 157th Street to a temporary terminus on 221st Street and Broadway on March 12, 1906. There was no station at 191st Street. With the construction of the line, the population in Washington Heights grew rapidly. It was determined that a station should be built at 191st Street to bridge the gap between the 181st Street and Dyckman Street stations, which had become overcrowded. A station had not been deemed necessary as this area of Manhattan was less densely populated, and it was thought that there was no need to have stations as close together as they were downtown.\n\nThe opening of the station was expected to spur development in the Fort George area. Its original sponsor was David Stewart. He and other property owners had pushed for the station's construction seeking better accessibility to their land. Following the announcement of the station's construction, and before it began, interest in nearby real estate, having been nonexistent in the previous two years, increased.\n\nConstruction of the station began on July 20, 1909. Work on new shafts started on August 18, 1909, after legal and engineering difficulties were straightened out in the previous months. Preliminary work involved the clearing of a site in a vacant lot south of 191st Street on the west side of St. Nicholas Avenue for a shaft deep. More than of rock was blasted and removed from the shaft. It was designed to accommodate four elevators and a steel emergency staircase from the surface to platform level. The four elevator wells were in the four corners of the main shaft with the staircase between them. The emergency staircase, along with those at the 168th Street and 181st Street stations, whose platforms were also accessed mainly by elevators, were used for the first time on March 23, 1914, after the elevators stopped working due to a problem at the Dyckman power station. This resulted in extreme congestion.\n\nConstruction of the station proved difficult. It required the sinking of a shaft and the widening of the tunnel bore on both sides to accommodate the platforms; this was accomplished without interrupting subway service. The station platforms were constructed by building two new tunnels alongside the existing tunnel, and connecting them once the platforms were complete. Blasting for the station was limited to between midnight and 5:00 a.m. when subway service was less frequent. The station platforms were designed to be to accommodate 10-car express trains. Originally, part of the old tunnel arch was to be used for the station roof. However, the discovery of a mud seam, and the development of cracks in the roof, made it necessary to build a flat roof over the tracks, and filling in the space between the arch and the roof with concrete.\n\nAlong with the construction of the station, a tunnel was built to connect the station at 191st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue with Broadway, west of Fairview Avenue. James A. Lynch, counsel for many subway contractors, recommended the construction of a tunnel street to provide better access to the station, and convinced local property owners and the city to fund it. The tunnel street cost $76,000, with $5,000 provided by the IRT and the remainder levied on the neighborhood property owners at their request. Engineers found the construction of the tunnel was feasible since the subway platforms would be on almost the same level as Broadway. \n\nOn October 5, 1909, the Board of Improvements of Washington Heights approved plans for the construction of a tunnel to Riverside Drive. Three entrances to the tunnel were proposed at Broadway, Fort Washington Avenue, and Riverside Drive. The entrances to Broadway and Riverside Drive would have been located at street-level, as the tunnel was to be at the same elevation as the streets at these locations. Two elevators would be required for the entrance to Fort Washington Avenue, which was located at a higher elevation. The tunnel would have been bored from both sides, and was expected to be completed within 14 months.\n\nSince the tunnel was to be located underneath private property, easements had to be obtained to allow for its construction. They were acquired in a proceeding under a provision of the City Charter, not under the terms of the Rapid Transit Act. In June 1910, the local board of directors sent a resolution calling for the construction of the street tunnel to the New York City Board of Estimate (NYCBOE). At the time, funding had been acquired for slightly more than half the length of the tunnel, with the remainder expected to be secured by easements. The NYCBOE approved the petition for the improvement and agreed to hold a public hearing on December 29, 1910. Unlike other streets in the city, easements were only acquired to a height of above the tunnel. In January, construction was expected to begin that summer. The contract for the underground street was let on September 9, 1911, and was awarded to the Bell-Ross Contracting Company, headed by Roswell D. Williams, on September 25. The company was given a year to finish the work, but expected to complete it in nine months. In October 1911, construction of the tunnel was expected to be completed on April 1, 1912; construction began in January 1912.\n\nIn December 1911, the local Board of Improvements authorized plans to extend the tunnel west at grade across Broadway and Bennett Avenue and to tunnel to a point underneath Fort Washington Avenue, the highest point in Manhattan, where elevators would take passengers to the surface. An extension of the tunnel was expected to lead quickly to development in the area. As such, an extension was discussed and questions were raised concerning which agency would operate the elevators. In June 1912, blasting on the tunnel was completed, with its expected opening date being September 1912. To cut down the danger of accidents, the contractors sank a shaft halfway up the hill and tunneled east to the subway station and west to Broadway.\n\nThe tunnel opened on March 8, 1913. At a ceremony for the tunnel's opening, Manhattan Borough President George McAneny, Commissioner Williams of the Public Service Commission and other officials unanimously allowed the street to be named Tunnel Street. The tunnel was also intended to be used as an easy way for pedestrians to get to St. Nicholas Avenue at the top of the hill; pedestrians were allowed to use the elevators free of charge. A new ticket booth opened on May 18, 1913. On December 31, 1913, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court issued a decision denying a revision to the awards made for the easements for the tunnel's construction. Since it was very windy at both entrances to the tunnel, storm doors were later installed at either end of the tunnel.\n\nAt its connection to the subway station elevator, it is below the surface. The tunnel was built underneath a steep hill to save people a walk of a quarter to one-third of a mile (0.40 to 0.54 km) and a steep climb. Before the tunnel opened, riders used circuitous routes to get to either the Dyckman Street or 181st Street stations. The tunnel provided better access westward to the Hudson River in the valley between 187th Street and Nagle Avenue. The tunnel was built to be wide and high in the center, with sides, and an arched roof with a radius of . The tunnel was built of concrete reinforced with steel, and excavated through solid rock, except for at the street end of the tunnel, which was built as a roofed-over cut. The tunnel's construction was expected to increase development in this area of Manhattan as the difficult terrain would no longer be a deterrent. The underground street remains the only one of its kind in Manhattan. The tunnel was lined with glazed tile, lit for its entire length, and guarded at all times. It had a stationary post where a policeman was always on duty. Policemen were stationed at either end of the tunnel. The tunnel's grade from the steps at the Broadway entrance to the subway platform is one percent to allow water used in cleaning that collects around the walls to drain through a sewer to the subway. The difference between the two ends is .\n\nThe approach to the entrance through the building at the southwest corner of 191st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue was rebuilt by the Morgenthau Realty Company in conjunction with the construction of a building at this location. In November 1916, work on rebuilding the station entrance was completed.\n\nAs of June 1910, the station was expected to open in the coming fall. On July 18, 1910, several tons of rail fell through the roof of the tunnel onto the northbound track after an overcharge of powder was set off, nearly seriously injuring a dozen workers. The accident delayed service for two hours. Although not fully completed, the 191st Street station opened to the public on January 14, 1911. The ticket booths, which were to be in vestibules at street level, had not been finished, and temporary booths for the sale of tickets were built and put in the mezzanine. A special train with guests, including top IRT officials and Henry Morgenthau, ran from 137th Street to the station. By the time the station opened, several apartment buildings had been completed, though some lots still remained available for development. In the words of \"The New York Times\", \"prior to the opening of the 191st Street subway station ... no high-class residential building was to be found north of 187th Street.\" The newspaper expected the Fort George area to become one of the \"choicest\" apartment areas of the city.\n\nIn January and February 1912, work was completed on the station finish, and a small amount of work was done toward the completion of the elevators. Construction of the station cost $381,000 and was done as a modification to Contract 1 between New York City and the IRT for the construction of the first subway. Space for four elevators in one shaft was included in the station going down to the mezzanine, however, only two of the elevators were installed. The remaining elevators were to be added once ridership at the station justified it. These elevators rise to the surface on a plot given to the city by the Henry Morgenthau Company. The elevators were lent out to one of the company's buildings, which was completed at the end of 1916. The Henry Morgenthau Company was involved in real estate development and had profited from the increasing value land around the station. In 1915, the station's users complained to the IRT about elevator service, noting there was often a five, six and sometimes a ten-minute wait for an elevator. At the time, except during a few hours at night and in the early morning, there was only one elevator operator.\n\nWithin a year after the station opened, the walls were black and stained, ironwork was covered in rust, and portions of cement in the walls and ceiling had crumbled away due to water damage. The rock-bed above the station consisted of clay and shale, which allowed surface water to seep into the station. A similar problem occurred at the 181st Street station, and it took time to fix the leaks and waterproof that station. Drains were installed in this station and leaks were made watertight. These temporary fixes were made until the city's construction of the pedestrian tunnel was completed. On January 3, 1912, IRT officials hinted that if the problems could not be fixed, the station would be eliminated. The problems were eventually fixed.\n\nOn June 10, 1919, 500 lots in Washington Heights owned by the Bennett Family since 1835 were sold to the highest bidder. The land sale was expected to provide additional housing opportunities for the middle class. The construction of a new station in between the 181st Street and 191st Street stations, similar to the construction of the 191st Street station, with entrances at 186th Street and 187th Street, was expected to relieve projected overcrowding at those two stops. It would also serve the development of the Broadway block, bounded by Broadway, Bennett Avenue, and 187th Street, that was owned by the Bennett Family. A tunnel would have connected the deep station to Riverside Drive and Fort Washington Avenue. The construction of the stop was considered a \"practical certainty.\"\n\nOn August 13, 1925, the New York City Board of Transportation (NYCBOT) announced two additional elevators would be added to the station as ridership had increased with the opening of the George Washington High School. It opened in February 1925, adding 3,500 more daily passengers to those already using the station. The elevators at the stop handled 2,001 passengers a day in 1915, increasing by 200% to 5,187 in 1925. Bids for the project were received on August 28, with construction expected to be completed eight months after the contract was awarded. On October 14, 1925, the $107,865 contract was awarded to the Otis Elevator Company; the bid was the only one received. The NYCBOT found that other firms did not compete in the bidding as they were unable to meet the requirement that elevators be equipped with floor leveling safety devices. The elevators opened on September 16, 1926, coinciding with the start of classes at George Washington High School. Their installation required additional power supply.\n\nIn 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to to allow full ten-car express trains to stop. Unlike the other stations being extended on the line, the 191st Street station could already accommodate 10-car trains. However, because it was only , not all doors would open at the station. On April 6, 1948, the platform extension project was completed for stations from 103rd Street to Dyckman Street, with the exception of 125th Street.\n\nOn December 28, 1950, the NYCBOT issued a report concerning the feasibility of constructing bomb shelters in the subway system. Five deep stations in Washington Heights, including the 191st Street station, were considered ideal for use as bomb-proof shelters. The program was estimated to cost $104 million. The shelters were expected to provide limited protection against conventional bombs, while protecting against shock waves and air blasts, as well the heat and radiation from an atomic bomb. To become suitable as shelters, the stations would require water-supply facilities, first-aid rooms, and additional bathrooms. However, the program, which required federal funding, was never completed.\n\nDuring fiscal year 1962, two of the station's elevators were replaced. Funding for the rehabilitation of the other two elevators was initially provided in the 1976 New York State budget, but was reallocated. $940,000 would have been required to improve these elevators and those at 181st Street on the IND Eighth Avenue Line. In 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) listed the 191st Street station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. On May 18, 1983, bids for the rehabilitation of elevators at the two stops were put out to tender.\n\nOn August 21, 1989, with the start of 1/ weekday skip-stop service, 1 trains began skipping this station between 6:30 am and 7:00 pm, while 9 trains served the station during these times. On September 4, 1994, midday skip-stop service was discontinued, and 191st Street was no longer a skip-stop station. Skip-stop service ended on May 27, 2005.\n\nIn 2001, the nonprofit group Upper Manhattan Together made it a priority to improve the 191st Street station. At the time, passengers had to wait on long lines to get to the platforms since only one or two of the elevators at the station usually worked. The group had persuaded the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) to paint and improve the lighting in the pedestrian tunnel, and turned their attention to the station's elevators. According to an MTA spokesperson, three elevators were supposed to be running during rush hours—one of the elevators was being renovated, with a second to be done later. They also stated the station would be completely overhauled in 2003. The station and pedestrian tunnel were closed between July 1 and December 31, 2003, for the renovation project. The $15 million renovation was done by New York City Transit crews in-house. As part of the project, the station's elevators were upgraded. New lighting, ceramic wall tiles, granite floor tiles, and a new public information system were installed, and steel and concrete supports were repaired. All of the deteriorating tiles and mosaics were replaced with exact reproductions made by Serpentile. The token booth was moved to the opposite wall as part of the project.\n\nIn July 2003, to reduce costs, the MTA announced that as part of its 2004 budget it would eliminate 22 elevator operator positions at this station and four others in Washington Heights, leaving one full-time operator per station. The agency had intended removing all the attendants at these stops, but kept one in each station after many riders protested. The change saved $1.2 million a year, after taking effect on January 20, 2004. MTA employees had joined riders in worrying about an increase in crime as a result of the cuts after an elevator operator at 181st Street helped save a stabbed passenger. In November 2007, as part of a savings cuts plan, the MTA planned to remove all the attendants, saving $1.7 million a year. On December 7, 2007, the MTA announced the plan was being shelved due to pushback from elected officials and area residents. In October 2018, the MTA again proposed removing the elevator operators at the five stations, but this decision was reversed after dissent from the Transport Workers Union.\n\nThe elevator attendants currently serve as a way to reassure passengers as the elevators are the primary access to the platforms; passengers often wait for them with an attendant. The attendants at the five stations are primarily maintenance and cleaning workers who have suffered injuries that made it hard for them to continue doing their original jobs.\n\nThe elevators at this station will be closed and replaced between February 2020 and February 2021, though the station will remain open via the exit to Broadway. It is unclear whether the elevator operators will keep their jobs after the elevators' replacement, although the MTA is committed to retaining the operators. The new elevators will be able to accommodate increased egress. While the elevators were closed, the temporary M191 shuttle bus service was operated between the Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue entrances.\n\nThe 191st Street station has two tracks and two side platforms. Above the platforms is a mezzanine and covered pedestrian footbridges connecting the two platforms; people on the footbridges cannot see the tracks and platforms (and vice versa). The mezzanine and footbridges are finished in glazed white tile and ceramic sheet marble. The station ceiling is supported by 34 steel columns encased in concrete.\n\nAt approximately below street level, it is the deepest station in the New York City Subway system. In 1947, Victor Hess, who won the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of cosmic rays, wrote to the NYCBOT asking if he could use the station \"to carry out experiments on the radiation emitted from rocks at a location well protected from cosmic rays.\" Ultimately, Hess was allowed to conduct his experiments in the nearby 190th Street station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line, which is also far below ground. Despite the depth of the 191st Street station, the next station north, Dyckman Street, is just above ground level. This is because 191st Street is at nearly the highest point on the island of Manhattan and this station is deep in the Washington Heights Mine Tunnel, while Dyckman Street runs along a deep valley almost at sea level and its station is at the tunnel portal. The 191st Street station is actually at a higher elevation above sea level than the Dyckman Street station is.\n\nAs part of the MTA's Arts for Transit Program, during the station's 2003 renovation, $88,360 was allocated for the creation and installation of a mosaic tile piece of art titled \"Primavera\" by Raul Colon.\n\nThere are two entrances/exits from this station via the same fare control. The main entrance/exit at the southwest corner of 191st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue is at the summit of a hill and accessible only by a set of four elevators. The elevators to the mezzanine still utilize elevator operators—one of the few stations in the system to do so. The other entrance/exit, at 190th Street and Broadway west of the station, is located at a hillside and is accessed via a three-block long passageway, which passes under Wadsworth Terrace and Avenue. The station is not compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and thus cannot be used by patrons with wheelchairs, because access from the fare control area to the platforms is only possible via stairways.\n\nThe passageway between the station's Broadway entrance and the station itself is not maintained by the MTA, despite being marked as a subway entrance. It is a property of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, and is officially called \"Tunnel Street\". The tunnel is also used as a connector between western and eastern Washington Heights; passengers using the other entrance, at 191st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, need to take an elevator to access the station due to that intersection's height. The elevators at that entrance, which are outside fare control, are considered a convenient way to traverse the neighborhood without walking up a hill.\n\nIn the early 1990s the city's crime rates reached an all-time high. The station was considered very dangerous, with 11 crimes having taken place there in 1990; many of them were suspected to have happened in the tunnel. At the time, the tunnel was dimly lit, covered with graffiti, and strewn with garbage. Brighter lights were installed in 2000. In February 2006, State Senator Eric Schneiderman and others proposed the city turn the tunnel over to the MTA. They felt the MTA had more experience in maintaining tunnels, noting it owned the tunnels at the 181st Street and 190th Street stations on the IND Eighth Avenue Line, which were in better condition. In September 2014, improvements began on the tunnel, which area residents had complained about. The tunnel, which had graffiti and was frequented by cyclists riding bikes illegally, was slated to get several murals and some new LED lighting.\n\nThe passageway has been painted with murals since the late 2000s to beautify the tunnel. In 2008, a mural was painted on the passageway leading up from Broadway to the station, as part of the Groundswell Community Mural Project. It was called \"New York is a Rollercoaster\". It was later vandalized, and in May 2015, it was painted over. Since then, the passageway's artwork has consisted of five murals. As part of a tunnel beautification program, the NYCDOT chose four artists and one team of artists, mostly local, from an applicant pool of 158. They were chosen to paint a section of the tunnel. From the Broadway entrance to the station fare control, the artworks are: Queen Andrea's \"Prismatic Power Phrases\"; Jessie Unterhalter and Katey Truhn's \"Caterpillar Time Travel\"; Cekis's \"It's Like A Jungle/Aveces Es Como Una Jungle\"; Nick Kuszy's \"Warp Zone\"; and Cope2's \"Art is Life\". Awarded $15,000 each, the artists worked for over a week on their art.\n\nIn Fiscal Year 1914, shortly after the station's opening, it had 546,447 boardings, significantly lower than the figures for the adjacent 181st Street and Dyckman Street stations, which were 6,133,256 and 923,785, respectively. In 2018, the station had 2,526,932 boardings, making it the 186th most used station in the 424-station system. This amounted to an average of 8,032 passengers per weekday.\n\n"}

{"id": "1822878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822878", "title": "Stealing Beauty", "text": "Stealing Beauty\n\nStealing Beauty (; ) is a 1996 drama film directed by Bernardo Bertolucci and starring Liv Tyler, Joseph Fiennes, Jeremy Irons, Sinéad Cusack, and Rachel Weisz. Written by Bertolucci and Susan Minot, the film is about a nineteen-year-old American woman who travels to a lush Tuscan villa near Siena to stay with family friends of her poet mother, who recently died. The film was an international co-production between France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, and was Tyler's first leading film role.\n\n\"Stealing Beauty\" premiered in Italy in March 1996, and was officially selected for the 1996 Cannes Film Festival in France in May. It was released in the United States on June 14, 1996.\n\nThe film was made entirely in the Tuscany region of Italy. The main location for filming was the estate of Castello di Brolio, and a small villa on the property.\n\nLucy Harmon (Liv Tyler), a nineteen-year-old American, is the daughter of well-known (now deceased) poet and model, Sara Harmon. The film opens as Lucy arrives for a vacation at the Tuscan villa of Sara's old friends Ian and Diana Grayson (played by Donal McCann and Sinéad Cusack, respectively). Other guests include a prominent New York art gallery owner, an Italian advice columnist and an English writer, Alex Parrish (Jeremy Irons), who is dying of an unspecified disease. Lucy goes for a swim, and finds that Diana's daughter from a previous marriage, Miranda Fox (Rachel Weisz), is also there with her boyfriend, entertainment lawyer Richard Reed (D. W. Moffett). Miranda's brother, Christopher (Joseph Fiennes), is supposed to be there, but he is off on a road trip with the Italian son of a neighboring villa, Niccolò Donati (Roberto Zibetti). Lucy was particularly hoping to see Niccolò, whom she had met on a previous visit to the villa, four years earlier, and who was the first boy she'd ever kissed. Lucy and Niccolò had briefly exchanged letters after this first visit. One letter in particular Lucy had admired so much she memorized it.\n\nLucy reveals to the gallerist that she is there to have her portrait made by Ian, who is a sculptor. She says it's really just an excuse for her father to send her to Italy, \"as a present.\" Smoking marijuana with Parrish, Lucy reveals that she is a virgin. When Parrish shares this information with the rest of the villa the next day, Lucy is furious and decides to cut her visit short. While she is on the telephone booking a flight to New York, however, Christopher and Niccolò return from their road trip, and Lucy is once again happy, although she is disappointed that Niccolò did not immediately recognize her.\n\nThat evening, Niccolò comes to the Grayson villa for dinner, accompanied by his brother, Osvaldo (Ignazio Oliva). After dinner, the young people separate from the adults to smoke marijuana. Lucy is now able to laugh about Parrish's betrayal, and the group take turns recounting when they each lost their virginity. When the question comes around to Osvaldo, he demurs, saying, \"I don't know which is more ridiculous, this conversation or the silly political one going on over there [at the grown-ups' table].\" Lucy fawns over Niccolò but abruptly vomits in his lap.\n\nThe next day Lucy rides a bicycle to the Donati villa, looking for Niccolò. A servant informs her that he is in the garden, where Lucy finds him kissing another girl. Hastily bicycling away from the compound, she passes Osvaldo, who has been hunting with his dog. As she passes, Osvaldo holds up a jackrabbit he has killed and cries, \"Ciao, Lucy!\" Lucy doesn't stop but loses control of the bicycle at the next turn. Osvaldo tries to help but Lucy rebuffs his efforts and rides on.\n\nThe next day, Lucy poses outdoors for Ian's sketch studies, at one point exposing one of her breasts. Niccolò and Osvaldo arrive in a car. Niccolò ogles Lucy, but Osvaldo looks away, decrying Lucy's lack of propriety. Ian dismisses Lucy, who wanders off into an adjacent olive grove, followed by Niccolò. They begin to make out, but Lucy eventually pushes him away.\n\nRetreating to the guest house, Lucy shares her notebook with Parrish. Up to this point, the viewer has been led to believe that this notebook contains Lucy's writings. Now it is made clear that this is one of Sara Harmon's last notebooks. It contains an enigmatic poem that Lucy thinks holds clues to the identity of her real father. Throughout the film, she has been asking probing questions about her mother. Did Parrish ever know Sara to wear green sandals? Had Ian ever eaten olive leaves? Had Carlo Lisca (Carlo Cecchi) a war correspondent friend of the Graysons whom Sara had known ever killed a viper? All of these images are found in the poem, which Lucy now reads to Parrish. Lucy and Parrish agree that the poem must refer to Lucy's real father.\n\nThat evening, Lucy wears her mother's dress to the Donati's annual party. Almost immediately after arriving, Lucy sees Niccolò with another girl and the two do not speak. Lucy sees Osvaldo playing clarinet in the band that is providing musical entertainment. She later sees Osvaldo dancing with a girl, but they exchange earnest glances. Lucy picks up a young Englishman to take back to the Grayson's villa. On the way out, Osvaldo chases Lucy down and says that he's interested in visiting America and would like advice. They agree to meet the next day. Lucy leaves with the Englishman, who spends the night at the Grayson's villa but without having sex with Lucy.\n\nThe next day, Parrish's health takes a turn for the worse, and he is taken to the hospital. After the ambulance goes, Lucy skulks around Parrish's quarters in the guest house. Looking out one of his windows, she sees one of Ian's sculptures of a mother and child. The expression on her face suggests that she has had an epiphany. She goes to Ian's studio and asks him where he was in August 1975, when she was conceived. Ian says he was here, fixing up the villa. He says he thinks that might have been when Lucy's mother was at the villa, having her own portrait made. Lucy says, \"That's what I thought.\" Ian says they could ask Diana, but then he remembers that Diana was back in London at the time, finalizing her divorce. Without explicitly saying so, the two appear to acknowledge that Ian is Lucy's biological father, and Lucy promises to keep the secret.\n\nIn the meantime, Osvaldo has arrived at the villa. When Lucy exits Ian's studio, she is stung by a bee. Osvaldo rescues her and takes her to a brook, giving her wet clay for her stings. As they walk through the countryside, Osvaldo confesses that he wrote to Lucy once, pretending to be Niccolò.

Top Rank and ESPN later broke away from the partnership; Top Rank shifted its focus on targeting Spanish-language audiences in the U.S., while ESPN succeeded the broadcasts with a new series, \"Friday Night Fights\", which would feature bouts from other promoters. In 2009, ESPN and Top Rank began discussing a renewed deal; co-founder Bob Arum expressed dissatisfaction at the promotion's previous package for Versus, which featured a large number of low-quality bouts. Arum explained that he would be more likely to deal with ESPN for individual fights rather than a long-term contract, explaining that \"I ain't coming to them saying, 'Will you buy this fight or that fight.' We're past that. Give me a couple of dates and let us program them. You like them? Fine, give us a couple of more.\n\nOn June 17, 2017, \"The Ring\" reported that Top Rank was nearing a two-year deal to air a package of fights on ESPN, citing growing dissatisfaction with cuts to HBO's boxing coverage that limited scheduling options for fights. As a result, Top Rank declined to give HBO the rights to the then-upcoming Manny Pacquiao vs. Jeff Horn. The partnership was also said to include access to ESPN's archives for a planned Top Rank over-the-top service. On June 19, 2017, ESPN announced that it had acquired rights to broadcast Pacquiao vs. Horn, marking Pacquiao's first fight on a non-premium channel, and his first non-pay per view fight since 2005. After a negotiation window with HBO expired, ESPN officially announced that it would broadcast two more Top Rank cards in August, including Vasyl Lomachenko vs. Miguel Marriaga, and Terence Crawford vs. Julius Indongo.\n\nOn August 26, 2017, ESPN formally announced that it had reached a four-year deal to become the exclusive broadcaster of Top Rank bouts in the United States and Canada. The fights will be distributed through ESPN's television and digital platforms (including Spanish-language ESPN Deportes, replacing Top Rank's program for UniMás, and Canadian rights for ESPN's local partner TSN), the ESPN+ subscription streaming service, and pay-per-view. ESPN broadcast 18 cards in the first year of the deal. On August 2, 2018, ESPN announced an extension of the agreement through 2025.\n\nThe deal would also call for Top Rank to acquire U.S. rights to 24 international cards per-year for broadcast on ESPN+; in September 2018, ESPN and Top Rank acquired rights to cards in the United Kingdom from British promoter Frank Warren—a friend of Arum. In February 2019, Top Rank entered into a co-promotion agreement with Warren centered upon Tyson Fury, under which ESPN would hold the U.S. media rights to his bouts, and at least two per-year would occur in the United States. The deal was stated to have potential complications on prospects for a rematch against Deontay Wilder (whose last fight ended in a split draw), as Wilder is associated with Premier Boxing Champions (whose rightsholders include Fox Sports, and Showtime—who produced the PPV for Wilder and Fury's initial fight).\n\nIn April 2019, ESPN broadcast its first Top Rank PPV, featuring Terence Crawford against Amir Khan for the WBO Welterweight title.\n\nIn December 2019, it was announced that a Wilder/Fury re-match had been scheduled for February 2020, and that the PPV would be a joint production between ESPN and Fox Sports.\n\nIn 1998, ESPN premiered Friday Night Fights; the series traditionally featured bouts involving up-and-coming and semi-professional boxers, along with studio segments covering headlines and developments across the sport. As implied by its title, the program was primarily broadcast on Friday nights, semi-regularly.\n\nRingside commentary was provided by Joe Tessitore and Teddy Atlas; previous seasons featured boxing analyst Max Kellerman alongside Brian Kenny and sportscaster Bob Papa in Tessitore's role ringside with Atlas. The program spawned spinoffs, \"Tuesday Night Fights\" and \"Wednesday Night Fights\". A Spanish-language version, Noche de Combates, aired on ESPN Deportes and ESPN Latin America.\n\n\nBoxers who have fought on \"Tuesday Night Fights\":\n\nBoxers who have fought on \"Wednesday Night Fights\":\n\nOn March 19, 2015, ESPN announced that \"Friday Night Fights\" would air for the final time on May 22, 2015, covering the finals of the 2015 Boxcino tournament. The network announced that it had reached a multi-year deal with Al Haymon's \"Premier Boxing Champions\" to broadcast 11 events per-year on the main ESPN network, primarily on Saturday nights, and an afternoon event on ABC. Joe Tessitore and Teddy Atlas will carry over to serve as hosts. ESPN is one of several major broadcasters that airs fights through the promotion, which also includes NBC, CBS, their respective cable sports networks, as well as Spike.\n\nOn January 19, 2017, ESPN announced an agreement with Golden Boy Promotions to broadcast Golden Boy Boxing on ESPN. Under a two-year deal, ESPN and ESPN Deportes broadcast 42 Golden Boy-promoted cards, with 18 airing in 2017 and 24 airing in 2018. The contract included an option for a third year.\n"}

Students in grades 9 through 12 attend the school, which is part of the Tigard-Tualatin School District. Opened in 1992, school teams are known as the Timberwolves.\n\nTualatin High School's roots reach back to 1865, when a small red schoolhouse was built in the village. The schoolhouse went on to become Tualatin Elementary School and is now the location of the Tualatin Food Bank. It was replaced in 1900 with a new, two-room school on Boones Ferry Road, which is still a major thoroughfare in the city. A four-year high school program was offered for the first time in 1909, after the school was hoisted up and two more rooms were added beneath. However, the seven-member class of 1936 was the last class to graduate from the old Tualatin School. After that, students were sent to nearby high schools in Sherwood and Tigard. The move was further solidified in 1969, when Tualatin residents voted to officially join Tigard School District 23J.\n\nIn 1990, following rapid growth in Tualatin, the name of the district changed to the Tigard-Tualatin School District, a signal of Tualatin's emerging importance in the area's academic structure. Two years later, in 1992, the new Tualatin High School opened on a campus. Students from area junior high schools voted on the school colors and mascot.\n\nFor several years, the school lacked a swimming pool and auditorium, as well as proper spectator stands for its state-of-the-art football field. As a result, many extracurricular activities, such as plays and sporting events, took place on the grounds of the school's rival, Tigard High School. This was corrected in summer 1998, when the school completed its new sports stadium. Later that year, it opened its own auditorium and swim center. Since then, the softball and baseball facilities and a multi-purpose field has been converted to turf.\n\nThe new T.E.C.H. Wing (Tualatin Engineering, Computers, and Health) opened in spring 2006. In the 2018–2019 school year, construction was in place all around the school to add a new main office, an addition to the T.E.C.H. Wing, extensions to the commons, new classrooms, and a new locker room for the boys and girls.\n\nIn 2008, 85% of the school's seniors received a high school diploma.

{"id": "1822919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822919", "title": "Composition (visual arts)", "text": "Composition (visual arts)\n\nIn the visual arts, composition is the placement or arrangement of the visual elements, such as figures, trees, and so on in a work of art, as distinct from the subject or the style with which it is depicted. It can also be thought of as the organization of the elements of art according to the principles of art.\n\nThe composition of a picture is different from its subject, what is depicted, whether a moment from a story, a person or a place. Many subjects, for example Saint George and the Dragon, are often portrayed in art, but using a great range of compositions even though the two figures are typically the only ones shown. \n\nThe term composition means 'putting together' and can apply to any work of art, from music to writing to photography, that is arranged using conscious thought. In the visual arts, composition is often used interchangeably with various terms such as \"design, form, visual ordering,\" or \"formal structure,\" depending on the context. In graphic design for press and desktop publishing, composition is commonly referred to as page layout.\n\nThe central visual element, known as \"element of design\", \"formal element\", or \"element of art,\" constitute the vocabulary with which the visual artist compose. These elements in the overall design usually relate to each other and to the whole art work.\n\nThe elements of design are:\n\nLines are optical phenomena that allow the artist to direct the eye of the viewer. The optical illusion of lines do exist in nature and visual arts elements can be arranged to create this illusion. The viewer unconsciously reads near continuous arrangement of different elements and subjects at varying distances. Such elements can be of dramatic use in the composition of the image. These could be literal lines such as telephone and power cables or rigging on boats. Lines can derive also from the borders of areas of differing color or contrast, or sequences of discrete elements. Movement is also a source of lines, where the blurred movement renders as a line.\n\nSubject lines contribute to both mood and linear perspective, giving the viewer the illusion of depth. Oblique lines convey a sense of movement and angular lines generally convey a sense of dynamism and possibly tension. Lines can also direct attention towards the main subject of picture, or contribute to organization by dividing it into compartments. The artist may exaggerate or create lines perhaps as part of their message to the viewer. Many lines without a clear subject point suggest chaos in the image and may conflict with the mood the artist is trying to evoke.\n\nStraight left lines create different moods and add affection to visual arts. A line's angle and its relationship to the size of the frame influence the mood of the image. Horizontal lines, commonly found in landscape photography, can give the impression of calm, tranquility, and space. An image filled with strong vertical lines tends to have the impression of height and grandeur. Tightly angled convergent lines give a dynamic, lively, and active effect to the image. Strongly angled, almost diagonal lines produce tension in the image. The viewpoint of visual art is very important because every different perspective views different angled lines. This change of perspective elicits a different response to the image. By changing the perspective only by some degrees or some centimetres lines in images can change tremendously and a totally different feeling can be transported. Straight lines are also strongly influenced by tone, color, and repetition in relation to the rest of the image.\n\nCompared to straight lines, curves provide a greater dynamic influence in a picture. They are also generally more aesthetically pleasing, as the viewer associates them with softness. In photography, curved lines can give graduated shadows when paired with soft-directional lighting, which usually results in a very harmonious line structure within the image. There are two main types of curves, a simple \"C\" curve as well as well as a more sinuous \"S\" curve.\n\nThere are three properties of color. Hue, brightness or chroma, and value. Hue is simply the name of a color, (red, yellow, and blue, etc.) Brightness and chroma refer to the intensity and strength of the color. A high chroma color is more pure and less greyed than a low chroma color. The lightness and darkness to a color is the value. Color also has the ability to work within our emotions. Given that, we can use color to create mood. It can also be used as tone, pattern, light, movement, symbol, form, harmony, and contrast. \n\nTexture refers to how an object feels or how it looks like it may feel if it were touched. There are two ways we experience texture, physically and optically. Different techniques can be used to create physical texture, which allows qualities of visual art to be seen and felt. This can include surfaces such as metal, sand, and wood. Optical texture is when the illusion of physical texture is created. Photography, paintings, and drawings use visual texture to create a more realistic appearance. \n\nLightness and darkness are known as value in visual art. Value deals with how light reflects off objects and how we see it. The more light that is reflected, the higher the value. White is the highest or lightest value while black is the lowest or darkest value. Colors also have value, for example, yellow has a high value while blue and red have a low value. If you take a black and white picture of a colorful scene, all you are left with are the values. This important element of design, especially in painting and drawing, allows the artist to create the illusion of light through value contrast. \n\nThe term form can mean different things in visual art. Form suggests a three-dimensional object in space. It is also described as the physical nature of the artwork, such as sculptures. It can also be looked at as art form, which can be expressed through fine art. A form encloses volume, has length, width, and height, unlike a shape, which is only two-dimensional. Forms that are mathematical, a sphere, pyramid, cube, cylinder, and cone, are known as geometric forms. Organic forms are typically irregular and asymmetrical. This form can be found in nature, such as flowers, rocks, trees, etc., but can also be seen in architecture. \n\nForms in drawing and painting convey the illusion of three-dimensional form through lighting, shadows, value, and tone. The more contrast in value, the more pronounced the three-dimensional form is. Forms with little value appear flatter than those with greater variation and contrast.\n\nSpace is the area around, above, and within an object. Photographers can capture space, architects build space, and painters create space. This element is found in each of the visual arts. It can be positive or negative, open or closed, shallow or deep, and two-dimensional or three-dimensional. In drawing or painting, space is not actually there, but the illusion of it is. Positive space is the subject of the piece. The empty spaces around, above, and within, is negative space. \n\nThe artist determines what the center of interest (focus in photography) of the art work will be, and composes the elements accordingly. The gaze of the viewer will then tend to linger over these points of interest, elements are arranged with consideration of several factors (known variously as the \"principles of organization, principles of art,\" or \"principles of design\") into a harmonious whole which works together to produce the desired statement – a phenomenon commonly referred to as unity. Such factors in composition should not be confused with the elements of art (or elements of design) themselves. For example, shape is an \"element\"; the usage of shape is characterized by various \"principles.\"\n\nSome principles of organization affecting the composition of a picture are:\n\nThe position of the viewer can strongly influence the aesthetics of an image, even if the subject is entirely imaginary and viewed \"within the mind's eye\". Not only does it influence the elements within the picture, but it also influences the viewer's interpretation of the subject.\n\nFor example, if a boy is photographed from above, perhaps from the eye level of an adult, he is diminished in stature. A photograph taken at the child's level would treat him as an equal, and one taken from below could result in an impression of dominance. Therefore, the photographer is choosing the viewer's positioning.\n\nA subject can be rendered more dramatic when it fills the frame. There exists a tendency to perceive things as larger than they actually are, and filling the frame fulfills this psychological mechanism. This can be used to eliminate distractions from the background.\n\nIn photography, altering the position of the camera can change the image so that the subject has fewer or more distractions with which to compete. This may be achieved by getting closer, moving laterally, tilting, panning, or moving the camera vertically.\n\nThere are numerous approaches or \"compositional techniques\" to achieve a sense of unity within an artwork, depending on the goals of the artist. For example, a work of art is said to be aesthetically pleasing to the eye if the elements within the work are arranged in a balanced compositional way. However, there are artists such as Salvador Dalí who aim to disrupt traditional composition and challenge the viewer to rethink balance and design elements within art works.\n\nConventional composition can be achieved with a number of techniques:\n\nThe rule of thirds is a composition guide that states that arranging the important features of an image on or near the horizontal and vertical lines that would divide the image into thirds horizontally and vertically is visually pleasing. The objective is to stop the subject(s) and areas of interest (such as the horizon) from bisecting the image, by placing them near one of the lines that would divide the image into three equal columns and rows, ideally near the intersection of those lines.\n\nThe rule of thirds is thought to be a simplification of the golden ratio. The golden ratio is thought to have been used by artists throughout history as a composition guide, but there is little evidence to support this claim.\n\nThe \"rule of odds\" suggests that an odd number of subjects in an image is more interesting than an even number. Thus if you have more than one subject in your picture, the suggestion is to choose an arrangement with at least three subjects. An even number of subjects produces symmetries in the image, which can appear less natural for a naturalistic, informal composition.\n\nAn image of a person surrounded/framed by two other persons, for instance, where the person in the center is the object of interest in that image/artwork, is more likely to be perceived as friendly and comforting by the viewer, than an image of a single person with no significant surroundings.\n\nThe rule of space applies to artwork (photography, advertising, illustration) picturing object(s) to which the artist wants to apply the illusion of movement, or which is supposed to create a contextual bubble in the viewer's mind.\n\nThis can be achieved, for instance, by leaving white space in the direction the eyes of a portrayed person are looking, or, when picturing a runner, adding white space in front of him rather than behind him to indicate movement.\n\nImages with clutter can distract from the main elements within the picture and make it difficult to identify the subject. By decreasing the extraneous content, the viewer is more likely to focus on the primary objects. Clutter can also be reduced through the use of lighting, as the brighter areas of the image tend to draw the eye, as do lines, squares and colour. In painting, the artist may use less detailed and defined brushwork towards the edges of the picture.Removing the elements to the focus of the object, taking only the needed components.\n\nIn photography, and also (via software simulation of real lens limitations) in 3D graphics, one approach to achieving simplification is to use a wide aperture when shooting to limit the depth of field. When used properly in the right setting, this technique can place everything that is not the subject of the photograph out of focus.\n\nA similar approach, given the right equipment, is to take advantage of the Scheimpflug principle to change the plane of focus.\n\nRelated to the rule of odds is the observation that triangles are an aesthetically pleasing implied shape within an image. In a canonically attractive face, the mouth and eyes fall within the corners of the area of an equilateral triangle. Paul Cézanne successfully used triangles in his compositions of still lifes. A triangular format creates a sense of stability and strength.\n\nIt is generally thought to be more pleasing to the viewer if the image encourages the eye to move around the image, rather than immediately fixating on a single place or no place in particular. Artists will often strive to avoid creating compositions that feel \"static\" or \"flat\" by incorporating movement into the image. In image A the 2 mountains are equally sized and positioned beside each other creating a very static and uninteresting image. In image B the mountains are differently sized and one is placed closer to the horizon, guiding the eye to move from one mountain to the other creating a more interesting and pleasing image. This also feels more natural because in nature objects are rarely the same size and evenly spaced. \n\nThese principles \"can\" be means of a good composition yet they \"cannot\" be applied separately but should act together to form a good composition.\n\nThese paintings all show the same subject, the Raising of Lazarus, and essentially the same figures, but have very different compositions:\n\n\n\n"}

It was released on December 1, 1997, by Columbia Records as the second single from her sixth studio album \"Butterfly\" (1997). The song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. \"Butterfly\" is a pop and R&B-ballad combining elements of gospel. Carey had originally conceived it as a house record with David Morales titled \"Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)\". After realizing how personal the lyrics were and how they could be applied to \"Butterfly\", she wrote the album's title track with Afanasieff. On the song's lyrics, Carey sings to someone, telling them to spread their wings and release into the world on their own, like a butterfly.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Butterfly\" depicts Carey in an abandoned house, trapped in a desolate life. As the video progresses, she leaves, apparently for the first time in years, and runs into a nearby meadow. Towards the end, Carey jumps over a barbed fence and goes out into the world on a horse. The song's lyrics and video were directly connected to Carey's personal life at the time. \"Butterfly\" was performed live on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", \"Saturday Night Live\", and various European television programs. The song was also a permanent part of the set-list during her Butterfly World Tour during 1998. Due to current conflict with Columbia, \"Butterfly\" was never issued a commercial release, therefore hindering its charting ability. The single performed weakly on the charts, peaking outside the top 20 in most countries, except for New Zealand, where it peaked at number 15. The song also reached the top 10 in Taiwan. In 2003, \"Q Magazine\" ranked \"Butterfly\" at number 563 in their list of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\".\n\nDuring the recording for \"Butterfly\", Carey was in the midst of her separation from then husband, Tommy Mottola. While writing the material for the album, she wrote a house music record titled \"Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)\" with David Morales. When the song was finished, Carey felt there was something more she could do with the song; the lyrics were very personal and a perfect fit for a ballad. After contemplating on the matter, Carey re-wrote \"Fly Away\" in ballad form, and incorporated new lyrics and vocals.\n\nIt was '97 and I was leaving my marriage [to Tommy Mottola]. which encompassed my life. I was writing the song 'Butterfly' wishing that that's what he would say to me. There's a part that goes, 'I have learned that beauty / has to flourish in the light / wild horses run unbridled / or their spirit dies / you have given me the courage / to be all that I can / and I truly feel ...[sings] and I truly feel your heart will lead you back to me when you're ready to land.' At that point I really believed that I was going to go back to the marriage – I didn't think I was going to leave forever. But then the things that happened to me during that time caused me to not go back. Had it been, 'Go be yourself, you've been with me since you were a kid, let's separate for a while,' I probably would've.\n\nThe song was named \"Butterfly\" and became Carey's \"favorite and most heartfelt ballad.\" Its lyrics were very personal, linking to Carey's personal life and relationship with Mottola. Carey wrote \"Butterfly\" for Mottola, hoping he would say its contents to her, and choose to do what was best for her. She described the song as \"the best ballad she had ever written\" and credited it as the epitome of her magnum opus, which was \"Butterfly\".\n\n\"Butterfly\" is a personal ballad, which blends pop, R&B, gospel and soul genres. It incorporates piano and drum notes, including heavy beats and grooves. As part of \"layering the song,\" background vocals are featured throughout the chorus and sections of the bridge. It is set in the signature common time, and is written in the key of A major. It features a basic chord progression of A-F-. Carey's vocal range in the song spans from the note of G to the high note of A; the piano and guitar pieces range from A to A. The song contains choral lyrics written by Carey, who produced the song's melody and chorus as well. Aside from assisting with its writing and chord progression, Afanasieff co-arranged and produced the track as well. In his review for the album, David Browne commented on the song's lyrics and message \"The title song, a slice of florid pop gospel, explores the old if-you-love-someone-set-her-free theme; It isn't a reach to interpret these songs as describing life with the reportedly controlling Mottola.\n\nPaul Verna from \"Billboard\" gave the song a positive review, writing \"the lovely 'Butterfly' is classic Carey, from its gospel-kissed ballad instrumentation and choir chants to the diva's soaring, glass-shattering performance.\" Verna concluded his review of the song \"This should not imply, however, that she is covering crusty old ground. The notable maturity in her lyrics and worldly warmth of her vocal reflect the growth that she has continually strived to attain.\" Rick Juzwiak from \"Slant\" gave the song a mixed review, but felt it was a pivotal part of Carey's vocal and musical transition. Juzwiak wrote \"The agonizingly slow 'Butterfly,' with its predictably soaring chorus and if-it-comes-back-it-was-meant-to-be message, would have been ignorable tripe. Here, it's a show for the peeping. Echoes of her newly failed relationship with Mottola bounce off the gospelly song's cheap stained glass and then garble so that it sounds like some insane document of Stockholm Syndrome.\" He felt however, that the song was an important part of the album, \"It isn't just subject matter that elevates 'Butterfly' above Carey's usual melodrama. Carey's vocal delivery and her willingness to experiment with it helped define the album, so it's only appropriate that its title track is the first of many to showcase Carey's much-debated 'whisper voice.'\"\n\n\"Butterfly\" was a moderate success on the charts, performing weakly in many music markets. In the United States, the song charted on the Hot 100 Airplay, peaking at number sixteen. In Canada, the song entered the \"RPM\" Singles Chart at number 57 on the \"RPM\" issue dated November 3, 1997, and reached its peak of number 22 on December 1, 1997. It was present on the chart for a total of 14 weeks.\n\nThe song's success in Europe was very limited as well, due to its non-commercial release. In the United Kingdom, the song entered the singles chart at its peak of 22, the week of December 13, 1997. \"Butterfly\" stayed in the chart for six weeks, falling out of the chart the week of January 17, 1998. In France and The Netherlands, the song peaked at number 43 and 52, respectively. In Australia, \"Butterfly\" cracked the top-40, peaking at number 27 and spending a total of ten weeks on the chart. \"Butterfly\" charted at number 15 in New Zealand, spending seven weeks on the chart. \"Butterfly\" was nominated for the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, which it lost to Sarah McLachlan's \"Building a Mystery.\"\n\nThe single's music video was co-directed by Carey and Daniel Pearl. It was inspired by the Tennessee Williams play \"Baby Doll\" and a dream Carey had one night. The video begins with scenes of a man leaving his home one early morning; only his feet are shown. Carey is first seen residing in the derelict house, in the middle of a large meadow. She awakes, sad and depressed, wearing battered and disheveled clothing. As she walks down the stairs, Carey sits on the staircase, lamenting in agony at her loneliness. As the video climaxes, Carey is seen finally leaving the foyer, apparently for the first time in many years, escaping from the misery she once called home. As she reaches the outskirts of the property, Carey mounts a horse, which assists her in jumping over the barbed fence. After leaving, Carey is seen smiling for the first time in the video, while waiving her arms in the air.\n\nThe video drew many comparisons to the rumors of Carey's deteriorating marriage at the time. Author Chris Nickson felt the video, like the song, served as a metaphor for the things that were taking place in her life at the time. Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling, abusive and would even monitor Carey's phone calls. For this reason, she is portrayed with tattered clothing and hair in the video, with the final moments showing her escape. It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of, and finally breaking free into the outside world. Unlike the video, the lyrics spoke of setting your loved one free, because it is the best thing for them; showing that their love for the person should be greater than their own happiness.\n\nCarey performed \"Butterfly\" on various American and European television programs. In the US, Carey first performed the song live on the Late Show with David Letterman, prior to an interview. Carey wore a mid-length black gown for the performance, and was accompanied by three back-up singers, Walter Afanasieff on piano and Randy Jackson playing the bass. On September 12, Carey sang \"Butterfly\" live on The Oprah Winfrey Show alongside her previous hit, \"Hero.\" For her appearance, Carey wore a short blue skirt, and featured an array of gospel back-up singers. On November 15, Carey performed the song live on Saturday Night Live, alongside \"My All.\" The performance featured the same musicians on set, with the exception of Afanasieff, who was absent. In Europe, Carey performed the song on the popular German game show, Wetten, dass..?, featured only three female back-up singers. In France, Carey visited the talk show, \"The Hit Machine,\" where she performed the song as well. After completing the song, Carey received a standing ovation.\n\nThe song was sung during her Butterfly World Tour in 1998, a part of the set list of every show. For the performances in Japan, Carey donned a long flowing gown, and featured live back-up. During the performance, large images of butterflies were projected onto the large screen behind her. The performances served as one of the closing songs on the set-list. Similar props and set-up were used for the following shows of the tour, with the addition on the \"Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)\" addition at the show's finale. In subsequent tours, the chorus of the song was played by the band and sung by the background vocals at the end of each concert as Carey would exit the stage. In the Angels Advocate Tour an instrumental version was played as an introduction while Carey entered the stage. \"Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)\" was put as the introduction of Carey's shows during her second concert residency placed in Las Vegas, The Butterfly Returns (2018) to match its theme.\n\n\nCredits adapted from the \"Butterfly\" liner notes.\n\n"}

He managed the Cincinnati Reds, Milwaukee Brewers, Atlanta Braves, and San Francisco Giants during this period.\n\nBristol attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Western Carolina University. A right-handed hitting and throwing infielder, he never played in the Major Leagues. Bristol became a playing manager in the Cincinnati farm system at the age of 24 with the Hornell Redlegs of the Class D New York–Penn League in 1957. By 1964, he was managing the Reds' top farm team, the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, where, at age 31, he won a pennant and playoff title—the fifth league championship of his eight-year career to date. In nine seasons (1957–65) as a minor league pilot, his teams won 652 games and lost 562 (.537).\n\nIn 1966, Bristol was named to the Reds' coaching staff, and when the team performed badly under rookie skipper Don Heffner, Bristol took over the club as manager on July 13. At 33, he was the youngest pilot in the Major Leagues that season through 1969. Bristol guided the Reds through 3 winning seasons, but he was dismissed following the campaign. Sparky Anderson, who took over from Bristol, would go into the Baseball Hall of Fame as the leader of the \"Big Red Machine\".\n\nCincinnati (298–265, .529) represented the highwater mark of Bristol's managing career. He would never manage another winning club.\n\nNot long after being fired by the Reds, Bristol was hired by the Seattle Pilots as the second manager in their history. He walked into a very difficult situation; the Pilots were on the verge of bankruptcy, and went to spring training not knowing whether they would play in Seattle or Milwaukee in . Just six days before Opening Day, the Pilots got word they would be moving to Milwaukee as the Brewers. The Brewers under Bristol were never able to put together a winning team; he was fired 30 games into the 1972 season.\n\nIn 1976, Bristol was hired as manager of the Atlanta Braves. Midway through the season, with the Braves mired in a 16-game losing streak, owner Ted Turner sent Bristol on a 10-day \"scouting trip\" and took over as his own manager. This only lasted for one game (a 2–1 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates) before National League president Chub Feeney ordered Turner to give up the reins, citing major league rules which forbid managers or players from owning stock in a team. After the Braves broke the streak with third-base coach Vern Benson as interim manager, Bristol—who had returned to his offseason home in Andrews, North Carolina—was brought back to finish out what was at the time the worst season in the Atlanta portion of Braves history (61–101—including a 60–100 record by Bristol). He was fired at the end of the season. He last managed in MLB with the Giants late in the season and all of before he was replaced by Frank Robinson, prior to the 1981 season. He finished with a career managerial record of 657 win and 764 defeats (.462).\n\nIn addition to his rookie MLB season with Cincinnati, Bristol also served as the third-base coach of the Montreal Expos (1973–75) and Giants (1978–79), plus two terms with the Philadelphia Phillies (1982–85; 1988), and two additional stints with the Reds (1989; 1993).\n\nIn 2018, he was named to the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.\n\n, or Baseball-Reference (Managers)\n"}

After a short-lived attempt to make a living through boxing, he decided to become a professional wrestler.\n\nSkaaland debuted in 1946 as \"Arnold Skaaland\". Though competing under his real name, he was billed early in his career as hailing from Norway. Performing throughout the northeastern United States, Skaaland gained the nickname \"The Golden Boy\" and was known as a small, agile wrestler who relied on speed, wits, and toughness in the ring rather than size and strength. In the late 1950s, he wrestled in Georgia under the ring name Bobby Weaver.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Skaaland unsuccessfully challenged both Pat O'Connor and \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. In 1962, he refereed a high-profile match between Freddie Blassie and Rikidōzan in Japan.\n\nIn 1963, Skaaland was a part of the newly created, New York City-based World Wide Wrestling Federation. On June 1, 1967 he collected his only title as one half of the WWWF United States Tag Team Champions, when Tony Parisi gave his half of the title to Skaaland. Skaaland and his partner, Spiros Arion, soon lost the titles to The Sicilians (Lou Albano and Tony Altimore) on July 10, 1967 in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Arion and Bruno Sammartino rewon the belts two weeks later, and retired them.\n\nIn addition to wrestling, Skaaland was a shareholder of the Capitol Wrestling Corporation, the parent company of the WWWF, and a business partner of WWWF Chairman Vince McMahon Sr. Skaaland was responsible for producing WWWF shows in the Westchester County Center in Westchester County, New York and serving as an agent for André the Giant.\n\nSkaaland managed Bruno Sammartino and Bob Backlund, with both men winning the WWF World Heavyweight Championship under his tutelage.\n\nIn 1978, Skaaland retired from regular wrestling, though he occasionally appeared as a late substitute for wrestlers that couldn't make a show. Pro Wrestling Illustrated named Skaaland Manager of the Year for 1978 and 1979. Backlund's lengthy reign ended on December 26, 1983 when Skaaland threw in the towel while Backlund was trapped in the camel clutch, the finishing move of challenger The Iron Sheik.\n\nSkaaland appeared in the 1987 music video for the title track from \"Piledriver - The Wrestling Album 2\", \"Piledriver\" by Koko B. Ware as the foreman of a construction site. In 1994, he was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1994 for managing both Sammartino and Backlund to the (W)WWF World Heavyweight Championship. He appeared on WWF television later that year, with Backlund attacking him in order to consolidate his heel turn.\n\nSkaaland was married to Betty Skaaland, with whom he had three sons: Edward Patrick Skaaland, James Allen Skaaland, and George Skaaland (the latter of whom briefly competed as a wrestler in his own right in the mid-1980s).\n\nSkaaland died on March 13, 2007, with his wife Betty Skaaland by his side. He is interred at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York.\n\n\n"}

It was hosted by Gene Rayburn and announced by Don Pardo and produced by Goodson-Todman Productions.\n\nThe show had two teams of children compete for points with the winning team earning a prize. Each side was represented by four children, usually three boys and one girl. The boys competed against each other and the girls competed against each other.\n\nThe teams were named \"Space Pilots\" and \"Bronco Busters\". Each team had an adult assistant who dressed as a space commander or cowboy, respectively. The assistants introduced each contestant to Rayburn. Each player selected chose a postcard from a pool which had been sent in by children from all over the country. The team that won also won a prize for the child whose postcard they had drawn.\n\nThe children competed against each other doing stunts. The stunts were the type one might have seen on \"Beat the Clock\" (another Goodson-Todman Production). The winning team for each stunt scored 100 points. The losing team was allowed to do something else to earn 25 or 50 points. Their consolation stunt was dictated to them by a character called \"Mr. Mischief\", a wall-puppet that was operated and voiced by Pardo. The time limit for the stunt was a whistle which could go off at any time. This was later changed to a balloon in Mr. Mischief's mouth which would inflate until it burst. When it was time for the losing team's child to go meet Mr. Mischief, Gene accompanied the child while doing a \"silly walk\" - perhaps a precursor to the Monty Python Silly Walk episode.\n\nAt some point in the show was a contest called the Super Duper Doo stunt. Each week a child was chosen to compete in an additional stunt for the possibility of winning a grand prize at the end of a four-week period by getting the most items. The first stunt involved tossing 15 playing cards at a ball covered with sticky tape that was suspended from the ceiling, while standing in a box (the prize promised was a boat-rig). The second stunt involved blowing 10 sheets of paper off a podium, trying to get them to land in a wastebasket that was set in front of them (the prize promised was a television set). It is unknown what the third stunt involved.\n\nIf there was extra time at the end of the show, there would be team stunts to allow a team to catch up on points.\n\nThe four children on the winning team won grand prizes of bicycles for the studio contestants and cameras for the home partners. The other team received a sportsmanship award of ice skates for both the studio contestants and home partners.\n\nOn April 23, 2005 and November 27, 2007 GSN aired an episode of an earlier version produced for CBS with Bob Kennedy hosting. The teams were called the \"Space Rangers\" and the \"Cowboys\", with each team having a large bleacher of children on its side.\n\nA child from each team competed in stunts, and then gained points on a ring-toss board with each peg marked with a number of points. The child who won the stunt would throw two rings for their team and the child who lost would throw one. The show had three \"magic numbers\" each show, which if the team's point total match would win them 10 extra points, and a special prize for the child who tossed the ring. The process repeated with different children from each team until the show ran out of time.\n\nAll children on both teams received a \"sportsmanship prize\", such as a camera, and the members of the winning team, along with several home viewers chosen from a pool of write-ins, won a grand prize, such as a watch.\n\nThe stunts used throughout the run were devised by Bob Howard and Frank Wayne; the same two men also did the stunts for \"Beat the Clock\", which was still on the air at the time.\n\nThe series may or may not be destroyed; this is uncertain because, although Goodson-Todman usually kept their shows, NBC would usually destroy anything they didn't think was worth keeping - children's shows were no exception unless companies (such as Hanna-Barbera) dictated otherwise.\n\nGSN has aired one CBS episode and the first five NBC episodes in the past. On September 11, 2017 Buzzr aired the first NBC episode.\n\n"}

It stars Dexter Fletcher and Ione Skye with Jonathan Pryce, James Spader, Bill Paterson, Jared Harris, Claire Skinner, Lesley Sharp and Michael Gambon in supporting roles.\n\nCharles (Fletcher) is a confident and intelligent nineteen-year-old, about to attend Oxford University. Charles is a computer nerd and has developed a methodical approach to seduction, and compiles detailed computer files and elaborate plans to seduce the girls he is interested in. His latest target is a beautiful American girl, Rachel (Skye). Charles becomes infatuated with Rachel, and after numerous rebuffs he eventually forms a friendship with her. Rachel already has a boyfriend, control freak DeForest (Spader) who treats her badly. With help from his sister Jenny (Sharp), his eccentric brother-in-law Norman (Pryce), and friend and mentor Geoff (Harris), Charles lures Rachel away from DeForest. His father Gordon (Paterson) is impressed with Charles' new girlfriend. As the unlikely relationship develops, Charles discovers his seemingly \"perfect\" woman has bad habits and personality flaws, just like all the \"lesser\" girls he has previously seduced. Charles becomes bored and is seduced by his old flame Gloria (Skinner), ending his relationship with Rachel, who moves to New York. Charles goes to Oxford University but misses Rachel. They meet by chance in a museum and spend the day together, but when parting Rachel only kisses him on the cheek. Charles says in voiceover that he tried, but failed, to remember William Blake's quotation about love being eternal, so that he could say it to Rachel.\n\nInternationally the film was not a significant commercial success, and in the US was ranked 206 in 1989.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 40% based on reviews from 10 critics. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 56% based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nHal Hinson of the Washington Post praises the performance of Jonathan Pryce, and calls Fletcher \"a genuine star\". Hinson views the use of monologue positively, saying that directly addressing the audience \"draw[s] us into an atmosphere of puckish intimacy, and immediately we become accomplices in his plots -- happy accomplices.\" Praising Fletcher he concludes \"His devilish precocity makes \"The Rachel Papers\" a bracing treat.\"\nBarry McIlheney of Empire Magazine give the film 2/5 and writes \"Captures the brash boldness of the novel, but not the literary wit. A misguided affair.\"\n\n\"Variety\" says the book brought a fresh direction to old ideas but is critical of the film as \"Director Damian Harris isn't able to capture the book's special charms, and resorts to having his young hero address the camera to keep the viewer in the picture.\" Variety is critical of Fletcher's performance, calling him too self-conscious and a \"a less than endearing hero\", but praises Skye for her sensual performance.\nTime Out London is critical of the film, writing \"the humour is as smug, adolescent and misogynist as it was in the novel\". The reviewer says the performance of the lead actors are insubstantial, but also overshadowed by Pryce's crowd-pleasing cameo, putting the blame on the director and script for the barely developed characters and the lack of detail: \"The result is without dramatic or moral weight, despite Highway's contrived comeuppance, and it's impossible to care about the characters.\"\n\n"}

Refusal to work overtime, travel on duty, or sign up to other tasks requiring employee assent are other manifestations of using work-to-rule as industrial action.\n\nSir John Donaldson described it as a decision to \"[g]ive the rules a meaning which no reasonable man could give them and work to that.\"\n\nSometimes the term \"rule-book slowdown\" is used in a slightly different sense than \"work-to-rule\": the former involves applying to-the-letter rules that are normally set aside or interpreted less literally to increase efficiency; the latter, refraining from activities which are customary but not required by rule or job description, but the terms may be used synonymously.\n\nWork-to-rules can be misconstrued as malicious even when it is only a removal of good-will, such as employees insisting on taking all legally entitled breaks, or refusing a request to work unpaid overtime.\n\nSometimes work-to-rule can be considered by employers as malicious compliance as they pursue legal action against workers. While not legally enforceable under minimum statutory law, employers may enforce customized employment contract terms that the employee agreed to:\n\nThey may also take standard forms of action especially where custom terms were not negotiated during the offer:\n"}

{"id": "1822951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822951", "title": "Girdling", "text": "Girdling\n\nGirdling, also called ring-barking is the complete removal of a strip of bark (consisting of cork cambium or \"phellogen\", phloem, cambium and sometimes going into the xylem) from around the entire circumference of either a branch or trunk of a woody plant. Girdling results in the death of the area above the girdle over time. A branch completely girdled will fail and when the main trunk of a tree is girdled, the entire tree will die, if it cannot regrow from above to bridge the wound. Human practices of girdling including forestry, horticulture, and vandalism. Foresters use the practice of girdling to thin forests. Animals such as rodents will girdle trees by feeding on outer bark, often during winter under snow. Girdling can also be caused by herbivorous mammals feeding on plant bark and by birds and insects, both of which can effectively girdle a tree by boring rows of adjacent holes.\n\nOrchardists use girdling as a cultural technique to yield larger fruit or set fruit, often called cincturing used in agriculture.\n\nLike all vascular plants, trees use two vascular tissues for transportation of water and nutrients: the xylem (also known as the wood) and the phloem (the innermost layer of the bark). Girdling results in the removal of the phloem, and death occurs from the inability of the leaves to transport sugars (primarily sucrose) to the roots. In this process, the xylem is left untouched, and the tree can usually still temporarily transport water and minerals from the roots to the leaves. Trees normally sprout shoots below the wound; if not, the roots die. Death occurs when the roots can no longer produce ATP and transport nutrients upwards through the xylem. (The formation of new shoots below the wound can be prevented by painting the wound with herbicide.)\n\nRing barking techniques have been developed to disrupt or impede sugar transport in phloem, stimulating early flower production and increasing fruiting, and for controlling plant size, reducing the need for pruning.\nGirdling is a slow process compared to felling and is often used only when necessary, such as in the removal of an individual tree from an ecologically protected area without damaging surrounding growth.\n\nAccidental girdling is also possible and some activities must be performed with care. Saplings which are tied to a supporting stake may unintentionally be girdled as they grow, due to friction caused by contact with the tie. If ropes are tied frequently to a tree (e.g. to tether an animal or moor a boat), the friction of the rope can also lead to the removal of bark.\n\nThe practice of girdling has been known in Europe for some time. Another example is the girdling of selective Douglas-fir trees in some Northern California oak woodlands, such as Annadel State Park, in order to prevent that fir from massive invasion of the mixed oak woodland.\n\nGirdling can be used to create standing dead wood, or snags. This can provide a valuable habitat for a variety of wildlife, including insects and nesting birds.\n\nGirdling is also used as a technique to force a fruit-bearing plant to bear larger fruit. A farmer would place a girdle (bark removal) at base of a large branch or at the trunk. Thus, all sugars manufactured by the leaves have no sinks but the fruit, which grows to above the normal size. For grapes girdling or cincturing is used to make the grapes large and sweeter on the grape canopy and are sold as girdled grapes. Flowering and fruit setting is a problem on some trees; girdling may improve yield in the same way. The \"damage\" done by girdling restricts the movement of nutrients to the roots, thus the carbohydrates produced in the leaves do not go to the roots for storage. Girdling temporarily stops tree growth. Root pruning, an ancient Asian practice, and other controlled damaging, such as driving nails into the trunk or beating the branches and trunk, produce results that are similar to girdling. Girdling is commonly used on grape, avocado, apple, litchi, mango, citrus and other trees. Girdling is normally only done to healthy trees that did not yield well the previous year. Care must be used not to damage sapwood that may kill the tree or vine. Trees normally heal in four to five weeks after cincturing. Painting the cut can protect against fungus and pests.\n\nBoth herbivores and birds can effectively girdle trees in the process of normal feeding.\n\nIn North America, voles in particular are prone to damaging trees by girdling both their roots and trunk. Among North American birds, the sapsuckers are the most common girdlers of trees. While sapsuckers will bore holes in tree trunks to feed upon insects, they also make parallel rings of holes in order to eat sap that collects in the openings or to feed it to their young. They most frequently attack pine, birch, maple, spruce and fruit trees and do the most damage during breeding season and territory establishment between February and June.\n\nThe feeding activity of beavers is a major source of girdled trees near water sources.\n\nMany kinds of deer inadvertently girdle trees by rubbing their antlers on saplings and mature trees.\n\nOne of several ways rabbits damage the environment in Australia is by girdling.\n\nTrees can be girdled by climbing, twining, and ground-creeping (rampant) vines. There are several invasive species that harm trees in this way and cause significant damage to forest canopy and the health of ecosystems dependent on it. Oriental Bittersweet, Oriental Wisteria, and English Ivy all can damage and kill trees by girdling.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1822952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822952", "title": "Daewoo Espero", "text": "Daewoo Espero\n\nThe Daewoo Espero (also known as Daewoo Aranos in some Spanish-speaking countries) is a four-door, five-seater mid-sized notchback saloon produced by the South Korean company Daewoo Motors from September 1990 to 1997. It was technically based on the GM J platform. The body was designed by Bertone. Daewoo also said that the Espero's design was their own work. It was done in a consultation with Italian design master Bertone. The car was equipped with a Holden-built GM Family 1 1.5 L engine, or the 1.8 or 2.0 L Family II engine. The Espero was replaced by the Daewoo Leganza in 1997.\n\nThe Espero was renamed Aranos in some but not all Spanish-speaking countries (not in Argentina and Chile for instance), since the word \"Espero\" means \"I hope\" in Spanish. Such a name was deemed less than marketable.\n\nThe development was actually started from the Citroën XM and Xantia in 1989, as Citroën were looking to make a middle class car. Many project designs were created, exterior as well as interior. Initially, the projects that are in the picture were to be won and this was what the Xantia was supposed to look like (because this was the model the projects were intended for). Ultimately, however, these two projects did not pass because Citroën said that they were too associated with their large family car - the Citroën XM. Daewoo, however, liked the project very much and bought it from the French (specifically the blue design). This project had been minimally modernized by Daewoo by the time the Espero debuted on the Korean market in August 1990. The Espero achieved very good results in the wind tunnel, at 0.29 Cd.\n\nThere was also a prototype that looked very similar to the Espero. This prototype is called DEV 2 (DEV meaning Daewoo Electric Vehicle) and was presented in 1995 at the Korea Motor Show in Seoul together with the Daewoo Bucrane concept, Tico concept, Nexia, Arcadia and the NGV3 concept. It was basically a version of the Espero but made out of recyclable materials which did not impact the environment. The DEV 2 had a redesigned front. This prototype was shown only in South Korea and only once at these fairs. It was painted white pearl and had 'DEV' badges in blue at the rear doors, its interior was white and the rims where a three spoke design and white as well. \n\nUnder the hood it was powered by an electric motor which was a water-cooled AC induction motor (86 kW) with performance figures with 0–100 km (0-60 mph) acceleration of 13 seconds. Top speed was around 85 mph. 22 new lead acid batteries were laid on the floor of the body, and one charge distance of 80 km (49.7 miles) was carried out.\n\nIt was said that the perfection was high but the performance and the range as an electric car was low.\n\nIn Korea, the Espero made its debut in August 1990. The styling was very different from the European Espero's, including no badge at the front but at the rear and on the steering wheel; the badge was black and had white three waves and white writing 'ESPERO' underneath it. The first version had different rear lights which the brake and indicator lights extended to the boot lid (though there were no illuminating lights at the boot lid) and differently styled hubcaps.\n\nIn the pre-facelift, the range consisted of two models, named '1.5 DOHC' (being the base model) which had standard hubcaps and then the '2.0 DOHC' which had different styled hubcaps. The '2.0 DOHC' also had a version with package, being the top of the range model.\n\nIn the cabin of the Korean Espero, a different steering wheel and an electronic dash was available with orange letters and accents. The steering wheel was slightly different from the three-spoke wheels in Europe, and more like the steering wheel from an Opel Vectra A/Vauxhall Cavalier MK3 except that the badge was different (again, the black emblem). No airbag was available. The front door cards were different: rather than the wrap-around design in European models, the vents were more square like and the grab handle was more ergonomic rather than just a pocket design. The centre console was flat and more angular.\n\nIn 1993, a facelift of the Espero was made. This included redesigned hubcaps (base model), a black badge saying 'ESPERO' at the rear, the rear lights were redesigned and now the black badge was put at the front. The boot opening was redesigned with a swivel badge over the keyhole to open the boot. This also meant the trim levels were revised, the base model being the 1.5 MPFi and the 2.0 MPFi (or with the package).\n\nIn 1994, a second facelift was made with the front logo changed from the black badge to a separated oval, with the same on the steering wheel). A new model was introduced, the 1.8 MPFi (which had alloy wheels and a 1.8 engine).\n\nProduction terminated in 1997.\n\nIn 1993, (2 adverts) they compared spacecraft technology and used racing drivers to demonstrate how powerful the Espero was.\n\nIn 1994, (second facelift) it was advertised that the Espero was available as the following models: 1.5 DOHC, 1.5 MPFi and the 2.0 DOHC.\n\nEuropean imports began in January 1995 when it was one of two cars (the other being the Nexia) in the first European Daewoo range.\n\nWhile the Nexia is based on the Astra Mk2 or Kadett E (GM's T-Type Platform), the Espero is based on the Cavalier Mk2 or Ascona C (GM's J-Type Platform). It sold well, thanks to its competitive asking price, notchback roofline with a steeply raked rear window, spacious interior, luggage compartment, impressive equipment levels and the comprehensive aftersales package.\n\nDespite the fact the Espero also featured couple of drawbacks as outdated interior design backing to the 80's, mediocre fuel economy and its body fairly prone to corrosion it still maintained popularity among price-conscious drivers.\n\nThe Espero was launched just months before the Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra A) was discontinued and the Vauxhall Vectra (Opel Vectra B), the Cavalier's replacement, was introduced.\n\nIn all European markets, there was option stickers at the back of the window in white writing ('ABS' for example).\n\nWhen Daewoo arrived in the UK at the beginning of 1995, Daewoo was aiming the Espero to the Cavalier and Mondeo market, plus providing good promotions and offers in the package. This included a 3 year/60,000 mile warranty (this could be extended to a 5 year/100,000 mile warranty for an extra £350), a six year anti-corrosion warranty, 3 years free servicing, maintenance and AA membership (which looked after breakdowns or accidents). Every replacement of parts were free, except for tires. If the car broke down, needed servicing or was in an accident, they would bring a courtesy car. Once the vehicle was fixed, they gave the vehicle back and collected the courtesy car (this was in the AA membership). Plus, there was free delivery number plates, one-year free road tax and a full tank of petrol. There was also a free 'N' plate replacement for a free upgrade for the first 1,000 customers who bought a new Daewoo; it would then be replaced in August 1995. Daewoo also provided fixed prices (no haggling) and they claimed this was the best way of selling a car.\n\nFrom 23 December 1996, another promotion was added, three years' free insurance.\n\nThese were the listed prices in the UK:\n\nGLXi - £10,695\n\nCDi - £11,995 (Not certain)\n\nCDXi - £12,250\n\nWith all the options selected, Daewoo claimed these prices were up to 40% less than its competitors.\n\nHowever, on 29 March 1996, Daewoo announced these prices were risen to the following (although the price of the 1.8 CDi remained the same) from 1 April 1996:\n\nGLXi: £11,495\n\nCDi: £11,995\n\nCDXi: £12,995\n\nThen, on 10 October 1996, Daewoo announced that the day after, they will extend the range of all their models with and without air-conditioning, so with the Espero GLXi, these were the following prices (* = without air-conditioning):\n\nGLXi*: £10,995\n\nGLXi: £11,495\n\nCDi: £11,995\n\nCDXi: £12,995\n\nOn 6 December 1996, Daewoo announced that from 9 December 1996 they will raise the prices of their range reflecting changes made to the vehicles for 1997 model year (Espero prices):\n\nGLXi: £11,735\n\nCDi: £12,375\n\nCDXi: £13,735\n\nIn the UK, the range consisted of three trim levels. The base model was the GLXi that had a 1.5 DOHC engine, GLXi emblems at the body wings and (some) boot, hubcaps, electric windows, ABS, power steering, drivers airbag, sunroof and radio/cassette. Air-conditioning was a free option (before, air-conditioning was an £880 option) so was automatic transmission from May 1996 onwards. Then, there was the CDi model which got a 1.8-litre SOHC engine for a step up, CDi emblems at the body wings and (some) '1.8 CDi' emblem at the boot though air-conditioning was standard. Alloy wheels were optional for the CDi model. Finally, there was the CDXi which had a 2.0-litre SOHC engine, CDXi emblems at the body wings, (some) '2.0 CDXi' emblem at the boot lid, alloy wheels and a CD player as well. From May 1996, a six-disc CD autochanger was standard on the 2.0 CDXi. All models got the same four-spoke steering wheel.\n\nThe Espero was also given an 'AUTOMATIC' badge at the boot lid for those which had an automatic transmission or (sometimes) a 'TWIN CAM 8v' badge on the 1.5 GLXi models. The dealer plates had the writing 'DAEWOO' in a black background with the phone number, a black line going through either side with the number plate ID under the number plate. In the UK, the Espero was not sold with a third brake light, a spoiler with a third brake light nor the three-spoke steering wheel.\n\nWhen AA (Automobile Association) tested the Espero CDi in October 1995, they rated it high because of its aftersales package and equipment it provided but criticised because of its electrical issues and lacking some safety features. In conclusion, they claimed that it was like 'cash-and-carry groceries or 'flat-pack-furniture from a warehouse store' which meant it did the job as a decent family car but this lied to the fact that it was new at the time yet it was generously priced and equipped than anything else at the price.\n\nPlus, AA (Automobile Association) later did an extension test in a revamped Espero 1.8 CDi in July 1996 to see their experience with it. They had a few niggles with it but as time moved on it had less problems. Overall, they claimed that ride and fuel economy is reasonable. In the 1996 revamp (although pre-facelifts were sold at the time), this included four-shot washer jets rather than two shot ones, door mirrors fold flush with body flanks, indicator fenders revised, rear light housings in boot less vulnerable, gear lever surround modified and a better RDS radio.\n\nPeople were not sure what was the replacement for the Espero (though it was claimed to be the Leganza), but a new Daewoo range was added in September 1997 (Lanos, Nubira, Leganza) and in 1998 the Matiz. Despite this, the Espero was sold until December 1997 (late R reg examples).\n\nOne of the main reasons the Espero became so rare was because of an ABS control module which was not only difficult to replace but also very expensive when it was faulty. This led to many MOT failures so many owners got rid of their Esperos. Plus, there were lots of electrical problems (central locking, wiper, radio, light faults). Also, their resale value was very low so it depreciated rapidly as soon as their warranties ran out so these are considered worth little value. Spare parts were also quite difficult to find as they did not sell well in the first place and the fact that because the Korean economy was affected, so Daewoo could not provide much spare parts.\n\nIn Poland, there were only two models, GLX and CD. The base model 'GLX' came with a 1.5 litre DOHC engine, a three-spoke steering wheel, electric windows, hubcaps, (some) a third brake light and a 'DOHC 16V' badge at the back (for colour reasons, the badge is black if the car is white and white if the car is in another colour). No airbags were available for the GLX model. The pricier 'CD' model came with a 1.8 SOHC or a 2.0 SOHC engine, a four-spoke steering wheel with (some) a drivers airbag (though some still had a three-spoke one), and (some) air-conditioning.\n\nThe Espero was praised however for its durability and long-term reliability, so taxi drivers used them quite a lot.\n\nProduction started in 1996. Very shortly there was a facelift at the same year (revised door mirrors and indicator fenders). Poland was the only country that offered the Espero the longest in production which ended in December 1999. In 2000 the last copies could be purchased from the showrooms. No wonder that interest in Espero has fallen, since Nubira was extremely popular in Poland and the Nubira II was announced in 2000.\n\nWhen Auto Śwait tested the Espero 2.0 CD back in January 1996, they claimed that it was decent to drive, spacious and had an outdated 80's interior design. In their conclusion its far-eastern competitors were doing a better job (Nissan Primera, Mazda 626) and the fact that 'attractive prices and rich furnishings will convince them of the \"Korean\" - and these are not the worst argument these days.'\n\nIn Netherlands, the market started in 1995 and terminated in 1997. There were two trim levels with three engines. The base model was named 'GLX' with a 1.5 DOHC engine and also what Poland got. Then, there was the second model which was named 'CD' and had either a 1.8 SOHC engine or a 2.0 SOHC engine. The 1.8 litre and the 2.0 litre had hubcaps as standard but some got air-conditioning. Automatic transmission, a spoiler and different types of alloy wheels were optional on all models.\n\nPromotions were provided, this included a 3 month/3,000 km refund period, 3 year/50,000 km maintenance warranty, 3 year/100,000 km warranty, 3-year paint warranty and a 6 year anti-corrosion warranty.\n\nA facelift was introduced in 1996, including revamped door mirrors and indicator fenders.\nLimited edition models included the 'Executive' which basically was a sumptuous version of the Espero. The badges were located at the body wings, had alloy wheels, it had automatic transmission and had wooden trims inside for a more executive look. This was actually a package rather than a separate model. There was also the 'Colour Design' model which had special type alloy wheels.\n\nDepending on the specification, these were the following prices:\nThe Espero was marketed as 'Aranos' because the word 'Espero' translated to 'I hope'. Production started in 1995. There were two trim levels, 'GLX' and 'CDX'. The GLX was the base model which had a 1.5 DOHC engine with all other extras (power windows, power mirrors, hubcaps, (some) 'DOHC 16V' badge). Then there was the CDX which was available with either a 1.8 or a 2.0 SOHC engine. Other equipment included air-conditioning. A spoiler with a third brake light and different type alloy wheels were optional.\n\nA facelift was introduced in 1996, including revamped door mirrors and indicator fenders.\n\nIn 1994, the production of the Espero was started. The badging and details were just like the second facelift Espero in Korea (being in 1994). The following models were sold:\n\n\nThe CD was the top-of-the-range model which included all the necessary extras with some optional options: electric sunroof, 'CD' emblems at body wings, leather seats, Drivers' Air Bag, ABS, CD Player and automatic transmission. All models had the three spoke steering wheel (see Poland section).\n\nIn 1995, the Espero was updated which included new badging, the 'knickers' like badge, exterior and interior. However, the rear 'ESPERO' black badge remained. Only one trim level was available (CD) and only one engine was offered throughout production, the 2.0 litre GM Family II engine. Some Espero's had the '2000i' emblem at the back to represent this. Production terminated in 1998.\n\nWhen Daewoo first came in Australia, they used the slogan in their advert, \"The Daewoo Espero. Beware of expensive imitations\". They claimed the boot was bigger than the Commodore and the Falcon and they also provided promotions which included a (whichever came first) 3 year/100,000 km warranty. The starting price was from $23,750.\n\nIn Australia it was sold from 1995 to 1997 before it was claimed to be replaced by the Leganza. Throughout its production, it was only powered by one engine, the 2.0 litre GM Family II engine. This engine was Australian built and was exported to other countries for assembly. There was also only one trim level, it was called the 'CD'. It was well equipped, this included all-round electric windows and electric mirrors, a 5-speed manual gearbox, air-conditioning, power steering, remote trunk release and an AM/FM stereo radio with a CD player. There was also 'ESPERO 2.0i' emblems in white at the side skirts for the rear doors which no other markets have. The only optional items were a 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive and ABS/Airbag (combined safety option). The steering wheel was a three spoke design which was included for other markets (see Poland section) and the automatic transmission lever and writings had a different design as well.\n\nIn 1996, there was a facelift which included revamped wing mirrors and indicator fenders.\n\nIn Top Gear 1997, the Espero was placed 39th out of 120 in an 'N' registration JD power survey. This was due to the fact that it had too much electrical and miscellaneous problems.\n\nAlso, Top Gear tested out both Nexia and Espero models to see the experience of how they fared against its rivals. They said the way the Espero drove was 'pretty dull and undynamic' because it had ancient Vauxhall Cavalier mechanicals however reliability was reasonable, the resale value was average and according to the people's experience they were well-warrantied, reliable and a manufacturer who cared more than most.\n\nSome claim that the Espero has some design hints from other cars:\n\n\nThe Espero had some unusual quirks unlike some of its rivals:\n\n"}
{"id": "1822961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822961", "title": "Electron crystallography", "text": "Electron crystallography\n\nElectron crystallography is a method to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids using a transmission electron microscope (TEM).\n\nIt can complement X-ray crystallography for studies of very small crystals (<0.1 micrometers), both inorganic, organic, and proteins, such as membrane proteins, that cannot easily form the large 3-dimensional crystals required for that process. Protein structures are usually determined from either 2-dimensional crystals (sheets or helices), polyhedrons such as viral capsids, or dispersed individual proteins. Electrons can be used in these situations, whereas X-rays cannot, because electrons interact more strongly with atoms than X-rays do. Thus, X-rays will travel through a thin 2-dimensional crystal without diffracting significantly, whereas electrons can be used to form an image. Conversely, the strong interaction between electrons and protons makes thick (e.g. 3-dimensional > 1 micrometer) crystals impervious to electrons, which only penetrate short distances.\n\nOne of the main difficulties in X-ray crystallography is determining phases in the diffraction pattern. Because of the complexity of X-ray lenses, it is difficult to form an image of the crystal being diffracted, and hence phase information is lost. Fortunately, electron microscopes can resolve atomic structure in real space and the crystallographic structure factor phase information can be experimentally determined from an image's Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of an atomic resolution image is similar, but different, to a diffraction pattern—with reciprocal lattice spots reflecting the symmetry and spacing of a crystal. Aaron Klug was the first to realize that the phase information could be read out directly from the Fourier transform of an electron microscopy image that had been scanned into a computer, already in 1968. For this, and his studies on virus structures and transfer-RNA, Klug received the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1982.\n\nA common problem to X-ray crystallography and electron crystallography is radiation damage, by which especially organic molecules and proteins are damaged as they are being imaged, limiting the resolution that can be obtained. This is especially troublesome in the setting of electron crystallography, where that radiation damage is focused on far fewer atoms. One technique used to limit radiation damage is electron cryomicroscopy, in which the samples undergo cryofixation and imaging takes place at liquid nitrogen or even liquid helium temperatures. Because of this problem, X-ray crystallography has been much more successful in determining the structure of proteins that are especially vulnerable to radiation damage. Radiation damage was recently investigated using MicroED of thin 3D crystals in a frozen hydrated state.\n\nThe first electron crystallographic protein structure to achieve atomic resolution was bacteriorhodopsin, determined by Richard Henderson and coworkers at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in 1990. However, already in 1975 Unwin and Henderson had determined the first membrane protein structure at intermediate resolution (7 Ångström), showing for the first time the internal structure of a membrane protein, with its alpha-helices standing perpendicular to the plane of the membrane. Since then, several other high-resolution structures have been determined by electron crystallography, including the light-harvesting complex, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and the bacterial flagellum. The highest resolution protein structure solved by electron crystallography of 2D crystals is that of the water channel aquaporin-0. In 2013 electron crystallography was extended to 3D crystals by a new method called microcrystal electron diffraction, or MicroED.\n\nElectron crystallographic studies on inorganic crystals using high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) images were first performed by Aaron Klug in 1978 and by Sven Hovmöller and coworkers in 1984. HREM images were used because they allow to select (by computer software) only the very thin regions close to the edge of the crystal for structure analysis (see also crystallographic image processing). This is of crucial importance since in the thicker parts of the crystal the exit-wave function (which carries the information about the intensity and position of the projected atom columns) is no longer linearly related to the projected crystal structure. Moreover, not only do the HREM images change their appearance with increasing crystal thickness, they are also very sensitive to the chosen setting of the defocus Δf of the objective lens (see the HREM images of for example). To cope with this complexity Michael O'Keefe started in the early 1970s to develop image simulation software which allowed to understand an interpret the observed contrast changes in HREM images.\n\nThere was a serious disagreement in the field of electron microscopy of inorganic compounds; while some have claimed that \"the phase information is present in EM images\" others have the opposite view that \"the phase information is lost in EM images\". The reason for these opposite views is that the word \"phase\" has been used with different meanings in the two communities of physicists and crystallographers. The physicists are more concerned about the \"electron wave phase\" - the phase of a wave moving through the sample during exposure by the electrons. This wave has a wavelength of about 0.02-0.03 Ångström (depending on the accelerating voltage of the electron microscope). Its phase is related to the phase of the undiffracted direct electron beam. The crystallographers, on the other hand, mean the \"crystallographic structure factor phase\" when they simply say \"phase\". This phase is the phase of standing waves of potential in the crystal (very similar to the electron density measured in X-ray crystallography). Each of these waves have their specific wavelength, called d-value for distance between so-called Bragg planes of low/high potential. These d-values range from the unit cell dimensions to the resolution limit of the electron microscope, i.e. typically from 10 or 20 Ångströms down to 1 or 2 Ångströms. Their phases are related to a fixed point in the crystal, defined in relation to the symmetry elements of that crystal. The crystallographic phases are a property of the crystal, so they exist also outside the electron microscope. The electron waves vanish if the microscope is switched off. In order to determine a crystal structure, it is necessary to know the crystallographic structure factors, but not to know the electron wave phases. A more detailed discussion how (crystallographic structure factor) phases link with the phases of the electron wave can be found in.\n\nJust as with proteins, it has been possible to determine the atomic structures of inorganic crystals by electron crystallography. For simpler structure it is sufficient to use three perpendicular views, but for more complicated structures, also projections down ten or more different diagonals may be needed.\n\nIn addition to electron microscopy images, it is also possible to use electron diffraction (ED) patterns for crystal structure determination. The utmost care must be taken to record such ED patterns from the thinnest areas in order to keep most of the structure related intensity differences between the reflections (quasi-kinematical diffraction conditions). Just as with X-ray diffraction patterns, the important crystallographic structure factor phases are lost in electron diffraction patterns and must be uncovered by special crystallographic methods such as direct methods, maximum likelihood or (more recently) by the charge-flipping method. On the other hand, ED patterns of inorganic crystals have often a high resolution (= interplanar spacings with high Miller indices) much below 1 Ångström. This is comparable to the point resolution of the best electron microscopes. Under favourable conditions it is possible to use ED patterns from a single orientation to determine the complete crystal structure. Alternatively a hybrid approach can be used which uses HRTEM images for solving and intensities from ED for refining the crystal structure.\n\nRecent progress for structure analysis by ED was made by introducing the Vincent-Midgley precession technique for recording electron diffraction patterns. The thereby obtained intensities are usually much closer to the kinematical intensities, so that even structures can be determined that are out of range when processing conventional (selected area) electron diffraction data.\n\nCrystal structures determined via electron crystallography can be checked for their quality by using first-principles calculations within density functional theory (DFT). This approach was for the first time applied for the validation of several metal-rich structures which were only accessible by HRTEM and ED, respectively.\n\nRecently, two very complicated zeolite structures have been determined by electron crystallography combined with X-ray powder diffraction. These are more complex than the most complex zeolite structures determined by X-ray crystallography.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1822962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822962", "title": "Daewoo Lanos", "text": "Daewoo Lanos\n\nThe Daewoo Lanos is a subcompact car produced by the South Korean manufacturer Daewoo from 1997 to 2002, and thereafter produced under license agreements in various countries worldwide. It has also been marketed as the Daewoo Sens, ZAZ Sens and ZAZ Lanos in Ukraine, Doninvest Assol and ZAZ Chance in Russia, FSO Lanos in Poland, or Chevrolet Lanos in Ukraine, Russia, and Egypt.\n\nIt was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro and initially featured three body styles: three-door and five-door hatchbacks and a four-door sedan. The Lanos was designated the T100 model code at launch; the T150 code applies to the updated models introduced in 1999. In 2006, a panel van version, developed in Ukraine by ZAZ, was also introduced. The Daewoo Lanos was designed to replace the Daewoo Nexia in the Daewoo line-up and was itself replaced by the Daewoo Kalos.\n\nIn 1992, Daewoo dissolved its joint-venture with General Motors, and simultaneously a decision was made to independently develop replacements for the contemporary Daewoo Motors products, based on older General Motors models. The Lanos development programme was formally started in autumn 1993, with the goal to create a car to replace Daewoo Nexia as Daewoo's small family car.\n\nThe project began with a comparative study of competing models from 20 different manufacturers, with Toyota Tercel, Opel Astra and Volkswagen Golf identified as most competitive. Four design studios were commissioned to deliver clay models presenting their ideas for the new model's styling. Giorgetto Giugiaro's design was chosen, and Italdesign was commissioned to develop the car's final outside and interior styling. The technical side of the project was conducted simultaneously by Daewoo's development centre Korea, as well as suppliers and contractors who were involved in developing particular components. This included AC Rochester (engine components), Delco Chassis Division (brakes, including ABS), GM Powertrain (automatic transmission), Italdesign (body, structural analysis, electrics, prototype construction), PARS Passive Rückhaltesysteme GmbH (airbags) and Porsche (vehicle concept – research, structural analysis, suspension and brake components, and experimental production supervision).\n\nBy the end of 1995, 150 prototypes were built (providing for three body styles). The development programme involved extensive testing in a multitude of locations. Safety tests included high-speed stability and durability testing in England, and brake testing on the Großglockner in Austria. Low-temperature testing was conducted in Canada, Sweden (Arjeplog), and Russia (Moscow, Khabarovsk) while high-temperature tests took place in the US (Death Valley), Oman (Nizwa), Australia (Alice Springs), Spain (Barcelona), and Italy (Nardò). The programme was completed in a remarkable time of only 30 months from the approval to the commencement of large-scale production of the Lanos sedan for the Korean market. European-market production began in 1997.\n\nThe cars were equipped with E-TEC I4 with single cam and twin cam engines ranging from 1.5 L (1498 cc 86HP) SOHC to 1.6 L (1598 cc 106HP) DOHC. In the UK and many countries of Europe (like Italy, France or Austria) there are also E-TEC models 1.4 (1349 cc 75HP) and 1.6 (1598 cc 106HP). The suspension is built upon that of a Daewoo Nexia, as used in Vauxhall/Opel Astra Mk2 GTE.\n\nOn the mechanical side, all Lanos versions shared the same parts with a few exceptions. Differences between the 1.6 DOHC engine version and the other versions were:\n\nThe four models available were S, SE, SE Plus, SX, and later, the SPORT model. The S was the base model and did not include many standard features (like a CD player or power windows). The SE was just a small step up from the S base model. However, the SX model usually included a CD, radio, and cassette player along with power windows, a power side mirror, and fog lights. A few select SX models even came with a sun-roof, though not many did. In the Lanos's later years, the SE and SX models were dropped and replaced with a new trim line called the SPORT (2001–2002). The SPORT included several features similar to the SX, but also included red/black leather seats and a metallic silver dash trim. Also, the SPORT model had window controls located on the doors rather than the center console (like in the previous trim lines).\n\nOutside South Korea, the Lanos has been produced in Poland (from 1997 to 2008), Ukraine (from 1998 to present), Russia (briefly produced, starting in 1998), Egypt (from 1998 to present) and Vietnam (from 2000 to 2006). Most of the initial production was made using complete knock down (CKD) kits, which were supplied to FSO (in Poland), ZAZ (in Ukraine), TagAZ (in Russia), Daewoo Motors Egypt and GM Egypt (in Egypt) and VIDAMCO (in Vietnam).\n\nFrom 2002, ZAZ equipped some of the kits with a domestic MeMZ-307 engine and sold this version under the Daewoo Sens name; this practice continues with the start of full-scale production of model T150. In December 2004, ZAZ adopted the Lanos chassis for full-scale production and installed new welding and painting lines. From March 2009, the updated version is called ZAZ Lanos (internal model T150). The engines are still supplied by GM Daewoo, although a Chinese-developed engine from Chery Automobile has been fitted and there are plans to build the 1.6 L engine at the MeMZ plant.\n\nIn Poland, the Fabryka Samochodów Osobowych (FSO) plant in Warsaw began the production of the Lanos in 1998. Since January 2005, after the takeover of Daewoo by General Motors, the Lanos produced in Poland started to be sold under the brand name of FSO. It was produced until 2008, but only with the pre-facelift external design.\n\nIn 2005, General Motors contracted with ZAZ to provide Ukrainian-assembled Lanos models for the Ukrainian and Russian markets, to be imported duty-free, thanks to an international agreement, and sold through the GM dealer network. Sales of the Chevrolet Lanos sedan commenced in Russia in November 2005. The Chevrolet brand was utilized to compete effectively with the Renault Logan. From July 2009, it is marketed in Russia as ZAZ Chance.\n\nIn 2006, a panel van variant of the ZAZ Lanos was introduced.\n\nSince late 1998, the Daewoo Motor Egypt factory in Cairo started the assembly of the Daewoo Lanos in both 4 door and 5 door shells with the 1.5 SOHC engine. The hatchback version was called \"Juliet\". The 4 door was available in two versions:\n\nThe 5 door version of the Lanos (AKA Juliet) came with full options and manual transmission.\n\nNear the end of year 2000 the Lanos was introduced with a different rear end design and a face lifted front (different front bumper and grill). It was called \"Lanos II\" in this particular market. An SE version came with all the options plus the manual transmission. The automatic transmission version was stopped shortly after the introduction of the \"Lanos II\".\n\nBetween mid 2000 and 2001 the factory produced an even more frugal 4 door version of the Lanos II with no options at all but a cassette and those were sold by the Egyptian ministry of defense to army officers with a decently low price compared to the car's value at that time.\n\nThe facelifting also included the five-door Juliet to have the same changes as the 4 door version on the front but on the rear it only had a different design tail-lights and bumper rather than a wholly different design rear end like the sedan, the production of the Juliet stopped within 2005.\n\nIn November 2008, GM Egypt started producing the Chevrolet Lanos in 6th of October City, from Ukrainian supplied kits.\n\nThe Lanos was finally phased out after the 2002 model year, superseded worldwide by the Daewoo Kalos. Daewoo ceased operations in North America. After GM took over Daewoo to become GMDAT, Chevrolet began importing the Daewoo Kalos, rebadged as the Aveo, to North America beginning with MY 2004. However, the Lanos continues to be sold in Mexico and Latin America.\n\nThe 2001 and 2002 models follow a recent trend among cars intended to be sold in many markets, in that their rear lamps are asymmetric, with the fog lamp and reverse lamp occupying complementary spots on the driver's side and passenger side respectively; consequently, the rear lamps differ between left- and right-hand drive examples.\n\nIn Ukraine, the Lanos has been the best-selling car since at least 2006, and until 2014 (except 2012), being produced by the local manufacturer ZAZ under its own brand (starting from 2005).\n\nIn Australia, the 1997–2003 Daewoo Lanos was assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings 2006 as providing \"worse than average\" protection for its occupants in the event of a crash.\n\nEurope: models received the following European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) 1998 ratings:\nIn crash tests conducted by ANCAP in 1998 to EuroNCAP regulations RHD Lanos 3dr hatchback showed poor performance, scoring 0.31 out of 16 in offset front crash test and 6.98 of 16 in side impact test.\nRussian magazine Autoreview tested LHD Chevrolet Lanos T150 sedan built by ZAZ in 2006. It scored 10.5 of 16 points in offset front crash test.\n\n"}

{"id": "1822980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822980", "title": "All I Want for Christmas Is You", "text": "All I Want for Christmas Is You\n\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" is a Christmas song recorded by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey. She co-wrote and co-produced it with Walter Afanasieff for her fourth studio album and first holiday album, \"Merry Christmas\" (1994). Columbia Records released it as the lead single from the album on October 29, 1994. The track is an uptempo love song that includes bell chimes, heavy back-up vocals, and synthesizers.\n\nUpon release, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" has been critically acclaimed, with \"The New Yorker\" calling it \"one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon.\" The song remains Carey's biggest international success, reaching number one in numerous countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United States. In 2019, the song topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for the first time, 25 years after its original release, thus breaking several records, including the longest trip to number one. With an estimated sales of over 16 million copies, it remains the best selling Christmas single by a female artist and one of the best-selling singles of all time. As of 2017, the song was reported to have earned $60 million in royalties.\n\nTwo music videos were originally commissioned for the song. The primary video features grainy home-movie-style footage of Carey, her dogs and family during the holiday season, as well as Carey dressed in a Santa suit frolicking on a snowy mountainside. Carey's then-husband Tommy Mottola makes a cameo appearance as Santa Claus, bringing Carey a gift and leaving on a red sleigh. The second video was filmed in black and white, and features Carey dressed in 1960s style in homage to The Ronettes, alongside back up singers and female dancers. A third music video directed by Joseph Kahn was released in 2019 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the song.\n\nCarey has performed \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" during numerous live television appearances and tours throughout her career. In 2010, Carey re-recorded the song for her second holiday album, \"Merry Christmas II You\" (2010), titled \"All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)\". Carey also re-recorded the song as a duet with Canadian singer Justin Bieber for his 2011 album \"Under the Mistletoe\", titled \"All I Want for Christmas Is You (SuperFestive!)\". It has become established as a Christmas standard and continues to surge in popularity each holiday season. The song has also been covered by many artists over the years.\n\nFollowing the success of the singer's 1993 career best-selling album \"Music Box\", Carey and her management at Columbia Records began devising ideas and strategies for subsequent projects. Carey's then-husband, Tommy Mottola, head of Columbia's parent label Sony Music Entertainment, began mapping out possible follow ups for the singer during the pinnacle years of her career. During initial discussions regarding the thought of doing a Christmas-themed album with Carey and her songwriting partner of over four years, Walter Afanasieff, the fear arose that it was not commercially expedient or wise to release holiday music at the peak of one's career, as it was more often equated with a release towards the end of a musician's waning career.\n\nAfanasieff recalled his sentiments during initial discussions for a holiday record: \"Back then, you didn't have a lot of artists with Christmas albums. It wasn't a known science at all back then, and there was nobody who did new, big Christmas songs. So we were going to release it as kind of an everyday, 'Hey, you know, we're putting out a Christmas album. No big deal.'\" Ultimately, with Mottola's persistence, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and composing songs for its parent album, \"Merry Christmas\", during the summer of 1994. Carey began decorating the home she then shared with Mottola in upstate New York (which also came equipped with a personal recording studio) with Christmas ornaments and other holiday-inspired trinkets. In doing so, Carey felt she could capture the essence and spirit of what she was singing and make her vocal performance and delivery more emotive and authentic. \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" was recorded that August, and took Carey and Afanasieff a total of fifteen minutes to write and compose.\nAt first, Afanasieff admitted that he was puzzled and \"blanched\" as to where Carey wanted to take the melody and vocal scales, though she was \"adamant\" in her direction for the song. In an interview with \"Billboard,\" Afanasieff described the type of relationship he and Carey shared in the studio and as songwriters for the song and in general:\n\nIt was always the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as we finished writing it. I started playing some rock 'n' roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing my left hand, and that inspired Mariah to come up with the melodic [Sings.] 'I don't want a lot for Christmas.' And then we started singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I tried to make it a little more unique, putting in some special chords that you really don't hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.\n\nThen for the next week or two Mariah would call me and say, 'What do you think about this bit?' We would talk a little bit until she got the lyrics all nicely coordinated and done. And then we just waited until the sessions began, which were in the summer of '94 where we got together in New York and started recording. And that's when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.\n\nAfanasieff flew back to California, where he finished the song's programming and production. Originally, he had a live band play the drums and other instruments with the thought of giving it a more raw and affective sound. He was unhappy with the results of the recording and subsequently scrapped the effort and used his original, personal arrangement and programmed all the instruments heard on the song (with the exception of the background vocals) including the piano, effects, drums and triangle. While Carey continued writing material in her rented home in The Hamptons, Afanasieff completed the song's programming and awaited to rendezvous with her a final time in order to layer and harmonize the background vocals.\n\nIn touching on several aspects of what excited her to record and release her Christmas album, Carey went into detail on what writing and recording the song and album meant for her, pointing out, \"I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays. I've sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl. I used to go Christmas caroling. When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs. It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, but for the most part people really want to hear the standards at Christmas time, no matter how good a new song is.\"\n\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" is an uptempo song, composed with pop, soul, R&B, gospel, dance-pop and adult contemporary influences and stylings. By early August, Carey already had two original songs written alongside Afanasieff: the \"sad and ballad-y\" \"Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)\" and the \"Gospel-tinged and religious\" \"Jesus Born on This Day\". The third and final original song the pair planned to write was to be centered and inspired and in the vein of a \"Phil Spector, old rock 'n roll, sixties-sounding Christmas song\".\n\nThe song begins with a \"sparking\" bit of percussion \"that resembles an antique music box or a whimsical snow globe.\" After Carey's a cappella style vocal introduction, the song introduces other seasonal percussive signifiers including; celebratory church-like bells, cheerful sleigh bells, and \"an underlying rhythmic beat that sounds like the loping pace of a horse or reindeer. These sounds echo religious and secular musical touchstones, without veering blatantly too much in either direction, and give the song an upbeat, joyous tone.\"\nIn an interview in 1994, Carey described the song as \"fun\", and continued: \"It's very traditional, old-fashioned Christmas. It's very retro, kind of '60s.\" Afanasieff went further in breaking down the song's musical elements: \"A lush bed of keyboards, reminiscent of a small-scale Wall of Sound, cushions the song's cheery rhythms, while a soulful vocal chorus adds robust oohs, tension-creating counter-melodies, and festive harmonies. Most notably, however, the song's jaunty piano chords and melody keep the song merrily bouncing along.\"\n\nLyrically, the song describes the yearning desire to be with a loved one for Christmas, regardless of whether they have to forgo the usual commercial aspect of the holiday season such as ornamental lights, trees, snow and presents. The song incorporates various instruments, including piano, drums, violin, oboe, flute, bell chimes, bass effect, and cowbells. The song layers background vocals throughout the chorus and sections of the bridge.\n\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" is played at an original tempo of 150.162 beats per minute. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in common time and in the key of G major. Carey's vocal range in the song spans from the note of G to the high note of A. Carey wrote the song's lyrics and melody, while Afanasieff arranged and produced the piece with synthetically created computerized equipment.\n\n\"Slate\"s Ragusea counts \"at least 13 distinct chords at work, resulting in a sumptuously chromatic melody. The song also includes what I consider the most Christmassy chord of all—a minor subdominant, or 'iv,' chord with an added 6, under the words 'underneath the Christmas tree,' among other places. (You might also analyze it as a half-diminished 'ii' 7th chord, but either interpretation seems accurate).\" According to Roch Parisien from AllMusic, the song contains \"The Beach Boys-style harmonies, jangling bells, and a sleigh-ride pace, injecting one of the few bits of exuberant fun in this otherwise vanilla set.\"\n\nCritics have noted the song's 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s influences which, in conjunction with Carey's voice and its simple melody, heralded its recipe for success. In discussing the song's chord progression and stylistic approaches, \"Slate\"s Adam Ragusea hailed the song as \"the only Christmas song written in the last half-century worthy of inclusion in the Great American Songbook.\" \"The A.V. Club\"s Annie Zaleski attributes the song's enduring appeal to its ambiguity in being able to pin it down as belonging to a specific era.\n\nCritics also noted the song a tad reminiscent of the works of Judy Garland and Nat King Cole, while also describing it as hearkening back to \"'60s and '70s Motown covers of prewar Christmas classics, such as The Jackson 5's [and] Stevie Wonder\". \"Slate\"s Ragusea conceded that \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" \"sounds like it could have been written in the '40s and locked in a Brill Building safe.\" In a piece on the song in \"Vogue\", a writer felt the song's lyrics helped solidify its status over two decades later: \"those lyrics could have been sung by Frank Sinatra—well, maybe not Frank, but another singer back then. I think that's what gives it that timeless, classic quality.\"\n\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" received critical acclaim. Parisien called the song \"a year-long banger\", complimenting its instrumentation and melody. Steve Morse, editor of \"The Boston Globe\", wrote that Carey sang with a lot of soul. According to Barry Schwartz from \"Stylus Magazine\", \"to say this song is an instant classic somehow doesn't capture its amazingicity; it's a modern standard: joyous, exhilarating, loud, with even a hint of longing.\" Schwartz praised the song's lyrics as well, describing them as \"beautifully phrased,\" and calling Carey's voice \"gorgeous\" and \"sincere.\"\n\nKyle Anderson from MTV labeled the track \"a majestic anthem full of chimes, sleigh bells, doo-wop flourishes, sweeping strings and one of the most dynamic and clean vocal performances of Carey's career\". While reviewing the 2009 remix version, Becky Bain from Idolator called the song a \"timeless classic\" and wrote, \"We love the original song to pieces—we blast it while decorating our Christmas tree and lighting our Menorah.\"\n\nShona Craven of Scotland's \"The Herald\", said, \"[it's] a song of optimism and joy that maybe, just maybe, hints at the real meaning of Christmas.\" Additionally, she felt the main reason it was so successful is the subject \"you\" in the lyrics, explaining, \"Perhaps what makes the song such a huge hit is the fact that it's for absolutely everyone.\" Craven opened her review with a bold statement: \"Bing Crosby may well be turning in his grave, but no child of the 1980s will be surprised to see Mariah Carey's sublime All I Want For Christmas Is You bounding up the charts after being named the nation's top festive song.\"\n\nIn his review for Carey's \"Merry Christmas II You\", Thomas Connor from the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" called the song \"a simple, well-crafted chestnut and one of the last great additions to the Christmas pop canon\". In a 2006 retrospective look at Carey's career, Sasha Frere-Jones of \"The New Yorker\" said, the \"charming\" song was one of Carey's biggest accomplishments, calling it \"one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon\". Dan Hancox, editor of \"The National\", quoted and agreed with Jones' statement, calling the song \"perfection\".\n\nIn the United States, in the first week of January 1995, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" peaked at No. 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Adult Contemporary and at No. 12 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. The song placed on these two charts again in December 1995 and in December 1996. The song was ineligible for inclusion on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 during its original release, because it was not released commercially as a single. This rule lapsed in 1998, however, allowing the song to chart on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 (peaking at No. 83 in January 2000). The song topped the \"Billboard\" Hot Digital Songs chart in December 2005, but it was unable to attain a new peak on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart because it was considered a recurrent single and was thus ineligible for chart re-entry.\n\nEvery December from 2005 to 2008, the song topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Re-currents chart. In 2012, after the recurrent rule was revised to allow all songs in the top 50 onto the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, the single re-entered the chart at No. 29 and peaked at No. 21 for the week ending January 5, 2013. In December 2017, the song reached No. 9 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, giving Carey her 28th top 10 in the country and first since \"Obsessed\" in 2009. \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" subsequently rose to No. 3 on the chart dated January 5, 2019, becoming the second holiday track to reach its top 5 after \"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)\" by David Seville and the Chipmunks peaked at No. 1 in 1958. As of January 4, 2020, it has topped the \"Billboard\" Holiday 100 chart for a record-extending 40 cumulative weeks. No other song has spent more than two weeks at No. 1 on the Holiday 100 since the chart's launch in 2011.\n\nIt returned to its No. 3 Hot 100 peak on the chart dated December 14, 2019. On the chart dated December 21, 2019, \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" topped the Hot 100 in the United States with 45.6 million streams and 27,000 digital sales sold. It reached the top spot after 35 cumulative weeks on the chart, making it the slowest climb to the top spot in the chart's history, surpassing \"Macarena (Bayside Boys Remix)\" by Los del Río which reached number one in August 1996 after 33 weeks on the chart. Additionally, it broke the record for the longest trip to the number one position, reaching the spot 25 years after the song's original release. With \"All I Want For Christmas is You\", Carey extended her record of having the most number-one songs for a solo artist on the Hot 100 with nineteen and Carey achieved a record-extending 80th week at number-one on the Hot 100. Although released in 1994, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" was the last number-one single of the 2010s decade, as well as the first number-one of the 2020s decade, spending a third week atop the Hot 100 chart dated January 4, 2020, and in doing so, Carey became the first artist in history to rule the chart in four separate decades: 1990s, 2000s, 2010s & 2020s chart.\n\nIt has become the first holiday ringtone to be certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Additionally, of songs recorded before the year 2000, it is the best-selling digital single by a woman, as well as the overall best-selling holiday digital single. As of December 2019, total sales of the digital track according to Nielsen SoundScan was 3,588,000. On the US \"Rolling Stone\" 100, the song topped the charts during the week of December 12, 2019, becoming Carey's first number-one song on the chart, and fourteenth overall to reach the top of the chart.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 5 during the week of December 10, 1994. The following week, the song peaked at number 2, staying there for the final three weeks of December (held out of the coveted \"Christmas No. 1\" honor by East 17's \"Stay Another Day\"). As of January 27, 2017, it had spent seventy-eight weeks on the UK Singles Chart. As of December 19, 2013, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" has sold one million copies in the UK. On December 13, 2019, it was certified quadruple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry for shipment of 2.4 million units (including streams) and remains Carey's best-selling single in the UK. In 2010, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" was named the No. 1 holiday song of the decade in the United Kingdom. The song peaked at number 2 in the United Kingdom for a second time in December 2017 due to strong downloads and streaming. It has since reached number 2 again twice; in 2018 and in 2019.\n\nThe song originally peaked at No. 2 on the Australian Singles Chart in 1994, and was certified five-times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipments of over 350,000 units. \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" topped the chart in December 2018, becoming the first Christmas song to do so in the 21st century and giving Carey her third number-one song in the country after \"Fantasy\" in 1995 and \"We Belong Together\" in 2005. This also made her the eleventh musical act to reach the country's summit in three back-to-back decades. It additionally was the first Christmas track since \"Snoopy's Christmas\" by The Royal Guardsmen in 1967 to peak at number one in Australia during the Christmas season. The song also topped the New Zealand Charts for the first time in 2018, making Carey's eighth number-one single in the country. In Denmark, it peaked at No. 4, staying in the chart for sixteen weeks and being certified gold by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).\n\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" became Carey's best-selling single in Japan. It was used as the theme song to the popular drama , and was titled . The single peaked at No. 2 for two weeks, blocked from the top spot by \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and \"Everybody Goes\", both released by rock band Mr. Children. It sold in excess of 1.1 million units in Japan. Due to strong sales and airplay, the song re-charted in Japan in 2010, peaking at No. 6 on the Japan Hot 100. The single has been certified the Million award by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) on two different formats (compact disc and ringtone), in 1994 and 2008, respectively.\n\nOn December 25, 2018, the song set the single-day record for the most Spotify streams, with 10.82 million plays. After having been subsequently surpassed by Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber's \"I Don't Care, \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" re-broke the record exactly a year later with 12.029 million streams in a single day. As of December 2019, the song has earned more than $2 million in royalties since it was first added to Spotify.\n\nWhen the song was first released as a single in 1994, no remixes were commissioned. Carey re-released the song commercially in Japan in 2000, with a new remix known as the So So Def remix. The remix contains new vocals and is played over a harder, more urban beat that contains a sample of Afrika Bambaataa & the Soulsonic Force's \"Planet Rock;\" it features guest vocals by Jermaine Dupri and Bow Wow. The remix appears on Carey's compilation album \"Greatest Hits\" (2001) as a bonus track. A video was created for the So So Def remix, but it does not feature Carey or the hip-hop musicians that perform in the song. Instead, the video is animated and based on a scene in the video from Carey's \"Heartbreaker\" (1999). It features cartoon cameo appearances by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Bow Wow, Luis Miguel (Carey's boyfriend at the time), Carey's dog Jack, and Santa Claus. In 2009 and 2010, the song was included in a music video accompanying ESPN's (and their sister station, ABC) Christmas Day coverage of the NBA.\n\nIn 2009, a remix produced by Carey and Low Sunday, called \"Mariah's New Dance Mix\", was released. The mix laid the original 1994 vocals over new electronic instrumentation. The remix garnered a positive response. MTV's Kyle Anderson wrote that \"it's difficult to improve perfection,\" but that the remix \"does dress up the song in a disco thump that should make your office Christmas party 28 percent funkier than it was last year.\" Idolator's Becky Bain praised the song's catchiness.\n\nIn 2010, Carey re-recorded the song for her thirteenth studio and second holiday album, \"Merry Christmas II You\". Titled \"All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)\", the new version featured re-recorded vocals, softer bell ringing and stronger drumming, and an orchestral introduction that replaced the slow vocal introduction. Steven J. Horowitz from \"Rap-Up\" wrote that the new version \"sound[ed] just as enjoyable as it did in 1994.\" While the song was praised, it drew criticism for being too similar to the original. Thomas Connor from the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote that the new version \"just seems to add a few brassy backup singers to exactly the same arrangement.\" Caryn Ganz from \"Rolling Stone\" agreed, writing that it was \"hard to figure out what's 'extra festive'\" about the new version. Dan Hancox, editor of \"The National\", also felt the new version was unnecessary.\n\nCarey has performed the song during concerts as well as live televised performances. It was part of the setlist of several of her concert tours, including the Japanese shows of Carey's Daydream World Tour (1996), Butterfly World Tour (1998), Rainbow World Tour (2000), (2002–03), and The Adventures of Mimi Tour (2006).\n\nThe first performance of the song was at Cathedral of St. John the Divine, in December 8, 1994. Additionally, Carey performed the song at the 2004 Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade, which aired on ABC. Carey sang the So So Def remix version at the opening night of her Angels Advocate Tour on New Year's Eve. On November 9, 2010, Carey taped a live Christmas Special featuring the song, which aired on December 13, 2010, on ABC. Additionally, Carey performed the song alongside \"Oh Santa!\" airing on ESPN and ABC throughout the day on Christmas Day of 2010. On December 3, 2010, she performed both songs at the Walt Disney World Resort theme park, Magic Kingdom, in a performance that was taped and aired part of the Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade on ABC. She performed them again in a music video promoting the day's NBA games that aired on both networks. Carey also included the track as the encore to her sold out, annual Christmas concert series at the Beacon Theater in New York City. The show is entitled All I Want For Christmas Is You, A Night of Joy & Festivity. During \"The Late Late Show\" with James Corden on December 15, 2016, Mariah Carey sang this song on the popular feature Carpool Karaoke. Fellow singers Adele, Lady Gaga, Demi Lovato, Nick Jonas, Elton John, Selena Gomez, Gwen Stefani, Chris Martin and the band Red Hot Chili Peppers were featured in the video. It quickly went viral, achieving over 2 million views in less than 24 hours, and 25 million views in less than three weeks. In December 2019, Carey returned to \"The Late Late Show\" to perform the song for its 25th anniversary. In addition to this, she performed \"Oh Santa!\" and \"Christmas Time Is in the Air Again\".\n\nThere are four music videos for \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\". The first, primary video was shot in the style of a home movie using Super-8mm film; it was directed and filmed by Carey during the Christmas season of 1993. The video begins with Carey placing holiday ornaments on a Christmas tree and frolicking through the snowy mountainside. Outdoor scenes were shot at the Fairy Tale Forest in New Jersey, where Carey's then-husband Tommy Mottola made a cameo appearance as Santa Claus. It continues with scenes of Carey getting ready for her album cover photo shoot and spending time with her dog Jack. It concludes with Santa Claus leaving Carey with a bag of presents and waving goodbye. It has more than 633 million views on YouTube as of April 2020. In the song's alternate video, inspired by The Ronettes, Carey dances in a 1960s-influenced studio surrounded by go–go dancers. For a 1960s look, the video was filmed in black and white, with Carey in white boots and teased up hair. This video was also directed by Carey. There are two edits to this version of the video.\n\nIn 2019, along with the release of the deluxe 25th-anniversary edition of her album \"Merry Christmas\", she released two new music videos for the song. The first featured an unreleased footages of the first primary video. The second, directed by Joseph Kahn was a 'revamped' version entitled, 'Make My Wish Come True Edition' with new scenes of Carey in 2019.\n\nCarey released a children's book based on \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" on November 10, 2015, which went on to sell over 750,000 copies. She later released an animated family film called \"Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas Is You\", based on the book and song on November 14, 2017.\n\nOn March 21, 2017, Carey announced via her Twitter account that a film based on \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" was in development. A musical film based on \"Merry Christmas\", the plot revolves around a small town—perhaps not unlike Carey's hometown of Huntington, New York—where a ruthless developer wants to turn the land into a large shopping plaza. \"Mariah doesn't want to let that happen,\" says her producing partner Benny Medina. \"Her character uses song and love to keep the Christmas spirit alive.\" According to Carey, the script will be written by \"High School Musical\" writer Peter Barsocchini, but is still in its early stages of production. However, Carey gave \"Daily News\" a few more details regarding the project, saying, \"Since I recorded the Christmas album, I've always wanted to make a movie to go with it, something that people could watch and hear and enjoy every year. I'm into it. I'm all about the holiday season.\"\n\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" has charted every holiday season since its original release. In December 2017, the song reached number nine on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, making it the first holiday song to enter Hot 100's top ten since Kenny G's cover of \"Auld Lang Syne\" in January 2000. It became Carey's 28th top ten single in the Hot 100. In December 2018, the song became the second holiday song in the 60-year history of the Hot 100 to reach the top five when it reached number three, with only The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late) by David Seville and The Chipmunks having a higher rank (peaking at number one for four weeks in 1958–1959). In December 2019, the song became Carey's 19th number one hit. With global sales of over 16 million copies, the song remains Carey's biggest international success and the 11th best selling single of all time. As of 2017, the song was reported to have earned $60 million in royalties.\n\nIn 2010 \"The Daily Telegraph\" named \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" the most popular and most played Christmas song of the decade in the United Kingdom; by 2015 \"Fairytale of New York\" had become the UK’s most-played Christmas song of the 21st century. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list, calling it a \"holiday standard.\" In a UK-wide poll in December 2012, it was voted fifth on the ITV television special \"The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song\". Due to the song's lasting impact, Carey was dubbed the \"Queen of Christmas\", a title she is hesitant to accept. \"I don't accept that name because I feel like it's [too much],\" she said. \"I humbly thank them and I do have an extraordinary love for the holiday season, and it is the best time of the year.\"\n\nOn November 24, 2019, the song won three records in \"Guinness World Records\" for one of the best-selling and most recognizable Christmas songs, most streamed song on Spotify in 24 hours (female) (10,819,009 streams in December 2018) and most weeks in the UK singles Top 10 chart for a Christmas song (20) titles.\n\nAll I Want for Christmas Is You (SuperFestive!) is a duet between Carey and Canadian singer Justin Bieber. The song was recorded on his holiday album, \"Under the Mistletoe\", and released as a radio airplay only single in Italy on December 9, 2011, as the second single from the album. The music video for the duet featuring Bieber was filmed in Macy's department store in New York City, and features Bieber shopping with his friends whilst Carey is seen singing in the background. In December 2019, Carey released a new music video for the track to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the song.\n\n\nWorks cited\n"}

His third rock concept album, Wakeman based it on King Arthur and various figures and stories associated with the legend, including Guinevere, Lancelot, and Merlin. He started to write music for it while recovering from a heart attack in 1974 and recorded it with his five-piece band, the English Rock Ensemble, the New World Orchestra, and the English Chamber Choir.\n\n\"King Arthur\" received mostly positive reviews, though some labelled it a symbol of progressive rock excess. It reached No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 21 on the US \"Billboard\" 200. It was certified gold in the US, Brazil, Japan, and Australia. The album was promoted with a world tour in 1975 that included three shows at Wembley Arena performed as an ice show, the last time it was performed in its entirety until 2016. The album was reissued in 2015 with a Quadrophonic mix, and re-recorded in 2016 with additional parts previously removed from the original score due to time constraints.\n\nIn July 1974, the 25-year-old Wakeman headlined the Crystal Palace Garden Party VII concert held at Crystal Palace Park in London, with his rock band, a symphony orchestra, and choir. He had left the progressive rock band Yes two months prior over differences surrounding their creative direction and continued with his solo career, which had reached newfound success after his second album \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\" (1974) had become the first from A&M Records to chart at number one. Despite the success, Wakeman's health deteriorated during the preparations for the Crystal Palace show. The stress of putting it together resulted in Wakeman going without sleep in the five days prior to the event, and he cracked some bones in his wrist after he fell over in a pub. Wakeman got through the gig after he received three injections, one of morphine, before he went on stage. Coupled with his frequent smoking and heavy drinking, the situation culminated in Wakeman having three minor heart attacks several days after.\n\nDuring his recovery at Wexham Park Hospital in Berkshire, Wakeman's management paid a visit where a specialist advised them that Wakeman cease all performing and retire, but Wakeman ignored it and began to write material for his next studio album later that evening, one based on the legend of King Arthur and the people and stories based around it. During his youth Wakeman had stayed on a farm in Trevalga, Cornwall, which is near Tintagel, for five months; the legendary site of Arthur's castle, and it had stuck with him since then. It is his third concept album following \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\" (1973) and \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\". The first piece Wakeman worked on was \"The Last Battle\", the finale to \"King Arthur\". Wakeman kept track of what he had written after he organised for someone to sneak in a cassette tape recorder into his hospital room and recorded his arrangements by humming them into the microphone. Before \"King Arthur\" was recorded, Wakeman underwent a concert tour of North America, his first full-scale tour as a solo artist, in September and October 1974. The tour featured his band, an orchestra and choir; such a production ultimately cost him around £125,000.\n\nUpon his return to England from his North American tour, Wakeman and his band retreated to Morgan Studios in Willesden, London to record \"King Arthur\" from 16 October 1974 to 10 January 1975. The line-up of Wakeman's band had changed by the time of recording, with Gary Pickford-Hopkins and Ashley Holt on lead vocals, Jeffrey Crampton on acoustic and electric guitars, Roger Newell on bass, Barney James on drums, and John Hodgson on percussion. They were joined by the New World Orchestra, an ensemble formed by musicians picked by David Katz that included members of the London Symphony Orchestra, conductor David Measham, the English Chamber Choir with choirmaster Guy Protheroe, and the Nottingham Festival Vocal Group. Before recording could begin, the band had to wait for their equipment to be transported from the US and repaired, after the roadies had damaged the flight cases carrying their instruments. Rehearsals then took place for around two and a half weeks. An early idea for the album had engineer Paul Tregurtha inform Wakeman that what he wanted was \"technically impossible\", partly due to the lack of available tracks on the recording machine to produce his desired final mix.\n\nWakeman encountered some difficulty with the songwriting as many of the stories described in the books gave different accounts. After reading eight books himself, he picked the details he found the most \"colourful\" which included taking a passage from a children's book on the subject. He settled on four widely known stories and two lesser known, and proceeded to adapt them to music and lyrics. Much of the album was based around the three swords based around the legend: the sword Arthur pulled out from the stone and anvil, the Excalibur which some believe was instead handed to Arthur by the Lady of the Lake, and the one associated to Galahad. Wakeman incorporated ideas from his personal life into the music, he said: \"It's as much about me as Arthur.\"\n\n\"Guinevere\" was a song that Wakeman had arranged six years prior to recording the album. Wakeman wrote violin arrangements for \"Sir Lancelot and the Black Knight\" that were so fast for the players, biographer Dan Wooding wrote they \"collapsed with laughter\" upon viewing the score. After some false starts, they played the music correctly after Wakeman instructed them they play twice as fast as he originally wanted. \"I thought I'd teach the ones who were cocky a lesson\". \"Merlin the Magician\" is in three parts; Wakeman had read several descriptions of the character and conjured the image of \"a little old man preparing his potions\", so he therefore introduces the song with a quiet theme. One book depicted Merlin working in the basement of a castle, \"surrounded by bottles and liquids like a mad professor\", which inspired the heavier second theme. The piano and banjo section arose from a story that involved Merlin falling in love and chasing after a young girl, who eventually shuts him in a cave where he dies.\n\n\"King Arthur\" was released on 27 March 1975. the album peaked at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart and number 21 on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the United States. \"King Arthur\" became Wakeman's third consecutive gold album to be certified by the Recording Industry Association of America, and was also certified gold in Brazil, Japan and Australia. The album has sold 12 million copies in total.\n\n\"Arthur\" has been used by the BBC as the theme to its election night coverage from 1979 to 1997, and 2005, with the track returning for the corporation's 2019 United Kingdom general election coverage. It was also used on Cuban television Channel 6 for years, without crediting or paying royalties.\n\nWakeman supported the album with a world tour that lasted from May to December 1975, including concerts performed across the United States and sell out shows in Brazil. The latter leg saw Wakeman perform with the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra in shows organised by the Brazilian government and attended by what Wooding estimated as around 500,000 in total. During his stop in Rio de Janeiro, Wakeman met Ronnie Biggs, one of the participants of the 1963 Great Train Robbery, who received tickets to the show and gave Wakeman the shirt he wore during the robbery.\n\nWakeman wanted a unique show for \"King Arthur\" in England, his first UK shows since Crystal Palace, rather than a standard concert performance. An early idea of his was to perform the album at Tintagel Castle as part of a King Arthur Day event with a medieval pageant and jousting knights. Wakeman was informed the castle was unsuitable for concerts, so he suggested to his promoter, Harvey Goldsmith, the idea of staging the show in a field beside it with a large inflatable castle. After travelling to Tintagel to investigate the possibility, Goldsmith found the land was crown property and a series of letters to the Duchy of Cornwall about the show failed to generate a response. A show at Tintagel was abandoned, and Wakeman suggested Wembley Stadium but Goldsmith explained it was not feasible. The keyboardist suggested Wembley Arena, but booking the venue caused a problem as the Ice Follies were scheduled to perform afterwards and the arena had already become an ice rink. Goldsmith and Wakeman's management instead suggested a scaled down show at the Royal Albert Hall, but Wakeman insisted on Wembley, and subsequently told a \"Melody Maker\" reporter that he would be presenting \"King Arthur\" as an ice show, \"so there was no going back\".\n\n\"King Arthur\" was performed for three sell out nights from 30–31 May and 1 June that were attended by 27,000 people in total. Wakeman funded the production with his own money which included his band the English Rock Ensemble, an orchestra and choir playing in the round, a narrator, and 19 international ice skaters who reenacted the scenes in costume. A sound system by Clair Brothers had to be shipped in from the US as there was not a system in England suitable for the event. Though the shows sold out and raised publicity for the album, they ultimately lost money. The original plan was to hold three evening shows with a matinee on 31 May which would have helped bring the production to a small profit, but it was cancelled. One show was filmed and broadcast on television. The production was ranked No. 79 on the list of 100 Greatest Shocking Moments in Rock and Roll compiled by VH1. In 2014, Wakeman expressed a wish to stage \"King Arthur\" on ice once again at The O2 Arena.\n\nIn 2012, Wakeman released a rerecorded version of \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\" with additional pieces that were originally removed from the arrangement due to the limited time available on a vinyl record. He was booked to perform the extended album in Argentina that year, but the promoter also wished for a show with an extended version of \"King Arthur\". Wakeman proceeded to work on new songs for the special occasion that were based on Morgan le Fay, Elaine, Camelot, Percival, and the Holy Grail. However, the promoter later asked for \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\" instead and the new material remained unfinished. The idea resurfaced in 2015 when Stuart Galbraith, promoter of Wakeman's 2014 \"Journey\" tour, suggested a similar re-recording for \"King Arthur\" and to have it performed at The O2 Arena as part of the 2016 Stone Free Festival. Wakeman accepted, and the concert became a catalyst for a new, 88-minute version to be arranged and recorded in time for it.\n\nThe project was Wakeman's first to be completed through online direct-to-fan support, as suggested by Steve Hammonds of Universal Records. Wakeman had approached the label about the original album put out with the new songs added in, yet Hammonds wanted everything to be re-recorded and noted the label was too short on time to have it put down and placed it in their release schedule. Knowing the project would become expensive, Hammonds advised Wakeman to set up a fund on PledgeMusic to allow fans to donate towards its cost. The 90-day fund launched on 9 February 2016 with donation incentives to receive exclusive merchandise, deluxe album packages, attend recording sessions, and receive an executive producer credit. Wakeman was pleased with the pledge system and felt encouraged to deliver a good product from reading fan comments and messages. The fund ended with 140% of its target met and 2,891 individual pledgers.\n\nThe re-recording was produced at Angel Recording Studios in northern London with the English Chamber Choir, Wakeman's English Rock Ensemble, conductor Guy Protheroe, and Ann Manly assisting Protheroe with the orchestral scores. Narration was provided by actor Ian Lavender. Wakeman was often asked whether \"Merlin the Magician\" was to be kept an instrumental track; he decided to incorporate a version with lyrics. Sections of the horn arrangements were recorded many times to acquire the best sound and cut. The piano parts were recorded in several days at The Old Granary in Norfolk which has a Steinway grand piano, Wakeman's favourite model of the instrument. Roger Dean was commissioned to design its new artwork. It was released on 19 June 2016 by PledgeMusic/Gonzo Entertainment, the day of the O2 Arena concert.\n\nAll tracks and lyrics by Rick Wakeman.\n\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\nMusicians\n\nProduction\nCredits are adapted from the liner notes.\n\nThe English Rock Ensemble\n\nPersonnel\n"}

After moving to Brooklyn in the early 1950s, she was taken in by Lee Drinkard Warrick of The Drinkard Singers.\n\nFrom the age of 14, she became a regular performer with the family gospel group, which had originally been formed in Savannah, Georgia around 1938, and which also at times included Lee Warrick's sister, Emily (later known as Cissy Houston), and daughters Dionne and Delia (later better known as Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick).\n\nShe made her recording debut with the Drinkard Singers – who later became better known as The Sweet Inspirations – on their 1954 album, \"The Newport Spiritual Stars\". She left the Drinkard Singers in 1960 and made her first solo recording, \"More Than You Know\", on Ember Records. This was followed by further singles on Lavette and Scepter Records, but with little commercial success, although \"You Busted My Mind\" later became successful on the UK's Northern soul nightclub circuit.\n\nIn 1967, Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records teamed her up with white singer-songwriter Billy Vera to make the United States' first racially integrated duo, and The Sweet Inspirations, to record \"Storybook Children\". The record made No. 20 on the US R&B chart and No. 54 pop. It was seen as the first interracial duo recording for a major label\n\nHowever, Vera has stated that television executives denied them appearances together, believing (wrongly) that Vera and Clay were more than just singing partners, and, to add insult to injury, had the song performed on network TV by Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood. Judy was pregnant, at the time, with her first child by her husband, jazz drummer Leo Gatewood.\n\nAfter another hit duet with Vera, \"Country Girl, City Man\", which reached No. 41 R&B and No. 36 pop, and an album together, she returned to Stax Records. There she had further successes, this time with William Bell. Their recording of \"Private Number\" reached No. 17 in the R&B chart and No. 75 on the U.S. pop chart, and had greater success in the UK where it reached No. 8 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nA follow-up, \"My Baby Specializes\", also made the R&B chart, before she returned to Atlantic for one more record with Vera, \"Reaching for the Moon\" and a final solo hit \"Greatest Love\" (# 45 R&B in 1970).\n\nSubsequently, she worked as a backing vocalist with Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Van Morrison, Donny Hathaway and Wilson Pickett. Stricken with a brain tumor in 1979, she returned to gospel music shortly after her recovery, and sang occasionally with Cissy Houston's gospel choir in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nAfter being involved in a car accident, she died a few weeks later of complications. She was 62 years old. She was survived by two sons, Todd and Leo Gatewood, a brother, Raymond Guions, and her sister, Mrs. Sylvia Shemwell.\n\n"}

{"id": "1823028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1823028", "title": "Krusty Krab", "text": "Krusty Krab\n\nThe Krusty Krab is a fictional fast food restaurant in the American animated television series \"SpongeBob SquarePants\". It is famous for its signature burger, the Krabby Patty, the formula to which is a closely guarded trade secret.\n\nThe restaurant was founded by Eugene H. Krabs (Mr. Krabs), who is also the owner and manager. It has two full-time employees: SpongeBob SquarePants, who works as the fry cook; and Squidward Tentacles, who works as the cashier. The Krusty Krab is deemed \"the finest eating establishment ever established for eating\" in Bikini Bottom, and it is constantly challenged by its primary competitor, the Chum Bucket, which is operated by Mr. Krabs' nemesis and former best friend, Plankton.\n\nOne of the main settings of the series, the Krusty Krab was introduced in the pilot episode, \"Help Wanted\", where SpongeBob applies for the fry cook job at the restaurant. The Krusty Krab has also been featured in other media, including a theatrical film series, a Broadway musical, video games, and toys. The restaurant has been referenced or parodied throughout popular culture. It has also inspired real-life establishments.\n\nThe Krusty Krab is a prominent fast food restaurant in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. It is owned and operated by Eugene H. Krabs (Mr. Krabs), who invented its famous Krabby Patty sandwich. Mr. Krabs has two employees: Squidward Tentacles and SpongeBob SquarePants, who work as the cashier and fry cook, respectively. Patrick Star has also worked at the Krusty Krab for several brief stints in a variety of positions.\n\nLocated across the street from the Krusty Krab is the Chum Bucket, another fast food restaurant owned and operated by Plankton and Karen. Plankton, Mr. Krabs' former best friend, later became his arch-competitor; Plankton's futile attempts at stealing the secret Krabby Patty recipe to replicate the burgers and put the Krusty Krab out of business is a major plot point throughout the series.\n\nThe Krusty Krab usually attracts customers from Bikini Bottom because of the Krabby Patty's renowned taste and the fact that Plankton's restaurant has a menu consisting of chum (bait consisting of fish parts), which is considered mostly inedible by the other characters. As a result, the Krusty Krab has become one of the most successful restaurants in the city. In the show, SpongeBob calls it \"the finest eating establishment ever established for eating\". Mr. Krabs frequently exploits his restaurant's popularity, such as engaging in price gouging and charging his own employees for use of the building's services.\n\nIn one episode, the Krusty Krab building is shown to have originally been a run-down retirement home called the Rusty Krab, which Mr. Krabs acquired and converted into a restaurant. In another episode, the restaurant was also the name of a pirate ship owned by Mr. Krabs before he started the business. The restaurant has seen a lot of temporary changes throughout the show, such as operating 24/7 and being transformed into a hotel, which have been the focus of many episodes. Other episodes have depicted the Krusty Krab being damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe Krusty Krab's menu, the Galley Grub, consists mostly of ordinary fast food items, such as french fries and sodas. Its signature sandwich, the Krabby Patty, is celebrated, to a comic degree, by the citizens of Bikini Bottom. In \"\", Mr. Krabs states: \"The Krabby Patty is what ties us all together! Without it, there will be a complete breakdown of social order!\" The sandwich comprises two buns, with the patty, lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, and pickles between them (in that order). The recipe of the patty is a closely guarded trade secret, which have led viewers to speculate about its contents. Several fan theories have been formed to guess the secret ingredient.\n\nAccording to animator Vincent Waller, \"there is absolutely no meat in the Krabby Patty. There's no animal product in there\", something which was always planned by series creator Stephen Hillenburg. Mr. Lawrence, a show writer and Plankton's voice actor, explained that the show's writers are not allowed to depict fish as food; he stated that there is no meat served in Bikini Bottom except at the Chum Bucket. Tom Kenny, the voice actor for SpongeBob, joked: \"Krabby Patties are hummus!\" Some commentators suggest that there is actually no secret ingredient, pointing to Mr. Krabs' miserliness. A writer for Hollywood.com believes that it is \"all a ruse that crafty Mr. Krabs came up with in order to stop Plankton from focusing on [t]he Chum Bucket. It's legitimately brilliant marketing!\" On the possibility that the secret Krabby Patty formula will be revealed in future episodes, Waller said in 2017 that he \"would not count on it\". In 2019, Waller stated that Hillenburg is the only person to have seen it.\n\nAlong with SpongeBob's pineapple house, the Krusty Krab was originally intended to be where \"the show would return to again and again, and in which most of the action would take place\". It debuted in \"Help Wanted\", the series premiere, and has since appeared in more than 80% of episodes .\n\nThe Krusty Krab was inspired by series creator Stephen Hillenburg's time as a fry cook and lobster boiler at a fast-food seafood restaurant during several summers after finishing high school. SpongeBob's occupation was directly based on this experience, while Mr. Krabs was inspired by Hillenburg's manager at the restaurant. However, the restaurant owner was not greedy; Hillenburg added this detail to \"give him more personality\".\n\nWhen Hillenburg first created Mr. Krabs, his surname was spelled Crabs, and the name of the restaurant was the Crusty Crab. Hillenburg changed the spelling shortly before production began on the show's pilot episode, deciding that K's were funnier and more memorable. He based the building's design on a lobster trap.\n\nThe restaurant was featured in the 2004 theatrical film \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\" and its (where the secret Krabby Patty formula was a major plot device). It has been adapted to Broadway. The Krusty Krab and the Krabby Patty have been referenced or parodied throughout popular culture. In \"Major League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\", an episode of the sketch comedy \"Robot Chicken\", a segment features Mr. Krabs using crab legs as the secret ingredient for Krabby Patties. Online, the Krusty Krab–Chum Bucket rivalry has been turned into memes.\n\nThe Krusty Krab has been included in many \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" toys, publications, and other merchandise. The Lego Group has released two Lego construction sets modeled after the Krusty Krab building. The Krusty Krab has also appeared in \"SpongeBob\"-related video games, such as \"\", the title of which alludes to the restaurant. Viacom, which owns Nickelodeon, has earned millions of dollars on licensed products bearing the Krusty Krab name, mainly aquarium figurines and children's play sets.\n\nThe Krusty Krab has been recognized by numerous publications—including BuzzFeed, the New York \"Daily News\", \"Screen Rant\", and food website \"The Daily Meal\"—as a restaurant they wished were real. Similarly, as stated in Boston.com, \"Sure, we can get crab cakes, but we wish we could try the Krusty Krab's signature sandwich, the Krabby Patties. If only we could get a suit like Sandy's and journey to Bikini Bottom\". In another list published by \"The Daily Meal\", the Krusty Krab was voted number one of \"all the fictional spots currently on TV that our readers wished they could dine at\". In 2016, \"Time\" magazine listed the Krusty Krab as one of the 18 most influential fictional companies.\n\nThe Krusty Krab has inspired several real-life establishments unaffiliated with Nickelodeon or its parent company, Viacom. In Santa Elena, Costa Rica, a restaurant called the Krusty Krab opened in 2012 but closed a year later. In Ramallah, Palestine, a company called Salta Burgers constructed a real-life Krusty Krab, which received online attention. It opened on July24, 2014, serving seafood and its own version of the Krabby Patty; , the restaurant is still in operation. Some commentators, like in the \"Houston Press\" noted of these foreign imitations that \"The long arm of U.S. trademark law doesn't reach across international waters. Every country has its own filing process that must be followed\". In Moscow, a Krusty Krab-themed restaurant called The Krusty Krab Cafe opened in 2016 and also makes unofficial Krabby Patties. In Davao City, Philippines, a coffee shop opened in 2017 and sells Krabby Patty-inspired sandwiches; it was named KrustyKrub Cafe because the son of its husband-and-wife owners is a fan of the show.\n\nIn January 2016, Viacom sued IJR Capital Investments after learning that it had applied to trademark the Krusty Krab name at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in December 2014. The latter was planning to open two restaurants adopting the moniker in Houston and Los Angeles. In the lawsuit, Viacom claimed that the proposed restaurants would be an infringement, even though Viacom had not filed a formal trademark for the Krusty Krab name. IJR owner, Javier Ramos Jr. claimed he thought of the name, referring to \"the crust that sticks to the top of crabs when they are put in a seafood boil\". He claimed not to have heard of the Krusty Krab in \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", and that he chose it after checking Google and finding no restaurants using that name. While the USPTO approved IJR's trademark application, a Texas federal judge ruled in January 2017 that IJR violated Viacom's rights to the \"SpongeBob\" property, citing \"ownership of a trademark is established by use, not by registration\". The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decided in May 2018 that Viacom deserves trademark protection for the Krusty Krab, and that IJR cannot use it.\n\nIn celebration of the 20th anniversary of \"SpongeBob\", Nickelodeon recreated the Krusty Krab building at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con. Inside, attendees could play an interactive game in which they must complete food orders before running out of time. It was part of Nickelodeon's booth at the event, which was dedicated to the show. It featured real-life replicas of Mrs. Puff's Boating School and the Chum Bucket, which stood tall and allowed attendees to buy collectibles and have autographs from the show's cast members. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that the Bikini Bottom setup \"drew hundreds of nostalgic fans\" on the first day of the convention. \"Adweek\" named it among its ten \"Favorite TV-Themed Activations at Comic-Con 2019\".\n\n"}

In a 2001 Channel 4 poll, Kevin was ranked 15th on their list of the 100 greatest TV characters.\n\nKevin originated in 1990 in the \"Little Brother\" sketches of \"Harry Enfield's Television Programme\" as an annoyingly energetic boy who constantly vexed his older brother with his irritating catchphrases and habit of bursting into his room when he was with a girl.\n\nIn the first episode of \"Harry Enfield and Chums\" (the new name for the show, in November 1994), Kevin, who despite the same name and similar initial manner was actually separate from the earlier character, reached his thirteenth birthday. The sketch showed his parents watching in horror as Kevin lost his sense of dress, courtesy and posture as the clock struck midnight on the day of his thirteenth birthday, thus becoming Kevin the Teenager, one of the most memorable of Enfield's comic creations. Unlike the previous sketches which included an older brother, this incarnation of Kevin was an only child.\n\nAs a teenager, wearing a baseball cap the wrong way round and with his red hair flopping over his face, Kevin is rude to his despairing parents, frequently shouting \"I hate you, I wish I'd never been born!\" at them, and insisting that everything is \"so unfair!\" In one sketch, when his father asks him to wash his car, Kevin ends up taking the entire day to complete the task due to his inability to get out of bed before noon and an apparent allergy to work, and in another sketch, though wide awake, he made the most primitive of attempts at tidying his room when required to do so. The character is also heavily dictated by peer pressure, and was seen in various other sketches trying to sound like Ali G, or Liam Gallagher.\n\nHis best friend is another teenaged boy named Perry Carter (played by the actress Kathy Burke, and based on an early character Burke portrayed on various Channel 4 shows). They starred in a 2000 feature film, \"Kevin & Perry Go Large\".\n\nThe sketches suggest that teenage boys are always very polite to all parents except their own. Kevin and Perry heap immense amounts of abuse on their own respective parents (though Perry shouts at his down the phone rather than face to face) yet are very polite to each other's parents. In one sketch, Kevin's plans to host a party go wrong and ends with the house being trashed. Despite his frequent declarations of hatred towards his parents, Kevin ends up crying whilst his long-suffering mother gives him a much-needed hug.\n\nAside from playing video games, Kevin's one aim in life is to lose his virginity, or at least to prove that he has a girlfriend. From boasting about the (imagined) joys of sex to placing the nozzle of a vacuum cleaner to his neck to look as though he has received a love bite, he is determined to prove that he has \"done it\". He eventually does lose his virginity during a drunken party in the final episode of \"Harry Enfield and Chums\". The following morning, he wakes up transformed into a nice, polite and helpful young man. This is however later revealed to be a dream by his mother in the first of the two Christmas specials, with Kevin still behaving as before. Kevin and Perry both eventually lose their virginities in Ibiza in the movie Kevin & Perry Go Large\".\n\nThe term \"Kevin the Teenager\" (often shortened to simply \"Kevin\"), has entered British vernacular to describe any adolescent who is bad-tempered or rebellious (\"He's a right Kevin!\"). It can even be applied to female adolescents.\n\nEarly in his career Andy Murray was sometimes called Kevin the Teenager due to his bad-tempered on-court demeanour.\n\nKevin's father (named Dave in one of the earlier sketches, and later Frank (though others argue 'Rick' or 'Ray' is his name in the movie, based on the sex video played by Eyeball Paul in the movie, where Kevin's mother says \"Ooh Rick\" during Kevin and Perry's mix, and also afterwards when the two are lying in bed, mortified, and Kevin's mother says \"Oh, Ray..\") has been played by three actors:\n\nWhen Kevin was \"Little Brother\", his father was played by Martyn Whitby and his mother was played by Caroline Quentin.\n\nKevin's mother (named Sheila in one of the earlier sketches), in contrast to Kevin's father, was played by Louisa Rix in both the series and the movie.\n"}

It was the first single released from the album and is arguably one of Europe's most recognizable and popular songs. The song was released in Europe, Australia and New Zealand in July 1988. The song reached number one in Norway and their homeland Sweden and peaked at number 9 on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks. The single charted in many other European charts as well.\n\n\"Open Your Heart\" and \"Let the Good Times Rock\" would become minor hits in the UK. Three more singles would be released, yet none of them charted. \"Sign of the Times\" was released as single only in Argentina in 1988 and \"Tomorrow\" only in Brazil in 1989.\n\n\"Out of This World\" was the band's follow up album to the successful album \"The Final Countdown\", but it did not match the success of its predecessor. Upon its release in August 1988, \"Out of This World\" peaked at No. 19 on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart. The album is Europe's best-selling album in Switzerland. \"Out of This World\" achieved Platinum status in the United States, platinum status in Switzerland and gold in Canada.\n\n\"Out of This World\" included the hit singles \"Superstitious\", \"Open Your Heart\" and \"Let the Good Times Rock\", all of which had accompanying music videos. \"Superstitious\" was released in the fall of 1988 and became arguably the band's most recognizable song from the album. Its music video received heavy airplay on music television.\n\nReviewing the album, AllMusic contributor Andy Hinds writes that \"Europe produces made-to-order lite metal with admirable craftsmanship and occasionally memorable hooks. \"Superstitious\" even has a disarming gospel quality. This is hard rock with all the edges sanded off. Capable lead singer Joey Tempest carries the tunes with nonthreatening panache, while Kee Marcello (who proved his virtuosity on Europe's previous by performing \"Flight of the Bumblebee\") provides plenty of nice guitar solos.\" Paul Elliott of \"Classic Rock\" considers \"Out of This World\" \"the strongest\" of the two follow-up albums to the highly successful \"The Final Countdown\" and \"Superstitious\" \"arguably Europe's greatest ever song\". Tim Jones of \"Record Collector\" is even more enthusiastic, defining the album \"a stratospheric set of a dozen imperious rockers.\" On the contrary, Canadian journalist Martin Popoff wrote a bad review of the album, comparing it to \"an offensive pop rock outing, much closer to early Warrant ... than \"The Final Countdown\" could or would dare\" and calling Europe \"a dunce-cap posse solidly in search of cash and chicks, egregiously removed from any sort of hard rock acumen.\"\n\nPrior to the release of the album, in the summer of 1988, the band travelled the U.S. together with Def Leppard. However, the band's management considered a promotional tour of Europe (the continent) more important and made the band withdraw from the highly successful American tour. It has been reported that manager Thomas Erdtman made the decision as he did not want to share more US revenues with American manager Herbie Herbert as this was agreed in a contract.\n\nAfter the promotional tour was over, the band set on rehearsing for the upcoming Out Of This World Tour, which began with a bombastic show (60,000 visitors) in Mumbai, India in November 1988. Then the band flew to Japan, where they filmed the video for \"Let the Good Times Rock\". The scheduled tour of Australia was, however, unexpectedly cancelled. From January to April 1989, the band toured all over Europe. In some places, in Germany particularly, the band did not manage to fill up the arenas and concert halls like they had done during the Final Countdown Tour, despite more and more good reviews from the musical press. In May 1989 the band was supposed to go over to the USA again. But the album sales were not as high as had been expected. So in the end, there was no U.S. tour and the only concert the band played in the summer of 1989 was the legendary festival in Milton Keynes (UK). After that, the band decided to move to Los Angeles and compose new songs for the next album.\n\nInterviews with the band from before and around the album's release indicate that a title track and a cover song were recorded but not included. Kee Marcello claims in his biography \"The Rock Star that God Forgot\" to have written a number of complete songs that were rejected for this album - \"Too Far Gone\", \"Another World\" and \"Can't Fake Love\" are listed. He also clarifies that the \"cover song\" was in fact a Diane Warren demo called \"Look Away\", a Billboard No. 1 hit for the band Chicago in December 1988.\n\n\n\n"}

Hill played with the Toronto Blue Jays (1989–91), Cleveland Indians (1991–93), Chicago Cubs (1993–94, 1998–2000), San Francisco Giants (1995–97), Seattle Mariners (1998), New York Yankees (2000), and Anaheim Angels (2001) during his thirteen-year career. With the Yankees, he won the 2000 World Series over the New York Mets. Hill batted and threw right-handed. Hill was also infamous for his defensive escapades, which were once described by then-Mariners pitching coach Bryan Price as \"akin to watching a gaffed haddock surface for air.\"\n\nHill graduated from Santa Cruz High School in 1983, and was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1983 amateur draft, in the ninth round and 219th overall.\n\nHill made his major league debut on July 31, 1989, with the Toronto Blue Jays. He collected his first Major League hit, and RBI single, off of Andy Hawkins. In 19 games that year, he collected 15 hits including his first career home run and seven runs batted in. His play that season allowed him to remain with the team for the 1990 season, where he hit .231 over 84 games including 12 home runs and 32 runs batted in. In 1991, he played in 35 games for the Blue Jays compiling a .253 average. On June 27, 1991 Hill was traded to the Cleveland Indians.\n\nHill played in 37 games for the Indians in 1991 collected 32 hits while driving in 14 runs. In his first and only full season in Cleveland in 1992, Hill played in 102 games collecting 18 home runs and 49 runs batted in (then career-highs). Hill played in 66 games for the Indians in 1993 and hit only .224 before being traded to the Cubs on August 19. While a member of the Cleveland Indians, he committed a \"phantom steal\" of second. This occurred during a game against the Detroit Tigers which was interrupted by a prolonged disturbance in the outfield. When play resumed, no one noticed that Hill had moved from first to second, thus giving him a stolen base.\n\nHill played in 31 games for the Cubs in his first season hitting .345 while driving in 22 runs. In 1994, Hill played in 89 games and clubbed 10 home runs while collecting 38 runs batted in before the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike cancelled the remainder of the season. On April 7, 1995 he was granted free agency.\n\nHill signed with the Giants on April 9, 1995 where he hit .264 with 24 home runs and 86 runs batted in along with a career-high 25 stolen bases. The following year, he played in 98 games hitting .280 with 19 homers and 67 runs batted in. In 1997, he hit .261 with 11 home runs and 64 runs batted in. Hill was the first National League player to serve as a designated hitter in regular season play, doing so on June 12, 1997 in the first-ever game in interleague play as his San Francisco Giants faced the Texas Rangers at The Ballpark at Arlington. That year, he played in his first postseason game against the Marlins. He went 0 for 7 with two walks. Following the Giants defeat, Hill was granted free agency on October 29.\n\nAs Hill grew up near San Francisco, during his stint with the San Francisco Giants he often reached out to the community in which he grew up, making numerous public appearances and autograph signings.\n\nHill signed with the Mariners on January 8, 1998 and hit .290 with 12 homers and 33 runs batted in before being placed on waivers and claimed by the Cubs.\n\nHill was selected off waivers by the Cubs on July 6, 1998. In 48 games Hill hit .351 with 8 homers and 23 runs batted in. Hill also played in one game during the 1998 National League Division Series where he was one for three with a run batted in and a stolen base. He was granted free agency on October 23, but re-signed with the Cubs on December 7. Hill hit .300 with 20 home runs and 55 runs batted in during the 1999 season. He played in 64 games in 2000 and hit .262 with 11 home runs. On May 11, 2000, Hill became the first, and thus far only player to hit a home run on the five-story residential building across the street from Wrigley Field at 1032 W. Waveland Ave. The shot came off Steve Woodard in the second inning of the Cubs' 14-8 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. He was traded to the Yankees on July 23.\n\nHill played in 40 games for the Yankees, mostly as a designated hitter. He hit 16 home runs in a rotating designated hitter role and was added to the postseason roster. He played in four games in the 2000 American League Division Series against the Oakland A's and was 1 for 12 with 2 runs batted in. In the 2000 American League Championship Series against the Seattle Mariners, Hill played in two games and went 0 for 2, striking out in both of his plate appearances. In the 2000 World Series against the New York Mets, Hill played in three games going 0 for 3. He earned a World Series ring when the Yankees defeated the Mets in five games.\n\nOn March 28, 2001, Hill was traded to the Angels for minor-leaguer Darren Blakely. He appeared in only sixteen games that year, hitting .136 before being released on June 1. He retired after the season.\n\nIn a 13-year major league career, Hill compiled a lifetime batting average of .271, hitting 186 home runs and driving in 586 RBIs in 1,162 games. As a pinch hitter Hill had a .287 lifetime average with 13 home runs.\n\nIn 2003, he began coaching in the Colorado Rockies minor league system before being named first base coach following the 2006 season.\n\nIn 2007, Hill started wearing a helmet while coaching first base following the death of Tulsa Drillers (a Rockies minor-league affiliate) first base coach and former major leaguer Mike Coolbaugh from injuries sustained when hit in the head by a batted ball. Hill and Oakland's Rene Lachemann were the only coaches at the major league level to do so that year. Hill quickly became an advocate for all first base coaches to wear helmets. In 2007, Joe Garagiola, Jr. (then Vice President of Baseball Operations), adopted a rule requiring all professional baseball base coaches to wear helmets beginning in 2008.\n\nHill managed the Colorado Springs Sky Sox during the 2013 and 2014 seasons while the Sky Sox were the AAA affiliates of the Colorado Rockies. He was named the manager of the Albuquerque Isotopes on January 8, 2015, after the Colorado Rockies changed their AAA affiliation from Colorado Springs to Albuquerque Isotopes.\n\nIn December 2007, Hill was included in the Mitchell Report in which it was alleged that he had used performance-enhancing drugs during his career. In the report, Kirk Radomski alleged that he met Hill at a social function in 2000 during which they discussed Hill's dissatisfaction with the results from his use of HGH. Radomski claims he sent Hill a complimentary bottle of HGH, which Hill tried - then later expressed his satisfaction with the results. Radomski stated that Hill purchased two kits of HGH from him and provided a photocopy of a cancelled check from Hill for $3,200. Hill's phone number and address were also included in Radomski's address book.\n\nAs an employee of Major League Baseball, Hill was required to submit to an interview by the Mitchell investigators. During the interview, Hill denied having used the HGH provided by Radomski, citing that he had been suffering from marital stresses at the time. He stated that this had been a one-time purchase, and that he had never used performance-enhancing substances. He admitted that the drugs had stayed in his possession until 2007 when he discovered them while unpacking from a move. Hill claimed that he couldn't remember other players with whom he may have discussed steroid use, and noted that his lawyer had warned him that naming players would hurt his career.\n\nOn December 20, 2007 Hill was also named in Jason Grimsley's unsealed affidavit as a user of steroids. Hill and Grimsley were teammates on the 2000 New York Yankees.\n\nDuring his early career, Hill was forced to go on the disabled list after suffering injuries during a sleepwalking incident. Hill, an arachnophobe, had a nightmare about being attacked by spiders and in the process went sleepwalking to try to get away. When he woke up from the incident, he had cuts all over his hands and feet due to walking across shards of broken glass from a table he knocked over and also fell down a flight of stairs. His teammates began calling him \"Spiderman\" afterwards. \n\nIn 1995, he married Lori Hill (née Domhoff), daughter of noted sociologist G. William Domhoff. They have two children. His son, Glenallen Jr. was a 4th round pick of the Arizona Diamondbacks, in the 2019 MLB Draft.\n\n\n, or Retrosheet, or The Hardball Times, or Pelota Binaria (Venezuelan Winter League)\n"}

The album was organized by guitarist Danny Bland (of the bands Cat Butt, Best Kissers in the World, and the Dwarves), Eddie Spaghetti of the Supersuckers, and Scott Parker, who served as executive producers of the project.\n\nThe liner notes, written by Burk Sauls, assert that the conviction of Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelley Jr., and Jason Baldwinwas was a miscarriage of justice: \"There is no physical evidence against them. No witnesses. Nothing aside from coerced statements and the vague, incomplete testimony of children\", he wrote, stating that the three were limited by poverty to inexperienced public defenders and that \"everything about the trials was biased against them, but it didn't matter to the jury because Damien, Jason, and Jessie looked 'evil' to the locals. They were teenagers who liked the kind of music that's on this [album]. They wrote poetry and read Stephen King and Shakespeare and wore black concert T-shirts. That was enough for the judge and jury.\" The notes advertised the Justice Project's Campaign Against Wrongful Executions and directed readers to wm3.org, a website devoted to freeing Echols, Misskelley, and Baldwinwas.\n\nThe album includes fifteen tracks recorded exclusively for the compilation, eight of which are original compositions while the rest are cover versions.

{"id": "1823098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1823098", "title": "Dick Stuart", "text": "Dick Stuart\n\nRichard Lee Stuart (November 7, 1932 – December 15, 2002) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a first baseman from 1958 to 1966 then, played in the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league from 1967 to 1968 before returning to play one final season in Major League Baseball in 1969.\n\nA two-time All-Star player, Stuart was notable for being an integral member of the 1960 Pittsburgh Pirates team that upset the New York Yankees to win the 1960 World Series and, for being the 1963 American League RBI champion. Stuart threw and batted right-handed; during his playing days, he stood tall, weighing .\n\nStuart was born in San Francisco, California, but his family soon relocated to San Carlos and he attended Sequoia High School in neighboring Redwood City. Stuart declined two scholarships to play college baseball when he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates in June for a $10,000 bonus. The outfielder soon emerged as one of the top sluggers in their farm system. He batted .313, and clubbed a Pioneer League leading 31 home runs with the Billings Mustangs in . He also led the league in runs batted in (121), runs (115) and total bases (292).\n\nHis minor league career was interrupted by a stint in the United States Army in and . After initially sputtering upon his return to professional baseball in , Stuart set a Pioneer League record with 66 home runs in with the Lincoln Chiefs. Equally stunning was his league leading 171 strikeouts.\n\nHis fielding also proved to be something of a liability. The Pirates unsuccessfully tried him at third base with the Atlanta Crackers in before shifting him to first base in 1958. Stuart clubbed 31 home runs in 80 games for the Salt Lake City Bees when he received his call to the majors in July.\n\nStuart made his major league debut with the Pirates on July 10, 1958 at the age of 25. With the Pirates trailing by a 8-5 deficit, Stuart hit a two run home run in the ninth inning of his major league debut to bring his team within a run. The following day, he hit a grand slam off Moe Drabowsky to lead his team to a 7-2 victory over the Chicago Cubs. Over the remainder of the season, Stuart would bat .268 with 48 RBIs. Despite being called up halfway through the season, and being used in a lefty/righty platoon with Ted Kluszewski, Stuart's sixteen home runs was third best on the team. He also led the league in errors committed by a first baseman (16) for the first of seven consecutive years.\n\nHe was again in a platoon with Kluszewski in , and was batting .294 with nineteen home runs and sixty RBIs when the Pirates dealt Kluszewski to the Chicago White Sox on August 25. As the Pirates' full time first baseman, Stuart improved to .307 with eight home runs and nineteen RBIs. His 27 home runs and 78 RBIs led the team, while his .297 batting average tied for the team lead with catcher Smoky Burgess. His .976 fielding percentage was the lowest for a National League first baseman since Fred Luderus’ .975 in .\n\nFueled by an MVP season from shortstop Dick Groat, and the emergence of young star Roberto Clemente, the 1960 Pirates sailed to the NL pennant by seven games over the Milwaukee Braves. In their 1960 World Series victory over the New York Yankees, Stuart was held to three singles in twenty at bats with no RBIs or runs scored. Stuart was in the on deck circle as a pinch hitter when Bill Mazeroski hit the ninth-inning home run off Ralph Terry that won the World Series.\n\nHis poor performance in the World Series preceded what would be his finest season in . There were two All-Star games in 1961; Stuart was part of both NL squads. In the July 11 game at Candlestick Park, Stuart doubled in his only at bat. in the July 31 contest at Fenway Park, Stuart grounded out in his only at bat. His 35 home runs and 117 RBIs far and away led the Pirates, while he batted over .300 for the only time in his career (.301). He also led the NL with 121 strikeouts.\n\nFollowing a slow start to his season, Stuart found himself losing playing time to rookie prospect Donn Clendenon. After the season, Stuart and pitcher Jack Lamabe were traded to the Boston Red Sox for Jim Pagliaroni and Don Schwall.\n\nStuart's physical resemblance to Red Sox legend Ted Williams immediately endeared him to fans. Endearing him even more to Bosox fans was the fact that through the first 26 games of the 1963 season, Stuart had five home runs and seventeen RBIs without committing an error. That streak ended abruptly, when Stuart had errors in both games of a May 15 doubleheader with the Los Angeles Angels. His .253 batting average, seventeen home runs and fifty RBIs at the All-Star break earned him a second place finish to the Yankees' Joe Pepitone in fan balloting, but he was left off the team by American League manager Ralph Houk. He was, however, named the first baseman on the \"Sporting News\"’ AL All-Star Team.\n\nHe would earn a degree of revenge on Houk on August 15, when he hit his thirtieth home run of the season, making him the first player to hit thirty home runs in a season in both the NL and the AL. For the season, he would finish second to the Minnesota Twins' Harmon Killebrew in the AL home run race (45 to 42). While he would go on to lead the AL with 118 RBIs and 319 total bases, he would also lead major league first basemen with 29 errors, which remains both Stuart's career high and the Boston Red Sox single season record. By season's end, he had been dubbed \"Stone Fingers\" by none other than Hank Aaron. Despite his well-documented defensive struggles, on June 28, Stuart became the first first-baseman in major league history to record three assists in one inning.\n\nThe following season, Stuart would become far better known as \"Dr. Strangeglove\", a play on the film, Dr. Strangelove. Despite his 24 errors at first, Stuart still mashed with the best of them. He hit 33 home runs and was second in the AL (to the Baltimore Orioles' Brooks Robinson) with 114 RBIs.\n\nIn need of starting pitching, the Red Sox dealt Stuart to the Philadelphia Phillies at the start of the Winter meetings for left hander Dennis Bennett. Following a 6-for-14 four game series in Los Angeles against the Dodgers, Stuart raised his batting average to .297. He followed that up with an 0-for-14 slump that saw his average drop to .216, and drew the ire of manager Gene Mauch. Stuart batted .234 with 28 home runs and 95 RBIs his only season in Philadelphia. \n\nOn October 27, the Phillies acquired Gold Glove first baseman Bill White, Bob Uecker and Stuart's former Pirates teammate Dick Groat from the St. Louis Cardinals for Pat Corrales, Alex Johnson and Art Mahaffey. Four months later, Stuart was traded to the New York Mets for minor leaguers Wayne Graham, Bobby Klaus and Jimmie Schaffer.\n\nThe Mets moved 21 year old All-Star Ed Kranepool into a left field platoon with Ron Swoboda in order to make room for Stuart at first base. However, once Kranepool demonstrated that he was a terrible left fielder, and Stuart committed six errors by June 5, the idea was abandoned. The Mets released Stuart on June 15 with a .218 average, four home runs and thirteen RBIs. Shortly afterwards, he went from worst to first, signing as a free agent with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Though his role with the Dodgers was far more limited than Stuart was used to in his major league career, he returned to the post season for only the second time in his career. He appeared as a pinch hitter in games one and four of the 1966 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles, flying out to deep right center in game one, and striking out in game four.\n\nPrior to his trade to the Mets, Stuart seriously considered playing in Japan. With no Major League offers on the table for the 1967 season, he signed with Nippon Professional Baseball's Taiyo Whales. After an impressive first season with the Whales (.280 avg., 33 HR, 79 RBI), Stuart dipped to a .217 average, with sixteen home runs and forty RBIs his second season. He became known as \"Moby Dick\" while playing in Japan.).\n\nHe returned to the major leagues with the California Angels in 1969, but after 22 games in which he batted .157 with just one home run, he was released on June 3. He finished out the season with the Pacific Coast League's Phoenix Giants before retiring at the age of 36.\n\nIn January , almost four years after Stuart's retirement, it was noted that the not yet instituted designated hitter rule \"would have suited Dr. Strangeglove perfectly.\" Other, less well known but equally unflattering nicknames included \"Iron Glove\" and, in a more literary vein, \"The Ancient Mariner\", a reference to an opening line in the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner: specifically, \"It is an ancient mariner, And he stoppeth one of three\".\n\nIn their book, \"The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book\", Brendan C. Boyd and Fred C. Harris wrote an essay on Stuart's notoriously poor fielding. An excerpt: \"Every play hit his way was an adventure, the most routine play a challenge to his artlessness. It is hard to describe this to anyone who has not seen it, just as it is hard to describe Xavier Cugat or Allen Ludden. Stu once picked up a hot dog wrapper that was blowing toward his first base position. He received a standing ovation from the crowd. It was the first thing he had managed to pick up all day, and the fans realized it could very well be the last\".\n\nStuart had a daughter, Debbie Lea, from his first marriage, and two sons, Richard Lee Jr. and Robert Lance from his second marriage to Lois. He was a member of the Screen Guild Extra Union, and appeared as an extra in the film \"D-Day the Sixth of June\", and on the television shows \"Navy Log\" and \"Badge 714\". While with the Red Sox, Stuart began doing a sports TV show entitled \"Stuart on Sports\" Sunday nights after the news. He also had similar shows while with the Phillies and Mets.\n\nHe died of cancer on December 15, 2002 in Redwood City, California at the age of 70.\n\n\n\n"}

When used in conjunction with a trick name, like \"fakie ollie\", it means that the trick was performed as it would normally be done with the exception of riding backwards. Not to be confused with \"switch\" or switchstance which is literally \"switching\" ones stance (from either regular or goofy to the opposite) with the nose pointing in the direction of travel.\n\nIn snowboarding, riding with the weaker foot forward is called riding switch, and tricks done while switch are called switch tricks. The two terms are easily confused and often used interchangeably. \n\nIn skateboarding, people will add \"to fakie\" at the end of the name if the rider does a revert or lands a slide in their switch stance when they went into the trick in their normal stance (e.g. frontside boardslide to fakie, backside tailslide to fakie, etc.).\n\nIn snowboarding, in a park event, landing the other way from natural is landing switch. In a pipe event, It is called landing fakie. Freeride, powder, and alpine snowboards are non-symmetrical so theoretically riding them backwards with the tail facing downhill is riding fakie, and riding with switched bindings (goofy setting if you are regular) with the nose pointing downhill is riding switch.\n\nIn BMX a fakie is riding backwards and pedaling with the sprocket movement as you are moving backwards then at the right point turning your bars the opposite direction you want to turn and sliding out so you are riding forward again.\n\nIn Freestyle Skiing the act of descending the slope backwards is referred to as \"switch\" rather than \"fakie\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1823104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1823104", "title": "Clock skew", "text": "Clock skew\n\nClock skew (sometimes called timing skew) is a phenomenon in synchronous digital circuit systems (such as computer systems) in which the same sourced clock signal arrives at different components at different times. The instantaneous difference between the readings of any two clocks is called their skew.\n\nThe operation of most digital circuits is synchronized by a periodic signal known as a \"clock\" that dictates the sequence and pacing of the devices on the circuit. This clock is distributed from a single source to all the memory elements of the circuit, which for example could be registers or flip-flops. In a circuit using edge-triggered registers, when the clock edge or tick arrives at a register, the register transfers the register input to the register output, and these new output values flow through combinational logic to provide the values at register inputs for the next clock tick. Ideally, the input to each memory element reaches its final value in time for the next clock tick so that the behavior of the whole circuit can be predicted exactly. The maximum speed at which a system can run must account for the variance that occurs between the various elements of a circuit due to differences in physical composition, temperature, and path length.\n\nIn a synchronous circuit, two registers, or flip-flops, are said to be \"sequentially adjacent\" if a logic path connects them. Given two sequentially adjacent registers R and R with clock arrival times at destination and source register clock pins equal to T and T respectively, clock skew can be defined as: .\n\nClock skew can be caused by many different things, such as wire-interconnect length, temperature variations, variation in intermediate devices, capacitive coupling, material imperfections, and differences in input capacitance on the clock inputs of devices using the clock. As the clock rate of a circuit increases, timing becomes more critical and less variation can be tolerated if the circuit is to function properly.\n\nThere are two types of clock skew: negative skew and positive skew. Positive skew occurs when the transmitting register receives the clock tick earlier than the receiving register. Negative skew is the opposite: the receiving register gets the clock tick earlier than the sending register. Zero clock skew refers to the arrival of the clock tick simultaneously at transmitting and receiving register.\n\nThere are two types of violation that can be caused by clock skew. One problem is caused when the clock travels slower than the data path from one register to another - allowing data to penetrate two registers in the same clock tick, or maybe destroying the integrity of the latched data. This is called a hold violation because the previous data is not held long enough at the destination flip-flop to be properly clocked through. Another problem is caused if the destination flip-flop receives the clock tick earlier than the source flip-flop - the data signal has that much less time to reach the destination flip-flop before the next clock tick. If it fails to do so, a setup violation occurs, so-called because the new data was not set up and stable before the next clock tick arrived. A hold violation is more serious than a setup violation because it cannot be fixed by increasing the clock period. Positive skew and negative skew cannot negatively impact setup and hold timing constraints respectively (see inequalities below).\n\nClock skew can also benefit a circuit by decreasing the clock period locally at which the circuit will operate correctly. For each source register and destination register connected by a path, the following setup and hold inequalities must be obeyed:\n\nwhere\n\nPositive clock skews are good for fixing setup violations, but can cause hold violations. Negative clock skew can guard against a hold violation, but can cause a setup violation.\n\nIn the above inequalities, a single parameter, \"J\", is used to account for jitter. This parameter must be an upper bound for the difference in jitter over all source register/destination register pairs. However, if the structure of the clock distribution network is known, different source register/destination register pairs may have different jitter parameters, and a different jitter value may be used for the hold constraint in contrast to the value for the setup constraint. For example, if the source register and destination register receive their clock signals from a common nearby clock buffer, the jitter bound for that hold constraint can be very small, since any variation in that clock signal will affect the two registers equally. For the same example, the jitter bound for the setup constraint must be larger than for the hold constraint, because jitter can vary from clock tick to clock tick. If the source register receives its clock signal from a leaf buffer of the clock distribution network that is far removed from the leaf buffer feeding the destination register, then the jitter bound will have to be larger to account for the different clock paths to the two registers, which may have different noise sources coupling into them.\n\nFigures 1 and 2 illustrate a situation where intentional clock skew can benefit a synchronous circuit. In the zero-skew circuit of Figure 1, a long path goes from flip-flop FF1 to flip-flop FF2, and a short path, such as a shift-register path, from FF2 to FF3. The FF2 -> FF3 path is dangerously close to having a hold violation: If even a small amount of extra clock delay occurs at FF3, this could destroy the data at the D input of FF3 before the clock arrives to clock it through to FF3's Q output. This could happen even if FF2 and FF3 were physically close to each other, if their clock inputs happened to come from different leaf buffers of a clock distribution network.\n\nFigure 2 shows how the problem can be fixed with intentional clock skew. A small amount of extra delay is interposed before FF2's clock input, which then safely positions the FF2 -> FF3 path away from its hold violation. As an added benefit, this same extra clock delay relaxes the setup constraint for the FF1 -> FF2 path. The FF1 -> FF2 path can operate correctly at a clock period that is less than what is required for the zero clock skew case, by an amount equal to the delay of the added clock delay buffer.\n\nA common misconception about intentional clock skew is that it is necessarily more dangerous than zero clock skew, or that it requires more precise control of delays in the clock distribution network. However it is the zero skew circuit of Figure 1 that is closer to malfunctioning - a small amount of positive clock skew for the FF2 -> FF3 pair will cause a hold violation, whereas the intentional skew circuit of Figure 2 is more tolerant of unintended delay variations in clock distribution.\n\nIf the clock arrival times at individual registers are viewed as variables to be adjusted in order to minimize the clock period while satisfying the setup and hold inequalities for all of the paths through the circuit, then the result is a Linear Programming problem. In this linear program, zero clock skew is merely a feasible point - the solution to the linear program generally gives a clock period that is less than what is achieved by zero skew. In addition, safety margins greater than or equal to the zero skew case can be guaranteed by setting setup and hold times and jitter bound appropriately in the linear program.\n\nDue to the simple form of this linear program, an easily programmed algorithm is available for arriving at a solution.\nMost CAD systems for VLSI and FPGA design contain facilities for optimizing clock skews.\n\nIn addition to clock skew due to static differences in the clock latency from the clock source to each clocked register, no clock signal is perfectly periodic, so that the clock period or clock cycle time varies even at a single component, and this variation is known as clock jitter. At a particular point in a clock distribution network, jitter is the only contributor to the clock timing uncertainty.\n\nAs an approximation, it is often useful to discuss the total clock timing uncertainty between two registers as the sum of spatial clock skew (the spatial differences in clock latency from the clock source), and clock jitter (meaning the non-periodicity of the clock at a particular point in the network). Unfortunately, spatial clock skew varies in time from one cycle to the next due to local time-dependent variations in the power supply, local temperature, and noise coupling to other signals.\n\nThus, in the usual case of sending and receiving registers at different locations, there is no clear way to separate the total clock timing uncertainty into spatial skew and jitter. Thus some authors use the term clock skew to describe the sum of spatial clock skew and clock jitter. This of course means that the clock skew between two points varies from cycle to cycle, which is a complexity that is rarely mentioned. Many other authors use the term clock skew only for the spatial variation of clock times, and use the term clock jitter to represent the rest of the total clock timing uncertainty. This of course means that the clock jitter must be different at each component, which again is rarely discussed.\n\nFortunately, in many cases, spatial clock skew remains fairly constant from cycle to cycle, so that the rest of the total clock timing uncertainty can be well approximated by a single common clock jitter value.\n\nOn a network such as the internet, clock skew describes the difference in frequency (first derivative of offset with time) of different clocks within the network . Network operations that require timestamps which are comparable across hosts can be affected by clock skew. A number of protocols (e.g. Network Time Protocol) have been designed to reduce clock skew, and produce more stable functions. Some applications (such as game servers) may also use their own synchronization mechanism to avoid reliability problems due to clock skew.\n\nClock skew is the reason why at fast speeds or long distances, serial interfaces (e.g. Serial Attached SCSI or USB) are preferred over parallel interfaces (e.g. parallel SCSI).\n\n\n"}

AllMusic describes the band as \"the bastard sons of Foghat, AC/DC, and ZZ Top after being weaned on punk rock, unafraid of massive guitar riffs, outsized personalities, or pledging allegiance to sex, weed, and Satan with a wink and a nudge.\"\n\nBassist/singer Eddie Spaghetti (real name Edward Daly) leads the band and is its only constant member. Their current lineup also includes guitarist Marty Chandler and drummer Christopher von Streicher. Their most recent album, \"Play That Rock N' Roll\", was released in February 2020.\n\nThe Supersuckers were formed in late 1988 as The Black Supersuckers in Tucson, Arizona, first playing traditional punk rock. The original line-up was Eddie Spaghetti (Edward Daly) on bass, Dan \"Thunder\" Bolton and Ron \"Rontrose\" Heathman on guitar, Dan Siegal (who later used the stage name Dancing Eagle) on drums, and Eric Martin on vocals. All had been high school friends in Tuscon. In 1989, they moved to Seattle, Washington due to limited interest in their hometown scene. Martin then left the band, and Eddie Spaghetti took over on vocals. They recorded numerous singles and cover songs for various small labels before being signed to Sub Pop. Their early recordings are compiled on the 1992 release \"The Songs All Sound the Same\". Their first album with Sub Pop, \"The Smoke of Hell\", was released in 1992, featuring a cover by graphic artist Dan Clowes.\n\nIn 1995, guitarist Heathman temporarily left the band and was replaced by Rick Sims, formerly of the Didjits (and later the Gaza Strippers), for the recording of their third album, \"The Sacrilicious Sounds of the Supersuckers\", which was produced by Paul Leary. Also in 1995, the Supersuckers played at Farm Aid for the first time. In 1997, Heathman returned for the recording of their fourth album, \"Must've Been High\", which signaled a move into alternative country after the hard rock of the previous two albums. The album included a guest appearance by Willie Nelson, with whom the band had performed onstage at Farm Aid.\n\nThe band's final album with Sub-Pop was the compilation \"How the Supersuckers Became the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World\" in 1999. The band had left Sub Pop to sign a major-label deal with Interscope and announced a new traditional rock album, but they were dropped from the label during corporate restructuring and the planned album was never released. Some songs from the lost Interscope album appeared on the album \"The Evil Powers of Rock 'N' Roll\" in 1999, released on a small independent label. They contributed two songs, including one in collaboration with Eddie Vedder, to the charity album \"Free the West Memphis 3\" in 2000. Disillusioned by the experience with Interscope, the band started their own label, Mid-Fi Recordings, in 2002. \n\nTheir first self-released album was \"Motherfuckers Be Trippin'\" in 2003. Drummer Dancing Eagle then left the band and was replaced by a series of temporary drummers, including Mike \"Murderburger\" Musburger, Dusty Watson, and Scott \"Scottzilla\" Churilla (who had previously played with Reverend Horton Heat). After several live albums and archival compilations released on their Mid-Fi label, Dancing Eagle returned to the lineup temporarily for their next full-length album, \"Get It Together\", in 2008. The band then took an extended hiatus, during which Ron Heathman and Dancing Eagle left the band for the second time each and Eddie Spaghetti released two solo albums via Bloodshot Records. The band discontinued its Mid-Fi label and signed with Steamhammer Records, issuing the hard rock-oriented album \"Get the Hell\" in 2014. This album introduced new members \"Metal\" Marty Chandler on guitar and Christopher \"Chango\" von Streicher on drums. \n\nIn 2015, Eddie Spaghetti recovered from a cancer diagnosis, while the only other remaining original member of the band, Dan Bolton, departed and was not replaced. Now a trio with Spaghetti, Chandler, and von Streicher, the Supersuckers experimented with country music again in the 2015 album \"Holdin' the Bag\". They returned to hard rock for the 2018 album \"Suck It\". The album \"Play That Rock N' Roll\", recorded at Willie Nelson's home studio in Austin, Texas, was released by Steamhammer in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The motorway is about long, and features eight traffic lanes with a speed limit between the M6 Logan Motorway and Smith Street Motorway and generally six or four lanes at on other sections. The motorway passes through the major tourist region of the Gold Coast, the destination for most of the vehicular traffic from Brisbane. More than A$2 billion was spent on the motorway between 1990 and 1998, including widening the road and safety measures.\n\nThe motorway passes Gold Coast attractions such as Warner Bros. Movie World, Wet'n'Wild Water World, and Dreamworld, which are among the most popular theme parks in Australia. Since 2008 the motorway connects with the Tweed Heads bypass in New South Wales.\n\nThere are also plans to progressively widen the four lane section from Nerang to Tugun to six lanes. The first section of this upgrade (Nerang to Varsity Lakes) was completed in May 2012. Planning is ongoing for the remaining section of the upgrade (Varsity Lakes to Tugun).\n\nThe highest point of the motorway is on a cutting south of Brisbane (between Cudgera Creek Rd and Sleepy Hollow Rest Area).\n\nThe first section, opened in Brisbane in November 1972, was originally known as the Southeast Freeway. It included the Riverside Expressway which was designed to alleviate traffic congestion in central Brisbane. The Southeast Freeway was connected to the Pacific Highway at Springwood in 1985. The Southeast Freeway was designated originally as the F3, but this nomenclature was removed in 1994.\n\nOn 15 April 1996 it was announced that the Pacific Highway between the intersection with the Logan Motorway and Nerang would be upgraded to motorway standard. From the Albert River at Beenleigh to Coombabah Creek at Gaven, about , the road surface is portland cement concrete. The upgraded road was opened to the public in October 2000.\n\nIn March 2006, the Queensland Government released planning for substantial changes to the section between Springwood and Daisy Hill, mainly at the entrances and exits along the section to deal with substantial traffic problems on surrounding streets and traffic backups onto the motorway. The planned upgrade led to some popular protest, mainly by people whose homes would be resumed for the project. Construction of the upgrade commenced in November 2009 and was completed in November 2012.\n\nThe Tugun Bypass was completed in 2008. It has four lanes (two in each direction in 2008 and provision for six lane widening in the future). Widening from four lanes to six lanes is planned for 2025.\n\nBelow is an overview of when each stage of the motorway was completed (from north to south):\n\n\n\n\nThe NSW section of the Pacific Motorway to is part of the Pacific Highway upgrade from the Queensland border to Ballina. It was renamed to Pacific Motorway from Pacific Highway in February 2013.\n\nThe motorway was first completed in July 1985 with the opening of first stage of Tweed Heads Bypass, followed by the second stage in November 1992. The most recent addition to the motorway is the Banora Point upgrade which opened in September 2012.\n\nBelow is an overview of when each stage of the motorway was completed (from south to north):\n\nThe Pacific Motorway, when it was upgraded in September 2000, was the first motorway in Queensland to have service centres integrated. There are two service centres, Stapylton servicing southbound traffic, and Coomera servicing northbound traffic. The travel centres include fuel and fast-food restaurants, picnic areas and a shop. Solar panels on the roofs of the centres provide power to the facilities.\n\nThere is a fixed speed camera on the Pacific Motorway at Tarragindi, facing northbound. There is another at Loganholme just after the Logan Motorway exit facing northbound. A third set of speed cameras, situated on the northbound side of the motorway at the Smith Street overpass at Gaven, became active around March 2013.\n\nBeenleigh to Coolangatta is within the City of Gold Coast. The city has a population of 500,000 and is Australia's sixth-largest city. The oceanside parts of the Gold Coast are characterised by high-rises, residential canal developments, a casino, theme parks, amusement parks and numerous tourist attractions, whilst its inland suburbs are leafy and well kept, looking much like the newer suburbia of other large Australian cities. The Gold Coast attracts tourists from around the world and is one of Australia's leading tourist destinations. Most of the city is bypassed by the Pacific Motorway (M1 Motorway) which continues from Metroad 3 at Logan City south of Brisbane. The former route of the Pacific Highway through the Gold Coast has been renamed as the Gold Coast Highway. The Gold Coast Highway was very congested until the Tugun Bypass opened in June 2008 bypassing a badly traffic snarled section near the Gold Coast Airport.\n\nThe highway crosses the Tweed River south of Banora Point. Tweed Heads is the major commercial centre of the southern part of the Gold Coast, which extends as far south as Chinderah in New South Wales. It was known as a \"twin town\" along with Coolangatta, Queensland before they coalesced with other towns to form the suburbia of the Gold Coast. The Tweed River valley contains the Cudgen Road Tunnel completed in 2002. The tunnel was built to avoid the visual impact of a road cutting.\n\n\n"}

Initially, Turkish Cypriots favoured the continuation of British rule. However, they were alarmed by the Greek Cypriot calls for \"enosis\", as they saw that the union of Crete with Greece had led to the exodus of Cretan Turks, which was a precedent to be avoided, and they took a pro-partition stance in response to the militant activity of EOKA. Turkish Cypriots also viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island and believed in their having a separate right to self-determination from Greek Cypriots. Meanwhile, in the 1950s, Turkish leader Adnan Menderes considered Cyprus an \"extension of Anatolia\", rejected the partition of Cyprus along ethnic lines and supported the annexation of the whole island to Turkey. Nationalistic slogans centered on the idea that \"Cyprus is Turkish\", and the ruling party declared Cyprus to be part of the Turkish homeland and vital for its security. Upon realising that Turkish Cypriots were only 20% of the islanders and so annexation was unfeasible, the national policy was changed to favour partition. The slogan \"Partition or Death\" was frequently used in Turkish Cypriot and Turkish protests in the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s. Although after the Zurich and London Conferences, Turkey seemed both to accept the existence of the Cypriot state and to distance itself from its policy of favouring the partition of the island, the goal of Turkish and Turkish Cypriot leaders remained that of creating an independent Turkish state in the northern part of the island.\n\n"}

{"id": "1823144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1823144", "title": "Scanning transmission electron microscopy", "text": "Scanning transmission electron microscopy\n\nA scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) is a type of transmission electron microscope (TEM). Pronunciation is [stɛm] or [ɛsti:i:ɛm]. As with a conventional transmission electron microscope (CTEM), images are formed by electrons passing through a sufficiently thin specimen. However, unlike CTEM, in STEM the electron beam is focused to a fine spot (with the typical spot size 0.05 – 0.2 nm) which is then scanned over the sample in a raster illumination system constructed so that the sample is illuminated at each point with the beam parallel to the optical axis. The rastering of the beam across the sample makes STEM suitable for analytical techniques such as Z-contrast annular dark-field imaging, and spectroscopic mapping by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, or electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). These signals can be obtained simultaneously, allowing direct correlation of images and spectroscopic data.\n\nA typical STEM is a conventional transmission electron microscope equipped with additional scanning coils, detectors and necessary circuitry, which allows it to switch between operating as a STEM, or a CTEM; however, dedicated STEMs are also manufactured.\n\nHigh resolution scanning transmission electron microscopes require exceptionally stable room environments. In order to obtain atomic resolution images in STEM, the level of vibration, temperature fluctuations, electromagnetic waves, and acoustic waves must be limited in the room housing the microscope.\n\nIn 1925, Louis de Broglie first theorized the wave-like properties of an electron, with a wavelength substantially smaller than visible light. This would allow the use of electrons to image objects much smaller than the previous diffraction limit set by visible light. The first STEM was built in 1938 by Baron Manfred von Ardenne, working in Berlin for Siemens. However, at the time the results were inferior to those of transmission electron microscopy, and von Ardenne only spent two years working on the problem. The microscope was destroyed in an air raid in 1944, and von Ardenne did not return to his work after World War II.\n\nThe technique was not developed further until the 1970s, when Albert Crewe at the University of Chicago developed the field emission gun and added a high quality objective lens to create a modern STEM. He demonstrated the ability to image atoms using an annular dark field detector. Crewe and coworkers at the University of Chicago developed the cold field emission electron source and built a STEM able to visualize single heavy atoms on thin carbon substrates.\n\nBy the late 1980s and early 1990s, improvements in STEM technology allowed for samples to be imaged with better than 2 Å resolution, meaning that atomic structure could be imaged in some materials.\n\nThe addition of an aberration corrector to STEMs enables electron probes to be focused to sub-ångström diameters, allowing images with sub-ångström resolution to be acquired. This has made it possible to identify individual atomic columns with unprecedented clarity.\nAberration-corrected STEM was demonstrated with 1.9 Å resolution in 1997 and soon after in 2000 with roughly 1.36 Å resolution. Advanced aberration-corrected STEMs have since been developed with sub-50 pm resolution. \nAberration-corrected STEM provides the added resolution and beam current critical to the implementation of atomic resolution chemical and elemental spectroscopic mapping.\n\nScanning transmission electron microscopes are used to characterize the nanoscale, and atomic scale structure of specimens, providing important insights into the properties and behaviour of materials and biological cells.\n\nScanning transmission electron microscopy has been applied to characterize the structure of a wide range of material specimens, including solar cells, semiconductor devices, \ncomplex oxides, \nbatteries, \nfuel cells, \ncatalysts, \nand 2D materials.\n\nThe first application of STEM to the imaging of biological molecules was demonstrated in 1971. The advantage of STEM imaging of biological samples is the high contrast of annular dark-field images, which can allow imaging of biological samples without the need for staining. STEM has been widely used to solve a number of structural problems in molecular biology.\n\nIn annular dark-field mode, images are formed by fore-scattered electrons incident on an annular detector, which lies outside of the path of the directly transmitted beam.\nBy using a high-angle ADF detector, it is possible to form atomic resolution images where the contrast of an atomic column is directly related to the atomic number (Z-contrast image). Directly interpretable Z-contrast imaging makes STEM imaging with a high-angle detector an appealing technique in contrast to conventional high resolution electron microscopy, in which phase-contrast effects mean that atomic resolution images must be compared to simulations to aid interpretation.\n\nIn STEM, bright-field detectors are located in the path of the transmitted electron beam. Axial bright-field detectors are located in the centre of the cone of illumination of the transmitted beam, and are often used to provide complementary images to those obtained by ADF imaging. Annular bright-field detectors, located within the cone of illumination of the transmitted beam, have been used to obtain atomic resolution images in which the atomic columns of light elements such as oxygen are visible.\n\nDifferential phase contrast (DPC) is an imaging mode which relies on the beam being deflected by electromagnetic fields. In the classical case, the fast electrons in the electron beam is deflected by the Lorentz force, as shown schematically for a magnetic field in the figure to the left. The fast electron with charge −1 passing through an electric field E and a magnetic field B experiences a force F:\n\nformula_1\n\nFor a magnetic field, this can be expressed as the amount of beam deflection experienced by the electron, :\n\nformula_2\n\nwhere formula_3 is the wavelength of the electron, formula_4 the Planck constant and formula_5 is integrated magnetic induction along the trajectory of the electron. This last term reduces to formula_6 when the electron beam is perpendicular to a sample of thickness formula_7 with constant in-plane magnetic induction of magnitude formula_8. The beam deflection can then be imaged on a segmented or pixelated detector. This can be used to image magnetic and electric fields in materials. While the beam deflection mechanism through the Lorentz force is the most intuitive way of understanding DPC, a quantum mechanical approach is necessary to understand the phase-shift generated by the electromagnetic fields through the Aharonov–Bohm effect.\n\nImaging most ferromagnetic materials require the current in the objective lens of the STEM to be reduced to almost zero. This is due to the sample residing inside the magnetic field of the objective lens, which can be several Tesla, which for most ferromagnetic materials would destroy any magnetic domain structure. However, turning the objective lens almost off drastically increase the amount of aberrations in the STEM probe, leading to an increase in the probe size, and reduction in resolution. By using a probe aberration corrector it is possible to get a resolution of 1 nm.\n\nRecently, detectors have been developed for STEM that can record a complete convergent beam electron diffraction pattern of all scattered and unscattered electrons at every pixel in a scan of the sample in a large four-dimensional dataset (a 2D diffraction pattern recorded at every 2D probe position). Due to the four-dimensional nature of the datasets, the term \"4D STEM\" has become a common name for this technique. The 4D datasets generated using the technique can be analyzed to reconstruct images equivalent to those of any conventional detector geometry, and can be used to map fields in the sample at high spatial resolution, including information about strain and electric fields. The technique can also be used to perform ptychography.\n\nAs the electron beam passes through the sample, some electrons in the beam lose energy via inelastic scattering interactions with electrons in the sample. In electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), the energy lost by the electrons in the beam is measured using an electron spectrometer, allowing features such as plasmons, and elemental ionization edges to be identified. Energy resolution in EELS is sufficient to allow the fine structure of ionization edges to be observed, which means that EELS can be used for chemical mapping, as well as elemental mapping. In STEM, EELS can be used to spectroscopically map a sample at atomic resolution. Recently developed monochromators can achieve an energy resolution of ~10 meV in EELS, allowing vibrational spectra to be acquired in STEM.\n\nIn energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) or (EDXS), which is also referred to in literature as X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) or (XEDS), an X-ray spectrometer is used to detect the characteristic X-rays that are emitted by atoms in the sample as they are ionized by electron in the beam. In STEM, EDX is typically used for compositional analysis and elemental mapping of samples. Typical X-ray detectors for electron microscopes cover only a small solid angle, which makes X-ray detection relatively inefficient since X-rays are emitted from the sample in every direction. However, detectors covering large solid angles have been recently developed, and atomic resolution X-ray mapping has even been achieved.\n\nConvergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED) is a STEM technique that provides information about crystal structure at a specific point in a sample. In CBED, the width of the area a diffraction pattern is acquired from is equal to the size of the probe used, which can be smaller than 1 Å in an aberration-corrected STEM (see above). CBED differs from conventional electron diffraction in that CBED patterns consist of diffraction disks, rather than spots. The width of CBED disks is determined by the convergence angle of the electron beam. Other features, such as Kikuchi lines are often visible in CBED patterns. CBED can be used to determine the point and space groups of a specimen.\n\nElectron microscopy has accelerated research in materials science by quantifying properties and features from nanometer-resolution imaging with STEM, which is crucial in observing and confirming factors, such as thin film deposition, crystal growth, surface structure formation, and dislocation movement. Until recently, most papers have inferred the properties and behaviors of material systems based off these images without being able to establish rigorous rules for what exactly is observed. The techniques that have emerged as a result of interest in quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy (QSTEM) closes this gap by allowing researchers to identify and quantify structural features that are only visible using high-resolution imaging in a STEM. Widely available image processing techniques are applied to high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images of atomic columns to precisely locate their positions and the material's lattice constant(s). This ideology has been successfully used to quantify structural properties, such as strain and bond angle, at interfaces and defect complexes. QSTEM allows researchers to now compare the experimental data to theoretical simulations both qualitatively and quantitatively. Recent studies published have shown that QSTEM can measure structural properties, such as interatomic distances, lattice distortions from point defects, and locations of defects within an atomic column, with high accuracy. QSTEM can also be applied to selected area diffraction patterns and convergent beam diffraction patterns to quantify the degree and types of symmetry present in a specimen. Since any materials research requires structure-property relationship studies, this technique is applicable to countless fields. A notable study is the mapping of atomic column intensities and interatomic bond angles in a mott-insulator system. This was the first study to show that the transition from the insulating to conducting state was due to a slight global decrease in distortion, which was concluded by mapping the interatomic bond angles as a function of the dopant concentration. This effect is not visible by the human eye in a standard atomic-scale image enabled by HAADF imaging, thus this important finding was only made possible due to the application of QSTEM.\n\nQSTEM analysis can be achieved using commonplace software and programming languages, such as MatLab or Python, with the help of toolboxes and plug-ins that serve to expedite the process. This is analysis that can be performed virtually anywhere. Consequently, the largest roadblock is acquiring a high-resolution, aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope that can provide the images necessary to provide accurate quantification of structural properties at the atomic level. Most university research groups, for example, require permission to use such high-end electron microscopes at national lab facilities, which requires excessive time commitment. Universal challenges mainly involve becoming accustomed to the programming language desired and writing software that can tackle the very specific problems for a given material system. For example, one can imagine how a different analysis technique, and thus a separate image processing algorithm, is necessary for studying ideal cubic versus complex monoclinic structures.\n\nSpecialized sample holders or modifications to the microscope can allow a number of additional techniques to be performed in STEM. Some examples are described below.\n\nSTEM tomography allows the complete three-dimensional internal and external structure of a specimen to be reconstructed from a tilt-series of 2D projection images of the specimen acquired at incremental tilts. High angle ADF STEM is a particularly useful imaging mode for electron tomography because the intensity of high angle ADF-STEM images varies only with the projected mass-thickness of the sample, and the atomic number of atoms in the sample. This yields highly interpretable three dimensional reconstructions.\n\nCryo-electron microscopy in STEM (Cryo-STEM) allows specimens to be held in the microscope at liquid nitrogen or liquid helium temperatures. This is useful for imaging specimens that would be volatile in high vacuum at room temperature. Cryo-STEM has been used to study vitrified biological samples, vitrified solid-liquid interfaces in material specimens, and specimens containing elemental sulfur, which is prone to sublimation in electron microscopes at room temperature.\n\nIn order to study the reactions of particles in gaseous environments, a STEM may be modified with a differentially pumped sample chamber to allow gas flow around the sample, whilst a specialized holder is used to control the reaction temperature. Alternatively a holder mounted with an enclosed gas flow cell may be used.\nNanoparticles and biological cells have been studied in liquid environments using liquid-phase electron microscopy in STEM, accomplished by mounting a microfluidic enclosure in the specimen holder.\n\nA low-voltage electron microscope (LVEM) is an electron microscope that is designed to operate at relatively low electron accelerating voltages of between 0.5 and 30 kV. Some LVEMs can function as an SEM, a TEM and a STEM in a single compact instrument. Using a low beam voltage increases image contrast which is especially important for biological specimens. This increase in contrast significantly reduces, or even eliminates the need to stain biological samples. Resolutions of a few nm are possible in TEM, SEM and STEM modes. The low energy of the electron beam means that permanent magnets can be used as lenses and thus a miniature column that does not require cooling can be used.\n\n"}

{"id": "1823150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1823150", "title": "Türbe", "text": "Türbe\n\nTürbe is the Turkish word for \"tomb\". It is related to the Arabic \"turbah\" (meaning \"\"soil/ ground/ earth\"\"), which can also mean a mausoleum, but more often a funerary complex, or a plot in a cemetery. It has the characteristic mausoleums, often relatively small, of Ottoman royalty and Ottoman nobles and notables.\n\nA typical türbe mausoleum is located in the grounds of a mosque or complex, often endowed by the deceased. However, some are more closely integrated into surrounding buildings. They are usually relatively small buildings, often hexagonal or octagonal in shape, containing a single chamber, which may well be decorated with coloured tiles. A dome surmounts the building. They are normally kept closed, but the inside can be sometimes be glimpsed through metal grilles over the windows or door. The exterior is typically masonry, perhaps with tiled decoration over the doorway, but the interior often contains large areas of painted tilework, which may be of the highest quality.\n\nInside, the body or bodies repose in plain stone sarcophagi, perhaps with a simple inscription, which are, or were originally, covered by rich cloth drapes. In general the sarcophagi are merely symbolic, and the actual body lies below the floor. At the head of the tomb in some examples a wooden pole was surmounted by a white cloth Ottoman turban (for men), or the turban could be in stone.\n\nEarlier examples often had two or more storeys, following the example of the Ilkhanate and Persian tombs on which the style was based; the Malek Tomb is a good example of these. The Ottoman style is also supposed to reflect the shape of the tents used by the earlier nomadic Ottomans, and their successors when on military campaigns. Sultans often built their tombs during their lifetimes, although those of other family members, and some sultans, were built after their deaths. Sultan Murad I, assassinated just after his victory at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, has his türbe there, with his vital organs, while the rest was carried back to his capital at Bursa, where he has another türbe.\n\nThere are many famous \"türbes\" across Istanbul of the various sultans of the Ottoman Empire, as well as of other notables from Turkish history. \n\nThe Süleymaniye Mosque complex has some of the most famous, including that of Suleiman himself (1550s), perhaps the most splendid Ottoman \"türbe\", and that of his wife Hürrem Sultan, which has extremely fine tilework. Close by to the complex is the \"türbe\" of its famous architect Mimar Sinan, in what was his garden.\n\nKonya holds two earlier \"türbe\", with conical roofs, of the Seljuk Rum dynasty in the Alâeddin Mosque (12th century onwards), and the \"türbe\" of Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi, which is a major shrine and pilgrimage point, just like the türbe of Gül Baba in Budapest, Hungary. Bursa, a capital of the earlier Ottomans before the conquest of Constantinople, holds the \"turbes\" of many of the earlier Ottoman Sultans including Osman I and his son, the Muradiye Complex containing Murad II and many princes, and the Yeşil Türbe of Mehmed I (died 1421). This is a large three-story tower, and the (false) sarcophagus itself is covered in tiles. Unusually, much of the exterior is covered with undecorated coloured tiles.\n\nIn Bulgaria, the heptagonal \"türbes\" of dervish saints such as Kıdlemi Baba, Ak Yazılı Baba, Demir Baba and Otman Baba served as the centers of Bektashi tekkes (gathering places) before 1826. The türbe of Haji Bektash Veli is located in the original Bektashi tekke (now a museum) in the town that now bears his name and remains a site for Alevi pilgrims from throughout Turkey.\n\nAt the peak of the Ottoman empire, under Gazi Husrev-beg Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, became the biggest and most important Ottoman city in the Balkans after Istanbul, with largest marketplace (modern days Baščaršija), and numerous mosques, which by the middle of the 16th century numbered more than 100. By 1660, the population of Sarajevo was estimated to be over 80,000. Husrev-beg greatly shaped the physical city, as most of what is now the Old Town was built during his reign. The Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque (Bosnian: Gazi Husrev-begova Džamija, Turkish: Gazi Hüsrev Bey Camii), is a mosque in Sarajevo historic marketplace Baščaršija, and it was built in 16th century. It is the largest historical mosque in Bosnia and Herzegovina and one of the most representative Ottoman structures in the Balkans. Gazi Husrev-beg's turbe is located in the mosque courtyard.\n\nTravnik, in modern Bosnia and Herzegovina, became the capital of the Ottoman province of Bosnia and residence of the Bosnian viziers after 1699, when Sarajevo was set ablaze by Prince Eugene of Savoy. The Grand Viziers were sometimes buried in Travnik, and türbe shrines were erected in their honour in the heart of Old town of Travnik, where they stand today.\n\nThe türbe of Idrisz Baba stands in Pécs, Hungary and was built in 1591. It features an octagonal base and domed sepulchre, with ogee-shaped lower windows and circular upper windows on the facade. It is one of only two surviving türbes of its kind in Hungary (the other is the Tomb of Gül Baba), and plays an important role in the record of Ottoman architecture in Hungary.\n\nNot much is known about the Turkish person entombed in the türbe of Idrisz Baba; however, he was considered to be a holy man with the power to work miracles. It was later used as a storage facility for gunpowder. The türbe has been furnished with a mausoleum, embroidered sheet, and prayer mat by the Turkish government. Both the türbe of Idrisz Baba and the türbe of Gül Baba are places of pilgrimage for Muslims.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1823153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1823153", "title": "California State Route 79", "text": "California State Route 79\n\nState Route 79 (SR 79) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California. The route begins at Interstate 8 (I-8) in San Diego County, continuing north through the town of Cuyamaca into Julian. After passing through Warner Springs, the route crosses into Riverside County, serving the cities of Temecula and Murrieta. SR 79 ends at I-10 in Beaumont.\n\nSR 79 begins at I-8, about east of San Diego. The road runs along Old Highway 80 in the town of Descanso, until splitting to the north at a T intersection. The route then traverses Cuyamaca and Cuyamaca Rancho State Park on its way north. This portion of the route is very serpentine, with hairpin turns, as it follows the contours of the land by moving laterally, rather than up-and-down or via cuts.\n\nIt then overlaps SR 78 between Santa Ysabel and Julian, a distance of about . At Julian, both routes join at a T intersection just south of town, thus requiring a turn to stay on SR 79, and turn at an intersection in the northern portion of downtown. At Santa Ysabel, SR 79 comes to a T intersection with SR 78 running east–west. SR 79 continues northwest, meeting the eastern terminus of SR 76 near Lake Henshaw at the settlement of Morettis and passing through Warner Springs before crossing into Riverside County. SR 79 then meets the western terminus of SR 371 before going through Aguanga. It then passes Vail Lake and parallels Temecula Creek as it approaches the Temecula city limits, where it becomes a city-maintained road.\n\nIt overlaps I-15 for about three miles through Temecula. The ramps connecting SR 79 to I-15 are the first and third ramps northbound (second and fourth southbound) of those located between the Riverside/San Diego county line and the I-15/I-215 junction. In both cases, to enter SR 79 from I-15, one must head slightly east (although SR 79 is signed as a north–south highway). The southern exit from I-15 is known as Temecula Parkway, which was the name given to the southern portion of the route in September 2007. SR 79 exits from I-15 in the northern area of Temecula as Winchester Road. It then runs along the eastern city limits of Murrieta before passing by the reservoir at Diamond Valley Lake. SR 79 continues through the community of Winchester and turns east on Florida Avenue west of Hemet. The section between those concurrent with SR 74 and Interstate 15 (in Temecula, Murrieta, Winchester, and Hemet) is posted as Winchester Road.\n\nIn Hemet, SR 79 overlaps State Route 74 (Florida Avenue), following it eastward for a few miles before heading north again through San Jacinto. SR 79 goes over a range of hills (Lambs Canyon) and ends near Beaumont at Interstate 10.\n\nThe portion north of I-15 (to Beaumont) varies between a two-lane country road (notably in Winchester) and a city arterial with four or more lanes in Temecula, Murrieta, Hemet, San Jacinto, and Beaumont, with a four-lane divided highway between the Ramona Expressway (at the northwest corner of San Jacinto) and the southern edge of Beaumont. (This highway section only has two access points; a signalled T intersection for a county landfill facility, and an interchange for Gilman Springs Road just north of the Ramona Expressway intersection.) The northern portion of this roadway is sometimes referred to as the Ramona Expressway.\n\nSR 79 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and from the northern I-15 junction to I-10 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. It is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System; however, it is not a scenic highway as defined by Caltrans. In 2012, SR 79 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 1,550 between Paso Picacho Campground and Sunrise Highway, and 30,500 at Murrieta Hot Springs Road, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.\n\nA stage road went through Oak Grove, and stagecoaches ran from 1858 to 1861 on a route from San Francisco to St. Louis and Memphis. A ranch house, Warner's Ranch, near Warner Springs was a stop on both the San Antonio–San Diego Mail and the Butterfield Overland Mail. A railroad line to Cuyamaca was under construction by 1887, though in 1889 the project encountered problems from workers departing to work in the nearby gold mines. By 1906, the stage road ran from Temecula through Warner Springs into Santa Ysabel and Ramona, and regularly scheduled automobile service was to begin in 1908 between San Diego and Warner Hot Springs.\n\nThat year, at a meeting between citizens of Oceanside and Escondido, each city proposed that a road from it to Warner Springs be constructed; the roads would meet somewhere in the San Luis Rey River valley. The president of the Escondido National Bank proposed a route from Escondido to Warner Springs shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, in 1911 \"The San Diego Union\" described the future road to Descanso, and described a \"branch of the highway\" that went through the Valley of the Pines \"which for beauty cannot be surpassed in the United States\" before continuing to Julian, the beginning of the San Luis Rey River, and Oceanside. However, the next year, the county highway commissioners determined that more funding would be needed to complete the road to Warner Springs.\n\nBy November 1912, the road to Warner Springs from San Diego was completed, including the part from Santa Ysabel, which had been widened. The road south of Julian to Decanso was open by 1916, but had a narrow crossing at the Cuyamaca dam, making the trip difficult. In 1922, the Automobile Club of Southern California noted that from Santa Ysabel to Julian, the road was in good repair, as well as from Cuyamaca to Descanso, even though the latter was a dirt road; the Julian to Cuyamaca road had \"several soft spots\". Seven years later, Julian residents expressed a desire to have the road from there to Descanso paved. Between Descanso and Temecula, what was to become SR 79 was defined as Route 78 in 1933.\n\nIn 1947, a contract to grade and pave part of what was known as State Sign Route 79 between Santa Ysabel and Julian was let, as paving of the highway progressed. The next year, plans were presented to realign part of the road between Julian and Cuyamaca, including one proposal to have it cross the lake. The California Chamber of Commerce made the suggestion in 1962 to convert SR 79 from Descanso to Julian to be an expressway. However, in 1968 those plans were called into question when the county planning commission recommended that the freeway be realigned away from Cuyamaca State Park, or not be built at all.\n\nIn the 1964 state highway renumbering, the highway was redefined as State Route 79, south of the junction with SR 71; from Temecula to that junction, the route was designated as SR 71 itself. In 1974, the part between the former junction with SR 71 and I-15 was added to SR 79, and removed from SR 71. \n\nOriginally, SR 79 was routed on Sage Road between Hemet and Radec.\n\nFollowing the Cedar Fire in October 2003, utility poles and wires fell down on the highway, and the Cuyamaca area was heavily damaged. The next year, part of SR 79 from the western junction of SR 78 to Engineers Road near Lake Cuyamaca was renamed the Firefighter Steven Rucker Memorial Highway, after the firefighter from Novato who died while volunteering to fight the wildfire in Wynola. The City of Temecula proposed the construction of a four-lane road from State Route 79 that would bypass the city in 2005, though several obstacles to the plan, including aesthetic concerns and objections from the nearby Pechanga tribe, were noted. In February 2013, the part of SR 79 through Winchester was being widened to be four lanes. The project is now complete.\n\nDue to increased traffic congestion through the San Jacinto Valley, there are plans to realign SR 79 to a new four-lane (eventually six-lane) limited-access expressway, spanning approximately 12 miles from East Newport Road to the southern end of the current divided highway portion at Ramona Expressway. The selected alignment will have access points (likely interchanges) at Domenigoni Parkway, Grand Avenue, SR 74 (Florida Avenue), Esplanade Avenue/Warren Road, Cottonwood Avenue, Sanderson Avenue, and Ramona Expressway, with additional grade separations at Stetson Avenue and Devonshire Avenue. An additional interchange with Mid County Parkway will be built upon completion of that project. Construction has yet to begin, and the project is only partially funded. An estimated completion date for this project is around 2040.\n\n"}

He later received a B.A. in history (\"magna cum laude\") from the Columbia University School of General Studies in 1961.\n\nHe began his career with \"The Wall Street Journal\" in the 1950s, covering business and social issues, including the early years of the Civil Rights Movement. He served as a journalist and speechwriter in the United States Army from 1957 to 1959, and returned to the \"Wall Street Journal\" after completing his service. In 1961, he went to work at NBC News, becoming the lifelong friend of a then young Tom Brokaw. While at NBC, Apple reported for the \"Huntley-Brinkley Report\" and won an Emmy Award for his work. In the last of his 29 appearances on the Charlie Rose talk show, he said that the most satisfying time of his career was when he was reporting on the American civil rights movement.\n\nApple joined \"The New York Times\" in 1963 and over more than 30 years, contributed foreign correspondence from over 100 countries, including coverage of the Vietnam War – where his penetrating questioning helped expose the unreliability of the military briefings known as the Five O'Clock Follies – the Biafra crisis, the Iranian revolution, and the fall of Communist governments in the Soviet bloc. In addition, he served as the \"Times' \" bureau chief in Saigon, Lagos, Nairobi, London and Moscow.\n\nIn Vietnam, Apple distinguished himself as chief of the New York Times bureau and won many awards for his work. In a long article in 1967, \"The Making of a Stalemate,\" he exposed the failure of the U.S. military to make progress in the war after 2 1/2 years of fighting and with some 500,000 troops in the country. Nearly 40 years later it was revealed that one of the main sources for that influential story was Lt. Gen.

In 1966, he was nearly killed by friendly fire while covering a firefight at a village when a machine-gun bullet ripped through the back of his trousers and split his belt in half.\n\nTimothy Crouse profiled Apple in his book \"The Boys on the Bus\" about journalists covering the 1972 presidential campaign. Reporters \"recognized many of their own traits in him, grotesquely magnified. The shock of recognition frightened them. Apple was like them, only more blatant. He openly displayed the faults they tried to hide: the insecurity, the ambitiousness, the name-dropping\" and \"the weakness for powerful men.\"\n\nFrom 1993 to 1997, he was chief of The Times, Washington, D.C. bureau. He also served as the newspaper's National Political Correspondent in the 1970s and covered the 1972 presidential election.\n\nBeyond The Times and the \"Journal\", Apple has been published in many prominent magazines, including \"The Atlantic Monthly\", \"Esquire\", \"GQ\", and \"Gourmet\".\n\nHis first marriage to Edith Smith, a former vice-consul in Saigon, ended in divorce.\n\nHe married Betsey Pinckney Brown in 1982.

His granddaughter Jane Dillon (Ann Christy) is in love with Harold \"Speedy\" Swift (Harold Lloyd).\n\nSpeedy, an avid New York Yankees fan, is working at a soda shop. As well as doing his work, he takes frequent telephone calls during Yankees games and passes the line scores on to the kitchen staff by arranging food items in a display case (such as doughnuts for zeroes). But he loses the job after he is ordered to deliver some flowers and lets someone close a car door on them when he gets distracted by a display of baseball scores in a shop window.\n\nStreetcar magnate W.S. Wilton (Byron Douglas) comes to Pop's home to ask for his price to sell the car line, but Speedy spots a newspaper article and realizes that this is part of a plan to form a streetcar monopoly in the city. He surreptitiously raises Pop's written price from $10,000 to $70,000. Wilton angrily refuses and threatens to force Pop out instead.\n\nSpeedy is unworried about being unemployed; he is very much used to losing jobs and finding new ones. He and Jane go to Coney Island, where they greatly enjoy themselves despite various mishaps, such as Speedy ruining his suit jacket by leaning against wet paint. On the way home along with a stray dog that decided to follow them, Speedy proposes to Jane, but she will not marry him until her grandfather's affairs are settled.\n\nSpeedy is hired as a taxi driver, but for some time a series of mishaps prevents him from actually taking a passenger, and he antagonizes a policeman. Then, to his delight, Babe Ruth (playing himself) hails the cab to get to Yankee Stadium. Although terrified by Speedy's driving, he offers Speedy a ticket to the game; but the taxi owner is there, sees Speedy in the seats when he should be working, and fires him.\n\nAt the stadium, Speedy happens to overhear Wilton on the telephone. Wilton has learned that if Pop fails to operate the horsecar every 24 hours he will lose his right to the line, and orders goons to be sent to disrupt the operation. Speedy rushes home and arranges with small-business owners on the street to organize a defense. The goons are beaten off with the help of Speedy's dog, but return and steal the horse and car.\n\nAgain helped by his dog, Speedy finds out where the car has been taken and manages to steal it back. In a madcap chase scene, he brings it back across the city to Pop's tracks, stealing fresh horses, tricking police to avoid being stopped, and replacing a broken wheel with a manhole cover.\n\nWhen Wilton sees the horsecar in place, he agrees to meet Pop's price. Speedy says that Pop is a bit deaf and won't hear him until he offers $100,000. Wilton agrees, and Speedy suggests to Jane that they plan a visit to Niagara Falls by horsecar.\n\nDuring the Coney Island sequence, at one point Speedy gives the finger to himself while looking in a distorted mirror. This may be the earliest motion picture depiction of that gesture.\n\nAt the end of the scene where Speedy gives Babe Ruth a ride in his taxi, sharp-eyed viewers can look for an easily missed cameo appearance by Lou Gehrig, Ruth's famous New York Yankee teammate. Gehrig walks by the far side of Speedy's cab, looks directly at the camera through the taxi's window, and sticks out his tongue. Gehrig is on screen for about three seconds. Ruth and Gehrig's teammate, Bob Meusel, is also seen in the film batting after Ruth hits a home run at the game Harold attends. Meusel's at bat was not filmed for the movie but was taken from newsreel footage.\n\nTed Wilde, the director of the film, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director of a Comedy, which was used for only the 1st Academy Awards. He lost to Lewis Milestone, the director of \"Two Arabian Knights\" .\n\nLocation shooting for the Coney Island scenes cost a reported $150,000.\n\n\n\n"}

Formulated under the political guidance of Eduard Bernstein, August Bebel, and Karl Kautsky, it superseded the earlier Gotha Program.\n\nThe programme declared the imminent death of capitalism and the necessity of socialist ownership of the means of production. The Party intended to pursue these goals through legal political participation rather than by revolutionary activity. Kautsky argued that because capitalism, by its very nature, must collapse, the immediate task for socialists was to work for the improvement of workers' lives rather than for the revolution, which was inevitable.\nThe draft programme was criticised by Friedrich Engels for its opportunist, non-Marxist views on the state in a criticism he sent to Kautsky on 29 June 1891.\n\nKautsky wrote the official SPD commentary on the program in 1892, which was called \"The Class Struggle\". The simplified Marxism exemplified by \"The Class Struggle\" is sometimes referred to as 'vulgar Marxism' or the 'Marxism of the Second International'. The popular renderings of Marxism found in the works of Kautsky and Bebel were read and distributed more widely in Europe between the late 19th century and 1914 than Marx's own works. \"The Class Struggle\" was translated into 16 languages before 1914 and became the accepted popular summation of Marxist theory. This document came to be defined against 'orthodox' socialist theory before the October Revolution of 1917 caused a major split in the international socialist movement.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1823191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1823191", "title": "Kirby: Canvas Curse", "text": "Kirby: Canvas Curse\n\nKirby: Canvas Curse, known in Europe as Kirby: Power Paintbrush, is a platforming video game developed by HAL Laboratory, published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS and released in 2005. While \"Kirby: Canvas Curse\" is a platformer, it does not play like a traditional \"Kirby\" video game, as it uses the stylus exclusively. In 2014, Nintendo announced a Wii U sequel to the game titled \"Kirby and the Rainbow Curse\", released in 2015.\n\nOne day, a strange portal appears in the sky, and out of it comes a witch named Drawcia. Drawcia casts a spell over Dream Land, turning it into a world of paint. Upon fleeing back into the portal she came through, Kirby gives chase, eventually finding himself in Drawcia's also paint-themed world. The witch curses Kirby, turning him into a limbless ball. After Drawcia escapes, the Magical Paintbrush (Power Paintbrush in the European version) turns to the player to help Kirby. The player and Kirby set off to find and defeat Drawcia to restore Dream Land to its normal state. Along the way, Drawcia creates replicas of Kirby's oldest foes to slow him down. These include Paint Roller, Kracko, Kracko Jr., and King Dedede.\n\nUnlike most previous \"Kirby\" games, the player does not directly control Kirby with a directional pad, face buttons, or shoulder buttons. Instead, the player only uses the stylus and touch screen to control Kirby, who rolls around in ball form. The player can draw rainbow lines, which Kirby will roll on, or poke Kirby, to make him do a little speed dash. These rainbow paths can form ramps or bridges for Kirby to cross, or walls to protect him from enemy projectiles. Drawing paths depletes the player's rainbow ink supplies, which recharges slowly while Kirby is in the air or on a path, but quickly when Kirby is on the ground. These paths eventually disappear, even faster if another path is painted. However, the player must either tap on Kirby to cause him to dash forward onto the path, or have the path created directly underneath him, causing him to automatically move forward on it.\n\nThe player can use the stylus to stun enemies by tapping on it. Afterwards, the player can either allow Kirby to roll into the enemy with his own momentum or by dashing to defeat the enemy. Defeating certain kinds of enemies by either dashing into them or touching them while stunned causes Kirby to gain one of several special abilities, which may be used at any time by tapping Kirby himself. This special ability replaces the dash. Once an ability is obtained, the only way Kirby can lose it is either by tapping a button in the bottom left corner or by being damaged. This is also the only way to get a different ability from the one Kirby already has.\n\n\"Kirby: Canvas Curse\" spans eight worlds, with all but one having three levels. A variety of themes are used throughout the game. These themes range from a volcanic area to a frozen area. The objective of every level in the game is to reach a rainbow-colored doorway. As the player makes progress in the game, the environmental hazards become far more plentiful. In one level, the player must maneuver Kirby quickly enough to avoid getting defeated by an ever-rising body of lava. Occasionally, Kirby will come across a barrier, which prevents the paint lines from being created inside of them, forcing Kirby to do nothing but roll, dash, and use a power (if applicable). Portions of these levels can be played in Rainbow Run mode, where speed and amount of paint used are key factors in the player's success.\n\nAt the end of each world except for world seven, Kirby must face a boss. In worlds one through six, the first time he completes them, he must face one of each boss - Paint Roller, Kracko, or King Dedede (all of whom must be battled twice). With the exception of the final boss, all bosses are mini-game based. The boss of world eight is the main villain of \"Kirby: Canvas Curse\", Drawcia Sorceress. Drawcia starts out in her standard form. Upon defeat, she will transform into a large ball of paint with five eyes and a mouth called Drawcia Soul.\n\n\"Kirby: Canvas Curse\" features special collectibles called Medals, which can be used to unlock secret features in the game, such as characters, sound tests, and alternate paint colors. There are three ways for the player to find a Medal. The first way is to get one in one of the main levels. Each level has three Medals to be found, all of which can be seen on the map if Kirby is in the correct area and close enough. It is often required that the player do something particularly challenging to acquire one, and the difficulty of the challenge is respective to the difficulty of the level. Another way is through Rainbow Run mode. In it, Kirby must complete a portion of one of the main levels, with the objective being either getting through it as fast as possible, or getting through it while trying to use as little paint as possible. Reaching a certain peg awards Kirby with one or more Medals. The third way is by defeating the lesser bosses outside of the main game with an A Rank on the third level in each of the boss battles.\n\n\"Kirby: Canvas Curse\" received \"favorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of one nine, two eights, and one nine for a total of 34 out of 40.\n\n1UP called it \"genuinely excellent\", saying that \"it's a welcome reinvention of gaming's most overplayed genre\" and later concluded that \"Canvas Curse\" is \"the DS's first great game\". The stylus gameplay has also been noted, with IGN hailing it as \"incredibly innovative\", GameSpy saying it is \"quite rewarding\", and GameSpot calling it \"a satisfying part of the gameplay.\" \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" ranked it the 96th best game available on Nintendo platforms. On the other hand, \"Play\"s editor disagreed, noting that \"it's innovative... but for me, that's not enough.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" gave it a very favorable review and called it \"tremendous fun\". \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" gave it four stars out of five, saying that \"Kirby's use of touch-screen technology provides a fresh and engaging game.\" However, \"Detroit Free Press\" gave it three stars out of four, stating that \"there is some nice innovation, such as levels that are completely black until Kirby bumps into lanterns that put off light. And as we all know, in dark places like this, it's good to have a friend.\"\n\n\"Kirby: Canvas Curse\" was the third best-selling game in Japan during its week of release at 75,365 units sold. \"Famitsu\" annual sales for the region show the game sold 276,418 copies by the end of 2005. According to NPD Group, the game sold just under 80,000 copies in North America during the month of June 2005. The following month, it was the top-selling DS game in the region at 50,000 copies.\n\n"}

It is located in the northern half of the Brazilian state of Roraima and is the largest in that country and one of the world's largest, with an area of and a perimeter of about .\n\nThe area includes two major natural landscapes: plains occupied by a type of vegetation similar to that of \"cerrado\" and steep mountains covered with thick rainforest. \nThe Pacaraima Mountains in the north of the territory separate Brazil from Venezuela and Guyana.\nThe territory contains the Monte Roraima National Park, created in 1989.\n\nRaposa Serra do Sol indigenous territory is home to about 20,000 people, most of them Macuxi. Other peoples represented there are the Wapixanas, Ingaricós, Taurepangs and Patamonas, as well as non-indigenous farmers.\nThe inhabitants of the reserve vary wildly in language and degree of cultural contact with the mainstream Brazilian culture. The Macuxis have a good degree of contact with the local non-indigenous society, while others are still outside its reach. Most of the Indians of the reserve cannot speak Portuguese. Most of the contact the Indians have had with the mainstream society has been through FUNAI researchers, missionaries, military men, gold diggers and farmers, who grow rice in the damp plains.\n\nThe presence of non-indigenous inhabitants in the reserve is not recent, but has seen a boom recently, since the reserve was proposed, because the Brazilian government usually refunds \"bona fide\" settlers for the land they forsake.\n\nThe creation of Raposa/Serra do Sol has been the subject of sharp controversy ever since it was first proposed in 1993, for a series of reasons including concerns of national security and territorial integrity. After being identified as an Indian homeland by FUNAI, it was mapped during the Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration but was only accepted formally by president Luís Inácio Lula da Silva in 2005. In May 2009 the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that the reserve should be inhabited only by indigenous people, and an operation began to remove the remaining non-indigenous inhabitants.\n\nConcerns about the reserve started back in the 1970s, when Brazilian indigenist Orlando Villas-Boas gave a now-famous interview in which he said that the creation of Indian reserves close to border areas was a risk to the integrity of the Brazilian territory and that the action of missionaries in Brazil sought to build up national conscience among the most numerous indigenous peoples, like the Macuxi and the Yanomami, with the covert goal of establishing independent or semi-independent national entities and fragmenting the control of the Amazon jungle. The fact that the Raposa/Serra do Sol lies right along the border with Guyana and Venezuela adds to this preoccupation.\n\nAnother major source of concern was that, after the creation of the reserve, the state of Roraima - still the least populous and the most scarcely populated Brazilian state - would have more than 54% of its area occupied by Indian reserves or national parks, which was seen by the locals as an obstacle to the state's present economic boom. Most of the rice crops of the Brazilian northern region are from within the limits of Raposa/Serra do Sol and the creation of the reserve would reduce Roraima's GDP severely. Besides large parts of other municipalities, there are an entire town, Uiramutã, and four non-Indian villages inside the territory of the reserve.\n\nThe Monte Roraima National Park existed only on paper until 2001, when the United Nations provided money to implement and manage parks in Brazil.\nThe indigenous people became concerned when the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) began to implement the management plan.\nThis included erecting a headquarters building, and potentially removing the indigenous Ingarikó and Macushi people from the park.\nOn 15 April 2005 the area was completely assigned to Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI: National Indian Foundation) through the \"dual affectation\" legal device create by the federal government with recognition of the Raposa Serra do Sol Indigenous Territory.\nUnder the decree of 15 April 2005 the boundaries of the Raposa Serra do Sol Indigenous Territory were ratified and Monte Roraima National Park was made Union public property with the roles of both maintaining the constitutional rights of the Indians and conserving the environment. In December 2008 the Supreme Federal Court issued a high-profile decision in favour of the continued territorial integrity of Raposa Serra do Sol. Non-indigenous rice farmers had protested their deportation from the TI, arguing that the reserve undermined Brazil's national integrity and the state's economic development, and proposing that it be broken up. The ruling established a legal precedent that affected more than 100 similar cases that were before the Supreme Court at the time.\n\n"}

He was also a research fellow and later a policy analyst with the Cato Institute from 1982 to 1984. Childs's most visible public role was as lead book reviewer for Laissez Faire Books in which he produced a number of memorable short essays. He held this position from 1984 until his death.\n\nChilds counted among his early influences Ayn Rand, Ludwig von Mises, Rose Wilder Lane and Robert LeFevre.\n\nIn his essay \"An Open Letter to Ayn Rand\", Childs rejected Objectivism as being true libertarianism, asserting that the establishment of government is in violation of self-ownership and the non-aggression principle. In the 1960s, Childs endorsed anarcho-capitalism, but he later expressed doubts about anarchism. In the 1960s, Ayn Rand wrote an essay entitled \"America's Persecuted Minority: Big Business\". Childs responded with an essay entitled \"Big Business and the Rise of American Statism\", writing: \"To a large degree it has been and remains big businessmen who are the fountainheads of American statism\". In 1982, Childs gave a lecture at the Libertarian Party of New York convention on the origins and consequences of Ronald Reagan's foreign policy and stated his opposition to an interventionist foreign policy.\n\nChilds was born in Buffalo, New York on January 4, 1949. After graduating high school, he enrolled at the State University of New York at Buffalo with the intention of eventually becoming a college professor. While there, he was offered a full scholarship to attend Rampart College in Larkspur, Colorado, an unaccredited college established by Robert LeFevre to educate students on libertarian views. However, LeFevre's project collapsed soon after Childs arrived and by the fall of 1968 was back at SUNY Buffalo.\n\nFor many years, Childs suffered from difficulties due to obesity. In later years when he lived in New York City, he sometimes weighed over 400 pounds and rarely left his apartment. Childs went to the Pritikin Center in Miami, Florida to take part in a weight loss program. While there, he fell and was taken to a local hospital, where he died on May 22, 1992 at the age of 43.\n\nAfter his death, libertarian scholar Tom G. Palmer wrote: \"Roy Childs was one of the finer members of a generation of radical thinkers who worked successfully to revive the tradition of classical liberalism [...] and who dared to launch a frontal challenge to the twentieth-century welfare state. [...] His writings exercised a powerful influence on a generation of young classical liberal thinkers\".\n\nThe Cato Institute named its in-house library which contained many volumes from his collection after Childs. His personal papers are in an archive at Stanford University. The Center for Independent Thought offers a Roy A. Childs, Jr. Fund for Independent Scholars which supports non-academic classical liberal writers.\n\nChilds wrote essays and book reviews which were collected posthumously into anthologies:\n\n\n"}

His father was the band director at Bertha High School, Bertha MN that Herseth attended, where Herseth got his first trumpet. He then went on to learn from James Greco during the summer of 1937 at the first high school state band camp that Gerald Prescott held at the University of Minnesota. Prescott had heard him play in a regional competition and invited him to play solo cornet in his summer band. Herseth graduated from Luther College in Iowa with a degree in mathematics prior to serving as a musician with the U.S. Navy during World War II. After the war, Herseth studied with Boston Symphony Orchestra trumpeters Marcel LaFosse (second trumpet) and Georges Mager (principal trumpet) at the New England Conservatory of Music.\n\nIn a book by Louis Davidson, Herseth lists a few of the players he admired and whose playing most influenced his. They include Louis Davidson, Harry Glantz, and Maurice Andre. Herseth also admired the Swedish tenor Jussi Björling and Frank Sinatra.\n\nHis ancestors came from Norway, so in 1977 he visited Norway to see the places where his relatives lived in the municipality of Stange in Hedmark County.\n\nHerseth was widely regarded as one of the greatest orchestral trumpeters of his generation.\n\nAs the principal trumpet of the Chicago Symphony for 53 years, Herseth performed under Bruno Walter, George Szell, Eugene Ormandy, Leonard Bernstein, James Levine, Claudio Abbado, and many other prominent orchestral conductors. His tenure in the orchestra spanned the time of 6 different CSO music directors - Artur Rodziński (1947-1948), Rafael Kubelik (1950-1953), Fritz Reiner (1953-1962), Jean Martinon (1963-1968), Sir Georg Solti (1969-1991), and Daniel Barenboim (1991-2006).\n\nHerseth's tenure as principal trumpet spanned the Reiner years, during which the orchestra rose to prominence, due in part to the powerful and precise sound of its brass section. As explained by the Telegraph in London on September 18, 2009, \"The orchestra's rise to fame began with the great Fritz Reiner in the Fifties, but it was during the 22-year reign of the fierce Hungarian Georg Solti that the orchestra became the brawny yet subtle precision instrument that it is today, famed especially for its noble and stupendously powerful brass sound.\" A Smithsonian profile of Herseth, published September 1, 1994, offered this description: \"The Chicago has long been recognized as one of the world's great orchestras, and Adolph Sylvester Herseth has had a major role in the evolution of its distinctive sound.\" As described in the Chicago Sun-Times, July 22, 2001, \"For decades Herseth's rich, golden tone and powerful yet expressive playing were a cornerstone of the fabled 'Chicago Sound.'\" That brass sound drew worldwide attention to the CSO, and propelled the great American orchestra's reputation around the globe.\" According to an entry on the Chicago History Museum's online history of the city, the CSO's \"unmistakable sound and high standard of performance helped define the Chicago Symphony Orchestra as a world class institution. It also made Chicago an international center for the study of brass instrument performance.\"\n\nRegular concert-goers knew him not only by his golden sound, but also by sight; as long-time Chicago Tribune critic John von Rhein wrote in his farewell piece, \"He was the man whose face would turn radish-red when he was scaling the trumpet stratosphere or tossing off a rapid scale passage. Where he found the huge volume of air needed to make a notoriously recalcitrant brass instrument soar like that, Herseth wasn't saying. That was part of the Bud Mystique.\" \n\nHerseth retired in 2001. The position he occupied is now named after him - The Adolph Herseth Principal Trumpet Chair. He died at his home in Oak Park on April 13, 2013, at the age of 91.\n\n"}
