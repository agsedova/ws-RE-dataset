She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district, numbered as the 12th District from 2008 to 2013, includes the northern two-thirds of San Mateo County and the southwest quarter of San Francisco. She represents much of the territory that had been represented by her political mentor, Leo Ryan. In 1978, while working as his aide, Speier survived five gunshot wounds she received when Ryan was assassinated during the Jonestown massacre.\n\nSpeier was a member of the California State Senate, representing parts of San Francisco and San Mateo counties. On April 8, 2008, she won the special election for the vacated United States House of Representatives seat of the late Congressman Tom Lantos.\n\nA Caltrain Express locomotive is named in her honor.\n\nSpeier was born in 1950 in San Francisco, and grew up in an apolitical family, the daughter of Nancy (née Kanchelian) and Manfred \"Fred\" Speier (). Her mother, who was born in Fresno of Armenian descent, lost most of her extended family in the Armenian Genocide, while her father was an emigrant from Germany. He was the son of a Jewish father and a Catholic mother. Speier took Jacqueline as her confirmation name after Jackie Kennedy. She is a graduate of Mercy High School in Burlingame. She earned a B.A. degree from the University of California, Davis, and a J.D. degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in 1976.\n\nSpeier's first marriage was to Dr. Steven Sierra, an emergency-room doctor, in 1987. In 1988, they had a son Jackson Kent, while she was serving as a member of the California State Assembly. Sierra died in a car accident in 1994 at the age of 53. At the time, Speier was two months pregnant with their second child, a daughter she named Stephanie.\n\nIn 2001, Speier married Barry Dennis, an investment consultant.\n\n \nSpeier entered politics by serving as a congressional staffer for Congressman Leo Ryan. Speier was part of his November 1978 fact-finding mission organized to investigate allegations of human-rights abuses by Jim Jones and his Peoples Temple followers, almost all of whom were American citizens who had moved to Jonestown, Guyana, with Jones in 1977 and 1978.\n\nSeveral Peoples Temple members ambushed the investigative team and others boarding the plane to leave Jonestown on November 18. Five people died, including Congressman Ryan. While trying to shield herself from rifle and shotgun fire behind small airplane wheels with other team members, Speier was shot five times and waited 22 hours before help arrived. That same day, over 900 remaining members of the Peoples Temple died in Jonestown and Georgetown in a mass murder-suicide.\n\nSpeier's political career began with an unsuccessful run to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Congressman Ryan (the seat she holds now). She lost the Democratic primary to another former Ryan staffer, G. W. \"Joe\" Holsinger. He lost the special election to the Republican candidate Bill Royer, San Mateo County Supervisor, who would serve the remaining 21 months of the term before losing to Tom Lantos.\n\nSpeier won her first election in 1980, when she ran for the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors and defeated a 20-year incumbent. At the time, she was the youngest person ever elected to the board. She was reelected in 1984, and was later selected as chairwoman.\n\nIn 1986, midway through her second term on the Board of Supervisors, Speier ran for the California State Assembly from a district in northern San Mateo County. She won by a few hundred votes. She was reelected four more times, the last time as the nominee of both the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nState law prevented Speier from running for reelection to the Assembly in 1996, but in 1998 she was elected to the California State Senate. In 2002, she was elected to a second term with 78.2% of the vote. As a state senator, Speier was instrumental in securing $127 million funding to start the \"Baby Bullet\" express service for Caltrain, for which the commuter rail agency named a new locomotive (no. 925) after her. Speier also focused on representing consumer rights. Senator Speier was termed out of the California State Senate in 2006. During her last term, she served as assistant president pro tempore of the California State Senate.\n\nIn 2006, Speier ran in the Democratic primary for Lieutenant Governor of California against insurance commissioner John Garamendi and state senator Liz Figueroa. In the June 6, 2006 elections, Garamendi defeated Speier in a close race. Garamendi received 42.5%, Speier received 39.7%, and Figueroa received the remaining 17.8% of the vote.\n\nSpeier endorsed Hillary Clinton's bid for president.\n\nOn January 13, 2008, Speier announced she was running in the Democratic primary for the 12th District, Ryan's old district. The seat was being vacated by 14-term incumbent and fellow Democrat Tom Lantos, who announced on January 2, 2008, that he was not seeking re-election. Speier had spent much of 2007 building support to challenge Lantos in the Democratic primary.\n\nOn January 17, 2008, Lantos endorsed Speier as his successor. She also picked up endorsements from Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, Congressman Mike Thompson and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.\n\nLantos died February 11, 2008. Speier won a special primary election on April 8, 2008 to fill the remainder of his term, which ended in January 2009. She won an outright majority, avoiding a runoff that would have been held on June 3, coinciding with the regular primary election. She was elected to a full term in November with 75 percent of the vote and has been reelected three more times with no substantive opposition.\n\nOn July 11, 2008, Speier introduced her first bill, the Gasoline Savings and Speed Limit Reduction Act, which would set a national speed limit of 60 mph in urban areas and 65 mph on less-populated stretches of highway.\n\nIn January 2016, during a speech on the House floor Speier announced that she would introduce legislation requiring schools to disclose disciplinary proceedings of faculty.\n\nOn August 16, 2017, Speier advocated for the use of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to remove President Trump from office because of erratic behavior and mental instability \"that place the country in great danger\", following his response to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and dealings with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.\n\nIn September 2016, Speier proposed a bill to stop sexual abuse and harassment of women in STEM fields known as the Federal Funding Accountability for Sexual Harassers Act.\n\nOn October 27, 2017, Speier, as part of the #MeToo movement, posted a video sharing her experience with sexual harassment on Capitol Hill. She said that when she was in her 20s a chief of staff for Representative Leo Ryan, \"kissed me and stuck his tongue in my mouth.\" Speier called the United States Congress a breeding ground for a hostile work environment and she called for more sexual harassment training.\n\nSpeier and Mississippi Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson have been seeking to prohibit sleeping in United States Congress offices.\n\nSpeier is a critic of the F35 Joint Strike Fighter Program. She has been quoted in CNN: \"To continue pouring money into building planes that have ejector seat issues, cyber vulnerabilities, flawed aerodynamics, maintenance problems, an inability to fly at full speed while using weapons, and overheating issues is borderline malfeasance.\"\n\nSpeier supports legal abortion. When she took the National Political Awareness Test in 2002, she answered, \"Abortions should always be legally available.\" The organization NARAL Pro-Choice America rated Speier as 100% on interest group ratings because she supported the choice of abortion in her voting for legislation. Also, in 2008 the Planned Parenthood Organization gave Speier a 100% on her actions regarding abortion. In a speech on the House floor on February 17, 2011, Speier said that she herself had undergone an emergency D&E procedure when complications developed in a wanted pregnancy.\n\nSpeier believes in stricter gun control. According to her answers on the NPAT (National Political Awareness Test) she would like to require safety locks on all guns and background checks on prospective buyers as well as ban certain guns (other than for hunting) and strengthen state restrictions on buying and owning guns. Gun Owners of America gave her an \"F\" grade and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Jack Berman Advocacy Center gave her a 100% rating. The National Rifle Association (NRA) and Gun Owners of California also gave Speier a low grade on gun rights.\n\nSpeier is concerned for the protection of the environment and wants to preserve the health of this planet. She lists as evidence the decline of salmon on the West Coast as proof of global warming. Speier believes global warming poses a growing danger and negatively affects the environment. When she spoke to the House on the subject of global warming and the environment, she expressed a desire \"to craft a bipartisan and commonsense energy plan that makes polluters pay, provides for middle-class energy tax credits, and creates a new industry and lots of good, clean, green jobs\". Speier is working to improve energy legislation with the Clean Air Rebate Act of 2009, the Home Star Act and the American Clean Energy and Security Act.\n\nSpeier introduced legislation to enhance information sharing between the Transportation Security Administration and participating mass transit agencies in high-risk jurisdictions. The goal of this expanded relationship would be to thwart terrorist attacks against high-profile transit targets.\n\nSpeier supports same-sex marriage. She is a member of the LGBT Equality Caucus.\n\nSpeier was one of 32 members of Congress to co-sign a letter of October 8, 2015, to the TSA requesting a reform in screening policies and procedures for transgender travelers.\n\nIn March 2016, Speier introduced the \"Closing the Pre-Paid Mobile Device Security Gap Act\" (H.R. 4886) to force purchasers of prepaid mobile devices or SIM cards to provide identification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This episode marks the final appearance of Loretta, until the season 7 episode, \"Love, Blactually\". In the episode, Cleveland's wife Loretta cheats on him with Quagmire, due to Cleveland's \"lack of passion\" and \"not being a real man\". With Cleveland separating from Loretta, this episode lays much of the foundation for \"The Cleveland Show\". The episode features guest performances from Jane Carr, Randy Crenshaw, Miriam Flynn, Denis Martell, Mark Peredes and Fred Tatasciore, as well as several recurring guest performers for the series.\n\nPeter invites his friends on his fishing boat for a party at sea. While Quagmire is fishing, he catches a fish that lands in Loretta's shirt. She invites him to reach in and grab it, which after a moment of hesitation he does. While Quagmire's hand is between her breasts, Cleveland approaches and mentions the snacks Peter has supplied, serenely saying hello to Quagmire before walking away.\n\nWhen partaking in charades with his friends, Joe falls overboard and nearly drowns, but is saved and revived by CPR. The Griffins take a CPR class and Peter receives a card for it, but when he harasses a man in a harmless car crash under the pretenses of CPR, his card is revoked and he confides in his disappointment with Brian.\n\nUpon hearing Loretta scream at her house, Peter and Brian quickly check and see her having sex on the couch with another man which they do not realize is Quagmire, as they only see the back of his body with a tattoo of a phone number on his buttocks. They initially decide not to tell anyone about Loretta's adultery but do so after literally doing everything in the world, which makes Quagmire nervous and afraid that Cleveland would find out. Peter then tells Cleveland at the Drunken Clam what he and Brian saw in an obnoxious manner, but Cleveland seems indifferent. When he confronts Loretta about it, she states it was because she needed passion and that he \"wasn't acting like a real man\". Cleveland apologizes for his actions, but Loretta sees him as pathetic for doing so and kicks him out of their house. As Cleveland is staying over at the Griffin house, Peter and Brian visit Quagmire for help on finding the man who slept with Loretta, but realize that it was him after seeing the same tattoo from before. Despite the two telling Cleveland who it was exactly, he remains indifferent by the revelation.\n\nLois tells Cleveland that Loretta wants him to express his feelings: that women sometimes want men to be strong and stand up for them. Peter then tries to get his friend to feel some passion by taking him to a wrestling match featuring Randy Savage, but it affects Peter much more than Cleveland. He then puts on a Quagmire mask and wrestles with Brian (who is unwillingly wearing a Loretta mask) on the ground. This method finally yields results: Cleveland becomes enraged and vows to kill Quagmire.\n\nPeter realizes that his plan has worked too well and tries to protect Quagmire by hiding him at Mayor West's mansion. West's lunacy soon proves too much even for Quagmire and he returns home and calls Cleveland to apologize. Cleveland appears and chases Quagmire around his house wielding a baseball bat. Despite finally having Quagmire cowering and at his mercy, Cleveland realizes that he is unable to hurt another living person, no matter how badly they have hurt him and Quagmire apologizes to Cleveland for sleeping with Loretta. After Peter brings Loretta over, she and Cleveland end their marriage via a divorce, with the latter believing that he deserves better.\n\nSometime afterwards at Quagmire's place, he and Cleveland decide to repair their broken friendship through a friendly sparring match in boxing.\n\nThis episode was written by Mike Henry and his brother, Patrick Henry, and directed by former \"Futurama\" director James Purdum during the course of the fourth production season. According to the DVD commentary for this episode, Loretta was written out of \"Family Guy\" because her voice actor, Alex Borstein (who also voices Lois and other female characters), was apparently tired of voicing Loretta. However, Loretta would later appear one last time in Season 7's \"Love, Blactually\" before being killed off.\n\nIn addition to the regular cast, actress Jane Carr, actor Randy Crenshaw, actress Miriam Flynn, professional chef Emeril Lagasse, voice actor Denis Martell, voice actor Mark Peredes and voice actor Fred Tatasciore guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Ralph Garman, writer David A. Goodman, writer Danny Smith, actress Jennifer Tilly, and writer John Viener made minor performances in the episode. Recurring guest cast members Mike Henry, Patrick Warburton, and Adam West also appeared in the episode, portraying the characters of Cleveland Brown, Joe Swanson, and Mayor West respectively.\n\n\nWith Fox in second place among adults 18 to 49 years old, this episode gained a total of 8.35 million viewers. Kim Voynar of TV Squad wrote a favorable review, saying \"This episode of Family Guy was just chock-full of the tasteless and tacky moments that make the show so popular.\"\n\nThe \"You Have AIDS\" sequence, in which Peter and a barbershop quartet dance, in musical revue fashion, around the bed of a man with end-stage AIDS, delivering the patient's diagnosis in song, drew protests from several AIDS service organizations.\n\n"}

{"id": "2070267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070267", "title": "Parker Center", "text": "Parker Center\n\nParker Center was the headquarters for the Los Angeles Police Department from 1954 until October 2009 and was located in downtown LA at 150 N. Los Angeles St. Often called \"The Glass House\", the building was named for former LAPD chief William H. Parker. Originally called the Police Administration Building (PAB) (or Police Facilities Building), groundbreaking for the center began on December 30, 1952, and construction was completed in 1955. The architect was Welton Becket. The building combined police facilities that had been located throughout the Civic Center area. The location was previously home to the Olympic Hotel.\n\nOn July 16, 1966, Parker suffered a fatal heart attack. Soon afterward, the Los Angeles City Council renamed the building \"Parker Center\". The building was one of the sites of unrest during the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed a not-guilty verdict for the four police officers involved in the Rodney King incident.\n\nWith time, the Parker Center became outdated and was in need of expensive seismic retrofits. After considering a number of downtown sites for a new facility, the city council selected a property directly south of City Hall, Caltrans' former Los Angeles headquarters. Ground was broken for the new building in January 2007, which was dedicated on October 24, 2009.\n\nBoth the Old Parker Center and the new headquarters have heliports. The Old Parker Center heliport is marked with a number \"5\", while the new center is inscribed with an \"H\".\n\nThe LAPD Robbery and Homicide Division still operated from an annex of the Old Parker Center.\n\nOn January 15, 2013, the City of Los Angeles permanently closed Parker Center. In 2014 the City Department of Public Works and the Bureau of Engineering recommended razing the now vacant Parker Center in favor of building a 27-story tower in its place. The razing would proceed on a floor-by-floor process, eliminating the need for wrecking balls or dynamiting. Construction of the new building would start in 2016 and last 18–24 months, with completion anticipated in 2018.\n\nOn January 29, 2015, a city panel, The Cultural Heritage Commission, nominated Parker Center for historical status. The final decision rests with the city council, which has three months to consider it. A tentative date for the ruling was set for April 28, 2015. However, the ruling was postponed until May 5, 2015. The deadline for the City Council to grant Parker Center landmark status expires on May 13, 2015. If a decision is not made by that date, the nomination fails. During the council meeting held on May 5, 2015, the council claimed to have \"lost jurisdiction over this item\" due to a technical error and did not act in time (within a 105-day time limit). Committee chairman and 14th District Councilman José Huizar thus reminded the council of the May 13th deadline and stated his forthcoming intention to nominate Parker Center as a historical landmark. This presupposes that someone unilaterally seeks to reapply for nomination, which Huizar encouraged the Cultural Heritage Commission and Department of City Planning to do. He also presented a new motion, recommending against the razing of the building, instead preserving it and \"build[ing] an adjacent tower taller than the one analyzed in the project's already complete environmental impact report\". The city's Office of Historic Resources will submit another nomination for the Parker Center and officials will review it and proceed with the matter from there. The case was issued case number \"15-0127\". Following these developments, a group of civic leaders and land-use experts convened in May 2015 to discuss the future of Parker Center. They considered whether the former City of LA police headquarters should be preserved, and came to a consensus that Los Angeles’ 1997 Civic Center Master Plan requires updating, with some of the panel members suggesting that parts of the Parker Center could be preserved while other sections could be razed. \n\nIn August 2015, it was reported that the discussions regarding the Parker Center had expanded and now revolved not just the future of the building itself, but also what should be done with surrounding areas and the district on a whole. This suggested the possibility of an alternative location for the proposed office space buildings intended to be erected on the plot currently inhabited by the Parker Center. As of September 2015, three options were considered for the Parker Center.\n\n\nIn August 2016, the Parker Center building was threatened by demolition once again. A report from the Bureau of Engineering revealed a proposal to build a new municipal office building on the existing site of Parker Center. Given the threat of demolition, the Cultural Heritage Commission quickly mobilized another attempt the following month to award the Parker Center with a landmark status, after having failed to meet the deadline to do so during the preceding year. While the city reviews the building's nomination for landmark status, the Bureau of Engineering's proposed demolition project will also be reviewed by Public Works and Budget and Finance committees. Los Angeles Conservancy expects those committees to provide their respective recommendations by early 2017.\n\nHowever, in December 2016 the city Bureau of Engineering once again recommended razing the building, saying that tearing down the structure and creating the new high-rise would cost $514 million. The city Bureau of Engineering claimed that the preservation and smaller new edifice option would cost $621 million (both plans would have roughly the same amount of office space). The city Bureau of Engineering's timetable suggested securing approvals by February 2017.\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council, on March 24, 2017, voted unanimously to approve a proposal to demolish Parker Center, and replace it with an office tower that would consolidate offices of city employees. The above ground demolition of Parker Center was completed on July 15, 2019.\n\nParker Center appears in many episodes of the television drama \"Dragnet\", beginning with the fifth season in 1955. It also appears in several establishing shots for the \"Perry Mason\" TV series between 1958 and 1966. It appeared in several episodes (seasons 3, 4 & 10) of \"Columbo\". The NBC drama \"Hunter\" also used the Parker Center in the sixth and seventh seasons. Parker Center is also the location of the Priority Homicide Division, and later, Major Crimes on the television series \"The Closer\".\n\nThe building is also featured as one of the main locations in \"\", the fourth installment of the \"Police Quest\" series, a 1993 PC video game by Sierra Entertainment.\n\nParker Center was also featured in the 1970-set 2014 film Inherent Vice.\n\nParker Center is often mentioned in the novels of the Harry Bosch series written by Michael Connelly and the Shane Scully series written by Stephen J. Cannell. Parker Center and its closure is also mentioned in the Joseph Wambaugh novel \"Hollywood Hills\".\n\nParker Center also appears in the 1983 movie \"Blue Thunder\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2070268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070268", "title": "Iron Acton", "text": "Iron Acton\n\nIron Acton is a village, civil parish and former manor in South Gloucestershire, England. The village is about west of Yate and about northeast of the centre of Bristol. The B4058 road used to pass through the village but now by-passes it just to the north.\n\nThe \"iron\" part of the toponym originates from the iron that used to be mined near the village. \"Acton\" is derived from the Old English for \"farm (or village) with oak trees\". Still today there is an oak wood in the village beside the River Frome.\n\nThe civil parish also includes the smaller villages of Latteridge and Engine Common.\n\nThe manor of Iron Acton was held by the \"de Acton\" family, which took its name from the manor, and which expired in the male line on the death of John IV de Acton in 1362. His heir to Iron Acton became the descendant of his aunt Matilda (or Maud) de Acton, wife of Nicholas Poyntz (d.1311), feudal baron of Curry Mallet in Somerset. His descendants remained seated at Iron Acton for many generations and rose to prominence under the Tudor monarchs. Sir Nicholas Poyntz (1510-1556) was a prominent courtier during the latter part of the reign of King Henry VIII (1509-1547). His portrait drawing by Hans Holbein the Younger survives in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle. He added the east wing to the moated manor house of Acton Court, which addition was lavishly decorated to impress King Henry VIII, who with his second wife, Anne Boleyn, visited the house in 1535 during a tour of the West Country. Sir Robert Poyntz (d.1666), KB, MP for Gloucestershire and High Sheriff of Gloucestershire was the last in the male line of Poyntz of Iron Acton. He left no male progeny, only two daughters and co-heiresses, Grissel Poyntz and Margareta Poyntz.\n\nActon Court on Latteridge Lane is the historic manor house of the manor of Iron Acton. It is a Tudor building, with later restorations. In the 16th century Nicholas Poyntz added the east wing to the existing moated house, which addition was lavishly decorated to impress King Henry VIII, who with his second wife, Anne Boleyn, visited the house in 1535 during a tour of the West Country.\n\n\nThe Church of England parish church of Saint James the Less is Perpendicular Gothic and includes a clerestory, south aisle and south chapel, two-storey north porch and three-stage bell-tower. The nave and south arcade are of three bays. The nave, chancel and south chapel all have wagon roofs and there is a fan vault under the tower.\n\nThe church was restored in 1878–79 under the direction of the Gothic Revival architect Sir T. G. Jackson. The high altar has a reredos designed by F. C. Eden and made in about 1930. Behind the altar of the south chapel is a screen also designed by Eden.\n\nThe altar at the east end of the south aisle forms the focal point of the so-called Poyntz Chapel, which is not a separate chamber or structure. This is not to be confused with the Poyntz Chapel (formally termed \"Chapel of Jesus\") built by Sir Robert Poyntz (d.1520) within The Gaunt's Chapel, Bristol.\n\nAgainst the south wall is a 16th-century canopied tomb erected for a now unknown member of the Poyntz family. Of the three heraldic escutcheons comprised within the structure two are now blank and one bears the arms of the Acton family, from which the Poyntz's inherited the manor, \"A fess indented\". No inscription survives. The tomb was covered with many layers of whitewash until this was removed in the 19th-century restoration.\n\nDividing the Poyntz Chapel from the chancel are a pair of stone effigies set on slabs at floor level. The figures show an armed knight of the 14th century beside a female figure, possibly his lady, but perhaps of a slightly later date. The knight is believed to represent Sir John Poyntz (d. 21 Sept 1376), son of Sir Nicholas Poyntz (d. 12 July 1311) feudal baron of Curry Mallet, Somerset, by Matilda Acton, his 2nd wife, daughter and eventual heiress of Sir John Acton (d.1312) of Iron Acton. Buried beneath an incised slab set into the floor in the centre of the Poyntz Chapel is Robert Poyntz (1359–1439) between his two wives, 1st, Ann (family unknown), 2nd (marr. pre. 1389) Katherine FitzNichol, daughter of Sir Thomas FitzNichol of Hill, Gloucestershire, many times MP for Gloucestershire. Two other tombstones commemorate Florence Poyntz (d.1598) and Hugh Poyntz (d.1604), son of Sir Nicholas Poyntz (d.1585/6) by Margaret Stanley, daughter of Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby.\n\nThe Midland Railway opened its Thornbury Branch Line in 1872, including Iron Acton railway station to serve the village. The LMS closed the station in 1944 and it was demolished in the 1960s, but the line still carries one freight train per week between a stone quarry at Tytherington and the junction at Yate with the Birmingham and Gloucester line.\n\nA freight-only branch serving an iron mine in Frampton Cotterell joined the branch line at the station. This was closed in 1872 but a truncated section of the line served as a coal depot until closure on 10 June 1963.\n\nIron Acton station had a single platform and a large wooden station building. The remains of the platform survive, as does a crossing-keeper's cottage to the south of the station site.\n\nIron Acton hosts events throughout the year, including the annual May Day fair and horticultural show. Other events are organised by Acton Aid, a community organisation made up of men of the village who work together to benefit the parish of Iron Acton. Money is raised by holding social events such as the annual fireworks display and the Proms in the Meadows, and working with other parish organisations at the annual May Day fair. An example of such an event is the Victorian evening, during which local residents dressed up in Victorian era clothing for a fair on the street, which is accompanied by a brass band.\n\nThe village has its own football club, which played home games on the field behind the Rose and Crown public house on the High Street. The pub was closed and was turned into residential accommodation; Iron Acton F.C. now plays home games on Yate Common, Sunnyside Lane, Yate, away.\nThere are two pubs in the village and there is no shop in the main part of the village, there is however a garage on the outskirts of the village that is open 24/7\n\n\n"}

He was the first writer to translate the great epic Ramayana from Sanskrit to Nepali. Despite having other contemporary poets in the country during his time, he is revered and honored with the title of \"Adikavi\" (The First Poet) of the Nepali language.\n\nBhanubhakta Acharya was born on 29 Ashadh 1871 B.S. (July 13, 1814) in Tanahu district of Nepal in a village called Ramgha. Acharya was born to a Brahmin family and received education at home from his grandfather. His father Dhananjaya Acharya was a government official and was eldest of all brothers.\n\nBhanubhakta received his education of Sanskrit at his home and later in Varanasi.\n\nHe is honoured with the title of Adikavi for the contributions he made in the field of poetry and Nepali literature. Every year, his birthday is celebrated as Bhanu Jayanti(13 July) when various literary programs are organized to honour him.\n\nSouth Asian languages including the Nepali language were limited mostly to an oral medium of language dissemination at the time with little written context and literary influence. As most of the written texts of South Asia were dominated by Sanskrit, it was mostly inaccessible to the general populace. As the Brahmins were the caste who excelled as teachers, scholars and priests, the access to all of the religious scriptures and other literary works was only limited to them and few who also could receive education and understand Sanskrit. Many poets had written poems in Sanskrit while Acharya started to write in the Nepali language which not only popularized the language but also gained him acceptance from the Rana Rulers. Acharya's benevolence towards Ram’s heroic exploits brought in him an urgency to make his tale accessible to the people who spoke Nepali. Since most of the people did not understand the Sanskrit language, he translated the epic into the Nepali language. Preserving the lyrical narration style of Ramayana his translations are believed by scholars to carry the same lyrical essence \"Bhava and Marma\" that rather than sounding like a poem sounded more like a song without distorting the regional influence or the inner meaning of the Ramayana.\n\nHe did not receive any western education nor was familiar to foreign literature which kept his work and experiential journey original to the vernacular literary system and brought strong Nepali flavour to his works. The key features of his writings were simple yet strong with a sense of religion, sense of simplicity and the warmth of his country that not many of other poets had been able to be compared to.\nBelonging to a wealthy family, he never had any financial trouble and had an unremarkable life until he met a grass cutter who wanted to give something to the society so he could be remembered after death too. The grass cutters words were what inspired him to do something that would leave a mark in the society. He wrote two masterpieces in his life among which, one is the Bhanubhaktey Ramayan and the other is a letter he wrote in verse form to the Prime Minister while he was in prison. He was made a scapegoat and sent to prison due to some misunderstanding in signing the papers. In prison, his health deteriorated and he was given false hopes of being set free but his case was not even heard. So, he wrote a petition to the Prime Minister requesting his freedom, which later became one of his great works.\n\nHe not only won his freedom with his poem but was also given a bag of money (He wrote in the same language the then prime minister want to force the public to use). When he died in 1868, he did not know he would one day be one of the most revered poets of Nepal. His creation, however, was not published and he died without receiving credit for his contribution. His works were published by Motiram Bhatta in 1887 after he found the manuscript and took it to Benaras, India for printing. One of Acharya’s works is well known for its colourful, glowing praise of Kathmandu valley and its inhabitants. Although he is one of the most celebrated and revered poets of Nepal, his works are not as famous as other poets in the history of Nepali literature.\n\nBhanubhakta Acharya is revered and honoured with the title of \"Adikavi\" (The First-ever Poet) for the Nepali people of Nepal. Motiram Bhatta, first referred to him as Adikavi while writing Acharya’s biography in 1981. He clarifies that Acharya is not called Adikavi because he was the first poet in Nepal but he deserved the title as he was the first poet who wrote with an understanding of the marma (inner essence) of the poetry.\n\nBhanu Jayanti is a celebration of the birth anniversary of Bhanubhakta Acharya. It falls on the 29th day of the month of Ashad according to Nepali calendar. It is celebrated every year by the Government of Nepal and Nepalese people as well as by the Nepali speaking people around the world. cultural festival, prevalent among the Nepalese around the world in the remembrance of Bhanubhakta Acharya's birthday anniversary. It is generally celebrated in the 13th of July or the 29th day of the Nepali month of Ashadh.\n\nEvery year Bhanu Jayanti is celebrated as a mega event with literary seminars, and programs and amid a remarkable presence of Nepalese writers, novelists, and other literary figures/enthusiasts.\n\n\n"}

A driver who stops or slows down to let another vehicle through has yielded the right of way to that vehicle. In contrast, a stop sign requires each driver to stop completely before proceeding, whether or not other traffic is present. Particular regulations regarding appearance, installation, and compliance with the signs vary by some jurisdiction.\n\nWhile give way and yield essentially have the same meaning in this context, many countries have a clear preference of one term over the other. The following table lists which countries and territories use which term. This chart is based on official government usage in the English language and excludes indirect translations from other languages.\n\nA black triangle (within the standard down-arrow-shape of stop signs) was a symbol of \"stop for all vehicles\" from about 1925 in Germany. The triangular yield sign was used as early as 1938 when it was codified in Czechoslovakia in a blue-white variant without words and in 1939 in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia which adopted the current red-white variant. \nIn the United States, the first yield sign was erected in 1950 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, designed by Tulsa police officer Clinton Riggs;\n\nIn Australia, the Give Way sign evolved similarly to its counterpart in the United States. During the 1940s and 1950s, the sign was circular and yellow. In 1964, the sign changed to a red triangle. In the 1980s, the sign adopted its modern design and gained a counterpart for use at roundabouts.\n\nIn road signs in Ireland, the yield sign reads in most areas, although in Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking) areas the text is (\"yield way\") instead. Signs erected between 1962 and 1997 read , which remains legally permitted. Signs 1956–62 had a blank white interior.\n\nIn New Zealand, the original design also used the keystone shape as in the United States but used a black background with a red border. In the 1980s, the modern design was adopted. On sealed roads, the give way sign is always accompanied by a white line painted on the road to clarify the rule to road users even if the sign is obscured or missing.\n\nThe United Kingdom's Road Traffic Act calls for signs and road markings at junctions (crossroads) where the give-way rule is to apply. The road marking accompanying the sign consists of a large inverted triangle painted just before the place to give way, which is marked by broken white lines across the road.\n\nIn Wales, some signs bear a bilingual legend: the Welsh appears above .\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a stop or give-way sign may be preceded by an inverted, blank, triangular sign with an advisory placard such as .\n\nIn the Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, a yield sign may be warranted\n\nThe sign went through several changes from its original design to the sign used today. Originally invented in 1952 and added to the MUTCD in 1954, the sign used the \"keystone\" shape before adopting the more readily recognized triangular shape. In 1971, the sign evolved into its modern version and changed from yellow to red, paralleling the same change that had earlier been made by Stop signs.\n\n\n"}

The buddha, bodhisattva, or mandala image is located in either a temple or a household butsudan.\n\nThe image can be either a statue or a small scroll and varies from sect to sect. It can be a singular image or a group of images; the \"honzon\" in the main (\"hondou\") or treasure (\"kondou\") hall of the temple can be for that particular hall or the entire temple complex. Sometimes \"honzon\" is the central image (\"chuuson\") of a cluster of three (\"sanzonbutu\") or five (\"goson\") images.\n\nThe physical creation of an icon is followed by a consecration ceremony (known as \"kaigen\", literally 'opening the eyes' or 'dotting the eyes'). It is believed this transforms the \"honzon\" into a 'vessel' of the deity which in its own right has power.\nA honzon that takes the form of a statue is called a \"Butsuzō\" (), most likely crafted out of cypress wood or metal such as copper or bronze. The Butsuzō is more common than other types of images. Tori Busshi was an early and renowned creator of worship statues. The Butsuzōzui, originally published in 1690, is a compendium of reproductions of 800 Butsuzō.\n\nBefore the introduction of Buddhism to Japan in the sixth century there is no evidence of \"honzon\" in Shinto worship. Instead, its use was a cultural influence from Buddhism.\nEach sect of Japanese Buddhism has its own \"honzon\" which sometimes varies from temple to temple or even from hall to hall within a given temple. This is a practice that was criticized by Ekai Kawaguchi, a 20th century Japanese religious reformer.\n\nSome images (hibutsu, literally \"secret buddhas\") are considered too sacred for public presentation.\n\nIn Mikkyō practices such as in Shingon Buddhism, the term refers to the divinity honored in a rite.When Kūkai introduced Shingon Esoteric Buddhism and its Buddhist Pantheon to Japan in the 9th century, the statuary worship practices found in China were incorporated. Over the centuries this developed into the Japanese Buddhist pantheon.\n\nThe role of the tutelary figure is similar to that of the yidam in Tibetan Buddhism. Tutelary deities in Vajrayana Buddhism, including Mikkyō, Tangmi and Tibetan Buddhism, are crucial to many religious practices.\n\nIn the Jōdo Shinshū school of Pure Land Buddhism, under the leadership of Honen and Shinran, the use of \"honzon\" became more prevalent. The honzon took the form of inscriptions of the sect's mantra Namu Amida Buddha, other phrases, images of the Buddha, statuary, and even representations of the founder. Rennyo thought a honzon in the form of a written mantra was more appropriate than that of statue.\n\nIn the Rissho Kosei Kai members receive and practice to a honzon enshrined in their homes they label a \"Daigohonzon.\" The scroll consists of an image of Shakyamuni At the Rissho Kosei-kai headquarters there is a Gohonzon that is a statue of Shakyamuni.\n\nAccording to Suzuki, the proper honzon for the Zen altar is Shakyamuni Buddha. He is often attended by other Bodhisattvas and arhats such as statues of Kwannon (Avalokitesvara), Yakusi (Bhaishajyaguru), Jizō (Kshitigarbha), or Miroku (Maitreya). Sometimes there is a trio of Amida (representing the past), Shakyamuni (the present), and Miroku (the future). There are other choices and combinations often influenced by the guiding philosophy of a temple.\n\n\n"}

Sömmerring discovered the macula in the retina of the human eye. His investigations on the brain and the nervous system, on the sensory organs, on the embryo and its malformations, on the structure of the lungs, etc., made him one of the most important German anatomists.\n\nSömmerring was born in Thorn (Toruń), Royal Prussia (a province of the Crown of Poland) as the ninth child of the physician Johann Thomas Sömmerring. In 1774 he completed his education in Thorn and began to study medicine at the University of Göttingen. He visited Petrus Camper lecturing at the University in Franeker. He became a professor of anatomy at the Collegium Carolinum (housed in the Ottoneum, now a Natural History Museum) in Kassel and, beginning in 1784, at the University of Mainz. There he was for five years the dean of the medical faculty. Due to the fact that Mainz became part of the French Republic under the French Directory, Sömmerring opened up a practice in Frankfurt in 1795. As one of his many important enterprises, Sömmerring introduced against many resistances the vaccination against smallpox and became one of the first members of the \"Senckenbergische Naturforschende Gesellschaft\" and was nominated as counselor. He received offers of employment by the University of Jena and the University of St. Petersburg, but accepted in 1804 an invitation from the Academy of Science of Bavaria, in Munich. In this city, he became counselor to the court and was led into the Bavarian nobility.\n\nWhen Sömmerring was 23 years old he described the organization of the cranial nerves as part of this doctoral work: its study is still valid today. He published many writings in the fields of medicine, anatomy and neuroanatomy, anthropology, paleontology, astronomy and philosophy. Among other things he wrote about fossil crocodiles and in 1812 he described \"Ornithocephalus antiquus\" now known as \"Pterodactylus\". He was also the first to accurately draw a representation of the female skeleton structure.\n\nIn addition, Sömmerring was a very creative inventor, having designed a telescope for astronomical observations and an electrical telegraph in 1809. He worked on the refinement of wines, sunspots and many diverse other things. In 1811 he developed the first telegraphic system in Bavaria, which is housed today in the German Museum of Science in Munich. In 1823, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nSömmering was married to Margarethe Elizabeth Grunelius (deceased 1802), and had a son, Dietmar William, and a daughter, Susanne Katharina. Due to bad weather, Sömmering left Munich in 1820 and returned to Frankfurt, where he died in 1830. He is buried at the city's main cemetery.\n\nA subspecies of the Western jackdaw, \"Corvus monedula soemmerringii\", living in north-eastern Europe and north and central Asia, was named after Sömmering in 1811 by Johann Fischer von Waldheim.\n\n\nThe exchange of letters between Sömmering and Georg Forster was published by Hettner (Braunschweig, 1878)eben.\n\n"}

Creech is the aerial training site for the USAF Thunderbirds and \"is one of two emergency divert airfields\" for the Nevada Test and Training Range.\n\nIn addition to the airfield, the base includes the \"UAV-Logistic and Training Facility\", the Joint Unmanned Aerial Systems Center of Excellence, Silver Flag Alpha Regional Training Center, and other military units/facilities. The base is named in honor of retired US Air Force General Wilbur L. Creech, the former commanding officer of Tactical Air Command (TAC), the predecessor command of the current Air Combat Command (ACC).\n\nAfter World War I, Nevada and other western inland states were surveyed by Capt. Lowell H. Smith and Sgt. William B. Whitefield for landing sites. The United States Army Air Corps subsequently rented a large room in Reno, and used the 1929 civilian airfield near Las Vegas (named \"McCarran Field\" ) for 1930s training flights. A 1939 \"western site board\" reconnaissance was conducted near Tonopah for a practice range and in October 1940, Maj. David Schlatter surveyed the southwest United States for a military airfield (Executive Order 8578 transferred a \"60 × 90-mile area at Tonopah to the War Department on 29 October 1940\".) Congressional appropriations of 19 November 1941 for the Commissioner of Public Roads to build \"21 flight strips\" along highways for \"bombing ranges or for other specialized training\" included inland airstrips. \"Initially a tent city military training camp\", construction of \"Indian Springs Airport\" permanent facilities began in March 1942, \"and by February 1943 the camp was used as a divert field and as a base for air-to-air gunnery training.\"\n\nTen protesters were arrested at Creech Air Force Base on 2 October 2019. The base is home to drone operators who pilot drones for both the U.S. military and the CIA in missions across Afghanistan and the Middle East. A week earlier drones had killed 30 civilian farmers in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Nevada World War II Army Airfield at Indian Springs hosted B-17 Flying Fortress and T-6 Texan aircraft. Five Indian Springs Auxiliary Army Airfields were developed at the bombing range. Area 18 had an auxiliary field at Auxiliary Field #4, and Area 51 had an auxiliary field Auxiliary Field #1. In March 1945 Indian Springs AAF was placed on stand-by with a small housekeeping staff and in January 1947, it was closed along with Las Vegas AAF. The Army reopened Indian Springs in January 1948 and in 1950, the first US Air Force unit was assigned to the installation.\n\nFormer Indian Springs auxiliary fields:\nIndian Springs Air Force Base was designated in August 1951 and in July 1952, jurisdiction transferred from Air Training Command to the Air Force Special Weapons Center (AFSWC) of Air Research and Development Command (ARDC). As an AFSWC facility, \"Indian Springs AFB served as a support base for projects from Operation Ranger in 1951 to Operation Storax in 1962.\" \"The 4935th Air Base Squadron was activated to operate the base in accordance with ARDC General Order No. 39 on 16 July 1952\". The base's mission was to support United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) nuclear testing at the Nevada Proving Grounds, northwest, as well as Nellis AFB's operation of the Nellis Air Force Gunnery and Bombing Range. \"At first fewer than 300 officers and enlisted men were stationed at Indian Springs AFB, but when testing began, the population grew to more than 1,500 personnel. The base also hosted more than 100 of the most modern aircraft in the world at the time.\"\n\n\nThe Air Base Squadron transferred under the 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) in 1956, the base launched the Shot John F-89J that fired the MB-1 Genie which detonated over Area 10, and AFSWC jurisdiction at Indian Springs AFB \"continued until 1961\".\n\nIndian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field was designated on 1 April 1961 when \"the USAF transferred Indian Springs AFB missions to Nellis AFB under the control of\" Tactical Air Command.\n\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the primary base mission was range maintenance and the primary unit was the 57th Combat Support Squadron of civil engineers—the only assigned aircraft unit was a detachment of Bell UH-1N Twin Huey helicopters (designated as \"Det 1\").\n\nThe 1982 Thunderbirds Indian Springs Diamond Crash killed all four Northrop T-38 Talon pilots impacting along the runway (controlled flight into terrain). Around 1988 the bulk of Silver Flag Alpha moved to the Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field from Nellis. Indian Springs AFAF was designated a Formerly Used Defense Site by 30 September 2002. In January 2005, No 1115 Flight was formed at the base to operate the Royal Air Force's first UAVs (became part of No. 39 Squadron RAF in March 2007).\n\nOn 20 June 2005, Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field officially changed its name to Creech Air Force Base in honor of Gen. Wilbur L. \"Bill\" Creech, the commander of Tactical Air Command from 1978 to 1984, and activated in October 2005 the Joint Unmanned Aerial Systems Center of Excellence and the 3d Special Operations Squadron (the latter was the 1st MQ-1 Predator squadron in the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). The 42d Attack Squadron was formed at Creech AFB on 8 November 2006 as the first Reaper squadron. By 2007, Creech personnel of the 432nd Aircraft Maintenance Squadron had been deployed to Ali Air Base, and the base transferred from a Nellis AFB unit to the 432d Wing when activated on 1 May 2007 (renamed 432d Air Expeditionary Wing on 15 May 2008.) On 5 March 2008, the 556th Test and Evaluation Squadron became operational as \"the Air Force's [1st] test squadron for unmanned aerial systems\". In 2008 the USGS added the military installation to the Geographic Names Information System (the airport portion of the base was separately designated in 2011).\n\nA 2009 Nevada Desert Experience protest against drone attacks on Pakistan by the United States of America resulted in the convictions of the \"Creech 14\" (e.g., Father Louie Vitale, Kathy Kelly, and John Dear) arrested on the base for trespassing and sentenced on 27 January 2011 for time served (a 2009 protest was also held.) In 2011, keystroke logging software had infected UAV ground stations (\"believed to have spread through...removable drives\"), and the Twenty-Fourth Air Force was alerted to the problem by an article in \"Wired\" magazine. (The virus \"posed no threat to our operational mission\".) In 2012, the ceremony in which the 99th Security Forces Group \"stands down\" also activated the 799th Air Base Group at Creech.\n\nIn July 2019, the 799th Air Base Group was deactivated and responsibility for base support operations transferred to the newly activated the 432nd Mission Support Group, part of the 432nd Wing. The change allowed the 432nd Wing to become installation command authority at Creech, representing a shift away from the base relying on nearby Nellis AFB for support.\n\nCreech is also home to the \"Silver Flag Alpha Regional Training Center\", operated by the 99th Ground Combat Training Squadron (99 GCTS). At Silver Flag Alpha, Security Forces airmen receive mission-specific training prior to being deployed to combat areas. There are two basic courses taught at Silver Flag Alpha; the 17-day Base Security Operations Course which focuses on base defense from within the base boundary and the Area Security Operations Course for airmen whose deployment tasking includes \"outside the wire\" missions where the airmen leave the base perimeter to conduct various missions. Military Working Dog handlers receive additional training along with attending one of the two Silver Flag Alpha courses. Depending on the course the airmen may receive training on the following:\n\nSilver Flag Alpha's range complex includes 12 small arms ranges, a Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) village, a bare base tent city, convoy combat training route, and a vehicle maneuver area.\n\nFlying and notable non-flying units based at Creech Air Force Base.\n\nUnits marked GSU are Geographically Separate Units, which although based at Creech, are subordinate to a parent unit based at another location.\n\nAir Combat Command (ACC)\n\nAir Force Reserve Command (AFRC)\nAir National Guard (ANG)\n\n\nNo. 1 Group (Air Combat) RAF\nAuthor Stephen King presented the site as the base of military operations for the antagonist, in his novel \"The Stand\". Creech was the site for the control of drone surveillance and Hellfire missile deployment in the 2015 film \"Eye in the Sky\".\n\nIt was also briefly seen in \"London Has Fallen\", being the base of a drone strike in Pakistan during the prologue, supposedly killing the antagonist and his family. It is also hinted to be the base of another drone strike in Yemen, this time successfully killing the antagonist.\n\nIt most recently appeared as a location for launching drone strikes in the third episode of \"Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan\".\n\n\n\n"}

He was nephew and adopted heir of his uncle of the half blood, Thomas West, 9th Baron De La Warr, eldest son of the 8th Baron's second wife, Elizabeth Mortimer.\n\nAccording to Riordan:\n\n[In 1549 the 9th Baron] placed a private bill before parliament to disinherit his nephew William West, first Baron De La Warr (c.1519–1595). The latter was the son of the ninth baron's half-brother Sir George West of Warbleton (d. 1538) and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Robert Morton of Lechlade, Gloucestershire. His uncle was childless, and had at some time adopted William as his heir. However, West tried to gain the de la Warr estate early by poisoning his uncle. The attempt was unsuccessful and he was in the Tower by October 1548. He was disinherited by an act of parliament in 1550, although he had been reinstated as heir by the time of his uncle's death.\n\nDespite the fact that he had been reinstated as heir by his uncle, when the latter died in 1554 William West was unable to inherit the barony of de la Warr as a result of the Act of Parliament of 1550 which had deprived him of all honours. Two years later he was involved in the Dudley, and on 30 June 1556 was arraigned at the Guildhall on charges of treason, to which he responded as 'William, Lord de la Warr', forcing the heralds to prove during the trial that he was not entitled to the barony and therefore not entitled to a trial by his peers in the House of Lords. He was convicted of treason. However the death sentence was not carried out, and in 1557 he was pardoned by Queen Mary. He fought at the siege of St. Quentin in that year, and in 1563, early in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was restored in blood. On 5 February 1570 he was knighted, and on the same day created Baron De La Warr, which was regarded as a new creation of the title.\n\nWest took part as a peer in the trials and convictions of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk and, later, his son, Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel.\n\nHe was junior peer in his lifetime, as latest created. However, his son and descendants have been seated with the precedence of 1299, as though they had inherited his uncle Thomas's title. By the modern rules of the House of Lords, his uncle's title fell into abeyance between the daughters of William West's second uncle, Sir Owen West, or their heirs; however, as Cokayne notes, such rules are at best modern approximations to actual medieval practice. What seems clear is that some, but not all, writers treat the letters patent as clarifying the descent of the ancient title, rather than creating a new one, hence William is sometimes referred to as 10th baron.\n\nHe married Elizabeth Strange and was the father of one son, Thomas West, 2nd Baron De La Warr, and three daughters, Jane, Elizabeth, and Mary. Jane West married firstly Thomas Wenman, secondly James Cressy, and thirdly Thomas Tasburgh (c.1554 – c.1602), of Hawridge, Buckinghamshire. She was the mother of Richard Wenman, 1st Viscount Wenman.\n\nWest was succeeded as Baron De La Warr by his son Thomas West, 2nd Baron De La Warr.\n\nWest married firstly, before 1555, Elizabeth Strange, the daughter of Thomas Strange of Chesterton, Gloucestershire, by whom he had two sons and three daughters:\n\n\n"}

Informally, it says that all sufficiently long words in a regular language may be \"pumped\"—that is, have a middle section of the word repeated an arbitrary number of times—to produce a new word that also lies within the same language.\n\nSpecifically, the pumping lemma says that for any regular language formula_1 there exists a constant formula_2 such that any word formula_3 in formula_1 with length at least formula_2 can be split into three substrings, formula_6, where the middle portion formula_7 must not be empty, such that the words formula_8 constructed by repeating formula_7 zero or more times are still in formula_1. This process of repetition is known as \"pumping\". Moreover, the pumping lemma guarantees that the length of formula_11 will be at most formula_2, imposing a limit on the ways in which formula_3 may be split. Finite languages vacuously satisfy the pumping lemma by having formula_2 equal to the maximum string length in formula_1 plus one.\n\nThe pumping lemma is useful for disproving the regularity of a specific language in question. It was first proven by Michael Rabin and Dana Scott in 1959, and rediscovered shortly after by Yehoshua Bar-Hillel, Micha A. Perles, and Eli Shamir in 1961, as a simplification of their pumping lemma for context-free languages.\n\nLet formula_1 be a regular language. Then there exists an integer formula_17 depending only on formula_1 such that every string formula_3 in formula_1 of length at least formula_2 (formula_2 is called the \"pumping length\") can be written as formula_6 (i.e., formula_3 can be divided into three substrings), satisfying the following conditions:\n\n\nformula_7 is the substring that can be pumped (removed or repeated any number of times, and the resulting string is always in formula_1). (1) means the loop formula_7 to be pumped must be of length at least one; (2) means the loop must occur within the first formula_2 characters. formula_32 must be smaller than formula_2 (conclusion of (1) and (2)), but apart from that, there is no restriction on formula_34 and formula_35.\n\nIn simple words, for any regular language formula_1, any sufficiently long word formula_3 (in formula_1) can be split into 3 parts.\ni.e. formula_6 , such that all the strings formula_40 for formula_41 are also in formula_1.\n\nBelow is a formal expression of the Pumping Lemma.\n\nformula_43\n\nThe pumping lemma is often used to prove that a particular language is non-regular: a proof by contradiction (of the language's regularity) may consist of exhibiting a word (of the required length) in the language that lacks the property outlined in the pumping lemma.\n\nFor example, the language formula_44 over the alphabet formula_45 can be shown to be non-regular as follows:\n\nLet formula_46, and formula_47 be as used in the formal statement for the pumping lemma above. We assume that there exists some constant formula_2. Let formula_3 in formula_1 be given by formula_51, which is a string longer than formula_2. By the pumping lemma, there must be some decomposition formula_6 with formula_54 and formula_55 such that\nformula_56 in formula_1 for every formula_58. Using formula_54, we know formula_7 only consists of instances of formula_61. Moreover, because formula_55, it contains at least one instance of the letter formula_61. We now pump formula_7 up: formula_65 has more instances of the letter formula_61 than the letter formula_67, since we have added some instances of formula_61 without adding instances of formula_67. Therefore, formula_65 is not in formula_1. We have reached a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption that formula_1 is regular (i.e. there exists such a formula_2) must be incorrect. Hence formula_1 is not regular.\n\nThe proof that the language of balanced (i.e., properly nested) parentheses is not regular follows the same idea. Given formula_2, there is a string of balanced parentheses that begins with more than formula_2 left parentheses, so that formula_7 will consist entirely of left parentheses. By repeating formula_7, we can produce a string that does not contain the same number of left and right parentheses, and so they cannot be balanced.\n\nFor every regular language there is a finite state automaton (FSA) that accepts the language. The number of states in such an FSA are counted and that count is used as the pumping length formula_2. For a string of length at least formula_2, let formula_81 be the start state and let formula_82 be the sequence of the next formula_2 states visited as the string is emitted. Because the FSA has only formula_2 states, within this sequence of formula_85 visited states there must be at least one state that is repeated. Write formula_86 for such a state. The transitions that take the machine from the first encounter of state formula_86 to the second encounter of state formula_86 match some string. This string is called formula_7 in the lemma, and since the machine will match a string without the formula_7 portion, or with the string formula_7 repeated any number of times, the conditions of the lemma are satisfied.\n\nFor example, the following image shows an FSA.\n\nThe FSA accepts the string: abcd. Since this string has a length at least as large as the number of states, which is four, the pigeonhole principle indicates that there must be at least one repeated state among the start state and the next four visited states. In this example, only formula_92 is a repeated state. Since the substring bc takes the machine through transitions that start at state formula_92 and end at state formula_92, that portion could be repeated and the FSA would still accept, giving the string . Alternatively, the bc portion could be removed and the FSA would still accept giving the string ad. In terms of the pumping lemma, the string abcd is broken into an formula_34 portion a, a formula_7 portion bc and a formula_35 portion d.\n\nIf a language formula_1 is regular, then there exists a number formula_17 (the pumping length) such that every string formula_100 in formula_1 with |\"w\"| ≥ \"p\" can be written in the form \nwith strings formula_34, formula_7 and formula_35 such that formula_106, formula_107 and\nFrom this, the above standard version follows a special case, with both formula_111 and formula_112 being the empty string.\n\nSince the general version imposes stricter requirements on the language, it can be used to prove the non-regularity of many more languages, such as formula_113.\n\nWhile the pumping lemma states that all regular languages satisfy the conditions described above, the converse of this statement is not true: a language that satisfies these conditions may still be non-regular. In other words, both the original and the general version of the pumping lemma give a \"necessary\" but not \"sufficient\" condition for a language to be regular.\n\nFor example, consider the following language:\nIn other words, formula_1 contains all strings over the alphabet formula_116 with a substring of length 3 including a duplicate character, as well as all strings over this alphabet where precisely 1/7 of the string's characters are 3's. This language is not regular but can still be \"pumped\" with formula_117. Suppose some string \"s\" has length at least 5. Then, since the alphabet has only four characters, at least two of the first five characters in the string must be duplicates. They are separated by at most three characters.\n\nThe Myhill–Nerode theorem provides a test that exactly characterizes regular languages. The typical method for proving that a language is regular is to construct either a finite state machine or a regular expression for the language.\n\n\n"}

Located at the confluence of the Humqui and Matapédia Rivers, it is the seat of La Matapédia Regional County Municipality. The main access road is Quebec Route 132.\n\nThe Mi'kmaq word \"amgoig\", also written \"humqui\", \"unkoui\" and \"ankwi\", means \"the place to have fun\", \"half wall\" or \"place of amusement and pleasure.\" Another Mi'kmaq name for the area is \"Amkooĭk\" or \"Mkooögwĭk\" which aptly describes the area as \"boggy.\" One source postulates that its name comes from the swirling water at the junction of the Humqui and Matapédia rivers. However, the most plausible explanation appears to be more pragmatic: Amqui was formerly a place where Amerindians gathered for pow wows.\n\nOriginally Mi'kmaq territory, the area was granted as a seignory by Louis de Buade de Frontenac to Charles-Nicolas-Joseph D'Amours in 1694. D'Amours died in 1728 and none of his descendants claimed the rights to the seigneury. So it remained a remote and undeveloped land until the 19th century. In 1830 construction began on the Kempt Road, a strategic military road between Quebec and the Maritimes, completed in 1833, that opened the area to colonization. But it was the construction of the Intercolonial Railway in the 1870s that brought real development.\n\nIn 1879, the post office opened under the name Amqui. In 1881, the Mission of Saint-Benoît-Joseph-Labre was established, named after Benedict Joseph Labre. By 1884, the town became known as a great destination for salmon and trout fishing. In 1889, the mission became a parish and the following year it was incorporated as the Parish Municipality of Saint-Benoît-Joseph-Labre.\n\nIn 1907, the village itself separated from the parish municipality and was incorporated as the Village Municipality of Saint-Benoît-Joseph-Labre, renamed to Amqui in 1948. It gained \"town\" status in 1961.\n\nIn January 1991, the Parish Municipality of Saint-Benoît-Joseph-Labre was merged into the Town of Amqui.\n\nAmqui is located to the south of the Saint Lawrence River in the Matapédia Valley, which was formed by the Chic-Choc Mountains. The valley is of glacial origin and was formed during the Paleozoic era millions of years ago. The region is characterized by gentle slopes through which the Matapédia river snakes from the northwest to the southeast. The city is located at the confluence of the Humqui and Matapédia rivers.\n\nThe city is situated 415 km northeast of Quebec City, 345 km west of Gaspé and 80 km north of New Brunswick. Neighboring urban centres include Rimouski and Mont-Joli, at 105 km and 70 km to the west, respectively, and Matane, 65 km to the north. Amqui is located 25 km east of Sayabec and 20 km northwest of Causapscal, the two largest municipalities of La Matapédia after Amqui. The city borders Saint-Vianney and Saint-Tharcisius to the north, Saint-Alexandre-des-Lacs to the east, Lac-au-Saumon and Saint-Léon-le-Grand to the south, as well as Sainte-Irène and Val-Brillant to the west. The Courtuval hamlet is part of Amqui.\n\nAmqui's climate is temperate. Being surrounded by the Chic-Chocs creates unique climatic conditions in the region: a long and snowy winter and a hot and humid summer.\n\nThe central community of Amqui, excluding the smaller communities within its municipal boundaries, is counted as a population centre in Canadian census data, with a population of 4,557 in 2011; three non-contiguous parcels of land which were part of the pre-1991 boundaries of Amqui but are not sufficiently urbanized to be included in the primary population centre are also separately counted as a designated place, with a population of 258 in the same census.\n\nAccording to the Statistics Canada website, 6,090 of Amqui's 6,120 residents speak French as their first language. In addition, 12% can speak both French and English.\n\nMembers of the city council are elected every four years on the first Sunday of November and are conducted electronically. It is composed of seven members:\n\nProvincially, Amqui is represented by Pascal Bérubé in the Matane-Matapédia electoral district.\n\nFederally, the city is represented by Jean-François Fortin in the Haute-Gaspésie—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia electoral district.\n\nThe two-story Amqui railway station built in 1904, is served by Via Rail's \"Ocean\", and Montreal – Gaspé trains. Both trains share the same rail line between Montréal and Matapédia. It is protected by the federal government under the Act on the Protection of heritage railway stations since 1993.\n\nThe station is representative of the boom at the turn of the century, and the associated expansion of the railways in general, the Intercolonial Railway of Canada (IRC) in particular. Amqui depended on the railway to transport their agricultural products and finished parts made of wood. Subsequently, Amqui became an important stop on the train's route from Montréal to Halifax, and from Montréal to Gaspé.\n\nThe design of the station Amqui is unusual for a station of the IRC. It is distinguished by its two-stage design, housing the housing of the station master and his family.\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n"}

Jesus has just begun preaching in Galilee. In this verse he encounters the first of his disciples.\n\nThe original Koine Greek, according to Westcott and Hort, reads:\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 4:18\n\nThis verse is based on , with only a few changes. Matthew adds \"two brothers\", perhaps to make the relationship more explicit, or in Nolland's view to make the calling in this verse more closely parallel the calling of James and John.\n\nThis verse introduces two of Jesus' most important followers the brothers Simon and Andrew, both of these figures play an important role in the Gospels and are given prominent roles by almost all Christian churches. Schweizer notes that, unlike Mark, Matthew immediately mentions that Peter is an alternate name for Simon. Schweizer feels this is because Matthew's audience would have been well aware of the stories of the disciple and knew him by the name Peter. This has the effect of changing the meaning of from Jesus bestowing a nickname upon Simon to merely using a nickname that had long been attached to him. Throughout the book Matthew uses the name Peter, only using the name Simon on rare occasions.\n\nThe name Simon is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Shimeon, a common Jewish name that Albright and Mann note is found in the Old Testament and in Josephus. Both Andrew and Peter are names of Greek origins which France sees as an accurate reflection of the multicultural nature of the Galilee at this time. Albright and Mann note that evidence for Andrew being used as a name for a Jew dates back to 169 BC.\n\nFrance notes that the Sea of Galilee at the time was known for its prosperous fishing industry. This was mainly based around fishing for sardines, carp, and \"musht\" fish. Various methods were used, but nets were common. Dragnets were common, but they required a large team to use. This verse is thus more likely referring to some form of gill net. Fishing was a common occupation of the region and that the disciples seem to own their own equipment is evidence that they were relatively prosperous.\n\n"}
{"id": "2070381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070381", "title": "Focke-Wulf Triebflügel", "text": "Focke-Wulf Triebflügel\n\nThe Focke-Wulf \"Triebflügel, or Triebflügeljäger\", literally meaning \"thrust-wing hunter\", was a German concept for an aircraft designed in 1944, during the final phase of World War II as a defence against the ever-increasing Allied bombing raids on central Germany. \nIt was a vertical take-off and landing tailsitter interceptor design for local defense of important factories or areas which had small or no airfields.\n\nThe \"Triebflügel\" had only reached wind-tunnel testing when the Allied forces reached the production facilities. No complete prototype was ever built.\n\nThe design was particularly unusual. It had no wings, and all lift and thrust were provided by a rotor/propeller assembly 1/3 of the way down the side of the craft (roughly halfway between the cockpit and tailplane). When the plane was sitting on its tail in the vertical position, the rotors would have functioned similarly to a helicopter. When flying horizontally, they would function more like a giant propeller.\n\nThe three rotor blades were mounted on a ring assembly supported by bearings, allowing free rotation around the fuselage. At the end of each was a ramjet. To start the rotors spinning, simple rockets would have been used. As the speed increased, the flow of air would have been sufficient for the ramjets to work and the rockets would expire. The pitch of the blades could be varied with the effect of changing the speed and the lift produced. There was no reaction torque to cause a counter rotation of the fuselage, since the rotor blades were driven at their tips by the ramjets. Fuel was carried in the fuselage tanks, and was piped through the centre support ring and along the rotors to the jets.\n\nA cruciform empennage at the rear of the fuselage comprised four tailplanes, fitted with moving ailerons that would also have functioned as combined rudders and elevators. The tailplane would have provided a means for the pilot to control a tendency of the fuselage to rotate in the same direction as the rotor, caused by the friction of the rotor ring, as well as controlling flight in pitch, roll and yaw.\n\nA single large and sprung wheel in the extreme end of the fuselage provided the main undercarriage. Four small castoring wheels on extensible struts were placed at the end of each tailplane to steady the aircraft on the ground and allow it to be moved. The main and outrigger wheels were covered by streamlined clamshell doors when in flight.\n\nWhen taking off, the rotors would be angled to give lift in a similar manner to a helicopter. Once the aircraft had attained sufficient altitude the pilot would tilt it over into level flight. The rotors continued spinning in level flight, maintaining 220 rpm at the aircraft's maximum forward speed.\n\nForward flight required a slight nose-up pitch to provide some upward lift as well as primarily forward thrust. Consequently, the four cannon in the forward fuselage would have been angled slightly downward in relation to the centreline of the fuselage.\n\nTo land, the craft had to slow its speed and pitch the fuselage until the craft was vertical. Power could then be reduced and it would descend until the landing gear rested on the ground. This would have been a tricky and probably dangerous maneuver, given that the pilot would be seated facing upward and the ground would be behind his head at this stage. Unlike some other tailsitter aircraft, the pilot's seat was fixed in the direction for forward flight. The spinning rotor would also obscure rear vision.\n\nThis design was unique among 20th-century VTOL craft, and other German concept craft. However, some early design studies for the Rotary Rocket Roton spacecraft in the 1990s showed a free-spinning rotor with tip-driven rotors providing lift.\n\nIn the 1950s, the US built prototype tailsitter aircraft (the Lockheed XFV, and Convair XFY Pogo), but these were powered by conventional turboprops, with nose-mounted contra-rotating propellers to counter torque. They also used conventional wings for lift, though their cruciform tails with integral landing gear were broadly comparable to the \"Triebflügel\".\n\n\n"}

There, he started working as a street vendor but eventually became the prosperous owner of several clothing shops. He attributed his newfound prosperity to his conversion to Christianity. He had joined the Beijing branch of the London Missionary Society led by British missionary Samuel Evans Meech (1845-1937). When attending the London Missionary Society, Wei was also influenced by Cheng Jingyi, and espoused some teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.\n\nIn 1915, Wei met Norwegian missionary to China Bernt Berntsen, became a Pentecostal and joined his Apostolic Faith Mission. In May 1917, Wei reportedly heard a voice telling him that “you must receive the baptism of Jesus.” He felt he should go to the Yongdingmen gate in Beijing, where the voice asked him to proceed to a nearby river where, as he reported, Jesus appeared and personally baptized him facedown, giving him an armor and a sword. Satan also appeared, but Wei defeated him with the sword received from Jesus. After this vision, Wei left the Apostolic Faith Church and founded his own church, which he called the True Jesus Church. His followers believed that Wei’s vision had restored the original Christian church. They hailed Wei as “the new Martin Luther,” commissioned by Jesus to reform and restore the genuine Christian Church.\n\nDespite oppositions, including by Berntsen, who sued Wei claiming he had defrauded him of revenues of a business partnership they had established together, the True Jesus Church was able to gather several thousand members. Wei predicted that the world will end in 1921 or 1922.

In the episode, Peter and Lois go on a second honeymoon to spice up their marriage, but are chased by Mel Gibson after Peter steals the sequel to \"The Passion of the Christ\" from Gibson's private hotel room. Meanwhile, Brian and Stewie take care of Chris and Meg at home.\n\n\"Family Guy\" had been canceled in 2002 due to low ratings, but was revived by Fox after reruns on Adult Swim became the cable network's most watched program, and more than three million DVDs of the show were sold. Written by series creator Seth MacFarlane and directed by Peter Shin, much of the plot and many of the technical aspects of the episode, as well as the title, are direct parodies of the 1959 Alfred Hitchcock movie \"North by Northwest\"; in addition, the episode makes use of Bernard Herrmann's theme music from that film.

The episode was watched by nearly 12 million viewers and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour). Shin won an Annie Award for Directing in an Animated Television Production for this episode.\n\nIn the cold open, Peter tells his family that they have \"been canceled\". He then lists all 29 shows, like \"Titus\" and \"Andy Richter Controls the Universe\", that were canceled by Fox between the show's cancellation and revival and says that if all of those shows were to be canceled, they might have a chance at returning.\n\nAs Peter and Lois are having sex, she yells out George Clooney's name, so Peter realizes that she is imagining him as Clooney to maintain her libido. Lois and Peter decide to take a second honeymoon to enliven their marriage, and leave their anthropomorphic dog Brian to take care of their children Stewie, Chris, and Meg. Brian is unable to control the children, but Stewie offers to help (in exchange for Brian changing his diaper) and together they manage the home. The pair chaperone a dance at Chris's school, during which the school principal catches Chris in the boys' restroom with vodka that belongs to his classmate Jake Tucker. Although Brian and Stewie punish Chris by grounding him, they try to clear his name. Jake's father Tom refuses to believe Brian and Stewie, so they resort to planting cocaine in Jake's locker, and Jake is sentenced to community service.\n\nOn the way to their vacation spot, Lois falls asleep. Unfortunately, Peter doesn't pay attention to the road, deciding instead to read a comic book while driving, and crashes the car into a tree. They are forced to spend their entire honeymoon money on car repairs and are about to return home when Peter discovers that actor/director Mel Gibson has a private suite at a luxurious hotel nearby, \"which he barely uses\". He and Lois then go to the hotel, where Peter poses as Gibson to gain access to his room. When Lois yells out Gibson's name during intercourse, Peter, again, decides to return home. As the two are about to leave, Peter accidentally stumbles upon Gibson's private screening room and discovers a sequel to \"The Passion of the Christ\" entitled \"The Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This\". To spare the world from \"... another two hours of Mel Gibson Jesus mumbo-jumbo,\" Peter steals the film. However, when they leave the hotel, they are noticed by two priests, Gibson's associates, who were there to collect the film.\n\nPursued by the priests in a car chase that leads them through a shopping mall, Lois and Peter escape from the priests and drive to a cornfield where Peter buries the film. While he is doing so, the priests fly down in a crop-duster and kidnap Lois. Peter is then given a message telling him that if he does not return the film to Gibson at his estate on top of Mount Rushmore, his wife will be killed. Peter arrives at the house and gives Gibson a film can. As Peter and Lois are about to leave, Gibson discovers that the film has been replaced with dog feces, leading to a chase on the face of the mountain. While being chased, Lois slips but hangs on to George Washington's lips. Peter grabs her and, while being held at gunpoint, he tells Gibson that the film \"is in President Rushmore's mouth\" and points to the other side of the monument. Gibson follows Peter's direction and falls off the edge (Peter claims that Christians don't believe in gravity) as Peter pulls Lois to safety. Upon climbing back to the top of the mountain, the two have sexual intercourse there, improving their marriage.\n\nIn 2002, \"Family Guy\" was canceled after three seasons due to low ratings. The show was first canceled after the 1999–2000 season, but following a last-minute reprieve, it returned for a third season in 2001. Fox tried to sell rights for reruns of the show, but it was hard to find networks that were interested; Cartoon Network eventually bought the rights, \" basically for free\", according to the president of 20th Century Fox Television Production. When the reruns were shown on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim in 2003, \"Family Guy\" became Adult Swim's most-watched show with an average 1.9 million viewers an episode. Following \"Family Guy\"s high ratings on Adult Swim, the first season was released on DVD in April 2003. Sales of the DVD set reached 2.2 million copies, becoming the best-selling television DVD of 2003 and the second highest-selling television DVD ever, behind the first season of Comedy Central's \"Chappelle's Show\". The second season DVD release also sold more than a million copies. The show's popularity in both DVD sales and reruns rekindled Fox's interest in it. They ordered 35 new episodes in 2004, marking the first revival of a television show based on DVD sales. Fox president Gail Berman said that it was one of her most difficult decisions to cancel the show, and was therefore happy it would return. The network also began production of a film based on the series.\n\"North by North Quahog\" was the first episode to be broadcast after the show's cancellation. It was written by MacFarlane and directed by Peter Shin, both of whom also wrote and directed the pilot. MacFarlane believed the show's three-year hiatus was beneficial because animated shows do not normally have hiatuses, and towards the end of their seasons \"... you see a lot more sex jokes and (bodily function) jokes and signs of a fatigued staff that their brains are just fried\". With \"North by North Quahog\", the writing staff tried to keep the show \"... exactly as it was\" before its cancellation, and did not \"... have the desire to make it any slicker\" than it already was. Walter Murphy, who had composed music for the show before its cancellation, returned to compose the music for \"North by North Quahog\". Murphy and the orchestra recorded an arrangement of Bernard Herrmann's score from \"North by Northwest\", a film referenced multiple times in the episode.\n\nFox had ordered five episode scripts at the end of the third season; these episodes had been written but not produced. One of these scripts was adapted into \"North by North Quahog\". The original script featured \"Star Wars\" character Boba Fett, and later actor, writer and producer Aaron Spelling, but the release of the iconic film \"The Passion of the Christ\" inspired the writers to incorporate Mel Gibson into the episode. Multiple endings were written, including one in which Death comes for Gibson. During production, an episode of \"South Park\" was released entitled \"The Passion of the Jew\" that also featured Gibson as a prominent character. This gave the \"Family Guy\" writers pause, fearing accusations \" that we had ripped them off.\"\n\nThree days before the episode debuted on television, it was screened at the University of Vermont (UVM) in Burlington, accompanied by an hour-long question-and-answer session with MacFarlane. The UVM's special screening of the episode was attended by 1,700 people. As promotion for the show, and to, as Newman described, \"expand interest in the show beyond its die hard fans\", Fox organized four \"Family Guy Live!\" performances, which featured cast members reading old episodes aloud; \"North by North Quahog\" was also previewed. In addition, the cast performed musical numbers from the \"Family Guy Live in Vegas\" comedy album. The stage shows were an extension of a performance by the cast during the 2004 Montreal Comedy Festival. The \"Family Guy Live!\" performances, which took place in Los Angeles and New York, sold out and were attended by around 1,200 people each.\n\nThe episode opens with Peter telling the rest of the family that \"Family Guy\" has been canceled. He lists the following 29 shows (in chronological order), that he says Fox has to make room for: \"Dark Angel\" (lasted for 2 seasons and cult following), \"Titus\" (though \"Titus\" was facing cancellation the same year \"Family Guy\" was), \"Undeclared\", \"Action\", \"That '80s Show\", \"Wonderfalls\", \"Fastlane\", \"Andy Richter Controls the Universe\", \"Skin\", \"Girls Club\", \"Cracking Up\", \"The Pitts\" (the show that Seth MacFarlane worked on after Family Guy's cancellation), \"Firefly\", \"Get Real\", \"FreakyLinks\", \"Wanda at Large\", \"Costello\" (premiered before Family Guy hit the airwaves), \"The Lone Gunmen\", \"A Minute with Stan Hooper\", \"Normal, Ohio\", \"Pasadena\", \"Harsh Realm\", \"Keen Eddie\", \"The $treet\", \"The American Embassy\", \"Cedric the Entertainer Presents\", \"The Tick\", \"Luis\", and \"Greg the Bunny\". Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance, the joke being all these shows had indeed already been canceled by Fox. \"The New York Times\" reported that, during the first \"Family Guy Live!\" performance, \"... the longer [the list] went, the louder the laughs from the Town Hall crowd [became]\".\n\nAustralian-American actor Mel Gibson is prominently featured in the episode; his voice was impersonated by André Sogliuzzo. Gibson directed the film \"The Passion of the Christ\" (2004) and, in the episode, is seen making a sequel entitled \"Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This\". The fictional sequel is a combination of \"The Passion of the Christ\" and \"Rush Hour\" (1998), and stars Chris Tucker, who starred in \"Rush Hour\", and Jim Caviezel who portrayed Jesus in \"The Passion of the Christ\".\n\nBesides the title, the episode contains several references to Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 film \"North by Northwest\", including the scene where Lois is kidnapped by Gibson's associates, the two priests flying a crop-duster who chase Peter through a cornfield, and the final face-off between Peter, Lois and Gibson that takes place on Mount Rushmore.\n\nAs Peter and Lois are driving to Cape Cod for their second honeymoon, Peter is reading a Jughead comic book and their car crashes. The fictional Park Barrington Hotel, where Peter and Lois steal Gibson's film, is located in Manhattan. The car chase scene through a shopping mall is a recreation of a scene from the 1980 comedy film \"The Blues Brothers\". To stop Meg and Chris from fighting, Brian reads to them from one of the few books Peter owns, a novelization of the 1980 film \"Caddyshack\" and quotes a line by Chevy Chase's character, Ty Webb.\n\nThe episode contains a number of other cultural references. When Peter and Lois enter their motel room and find a hooker on the bed, Peter warns Lois to stay perfectly still, as the prostitute's vision is based on movement. This is a reference to a scene in the movie \"Jurassic Park\" (1993) in which Dr. Grant gives this warning in reference to a \"Tyrannosaurus Rex\". Pinocchio appears in a cutaway gag, in which Gepetto bends over and deliberately sets Pinocchio up to tell a lie in an attempt to emulate anal sex. This was based on a joke MacFarlane's mother had told her friends when he was a child. Lois yells out George Clooney's name when she and Peter are having sex. The 1950s sitcom \"The Honeymooners\" is also referenced when a fictional episode of the sitcom is shown in which Ralph Kramden, the show's main character, hits his wife, Alice, something he would only threaten to do on the show. Meg watches an episode of the CBS sitcom \"Two and a Half Men\", which shows three men in a living room, one of whom is cut in half at the waist and screaming in agony, the other two standing over him and screaming in horror. Fictional army soldier Flint of appears briefly after Chris is caught drinking vodka, and educates the children on drinking and informs them that \"... knowing is half the battle\". Flint's voice was provided by Bill Ratner, the actor who had voiced the character in the G.I. Joe television series. According to Seth Green, who voices Chris, the reason the \"Family Guy\" cast members did not voice Flint themselves is because if you have the original actor providing the voice \" you take it with a little bit more gravitas\".\n\n\"North by North Quahog\" was broadcast on May 1, 2005 as part of an animated television night on Fox, was preceded by two episodes of \"The Simpsons\" (including the show's 350th episode), and was followed by the premiere of MacFarlane's new show, \"American Dad!\". It was watched by 11.85 million viewers, higher than both \"The Simpsons\" and \"American Dad\". The episode's ratings were \"Family Guy\"s highest ratings since the airing of the season one episode \"\". \"Family Guy\" was the week's highest-rated show among teens and men in the 18 to 34 demographic, and more than doubled Fox's average in its timeslot. The episode's first broadcast in Canada on Global was watched by 1.27 million viewers, making it fourth for the week it was broadcast, behind \"\", \"\" and \"Canadian Idol\".\n\nThe reactions of television critics to \"North by North Quahog\" were mostly positive. In a simultaneous review of the two episodes of \"The Simpsons\" that preceded this episode and the \"American Dad!\" pilot, Chase Squires of the \"St. Petersburg Times\" stated that \"North by North Quahog\" \"... score[d] the highest\". Multimedia news and reviews website IGN was pleased to see Stewie and Brian get more screen time as a duo, something they thought had always been one of the show's biggest strengths. IGN placed Peter's idea to pose as Mel Gibson and steal \"Passion of the Christ 2\" in 9th place on their list of \"Peter Griffin's Top 10 Craziest Ideas\". Matthew Gilbert of \"The Boston Globe\" commented that the episode's material \"would wear thin after a while if the character's weren't as distinct and endearing as they are, most notably Stewie, the wrathful infant.\"\n\nCritics reacted positively to the opening sequence; in his review of the episode, Mark McGuire of \"The Times Union\" wrote: \"... the first minute or so of the resurrected \"Family Guy\" ranks among the funniest 60 seconds I've seen so far this season.\" \"Variety\" critic Brian Lowry considered the opening sequence to be the best part of the episode. M. Keith Booker, author of the book \"Drawn to Television: Primetime Television from The Flintstones to Family Guy\", called the opening sequence an \"... in-your-face, I-told-you-so rejoinder to the Fox brass  followed by one of the most outrageous \"Family Guy\" episodes ever\".\n\nHowever, the episode also garnered negative responses. Melanie McFarland of the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" stated that \"Three years off the air has not made the 'Family Guy' team that much more creative\". Kevin Wong of PopMatters thought the episode made fun of easy targets such as Gibson and \"The Passion of The Christ\", although he felt \"Family Guy\" regained \"... its admirable mix of niche nostalgia and hysterical characterizations\" after the first two episodes of the new season. Though Alex Strachan, critic for \"The Montreal Gazette\", praised the opening sequence, he felt \"it's all downhill from there\". Bill Brioux of the \"Toronto Star\" considered the show to be similar to \"The Simpsons\". Media watchdog group the Parents Television Council, a frequent critic of the show, branded the episode the \"worst show of the week\".\n\n\"North by North Quahog\" was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour), the eventual recipient of the award being \"South Park\" episode \"Best Friends Forever\". Peter Shin, director of the episode, won the Annie Award for Best Directing in an Animated Television Production. Fellow \"Family Guy\" director Dan Povenmire, was nominated for the same award for directing \"PTV\".\n\n"}

TF121 was a multi-service force from Joint Special Operations Command, made up of operators from the U.S. Army's Delta Force, 75th Ranger Regiment, and 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, the U.S. Navy's SEAL Team Six, the CIA's Special Activities Division, U.S. Air Force Combat Controllers, Pararescuemen, Tactical Air Control Party operators, and Special Operations Weather Technicians, the Aviation Tactics Evaluation Group (AvTEG), and the Joint Communications Unit. Two companies of armor from the U.S. Army 4th Infantry Division provided armor support.\n\nTF121 was a combination of the now defunct Task Force 5 and Task Force 20, which operated in Afghanistan and Iraq respectively. Acting on the apparent logistic redundancy of keeping two separate task force teams for Iraq and Afghanistan, General John Abizaid decided to combine both teams into a single streamlined force, forming the TF121. The force was approximately 1,500 soldiers with its own support capabilities.\n\nTask Force 20's primary goal was to capture or kill \"High-value targets\" (HVTs), such as Iraqi Mujahideen leaders and former Ba'ath party regime members and leaders. Task Force 20 operators were directly involved in the 4-hour firefight between 101st Airborne soldiers and Saddam Hussein's sons, Uday and Qusay Hussein. The two sons were killed in the shootout. The apprehending of the most wanted man in Iraq, Saddam Hussein, in Operation Red Dawn directly involved Task Force 121 operators and members of the Army's 4th Infantry Division.\n\nTask Force 20 was also involved in what the US military calls a tragic accident on 27 July 2003. At least three Iraqis were killed in western Baghdad's Mansour district, when US soldiers from Task Force 20 opened fire on cars that overshot a military cordon. The drivers apparently had missed the cordon when they turned into the area from an unblocked side street.\n\nTF121's primary mission was the apprehension of High Value Targets and was organized in such a way that it has a close relationship with intelligence personnel (CIA operators are an integral part of the unit) and has timely and unhindered access to any relevant data gathered by intelligence assets in the area. Such an option is invaluable to any Special Operations team, and especially so to one whose primary mission is hunting elusive fugitives whose hideouts change frequently and randomly.\n\nMany TF121 groups were assigned Special Forces CIRA (Communications Intelligence Reconnaissance and Action) operators with expertise in relevant fields. These operators work closely with the intelligence agencies tied to TF121 and work to pinpoint and identify HVTs aggressively.\n\nOn 21 July 2003, Saddam's sons Uday and Qusay were killed in a firefight with TF20 operators and soldiers from 101st Airborne. On 13 December 2003, Operation Red Dawn netted HVT #1, Saddam Hussein. After intelligence narrowed down the target to two possible locations, TF121 coordinated the raid with 600 soldiers from the 4th Infantry Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team and Apache Troop 1-1 Cavalry Regiment, 4th Brigade, 1st Armored Division.\n\nAccording to an internal army investigation leaked to the \"Washington Post\", Task Force 121 was responsible for the illegal abuse of detainees in secret interrogation facilities in Iraq. In 2006, after the unit had changed its name to Task Force 6-26, a Human Rights Watch report recorded evidence of continued abuse, including beatings and waterboarding.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2070436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070436", "title": "High-heeled shoe", "text": "High-heeled shoe\n\nHigh heels are a type of shoe in which the heel, compared with the toe, is significantly higher off the ground. They make the wearer appear taller, accentuating the calf muscle and the length of the leg overall. There are many types of high heels, which come in different styles, colors and materials, and can be found all over the world. They have significant cultural and fashionable meanings attached to them, which have been largely shaped by historical contexts over the past 1,000 years. Wearing high heels is associated with some health problems.\n\nHigh heels have a long history, dating as far back as the tenth century. The Persian cavalry, for example, wore a kind of boot with heels in order to ensure their feet stayed in the stirrups. Furthermore, research indicates that heels kept arrow-shooting riders, who stood up on galloping horses, safely on the horse. This trend has translated into the popular 21st-century cowboy boot. Owning horses was expensive and time-consuming, so to wear heels implied the wearer had significant wealth. This practical and effective use of the heel has set the standard for most horse-back riding shoes throughout history and even into the present day. Later, in the 12th century in India, heels become visible again. The image of a statue from the Ramappa Temple proves this, showing an Indian woman's foot clad in a raised shoe. Then, during the Medieval period, both men and women wore platform shoes in order to raise themselves out of the trash and excrement filled streets. In 1430, \"chopines\" were high, at times. Venetian law then limited the height to three inches—but this regulation was widely ignored. A 17th-century law in Massachusetts announced that women would be subjected to the same treatment as witches if they lured men into marriage via the use of high-heeled shoes.\n\nModern high heels were brought to Europe by emissaries of Abbas the Great in the early 17th century. Men wore them to imply their upper-class status; only someone who did not have to work could afford, both financially and practically, to wear such extravagant shoes. Royalty such as King Louis XIV wore heels to impart status. As the shoes caught on, and other members of society began donning high heels, elite members ordered their heels to be made even higher to distinguish themselves from lower classes. Authorities even began regulating the length of a high heel's point according to social rank. Klaus Carl includes these lengths in his book \"Shoes\": \"½ inch for commoners, 1 inch for the bourgeois, 1 and ½ inches for knights, 2 inches for nobles, and 2 and ½ inches for princes.\"” As women took to appropriating this style, the heels’ width changed in another fundamental way. Men wore thick heels, while women wore skinny ones. Then, when Enlightenment ideals such as science, nature, and logic took hold of many European societies, men gradually stopped wearing heels. After the French Revolution in the late 1780s, heels, femininity, and superficiality all became intertwined. In this way, heels became much more associated with a woman's supposed sense of impracticality and extravagance.\nThe design of the high French heels from the late 1600s to around the 1720s placed body weight on the ball of the foot, and were decorated with lace or braided fabric (pictured). From the 1730s-1740s, wide heels with an upturned toe and a buckle fastening became popular. The 1750s and 1760s introduced a skinnier, higher heel. The 1790s continued this trend, but added combinations of color. Additionally, throughout all of these decades, there was no difference between the right and left shoe.\n\nIn Britain in 1770, an act was introduced into the parliament which would have applied the same penalties as witchcraft to the use of high heels and other cosmetic devices.\n\nHeels went out of fashion starting around 1810, and then in 1860 they returned at about two and a half inches. The Pinet heel and the Cromwell heel were both introduced during this time. Their production was also increased with the invention and eventual mass production of the sewing machine around the 1850s. With sewing machines, yields increased as machines could quickly and cheaply \"position[n] the heel, stitc[h] the upper, and attac[h] the upper to the sole.\" This is also a prime example of how the popularity of heels interacts with the culture and technology of the time.\n\nWith the 1900s bringing two devastating world wars, many countries set wartime regulations for rationing almost all aspects of life. This included materials previously used for making heels, such as silk, rubber, or leather; these began to be replaced with cork and wooden soles. Another one of the numerous outcomes of these wars was an increase in international relations, and a more proliferate sharing of fashion through photography and films, which helped spread high heel fashion as well. Examples of this were the brown and white pumps with cutouts or ankle straps combined with an open toe. Their practicality yet professional look appealed to the new, fast-paced lifestyle of many women.\n\nAlternatively, World War II led to the popularization of pin-up girl posters, which men would often hang in their bunks while at war. Almost all of these girls were pictured wearing high heels, leading to an increase in the relationship between high heels and female sexuality. The tall, skinny stiletto heel was invented in 1950, strengthening the relationship between women, sexuality, and appearance. There was a weakening of the stiletto style during both the late 1960s / early 1970s and also 1990s when block heels were more prominent, followed by a revival in the 2000s.\n\nThe intricate and complex history of high heels has led to a variety of cultural thoughts and lenses through which people view them today. Firstly, it is very exclusively gendered in the sense that few men wear high heels in present times. Secondly, magazines like \"Playboy\", as well as other media sources portraying women in a sexual way, often do so using high heels. Paul Morris, a psychology researcher at the University of Portsmouth, argues that high heels accentuate \"sex specific aspects of female gait\", artificially increasing a woman's femininity. Respectively, the arching of a woman's back facilitated by wearing high heels signals a woman's willingness to be courted by a man. Keeping this sexual undercurrent in mind, heels are considered fashionable for women in most cases. It could be semi-formal with a \"button down silk blouse…jeans and high heels.\" Or, it could be formal with a dress or pants suit. Finally, 20th and 21st century cultural values have dictated that high heels are the norm in professional settings for a woman. Some researchers argue that high heels have even become part of the female workplace uniform, and operate in a much larger and complex set of display rules. High heels are considered to pose a dilemma to women as they bring them psychosexual benefits but are detrimental to their health. The 21st century has introduced a broad spectrum and variety of styles, ranging from height and width of heel, to design and color of the shoe.\n\n\nHigh heels have been made from all kinds of materials throughout history. In the early years, leather and cowhide was preferred. As civilizations progressed, silk and patent leather were introduced, while cork and wood were utilized as cheap resources in times of war. After the World Wars and the increase in production of steel, the actual heel was a piece of steel wrapped in some kind of material. This has enabled designers to make heels taller and skinnier without them snapping. The soles below the ball of the foot of Ballroom shoes can also be made of materials like smooth leather, suede, or plastic. \n\nWearing high-heeled shoes is strongly associated with injury, including injury requiring hospital care. There is evidence that high-heel-wearers fall more often, especially with heels higher than 2.5 cm, even if they were not wearing high heels at the time of the fall. Wearing high heels is also associated with musculoskeletal pain, specifically pain in the paraspinal muscles (muscles running up the back along the spine) and specifically with heel pain and plantar calluses (only women tested).\n\nA 2001 survey conducted by researchers from Pennsylvania State University using 200 women found that 58% of women complained of lower back pain when wearing heels and 55% of women said they felt the worst overall back pain when wearing the highest heel. The researchers explained that as heel height increases, the body is forced to take on an unnatural posture to maintain its center of gravity. This changed position places more pressure and tension on the lower lumbar spine which explains why the women complained of severe back pain at a higher heel length. \n\nIn a 1992 study, researchers from the University of California, Davis and Thomas Jefferson University wanted to investigate the effects of increased heel height on foot pressure using forty-five female participants walking across a pressure plate in various heel heights. A Biokinetics software was used to analyze the exact pressure locations on and along each participants' foot. The researchers were able to conclude that an increase in heel height lead to an increase in pressure beneath each of the Metatarsal bones of the foot. Additionally, they found that the highest heel heights caused constant pressure that could not be evenly dispersed across the foot.\n\nIn a 2012 study, Kai-Yu Ho, Mark Blanchette and Christopher Powers, wanted to determine if heel height increased patellofemoral joint stress during walking. The patellofemoral joint refers to junction where the femur and patella meet. The study consisted of eleven participants wearing tracking and reflective markers as they walked across a 10-meter force plated walkway in low, medium and high heels. The study showed that as the height of the heel increased, the ball of the foot experienced an increase in pressure resulting in increased discomfort levels and peak patellofemoral joint stress. The researchers also mentioned that the long term usage of high heels would lead to repetitive overstress of the joint which would result in an increase in pain and eventually, patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis and Patellofemoral pain syndrome. \n\nIn a 2012 study, researchers examined the risk long time high heel wearers would have in regards to calf Muscle fascicle length and strain. The control group consisted of women who wore heels for less than ten hours weekly and the experimental group consisted of women who wore heels for a minimum of forty hours weekly for at least two years. The experimental group was told to walk down a walkway barefoot and in heels while the control group walked down barefoot as cameras recorded their movements to calculate muscle fascicle lengths. The data showed that wearing heels shortened the length of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle fascicles in the calf significantly as well as increasing stiffness in the Achilles Tendon. The experimental group also demonstrated a larger amount of strain on the muscle fascicles while walking in heels because of the flexed position the foot is forced into. The researchers were able to estimate that when wearing heels, the estimated fascicle strains were approximately three times higher and the fascicle strain rate was approximately six times higher. Additionally, they were able to conclude that the long term usage of high heels can increase the risk of injuries such as strain along with discomfort and muscle fatigue.\n\nWearing high-heeled shoes is associated with developing bunions, a deformity of the foot.\n\nIn 2016, scientists from the Department of Physical Therapy in the Sahmyook University in Korea conducted a study to examine the effects of increased heel height and gait velocity on balance control. Balance control refers to the ability of the body to maintain itself along the line of the center of gravity within a base of support. This must be achieved with minimal postural sway velocity which is the horizontal movement of a body trying to maintain balance when standing still. Wearing high heels narrows the base of support that the body has in order to avoid falling and also restricts the area within which the body must sway. In this study, the participants were told to wear either a low or high heel and walk at a low and high speed on a treadmill. As a result of this experiment, the researchers were able to conclude that as heel height increased, the sway velocity of the bodies increased which also modified the position of the knee joint. Muscles have to realign the entire body especially the hips along the line of gravity. As the weight of the body shifted forward, the hips were taken out of alignment and the knee joints experienced stress in order to adjust to the shift. \n\nIn a 2016 study from the Sahmyook University in Korea, researchers wanted to investigate the effects of high heels on the activation of muscles in the cervical and lumbar portions of the spine which refers to the neck and lower back. Thirteen women were recruited to walk down a walkway in three different testing conditions: barefoot, in 4 cm heels and in 10 cm heels. Surface electrodes were placed on the muscle mass of the women's spines as well as their feet to measure the electrical activity of muscles at different points of movement. The results of the study indicated an increase in both cervical and lumbar muscle activation as heel height increased. The cervical spine, the neck, assists in maintaining head stability and postural control in the body. The usage of high heels shifts the body's center of mass which forces the spine to adjust itself in order to maintain balance. The researchers mentioned that over time these results would increase local muscle fatigue that could lead to muscle swelling, decreased muscle movement and even tissue deformation.\n\nFurther research reveals that another possible consequence of wearing high heels is an increase of pressure in one's veins. Experiments have proven that the higher the heel, the \"higher [the] venous pressure in the leg.\" This means that after repeated use of high heels, varicose veins and other undesirable symptoms are much more likely to appear in the legs. Other research supports these two claims when arguing that wearing high heels can lead to numerous long term effects, including accidental trauma to multiple areas of the body.\n\nIn Carmel-by-the-sea, California, heels over 2 inches high, with less than one square inch of bearing surface, can be worn only with a permit.\n\nIt has been argued that high heels in the workplace should be subject to a health and safety assessment.\n\nResearch shows that heels draw attention to long legs and small feet. Some argue that \"high-heeled shoes, perhaps more than any other item of clothing, are seen as the ultimate symbol of being a woman.\" High heels often play a key role in emphasizing a wearer's, most commonly a woman's, arched back and extended buttocks. This \"natural courting pose\" sexualizes the wearer, and can turn them into objects subjected to the male gaze. This research highlights the emphasis heels place on the appearance of the wearer, instead of their arguably more valuable internal traits such as intelligence, creativity, or strength.\n\nIt has not been popular for men to wear high heels since the late 18th century. Some men see the cultural norm, which often mandates that women must wear heels to look professional, as completely unproblematic. However, women report that they are often painful to walk in, and commonly result in negative side effects to joints and veins after prolonged use.\n\nAt the feminist Miss America protest in 1968, protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \"Freedom Trash Can.\" These included high-heels, which were among items the protestors called \"instruments of female torture\" and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced femininity.\n\nIn 2015, a group of women were turned away from a film première at the Cannes Film Festival in France for wearing flat shoes, including a woman physically unable to wear heels due to an operation on one of her feet. The women complained that this was a sexist policy which forced women into a stereotyped appearance; festival organisers later responded that there was no official policy on footwear and stated that they would remind red carpet officials of this.\n\nSome dress codes require women to wear high heels, and some medical organizations have called for a ban on such dress codes. There have been repeated protests by women workers against such policies. Laws regarding dress codes that require women to wear high heels in the workplace vary. \n\nIn the UK in 2016 temporary receptionist Nicola Thorp was sent home unpaid after she refused to follow the dress code of firm Portico. Thorp launched an online petition calling for the UK government to \"make it illegal for a company to require women to wear high heels at work\". Two parliamentary committees in January 2017 decided that Portico had broken the law; by this time the company had already changed its terms of employment. The petition was rejected by the government in April 2017 as they stated that existing legislation was \"adequate\". Existing legislation allows women to be required to wear high heels, but only if it is considered a job requirement and men in the same job are required to dress to an \"equivalent level of smartness\".\n\nIn April 2017 the Canadian province of British Columbia amended workplace legislation to prevent employers from requiring women to wear high heels at work. Other Canadian provinces followed suit.\n\nThe Philippines forbade companies from mandating that female employees wear high heels at work in September 2017.\n\nThe #KuToo campaign in Japan collected over 150,000 signatures on a petition for a ban on mandatory high heels. The government said that they had no plans to change. Japan's labor minister commented that high heels are \"necessary and appropriate\" for women.\n\nA Mile in Her Shoes is a march in which men wear red high heels and walk a mile in protest of domestic violence. Some academics have suggested that by wearing high heels for such a brief period of time, and making a point of acting like they do not know how to walk properly in them, these men are reinforcing the stereotype that only women can or should wear high heels.\n\nHigh heels are marketed to children, and some schools encourage children to wear them. 18% of injuries from wearing high heels were in children, and 4% in under-tens, in a 2002-2012 US survey. Concern was expressed about children's use of high heels in a 2016 medical review on high-heeled shoes. A nine-year old is about half an adult's height, and a toddler about a quarter; so, relative to body height, a 2-inch (5 cm) heel on an adult would be a one-inch heel on the nine-year-old, and a half-inch heel on the toddler, though whether this translates to comparable health harms is not known.\n\nMany styles of dance involve the usage of heels. Ballroom dancing shoes are designed for usage based on the style of dance being performed. International Standard Ballroom shoes for women are closed toed shoes with a 2 to 2.5 inch sturdy heel because steps are performed using the heel of the foot. International Latin and American Rhythm shoes are open toed, strapped heels that are an average of 2.5 to 3 inches in height. These shoes have the least-sturdy heel because International Latin and American Rhythm styles are performed on the ball of the foot. Additionally, this style of shoe is designed with a flexible sole to allow for pointed feet. Lastly, American Smooth shoes are closed toed, flexible soled shoes that range in heel height from 2 to 2.5 inches. An additional non-traditional ballroom dance that uses heels is the Argentine Tango. While dancing the Argentine Tango, women often wear pointed heels ranging in 2 to 4 inches in height. The higher the heel height, the more advanced in technique and ability a dancer is. The heels are used to change the overall stance of the woman by tilting the hips forward, making the stomach flatter and pushing the backside out. Additionally, the heels cause unsteadiness which forces women to dance on their toes and lean on their partner which adds to the fluidity of the movements. A relatively modern style of dance called Heels Choreography or Stiletto dance specializes in choreography that blends the styles of jazz, hip-hop and burlesque with the fusion of vogue movements and is performed using stilettos or high heels. Some dancers such as Yanis Marshall specialize in dancing with high-heels.\n\nAn analysis of the dance-related injuries in 113,084 adolescents in US emergency rooms from 1991–2007 was conducted using data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. The most common injury found among the data were sprains and strains which accounted for 52.4% of the data. Additional injuries include back and leg pain, loss of joint mobility in the wearer's knees and blisters. In particular, shoes with a narrow space for the toes can squeeze tightly enough to cause foot deformity. Dancers can add cushioning to the soles of their dancing shoes or inserts to ease the pain during dancing.\n"}

Tidenham is bounded by the River Wye (which forms the Welsh border) to the west and the River Severn to the south. Offa's Dyke runs through the western part of the parish, terminating at Sedbury cliff above the River Severn.\n\nThe parish includes the villages of Tidenham, Beachley, Boughspring, Sedbury, Tutshill and Woodcroft, and according to the United Kingdom Census 2001 had a population of 5,316, increasing to 5,486 at the 2011 census. At one time it included the now-abandoned village of Lancaut. Tidenham, Beachley and Woolaston were added to Gloucestershire by the first Act of Union of England and Wales in 1536; previously they had been part of the Marcher lordship of Striguil.\n\nThe stretch of the Wye Valley lying within the parish includes several popular rock climbing cliffs at Wintour's Leap near Woodcroft and the Devil's Pulpit, a famous rock formation and viewpoint overlooking Tintern Abbey. The parish also contains Tidenham Chase - the largest remaining fragment of lowland heathland in Gloucestershire. Also notable is the former Dayhouse Quarry which, after providing traffic for the remaining fragment of the former railway to Monmouth, is now home to the National Diving and Activity Centre. The railway has been the centre of several attempts to re-open it, but the overgrown track tells the result of these efforts to restore Tidenham station quite effectively. It ran through Tintern up the Wye Valley, and joined the mainline near Tidenham.\n\nLocated as it is between the Wye and Severn the area has always been important as a site for crossing these rivers. Historically ferries crossed the River Severn from Beachley to Aust and now this route is followed by the Severn Bridge one of whose piers stands on the Beachley peninsula although the bridge itself begins in Wales. From Roman times the River Wye has been bridged between Tutshill and Chepstow.\n\nThe village, once known as Dyddanhamme, is one of the most heavily documented Saxon villages in Britain and has been home to a grand manor of some kind since at least the 6th century AD. The Saxon structure was owned by the Abbott of Bath, who retained some of the documents on what was then an important location until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The current Tidenham Manor is of Georgian design, overlooking the river and conveniently located adjacent to the Norman parish church.\n\nAn electoral ward in the same name exists. The population and area of the ward is identical to the parish quoted above.\n\nThe area is served by Chepstow railway station on the Gloucester to Newport Line.\n\nThe area was previously served by Tidenham railway station on the Wye Valley Railway. The scenic line which ran from Chepstow via Tintern to Monmouth Troy was closed in 1959.\n\n\n"}

He was the winner of the 1916 Indianapolis 500.\n\nDario Resta was born in Faenza, Italy but was raised in England from the age of two. He began racing there in 1907 when he took part in the Montagu Cup, the very first race staged at the new Brooklands race track. He set a record of in a half-mile run a few years later. On October 2, 1913, alternating with Jean Chassagne and Kenelm Lee Guinness in two-hour spells, Resta set up a series of long distance World Records with a Sunbeam Grand Prix car fitted with a single-seater body. After competing in Grand Prix motor racing in Europe, including the 1913 French Grand Prix, he went to the U.S.\n\nIn early 1915 he was brought to the United States by Alphonse Kaufman, an America importer of Peugeots, to drive Kaufman's Peugeot EX3. In February he won the United States Grand Prix, more properly named the United Staes Grand Prize, at San Francisco followed by a victory in the Vanderbilt Cup. After leading during the final stages of that year's Indianapolis 500, he finished second to Ralph DePalma when his car skidded and he had to make a pit-stop for tyres. Resta then drove his blue Peugeot to victory in the inaugural race on the board track at the Chicago Speedway on 26 June 1915. The race received eighteen pages of coverage in the 1 July 1915, issue of \"Motor Age\" magazine.\n\nThe following year, in 1916, en route to winning the United States National Driving Championship, Resta repeated as the winner of the Vanderbilt Cup plus he won the 1916 Indianapolis 500, the Chicago 300, the Minneapolis 150 and the Omaha 150 races.\n\nWith World War I raging in Europe and the United States entering the war in 1918, races were reduced to a minimum. During 1918 Resta drove a Peugeot at a race in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, a minor event with only a handful of competitors.\n\nIn 1923 Resta returned to racing at the age of 39, making his first appearance in Beverly Hills, California. Next, he made another attempt at Indianapolis but was forced out of the race after . Racing again in Europe, Resta finished 3rd in the Penya Rhin Grand Prix and won the voiturette class at the Spanish Grand Prix. He drove for Sunbeam in the 1924 season with teammates Henry Segrave and Kenelm Lee Guinness.\n\nDario Resta was killed in England on 3 September 1924 at the age of 40 when his car crashed at Brooklands while trying for a new land speed record. Resta was driving a Sunbeam when a belt on his car broke on the second lap and punctured his tire sending him out of control. The car crashed through a corrugated iron fence on the Railway Straight and caught fire.\n\nThis accident also hospitalized his riding-mechanic, Bill Perkins, causing him to miss the San Sebastian Grand Prix a few weeks later. Perkins was Sunbeam driver Kenelm Lee Guinness's regular mechanic and so was substituted by Tom Barrett. Guinness suffered a serious crash during this race, in which Barrett was killed and this accident led to the end of the practice of carrying riding-mechanics during races.\n\n"}

The bones, jars, shells, and other artifacts and fossils were found in the Bolobok Rock Shelter Cave Archaeological Site, which has been declared as an Important Cultural Treasure by the government in 2017.\n\nMuch of the Bongao area was the center of Bajau culture and arts for hundreds of years. By the 14th century, Muslim missionaries from Arabia arrived and established the first ever mosque in the Philippines. The area was heavily converted to Islam, especially when the Sultanate of Sulu in nearby Sulu province was founded.\n\nThe province of Tawi-tawi was never officially controlled directly by the Spanish as the Sultanate of Sulu was in a perpetual war with Spain, resulting to the preservation of its Muslim and Bajau cultures. However, the sultanate waned and was captured by Spain, only to be handed to American forces after a few years. Sibutu remained under Spanish rule until 1900.\n\nBefore the armed rebellion of the MNLF in the early 1970s, Bongao was merely a backwater village ruled by the prominent noble Halun family, who used to own about three-quarters of the island. The capital of the province was \"Batu-Batu\" (in Panglima Sugala) in the mainland situated in a cove with deep waters suited for anchors of the Philippine Navy. At the height of the armed rebellion and fearing that the provincial capitol might be overrun, the government transferred it to Bongao. The white-washed, Taj Mahal-inspired provincial capitol building is located on a hill overlooking the bay and the whole town to the North of the Island against the backdrop of Mount Kabugan and the famous Bud Bongao (Bongao Peak).\n\nThe transfer of the seat of government ushered the rapid development of the island as the southernmost center of commerce and trade. Suddenly, the population swelled as individuals (and their families) who are in government service moved to the town.\n\nToday, Bongao is a minuscule cosmopolitan site that is becoming a model of multicultural society. In downtown Bongao, there are mosques for the majority Muslim population, a Catholic church, a church for Protestant inhabitants, and a Chinese temple.\n\nThe municipality is the home of the Balobok Rock Shelter-Cave Archaeological Site, which carbon dates the existence of humans on Tawi-Tawi for 5,000-8,000 years, making it one of the earliest human settlement site in Southeast Asia. The entire archaeological site has been declared as an Important Cultural Property by the National Government in 2017.\n\nThe main thoroughfare is Datu Halun Street, where the Town Hall is situated. Poblacion is the commercial hub. Most of the businesses here are owned by local people.

It is often weighted at either the bottom, middle, or top, commonly by a disc or spherical object called a whorl, but many spindles exist that are not weighted by a whorl, but by thickening their shape towards the bottom, such as Orenburg and French spindles. The spindle may also have a hook, groove, or notch at the top to guide the yarn. Spindles come in many different sizes and weights depending on the thickness of the yarn one desires to spin.\n\nThe origin of the first wooden spindle is lost to history because the materials did not survive. Whorl-weighted spindles date back at least to Neolithic times; spindle whorls have been found in archaeological digs around the world.\n\nA spindle is also part of traditional spinning wheels where it is horizontal, such as the Indian charkha and the great or walking wheel. In industrial yarn production, spindles are used as well; see spinning jenny, spinning mule and ring spinning.\n\nThe wood traditionally favoured for making spindles was that of \"Euonymus europaeus\", from which derives the traditional English name spindle bush.\n\nModern hand spindles fall into three basic categories: suspended spindles, supported spindles and grasped spindles. Supported and suspended spindles are normally held vertically, grasped spindles may be held vertically, horizontally or at an angle depending on the tradition.\n\nSuspended spindles are so named because they are suspended to swing from the yarn after rotation has been started. Drop Spindles are a popular type of suspended spindle and get their name because the spindle is allowed to drop down while the thread is formed, allowing for a greater length of yarn to be spun before winding on. Suspended spindles also permit the spinner to move around while spinning, going about their day. However, there are practical limits to their size/weight.\n\nMost supported spindles continue to rest with the tip on one's thigh, on the ground, on a table, or in a small bowl while rotating. Supported spindles come in a great variety of sizes, such as the very large, ~30\" Navajo spindle, the small, extremely fast, metal \"takli\" for spinning cotton, and the tiniest Orenburg spindles (~20 cm, 15gm) for spinning gossamer lace yarns.\n\nGrasped spindles are also known as hand spindles, in the hand spindles, in hand spindles and twiddled spindles; there appears no consensus on nomenclature for this category of spindles though there have been various attempts at creating an agreed nomenclature including dividing this category of spindles into two, such as Crowfoot's attempts to define the difference between grasped and in hand spindles or merging this category into others, such as Franquemont's approach of classing them as supported spindles.\n\nGrasped spindles remain held in the hand using finger or wrist movements to turn the spindle. French spindles are \"twiddled\" between the fingers of one hand while some types of Romanian spindles are grasped in the fist and turned through rotation of the wrist.\n\nWhile spindle types are divided into these three main categories, some traditional spinning styles employ multiple or blended techniques. For example the Akha spindle, a short spindle with a large centre-whorl disc, is supported by the hand of the spinner during drafting of cotton fibre, but during the adding of extra twist to stabilize the yarn, the spindle is dropped to rest on the yarn.\n\nA familiar sight from history books is a spindle used in conjunction with a distaff, an upright stick with a large quantity of loose fibre wound around it, to be easily accessed. There are many other methods for controlling the pre-spun fibre, such as coiling it around one's lower arm, or through a bracelet, or wrapping it loosely around a yarn braid hanging from one's wrist.\n\nAnother way spindles are categorised is by the location of the whorl. The whorl, where present, may be located near the top, bottom or centre of the spindle. For example a top-whorl drop spindle will have the whorl located near the top of the shaft underneath a hook that allows the spindle to suspend as it is being spun. The newly spun yarn is wound below the whorl and forms a ‘cop’. Depending on the location of the whorl and style of the spindle, the cop can be conical, football or ball shaped and it can be wound above, below or over the whorl.\n\nSpindles can also be used for plying: intertwining two or more single strands of yarn together in order to create a stronger, more balanced, more durable yarn.\n\nWhile hand spindles vary, there are some similarities in the parts that make up a spindle.\n\nSpindle shafts can be made out of a variety of materials such as wood, metal, bone or plastic. They may have very little shaping or be dramatically shaped enough to form part of the whorl. Shafts may be left plain or decorated with painting or carving.\n\nThe shaft is how the spinner inserts twist through turning it between the fingers or rolling it between the hand and another part of their anatomy, such as their thigh. The thickness of the shaft affects how fast the spindles spins with narrower shafts contributing to a faster spinning spindle.\n\nMany spindles will have a point at the top of the shaft to fix the thread to. Options include a simple length of shaft to tie the thread around, a shaped notch or bulb, or a hook.\n\nA whorl is a weight that is added to many types of spindles and can be made out of a large variety of materials including wood, metal, glass, plastic, stone, clay or bone. Whorls may be decorated or left plain, and they may be affixed permanently to the shaft or they may be removable.\n\nWhorl shapes vary greatly and can include ball-shaped, disk-shaped and cross shaped whorls. The shape and mass distribution of the whorl affects the momentum it gives to the spindle while it is spinning. For example a centre weighted whorl will spin very fast and short, while a rim-weighted disk-shaped whorl will spin longer and slower.\n\nWhorls can be located near the top, middle or bottom of the spindle shaft. Whorl location can affect the stability of the spindle, with bottom whorl spindles being considered more stable.\n\nThe cop is not initially an intrinsic part of the spindle; however, as it is formed it plays a part in the spindle anatomy. Once a length of yarn or thread is spun it is wound around the spindle shaft or whorl to form a cop or a ball. As more yarn or thread is spun this makes the spindle heavier and more center-weighted, which has an effect on the momentum of the spindle. The overall shape of the cop and the skill in winding it also has an impact on how the spindle spins and how much thread or yarn can be stored on a spindle before it is \"full\".\n\nCops can be wound in a ball, cone or football shape.\n\nThe spindle is closely associated with many goddesses, including the Germanic Holda, Norse Frigg and Freya, Egyptian Isis, Greek Artemis and Athena. It is often connected with fate, as the Greek Fates and the Norse Norns work with yarns that represent lives. Because the spinning wheel was not in common use before the 16th century in Europe, the older stories are certainly referring to hand spinning done on a spindle. Chief among these is the French fairy tale \"The Sleeping Beauty\", where the princess is erroneously shown to prick her hand on some part of a spinning wheel in modern illustrations, rather than a spindle.\n\nSupported spindles spin on surfaces such as bowls that are usually ceramic or wooden. This type of spindle gives the user more control of the weight of the yarn. The various types of supported spindles range due to the difference in styles of spinning and yarn weight. Navajo spindles have longer shafts that should reach from the ground to the top of the thigh. The spun yarn is wound above the whorl. In Icelandic Viking times, the people used a high whorl lap spindle to spin wool into yarn. The high whorl lap spindle has a whorl on top with a hook on the top and a long shaft like other supported spindles. Unlike the Navajo spindle, however, the spun yarn is wrapped around the lower end of the spindle. The roving is prepped first by drafting it before the wool is spun into yarn. The separation between the drafting and spinning creates a softer yarn. Since it is a supported spindle, the yarn is less strained, which also makes the yarn soft.\n\nA typical bottom whorl spindle has the spun single ply yarn above the whorl instead of below it like top whorl drop spindles. Bottom whorl spindles are the preferred spindle for plying yarn. Turkish drop spindles have a low whorl spindle that have two arms that intersect to make a cross. Like other drop spindles it is spun and then it hangs while the wool is being drafted and the twist travels up the wool. When winding the spun yarn on to the arms it usually is put over and under the arms on the spindle. Even though it turns much more slowly than winding onto a regular spindle it creates a center pull ball of yarn.\n\nTop whorl spindles commonly have a disc on the top of the shaft with a hook at the top.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is the southernmost place in the Philippines.\n\nIt is called the \"Venice of the Philippines\" due to the use of boats as primary transportation, although footbridges connect one house to another. The major sources of livelihood are fishing and farming, although there is very sparse agricultural land available.\n\nSitangkai is politically subdivided into 9 barangays. \n\nThe historical Sitangkai group of islands is comprised the islands, areas, and barangays of present Sitangkai and Sibutu municipalities. The islands had been at the crossroads of the sea trade route and were a traditional enclave of the Bajau and Sama people who for centuries had peacefully lived off fishing and trading. The \"Kadatuan and Kasalipan (Salip/ arabic; Sharif)\" of Sitangkai and Sibutu were descended from the royalties of Sulu, Sabah, and Sarawak. Historical personalities such as the Datu Iskandar of Sibutu and the Datu Halon of Sitangkai was descended from the Datu Baginda Putih, Datu Baginda Hitam, and the feared Datu Kurunding of Lahat Datu from Borneo (now part of the Malaysian and Indonesian states). In the early 1900s, a man named Lailuddin ibn Jalaluddin from the area of \"Nunukan\", \"Parang, Sulu\" was noted to be the first \"Tausūg\" to settle in Sitangkai, bringing with him his clan, wealth, and slaves. Together with his sons and nephews, they settled, intermarried, and made alliances with the local traditional leaders and inhabitants. During World War II, Sitangkai and Sibutu, being closer to British Borneo, was targeted by patrols and occasional raids by Japanese Imperial soldiers. Sitangkai nowadays is still a jump off port for traditional traders from Sulu, Zamboanga, mainland Tawi-Tawi going to Sabah and Borneo. \n\nPresent day Sitangkai was created as a municipality on August 26, 1959, by virtue of Executive Order No. 355 of President Carlos P. Garcia. On October 21, 2006, with the ratification of Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 197, 16 of its 25 barangays were transferred to the newly created municipality of Sibutu, all of which are located on Sibutu Island. Most of the residents of present day Sitangkai are settlers from Sulu, Zamboanga, and the Visayas, brought over the years and registered by subsequent competing politicians to add votes for elections. This unjust settling policy has continued unabated over the past decades, destroying the natural demographics of Sitangkai and adjoining islands, thereby affecting the natural resources of the area and disenfranchising the original peaceful Bajau and Sama inhabitants who moved to Zamboanga or Sabah, Malaysia or fled to far away \"pondohans\" (shallow sandbars). Lack of opportunities, facilities, the proliferation of illegal arms, drug addiction, and piracy are problems facing Sitangkai today.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nTandubas is politically subdivided into 20 barangays. \n12 barangays are located on the island of Tandubas (Tongbangkaw, Tapian, Ballak, Kakoong, Tangngah, Silantup, Butun, Kepeng, Sallangan, Tapian Sokah, Sibakloon and Sapa); 2 barangays are located on Tingungun Island (Kalang-kalang and Salamat); 1 barangay is located at Naungan Island (barangay Naungan); 2 barangays are located on Tandubato island (Lahay-Lahay and Tandubato); 2 barangays are located on Tawitawi Island (Himba and Baliongan), and 1 barangay located on Taruk Island (Barangay Taruk).\n\nThe Municipality of Tandubas is located in the north-eastern part of the province of Tawi-Tawi. It is bounded in the north by Languyan Municipality and Sulu Sea; south by Celebes Sea; east by Municipality of South Ubian: and west by Municipality of Sapa-Sapa.\n\nThe municipality is approximately away from the Municipality of Bongao, the capital town of Tawi-Tawi. From Bongao it is accessible by water transportation. Travel time from the port of Bongao to the Municipality of Tandubas takes about five (5) hours using a motor launch with an average speed. For a speedboat or a fast craft it will only take about an hour.\n\nThe word Tandubas coined from two Malay words \"Tanjung Bas\". \"Tanjung\" means “place”, while the word \"Bas\" means “Landing”. Therefore, Tandubas means a place of landing, referring to a group of Malaysian traders who sailed across many islands and landed on an island what is now Tandubas Island. Seeing the abundance of resources to sustain their living, this group of Malaysian traders finally decided to settle on that island and named it as Tanjung Bas.\n\nFor many years, the island had been named as Tanjung Bas. The Malaysian word Tanjung has its equivalent in Sama dialect which is Tandu. The name Tanjungbas has been changed by the natives to Tandubas, a name that was used from generation to generation.\n\nTandubas had been a part of the Sultanate of Sulu prior to the creation of Sulu as a province under the Republic of the Philippines. When the province of Sulu was created, Tandubas was one of the Districts, an administrative sub-division of the then Department of Education under the Division of Sulu. By virtue of Executive Order No. 355, dated July 1, 1958, Tandubas was converted to a Municipality under the Province of Sulu, covering areas now under the municipality of Sapa-Sapa, the municipality of Languyan, an area in the mainland of Tawi-Tawi. When the Province of Tawi-Tawi was created by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 302, dated September 27, 1973, the Municipality of Tandubas became one of the municipalities in the Province of Tawi-Tawi.\n\nBy 2008, the municipality celebrated its Golden Anniversary. In a bid to create more local government units that comprise the Province of Tawi-Tawi, the Municipality of Sapa-Sapa was created entirely from Tandubas Municipality. Also the Municipality of Languyan was created partly out of the territorial jurisdiction of the Municipality of Tandubas, thus greatly reducing the land area of the mother municipality. This was made possible by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1086.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is also known as Philippine Turtle Islands to distinguish it from its Malaysian counterpart; while locals call it Taganak.\n\nAccess to the Turtle Islands is difficult, as there are no regular means of transportation to the area. This has kept the islands protected from turtle egg poachers. A station for park rangers is also present on the islands.\n\nTurtle Islands are politically subdivided into 2 barangays. \n\nTaganak, Boaan, Great Bakkungaan, Lihiman and Langaan are inhabited. Baguan, an island protected for turtle nesting and the smallest island, Sibaung, are uninhabited. According to the 2010 census, the population of the five permanently inhabited islands is people. With a land area of only , the islands have a population density of . On the five inhabited islands the land cover in large areas is dominated by houses. Typical of other rural areas in the Philippines, human settlements are mixed with agriculture. The relative dominance of the settlements is mainly due to the limited land area and the resulting high population density level, which is more than four times the national average.\n\nThe islands are located within the Sulu Sea at the south-western tip of the country, at the edge of the international treaty limits separating the Philippines and Malaysia. The seven islands from largest to smallest are:\n\n\nFresh water is reported available from shallow groundwater on all the islands except the smallest, Sibaung. Perhaps owing to its tiny size and the fact it does not have a fresh water source, Sibaung is sometimes omitted from the list of Philippine Turtle Islands. For example, Presidential Proclamation 171 establishing the Turtle Islands Wildlife Sanctuary refers to 6 islands rather than 7 islands despite covering all of the municipality.\n\nIn the Philippines, mud volcanoes are known to exist only on the Turtle Islands. Presence of these formations are evident on three of the islands - Lihiman, Great Bakkungaan and Boaan Islands. The hills on these islands are mostly mud volcanoes. On Great Bakkungan Island, grey mud quietly flows from the vent in a pulsating manner accompanied by gas bubbling. On Boan Island, mud extrusion had ceased by August 2000.\n\nCompared to the other two islands, in Lihiman Island, a more violent extrusions of mud, mixed with large pieces of rocks occur that it has created a 20-m (66-ft) wide crater on the hilly part of the island. Such extrusions are reported to be accompanied by mild earthquakes and evidence of extruded materials can be found high up the surrounding trees because of its explosive character. Huge amount of materials are discharged from this volcano that drainage was cut on the northern slope of the hill to direct the flow to the sea. Submarine mud extrusions off the island have also been observed by local residents.\n\nTogether with three islands of neighbour country Malaysia and the surrounding coral waters, Turtle Islands are one of the world's few remaining major nesting grounds for the Green Sea Turtles. In 1996, the islands were declared as Turtle Islands Heritage Protected area by the governments of the Philippines and Malaysia as the only way to guarantee the continued existence of the green sea turtles and their nesting sites.\n\nFor the five islands, the Philippine government decided to create special protection zones, and within this zones, only scientific and conservation activities are allowed. In other zones, certain rules are adapted to prevent too much impact by people on the environment and the turtles. Visiting these zones is only possible with strict guidance and under supervision of the staff of the officials of the government.\n\nFor a successful conservation and protection program, the support of the locals was very important. Fishing, for most of them, is the most important activity and source of income. Hunting sea turtles and collecting the turtle eggs for food, had always been a possible source for additional income. From the end of August to December, turtles come by the hundreds from the surrounding coastal waters, to lay and dig their eggs into the sand. The staff of the conservation project were able to succeed in convincing the locals the need to minimise their collecting activities. Local men, women and children, are now involved, helping with the protection activities.\n\nNatural land cover types in the islands are classified as wooded, mangrove, brush, grass and bare. Most of the areas on the five inhabited islands used for agriculture are planted with coconut. There is a seaweed and seagrass industry on the islands. Almost all species have some known economic value. Only those food species, when developed, are likely to be of immediate economic benefit to the local populations.\n\nUnder the Treaty of Paris of 1898 Spain ceded to the United States \"the archipelago known as the Philippine Islands\". The terms of that treaty were supplemented by the Treaty of Washington of 1900. On the basis of this cession, the United States claimed sovereignty over the Philippine Turtle Islands and the Mangsee Islands, all of which were administered by the British North Borneo Company. Responding to the claim, the United Kingdom government said there was \"no intention...to question the title of the United States\" to the islands. However, the UK asked \"whether the United States Government would be willing to forgo their right to these islands, out of consideration for the fact that the North Borneo Company had during many years carried on the administration of [the islands] under the apparent belief the islands formed part of the company's territory, and as the company attached importance to being permitted to retain control over them\".\nUnder a treaty concluded by exchange of notes dated 3 and 10 July 1907, the two countries agreed that the administration of the islands would continue to be carried on by the British North Borneo Company, with that arrangement to end should an international boundary treaty end it or should either government give the other government one year's notice.\n\nBy a further international treaty concluded in 1930 between the United States (in respect of its then overseas territory, the Philippine Archipelago) and the United Kingdom (in respect of its then protectorate, the State of North Borneo) the two powers agreed the international boundaries between those respective territories. In that treaty the United Kingdom unambiguously accepted that Sibuang, Boaan, Lihiman, Langaan, Great Bakkungaan, Tanganak and Banguan together called in that treaty the Turtle Islands as well as the Mangsee Islands were part of the Philippines Archipelago and therefore under U.S. sovereignty. However, by a supplemental international treaty concluded at the same time, the two powers agreed that those islands, although part of the Philippines Archipelago, would remain under the administration of the State of North Borneo's British North Borneo Company. The supplemental treaty provided that the British North Borneo Company would continue to administer those islands unless and until the United States government gave notice to the United Kingdom calling for administration of the islands to be transferred to the U.S. The U.S. never gave such a notice. On 4 July 1946 the Republic of the Philippines was born. It became the successor to the U.S. under the treaties of 1930. On 15 July 1946 the United Kingdom annexed the State North Borneo and, in the view of the United Kingdom, became the sovereign power with respect to what had been the State of North Borneo.\n\nOn 19 September 1946 the Republic of the Philippines notified the United Kingdom that it wished to take over the administration of the Turtle Islands and the Mangesse Islands. The British government responded by asking the Philippine government to reconsider \"because these islands are so far from the nearest Philippine administrative base that...it would be in the best interests of both the Philippines and North Borneo for the latter to remain responsible for the administration of the islands.\" The British agreed to the Philippine request to establish a joint committee to examine the administration of the islands. The joint committee made an inspection of the islands but ultimately on 24 September 1947 the Philippines made known its decision to press ahead with taking over the administration of the islands. Pursuant to a supplemental international agreement, the transfer of administration became effective on 16 October 1947.\n\nThe largest of the islands, Taganak, is near the entrance to Sandakan Bay. The lighthouse on the island, which was of practical importance to nearby North Borneo, became the subject of an international dispute known as the \"Taganak Lighthouse Dispute\". The 1930 international treaty dealing with the transfer of administration of the Turtle Islands including Taganak contained the following provision:\n\nAt the time of the transfer of the island the Philippine government rejected the UK request that the Philippines pay for the cost of the lighthouse and that they provide for its maintenance in the future. The Manila government asserted that the obligations contained in the 1930 treaty \"presupposes naturally that the lighthouse be in working condition at the time of the transfer and that its operation is necessary and will provide some public benefit to the United States, or its successor, the Philippines\". Manila asserted that the lighthouse had been severely damaged in the war, that it had not been in operation since its destruction, and that the Philippines did not need its service. The government was willing to lease the site for the lighthouse to North Borneo for one peso per annum, as long as the British needed and used the facility. The United Kingdom view was that the Philippines was required under the terms of the 1930 treaty concerning the Turtle Islands to maintain the lighthouse in the future. \nOn 26 May 1948 the British Minister, Linton Foulds, in Manila wrote to the Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Joaquín Miguel Elizalde, calling again on the Philippine government to fulfil its obligations under the 1930 treaty as regards paying compensation for the lighthouse and providing for its operation as it remained in a state of ruin. On 23 July 1949 the Philippines responded in the same terms as it had at the time of the transfer. The parties remained in dispute. Prof. Vicente Abad Santos of the University of the Philippines and Lt. Col. Charles D.T. Lennhoff of the U.S. army who reported on the \"Taganak Lighthouse Dispute\" in the American Journal of International Law assessed the arguments of the British and Philippine sides. They concluded that \"the Philippine Government is justified in refusing to pay...and in refusing to provide for [the lighthouse's] maintenance\".\n\nToday, the abandoned lighthouse tower remains at the summit of the island.\n\nThe Turtle Islands were constituted as a 'special municipal district' under the jurisdiction of the Province of Sulu under Executive Order 95 signed by President Manuel Roxas on 13 October 1947. The same executive order proclaimed \"the assumption of jurisdiction and administration by the Republic of the Philippines over the Turtle and Mangsee Islands which form part of Philippine territory\". Under the executive order, a district officer was put in charge of administering the new special municipality.\n\nThe following year, Executive Order 130 was signed by President Elpidio Quirino providing for regular and more usual local government structures. The Turtle Islands were constituted as the \"municipal district of Turtle Islands\" to be governed by article VI, chapter 64, of the Revised Administrative Code. It was provided that the provincial board of Sulu shall act as council for the municipal district of Turtle Islands. The \"district officer of Turtle Islands\" was given the new title of \"municipal district mayor of the Turtle Islands\" and the same powers and duties which pertain to such official in other municipal districts organized under the provisions of article VI, chapter 64, of the Revised Administrative Code, in addition to those prescribed under Executive Order No. 95 in 1947.\n\nIn 1988, the Manila press announced that Malaysia had annexed the islands. Three days of hype, supported by news maps showing the annexation, died away when it was revealed that the \"annexation\" was the result of the misreading of an American naval chart by a Philippine naval officer. The officer mistook a deepwater ship route for the boundary of Malaysia's new economic zone.\n\n"}

Aquino came into presidency, the number of barangays was reduced to 38.\n\nIts geographical local plays a major role in the development of agro-industrial potential in the province and region. Balindong contributes raw materials including forest products. While cottage industry had been home-based for most part, it has high development potentials given sufficient inputs including market access.\n\nThe 1995 survey of Family Income And Expenditures (FIES) indicate that an average Balinndong household earns an annual income of P33,660.00 or P2,805.00 a month. In the same period, Poverty Threshold Income (PTI) in the Province of Lanao del Sur was estimated at P9,364 or a poverty incidence of about 52%. PTI implies that households earning below the rate are considered poor or in the poverty group.\n\nOf the 2000 population of 24,470, 51% of this (12,524) are in the labor force, meaning those aged 14 to 64 years old which are classified as economically active sector. However, viewed from the provincial labor force participation rate of 50%, it can be deduced that Balindong's situation is not far from that reality.\n\nThe Municipality of Balindong is a 5th class in terms of income. Its revenue is derived mainly from its share of Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) from the national government. Currently, the municipality receives an annual IRA of Php28,892,000. Of this revenue, some php5,784,000.00 or 20% of the revenue is earmarked for development activities.\n\nWhile total agricultural area in the municipality stands at 7,024 hectares, representing 24% of the total land area, only about 832 hectares or 12% is effectively utilized for rice (203 has.) and corn (632 has.) farming. Rice farms are mainly rain fed (153 has.) as there is absence of a developed irrigation system in the municipality.\n\nDue to the existence of a wide tract of land for grazing and pasture, Balindong is one of the Province source for cattle and carabao and other livestock products. Inventory of livestock indicate that there exist (2002): cattle – 145 heads, carabao – 131 heads, goat – 135, chicken 417, ducks – 210. The data indicate a decreasing inventory of animals, therefore, a need to replenish the stock.\n\nA survey of annual fish catch from the lake and inland fish-ponds in the municipality from 1997 to 2002 indicate reduction of catch from 17% metric ton to only 8.02 metric tons. Fish species in the lake include Tilapia, Mudfish, Sirung, Carp, Gaby, and Catfish.\n\nBalindong, other than having its own rural health unit, is a site of the District Hospital. Currently, Balindong's Rural Health unit is manned by a physician, 1 public health nurse, 3 midwives, and twelve Barangay Health Workers.\n\nHealth records indicate that leading causes of morbidity, especially among children, include acute respiratory tract infection, influenza, acute gastroenteritis, hypertension, measles with bronchopneumonia, severe dehydration, cancer, and diabetes mellitus.\nOn the other hand, the leading causes of mortality for both adults and children include cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary tuberculosis, vehicular accidents, measles with bronchopneumonia, severe dehydration, cancer and diabetes mellitus.\n\nData culled out from the 2000 Census indicate that the history of Balindong's housing trend is one of decreasing from 1960 at 2,236 units to as low as 1,332 dwelling units in 1980. In 1990, Balindong's dwelling units numbered 1,807 and in 2000 the dwelling units increased to 2,145.\n\nNinety-seven percent of the dwelling units in Balindong are of single house type. The average number of households occupying a single dwelling unit stands at 1.5 with an household population of 11.41 persons per dwelling unit.\n\nCensus data of 2000 reports that the literacy rate of Balindong stands at 86.02% while the Province’ literacy rate was at 80.12%. There are seven (7) elementary schools and two (2) secondary schools in Balindong which caters to the education needs of its population.\n\nElementary\n\nSecondary\n\n"}

The American troops, three infantry battalions and a battery of artillery total to some 1200 men, were led to Bayang by colonel Frank Baldwin to demand the extradition of the Moros responsible for the ambushing and killing of two American soldiers at the construction of a road from Iligan to Lake Lanao, two months earlier.\n\nWhen the sultan of Bayang refused, Baldwin's troops attacked and captured the nearby \"cotta\" (fortress; \"small, castle-like structures with thick, high walls\") of Binidayan on 2 May. They subsequently attempted to capture the \"cotta\" of Pandapatan, which resisted the artillery fire and was only subdued the next day after hand-to-hand combat between Moros and Americans. The number of Moro casualties is estimated at 300 to 400, including the sultan of Bayang and his brother. On the American side, ten soldiers were killed and some forty wounded.\n\nThe \"cotta\" of Pandapatan has been preserved as a historical monument; the fallen of the Battle of Bayang are considered martyrs by Filipino Muslims.\n\nElementary Schools \n\n"}
{"id": "2070495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070495", "title": "Vorstand", "text": "Vorstand\n\nIn German corporate governance, a Vorstand is the executive board of a corporation (public limited company). It is hierarchically subordinate to the supervisory board (\"Aufsichtsrat\"), as German company law imposes a two-tier board of directors.\n\nGerman law confers executive powers on the executive board as a body. It is expected to act collectively and collegially. Unlike the executive committee (\"aka\" operating committee or executive council) of a US or UK company, the executive board is not an adjunct of the CEO (managing director). In contrast to Japanese corporate governance, the German executive board has real decision-making power. It is, by law, the managing body of a company and cannot be instructed by any legal person, be they natural or artificial, to act in such a way as to harm the business. Executive board members are personally liable for accepting any such instructions.\n\nThe specific scope of an executive board's duties varies from business to business. (A group of companies may each have their own individual executive boards, for example). The president of the executive board (i.e., the CEO) and the position's role are determined by the supervisory board. German law permits, but does not require, executive board members to elect a president/CEO from among their number. There are no specific legal requirements regarding the CEO's role, or even for the title given to the holder of the CEO position, although in practice the most common title is simply \"Vorstandsvorsitzender\", literally, \"\"Vorstand\" chairman\". A noticeable minority refer to their CEOs as \"Sprecher\" (lit., \"speaker\"), implying that the CEO is no more than \"primus inter pares\"; probably the best-known example for a company which uses this terminology is Deutsche Bank.\n\nThe exact relationship between the CEO and the other executive officers depends on the company's type, how it was founded, and indeed the individual personalities of the people involved. A family business could, for example, have a strong CEO who is a member of the founding family and exercises a great deal of power over the rest of the board. In other companies, executive officers may hold themselves accountable to the executive board as a whole and not at all accountable to the CEO as an individual.\n\nThe relationships among executive officers can vary too. It is common practice for board members to be senior executives with specific areas of functional responsibility. However, the law requires that they oversee the activities of their fellow officers, since they are still personally liable for any failings outside their specific departments/subdivisions. Each board member has one vote. Decisions are \"never\" escalated, when there is a lack of consensus, to the supervisory board. Executive board meetings are commonly held on a weekly basis and can last up to a whole day.\n\nFormally, the power to appoint executive officers to the board lies with the supervisory board, which can appoint officers with a two-thirds majority vote of approval, or a simple majority if multiple rounds of voting are required in order to reach a decision. Since up to 50% of the supervisory board members are delegates of the employees (or even external trade union representatives, for details see Mitbestimmung), this prevents employees from blocking the appointment of executive officers to the executive board.\n\nExecutive officers have a certain degree of job security, which is partly a preventative measure aimed at ensuring that executive boards are not dominated and that they are not \"packed\" with hand-picked appointees. Officers are usually appointed for the maximum statutory term—5 years. Removal must be for good cause, such as serious breach of duty, and is subject to the supervisory board's veto. When an executive officer's ability to perform their duties is diminished due to old age, it is customary for them to serve out the remainder of their term but with a deputy to help perform their duties. Neither the shareholders nor the executive board can compel an officer to retire, whereas the supervisory board can.\n\nCommonly, the CEO receives between 30% and 50% greater salary than that of the other executive officers. An officer's remuneration usually comprises 65% basic salary, and 35% that is equally split between annual bonuses and benefits.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality, formerly Bumbaran, was changed to \"Amai Manabilang\" under \"Muslim Mindanao Act No. 316\" on January 22, 2015.\n\nBumbaran is named after the well-known Magalinday Bembaran in the Darangen, a famous Meranau (Maranao) Epic that was justifiably placed in the company of known epics of the world. The scenic beauty of the town resembles the beauty of Magalinday Bembaran.\n\nAfter the political efforts of Mayor James Manabilang, Bumbaran was renamed into \"Amai Manabilang\", in honor of his own personal ancestor.\n\nThe municipal boundaries are defined as follows: on the east by the municipality of Wao, separated by a straight line long, drawn northward from Point 1 to Point 2 on the bank of the Maladugao river 1.5 km. East Sumogot on the Lanao–Bukidnon boundary as point 3; then by straight line following the Lumba - a Bayabao–Wao boundary line. Southward of the intersection of the Lana–Cotabato boundary as point 4; then finally 1.72 km. Eastward following the Lanao–Cotabato boundary to the starting point.\n\nAmai Manabilang is politically subdivided into 17 barangays.\nThe town’s climate is similar to that of Baguio City.\n\nBumbaran was commonly known before as “Aparport” its seat of government. Its existence came into being when President Ferdinand E. Marcos signed into law on November 17, 1977, Presidential Decree No. 1243 creating Aparport a separate and independent municipality and naming it the Municipality of Bumbaran, separate from the Municipality of Wao, its mother municipality. This was necessary in order to maximize the enforcement of law and order and expedite optimum and sustainable development.\n\nAt that time, the municipality consisted of 21 barangays namely: Sumogot, Francfort, Lambanogan, Punud, Comara, Aparport, Paglamatan, Natangcopan, Mansilano, Salam, Bandara-Ingud, Ranao-Ibaning, Bagumbayan, Pagonayan, Piagma, Lico, Siuan, Lama, Borntacan, Miorod, and Someorang. It was reduced to seventeen barangays when President Corazon C. Aquino signed an Executive Order in December 1986 abolishing thousands of barangays in the country which affected barangays Lama, Miorod, Borontacan, and Someorang.\n\nThe Municipality of Amai Manabilang is composed of two major groups – 99% Muslim Bangsamoro and 1% Catholic. Catholics inhabited barangays Sumogot and Francfort. The Muslim Bangsamoros occupied the rest of the 17 barangays. Due to the aftereffect of the Settler Program, in spite of Meranau protestations dividing their once united province, on the excuse of geographical and cultural reasons, the Sangguniang Bayan, thru Resolution designated Barangay Francfort as Poblacion (Center) for Catholic populace and Barangay Natangcopan as poblacion for the Muslim Bangsamoros. Barangay Natangcopan is an extension of Barangay Aparport, the original seat of government.\n\nBarangay Francfort, together with barangays Sumogot, Aparport and Mansilano were regular barangays of Wao before Bumbaran was created a municipality.\n\nFrancfort is named after Mr. Franco and Mr. Fortich, the organizers of the National Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Administrator (NARRA) Settlements Project in the Municipality of Wao. It was created as a regular barangay of Wao in 1965. The first settlers of these barangays were the Ilocanos and Ivatans, followed from 1967 by the Ilongos, Visaya, Kapampangan and other smaller Catholic converted ethnic groups. As anticipated through the Settlements pushing the indigenous away from their land and opportunities, peace and order in the area was interrupted by the Catholic militia ILAGA and the response of the Moro Blackshirts from 1972 to 1976 which caused the evacuation of some residents and damage to properties including the burning of houses.\n\nBy November 17, 1977, the Municipality of Bumbaran was created into a separate municipality by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1234 signed by then President Ferdinand Edralin Marcos, and barangay Francfort was included as one of its regular barangays. Consequently, in the mid1980s, the people returned little by little.\n\nBefore Bumbaran was created as a separate municipality, Hadji Acob was the Barangay Chairman of Barangay Francfort; on his death, Efren Vaso succeeded him. In the following barangay election, Columbus Kalaw was elected Barangay Chairman until he was defeated by Wilfredo Barcelona. In 1993, Oscar Baldonasa was elected Chairman and he was re-elected in the 1996 and 2002 barangay elections.\n\nBarangay Francfort is bounded on the East by Maridugao/Maridgaw River; West by Barangay Sumogot; On the south Sumogot river; and on the North by Barangay Lambanogan.\n\nMountain ranges, hills, plateaus, and flatland characterize the topography of the barangay. It has a vast agricultural land suited for crops like rice, corn, carrots, sugar cane. Its hydrological features comprise rivers like the Maridugao and Sumogot, streams, swamps, creeks and springs.\n\nBarangay Francfort has a total land area of 1,304 hectares. The soil is loam and the climate is temperate. The population is 1,491 according to the 2000 Census, with 298 households.\n\nThe Municipality of Amai Manabilang is inhabited by settlers of different origins, like Ilonggos, Ivatans, Ilocano, Bisaya and other smaller ethnic groups that dominated barangays Francfort and Sumugot. This is due to the Settlement Program and Land Tenure Laws of the Republic of the Philippines. The Moro Maranaws who came from the different municipalities of Lanao del Sur and Lanao del Norte inhabited the rest of the seventeen barangays of this municipality. Their source of livelihood is farming, mainly crop production. Having rich soil, the municipality is one of the largest corn producers in the province, only second to its mother municipality of Wao for having vast agricultural land capable of producing variable crops which could give sufficient food and income to the population.\n\n"}
{"id": "2070501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070501", "title": "Butig", "text": "Butig\n\n', officially the ', is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt became a municipality under Executive Order No. 21 issued on June 25, 1963 during the term of President Diosdado Macapagal.\n\nButig is politically subdivided into 16 barangays.\n\nButig had forty four (44) barangays during the time of Mayor Sultan Macabayao M. Macadato until 1979, but reduced to only sixteen (16) barangays when Sangcad S. Bao took over as OIC-Mayor during the time of President Corazon C. Aquino.\n\nDama is one of the old towns of Butig. It is considered as the oldest settlement in the center of Mindanao. A sultanate located in the Pangampong (Principality) of Unayan, Lanao, Mindanao, Butig belongs to the confederation of the Sultans of Lanao (Ranao in Maranao language). This historic town is the \"cradle\" of Maranao civilization.\n\nWhile Islamic political institutions were being implemented in Sulu, Muslim traders and possibly itinerant teachers visited the eastern and northern parts of Mindanao Island. The advent of Muhammad Kabungsuwan and his lieutenants developed a system of multiple marriage alliances with various ruling families which served as a means of extending both political control and Islamization. The coming of this intrepid Arab-Malay, to whom the pervasive spread of Islam in Mindanao is attributed, and from whom all the leading sultans of that island have claimed descent, can be calculated to have taken place around the second decade of the sixteenth century. (Majul, 1973)\n\nFrom the above-mentioned marriage alliances came the Moro dynasties of Maguindanao, Buayan, and Butig. From the Maranaos of Butig, Islam was then introduced to the Maranaos of Lake Lanao. Whereas the base and strength of the Buayan sultanate was in the upper valley of the Pulangi in the interior of eastern Mindanao, that of the sultanate of Maguindanao was at the lower valley and the nearby coastal areas. Actually, for many years it was Iranun support that strengthened the Maguindanaon rulers against their antagonists. (Majul, 1973)\n\nIn the time, the continued existence of Islam in Sulu and Mindanao was guaranteed by a more intensive Islamization of their neighbors such as Brunei and Ternate. The royal families of Brunei and Sulu became intimately related, as did those of Maguindanao and Ternate. Commercial relations and religious dialogue expanded among the peoples of these regions ... thus generating a sense of community transcending regional frontiers or dynastic loyalties. (Majul, 1973)\n\nIn 1658, a strong force took the field against the Moros of Mindanao under the command of Don Francisco Estovar, Governor of Zamboanga. The expedition disembarked before the Moro town of Mamucan in the Cotabato Valley. Here an action conducted by Don Pedro de Biruga, who, with a force of 180 Spaniards, destroyed the town of Butig, with many vessels and a quantity of rice.(Hurley, 1936)\n\nBetween 1663, when Zamboanga was abandoned, and 1718 when it was refortified, there was an interlude in the Moro Wars, which allowed the sultanates to become better organized and their Islamic institutions to be reinforced. Vigorous commercial relations with other principalities were initiated. It was around this time, too that the Sulu Sultanate acquired the North Borneo territory from the Sultan of Brunei as a grateful recompense for armed intervention in a dynastic quarrel. Sulu had reached the highest level of its territorial expansion. Actually, Sulu was simply filling up the power vacuum left in the island of Borneo as a result of Brunei's gradual political and commercial decline.\n\nThe Spanish government, principally on account of Jesuit agitation, decided to refortify Zamboanga. The Jesuits, more than any religious order in the Philippines, were the most insistent on the evangelization of Muslims. This attitude cost them (the Jesuits) a few casualties on account of extreme zeal.\n\nIt is proposed that the fifth stage in the history of the Moro Wars began with the refortification of Zamboanga in 1718 and ended in the Spanish failure in the eighteenth century to reduce the Muslim states to vassalage. To achieve this political end, and Spanish plan was devised to convert the sultans of Sulu and Maguindanao preparatory to the eventual conversion of the datus and other subjects. In this stage, the combined Sulu-Maranao attack to capture Zamboanga in 1719 failed. Again, a desultory war followed. The plan to convert the sultans failed in the case of Maguindanao. Although 'Azim-ud-Din, the sultan deposed by his brother, was baptized in Manila in 1751, that action did not have the desired political results in Sulu since the sultanate was in the hands of a usurper. Also, the question of the sincerity of the conversion still remains an open one.\n\nIn this fifth stage, the men of Sultan Mardan and the Maranaos of Butig began their devastating attacks on other parts of the Philippines, reducing the number of tributes for Spain coming from the Visayas and causing a virtual disruption in the economic life of many islands under the Spanish colonial regime. On account of thousands of captives taken by the Muslims, some depopulation started to take place in the Visayas. But all this was in response to the Spanish order in 1751 to enslave captured Muslims and destroy their settlements, boats, plantations, and fields. Yet, as the facts demonstrate, it was the Sulu Sultan who was always the first to initiate moves for a peaceful settlement. The lessening of Spanish power as a direct result of the British invasion of the Philippines and capture of Manila in 1762 once again brought about a decline of hostilities between Spaniards and Sulu and Maguindanao. The Muslim principalities again tried to recapture their days of commercial prosperity, but they were not to be left in peace. (Majul, 1973)\n\nOn December 8, 1720, Dalasi, the Datu of Butig (also known as Rajah \"Janatun\" of Butig), with an armada of one hundred vessels or “paraws” manned by Sultan sa Kanluran, \"Miyangaludan\" and several thousand Moros, attacked Fort Pilar in Zamboanga. He captured a local Jesuit priest and forced the Spanish government in Manila to give ransom payment in exchange for his freedom. (Hurley, 1936) But the accuracy of this report by Hurley is in doubt considering the distance of Butig (Lanao del Sur) to the shores of Zamboanga. Furthermore, the Jesuits in Zamboanga were more engaged with the Tausugs of Sulu; and for Datu Dalasi, a Maranao of Lanao, to get involved in the affairs of the Sulu Sultanate is highly unusual.\n\nIn July, 1908, Lieutenant Burr of the American colonial forces was leading forty men through the Agus River in Mindanao. Near Nyaan the party came to a cotta, well fortified and surrounded with a moat filled with brush. Resistance being encountered, the soldiers cut through the brush with their bayonets and assaulted the fort.\n\nThe first soldier to reach the cotta walls was attacked from the rear by a Moro with a kris. Hearing the cry of the soldier, Lieutenant Burr hurried to his assistance, killing the Moro with a pistol. Another Moro sprang from the shelter of the bush and struck Burr before he could turn to defend himself, dealing the American officer a terrible blow on the head with a campilane.\n\nBurr died a few days later in the hospital at Camp Kiethley.\n\nDuring the years 1908 and 1909, and for a number of years afterwards, the Butig Mountain range and the Lake Lanao and Buldun sections of Mindanao were infested with outlaw bands ranging in size from a few men to several hundred.\n\nEarly in the year 1906, Moro outlaws in the inaccessible mountains of Butig fortified themselves in hill-top strongholds under the leadership of Sultan Mangatung and his brother inlaw, Amai \"Maricor\" of Maciu. Under Mangatung, a great force of outlaws became established at rancherias and were responsible for terrible depredations throughout the district.\n\nGovernment launches operating at the mouth of the Malaig river were frequently fired upon, with the result that a camp of men from the 15th Infantry was established at the river.\n\nThe Moros were invited in for parleys and many of them came in and abandoned the outlaw life to return peacefully to their homes.\n\nA number of the Moros, however, chose to ignore the American request for conciliation, and after a perty commanded by Lieutenant Furlong was fired upon, an American offensive was undertaken. Sultan Mangatung was killed.\n\nColonel J. F. Hutton took the field at the head of three columns of troops in the Butig Mountains. The soldiers were fired upon from the cottas but after eight serious engagements all of the outlaws in the district were annihilated.\n\nUpon completion of these operations in Mindanao, a short period of peace ensued, to be broken by rumblings in Jolo.\n\n\nAtty. Dimnatang Labay Pansar is the incumbent mayor of Butig. His predecessors were mayors Ibrahim M. Macadato, Dimnatang Pansar, Pauli Bao-Macabuntal Ditual, Sunnyboy Mona, Monabantog Kiram, Arapa Datukanug, Palawan Amatonding, Abdulrahman Romato, Datu Mombao Romato, Sangcad Bao,Sultan Macalinog Bao and Sultan Macabayao Macadato (first elected mayor of Butig). Mayor Macabayao M. Macadato has been elected four (4) times (four-year term) as mayor and was only deposed when then dictator President Ferdinand E. Marcos replaced him with OIC in 1979 due to his being in opposition to the ruling KBL Party at that time. The late Macabayao Macadato, former Sultan of the Royale House of Butig is considered as the father of democracy in Butig as many people thereat love him so much due to his being approachable and a hardworking public servant. Butig is one of the oldest town in the province and the inhabitants thereat are connected to all the Seventeen Royal Houses of Lanao. By tradition, any individual who has no blood line in Butig cannot hold any recognized Royal Title in the Sultanate of Lanao.\n\nClashes between the Philippine military and a local terrorist organization known as the Maute group which is believed to have ties with Jemaah Islamiyah started on February 20, 2016, after the Maute Group raided the detachment of the 51st Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army in the town. Islamic State of Iraq and Syria paraphernalia were discovered at the group's lair after government forces overran the group's camp on February 26, 2016. The firefight displaced 2,000 residents of Butig, and killed 42 members of the group and three government troops. In November 2016, the Maute group seized the town but were driven from their positions by Philippine Army troops after about a week of fighting.\n\n\n"}

The standard width of cloth yardage (45 inches) is generally wide enough, so a tupenu can be made in a matter of minutes by cutting and wrapping cloth from the bolt. Women wear a knee length dress, or \"kofu\", over the tupenu. On dress occasions, women wear matching kofu and tupenu, sewn from the same yardage. Fancy tupenus are often slightly tailored, with darts sewn into the top, so that they will fit the body more closely. On ceremonial occasions, women wear a ta'ovala, or finely woven pandanus mat, over the kofu and tupenu. The kiekie, a kind of grass or string skirt, is an acceptable, comfortable alternative to the ta'ovala on most occasions. \n\nThe tupenu worn by men is wide enough to cover the body between the waist and knees, and long enough to wrap securely around the waist. For work and casual wear, any piece of cloth will do. On dress occasions, men will wear tupenu tailored like Western wrap skirts and made from suit material. These tupenu coordinate with Western suit-jackets. Usually the formal tupenu will be covered with a ta'ovala worn as a sign of respect. The man's ta'ovala is analogous to the Western necktie.\n"}

{"id": "2070516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070516", "title": "Malabang", "text": "Malabang\n\n', officially the ', is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people. The town is one of the two former capitals of the Sultanate of Maguindanao 1515, and later became the capital of one of the states of the Confederation of Sultanates in Lanao in 1640.\n\nMalabang is one of thirty-nine municipalities comprising the province of Lanao del Sur in northern Mindanao. It lies on the south-west part of the province and belongs to the second district. It has 37 barangays with a total land area of 37,789.28 km. The distance from Marawi City to Malabang is 71 kilometers. Malabang is bounded on the north by the municipality of Calanogas; on the north-west by the municipality of Picong (Sultan Gumander); on the east by the municipality of Marogong; and on the south by the municipality of Balabagan. To the west of Malabang is Illana Bay.\n\nIt is under the administrative supervision of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) since November 1989, pursuant to R.A. No. 6734 dated June 8, 1989, known as the \"Organic Act of ARM\nM\".\n\nThe municipality is a level plain in its central to southern portion. A slope in the north is bounded by the Municipality of Calanogas. There is also a slope in eastern Malabang.\n\nMalabang is politically subdivided into 37 barangays.\nMalabang comes from the Maranao word \"\"mala\"\", which means big, and \"\"bang\"\" or \"\"adhan\"\" in Arabic, which is a call to prayer. An Arab missionary named Sharif Kabunsuan arrived at the Sultanate of Tubok around the 14th century CE to Islamize the people in mainland Mindanao. Upon docking in the shore of Tubok, which is known today as barangay Tambara, the Arab missionary cried out the call to prayer with his loud voice: the first \"adhan\", or \"bang\", in Lanao. The villagers heard this and called it a \"big adhan\", or in the local language, \"\"mala a bang\"\", referring to the coming of Islam to the island. Islam spread through mainland Mindanao soon thereafter. Being marked as the historical foundation of the religion of Islam by inhabitants of central and northern Mindanao, the town was given the name Malabang.\n\nMalabang, in Lanao del Sur, is considered the oldest settlement in mainland Mindanao. \n\nThe Sultanate of T'bok was an established kingdom in present-day Malabang long before the Philippines became a country. The people of Malabang are mostly Maranaos, a tribe indigenous to southern Mindanao; Philippine history books often identify these people as the Iranun tribe. (Iranun is another indigenous tribe of southern Mindanao.) The misconception arose because Iranuns live in some of the barangays in the southern part of Malabang, comprising what is now Balabagan. In March 1969, Executive Order 386, signed by President Carlos P. Garcia, reconstituted the southern part of Malabang as the Municipality of Balabagan. Thus, Iranuns are now residents of Balabagan rather than Malabang.\n\nMalabang played a significant part in the early battles against invaders of the Philippines. During the Spanish conquest, Malabang became the headquarters of Muhammad Kudarat, a great warrior and Sultan of Maguindanao. He used to spend time recuperating in Malabang throughout the period when he was fighting to defend Maguindanao against invasion. He later retired to Malabang when he fell ill. He eventually died and was buried there. In May 1977, Presidential Decree 1135 of President Ferdinand Marcos created the Municipality of Picong (formerly Sultan Gumander) out of the north-western portion of Malabang, where Sultan Kudarat's grave was located.\n\nDuring the Second World War, when the Japanese invaded the Philippines, the Japanese military built a large camp in Malabang, including a network of tunnels around it. It was considered a major camp of the Japanese forces. In 1942, the Philippine Supreme Court Chief Justice José Abad Santos was brought to this camp, after he was captured in Cebu while fleeing from Japanese forces. Chief Justice Abad Santos was executed in the camp for refusing to cooperate with the Japanese, and was buried in barangay Curahab. The place where the camp is situated and where Mr. Santos was executed was later on named Camp Jose Abad Santos (Camp JAS).\n\nIn 1945, United States and Philippine Commonwealth forces, working with Maranao guerillas, occupied Malabang after a siege. During the Siege of Malabang, the guerillas used weapons like the Maranao kris, barong and kampilan to fight the Japanese forces. The victorious American and Philippine Commonwealth troops, together with their Maranao guerrilla allies, eventually defeated the Japanese Imperial forces. When the built of the general headquarters and military camp base of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary was station's active in Malabang from 1945 to 1946 during and ended of World War II.\n\nMalabang as a municipality was founded in March 1, 1893. The locals of the town celebrate the founding day, the \"Araw ng Malabang\" every March 1 annually.\n\nThe languages spoken in Malabang vary by location and by barangay. Maranao is however the prominent language in Malabang, as the native speakers are the original inhabitants of Malabang.\n\nCebuano is spoken in some barangays with significant Cebuano Visayan immigrant populations who are mostly Catholic Christians. Along with English, Cebuano is used in Catholic masses and religious services as Malabang is part of the Prelature of Marawi, subject to the Archdiocese of Ozamiz. \n\nSome descendants of Chinese settlers in China Town (Poblacion) speak Mandarin and to some degree, Hokkien. \n\nEnglish is also a commonly spoken language due to American settlers in Matalin and European missionaries, and is also the medium of instruction and working language of the municipal government. Arabic is used in madrassas and spoken by qualified local and visiting ustadz (Islamic scholar) and imams. Settlers from the Maguindanao, Samal and Tausūg ethnic groups in barangay Bunkhouse still use their tribal tongues.\n\nAlthough there are no settlers from the Tagalog region in Lanao del Sur, Tagalog is still used in schools, being the national language of the Philippines through its national register Filipino. It is also the alternative language of the Maranao townsfolk when conversing with Visayans, since not all of them know how to speak Cebuano.\n\nAgriculture and fishery are the major resources of Malabang. They are also widely known for coconut production. Warehouses of coconut can be found along the major highways of Malabang. Mills in barangay Matalin produce cassava flour. Other agricultural products produced in Malabang include corn, vegetables and rice. Malabang also plays a major role in fishery production. They are known for \"puzan\" (a preserved fish product) and \"bakas\" (smoked dried fish). Malabang is central to commerce and trade activity in the coastal area of Lanao del Sur.\n\nThe municipality has a mayor, the head of the municipality of Malabang, a municipal vice mayor, and eight municipal councilors. The municipality also has one Sangguniang Kabataan (youth council) representative and one ABC representative from the Punong Barangay (barangay captains).\n\n\n\n\nDr. Serapio B. Montañer Memorial District Hospital or known to many as Mabul Hospital is the public hospital in Malabang, and is listed as a secondary hospital in the province. There are also several municipal private clinics in Malabang.\n\nGlobe Telecom and Smart Communications serve the communications needs of the people of Malabang.\n\nAlthough listed as 4th class municipality, all levels of education are attainable in Malabang, a center of learning in the coastal area of Lanao del Sur. Multiple colleges are present, including the community branch of Mindanao State University. Arabic studies are also offered at all levels. Other notable secondary school in Malabang is Our Lady of Peace High School, a Catholic school and Malabang National High School\n\n"}

{"id": "2070518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070518", "title": "St Elisabeth Cathedral", "text": "St Elisabeth Cathedral\n\nThe Cathedral of St Elisabeth (Slovak: \"Dóm svätej Alžbety\" ; Hungarian: \"Szent Erzsébet-székesegyház\", German: \"Dom der heiligen Elisabeth\") is a Gothic cathedral in Košice.\n\nIt is Slovakia's largest church and one of the easternmost Gothic cathedrals in Europe.\n\nThe record of the existence of \"Kassa\" (modern day Košice), dating from 1230, is connected with the existence of the rectory church. In the process of the settlement's transformation from a rural community into a town, all its periods of successes and failures have been reflected in St Elisabeth's Cathedral.\n\nAccording to historical and archaeological sources, the present-day cathedral was built on the place of an earlier church also consecrated to St Elisabeth of Hungary. It was referred to in documents of 1283 and 1290, in which the bishop of Eger Andrew II exempted Košice parish from the dean's sphere of jurisdiction.\n\nSt Elisabeth Cathedral is the largest Church in Slovakia with a total area of and capacity of more than 5000 people. It is the main church in the Košice Archdiocese. It is one of the most eastern Gothic cathedrals in Europe.\n\nThe church is long and wide; the height of the north tower is . The central nave is 24 m long and aisles are 12 m long. Construction of the church influenced builders' activity in surrounding towns such as Prešov, Bardejov, Sabinov, Rožňava and it also influenced construction of other churches in Poland and Transylvania.\n\nThe Gothic Cathedral of Košice consists of the choir with a five-side chavet, five naves, two towers, a level sacristy at the north side, and two chapels and antechapel at the south side. There is a unique inside layout of the church, where the central nave and four aisles are crossed in the middle by one transept of the same height and width as the central nave which altogether create a Greek cross.\n\nThis big central space rises in the centre of the church and together with three equal exterior gables with richly decorated portals belong to the acme of medieval stone work of art in the Middle Europe. The complex of the cathedral and adjacent buildings – St Michael Chapel and Urban Tower were declared as Cultural Heritage Monuments in 1970.\n\nThe oldest Košice church probably originated in the middle of the 11th century and was sacred to Saint Michael. It was built in Romanesque style at the same place as the current church. The church is referred to in the oldest written records of the town dated 1230. When German colonists settled in Košice in the 1240s, and St Elisabeth became the town's patron saint, the church was rededicated to her.\n\nAfter this change the church started to be adjusted in the Gothic Style in the middle of the 13th century. The church retained the Romanesque tower, but it also got a Gothic vault and a side chapel.\n\nThe eastward-oriented chapel measured with a main aisle of , giving it a total area of . This parish church burned down around 1380, but it was rebuilt and kept in service until the construction of the current cathedral. Several Romanesque artifacts such as Iva statuette, a bronze baptistery and the several gravestones remain up to this day.\n\nThe fire which destroyed St Elisabeth church in 1380 was a good opportunity for the construction of a new church. Wealthy local citizens financed the construction of a cathedral with the active support of monarch Sigismund of Luxemburg.\n\nHe devoted a considerable amount of money to the construction. Building of a church was also supported by papal curia. In 1402, Pope Boniface IX issued the indulgence bull. All pilgrims who contributed to Košice's church had their sins forgiven. The exact date of a new church construction is unknown, but it is supposed to be between 1380 (fire of old church) and 1402 when there was a first written record. The first stage of construction works lasted probably until 1420.\n\nDuring this period the church was built as a five-nave basilica. The construction was done in a way that new cathedral was built around the original foundation. The south polygonal chevet of aisles were built as the first ones. This was followed by the south enclosure wall construction, the south portal and the west wall where first two levels of both towers were composed to floor plan of church.\n\nAn advanced construction margin related to Silesian Gothic, which took part in the Franciscan church construction in the north part of town, was working at building of a new church. There exists a reference from 1411 about director Mikuláš and about Sigismund's master builder Peter from Budin.\n\nA discontinuous innovation in a cathedral conception was brought by new construction masonry in 1420. Because of a lack of written reference the architect of construction masonry is anonymous. Ambition of uprightness, light materials and spaciousness of church resulted in construction of the three-aisle cathedral, whereby the essential change of plan was added by the counter aisles to the main nave.\n\nThis was situated unconventionally to the middle of the main nave length by which a unique central hall space was created. The statue portal decoration of a main nave and side aisles were inspired by Gothic buildings in Prague and Kraków, and was included in the second construction stage. The influence of Parleř masonry at Prague's Saint Vitus Cathedral in the second half of the 14th century became evident in the King's Oratory and its spiral staircase as well as a motif of round banisters of oratory and a stone gallery over the sacristy.\n\nThen building of the cathedral continued with the north external wall construction, the polygonal chevet of the north aisle (parallels of south apsids) and eight-sided top levels of the Sigimund's tower. At the end of the second construction stage the cathedral was ready for vaulting and it was necessary to pull down the old church. St Michael's church (today called St Michael's Chapel) was built at the same time as the new church, but it was finished in 1400, and it took over the function of a parish church.\n\nAfter the demolition of the old church of St Elisabeth, the church was vaulted by stellar vault. The particular symmetric shapes of the vault bays were different from each other and they were not folded from one bay to the other. The newest part of the construction – sacristy and chapel belong to this third construction stage.\n\nThe Sigimund's tower was finished and a new town erb granted by Ladislaus the Posthumous was sculpted at the fifth floor of tower in 1453. The date 1462, sculpted over the entrance portal to the tower, is the year when work on the tower was finished.\n\nAfter finishing the Sigimund's tower, attention turned to the building of the south tower, which was named after the monarch of that time and contributor to the building of tower Matthias Corvinus. This tower was built in a more decorated and vertical style than the north tower of the cathedral, because the construction masonry had changed.\n\nAt the same time the south shield and portal were finished and there are many elements that recognize Matthias' generosity. Between 1464–90, Master Stephan Lapicidus or Master Štefan Staimecz from Košice, mentioned in documents, was working on the cathedral construction.\n\nMaster Štefan built side aisles of the cathedral that were not included in an origin floor plan. It was financed by rich city-dweller families. The Saint Cross Chapel was built by senator August Cromer in 1475. The Saint Maria chapel was built by Satmary Rod in 1477 and by the end of the same century The Saint Joseph Chapel (which no longer exists) was built at the north side of the cathedral.\n\nAn inside feature from this period is a work of Master Stephan – the stone pastophorium, and probably the relief of St Elisabeth at the sacristy wall as well. At that time the church was furnished by rich Gothic mobiliari, from which not too much was kept until today. The main altar of Saint Elisabeth between 1474–77 from the unknown artist has been preserved.\n\nAfter Matthias Corvinus' death began the contest of the throne in Hungary. At that time Polish-Latvian regent John I Albert attacked Košice city. It was the first time that Košice was shot by cannons. The church was heavily damaged, and Nikolaus Krumpholz from Niš was charged with its reconstruction. Master builder Vaclav from Prague assisted him with the reconstruction. According to the documents from the era at cordon of the west façade the reconstruction was done between 1496–98.\n\nIn 1508, the presbytery was completed; this is considered to be the year when the cathedral construction was finished. This fact is documented by the scroll of parchment with the particular year and the name of master builder Krumpholz which was found in the presbytery pillar after the big reconstruction of the church in 1908.\n\nIn 1556, Košice was affected by a huge fire which damaged the cathedral as well. The church roof, timbers of the roof and a large part of interior were burnt. All the necessary repairs were done by master builder Stanislaus from Kraków, master builders Johann and Gebriel and stone master Matyas.\n\nAfter this the church was administered by Protestants. They owned the church until 1604 when it was violently garrisoned by Catholics, along with Eger's chapter house. This incident became one of the main reason of anti-Habsburg revolt of Stephen Bocskai who devoted the church to Calvinists.\n\nThe church was returned to Eger's chapter house in 1671 by Emperor Leopold I's decision. During this time the necessary repairs were done and a chapter house treasure was placed in the church. During Count Imre Thököly de Késmárk's revolt (1682–85) the church was claimed by Protestants. In 1685, the church was permanently restored to the Catholic community.\n\nIn 1706 the church was damaged during the Francis II Rákóczi occupation. The most damaged parts were the west and the south side of the church. During the 18th century several parts of the church were fixed and embellished. \nIn the second half of the 18th century the church already had 14 altars (with comparison to the 10 that exist today). Baroque–Rococo helmet with sightseeing view obtained the Sigimund's tower after the fire in 1775.\n\nAfter several years of religious wars and neglected maintenance it was necessary to update the cathedral at the beginning of the 19th century. There were earthquakes in 1834 and in 1845; the town was flooded and the flood extended to the cathedral where several parts of the ground pavement were damaged. During the 19th century there was an initiative for the cathedral reconstruction in Neo-Gothic style, which was organised by Bishop Ignác Fábry, and Imre Henszlmann, an artist and monuments innovator in Hungary.\n\nIn 1857, the St Elisabeth Cathedral Alliance was established by the members who were devoted to cathedral repairs which took place from 1856–63 under the control of the Emperor's Royal Central Commission of Preservation and Repair of Architectural Monuments and as well as under the assistance of Henszlmann.\n\nWorks were laid out by master builders Károly Gerster and Lajos Frey. Fábry's reconstruction effected change of several portals' statues, clapboards to ceramic roof-tiles, stock of new window panes, repair of the south hall and Romantique interior painting.\n\nOn the other hand, very important structural defects of the church which were evident at that time were not removed and repaired. Some of the columns were off center from their central line. Their bases were standing on a colour blade layer which was soaked by ground water. Arch ruptures were covered by mortar or were covered by wood. Such an unprofessional practise led to the destruction and state of disrepair after a big windstorm in 1875.\n\nIn 1872, the Hungarian Temporary Monuments Commission was established, with Imre Henszlmann was the commission secretary. A major reconstruction was realized from 1877–96 and was the main priority of the Monuments Commission. It was financed mostly from the state budget of the Hungarian government. Imre Steindl, a professor of Medieval Architecture of Budapest Technical University and the most famous architect of the Hungarian neo-Gothic, was named as the main architect of the reconstruction works.\n\nBased on the ruptures in arches he decided that pillars' allocation in the aisles was the main reason for the state of a disrepair of the cathedral statics. He worked out a completely new purist projection of the cathedral's reconstruction where the three-aisle cathedral was rebuilt to a five-aisle cathedral and added arches in side aisles.\n\nOriginally medieval star arches at the main as well as the side aisles were rebuilt to network ones. An old choir was removed and on its place Steindl built expanded replicas with more pillars. The next works involved the exterior – adjusting the external walls and gavels, supporting the columns, the water-chutes and windows' carved works, the portals' decoration and the change of Matthias' tower roof.\n\nThe late-Gothic St Joseph's Chapel at the north part of the cathedral was completely removed. A neo-Gothic tower which was crossing the main and the side aisles, flèche was created. Steindl's primary plan was to rebuild all the neo-Gothic additional building and components in the cathedral. But those suggestions were declined by the commission and they requested a cheaper exchange of old stone parts for the new ones. Re-Gothicisation of the towers was not realized due to a lack of funds, reflected in a cheaper construction material. During the Exchange of a base system from 1878–82 cheap but low-quality sandstone from the nearby Spiššké Vlachy stone-pit was used. Its quick dilapidated outer surface resulted in removal of pinnacles and gargoyles because they endangered pedestrians. With the next reconstruction after 1882 good quality sandstone from Banská Bystrica was used. The main Master builder of the major reconstruction from 1877–80 was Josepf Weber.\n\nFrom 1880–96, Friedrich Wilhelm Fröde from Vienna was the main master builder. Supervision was done by Austrian architect Friedrich von Schmidt. After that a famous architect, Schmidt's student, Imre Steindl had started to work on Budapest parliament (in 1885), and Otto Sztehló became his successor. This architect used a preservative method at the Matthias tower in contrast with the previous purist method of his forerunners. The Sigimund's tower, the Matthias tower (except the roof), the inner side of exterior walls, the Medieval portals with reliefs, the stone inventory of interior and the whole chapel (just the interior part) were kept from neo-Gothic reconstruction.\n\nIn 1896 a newly delivered neo-Gothic interior equipment (altars, statues, pictures) was bought and donated for Košice's Cathedral by Hungarian clergy, Bishop of Kassa and maecenas Zsigmond Bubics. In 1906, a cathedral crypt was built under the north side aisle according to project of Hungarian architect Frigyes Schulek. This crypt was prepared for enclosing relics of Francis II Rákóczi and his companions from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn 1970, St Elisabeth Cathedral was declared a National Cultural Monument. All the profiled architectural features (pinnacles, gargoyles, gadroons) had been either destroyed by the rain water or were unmounted. The stone decoration at the north portal was very much affected by weathering. Cathedral reconstruction started again in September 1978 with detailed architectural documentation. After a short break, works started again in 1984.\n\nIn the meantime authorities started with the complex solution of Košice centrum monuments innovation, which was in 1983 declared as the biggest town monuments reservation in Slovakia. One of the factors that contributed to higher care of church was excluding motor-vehicle traffic from the main street in 1984 and tram traffic in 1986.\n\nDuring the reconstruction it was decided to use a method of a maintaining the stage from the big reconstruction at the end of the 19th century. First the roof of the main and side aisles was repaired where the ceramic coloured enamel tiles were changed, but with the original pattern from the 19th century. The flèche was reconstructed and it was necessary to add 264 pieces of lead decorations.\n\nFrom 1980–92 the most damaged part of the chapel and sacristy were reconstructed. The works were done by the Polish company Polskie Pracownie Konserwacji Zabytków from Vratislav. It was necessary to construct the new crown gardoons, gargoyles and pinnacles – according to the accessible documents and projects from the town's archival collection. Similarly the staircase towers were done. The gargoyles' reconstruction was done according to original Medieval patterns which are retained in the museums. This reconstruction included the interior repair of a chapel.\n\nIn 1992–95 the south façade (cleaning and preservation), including windowpanes was done. The Sigimund's tower was under consistent renovation in 1995–97 when a rococo copper helmit was replaced. Cleaned and gilded plumbing decorations are originals from 1775. In 2008 reconstruction of the Rákóczi crypt was finished and in 2009 reconstruction of the most precious north portal was finished.\n\nToday there is renovation work at the exterior of the north façade of the church and the west portal and interior of the crossed north aisle. The Matthias tower is awaiting reconstruction.\n\nThe base of the space composition is formed by the central nave with five bays which is divided by the cross aisle with one bay in axis. Apparent substitution of an idea are four subordinate spaces, inset into the ground plan of the building and inserted between the arms of main and cross aisle. In the first decades probably the enclosure walls were built and the main outline of space disposition was finished.\n\nIn the next few years the question of portals and arches construction should have been solved. In the original spirit of the architecture the excellent stone sculpture works from 1420–40 enriched construction structure with three big portals. The north, the south, and west portals in Košice have difficult profiles, eventuated in dynamic curves, alternating by horizontal and vertical cornices of relief boards and were decoratively enriched by pinnacles. Those architectural works through profile ceiling and allow new ideas using decorative views and play of light and shadow.\n\nAs is seen from the reconstruction of V. Mencl, the conception of the figural vaulting is based on individual parts of split arcades' curves and inter vault parts. Their shapes' difficult play is formed by the scheme of the sun rising with its spikes out of the splitting columns. For each sun an individual pattern of its middle is very important. From its diagonal vectors it creates shapes of the cross, rhombus and the trapezoid.\n\nIn the subordinate spaces, which are clutched by the arms of main Greek cross of the main aisle and the side aisle, at connecting walls and the east side, the sun scheme is lost in a tangle of cranked rib networks. Master Štefan built a sacrarium over the anteroom at the south wall and he is adding adoration to the chapel of St Cross to its east side and chapel of Mettercia to the west side. At the north side there is the chapel of St Joseph. In these parts the ribs do not reach the head of the lisena but they gather to the arch construction. The vaulting of the chapels is based on an irregular star net vault.\n\nMaster Ján of Prešov demolished old walls and suggested an atrial type which can be seen mostly at the triple aisle. As from the artistic point of view he used efficiency of the smooth walls and the large windows in order to whiten the interior.\n\nFrom the main altar towards the west gate is decorated by windows of the main altar with heraldries of Košice, Abov's chair and Hunyady chair as well as the heraldry of the countries of the 15th century King Matthias Corvinus: Dalmatia, The Big Bulgaria, Transylvania, Hungary, Serbia, Slavonia, Croatia, Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia.\n\nThis altar was crafted in the period of 1474–77 and is ranked among the most remarkable monuments of Medieval art in Slovakia. The two pairs of both-side decorated wings each containing six Gothic paintings are adjoined to the central part. As a whole, it is a set of 48 paintings in three themed cycles – Elisabethan, the Passion and the Advent. Such construction of an altar is unique even in the European scale.\n\nThe winged altar was crafted to the order of a rich merchant of Košice named Michal Gunthert in 1516. The guiding motif of the altar, located in the arche, is a sculpture of the visit of Mary with Elisabeth. On both sides, the altar has a pair of movable wings. When opened, they represent scenes of the Angelic salutation, the Nativity, the Adoration of the Magi and the Flight to Egypt.\n\nWhen closed, they depict the sacred personages Saint Catherine, John the Baptist, Saint Barbara and John the Apostle. The predella is painted with votives of Vir dolorum, Virgin Mary, John the Evangelist, Saint Michael the Archangel and Margaret the Virgin.\n\nThe latter were patrons of the Gunthert family. Like the main altar of Saint Elisabeth, the upper part of this altarpiece is late Gothic and decorated with the three groups of sculptures: the legend of three marriages of Saint Anne, statues of the Apostles and of Mary on the top.\n\nThe character of this altarpiece lies in the fact that it is composed of the two late-Gothic altarpieces from the first half of the 16th century, which were saved after a great fire of the city of Košice in 1556.\n\nThe paintings on wings are the oldest dated of the all altarpiece paintings in the cathedral. They depict 16 saints on the both sides. In 1860, the altar image of Anthony of Padua painted by Ferenc Klimkovics was placed in the original arch.\n\nThe Neo-gothic altarpiece from the end of the 19th century was manufactured to order of Bishop Zsigmond Bubics, for the purpose of emplacement of new-found late gothic painting of Mettercia. The rare painting of Tyrolean origin from 1516 depicts Saint Anne and the ancestry of Isaiah.\n\nThe painting was made for a commission from the family of pharmacist Bartolomej Czottman, and his wife and he are depicted with their coats of arms, among which the coat of arms of Košice is placed in accordance to the latest grant of arms. A mortar, as a symbol of pharmacists is featured beyond the municipal coat of arms.\n\nIt is one of the series of neo-Gothic altarpieces from 1896 bought for the cathedral on the occasion of the millennial celebration of the Hungarian's arrival to the homeland, as well as of the termination of restoration works. The altarpiece was a gift from incumbent Bishop Zsigmond Bubics.\n\nBought in Paris, it was a gift from Bishop Zsigmond Bubics in 1896.\n\nA gift from Konstantin Schuster, the bishop of Vác, in 1896. It was crafted of pieces bought in Brussels by Lajos Lantay, a sculptor from Pöstyén.\n\nA gift from František Pogač, the canon of Košice, in 1896. Crafted by Ferdinand Stufflesser, the Tyrolean carver.\n\nThe Three Martyrs of Košice were beatified in 1905, Lajos Tihanyi. Crafted the altarpiece dedicated to them in 1923 in Banská Bystrica. Their remains are stored in the predella.\n\nIt is historically the newest altarpiece in the cathedral, crafted in Košice in 1931 by Vojtech Buchner in commemoration of victims of the World War I. Two iron panels feature names of all the people who contributed to the construction of the altarpiece.\n\nA triptych altarpiece from the last third of the 15th century is segmented in the deposit of the East Slovak Museum.\n\nA neo-Gothic altarpiece crafted for a rare oil tempera painted panel from 1516. It was installed in the cathedral until 1944. After reconstruction work from 1965–70 the panel was obtained by the East Slovak Museum.\n\nOne side of the panel depicts scene of the Baptism of Christ in Jordan and the other depicts the torture of Saint John. They are of high quality with a notable impact of the Dutch and Flemish renaissance.\n\nAn original Gothic altarpiece which was not installed in 1943. Only the predella was preserved, which is lost in the archival store of the cathedral.\n\nThe Roman-Gothic baptistery from the 14th century is the oldest monument preserved in the cathedral. It comes from the old church of Saint Elisabeth, the ancestor of today's cathedral. The leg of the baptistery is decorated with triangles, and the chalice is ornamented with zoomorphic reliefs of lions, gryphons and eagles. The upper brim is lined with an illegible Latin inscription. The lid dates back to 1914.\n\nIn 1892, during the large-scale reconstruction works, a number of original Gothic frescoes was discovered hidden under a layer of plaster since the period of Reformation. Three of them are in the south apse: The Savior on the Day of Judgement in an aureola (sitting Christ holding a sword, Mary and Saint Peter below him), Twelve Apostles and the Resurrection of Christ (with his right hand holding a battalion and blessing with his left hand).\n\nIn the northern side apse next to the entry of sacristy another set of genuine Gothic frescoes could be found: the Descent from the Cross, dating back to the 16th century, conceived as winged wall altarpiece. Paintings on the right side are the Flagellation and the Coronation with Crown of thorns, and on the left side Christ nailed at the cross and Christ before Pilate.\n\nThe sculpture of Calvary dating back to 1420 is one of the oldest articles of cathedral's inventory. Its components are: 4.34m tall cross with 3.12m tall nailed Christ in the centre, 2.73m tall statue of Mary on the right side and 2.5-metre-tall statue of John the Evangelist on the left.\n\nOriginally, the group of statues was installed in triumphal arch of the nave until 1936, when it was reinstalled in the Royal Oratory. This monumental carved wood piece of art is notable for its deep theatricality of emotional expression of the Christian Period culture.\n\nThe four wood carvings crafted around 1470, whose authorship is attributed to Jan Weysz, the woodcarver from Presov, correspond to the period style of the main altarpiece of Saint Elisabeth.\n\nThe sculptures are 108–112 cm tall and their current installation is secondary, i.e. in the choir's pillars of the western portal. Originally they probably formed a component of an unpreserved upper part of St Elisabeth's altarpiece. The sculptures represent Saint Stephen, his son Saint Emeric of Hungary, Saint Ladislaus and Stanislaus of Szczepanów, the Polish bishop.\n\nA polychromed wood carving from the period of 1500 112 cm tall. It is installed on a late Gothic twisted column. Above the statue, a Gothic ciborium was inserted into the southern side wall. The expressiveness and the pleating of the gown attest to the high level of late Gothic wood-carving in Košice.\n\nThe pinnacle with a niche for lantern built on a stone twisted column dates back to the end of the 15th century. The pinnacles' tympanums are ornamented with the coat of arms of Košice, Kingdom of Hungary, of Czech and Dalmatia.\n\nOne unidentified coat of arms is present as well as the one of the Hunyadi family. Originally, the lamp illuminated the area in front of the southern portal towards the neighbouring cemetery. It served its purpose until the early 20th century when it was adapted to gas lighting. It was installed in its current place on the tower wall of Matthias in 1940.\n\nThe pipe organ choir was completely replaced in the period of large-scale reconstruction works in the end of the 19th century. The current replica is a bit longer and has more pillars than the original one. Four polychromed sculptures described above are installed on the pillars and complemented with another four neogothic sculptures of Kings of Hungary: Charles I of Hungary, Louis I of Hungary, Sigismund of Luxemburg and Matthias Corvinus.\n\nA new pipe organ was crafted by Angster from Patkostolie. Access to it is through a stairway in the southern tower. The original one was discovered on Košice by a collector, Austrian Count Johann Nepomuk Wilczek who bought it and had it transported to his castle Burg Kreuzenstein near Vienna.\n\nA stone pastophorium for storing the eucharist, which is located in the northern pillar of triumphal arch, is the most accurate stone masonry work in the cathedral. It was crafted by Master Štefan around 1477. The pastophorium with hexagonal plan is ornated with complex composition of pillars moldings, friezes, arcades and arches.\n\nThe twisted niche for storing the eucharist is located on the first floor pastophorium. The metal-tipped door decorated with thumbnails of coat of arms of some lands and noblemen dates back to the 15th century. The tiny plaster sculptures of prophets and kneeling angels replaced former missing parts in the end of the 19th century. Since the Council of Trent, the pastophorium had become redundant and thus the staircase leading to the pastophorium lost its purpose and was removed in 1860.\n\nIt originated in the same period as the stone pastophorium and the authorship is also attributed to Master Štefan. It is made of three parts which do not fit together because of their compositions. The relief by itself is decorated in abrupt manner in a contrast with hexagonal ciborium with bolt ending with filigree scenes from the Old Testament.\n\nThe tip of the ciborium in the shape of the pinnacle is ended with composition of nestled pelican which is the symbol of Christ's blood. In the 19th century the relief was complemented with a Latin inscription \"S.Elisabeth ora pro nobis\" positioned above the console.\n\nThe Baroque epitaph of the family of municipal reeve Rainer Melichar is one of the few Neo-gothic relics preserved in the cathedral and dates back to the beginning of the 17th century. The image of Flagellation is between two family coats of arms; above, there is a sculpture of Christ Crucified and above the tympanum, there is a Baroque group of sculptures of two angels on the sides and Christ holding the Earth in the middle.\n\nAnother Baroque relic in the cathedral which appropriately exponentiates the aesthethic interior décor is hanging aureole from the first half of the 18th century, installed under the triumphal arch. The double-sided sculpture of Madonna with child is in the middle of the aureole.\n\nSome of the cathedral pews are from the 18th century and crafted in Baroque style, other are from the end of the 19th century. Oppositely positioned canonical pews in presbytery were crafted during the period of the large-scale reconstruction works of the cathedral in accordance with the design of the main architect Imrich Steindl. He designed the patronal pew of communs with an engraved painted coat of arms of Košice.\n\nOne of the two chapels in the cathedral is the Chapel of Annunciation to the blessed Virgin Mary located in the area between Matthias Corvinus' tower and the vestibule of the southern portal. It was built in 1477 by Stefan and allegedly his portrait is on the console of cross-ribbed vaults. The builder holds a paper strip in his hands. The altarpiece of Mettercia is installed in the chapel, hence the other name.\n\nThe parents of the Hungarian primate Juraj Szatmary had it built, hence the chapel is also called the Chapel of Szatmary. In the beginning of the 19th century, a crypt of bishops of Košice was established under its floor. Their gravestones are embedded into the enclosure walls. Ignac Fabry, Zsigmond Bubics, Augustin Fischer-Colbrie and Jozef Čársky are buried there.\n\nThe second Chapel of the Dome is the Chapel of Saint Cross also built in year 1475. Its donor was the city consul and reeve Augustín Cromer, the reason that the chapel is also called Cromer's chapel. Nowadays it is used as the sacristy.\n\nTo the period of building the old cathedral belongs the construction of the King's Oratory. It was created on the first floor of the polygonal arch of the south annex of transept aisle. On the wall under the oratory is a very significant epigrafic relic from the acting time of John Jiskra of Brandýs in the function of Košice captain.\n\nThe twisted staircase is from the 15th century and leads to the king's empora. The stairs are divided into two arms of staircase and the west arm heads to the attic of cathedral.\n\nIt is constrained and therefore it is assumed it had mainly decorative function. This twisted staircase is the oldest existing one in Europe.\n\nThe stone gallery located on the north wall of the main aisle in place of a presbytery belongs to the original accommodation of the cathedral. Its purpose was likely to present different medieval allegories and mysteries during the worship ceremony by actors and singers.\n\nSaint Florian was the patron of firemen and protection from fire. The town built his statue in 1748, which first stood near St Michael's Church (later Chapel), later on near the south wall of St Urban Tower, until the year 1940 when it was moved to where it now stands at the entrance hall of the south portal.\n\nBuilding of the adyton belongs to the third part of construction of the Dome, the years 1440–62. In addition there are neo-Gothic statues on the consoles from Jana Marschalek from the end of 19th century. They represent saints. Windowpanes were created by Karl Geyling in Vienna in 1860. On the panes are illustrated coats of arms of minor canons.\n\nThe newest element of the cathedral's inventory is the sacrificial altar of the celebrating priest. It is located in the front of the main altar, and is carved from a single piece of sandstone in the shape of two arms creating an ellipse.\n\nThe sacrificial altar stands on the tabernacle of the shape of a heart. Near the altar is a new ambon (place for preaching) and the sedeses (chairs). All the three objects were created by Michael and Thomas Baník in 1994.\n\nThe stone pulpit with wooden shelter is the masterpiece of sculptors W. Aubram and R. Argenti. On the twisted staircase to it are placed statues of the argurs and the church fathers.\n\nBeside the north wall of the Dome a crypt was built in 1906 for remains of Francis II Rákoczi, Hungarian nobleman and Prince of Transylvania and his family and favored friends. The crypt and the four stone sarcophagi were designed by professor Frigyes Schulek from Budapest.\n\nIn one sarcophagus are buried together the prince, his mother (Ilona Zrínyi), and his older son Joseph. South is the sarcophagus of General Count Antal Esterházy, north is where Miklós Sibrik is interred. In the fourth sarcophagus on the other side of crypt Count Miklós Bercsényi and his second wife, Krisztina Csáki are buried.\n\nThe monumental mural painting above the north portal of the cathedral is from years 1914–16 and its author is Andor Dudics (or Dudits). It is a triptych.\n\nDesign of the north portal is rare according to medieval tradition in which the north sides of churches did not have portals. Its statues are the most decorative out of the three portals of the cathedral. The reason for this is probably its facing the busiest part of medieval Košice-to the city market and the city hall. The portal is known as The Golden Gate, because it was gilded in the Middle Ages. The north portal has two entrance doors. Above those is an arch with a relief of The Last Judgement.\n\nThe relief is divided into two parts. In the lower one is seen a crowd of people heading to the gates of heaven, where they are welcomed by an angel, and the others who are going to hell are heading to the leviathan's jaws with devils and are in chains. The upper part shows the Last Judgement, the two angels with horns announcing the end of the world. The other figures represent the 12 apostles. Around the relief of the Last Judgement is in three degrees placed five frame reliefs decorated by pinnacles, profilation and traceried motives. Two lower reliefs refer to the life of St Elisabeth. The other three recreate the scene from Calvary.\n\nAt the top is Christ crucified on the cross in a shape of tree of life. The other two crucified on Golgotha are shown on the left side as the saved soul carried to heaven by an angel, while on the right side the soul is carried to hell by a devil. Under the scene of Crucifixion on the left side are crying women around Virgin Mary under the cross and on the right side is John the Evangelist surrounded by Roman soldiers. During the great reconstruction of the dome they added niches along the both gates of north portal for Neo-gothic statues of the saints.\n\nThe niches are original and it is not known what statues stood on them during the last centuries. The other Neo-Gothic statues decorate the portal of the east gavel. The statues are Ugarian kings Charles I of Hungary, his wife Elisabeth of Poland and Louis of Hungary. They are masterpieces of the Budapest sculptor Lajos Lantay.\n\nAccording to liturgical custom the main entrance to the church is the west portal. Although it has three gates, this entrance has the most simple stone decoration. Two sides are without figure decoration. Above the main gate are two reliefs. One of them directly over the gate shows Christ in Getsemane garden piteously praying to His Father.\n\nTo the left of Christ are apostles Peter, John and Jacob, from the right come soldiers led by Judas. In the seddle finish of the portal is the scene of Pieta, Virgin Mary holding Christ body, surrounded by Maria Magdalene and Mary Joseph. The uppermost relief shows angels holding Veronica's towel with Christ's face print.\n\nThe whole symbology of portals relates with local tradition of The Holy Blood. At the end of 19th century two Neo-Gothic statues were placed to the main gate of which only one – the statue of John the Baptist has been preserved.\n\nThe south portal differs from the previous two portals by the fact that it is placed to the ante-room under the king's empora. It has two gates, the same as the north portal, but without the figures in relief. Instead they are finished by saddles with triangle circling pikes above which is another row of saddles. The portal gives the impression of a triple level entrance to the cathedral.\n\nAn interesting component of the portal is aerial bolt of gothic arch of an Ante–room with leaf ornaments. Very interesting is also the baldachin of the statue in the middle of the portal which is formed by flying rooks. The other rook and beast hold devices of the torment. Based on this it is supposed that under the baldachin was previously a statue of Christ.\n\nToday there is statue of Imaculata from the end of the 19th century made by statue maker John Marschalko. The other statues at the portal are saints, emperor Constantine the Great, Elizabeth of Hungary, Adalbert of Prague, the Apostle Andrew (patron of Košice archdiocese), Xavier and Bishop Teodor.\n\nThese statues have nothing to do with the symbolism of the portal; they represent patrons and those who financed the major reconstruction of the Cathedral at the end of the 19th century. The middle portrait belongs to architect Imrich Steindl. The others included Fridrich Wilhelm Fröde and Otto Sztehló.\n\nThe north tower, which was built in the second period of church construction in 1420–40, was finished in the third period of construction in 1462. This is proved by Košice's arms with the sculpted year 1462 over the portal of the west façade which is also the entrance to the tower. The tower stays at four – square floor plan and has three levels. From the fourth level it narrows to an octagonal floor plan.\n\nA simply decorated tower has between floor cordons decorated by cresting with a geometric motif. Between the fourth and the fifth floor the decoration is complemented by rosette – roses, while each of them is profiled to the different shape. The Sigimund's tower was heavily damaged between 1490–91 when Košice was besieged by John I Albert's army. It was reconstructed by Mikuláš Crompholz from Niš, under the guidance of Vaclav from Prague in 1494–97.\n\nAfter the fire in 1775 the tower was built up a little bit and on the top of it a Rococo monkshood was mounted, which created the sixth floor of the tower.\n\nThe monkshood is covered by a copper sheet with the gold-coated plumber components. On the top of it there is copper cross 3 meters tall. On the first floor there is the mechanism of a large clock, on the second floor there is construction for the bells. On the third floor are two bells from 1926. Alexander Buchner had new bells cast – The God's heard which has 1 530 kg and which holds names of those killed during World War I. There is also a fire brigade room which was used until the 1970s.\n\nThe south tower was built in the second period of cathedral construction from 1420–40. It had a fourth – square floor plan. After the construction break the work on building the tower followed in 1462 when the north tower was finished. The works were managed by Master Štefan until 1477.\n\nHe constructed it in a more decorated and massive way in comparison with the north tower, although it was not built up to its planned height. It is finished at a level of crown cordon of the main aisle by decorative wreath with heraldries of countries belonging to King Matthias and heraldry of Košice.\n\nThe tower is now covered by an octagon metal-sheet roof. The curiosity of the tower is a labyrinth of a circular staircase which are linked to each other. Its importance has not been clarified. The entrance is from the west choir of the cathedral and its staircase also allows access to the pipe organ. The rich decoration of the exterior is complemented by the statues of Matthias Corvinus's supporters which are from Budapest sculptor František Mikula from the 20th century.\n\nOn the exterior wall of the south façade above the biggest window of the Mettercie Chapel is situated the horologe type sun dial type from the year 1477.\n\nThe tower at the crosspoint of the main and the transept aisle is the product of the neo-Gothic remaking while the great reconstruction of the dome at the end of the 19th century. It has a wooden skeleton which is metaled by copper.\n\nIn 1906, the remains of Francis II Rákóczi and his band were carried from Turkey to Košice and entombed in the Cathedral Crypt.\n\nOn 24 July 1938, the memorial of the Kuruc Revolt was unveiled. The memorial was designed by Sipos and Vojtech Loffler. Vojtech Buchner moulded it with bronze.\n\nIn the Middle Ages and during modern times Saint Elisabeth Cathedral was the largest church in the Kingdom of Hungary. Its building happened to be a very prestigious issue for the bourgeois, wealthy merchants and craftsmen of Košice.\n\nOver the years legends of the cathedral were created and maintained. Most of them have their roots in the Middle Ages of building the dome. Construction continuing over the centuries gave birth to the legend of the hollow stone, which the builders put on an unknown place in the cathedral. If the stone was lost, the whole cathedral would fall.\n\nThere is also a legend about the gargoyle of the drunk women – it is said that she was the master builder's alcoholic wife. The legend says that because she was tarnishing his reputation by her appearance in the town, he made her a gargoyle forever.\n\nThere is a legend about the lantern of King Matthias. The lantern was said to have a power to take away the guilt from every criminal who stood under it.\n\nThe last legend is about Christ's blood. During the common Sunday mass the priest spilt the consecrated goblet full of wine on the floor where the image of suffering Christ was created, and some believers heard the Christ moan, they said.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is located in the first district of the province of Lanao del Sur, Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and has total land area of 340.09 square kilometers distributed over the 37 barangays that are predominantly populated by Maranao people.\n\nThe municipality was named Piagapo as the word relates closely to several royal houses of the Pat A Pangampong a Ranao. It is believed that during the ancient time, Piagapo was territorial land originally ruled by a queen ruler “Dayang Labi\", a direct descendant of Sharief Kabungsuan, the first Muslim missionary who landed in Maguindanao to spread the religion Islam. Being queen ruler of the land, she was popularly enthroned and widely known as the “Bai sa Radapan”. Furthermore, to retain her name and legacy in the history of Piagapo, one of the Barangays was named after her title as the Bai sa radapan. It was called Radapan. This is the place where most of her descendants reside. Moreover, claimants of the sultanate leadership in the different areas of Piagapo usually trace up their genealogical origin from the progenitor, the Bai sa Radapan. Only her progeny can claim a royal title. The Municipality of Piagapo was once a component of the Municipality of Saguiaran, Lanao del Sur. On March 17, 1957, the president signed Executive Order No. 431 creating Piagapo into a municipal district which took effect effectively. The name Piagapo was proposed by a group of leaders from Sendigan led by Sultan a Diamla and presented by Mangompia S. Gunting. The name Piagapo was unanimously adopted as the name of the municipal district. Piagapo was then converted into a regular municipality on July 1, 1965, by virtue of Executive Order No. 166 signed on August 27, 1965. Piagapo also divided into three districts: Sundigan A Piagapo, Pat a Panoroganan, Bubonga Marantao and composed of 37 barangay.\n\nPiagapo is one of the Municipalities suffered and receiving Evacuees from municipality of Munai and municipality of Tangcal during Martial Law in 1972.\nAlmost Evacuees living in Munai at the time were abandoned their home, livestock, land, etc. and they moved to boundary somewhere in Lanao del Sur and Lanao del Norte.\nMost of the people stay meanwhile to Barangay Lininding of Munai, a boundary of Municipality of Piagapo, Lanao del Sur. The only remaining people that time of evacuation process were the Moro (Male and Female including Children) Fighter and one of their Leader Commander was Commander Tagoranao \"AKA James Bond\" Macapaar bin Sabbar, a MNLF Top Commander for Lanao del Norte. Late Commander James Bond is the sibling of MILF Top Commander Abdullah Macapaar \"Commander Bravo\". Moro Rebels from Munai had a fight side-by-side with the Moro Rebels from neighboring Tangkal against Philippines Constabulary (PC) Army.\n\nAfter peaceful was process in the middle of 1980s, The Team of MILF Commander Sultan Saifudin Romandiar Tomawis and MILF Commander Sultan Tagoranao Goldiano Macapaar bin Sabbar along with the MILF Commander Sansarona from Maguindanao had stay and made a Temporary \"MILF Camp Bansayan\" in Bansayan, a barangay of Piagapo until end of EDSA Revolution on 1986. During the stay, there were enormous battle between MILF forces and Government Forces. Both MILF Commanders had went to Afghanistan to join the war against Russian on 1984. The said Camp was abandoned by MILF Soldiers when civilian had given the map and provide with guide the Government Forces when that MILF Camp on early EDSA Revolution. On the Attack of Government Forces, they come secretly at night in barangay bansayan and they stay at the near of the MILF Camp Bansayan for almost 10hrs until 3:00AM and strike the Camp. The One of the Field Commander who stay long and withdraw later to fight is Commander Abiden Dimacuta Umpar because he handle .30 Machine Gun.\n\nPiagapo being part of Lanao del Sur has predominantly cold climate. The climate observed in the community is very unpredictable where rainfalls are mostly observed during the month of July, August, September and October. Dry season is observed during summer the month of March, April and May. The Municipality is hilly and mountainous. The beautiful mountains with vast trees in the area serve as natural barriers against typhoon and strong wind and other natural calamities.\n\nThe area is hilly and mountainous with scattered plain areas suitable for agricultural activities. These plain portions are either upland or lowland. It is rich in natural resources such as wide vast of forest area with varieties of good trees, rivers, springs and streams that have good potentials for further development. However, the local government unit should pay attention on the issues regarding illegal logging and kainging otherwise the community would be prone to erosion and landslides that will endanger many lives. The natural resources of the Municipality especially its wide and diverse forest should be protected and preserved.\n\nPiagapo is divided into 3 districts and composed of 37 barangays.\nBubonga Marantao:\n\nPat A Panoroganan:\n\nSundigan A Piagapo:\nThe Municipality of Piagapo is a Muslim area that is predominantly populated by Maranao tribe who are culturally bounded people. Its people, majority of which, do not accept birth control, birth spacing and other methods. They believe it is against their religious belief. However, majority of them learned to accept other health intervention particularly to maintain and improve health status. This belief and value of the people of Piagapo had caused an increase in its population from time to time. This is revealed by the different census conducted by NSO in different year. The latest and current population of the municipality as distributed to its 37 barangays is 21,974 as shown in the table below. The average household size is 3.78 or 4 persons per household. But based on 2007 census of population, Piagapo has 5,417 household and the average household size is 6.42.\n\nThe population of Piagapo varies according to the different population census conducted by the NSO, at an increasing trend. In 1995, its total population was 19,198. It increased by about 4,705 or 24.50% in a span of five years. Hence, the annual growth rate between the 1995 and 2000 was 4.5%. In 2007, another census was conducted by the NSO. That census that revealed that Piagapo’s population was increased to 34,792. Between 2000 and 2007, the population increased by 10,889 or 45.5% for a span of 7 years. Hence, the population growth rates is 6.5% annually, which is very high. However, it was somehow unbelievable and unrealistic, that between 2007 and 2010, The population of Piagapo tremendously declined from 34,792 to 21,974 in just a span of 3 years. The decrease was unusual and very abrupt. The constituents of Piagapo could not believe it, even when some of the residents migrated to other areas in the Philippines temporarily after occurrence of the all-out war against the MILF in the previous years.\n\nPeople of Piagapo are mostly farmers by occupation who generally produce corn, rice as major agricultural products. However, there are few of them who also plant other agricultural products such as trees like mahogany, acacia, and various fruit trees. Vegetables, species and root crops particularly cassava, camote and the like are among the secondary products in the municipality. Due to problem on farm to market road, farmers usually produce mostly for home consumption.\n\nAside from producing agricultural products as the main source of income, some of the residents in the municipality raised carabaos, and cows as working animals. Poultry products such as chicken, duck, and goose are also raised but in limited number and for household consumption only. Raising poultry products is a way of subsidizing the basic needs of the people. Raising livestock like chicken is becoming very discouraging due to lack of knowledge on controlling disease of this livestock. Livestock like carabao and cows are in some cases raised in the community by some well off families, farmers and landlord in limited quantity and mainly as work animal or some times for rent.\n\nFarm-to-Market road has been a problem almost all over the municipality. Poor road coupled with the absence of Municipal Local Public Market, make it more difficult for the farmers to market their products. The agricultural products are usually marketed either to Saguiaran, Baloi, Lanao del Norte, Pantaoaragat and Iligan City. The decision of the farmers where to market their products is usually dependent on the price offered by the different buyers/middlemen available in the above-mentioned market areas. However, more frequently the price offered is unreasonable. In addition thereto, the expensive transportation cost of products makes farming a losing, discouraging and undesirable low profile venture to the people. Hence, the municipality, in cooperation with other agencies, should give careful attention to these issues and should provide, improve and rehabilitate farm to market road and educate farmers on adoptable agricultural technology and provide a centralized Public Market in a strategic area in the locality where the products of the farmers can be marketed at reasonable fair price and less transportation cost.\n\nThe municipal hall of Piagapo is situated at Barangay Bobo, the first barangay to be reached from Saguiaran, Lanao del Sur, with an area of 11,270 square meter.\n\nElected officials 2016-2019:\n\nThe accessibility and the availability of farm to market roads had been for many years the widely known problems of the people of Piagapo especially those residents from the far flung and interior areas of the municipality which usually use horses as the primary mode of transportation. Though some barangays can somehow be reached through land transportation via Saguiaran, through the long winding provincial road that transverse the municipality, and through barangay road extending from Barangay Kabingan, MSU, Marawi City to Barangay Bobo, Piagapo, most areas are still inaccessible. Not all kinds of vehicle can access the area due to the condition of the provincial road and several barangay roads. The provincial road is segmented road. Some parts are cemented while several portions are still earth fill and impassable or inaccessible like TAPORUG, TALAO, KALUNGUNAN, BAGOA INGUD, LININDING, GACAP, BANGCO, and PALACAT especially during rainy season. They usually use horses as the primary mode of transportation.\n\nAvailability of electric power has been one of the major problems in Piagapo for a very long period of time. While 20 or 50% of the 37 barangays were provided with electricity by LASURECO, it is undeniable that the supply or availability of electricity in the locality is not regular. In fact, 17 barangays (46%) have been dwelling in darkness for a long period of time and had been longing and very eager to avail to such basic service while the rest are asking for its sustainability. Just recently, last August 2013, the municipality is totally in darkness, no electricity in the whole area of Piagapo. The irregularity of electric power in the municipality does not only hamper the development of the area but also slow down and seriously affect the performance and delivery of some services of the LGU. Moreover, the connection or installation of electric wiring has to be improved to avoid accidents and unwanted events relative to electricity.\n\nThe Department of Education (DepEd) has been exerting effort and great investment to address the needs for quality education and make it available on a vastly wider scale to develop those potentials. Presently, DepEd has the following number schools of different levels addressing the needs for quality education. The municipality of Piagapo is among the depressed areas that are confronted with problems on illiteracy. Illiteracy problem has been obvious in the area which is one among the major factors that hampers development.\n\n"}

Some people of Saguiaran particularly those from the Barangays along the national highway such as Barangay Batangan, Poblacion and Mipaga, trace their roots from the Royal Sultanate of Marawi or the Buadi Sacayo.\n\nSaguiaran is considered the gateway to Lanao del Sur when one is coming from Northern Mindanao. It is home to NPC Agus II Hydro Power Plant. It host the widely known MSU-Saguiaran Community High School where the first Maranao Summa Cum Laude graduate of the Mindanao State University completed his secondary education. Saguiaran is relatively peaceful as compared to nearby towns within Lanao. One would know if he is entering town of Saguiaran once he is crossing the Pantar Bridge, an American–built steel–truss bridge more than five decades ago and this is now being renovated, and seeing the Provincial Welcome Arch with visible Islamic influence. This indicates that one is entering a Muslim majority province and only about 7 kilometers away from the lone Islamic City in the country. One needs to traverse the town of Saguiaran to reach the only city in Lanao del Sur, Marawi City. Originally, selective people of Saguiaran trace their lineage to Buadi Sacayo from Marawi City and his descendants are the only allowed to wear the throne as Sultan of Marawi along with Buadi Sacayo from Marawi. Thus people of Saguiaran and Marawi are inter-related.\n\nSaguiaran boasts its town of having one of the best Municipal offices in the province. Also, it is where the Pantaw Raya is located which is considered a National treasure. Traversing Saguiaran would mean that one has to pass by the Barangays of Pawak, Batangan, Limogao, Poblacion and Bubong. This has a total distance of nearly 5 kilometers with good paved national roads. Mosque's minarets are too visible along the highway. This shows how devoted the people to their religion, Islam.\n\nThe main form of livelihood here is agriculture however the town is widely known as the home to the best Browa, a Maranao sweets, in Lanao. One must stop by at the Tata's Store across the Municipal Hall along the highway to have a taste of this delicacy. This along with most popular Palapa, a Maranao spicy appetizer, are best for 'Balikbayan pasalubong'.\n\nOne can reach Saguiaran either via road transport from Iligan City via jeepney or public utility vehicle going to Marawi City.\n\nPantuwaraya Lake National Park is a park comprising Lake Pantao Raya and surrounding area. It was declared a national park in 1965.\n\nTourists can visit the Basak Lake located at Barangay Maito Basak. Another tourists attraction here is the Buwalan Mosque, considered the oldest Mosque in Saguiaran, is situated above tiny hills where in nearby spring provides potable water to people of Saguiaran and nearby Marawi City. This spring has many outlets but the notable one is the one being used by the public as water supply.\n\nTourists may buy special Browa, a Maranao delicacy, at Tata Bakeshoppe along the National Highway fronting the Municipal Hall. The taste has made this Browa special than other Browa made from Marawi City. The provincial welcome arch is located at Saguiaran, which is notable for its Islamic influence.\n\nPantar Bridge is a half-century-old American-built truss bridge. Currently, the bridge is under renovation. Overseen from the bridge is the water reservoir of National Power Corporation and the welcome arch of the province of Lanao del Sur.\n\nThere are a few of the public and private schools in Saguiaran:\n\n"}

Many important anatomists began their careers as prosectors working for lecturers and demonstrators in anatomy and pathology.\n\nThe act of prosecting differs from that of dissecting. A prosection is a professionally prepared dissection prepared by a prosector – a person who is well versed in anatomy and who therefore prepares a specimen so that others may study and learn anatomy from it. A dissection is prepared by a student who is dissecting the specimen for the purpose of learning more about the anatomical structures pertaining to that specimen. The term dissection may also be used to describe the act of cutting. Therefore, a prosector dissects to prepare a prosection.\n\nProsecting is intricate work where numerous tools are used to produce a desired specimen. Scalpels and scissors allow for sharp dissection where tissue is cut, e.g. the biceps brachii muscle can be removed from the specimen by cutting the origin and insertion with a scalpel. Probes and the prosector's own fingers are examples of tools used for blunt dissection where tissue may be separated from surrounding structures without cutting, i.e. the bellies of biceps brachii and coracobrachialis muscle were made clearer by loosening the fascia between the two muscles with a blunt probe.\n\nGenerally, the risks to prosectors are low. Cadavers used for teaching purposes are embalmed before they are encountered by a prosector and students. Embalming fluid usually contains formaldehyde, phenol, Dettol, and glycerine which disinfect and kill pathogens within the cadaver. With exposure to embalming fluid, tissues and bodily fluids, such as blood, become fixed. Prosectors and students working with embalmed cadavers must always wear protective gloves, however this is more for protection against the harsh chemicals used in embalming such as formaldehyde and dettol which can cause moderate to severe skin irritation.\n\nFurther to the protection that embalming allows against disease, educational institutions take great care in screening the cadavers accepted into their body donation programs. Cadavers are not accepted if they have a medical history of infectious disease such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.\n\nProsectors for autopsies of diseased cadavers may run a high risk of suffering from health problems when caution is not used as cadavers are not fixed when being dissected for autopsy. At least two diseases are named after prosectors:\n\n\nContracting infections caused by contaminated cadavers is a constant danger among prosectors, particularly if a skin puncture accident results from the sharp surgical instruments used in this kind of work (about 70% of pathology workers report having at least one percutaneous incident). In this case, thin surgical gloves are not enough to protect. There are many cases of pathologists who died of acute sepsis (blood poisoning) because of this. Another example, a famous historical case, is that of Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow, an Austrian physician, pathologist and physiologist, who infected his finger during an autopsy and became dependent on morphine, due to the pain; and, later, on cocaine, at the instigation of his friend, Sigmund Freud.\n\nPresently, AIDS presents a problem. Although it is difficult to contract it by a single puncture incident (the overall personal risk has been estimated to be 0.11%), at least one case has been reported among pathologists.\n\nThe continuous respiratory exposure to formaldehyde, used to preserve cadavers, is also an occupational risk of prosectors as well as medical students, anatomists and pathologists. Inhaled formaldehyde can irritate the eyes and mucous membranes, resulting in watery eyes, headache, a burning sensation in the throat, and difficulty breathing.

It is the successor to the student-run California Aggie Marching Band-uh!, which existed from the 1920's to 2019. In 2018, the Band-uh had roughly 250 members. It performed at home and away games to cheer on the UC Davis Aggies sports teams, marched in parades, and played at events on the UC Davis campus as well as in the surrounding Davis community. \n\nUC Davis administrators ordered the permanent dissolution of the Band-uh in the fall of 2019, after accusations of repeated misconduct and an investigation by an outside law firm. At the same time, the university announced formation of a new, university administered organization with the name \"UC Davis Marching Band.\" \n\nThe original UC Davis marching band dates back to 1922, when E. H. Barger of the school's veterinary science department formed an 18-member group. That band disbanded after interest waned. \n\nThe next incarnation of the band was formed in 1929 by J. Price Gittinger as a pep band for the home football games. There were 15 original members, all male. The first female members joined within two years. In the 1960s, the student body voted to exclude women from the Band-uh! after no women showed up for a game, although also allegedly to give the band a rowdier, more masculine spirit. During the women's rights movement in the early 1970s, pressure mounted to reopen the band to women, in part to comply with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By 1973, the Band-uh! once again had female members.\n\nThe Band-uh! has been occasionally associated with controversial and obscene antics. It was reprimanded several times in the 1970s. In 1992 the band was put on probation after a sexual harassment charge was made against the student director. In 2008, the staff director of the band, who is not a student, filed a sexual harassment complaint to the university after several incidents involving the removal of shirts, offensive language and gestures, and lewd behavior. In October, 2008, he left temporarily on a \"leave of absence because of all the band stress.\" On April 4, 2019, The California Aggie newspaper published an article citing former Band-uh! members' experiences with hazing, sexual assault, and other forms of misconduct.\n\nThe Band-uh! has released two albums of its music, \"Barn Party\" in 1998 and \"Noise Violation\" in 2002. The band's catalog was composed of its traditional marching songs, such as the \"Aggie Fight\" song, as well as renditions of popular rock songs such as Green Day's \"Welcome to Paradise\", Edgar Winter's \"Frankenstein\", and Jefferson Airplane's \"White Rabbit\", among many others.\n\nAround April 2019, multiple accusations of hazing, sexual assault, and general misconduct instigated by current members of the now-dissolved Band-uh! and some of its alumni led to an investigation into the band's traditions and their true nature. Five months later, in September 2019, the UC Davis administration issued a public statement officially declaring that the student-run Band-uh! would \"no longer exist\" and would restructure the marching band completely, with strict oversight, a faculty director, and an entirely new constitution. \n\nThe newly-formed 'UC Davis Marching Band' made their public performance debut on September 28, 2019 at a home football game against Montana.\n\nThe Band-uh had an officer council which consisted of 12 student officers, such as the Drum Major, Student Director, and Manager (the Big Three), among others all being equal for voting rights in council meetings. Officers were elected by their peers every year, and served 1 or 2 year terms with the second year requiring a second election. The officer council worked in conjunction with the Faculty director to manage the band. Each section in the band also had 2 section leaders, who managed their sections and were a point of contact between the officer council and the general members. \n\nParticipation in the Band-uh was open to any student of UC Davis as well as UCD Staff and community members upon approval of the officer council. There was no audition in order to join, and musicians of all experience levels were accepted. The band was an entirely volunteer organization, and members were not compensated by units or scholarship money of any kind.\n\nFor football games and parades, the Band-uh wore their formal, blue and gold, \"full dress\" marching uniforms. For other sports games and most other gigs, members wore their more casual white collared shirt, blue jeans, and button-laden floppy hat outfits, known as the Mav'rik Band uniform. In 2009, the band received new, custom-made full dress uniforms to replace the ones provided for by Warren Mooney in the late 1970s.\n\nThere were 10 instrument sections within the CAMB: Flutes (flutes and piccolos), Nets (clarinets), Altos (alto saxophones), Tenors (tenor saxophones), Baritax (baritone saxophones and baritone horns), Trumpets, Mellos (mellophones), Bones (trombones), Sousies (sousaphones), and Drums (snare drums, bass drums, cymbals, and glockenspiels).\n\nThe announcement used to present the Band-uh! at every Aggie home game was usually as follows, with occasional minor variations:\n\n\"Fast, furious, and foaming at the mouth,\"<br>\n\"Bold, blue, and bitchin',\"<br>\n\"It's the pride of the Regents of the University of California,\"<br>\n\"The spirit of the Davis Campus,\"<br>\n\"The California Aggie Marching Band-uh!\"<br>\n\n"}
{"id": "2070564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070564", "title": "Java Card", "text": "Java Card\n\nJava Card refers to a software technology that allows Java-based applications (applets) to be run securely on smart cards and similar small memory footprint devices. Java Card is the tiniest of Java platforms targeted for embedded devices. Java Card gives the user the ability to program the devices and make them application specific. It is widely used in SIM cards (used in GSM mobile phones) and ATM cards. The first Java Card was introduced in 1996 by Schlumberger's card division which later merged with Gemplus to form Gemalto. Java Card products are based on the Java Card Platform specifications developed by Sun Microsystems (later a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation). Many Java card products also rely on the GlobalPlatform specifications for the secure management of applications on the card (download, installation, personalization, deletion).\n\nThe main design goals of the Java Card technology are portability and security.\n\nJava Card aims at defining a standard smart card computing environment allowing the same Java Card applet to run on different smart cards, much like a Java applet runs on different computers. As in Java, this is accomplished using the combination of a virtual machine (the Java Card Virtual Machine), and a well-defined runtime library, which largely abstracts the applet from differences between smart cards. Portability remains mitigated by issues of memory size, performance, and runtime support (e.g. for communication protocols or cryptographic algorithms).\n\nJava Card technology was originally developed for the purpose of securing sensitive information stored on smart cards. Security is determined by various aspects of this technology:\n\nAt the language level, Java Card is a precise subset of Java: all language constructs of Java Card exist in Java and behave identically. This goes to the point that as part of a standard build cycle, a Java Card program is compiled into a Java class file by a Java compiler; the class file is post-processed by tools specific to the Java Card platform.\n\nHowever, many Java language features are not supported by Java Card (in particular types char, double, float and long; the codice_1 qualifier; enums; arrays of more than one dimension; finalization; object cloning; threads). Further, some common features of Java are not provided at runtime by many actual smart cards (in particular type codice_2, which is the default type of a Java expression; and garbage collection of objects).\n\nJava Card bytecode run by the Java Card Virtual Machine is a functional subset of Java 2 bytecode run by a standard Java Virtual Machine but with a different encoding to optimize for size. A Java Card applet thus typically uses less bytecode than the hypothetical Java applet obtained by compiling the same Java source code. This conserves memory, a necessity in resource constrained devices like smart cards. As a design tradeoff, there is no support for some Java language features (as mentioned above), and size limitations. Techniques exist for overcoming the size limitations, such as dividing the application's code into packages below the 64 KiB limit.\n\nStandard Java Card class library and runtime support differs a lot from that in Java, and the common subset is minimal. For example, the Java Security Manager class is not supported in Java Card, where security policies are implemented by the Java Card Virtual Machine; and transients (non-persistent, fast RAM variables that can be class members) are supported via a Java Card class library, while they have native language support in Java.\n\nThe Java Card runtime and virtual machine also support features that are specific to the Java Card platform:\n\nCoding techniques used in a practical Java Card program differ significantly from those used in a Java program. Still, that Java Card uses a precise subset of the Java language speeds up the learning curve, and enables using a Java environment to develop and debug a Java Card program (caveat: even if debugging occurs with Java bytecode, make sure that the class file fits the limitation of Java Card language by converting it to Java Card bytecode; and test in a real Java Card smart card early on to get an idea of the performance); further, one can run and debug both the Java Card code for the application to be embedded in a smart card, and a Java application that will be in the host using the smart card, all working jointly in the same environment.\n\nOracle has released several Java Card platform specifications and is providing SDK tools for application development.\nUsually smart card vendors implement just a subset of algorithms specified in Java Card platform target\nand the only way to discover what subset of specification is implemented is to test the card.\n\n\nThe version 3.0 of the Java Card specification (draft released in March 2008) is separated in two editions: the \"Classic Edition\" and the \"Connected Edition\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2070566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070566", "title": "Dimethyl sulfate", "text": "Dimethyl sulfate\n\nDimethyl sulfate is a chemical compound with formula (CHO)SO. As the diester of methanol and sulfuric acid, its formula is often written as (CH)SO or even MeSO, where CH or Me is methyl. MeSO is mainly used as a methylating agent in organic synthesis.\n\nMeSO is a colourless oily liquid with a slight onion-like odour (although smelling it would represent significant exposure). Like all strong alkylating agents, MeSO is extremely toxic. Its use as a laboratory reagent has been superseded to some extent by methyl triflate, CFSOCH, the methyl ester of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.\n\nDimethyl sulfate was discovered in the early 19th century in an impure form. P. Claesson later extensively studied its preparation.\nIt was used in chemical warfare in WWI.\n\nDimethyl sulfate can be synthesized in the laboratory by many different methods, the simplest being the esterification of sulfuric acid with methanol:\nAnother possible synthesis involves distillation of methyl hydrogen sulfate:\nMethyl nitrite and methyl chlorosulfonate also result in dimethyl sulfate:\n\nMeSO has been produced commercially since the 1920s. A common process is the continuous reaction of dimethyl ether with sulfur trioxide.\n\nDimethyl sulfate is best known as a reagent for the methylation of phenols, amines, and thiols. One methyl group is transferred more quickly than the second. Methyl transfer is assumed to occur via an S2 reaction. Compared to other methylating agents, dimethyl sulfate is preferred by the industry because of its low cost and high reactivity.\n\nMost commonly MeSO is employed to methylate phenols. Some simple alcohols are also suitably methylated, as illustrated by the conversion of \"tert\"-butanol to t-butyl methyl ether:\nAlkoxide salts are rapidly methylated:\n\nThe methylation of sugars is called Haworth methylation.\n\nMeSO is used to prepare both quaternary ammonium salts or tertiary amines:\nQuaternized fatty ammonium compounds are used as a surfactant or fabric softeners. Methylation to create a tertiary amine is illustrated as:\n\nSimilar to the methylation of alcohols, mercaptide salts are easily methylated by MeSO:\nAn example is:\nThis method has been used to prepare thioesters:\n\nDimethyl sulfate (DMS) is used to determine the secondary structure of RNA. At neutral pH, DMS methylates unpaired adenine and cytosine residues at their canonical Watson-Crick faces, but it cannot methylate base-paired nucleotides. Using the method known as DMS-MaPseq, RNA is incubated with DMS to methylate unpaired bases. Then the RNA is reverse-transcribed; the reverse transcriptase frequently adds an incorrect DNA base when it encounters a methylated RNA base. These mutations can be detected via sequencing, and the RNA is inferred to be single-stranded at bases with above-background mutation rates.\n\nDimethyl sulfate can effect the base-specific cleavage of DNA by attacking the imidazole rings present in guanine. Dimethyl sulfate also methylates adenine in single-stranded portions of DNA (e.g., those with proteins like RNA polymerase progressively melting and re-annealing the DNA). Upon re-annealing, these methyl groups interfere with adenine-guanine base-pairing. Nuclease S1 can then be used to cut the DNA in single-stranded regions (anywhere with a methylated adenine). This is an important technique for analyzing protein-DNA interactions.\n\nAlthough dimethyl sulfate is highly effective and affordable, its toxicity has encouraged the use of other methylating reagents. Methyl iodide is a reagent used for O-methylation, like dimethyl sulfate, but is less hazardous and more expensive. Dimethyl carbonate, which is less reactive, has far lower toxicity compared to both dimethyl sulfate and methyl iodide. High pressure can be used to accelerate methylation by dimethyl carbonate. In general, the toxicity of methylating agents is correlated with their efficiency as methyl transfer reagents.\n\nDimethyl sulfate is carcinogenic and mutagenic, highly poisonous, corrosive, and environmentally hazardous. Dimethyl sulfate is absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract, and can cause a fatal delayed respiratory tract reaction. An ocular reaction is also common. There is no strong odor or immediate irritation to warn of lethal concentration in the air. The LD50 (acute, oral) is 205 mg/kg (rat) and 140 mg/kg (mouse), and LC50 (acute) is 45 ppm / 4 hours (rat). The vapor pressure of 65 Pa is sufficiently large to produce a lethal concentration in air by evaporation at 20 °C. Delayed toxicity allows potentially fatal exposures to occur prior to development of any warning symptoms. Symptoms may be delayed 6–24 hours. Concentrated solutions of bases (ammonia, alkalis) can be used to hydrolyze minor spills and residues on contaminated equipment, but the reaction may become violent with larger amounts of dimethyl sulfate (see ICSC). Although the compound hydrolyses, treatment with water cannot be assumed to decontaminate dimethyl sulfate.\n\n"}

She was known for her husky voice and no-nonsense attitude. Two of her most famous roles were as Mrs. Day on \"The Jack Benny Program\" (1939–1962) and as Hilda Crocker on the CBS sitcom \"December Bride\" (1952–1959).\n\nFelton was born in Salinas, California, on July 20, 1890. Her father, a doctor, died shortly before her 9th birthday. When going over his accounts after his death, Felton's mother discovered that although her husband had a large medical practice in San Jose, there were no records of his patients' payments for treatment and no cash in the office. Shortly before her father's death, Felton had performed in a local benefit for victims of the Galveston Flood. Her singing and dancing attracted the attention of a manager of a road show company that was playing in San Jose at the time. The manager spoke to Felton's mother, offering to give Felton a job with his company. Since the family was experiencing difficult financial times with the loss of Felton's father, her mother contacted the road show manager. Felton quickly joined the cast of the show, growing up in the theater.\n\nAn August 19, 1900, newspaper advertisement for Fischer's Concert House in San Francisco listed among the performers \"Little Verna Felton, the Child Wonder.\" By 1903, she was acting with the Allen Stock Company, which that year toured the west coast of the United States and performed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. By 1907, she was still with the Allen troupe, but she had progressed from child performer to leading lady. Herbert Bashford wrote a play, \"The Defiance of Doris\", specifically for Felton, and the Allen company included it among the group's productions in 1910.\n\nShe acted in stage plays at the Empress Theatre in Vancouver in the late 1920s, playing the lead role in \"Goldfish\", \"Stella Dallas\", and \"The Second Mrs. Tanqueray\". Future husband Lee Millar directed the band for these plays.\n\nFelton worked extensively in the 1930s and '50s in Hollywood radio, notably playing The Mom in \"The Cinnamon Bear\", Junior the Mean Widdle Kid's grandmother on Red Skelton's radio series, Hattie Hirsch on \"Point Sublime\", and Dennis Day's protective, domineering, and authoritative mother, Mrs Day, who was always looking out for him while trying to boss around Jack Benny on \"The Jack Benny Program\". In addition, she performed on radio as a regular on \"The Abbott and Costello Show\" and \"The Great Gildersleeve\".\n\nFelton appeared in a recurring role as the mother of Ruth Farley, a young woman played by Gloria Winters in the 1953–55 ABC sitcom with a variety show theme, \"Where's Raymond?\", renamed \"The Ray Bolger Show\". The series starred Ray Bolger as Raymond Wallace, a song-and-dance man who was repeatedly barely on time for his performances.\n\nThough some sitcom aficionados might assume that her guest appearances on \"I Love Lucy\" led to a regular supporting role as Hilda Crocker on the CBS sitcom \"December Bride\", Felton had played that same character on the radio version two years prior to the television production. \"December Bride\" also starred Spring Byington, Dean Miller, Frances Rafferty, and Harry Morgan. Felton continued her Hilda Crocker role on the \"December Bride\" spin-off, \"Pete and Gladys\", with Harry Morgan and Cara Williams. For her performance on \"December Bride\", Felton was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 1958 and in 1959.\n\nFelton was the original voice of Wilma Flintstone's mother, Pearl Slaghoople, voicing the character as a semi-regular on Hanna-Barbera's \"The Flintstones\" from 1962–63. In 1963, in the series finale of CBS's \"Dennis the Menace\" sitcom, Felton played John Wilson's aunt in the episode entitled \"Aunt Emma Visits the Wilsons\". In the story line, Mr. Wilson (Gale Gordon) tries to convince Aunt Emma to leave her estate to him and his wife, Eloise (Sara Seegar). Wilson becomes suspicious when Emma begins spending time with Dennis Mitchell (Jay North).\n\nDuring the 1940s and the early 1950s, she was in demand as a character actress on films, with roles in \"If I Had My Way\" (1940), \"Girls of the Big House\" (1945), \"The Fuller Brush Man\" (1948),\" Buccaneer's Girl\" (1950), \"Belles on Their Toes\" (1952), \"Don't Bother to Knock\" (1952), and her memorable role as Mrs. Potts warmly acting as surrogate mother to William Holden in the film adaptation of William Inge's stage play \"Picnic\" (1955).\n\nFelton was a popular actress at the Walt Disney Studios and MGM Studios, lending her voice to several animated features, including:\n\nFelton was married to radio actor Lee Millar (1888–1941), who also did animation voices (notably for Disney's Pluto). Their son, Lee Carson Millar Jr. (1924–1980), appeared as an actor on a variety of television series between 1952 and 1967, including, coincidentally, in two episodes of Dennis the Menace as Tommy Anderson's father, but not on the same episode as his mother.\n\nFelton died at the age of 76 from a stroke on the evening of December 14, 1966, the day before Walt Disney died. She is interred at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\n\n"}

It was a heavy wagon given protective sides with firing slits and heavy firepower from either a cannon or a force of hand-gunners, archers and crossbowmen, supported by infantry using spears, pikes and flails. Groups of them could form defensive works, but they also were used as hardpoints for formations or as firepower in pincer movements. This early use of gunpowder and innovative tactics helped a largely peasant infantry stave off attacks by the Holy Roman Empire's larger forces of mounted knights.\n\nAfter the Hussite wars, they stayed in usage as the special tactical weapon of Bohemian mercenaries which prevailed against knights or foot soldiers. Its successful history came to an end, at least for large scale engagements, with the development of field-piece artillery: a battle wagon wall \"fortress\" of approximately 300 wagons was broken at the Battle of Wenzenbach September 12, 1504 by the culverines (early cannons) and muskets of the landsknecht regiment of G. Frundsberg.\n\nA separate development were the use of war wagons in China. One of the earliest example of using conjoined wagons in warfare as fortification is described in the Chinese historical record \"Book of Han\". During the 119 BC Battle of Mobei of the Han–Xiongnu War, the famous Han general Wei Qing led his army through a fatiguing expeditionary march across the Gobi desert only to find Yizhixie chanyu's main force waiting to encircle them on the other side. Using armored heavy wagons known as \"Wu Gang Wagon\" () in ring formations as temporary defensive fortifications, Wei Qing neutralised the Xiongnu's initial cavalry charges, forcing a stalemate and buying time for his troops to recover strength, before using the cover of a sandstorm to launch a counteroffensive which overran the nomads.\n\nThe Guangwu Emperor (AD 25-57) introduced a ox-pulled war wagon several stories high with an observation tower, which was deployed at the Great Wall against the Xiongnu. By the 6th century such war wagons reached several meters in height and had up to 20 wheels.\n\n"}

He is, as of 2019, the highest ranking judicial official from Mississippi since Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II served on the United States Supreme Court in 1893.\n\nClark was born in Memphis, Tennessee to Charles and Anita Clark and was the great-grandson of Mississippi Governor Charles Clark (1863–1865). After being graduated from Cleveland High School (Cleveland, Mississippi), he entered the United States Naval Reserve as an ensign in 1943 and left the Reserve after the end of World War II three years later. He attended law school at the University of Mississippi, where he was a member of Delta Psi fraternity and met his future wife, Emily. He began the practice of law in 1946 in Jackson, Mississippi and continued in private practice for five years, earning a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1948, then rejoined the Naval Reserve as a lieutenant as the Korean War heated up in 1951. He left the Naval Reserve the following year, and resumed his law practice in 1953.\n\nOn October 7, 1969, President Richard Nixon nominated Clark to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated by Judge Claude Feemster Clayton. He was confirmed by the United States Senate only eight days later on October 15, 1969 and received his commission two days later. In 1973 and again in 1976, he was recommended to fill vacancies on the United States Supreme Court and each time, he received the American Bar Association's highest qualification. Clark was Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit from 1981 until his retirement from the court on January 15, 1992. He resided in Jackson, Mississippi with his wife Emily until his death on March 6, 2011. In addition to producing more than 2200 opinions, and presiding over the Fifth Circuit for more than ten years, Judge Clark was appointed by Chief Justice Warren Burger and again by Chief Justice William Rehnquist to the Judicial Conference of the United States, the principal policymaking body for the federal courts. During his eleven years there, he served as chairman of the Budget Committee and then chairman of the Executive Committee.\n\nClark was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws from Mississippi College and was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the Law School of Ole Miss in the spring of 2009.\n\n"}
{"id": "2070660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070660", "title": "AD (band)", "text": "AD (band)\n\nAD was a 1980s Christian rock band, featuring former Kansas members Kerry Livgren (guitar, keyboard, synthesizers, backing vocals) and Dave Hope (bass), former Bloodrock member Warren Ham (lead vocals, saxophone, flute, harmonica), who had toured as a sideman with Kansas in 1982, Michael Gleason (lead vocals, keyboards, guitar), who had replaced Ham as a touring member of Kansas in 1983, and Dennis Holt (drums).\n\nThroughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, Kerry Livgren had been guitarist, keyboardist, and principal composer for the successful American rock band, Kansas. During his tenure with the group, he had explored numerous eastern religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism. These themes often appeared in the lyrics to songs on early Kansas records such as \"Kansas\", \"Song for America\", and \"Masque\".\n\nLivgren became a born-again Christian in 1979, followed by Kansas bassist Dave Hope in 1980. The change of lyrical direction in \"Audio-Visions\" due to Livgren's conversion began to create a rift between the members of Kansas. The strong focus that Livgren placed on his Christian faith in lyrics of songs to be recorded for \"Vinyl Confessions\", especially in \"Crossfire\", turned out to be the last straw for Kansas's original lead vocalist Steve Walsh, who left Kansas to form the band Streets in 1981.\n\nThe remaining Kansas members held numerous auditions to select a new lead vocalist that could effectively replace Steve Walsh's songwriting and singing skills. Eventually, John Elefante was hired as Walsh's replacement, but hopefuls Warren Ham and Michael Gleason left an impression on Kerry Livgren, who was in the process of writing material for a second solo album for CBS Records. Instead of using different musicians for each song as he had done on his 1980 solo album \"Seeds of Change\", he would put together a single group consisting of himself, Dave Hope, Warren Ham, Michael Gleason and Dennis Holt.\n\nDuring Kansas's time with John Elefante as lead vocalist and keyboardist, Livgren became increasingly uncomfortable with Kansas representing his Christian worldview. After a final New Year's Eve performance on December 31, 1983, Livgren and Hope left the band.\n\nIn 1983, after Livgren's departure from Kansas, he finished recording his second self-produced album for CBS, \"Time Line\", with himself on guitar and keyboard, Hope on bass, Ham on saxophone, flute, harmonica and vocals, Gleason on vocals, keyboards and guitar and Holt on drums. During sessions for the album, it became apparent that the musicians shared many interests, not the least of which was their Christian faith. After years of feeling isolated and artistically stifled in Kansas, Livgren found working with fellow Christians refreshing. By the end of the recording sessions, the session musicians had jelled, and Livgren decided to name the group AD. \"Time Line\" was released in 1984 and credited to Kerry Livgren/AD. It received virtually no promotion from CBS Records, who probably saw the side project as a threat to the continued success of Kansas. Due to legal entanglements caused by his contractual obligations with Kansas, Livgren was unable to market AD in the mainstream secular market. After negotiating with the record label, he received a waiver to perform with AD in the Christian rock market. This would become a hindrance to commercial viability for the band.\n\nAD toured extensively between 1983 and 1985, sometimes playing bars and clubs one night and then churches the next. Livgren has stated on several occasions that he experienced some of the highest and lowest points in his career during his time with AD. Livgren mentions in his book \"Seeds of Change: The Spiritual Quest of Kerry Livgren\" that his time playing live with AD was his best as a guitarist.\n\n\"Art of the State\" was released in 1985 on Livgren's own Christian label, Kerygma Records, distributed by Sparrow Records, and was the first album credited to the band name AD. The group began touring, but were quickly discouraged by a lack of professionalism in the Christian venues. After the tour, Ham left the band, and the remaining four members decided to produce one more album before ending AD. Gleason was left to handle the lead vocals alone on the next album, appropriately titled \"Reconstructions\". Due to financial difficulties, AD faded away in 1986 after its release, even though no official breakup was announced. In an interview, Livgren said that AD played its last gig in Detroit on December 31, 1985 but never received any more requests for shows after that, so the members just drifted off into other projects.\n\nAlthough AD had been unofficially disbanded for two years, Livgren and Ham put together one more album to pay off band bills, with the band name reverting to Kerry Livgren/AD. Released in 1988, \"Prime Mover\" was a collection of previously unreleased AD songs. Livgren played all instruments, and all vocals were performed by Ham.\n\nIn 1992, Livgren released a double-CD retrospective titled \"Decade\", celebrating 10 years since his first solo recording. It included Livgren's first two solo albums \"Seeds of Change\" and \"Time Line\" in their entirety, plus tracks from other albums, including \"Art of the State\", \"Prime Mover\" and \"One of Several Possible Musiks\", and previously unreleased songs.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Livgren re-released \"Art of the State\" on his new independent record label, Numavox Records. A partially re-recorded version of \"Reconstructions\" was also released in 1997.\n\nIn 1997, Livgren discovered recordings of two AD performances from 1984 and 1985 that had been made by the soundboard engineer during the \"Art of the State\" tour. Though the recordings had not been made for release, Livgren remastered them and released them as a \"thank you\" to fans on a CD-R title called \"AD Live\". The performances include mistakes and technical problems left intact and is meant as an archival release.\n\nIn 1998, Livgren mostly re-recorded \"Prime Mover\" and added five new songs and a new version of \"Fair Exchange\" from the Kansas album \"Vinyl Confessions\" in the reissue, \"Prime Mover II\".\n\nShortly after the release of the Kansas album \"Somewhere to Elsewhere\" in 2000, Livgren began work on the album \"The Best of Kerry Livgren\". Both retrospective and forward-looking, it contains tracks from all his solo releases and some AD tracks. The album also includes two new songs and new recordings of four older songs. Each of these new versions features the original vocalists, including Ham, Gleason, and Ronnie James Dio.\n\nIn 2008, Livgren reworked and reissued \"Prime Mover\" again as \"Prime Mover (Redux)\".\n\nA revised and expanded edition of Livgren's 1985 autobiography, \"Seeds of Change: The Spiritual Quest of Kerry Livgren\", co-written with Kenneth Boa, was released in 1991 that updated the book to cover his time with AD.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2070671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070671", "title": "Battle of Modder River", "text": "Battle of Modder River\n\nThe Battle of Modder River (known in Afrikaans as \"Slag van die Twee Riviere\", which translates as \"Battle of the two rivers\") was an engagement in the Boer War, fought at Muddy River, on 28 November 1899. A British column under Lord Methuen, that was attempting to relieve the besieged town of Kimberley, forced Boers under General Piet Cronjé to retreat to Magersfontein, but suffered heavy casualties themselves.\n\nWhen the war broke out, one of the Boers' early targets was the diamond-mining centre of Kimberley, which stood not far from the point where the borders of the Boer republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, and the British-controlled Cape Colony met. Although their forces surrounded the town, they did not press home any immediate assault. Nor did they attempt to cross the Orange River on this front to invade Cape Colony.\n\nMeanwhile, British reinforcements were on their way to South Africa. Their commander, General Sir Redvers Buller detached the 1st Division under Lieutenant General Lord Methuen to relieve the Siege of Kimberley. This decision was made partly for reasons of prestige, as the capture of Kimberley (which contained the famous Imperialist and former Prime Minister of Cape Colony, Cecil Rhodes) would be a major propaganda victory for the British.\n\nDuring November, Methuen's force advanced north along the Western Cape Railway. They fought and won two engagements against Boers from the Orange Free State under General Prinsloo at the Battle of Belmont and at Graspan. At least one American, Lance Corporal Hollon Bush of the 7th Company, First Battalion Coldstream Guards was present and wounded at the Battle of Modder River. His journey to enlist from departure in New Orleans to England was not without many pitfalls before beginning service at the Tower of London, then on to Gibraltar and South Africa.\n\nThe Boers had been reinforced by a substantial contingent from the Transvaal under General Koos de la Rey, who proposed a radical new plan of defence. He pointed out that the Boers had previously been easily driven from the \"kopjes\" (hills) which they had occupied. The kopjes had been obvious aiming marks for the numerically superior British artillery. Also, the trajectory of rifle fire from Boers on the top of the kopjes was steeply plunging. It therefore had a chance of hitting its target only in the last six feet or so of its flight. Once British infantry had reached the foot of the kopje, they were concealed by boulders and scrub, and could then easily drive the Boers off the summit with the bayonet.\n\nDe la Rey proposed to make use of the flat trajectory of the Mauser rifle with which the Boers were armed, together with the flat veld. He called on his men to dig trenches in the banks of the Modder River, from which their rifles could sweep the veld for a great distance, and won them over. General Piet Cronje, who arrived later with the main Boer force, acquiesced in this novel plan.\n\nThe area contained two prominent hotels and the village of Rosmead, which was used as a resort by prominent businessmen from Kimberley. The Boer trenches were at on the south side of the Modder and the smaller Riet River which joined it at Modder River Station. The Boers had six field guns and one Maxim \"pom-pom\" (small rapid-firing gun) from the Orange Free State's \"Staatsartillerie\" (state artillery). They deployed these not as a concentrated battery, but as widely separated individual gun detachments north of the Modder and to the east. They had dug several emplacements for each gun, allowing their guns to switch position to avoid counter-battery fire.\n\nMethuen's force consisted of two infantry brigades (the Guards Brigade under Major-General Sir Henry Edward Colville and the 9th Brigade under Major-General Reginald Pole-Carew), two mounted regiments, three batteries of field artillery (18th, 62nd and 75th) and four guns of the Naval Brigade. Further reinforcements were arriving up the railway.\n\nThe British cavalry (the 9th Lancers and a unit recruited in Cape Town, Rimington's Guides), made some attempts to scout the ground ahead of the army, but failed entirely to detect De la Rey's trenches and other preparations. (For example, the Boers had whitewashed stones on the veld or had placed biscuit tins as range markers). At 4:30 am on 28 November, Methuen's force roused itself, deployed into line and began advancing towards the Modder, with no plans other than to cross the river before having breakfast on the far side.\n\nAs the British troops came within of the river, Methuen remarked to Colville, \"They're not here.\" Colville replied, \"They're sitting uncommonly tight if they are\". At this point the Boers opened fire. Most of the British troops were forced to throw themselves flat. Some tried to advance in short rushes, but could find no cover on the veld. Few British troops got closer than to the Boers. The Guards tried to outflank the Boer left, but were unable to ford the Riet River. The British guns pounded the buildings near Modder River Station and the line of poplar trees which marked the north bank of the Modder, and entirely missed the enemy trenches on the south bank. Meanwhile, the Boer guns maintained a galling fire, and kept in action by repeatedly moving their positions.\n\nThe battle became a day-long stalemate. Most of the British infantry lay prone on the veld, tortured by heat and thirst, but safe from enemy fire unless they moved. Many stoically smoked pipes or even slept. Methuen galloped about the field trying to renew the advance, and was himself wounded. At midday, some of Pole-Carew's 9th Brigade found the open Boer right flank at Rosmead \"drift\" (ford) downstream. British infantry infiltrated across the ford and about 1:00 pm drove the Boers out of Rosmead. The attack was disjointed, and suffered casualties when a British field artillery battery (62nd) which had just arrived on the field shelled them by mistake. By nightfall, De la Rey had driven them back into a small insecure bridgehead.\n\nNevertheless, the Boers feared that they were now vulnerable to being outflanked, and withdrew during the night.\n\nMethuen reported that the battle had been \"one of the hardest and most trying fights in the annals of the British army\". Although casualties had not been cripplingly heavy (between 450 and 480), mainly because the Boers opened fire prematurely, it was clear that any simple frontal attack by infantry only against an enemy using bolt-action rifles, was effectively impossible. The British were forced to pause for ten days, to evacuate their casualties, receive further reinforcements and repair their lines of communications. The delay allowed the Boers to construct the entrenchments which they were to defend in the Battle of Magersfontein.\n\nOn the Boer side, there were about 80 casualties, including, Adriaan, the eldest son of Koos de la Rey, mortally wounded by a shell.\n\nModder River – 28 November 1899<br>\nBritish Victory ~ Was a tiring day again with the heat and especially after forming at 4:30 am and being the 3rd battle in a week. Boers fled after British catch vital positions. Fiercest battle yet fought in the war. An almost impossible offensive task. The total Boer casualties may perhaps have amounted to 150, mainly due to shell-fire. 70 British were killed and another 413 were wounded.\n\n\n"}

The name of the trophy was the Walter A. Brown Trophy until 1984.\n\nThe current design, depicting a basketball over a hoop and basket, was first awarded in 1977 still under its original name, which was changed in honor of former NBA commissioner Larry O'Brien who served from 1975 to 1984. Before joining the NBA, O'Brien was the United States Postmaster General under President Lyndon B. Johnson from 1965 to 1968.\n\nThe trophy was originally referred to as the NBA Finals trophy, but was renamed in after Walter A. Brown, the original owner of the Boston Celtics who was instrumental in merging the BAA and the National Basketball League into the NBA in 1949.\n\nThe original trophy was awarded to the BAA/NBA champions from 1947 to 1976. The trophy was kept by the winning team for one year and given to the winning team of the following year's finals, unless the previous team won again, much like the NHL's Stanley Cup, which continues that tradition to this day.\n\nThe inaugural winners of the trophy were the Philadelphia Warriors, who defeated the Chicago Stags. From 1957 to 1969, the Celtics won the NBA Finals 11 out of 13 times, including eight consecutive wins. The final winners of the trophy were the Boston Celtics, who defeated the Phoenix Suns in the 1976 NBA Finals.\n\nA new trophy design was created for the 1977 NBA Finals, although it retained the Walter A. Brown title. The inaugural winners were the Portland Trail Blazers, who defeated Philadelphia 76ers in six games. Unlike the original championship trophy, the new trophy was given permanently to the winning team and a new one was made every year. The 1982-83 76ers were the last team to win the Brown Trophy, sweeping the Los Angeles Lakers in 1983. \n\nIn 1984, the trophy was renamed to the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy, in honor of Larry O'Brien, who served as NBA commissioner from 1975 to 1984. The Boston Celtics were the inaugural winners of the renamed trophy, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers in seven games in the 1984 NBA Finals.\n\nThe current trophy is made out of of sterling silver and vermeil with a 24 karat gold overlay and stands tall. It is designed to look like a basketball about to enter a net. The year and team names are engraved on the trophies, which are often prominently displayed in the winning team's arena.\n\nThe trophy is two feet tall and is made of 15.5 pounds of sterling silver and vermeil with a 24 karat gold overlay. The trophy is manufactured by Tiffany & Co. The championship team maintains permanent possession of the trophy (although one exception exists, as described below). The year and winning team names are engraved on the trophies, and are often prominently displayed in the winning team's arena.\n\nAfter the sale of the Houston Rockets from Leslie Alexander to Tilman Fertitta in late 2017, Alexander maintained the ownership of the team's 1993-94 and 1994-95 trophies as mementos of his ownership. Thus, the team commissioned Tiffany to create replica versions of both Larry O'Brien trophies (and replacing the 1993-94 trophy, which was unexpectedly dropped and dented by reserve center Richard Petruška during the celebration), which were publicly unveiled on September 20, 2018.\n\nAlthough the Larry O'Brien Trophy has been compared with the National Hockey League's (NHL) Stanley Cup, it has never been as prominent as the NHL trophy. To reduce this discrepancy, the NBA has been actively promoting the O'Brien Trophy in recent years to generate more recognition and an iconic status for the trophy. The trophy appeared on past logos for the NBA Finals. After the Detroit Pistons won the NBA Finals in 2004, the trophy was toured around the state of Michigan, marking the first time the trophy toured around the state of the winning team. In 2005, the NBA Legends Tour was launched in New York City. As part of the tour, the O’Brien Trophy was showcased in various cities—including those that were hosting the playoffs—for fans' autograph and photo sessions. It was escorted by many former players, including Julius Erving, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell. In May 2007, the NBA unveiled the NBA Headquarters on Second Life, an Internet-based virtual reality environment. With this launch, fans could take pictures with the championship trophy in the virtual Toyota Larry O'Brien Trophy Room. In August, the trophy traveled to Hong Kong for the first time as part of the NBA Madness Asia Tour.\nThis table lists the teams that have won the Larry O' Brien Championship Trophy since it was introduced in 1977.

Mixminion can send and receive anonymous e-mail.\n\nMixminion uses a mix network architecture to provide strong anonymity, and prevent eavesdroppers and other attackers from linking senders and recipients. Volunteers run servers (called \"mixes\") that receive messages, decrypt them, re-order them, and re-transmit them toward their eventual destination. Every e-mail passes through several mixes so that no single mix can link message senders with recipients.\n\nTo send an anonymous message, mixminion breaks it into uniform-sized chunks (also called \"packets\"), pads the packets to a uniform size, and chooses a path through the mix network for each packet. The software encrypts every packet with the public keys for each server in its path, one by one. When it is time to transmit a packet, mixminion sends it to the first mix in the path. The first mix decrypts the packet, learns which mix will receive the packet, and relays it. Eventually, the packet arrives at a final (or \"exit\") mix, which sends it to the chosen recipient. Because no mix sees any more of the path besides the immediately adjacent mixes, they cannot link senders to recipients.\n\nMixminion supports Single-Use Reply Blocks (or SURBs) to allow anonymous recipients. A SURB encodes a half-path to a recipient, so that each mix in the sequence can unwrap a single layer of the path, and encrypt the message for the recipient.

The channel shares studio facilities and offices with WJLA-TV and the Rosslyn-based \"Circa News\" in Arlington, Virginia. WJLA 24/7 News reaches more than 1.2 million cable television households within the D.C metropolitan area.\n\nThe channel was launched on October 7, 1991 as NewsChannel 8. The \"8\" branding was selected as a part of the name to attempt to get Washington-area cable providers to place the channel between its parent ABC-affiliated station, WJLA-TV (at channel 7), and local CBS affiliate WUSA-TV on channel 9. Allbritton also bundled the channel along with WJLA in carriage contracts. In 1995, the channel began airing timeshifted ABC News programs hours or days after their original broadcast.\n\nNewsChannel 8 initially only had ad revenue stream until federal regulations required cable operators to pay for its carriage. In 1997, the channel was reported as profitable and started a streak of profitability by Allbritton.\n\nAs NewsChannel 8's carriage expanded to those areas, coverage was expanded to include Southern Maryland and Prince William County governmental meetings by the end of the 1990s. In July 2001, NewsChannel 8 beat CNN, Headline News, MSNBC and CNBC in the ratings, the highest viewership that the channel had ever accrued in its first 10 years. In August 2001, Comcast agreed to carry the channel for another 10 years. In August 2002, Allbritton Communications merged NewsChannel 8 and WJLA-TV with NewsChannel 8 laying off 30 of its 125 staff. The channel in Springfield and station in Northwest Washington moved to a Rosslyn section twin towers office complex in Arlington, Gannett Co. and USA Today's former home.\nOn September 5, 2006, Comcast moved NewsChannel 8, at the channel's request, to channel 28 on the analog tiers of some of its systems, placing it next to sister station WJLA-TV on channel 27 (Comcast's systems in the immediate Washington, D.C. area slot the market's broadcast stations in the 20-29 channel range; this is an artifact from when television stations broadcast in analog prior to the 2009 digital television transition in order to avert co-channel interference with the broadcast signals).\n\nSystems outside of Washington, D.C. proper carry it on channel 8, next to WJLA on channel 7. In all cases, however, the channel's high definition feed is carried on digital channel 808. On July 17, 2013, satellite provider DirecTV began carrying NewsChannel 8 on channel 8 within the Washington, D.C. market. On December 21, 2015, the channel was added to satellite provider Dish Network's D.C.-area broadcast lineup, also on channel 8.\n\nOn August 9, 2010, the channel was rebranded as TBD TV, in order to associate it with the recently established news website TBD.com, which provided news content for both the channel and WJLA. Allbritton subsequently reverted its news channel's branding to the original NewsChannel 8 name in February 2011.\n\nOn July 29, 2013, Allbritton Communications announced that it would sell its entire television group, including NewsChannel 8 and WJLA-TV, to Hunt Valley-based Sinclair Broadcast Group (owners of flagship station WBFF, as well as operators of two other stations in the adjacent Baltimore market).

The appropriate edition was fed to each of the cable systems in the region.

At only six weeks old, Kenan moved to Duplin County, a small rural community in North Carolina, where he lived with his grandparents in a small town named Wallace. The setting of many of Kenan's novels are centered around his homeland of North Carolina. The focus of much of Kenan's work centers around on what it means to be black and gay in the southern United States. Some of Kenan's most notable works include the collection of short stories \"Let the Dead Bury Their Dead\", named a New York Times Notable Book in 1992, \"A Visitation of Spirits,\" and \"The Fire This Time\". Kenan is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Whiting Award and the John Dos Passos Prize.\n\nRandall Kenan was born in Brooklyn, New York, but at only six weeks old he moved to a small town named Wallace where he lived with his grandparents. Kenan's grandparents ran a dry-cleaning business, and most of the time they were too busy to take care of Kenan themselves, so they hired someone to take care of him. On the weekends, Kenan's great-aunt Mary and great-uncle Redden would take him to their family farm which was located in Chinquapin, only about 15 miles east of Wallace. At three years old Kenan's great-uncle Redden died unexpectedly, and Kenan's grandfather suggested to his great-aunt Mary that she keep Kenan because she was alone. Kenan recalls the conversation and after that he remained with his great-aunt Mary for the remainder of his adolescent years. \n\nKenan's great-aunt Mary, who he eventually called 'mama,' became a mentor for Kenan, and she taught him how to read at the age of four years old. Mary was a kindergarten teacher so she heavily supported education and began Kenan's education at a young age. He grew up loving to read everything ranging from novels to comic books to the Bible, and he eventually developed a love for storytelling. \n\nKenan attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, beginning in the fall of 1981 and he graduated in 1985 with degrees in English and Creative Writing. In his freshman year of college Kenan was pursuing a physics degree, but found himself confused on what to pursue because he was not enjoying his classes. He then decided to enroll in a writing class lead by Max Steele, who is an editor for \"The Paris Review\". Kenan also studied with the author Doris Betts who tried to get Kenan a job in publishing in New York city. Despite Doris Betts efforts, Kenan did not get a job in New York right away, and it was not until a few months after graduation that Kenan received an offer to work for the publication company Random House in New York City.\n\nHe was hired at Random House originally because the company \"had gotten into trouble with the Equal Opportunity Commission\" and they wanted to increase the number of minorities they had working at the company.  After doing odd jobs at Random House, Kenan was able to secure a job at Alfred A. Knopf as a receptionist, where he had opportunities to study his craft.  Kenan worked at Knopf for only two months before he was promoted to assistant to the executive vice president, where he remained in that position for five years. While in the assistant position, until 1989, Kenan had the opportunity to edit dozens of books, which helped him improve in his own craft of storytelling. The experience working at Knopf helped Kenan in finalizing what would become his first published novel, \"A Visitation of Spirits\", in 1992.\n\nAfter publishing \"A Visitation of Spirits\", Kenan began teaching at three different universities part time. He taught at Sarah Lawrence College, Columbia University, and Vassar College once a week each, which gave him plenty of time to work on his own writing. Kenan is currently, a full time professor of English at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He has also served as a visiting writer or writing in residence at a number of other universities, including the University of Mississippi, the University of Memphis, Duke University and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\nKenan's first novel, \"A Visitation of Spirits\", was published in 1989. While a few critics praised the book, it did not receive much attention, but this changed with the publication in 1992 of Kenan's second book, a collection of short stories titled \"Let the Dead Bury Their Dead\". The stories, based in the fictional community of Tims Creek, focused on (among other things) what it meant to be poor, black, and gay in the southern United States. The book was hailed as a revival of classic southern literature and was nominated for the \"Los Angeles Times\" Book Award for Fiction, was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and was named a \"New York Times\" Notable Book. The short story collection also brought renewed attention to his first novel, which was likewise set in Tims Creek.\nIn 1993, Kenan published a young adult biography of gay African American novelist and essayist James Baldwin. Kenan has frequently stated that Baldwin is one of his idols. He then spent several years traveling across America and Canada collecting oral histories of African Americans, which he published in \"Walking on Water: Black American Lives at the Turn of the Twenty-first Century\" (1999).\n\nKenan has won a number of writing awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Whiting Award, the Sherwood Anderson Award, the John Dos Passos Prize, and the Rome Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\n\nIn 2007 Kenan published \"The Fire This Time,\" a book whose title was taken from James Baldwin's \"The Fire Next Time.\" It is a work of nonfiction.\n\nKenan's book in progress is titled \"There's a Man Going 'Round Taking Names\", which Kenan hopes to publish in the next few years.\n\n\n"}

It is an excellent thermal insulator and among the least dense solids known. SEAgel was invented by Robert Morrison at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 1992. SEAgel is made of agar, a carbohydrate material that comes from kelp and red algae, and has a density of 200 mg/cm.\nSEAgel can be made lighter than air using hydrogen, causing it to float or hang in the air. It insulates against temperature, noise, and electric current. SEAgel is also completely biodegradable, as it is made entirely of biological material and can even be eaten.\n\nInitially, SEAgel starts out as a gelatin-like mixture of agar and water. After it is freeze-dried to remove the water, it is left as a honeycomb of dried agar filled with air, with cell sizes two to three micrometers (2-3 µm) in diameter.\n\nSEAgel can have many different uses. Laboratory scientists use SEAgel as targets for x-ray laser experiments because it can be doped with other materials, such as selenium. In order to eliminate the volatile hydrodynamics that occur when a solid-density target explodes before it reaches the density required for lasing, scientists are trying to develop an x-ray laser target with a density that is less than the critical density of laser light (4×10 electrons/cm for 0.53-µm light). SEAgel can help them achieve a more uniform plasma, which will ultimately improve the quality of the x-ray laser beam.\n\nSEAgel could also be used as food packaging or the encapsulating material of timed-release medical pills, as it is safe to digest. SEAgel could also replace balsa wood, to insulate supertankers, and to provide sound damping in high-speed trains.\n\nSEAgel was covered under U.S. patents 5,382,285 (\"Biofoam\") and 5,360,828 (\"Biofoam II\").\n\n"}

Vaikundar, realizing that forbearance and fortitude were the essential virtues needed in his project of transforming the world, becalmed himself and performed the Tavam (Meditation). Having justice in his breath, the thought of mercy in his mind, and renouncing the desires of the body and containing the tendencies of his ego, Vaikundar performed the Tavam concentrating totally on the commands he had received from his father. His appearance was squalid, with holy ashes smeared on him, and the long unkempt hair flowing in the air.\nThis tavam was so effective that it surpassed the Tavam undertaken even by Isvaran previously. He undertook to perform a six-year tavam, divided into three phases, for three different causes. \n\n\nWithin these six years, a great multitude of people - old and young, men and women- came to him from all directions.

He also worked as a sports agent and football pundit in his later life.\n\nHe began his career in Scottish Junior football with Shawfield, before earning a professional contract with English First Division club Leicester City in December 1956. He played in two FA Cup final defeats before he was sold to Arsenal for £80,000 in October 1964. He had a poor start to his career at Arsenal, though he did feature in two League Cup final defeats, but he found success at the club after being switched from right-half to centre-half in 1969. Appointed as captain he led the club to their first European trophy, the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1970. The following season, 1970–71, he captained Arsenal to the Double, as they won the league and the FA Cup. He was sold to Queens Park Rangers in June 1973 for a fee of £25,000, and helped the club to finish as First Division runners-up in 1975–76 before he announced his retirement in May 1977. He scored a total of 66 goals in 766 league and cup games in a 20-year professional career, and won nine caps for Scotland in an eight-year international career.\n\nHe was appointed manager of Leicester City in June 1977, but resigned in April 1978 with the club heading out of the First Division. After a spell coaching at QPR he returned to management with Brentford in February 1984. He took the \"Bees\" to the 1985 Football League Trophy Final, before he resigned in January 1987. He later worked as assistant manager at Millwall before becoming a sports agent and football pundit.\n\nMcLintock was born in Sandyfaulds Street, Glasgow, and brought up in the Oatlands area of the Gorbals. He was the son of Catherine, a cleaner, and Archie McLintock, a casual labourer, and grew up in poverty with elder sister Jean. He was brought up Catholic and attended the local Catholic school, St Bonaventure's. However he hated the sectarianism in Glasgow.\n\nMcLintock started his semi-professional career at the age of 15 in the Scottish Juniors with his local club, Shawfield. He worked during the week as an apprentice painter and decorator. He soon began attracting interest from Scottish and English clubs, but decided to join an English club as he did not want to join a Scottish club only to be sent back on loan in the Junior leagues to gain experience.\n\nHe had a successful trial with Leicester City in December 1956, and was offered a part-time contract on his 17th birthday, with Shawfield receiving a £400 fee. At his mother's insistence he continued his painting and decorating apprenticeship in Leicester, and would continue in the trade alongside playing football for the next five years. He found it easy to settle at the club as manager Dave Halliday and a total of 27 players and trainers at Filbert Street were Scottish. He was initially quite short but experienced a growth spurt, and gained extra leg muscles as he cycled to and from work and training. In fact McLintock's initial physique meant Halliday was keen to terminate his contract, but he was persuaded not to by coach Matt Gillies, who had witnessed the extra training McLintock put in every day. In his spare time he also trained with his left foot to become a two-footed player.\n\nGillies replaced Halliday as manager, and handed McLintock his debut eight games into the 1959–60 season, a 3–3 draw with Blackpool at Bloomfield Road. He kept his first team place and picked up two man of the match awards but after a mistimed tackle on Arsenal's Jackie Henderson he was initially diagnosed with extensive cartilage damage in his right knee and was scheduled in for a risky surgical procedure, but after demanding a second opinion he was diagnosed with a sprain and was sidelined for sixteen weeks. He returned to action in February after replacing new signing Ian White in the starting eleven, and scored his first goal for the \"Foxes\" in a 3–1 victory over Manchester United.\n\nHe was still struggling with his knee so missed the start of the 1960–61 season, but was returned to the starting line-up in September as City began to put a good set of results together, beating Manchester United 6–0, Arsenal home and away, and putting five goals past both West Ham United and Newcastle United. They went on to reach the 1961 FA Cup Final against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley Stadium; the day before the final McLintock painted a cellar as part of his painting and decorating job. An injury sustained by Len Chalmers early in the game meant that McLintock was shifted from right-half to fill in at right-back, and ten-men Leicester fell to a 2–0 defeat. In the summer he qualified as a painter and decorator, and immediately quit his job to focus on full-time football. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly made a transfer bid for him, but was rebuffed by the Leicester board, as was Leeds United manager Don Revie.\n\nThe 1961–62 campaign represented a step back for Leicester as they dropped eight places down to 14th place. Injury meant McLintock featured in only one European Cup Winners' Cup game, a 1–1 home draw with eventual winners Atlético Madrid, and prevented him from playing in the reverse fixture at the Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid which Madrid won. In the summer, McLintock and goalkeeper Gordon Banks refused to sign new contracts at the club as they demanded a £10 a week raise to £30 a week – the pair were vilified in the local press to such an extent that McLintock went into the offices of the \"Leicester Mercury\" to forcibly put his case across to the sports editor – and eventually after three months they settled for £28 a week.\n\nDuring the 1962–63 season he forged an effective half-back partnership with Colin Appleton and Ian King and was part of the revered \"Ice Kings\" team which won a series of games over the course of the brutal winter and came within nine points of winning the Football League. City were top of the First Division with five games to go but picked up only one point from these final five games. They also had an excellent run in the FA Cup to reach the 1963 FA Cup Final, and were installed as favourites ahead of Manchester United. However McLintock and his teammates were poor on the day, and United won the match 3–1. Having been on course for the Double in April, Leicester ended May with a fourth-place finish and as runners-up in the cup.\n\nEarly in the 1964–65 season McLintock was still unhappy with his contract at Leicester City and with what he perceived to be the club's lack of ambition. Despite the board relenting and offering him £80 a week to sign a new contract, he had already made up his mind to leave the club in favour of the chance to win \"cups and caps\" elsewhere and put in a formal transfer request.\n\nIn October 1964, McLintock was signed by Arsenal for a club record £80,000. He endured a poor début at Highbury, mishitting a back-pass to allow Nottingham Forest's John Barnwell – who ironically had been sold by Arsenal to finance McLintock's transfer – to score an easy goal. He found that manager Billy Wright had no identifiable system of play and McLintock soon regretted joining the club as his first four games all ended in defeat. He was in poor form in the 1964–65, 1965–66 and 1966–67 seasons but remained a regular first team player as the Gunners struggled in mid-table. He insisted that the club change strip from red and white to all red so as to rid the team of the stigma of failing to live up to the highly successful red and white Arsenal teams of previous years; the experiment lasted for just the 1966–67 season before Arsenal reverted to red and white. Dissatisfied with the club's management, he put in a transfer request, which was denied by the board.\nThe new management duo of Bertie Mee and Dave Sexton began to slowly turn the team around, and Arsenal improved to ninth place by the 1967–68 campaign. After Sexton's departure Don Howe was promoted to first team coach and continued to improve the team's training methods. They reached the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium in 1968, but were beaten 1–0 by Leeds United, with Arsenal having an equalising goal ruled out after McLintock was judged to have fouled goalkeeper Gary Sprake. In the summer he was named as Arsenal's Player of the Year and his initial four-year contract came to an end.\n\nHe was appointed as team captain for the 1968–69 season, taking over from Terry Neill, and signed a new four-year contract. For the second successive season Arsenal reached the League Cup final, and as opponents Swindon Town were from the Third Division McLintock expected that he would finally secure a trophy on his fourth visit to Wembley. However Swindon won 3–1 after extra-time and McLintock blamed an influenza outbreak that affected him and five other teammates on the day and also blamed the Horse of the Year Show for ruining the pitch. The disappointment did not detract from their league form however, and they secured a place in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup with a fourth-place finish.\n\nHe started the 1969–70 season at centre-half after initially filling in at the position for an injured Peter Simpson towards the end of the previous campaign; this in turn allowed George Graham to move back and play at centre-half. McLintock and Simpson formed a highly effective centre-back partnership, and soon mastered the offside trap. In Europe he missed the first two rounds due to injury, before returning to the starting eleven for victories over Rouen (France), FCM Bacău (Romania) and Ajax (Netherlands) to reach the final against Belgian club Anderlecht. Arsenal lost 3–1 in the first leg at Constant Vanden Stock Stadium as Anderlecht outplayed them. They turned the tie around at Highbury though and won the game 3–0 and the tie 4–3 to secure the club's first major trophy in 17 years.\n\nHe captained Arsenal to the Double in the 1970–71 season, in what was only the fourth time the feat had been accomplished in the history of the Football League. Aside from a 5–0 defeat to Stoke City, Arsenal built their success on a solid defence, and claimed ten 1–0 victories during the campaign. They secured the title with a 1–0 victory over North London derby rivals Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, Ray Kennedy scoring the winning goal. In the FA Cup final they beat Liverpool 2–1 after extra-time, with Charlie George scoring the winning goal. To complete the campaign McLintock was named as FWA Footballer of the Year.\n\nMcLintock later said that Arsenal were never the same force after Don Howe left to manage West Bromwich Albion in the summer of 1971, and that complacency crept into the squad. He felt that new coach Steve Burtenshaw was not tough enough on the squad and failed to keep the players focused. The pressing game was abandoned to suit new record signing Alan Ball, who was talented but did not fit the style of play that had brought the team success. McLintock held a clear the air meeting with the players in January, and asked the coaching staff not to attend, and though the team accepted that their standards had fallen the meeting still did not have the desired effect of improving performances. They exited the European Cup at the hands of Ajax, McLintock giving away a disputed penalty at the Olympic Stadium. They ended the 1971–72 league campaign in fifth place, six points behind champions Derby County. Arsenal did reach the FA Cup final, but were beaten 1–0 by Leeds United.\n\nHe was dropped midway through the 1972–73 campaign, and reacted badly to the news by exploding with anger towards Mee. He returned to the first team in February following an injury to Jeff Blockley, but was told by Mee his return was only temporary. He made a formal transfer request in March 1973, and in doing so gave up the chance to be granted a testimonial game for ten years' service to the club.\n\nMcLintock was signed by Queens Park Rangers in June 1973 for a fee of £25,000; he chose to join QPR ahead of West Bromwich Albion as he wanted to remain in the First Division. He spent the 1973–74 season in a centre-back partnership with Terry Mancini, in front of goalkeeper Phil Parkes and flanked by full-backs Dave Clement and Ian Gillard, and helped Rangers to an eighth-place finish in manager Gordon Jago's last season in charge.\n\nDave Sexton took charge from the 1974–75 campaign, and signed David Webb to replace Mancini who had moved on to Arsenal. McLintock enjoyed his time at Loftus Road and said that during the 1975–76 season Rangers \"were by miles the best football team in the country\". By March 1976 Rangers were in a two-way battle for the league title with Liverpool, and with three games to go they could win the league with three victories. However they were beaten by Norwich City and Liverpool won their remaining fixtures to become champions. He made 53 appearances in the 1976–77 campaign before announcing his retirement in May 1977.\n\nMcLintock made his debut for Scotland in a 4–3 defeat to Norway on 4 June 1963, replacing Dave Mackay on 78 minutes. In his third appearance for Scotland, against Spain on 13 June, he scored one of the goals in a 6–2 win. However, he rarely featured after this game as Mackay, Pat Crerand, John Greig, Bobby Murdoch, Pat Stanton and Billy Bremner were all preferred ahead of him at right-half.\n\nMcLintock joined his first club Leicester City as manager in June 1977, succeeding Jimmy Bloomfield who took the \"Foxes\" to an 11th-place finish in 1976–77. He sold striker Frank Worthington to Bolton Wanderers for £20,000 as the player needed a signing on fee and higher wages to avoid bankruptcy. He signed Alan Waddle in his place, who scored only one league goal for the club. He signed Eddie Kelly, David Webb, George Armstrong, Geoff Salmons and Lammie Robertson, all of whom were coming to the end of their careers. He spent £250,000 on Roger Davies, who also flopped at Filbert Street. City went through a spell where they had one win in 26 matches. He resigned in April 1978, with relegation into the Second Division all but confirmed.\n\nHe worked as a pundit for the BBC, before making his return to coaching when Terry Venables appointed him as a youth team coach at Queens Park Rangers in December 1982.\n\nHe was appointed as manager of Brentford in February 1984, with the \"Bees\" second-from-bottom in the Third Division. His more successful signings included defender Terry Evans, midfielder Andy Sinton and forward Robbie Cooke. He took Brentford to the final of the Football League Trophy in 1985, where they were beaten 3–1 by Wigan Athletic. He resigned in January 1987, and was replaced by Steve Perryman.\n\nHe worked as assistant manager to John Docherty at Millwall from July 1987 to February 1990, helping the \"Lions\" to win promotion as champions of the Second Division in 1987–88.\n\nMclintock found success as an after dinner speaker, and as a pundit for BBC Radio and Sky Sports. He worked as a sports agent in the 1990s.\n\nMclintock married Barbara Warner from Leicester in 1963, and the couple have four sons: Neil, Iain, Scott and Jamie.\n\nHe has written two autobiographies, \"That's The Way The Ball Bounces\" in 1969 and \"True Grit\" in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They include Kelleys Island, Pelee Island, the Bass Islands, and several others. The majority of these islands are under the sovereignty of the State of Ohio in the United States. Pelee Island is the only major inhabited island within the province of Ontario, while the smaller Middle Island is the southmost point of land in Canada.\n\nMost of the larger islands are popular tourist attractions, served by car ferries running from the mainland and between some islands. Some small airports and numerous private marinas offer other ways for visitors to reach the islands. Combined with nearby Sandusky and Port Clinton, Ohio, the islands are part of the collective area known regionally as \"Vacationland\".\n\nThe Lake Erie Islands are geologically part of the Silurian Columbus Limestone. When the Pleistocene ice sheets carved out the basin of modern-day Lake Erie, these hard rocks proved more resistant to erosion than the shales in the east, and as a result, Lake Erie's western end is much shallower than the basins in the east, so that the islands remain above water.\nQuarrying operations on Kelleys Island revealed glacial grooves in the bedrock, which would in time be regarded as some of the best direct evidence of the Pleistocene ice sheets available anywhere. The glacial grooves are now protected as part of Kelleys Island State Park.\nMost of the islands are supported financially via tourism. Grape growing and wineries were once the mainstay of the economy. Kelleys Island is heavily forested and woods have replaced vineyards there almost entirely. South Bass Island is more developed and still has a few vineyards. Pelee Island is the only major island where vineyards remain common. Limestone quarrying still occurs on Kelleys Island, and also there are a few hobby farms. South Bass, Middle Bass, North Bass, and Kelleys Islands all have active state parks part of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources with North Bass Island State Park being the largest at 593 acres and 90% of North Bass Island (also known as Isle St. George). \n\nMost of the islands are headed by a small group of year-round residents. However, eager vacationers often raise the populations dramatically during the summer months, most notable on South Bass Island, which is the most tourist-friendly of the islands despite its small size. The islands vary by year-round population of approximately 500 on South Bass Island, 100 for Kelleys Island, 40 at Middle Bass Island and 12 on North Bass Island.\n\nKelleys Island, Middle Bass, North Bass and South Bass (Put-in-Bay) have active school districts with North Bass Local School District being the last operating one-room schoolhouse in Ohio. Of the islands with year-round residents, only North Bass has no ferry service. Put-in-Bay Township Port Authority operates public airports for Middle, North and South Bass Islands. Kelleys Island and Pelee Island operate paved, public runways and Rattlesnake Island maintains a private grass landing strip. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2070741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070741", "title": "Drug action", "text": "Drug action\n\nThe action of drugs on the human body is called pharmacodynamics, and what the body does with the drug is called pharmacokinetics. The drugs that enter the human tend to stimulate certain receptors, ion channels, act on enzymes or transporter proteins. As a result, they cause the human body to react in a specific way.\n\nThere are 2 different types of drugs:\n\n\nOnce the receptors are activated, they either trigger a particular response directly on the body, or they trigger the release of hormones and/or other endogenous drugs in the body to stimulate a particular response.\n\nDrugs interact with receptors by bonding at specific binding sites. Most receptors are made up of proteins, and the drugs can therefore interact with the amino acids to change the conformation of the receptor proteins.\n\nThese interactions are very basic, just like that of other chemical bondings:\n\nMainly occur through attractions between opposite charges; for example, between protonated amino (on salbutamol) or quaternary ammonium (e.g. acetylcholine), and the dissociated carboxylic acid group. Similarly, the dissociated carboxylic acid group on the drug can bind with amino groups on the receptor.\n\nThis type of bond is very strong, and varies with the inverse of the distance between the atoms so that it can act over large distances.\n\nCation-π interactions can also be classified as ionic bonding. This type of interaction occurs when a cation, e.g. acetylcholine, interacts with the negative π bonds on an aromatic group of the receptor.\n\nIon-dipole and dipole-dipole bonds have similar interactions, but are more complicated and are weaker than ionic bonds.\n\nThere is a small but significant attraction between hydrogen atoms and polar functional groups (e.g. the hydroxyl [-OH] group). These so-called hydrogen bonds only act over short distances, and are dependent on the correct alignment between functional groups.\n\nReceptors are located on all cells in the body. The same receptor can be located on different organs, and even on different types of tissues. There are also different subtypes of receptor which elicit different effects in response to the same agonist. For example, there are two types of histamine receptor: H1 and H2. Activation of the H1 subtype receptor causes contraction of smooth muscle, whereas activation of the H2 receptor stimulates gastric secretion.\n\nIt is this phenomenon that gives rise to drug specificity. Of course, drugs do not only act on receptors: they also act on ion channels, enzymes, and cell transporter proteins. these hydrogen bonds are so powerful than the ionic bonds.\n\nWhen talking about the shape of molecules, biochemists are mainly concerned with the three-dimensional conformation of drug molecules. There are many isomers of a particular drug, and each one will have its own effects. Differences in isomer affect not only what the drug activates, but also changes the potency of each drug.\n\nPotency is a measure of how much a drug is required in order to produce a particular effect. Therefore, only a small dosage of a high potency drug is required to induce a large response. The other terms used to measure the ability of a drug to trigger a response are:\n\nDrug companies invest significant effort in designing drugs that interact specifically with particular receptors , since non-specific drugs can cause more side effects.\n\nAn example is the endogenous drug acetylcholine (ACh). ACh is used by the parasympathetic nervous system to activate muscarinic receptors and by the neuromuscular system to activate nicotinic receptors. However, the compounds muscarine and nicotine can each preferentially interact one of the two receptor types, allowing them to activate only one of the two systems where ACh itself would activate both.\n\nThe specificity of drugs cannot be talked about without mentioning the affinity of the drugs. The affinity is a measure of how tightly a drug binds to the receptor. If the drug does not bind well, then the action of the drug will be shorter and the chance of binding will also be less. This can be measured numerically by using the dissociation constant K. The value of K is the same as the concentration of drug when 50% of receptors are occupied.\n\nThe equation can be expressed as K = formula_1\n\nBut the value of K is also affected by the conformation, bonding and size of the drug and the receptor. The higher the K the lower the affinity of the drug.\n\n"}
{"id": "2070743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070743", "title": "Edyta Górniak", "text": "Edyta Górniak\n\nEdyta Anna Górniak () (born 14 November 1972) is a Polish pop singer with a career spanning 3 decades. She is noted for possessing a wide vocal range of approximately four octaves. Górniak started as a musical theatre actress in 1990. She performed in the most popular musical in Polish history, the Tony Award-nominated \"Metro\". Some of its shows took place on Broadway. With the performance at the Eurovision Song Contest 1994 Górniak began her career as a pop singer in her native country and internationally. She is the recipient of the Bronze Medal for Merit to Culture – Gloria Artis.\n\nAfter taking singing lessons, in 1989, aged 16, she gave her first public appearance on a Polish television talent show where she won with Sam Brown's hit song \"Stop!\". In 1990 she performed on the Opole Polish Song Festival in a contest for debuting singers with an honourable mention. During the next three years she performed in music theatres. She was the star of the musical \"Metro\" (\"Subway\") – the most popular and longest running homegrown musical in Polish history, which brought her to Broadway. In New York she was also offered a job by the Elite model agency, but she rejected it preferring to continue her career as a singer. Later she sang in next three musicals in Poland: \"Do grającej szafy grosik wrzuć\" (\"Put a Dime in the Jukebox\") with classic Polish pop songs from the pre-rock'n'roll era, \"Blues Minus\" with songs of Polish author Jonasz Kofta and \"Brel\" with Polish versions of songs sang by the Belgian singer-songwriter Jacques Brel. In 1993 Górniak took part in the Baltic Song Contest in Sweden and finished in third place.\nIn 1994, Górniak was the first Polish artist to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest, in which she claimed a highly creditable second place, which still stands as Poland's best showing in the contest. Her song was \"To nie ja\" (\"That's Not Me\"), which was also released on a single in English as \"Once in a Lifetime\".\n\n\"To nie ja\" proved to be her breakthrough in Poland, becoming there the biggest hit of 1994. Górniak was signed to Polish division of EMI. Her first studio album \"Dotyk\" (\"The Touch\") was released a year later, in May 1995 and sold half-million copies in Poland. It brought new hits \"Jestem kobietą\" (\"I'm a Woman\") and the eponymous \"Dotyk\", which was the biggest Polish hit of 1995. Górniak with her powerful voice and original beauty quickly became an idol of young generation in Poland. In 1996 she signed a contract in London with EMI International for five albums. However, she continued recording for the Polish market, and had three more hits in Poland: \"Kolorowy wiatr\" (\"Colourful Wind\") – Polish version of \"Colors of the Wind\" from the Disney movie \"Pocahontas\", a club hit \"Love Is on the Line\" (which was written by Kylie Minogue) and \"To Atlanta!\" (\"It's Atlanta\") – Polish hymn of the 1996 Olympic Games.\nGórniak released her first English-language album \"Edyta Górniak\" a year later, in November 1997. It was produced by Christopher Neil, who was responsible for the international success of Celine Dion. Songs were written by writers of many legendary pop classics like: Billy Steinberg (\"Like A Virgin\" for Madonna), Simon Climie (\"I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)\" for Aretha Franklin and George Michael), George Merrill and Shannon Rubican (\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\" for Whitney Houston), Siedah Garrett (\"Man in the Mirror\" for Michael Jackson) or Rick Nowels (\"Falling into You\" for Celine Dion). However, the mediocre success of the singles \"When You Come Back to Me\" (it was popular especially in Scandinavia and Portugal) and \"One & One\" (minor hit in France and Germany and the first hit of Polish act charted in history of the Music & Media's European Radio Top 50 airplay chart) let the album's global impact with sales of 500,000 copies internationally, including 150,000 copies in Poland. The journalist of legendary Billboard magazine Fred Bronson chose this album as one of the 20 best albums of the year 1998 all over the world.\n\nTwo songs from that album were successfully covered by other artists: \"One & One\" by Robert Miles in 1996 (before Górniak's original version was released as a single) – it went to No. 1 on the European singles chart and \"Perfect Moment\" by Martine McCutcheon in 1999 – it went to No. 1 in the UK. During the promotion of her international album, Górniak gave concert in Poland with legendary tenor José Carreras and recorded with him a new hit \"Hope For Us\" in 1997. She also had two more hits recorded for her Polish audience: \"Lustro\" (\"Mirror\") – Polish version of \"Reflection\" from the Disney movie \"Mulan\" in 1998 and \"Dumka na dwa serca\" (\"Dumy on Two Hearts\") – theme from the Polish movie \"With Fire and Sword\", which became the biggest Polish hit of 1999.\n\nIn 1999, Górniak went on tour through Poland and released internationally the concert album \"Live '99\" in September 1999. In 2000 in Spanish Television TVE her Eurovision song from 1994 was voted the best Eurovision song of the last decade. In 2002, she was dropped from EMI International and signed to Virgin Germany. Her second international studio album was released in Poland in March 2002 under the title \"Perła\" (\"Pearl\"), a year before its international premiere. It was written and produced mainly by the team Absolute, which earlier worked for Tina Turner and The Spice Girls on their latest albums. New songs also were written by Steve Kipner (\"Genie in a Bottle\" for Christina Aguilera) and John Reid (\"When The Heartache Is Over\" for Tina Turner). The Polish edition was a double album, which contained additional Polish brand new songs, including hits \"Jak najdalej\" (\"As Far As Possible\") and \"Nie proszę o więcej\" (\"I'm Not Asking for More\").\n\nGórniak was also asked to sing the Polish national anthem at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Busan, South Korea, which she did. However, her performance had a decidedly mixed reception, being sung at a much slower tempo than usual. In March 2003 international version of \"Perła\" was released, under the title \"Invisible\". A brand new club tune \"Impossible\" was the first international single from the album. Its mediocre success only in Germany, Austria and Switzerland made \"Invisible\" a commercial flop with over ten times worse international sales than her previous studio album.The Polish version called \"Perła\" went Gold in her native country in a time of phonographic crisis, selling 40,000 units. A year later she was dropped from Virgin and after ten years of cooperation she also left her Polish label. In that time she had another hit in Poland, \"Nie było\" (\"Never Been\"), recorded with Polish metal band Sweet Noise.\n\nThat same year she gave birth to her son, Allan. The father of her child was Dariusz Krupa, who worked with her as a guitarist. Together with Krupa she founded their own independent label, EG.Production and Krupa became her manager. First she started a collaboration with the Polish production team Mathplanete to record her new Polish album in a brand new style, with chill-out club music. In 2005, she released the single \"Lunatique\", which was performed in French. That year she married Dariusz Krupa.\n\nTo promote another club single \"Sexuality\" in 2006, Górniak appeared on the cover of Polish edition of Playboy magazine for the third time. Both singles recorded with Mathplanete flopped on charts, so she dumped the idea of recording club music. The same year she began working on her new international pop album, seeking a new major record label. She chose Sony BMG and the first results of this new direction were the songs \"Cygańskie serce\" (\"Gypsy Heart\") and \"Loving You\". In 2007, she sang another movie theme, this time for the Polish-language version of the animated Spanish movie \"Dragon Hill\".\n\nFrom March 2007 to November 2009, Górniak appeared as a judge in six seasons of the Polish version of the TV show \"Soapstar Superstar\", in which stars of TV series competed for a record deal.\n\nHer first studio album in five years, \"E.K.G.\", finally was recorded for her own label. It was released in October 2007 and promoted by the single and her first video in almost five years, \"List\" (\"Letter\"). It was a Polish version of Celine Dion's \"I Surrender\", which originally was given to her. \"E.K.G.\" has moved 40,000 copies in Poland.\n\nIn November 2008, she released a single \"To nie tak jak myślisz\" (\"It's Not How You Think\"), which was the movie theme from the Polish comedy \"To nie tak jak myślisz, kotku\". This song became another breakthrough in her career – her first after six years of absence from Polish radio and music television. She also recorded her Christmas album \"Zakochaj się na Święta w kolędach\" (\"Fall in Love With Carols on Christmas\"), released in December with the biggest newspaper in Poland, \"Gazeta Wyborcza\". In 2009, her marriage to Kupa had ended and she left their own independent label. In 2010, she took part in Taniec z gwiazdami, Polish edition of the TV show \"Dancing with the Stars\".\n\nIn 2011, she released the first single from her fifth studio album, \"Teraz – tu\" (\"Now – Here\") and directed it's video. Another single, \"On The Run\", also had the video co-directed by her. Later that year she released the single \"Oj... kotku\" (\"Oh... Kitty\"), which was the movie theme from the Polish comedy \"Pokaż kotku, co masz w środku\". Full album \"My\" (\"We\") was postponed several times until February 2012. It was released by her new own independent label Anaconda and brought brand new electro-pop sound. Next hits were singles \"Nie zapomnij\" (\"Don't Forget\") and the first dance tune since \"Impossible\", \"Consequences\" (the latter also with the video co-directed by her).\n\nAlso in 2012 she took part in the Polish edition of the TV show \"Clash of the Choirs\". The same year she gave her second concert in Poland together with José Carreras. In 2013, she recorded Frank Sinatra's classic \"All The Way\", together with Matt Dusk and became a judge of the third series of \"The Voice of Poland\".\n\nIn 2014, Górniak signed a new record deal with Universal Music and began works on new electro-pop album. She only released four singles from these sessions: \"Your High\" with two different videos, \"Glow On\" (both in 2014), \"Oczyszczenie\" (2015) and \"Grateful\" (2016). The latter she submitted for the Polish national final of Eurovision Song Contest 2016, where she finished in third place. In the meantime she returned to \"The Voice of Poland\" as a judge for seasons 5 (in 2014) and 6 (in 2015). In 2016, she became a judge of the new Polish TV music talent show for children and teenagers \"Hit, Hit, Hurra!\" and in 2017 she was announced as a coach of the first season of \"The Voice Kids\" in Poland. She coached Roksana Węgiel, who won the first season of The Voice Kids. Later Roksana Węgiel won the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018 in Minsk, Belarus. Górniak also released new singles: \"Andromeda\" with Donatan (2017), \"Dom dobrych drzew\" (\"House of good trees\") (2018) and Tylko ty (\"Only You\") (2018), which is a Polish version of The Andrews Sisters' \"Bei Mir Bistu Shein\", released for a movie \"Dywizjon 303. Historia prawdziwa\".\n\nIn November 2018, she performed at a special concert \"Sto lat\" held at the Royal Albert Hall in London to celebrate the one-hundredth anniversary of Poland regaining independence. In 2019, she was a contestant in the Polish edition of the TV show \"The Mole\".\n\nGórniak participated in the 12th season of Polish \"Dancing with the Stars\" – \"Taniec z Gwiazdami\". She was eliminated after the semifinal round.\n\n"}
{"id": "2070744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070744", "title": "Katy Trail (Dallas)", "text": "Katy Trail (Dallas)\n\nThe Katy Trail is a jogging, walking, inline skating, and bicycling path that runs through the Uptown and Oak Lawn areas of Dallas, Texas (USA), following the path of the old Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, which was known as MKT or the Katy.\n\nIn Dallas, abandoned railroad tracks that had once divided the downtown core are rapidly being transformed into the unifying Katy Trail, a linear , landscaped pedestrian, inline skating and bicycle trail system that runs through the most densely developed section of the city. Construction was started in spring 2000. Several features have already been completed, including the primary trail, two of four new entrance plazas and four of the six planned pedestrian bridges. Construction was completed in 2007 on the Thomsen Overlook plaza, overlooking Reverchon Park. An secondary jogging trail has left of construction, which will be completed once more funding is secured. The work is being carried out by The Friends of Katy Trail under a master plan created by The SWA Group office, in Dallas.\n\nThe trail consists of a concrete path for pedestrians and cyclists that runs from the American Airlines Center in Victory Park to Mockingbird Station (a DART light rail station) near Southern Methodist University. Next to the concrete path, a parallel soft recycled-rubber track is built for runners.\n\nThis adaptive re-use of unused railroad tracks—long a public eyesore and nuisance—unifies several important Dallas districts and provides a major recreational amenity for the more than 300,000 people who live and work within a mile of the trail (the southernmost trailhead is from downtown Dallas at the American Airlines Center). This new, partly completed linear greenway already attracts pedestrians and nature-lovers, both Dallas residents and visitors.\n\nThe Katy Trail is also directly responsible for an upsurge in property values and retail-restaurant sales in adjacent neighborhoods and developments. The April 21, 2006, \"The Dallas Morning News\" called Katy Trail \"one of our city’s favorite outdoor spaces\". Katy Trail has become such a popular jogging location that some Dallasites quip, \"The trains don’t run here any more...Dallas does.\"\n\nThe trail's life began when the Union Pacific Railroad, which had bought the Katy, donated the abandoned lines to the city in 1993.\nThe train tracks that are now the location of the Katy Trail formed the major east-bound route through Dallas of the former Missouri-Kansas-Texas (MKT or \"Katy\") Railroad, which shut down this segment of its network in the late 1980s. The stations, which had served Dallas residents on their trips east for so many years, were torn down, but the tracks remained.\n\nIn the early 1980s The Katy was initially considered for DART's Red and Blue lines to the Northeast, but the current route beneath Central Expressway was chosen instead.\n\nBy the early 1990s, Dallas residents, business people, and city and county officials proposed restoring the greenbelt along the railroad route and creating an urban park as part of the national Rails-to-Trails Conservancy program, established in 1986 and based in Washington, D.C.\n\nInitial funding for the project came through Dallas County and state grants. The Friends of the Katy Trail, a nonprofit organization, was founded in 1997 to organize public and private support for development and maintenance of the Katy Trail. Their capital campaign has since raised $11 million from government sources and $12 million from private funding and land donations.\n\nThe Katy Trail is intended to provide an effective way of connecting the various Dallas city parks running from White Rock Lake to the Trinity River Project park system along the Trinity River. The rail trail runs alongside Reverchon Park and the parks system along Turtle Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River.\n\nOriginally, the Dallas Park & Recreation Department planned a basic concrete pathway system along the railroad right of way. The Friends of the Katy Trail have greatly expanded that vision by hiring The SWA Group, an international landscape architecture, planning, and urban design firm, to create a $23 million master plan for two trails and an urban park connecting the West End district to Mockingbird Station.\n\nWhen completed over the next few years, Katy Trail will have a , concrete path for bicyclists and in-line skaters, an adjacent , soft-surface track for pedestrians, four major entrance plazas, ADA-compliant entrances, benches, landscaping, and drinking fountains for all users, including pets. It will be connected to the Trinity Strand Trail.\n\nThe planting plan is dominated by native Texas trees and plants, including chinkapin and Lacey oaks, perennial grasses, Flame Acanthus, and numerous species of native salvias and other plans which support water conservation.\n\nFor years, the abandoned railroad tracks had been populated by the homeless, drug dealers, and gangs. The master plan includes strategies to transform negative public perceptions of the Katy Trail through landscaping, lighting, and particularly in the design of nine public spaces at important crossings and intersections. For night-time safety without adding light pollution, reflective shield lamps atop poles direct light onto the trail. The public spaces have more intimate lighting and distinctive light fixtures.\n\n"}

{"id": "2070766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070766", "title": "Constitutional growth delay", "text": "Constitutional growth delay\n\nConstitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) is a term describing a temporary delay in the skeletal growth and thus height of a child with no physical abnormalities causing the delay. Short stature may be the result of a growth pattern inherited from a parent (familial) or occur for no apparent reason (idiopathic). Typically at some point during childhood, growth slows down, eventually resuming at a normal rate. CDGP is the most common cause of short stature and delayed puberty.\n\nChildren with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), the most common cause of short stature and pubertal delay in males, typically have slowed linear growth within the first 3 years of life. In this variant of normal growth, linear growth velocity and weight gain slows beginning as young as age 3–6 months, resulting in downward crossing of growth percentiles, which often continues until age 2–3 years. At that time, growth resumes at a normal rate, and these children grow either along the lower growth percentiles or beneath the curve but parallel to it for the remainder of the prepubertal years.\n\nAt the expected time of puberty, the height of children with CDGP begins to drift further from the growth curve because of delay in the onset of the pubertal growth spurt. Catch-up growth, onset of puberty, and pubertal growth spurt occur later than average, resulting in normal adult stature and sexual development. Although CDGP is a variant of normal growth rather than a disorder, delays in growth and sexual development may contribute to psychological difficulties, warranting treatment for some individuals. Recent studies have suggested that referral bias is largely responsible for the impression that normal short stature per se is a cause of psycho-social problems; non-referred children with short stature do not differ from those with more normal stature in school performance or socialization.\n\nCDGP is a global delay in development that affects every organ system. Delays in growth and sexual development are quantified by skeletal age, which is determined from bone age radio-graphic studies of the left hand and wrist. Growth and development are appropriate for an individual's biologic age (skeletal age) rather than for their chronological age. Timing and tempo of growth and development are delayed in accordance with the biologic state of maturity.\n\nApproximately 15% of patients with short stature referred for endocrinologic evaluation have CDGP. Individuals with CDGP and familial short stature represent another 23%. The frequency of CDGP may be underestimated because individuals with milder delays and those who are not psychologically stressed may not be seen by subspecialists. In a study of 555 (out of 80,000) schoolchildren below the third percentile in height for age with growth rates below normal (<5 cm/y), twice as many boys as girls were affected. CDGP was found in 28% of boys and 24% of girls, and another 18% of boys and 16% of girls had familial short stature in combination with CDGP.\n\nAlthough the epidemiologic data indicate that all variants of normal growth are twice as common in boys as in girls, referrals for short stature reflect an even more divergent sex ratio. This likely reflects greater concern about males who are shorter than their peers or who have delayed sexual development.\nNo racial bias has been identified. Patterns of growth consistent with CDGP occur in infants as young as 3–6 months. However, individuals often do not seek medical attention until puberty, when lack of sexual development becomes a concern and discrepancy in height from peers is magnified by the delay in pubertal growth spurt.\n\nPhysical examination findings in patients with CDGP are essentially normal, with the exception of immature appearance for age. Body proportions may reflect the delay in growth. During childhood, the upper-to-lower body ratio may be greater than normal, reflecting more infantile proportions. In adults, the ratio is often reduced (i.e., <1 in whites, <0.9 in blacks) as a result of the longer period of leg (long bone) growth.\n\nCDGP is thought to be inherited from multiple genes from both parents. The strong role of heredity is reflected in the 60-90% likelihood of this growth pattern in a family member of the same or opposite sex. A delay in the reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary pulse generator results in a later onset of puberty.\n\n"}

{"id": "2070772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070772", "title": "James Iremonger", "text": "James Iremonger\n\nJames Iremonger (5 March 1876 – 25 March 1956) was an English cricketer and one of the players most unlucky never to play Test cricket. He did play a number of minor matches on the 1911–12 Ashes tour and was considered many times between 1901 and 1905 for a place against Australia.\n\nBorn 5 March 1876, Norton, Yorkshire, England, Iremonger played 334 first-class matches for Nottinghamshire between 1899 and 1914, scoring 16,622 runs at 35.06 and taking 619 wickets with his right-arm medium-pace at 22.98. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1903.\n\nIremonger had had a trial in the then-annual \"Colts\" match (whereby a team of twenty potential first-class cricketers played an odds match against the senior Nottinghamshire team) in 1897. It was though he had the potential to strengthen Nottinghamshire's dreadfully weak bowling, so that the county engaged him as a bowler in 1899 and he played in five matches for the first eleven. However, he took only five wickets and never more than one in an innings. It was thought he had the accuracy and the strong physique at over to succeed but lacked any spin whatsoever and thus could never beat even ordinary batsmen.\n\nHowever, the following year his solid defence saw Iremonger establish himself in the first team as a batsman, but he was routinely criticised for lacking strokes and his figures with an average of only around 18 bore this out. It was thus a surprise when Iremonger jumped in the rank of batsmen in August 1901 with four centuries in successive matches and an average of 44.\n\nFor the following five years, Iremonger was one of the best batsmen in England, forming with Arthur Jones one of the best opening partnerships in the game. His exceptionally strong and watchful defence made him a very hard man to get out and he had developed a good range of strokes on the off-side – though his rather stiff style made him less than graceful to most spectators watching him. This first stage of Iremonger's career reached its peak in 1904 when he made 1,983 runs with an average above 60, including his highest score of 272 against Kent. 1907, despite Nottinghamshire winning the Championship, saw Iremonger decline badly as a batsman. He achieved a batting average of above 30 only once in the seven seasons from 1907 to 1913 and dropped down the order from 1910. Nevertheless, Iremonger always remained an extremely useful and obdurate bat in any crisis, and even in the wet summer of 1912 where he only once exceeded fifty, eight not outs gave him an average of 26.\n\nHowever, from 1908, with John Gunn and Hallam declining rapidly as bowlers, Iremonger surprisingly filled the breach in the county's attack. Although he had not infrequently been tried as a change bowler, Iremonger did not take five wickets in an innings until 1908, yet at the end of that year he had taken 57 wickets and headed the Nottinghamshire bowling averages. By 1910 his developing break-back and accuracy of length made him deadly on a worn or sticky wicket. The exceptional summer of 1911, though it was thought batsmen \"did not find him difficult\", saw Iremonger's nagging perseverance on the hardest of pitches rated so highly that he was taken to Australia for bowling alone. He did little and was never considered for the 1912 Triangular Tournament despite maintaining his form.\n\nHis last season of 1914 saw Iremonger frequently captain Nottinghamshire in the absence of any available amateur to carry out the job, and he regained some of the batting form of ten years before. His most notable feat, however, was bowling 66 consecutive overs unchanged against Hampshire at Southampton. This is an all-time record for most overs bowled by any bowler unchanged. When county cricket resumed after the war, Iremonger did not resume his first-class career, but he did play one match for Notts' Second XI in 1927, when he was 51 years old. He coached Nottinghamshire from 1921 to 1938, when he retired.\n\nIremonger lived to the age of 80, and was living in Nottingham at the time of his death on 25 March 1956.\n\nJames also played football for Nottingham Forest making his debut as a fullback in 1896 against Stoke and earned 2 caps for England. He spent fifteen years with Forest making over 300 appearances.\n\nJames's brother Albert Iremonger, the Notts County goalkeeper, also played first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire. His other brother, Harry, also played football for Nottingham Forest.\n"}

The band was initially conceived as a forum for the three to compose pop songs while awaiting the reformation of their previous band, Pablo's Triangle. As the weeks passed the reformation looked unlikely.\n\nWith a large catalog of songs already taking shape by early 2002, Head of Femur began to recruit musicians to flesh out the lineup for live performance. The nature of the music demanded more than the traditional rock band instrumentation, so strings, trumpet, and orchestral percussion were added along with drums and bass guitar. Head of Femur played their first show at a small club in Chicago in March 2002. They made plans to record a demo with local producer Jim Bentley and perform at Chicago's The Empty Bottle.\n\nOn the strength of that demo, Portland's Greyday Productions signed Head of Femur in November 2002. Recording sessions for the band's debut album, \"Ringodom or Proctor\", took place in March 2003. Ten of \"Ringodom\"'s eleven songs were among the first of the dozens composed by Elsener, Armstrong and Focht, and had been intended to comprise the first record since their inception. The album was recorded at Lincoln, Nebraska's Presto! Recording Studios with A. J. Mogis.\n\nFollowing more than a year of touring as an 8-piece (2 guitars, trumpet, trombone, violin, drums, keys, 4 vocals and percussion) with such acts as Bright Eyes and Rilo Kiley, as well as outings on their own, Head of Femur signed with Brooklyn's spinART Records in the summer of 2004.\n\nIn August 2004, Head of Femur set about recording their next full-length record. \"Hysterical Stars\" was recorded at Wall To Wall in Chicago with engineers Chris Brickley and Dan Dietrich and released in late May 2005.\n\nHead Of Femur spent 2005 touring with Architecture in Helsinki, Wilco, Dr. Dog, The Spinto Band, The Bruces, Andrew Bird, Matt Pond PA and headlining tours themselves. They were the first band on the first Intonation Music Festival and performed at the Wicker Park Festival, CMJ and SXSW.\n\nDuring a short break from touring in the Fall of 2005, the group laid down four tracks mostly live at Truckstop Studios in Chicago. The recordings showcased a more band-oriented sound as opposed to the multi-tracked orchestra captured on their first two albums. The songs, including covers from The Band and Neil Young and Crazy Horse were released in late 2005 as an iTunes exclusive EP. Head Of Femur finished up the year by stripping the lineup down to a more traditional five-piece lineup of the core trio plus Nick \"The Chancellor\" Westra on bass/vocals and Tyson Thurston on keys. This lineup played two shows on New Year's Eve in Chicago.\n\nMay 2007, Head of Femur had completed work on their third full-length, \"Great Plains\", due to be released March 25, 2008.\n\nAfter many members moved back to their home state of Nebraska in 2013, they were approached by Mike Semrad, owner of Sower Records, in early 2016 wanting to release a new record. Members had been working with Matt Focht, via the internet, working out tunes and being creative. After numerous sessions in Lincoln at Circle M Studios, 'Hear! Hear! Tunemaker' was finally completed in the Fall of 2016. The new vinyl record is set to be released February 2017 at the historic Pla Mor Ballroom.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2070801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070801", "title": "Operation Ke", "text": "Operation Ke\n\nThe Japanese decided to withdraw and concede Guadalcanal to Allied forces for several reasons. All attempts by the IJA to recapture Henderson Field, the airfield on Guadalcanal in use by Allied aircraft, had been repulsed with heavy losses. Japanese ground forces on the island had been reduced from 36,000 to 11,000 through starvation, disease, and battle casualties. IJN forces were also suffering heavy losses attempting to reinforce and resupply the ground forces on the island. These losses, plus the projected resources needed for further attempts to recapture Guadalcanal, were affecting strategic security and operations in other areas of the Japanese Empire. The decision to withdraw was endorsed by Emperor Hirohito on 31 December 1942.\n\nThe operation began on 14 January 1943 with the delivery of a battalion of infantry troops to Guadalcanal to act as rearguard for the evacuation. Around the same time, IJA and IJN air forces began an air superiority campaign around the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. During the air campaign, a US cruiser was sunk in the Battle of Rennell Island. Two days later, Japanese aircraft sank a US destroyer near Guadalcanal. The withdrawal was carried out on the nights of 1, 4, and 7 February by destroyers.\n\nAt a cost of one destroyer sunk and three damaged, the Japanese evacuated 10,652 men from Guadalcanal. During the evacuation 600 died and 3,000 more required extensive hospital care. On 9 February, Allied forces realized that the Japanese were gone and declared Guadalcanal secure, ending the six-month campaign for control of the island.\n\nOn 7 August 1942, the US 1st Marine Division landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the US and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign with the eventual goal of capturing or neutralizing the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.\n\nTaking the Japanese by surprise, by nightfall on 8 August the Marines secured Tulagi and nearby islands as well as the Japanese airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal. The Allies later renamed it \"Henderson Field\". Allied aircraft operating out of Henderson were called the \"Cactus Air Force\" (CAF) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal.\n\nIn response to the landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters (IGH) assigned the Imperial Japanese Army's (IJA) 17th Army, a corps-sized command headquartered at Rabaul under the command of Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake, the task of retaking Guadalcanal. Because of the threat by CAF aircraft, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) was unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island. Instead, warships based at Rabaul and the Shortland Islands were used to carry forces to Guadalcanal. The Japanese warships, mainly light cruisers and destroyers from the Eighth Fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa, were usually able to make the round trip down \"The Slot\" to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack. These high speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the \"Tokyo Express\" by Allied forces and \"Rat Transportation\" by the Japanese.\nUsing forces delivered to Guadalcanal in this manner, the IJA tried three times to retake Henderson Field, but was defeated each time. After the third failure, an attempt by the IJN to deliver the rest of the IJA 38th Infantry Division and its heavy equipment failed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal from 12–15 November. Because of this failure, the Japanese cancelled their next planned attempt to recapture Henderson Field.\n\nIn mid-November, Allied forces attacked the Japanese at Buna-Gona in New Guinea. Japanese Combined Fleet naval leaders, headquartered at Truk and under the overall command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, felt Allied advances in New Guinea posed a greater threat to the security of the Japanese Empire than an Allied military presence in the southern Solomons. Therefore, Combined Fleet naval staff officers began to prepare plans for abandoning Guadalcanal and shifting priorities and resources to operations around New Guinea. At this time, the navy did not inform the army of their intentions in this regard.\n\nAs December began, the Japanese experienced considerable difficulty in keeping their troops on Guadalcanal resupplied because of Allied air and naval attacks on the Japanese supply chain of ships and bases. The few supplies delivered to the island were not enough to sustain Japanese troops who, by 7 December, were losing about 50 men each day to malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. The Japanese had delivered almost 30,000 army troops to Guadalcanal since the campaign began, but by December only about 20,000 of that number were still alive; of those, only around 12,000 remained more or less fit for combat duty, with the rest incapacitated by battle wounds, disease, or malnutrition.\n\nThe IJN continued to suffer losses and damage to its ships in attempting to keep the Japanese on Guadalcanal resupplied. One destroyer was sunk by American warships at the Battle of Tassafaronga on 30 November. Another destroyer plus a submarine were sunk and two destroyers damaged by American PT boat and CAF air attacks during subsequent resupply missions from 3–12 December. Compounding the navy's frustration, very few of the supplies carried on these missions reached IJA forces on the island. Combined Fleet leaders began telling their army counterparts the losses and damage to warships engaged in the resupply effort threatened future strategic plans for protecting the Japanese Empire.\n\nThroughout November, Japan's top military leaders at the IGH in Tokyo continued to openly support further efforts to retake Guadalcanal from Allied forces. At the same time, lower-ranking staff officers began to discreetly discuss abandoning the island. Takushiro Hattori and Masanobu Tsuji, each of whom had recently visited Guadalcanal, told their colleagues on the staff that any further attempt to retake the island was a lost cause. Ryūzō Sejima reported that the attrition of IJA troop-strength on Guadalcanal was so unexpectedly severe that future operations would be untenable. On 11 December two staff officers, IJN Commander Yuji Yamamoto and IJA Major Takahiko Hayashi, returned to Tokyo from Rabaul and confirmed Hattori's, Tsuji's, and Sejima's reports. They further reported that most of the IJN and IJA officers at Rabaul appeared to support abandoning Guadalcanal. Around this time, Japan's War Ministry informed the IGH that there was insufficient shipping to support both the effort to retake Guadalcanal and transport strategic resources to maintain Japan's economy and military forces.\n\nOn 19 December, a delegation of IGH staff officers led by IJA Colonel Joichiro Sanada, chief of the IGH's operations section, arrived at Rabaul for discussions about future plans concerning New Guinea and Guadalcanal. Hitoshi Imamura, commander of the 8th Area Army in charge of IJA operations in New Guinea and the Solomons, did not directly recommend a withdrawal from Guadalcanal but openly and clearly described the current difficulties involved with any further attempts to retake the island. Imamura also stated that any decision to withdraw should include plans to evacuate as many of the soldiers from Guadalcanal as possible.\n\nSanada returned to Tokyo on 25 December and recommended to the IGH that Guadalcanal be abandoned immediately and all priority given to the campaign in New Guinea. The IGH's top leaders agreed with Sanada's recommendation on 26 December and ordered their staffs to begin drafting plans for the withdrawal from Guadalcanal and establishment of a new defense line in the central Solomons.\n\nOn 28 December, General Hajime Sugiyama and Admiral Osami Nagano personally informed Emperor Hirohito of the decision to withdraw from Guadalcanal. On 31 December, the Emperor formally endorsed the decision.\n\nOn 3 January, IGH informed the 8th Area Army and the Combined Fleet of the decision to withdraw from Guadalcanal. By 9 January, the Combined Fleet and 8th Area Army staffs together completed the plan, officially called Operation Ke after a mora in Japanese Kana vocabulary, to execute the evacuation.\n\nThe plan called for a battalion of IJA infantry to land by destroyer on Guadalcanal around 14 January to act as a rear guard during the evacuation. The 17th Army was to begin withdrawing to the western end of the island about 25 or 26 January. An air superiority campaign around the southern Solomons would begin on 28 January. The 17th Army would be picked up in three lifts by destroyers the first week of February with a target completion date of 10 February. At the same time, Japanese air and naval forces would conduct conspicuous maneuvers and minor attacks around New Guinea and the Marshall Islands along with deceptive radio traffic to try to confuse the Allies as to their intentions.\nYamamoto detailed aircraft carriers and , battleships and – with four heavy cruisers and a destroyer as the screening force – under Nobutake Kondō to provide distant cover for \"Ke\" around Ontong Java in the northern Solomons. The evacuation runs were to be carried out by Mikawa's 8th Fleet, consisting of heavy cruisers and , light cruiser , and 21 destroyers. Mikawa's destroyers were charged with conducting the evacuation. Yamamoto expected that at least half of Mikawa's destroyers would be sunk during the operation.\n\nSupporting the air superiority portion of the operation were the IJN's 11th Air Fleet and the IJA's 6th Air Division, based at Rabaul with 212 and 100 aircraft, respectively. 64 aircraft from carrier s air group were also temporarily assigned to Rabaul. An additional 60 floatplanes from the IJN's \"R\" Area Air Force, based at Rabaul, Bougainville and the Shortland Islands, brought the total number of Japanese aircraft involved in the operation to 436. The combined Japanese warship and naval air units in the area formed the Southeast Area Fleet, commanded by Jinichi Kusaka at Rabaul.\n\nOpposing the Japanese and under the command of United States Navy Admiral William Halsey, Jr., commander of Allied forces in the South Pacific, were fleet carriers and , six escort carriers, three fast battleships, four old battleships, 13 cruisers, and 45 destroyers. In the air, the 13th Air Force numbered 92 fighters and bombers under United States Army Brigadier General Nathan F. Twining and the CAF on Guadalcanal counted 81 aircraft under US Marine Brigadier General Francis P. Mulcahy. Rear Admiral Aubrey Fitch was overall commander of Aircraft South Pacific. The air units of the fleet and escort carriers added another 339 aircraft. In addition, 30 heavy bombers were stationed in New Guinea with sufficient range to conduct missions over the Solomon Islands. In total, the Allies possessed around 539 aircraft available to oppose the \"Ke\" operation.\n\nBy the first week of January, disease, starvation, and battle had reduced Hyakutake's command to about 14,000 troops, with many of them too sick and malnourished to fight. The 17th Army possessed three operable field cannon, with very little ammunition. In contrast, the Allied commander on the island, US Army Major General Alexander Patch, fielded a combined force of US Army and US Marines, designated the XIV Corps, totaling 50,666 men. At Patch's disposal were 167 artillery weapons, including , , and howitzers, and plentiful stocks of shells.\n\nOn 1 January, the Japanese military changed their radio communication codes, making it more difficult for Allied intelligence, which had previously partially broken Japanese radio ciphers, to divine Japanese intentions and movement. As January progressed, Allied reconnaissance and radio traffic analysis noted the buildup of ships and aircraft at Truk, Rabaul, and the Shortland Islands. Allied analysts determined that the increased radio traffic in the Marshalls was a deception meant to divert attention from an operation about to take place in either New Guinea or the Solomons. Allied intelligence personnel misinterpreted the nature of the operation; on 26 January, the Allied Pacific Command's intelligence section informed Allied forces in the Pacific that the Japanese were preparing for a new offensive, called \"Ke\", in either the Solomons or New Guinea.\n\nOn 14 January, an Express mission of nine destroyers delivered the Yano Battalion, designated as the rear guard for the \"Ke\" evacuation, to Guadalcanal. The battalion, commanded by Major Keiji Yano, consisted of 750 infantry and a battery of mountain guns crewed by another 100 men. Accompanying the battalion was Lieutenant Colonel Kumao Imoto, representing the 8th Area Army, who was to deliver the evacuation order and plan to Hyakutake. The 17th Army had not yet been informed of the decision to withdraw. CAF and 13th Air Force air attacks on the nine destroyers during their return trip damaged destroyers and and destroyed eight Japanese fighters escorting the convoy. Five American aircraft were shot down.\n\nLate on 15 January, Imoto reached 17th Army's headquarters at Kokumbona and informed Hyakutake and his staff of the decision to withdraw from the island. Grudgingly accepting the order on the 16th, the 17th Army staff communicated the \"Ke\" evacuation plan to their forces on the 18th. The plan directed the 38th Division, which was currently defending against an American offensive on ridges and hills in the interior of the island, to disengage and withdraw towards Cape Esperance on the western end of Guadalcanal beginning on the 20th. The 38th's retirement would be covered by the 2nd Infantry Division, in place on Guadalcanal since October 1942, and the Yano Battalion, both of which would then follow the 38th westward. Any troops unable to move were encouraged to kill themselves to \"uphold the honor of the Imperial Army\".\n\nPatch initiated a new offensive just as the 38th Division began to withdraw from the inland ridges and hills that it had occupied. On 20 January, the 25th Infantry Division, under Major General J. Lawton Collins, attacked several hills, designated Hills 87, 88, and 89 by the Americans, that formed a ridge that dominated Kokumbona. Encountering much lighter resistance than anticipated, the Americans seized the three hills by the morning of 22 January. Shifting forces to exploit the unexpected breakthrough, Collins quickly continued the advance and captured the next two hills, 90 and 91, by nightfall, placing the Americans in position to isolate and capture Kokumbona and trap the Japanese 2nd Division.\nReacting quickly to the situation, the Japanese hurriedly evacuated Kokumbona and ordered the 2nd Division to retire westward immediately. The Americans captured Kokumbona on 23 January. Although some Japanese units were trapped between the American forces and destroyed, most of the 2nd Division's survivors escaped.\n\nStill fearing a renewed and reinforced Japanese offensive, Patch committed the equivalent of only one regiment at a time to attack the Japanese forces west of Kokumbona, keeping the rest near Lunga Point to protect the airfield. The terrain west of Kokumbona favored the Japanese efforts to delay the Americans as the rest of the 17th Army continued its withdrawal towards Cape Esperance. The American advance was hemmed into a corridor only wide between the ocean and the thick, inland jungle and steep coral ridges. The ridges, running perpendicular to the coast, paralleled numerous streams and creeks that crossed the corridor with \"washboard regularity.\"\n\nOn 26 January, a combined US Army and Marine unit called the Composite Army-Marine (CAM) Division advancing westward encountered the Yano Battalion at the Marmura River. Yano's troops temporarily halted the CAM's advance and then slowly withdrew westward over the next three days. On 29 January, the Yano retreated across the Bonegi River, where soldiers from the 2nd Division had constructed another defensive position.\n\nThe Japanese defenses at the Bonegi held up the American advance for almost three days. On 1 February, with help from a shore bombardment by the destroyers and , the Americans successfully crossed the river but did not immediately press the advance westward.\n\nThe \"Ke\" air superiority campaign began in mid-January with nightly harassment attacks on Henderson Field by 3–10 aircraft, causing little damage. On 20 January, a lone Kawanishi H8K bombed Espiritu Santo. On 25 January, the IJN sent 58 Zero fighters on a daylight raid to Guadalcanal. In response, the CAF sent aloft eight Wildcat and six P-38 fighters, which shot down four Zeros without loss.\n\nA second large raid was conducted on 27 January by nine Kawasaki Ki-48 \"Lily\" light bombers escorted by 74 Nakajima Ki-43 \"Oscar\" fighters from the IJA's 6th Air Division from Rabaul. Twelve Wildcats, six P-38s, and 10 P-40s from Henderson met the raid over Guadalcanal. In the resulting action, the Japanese lost six fighters while the CAF lost one Wildcat, four P-40s, and two P-38s. The \"Lily\"s dropped their bombs on American positions around the Matanikau River, causing little damage.\n\nBelieving that the Japanese were beginning a major offensive in the southern Solomons aimed at Henderson Field, Halsey responded by sending, beginning on 29 January, a resupply convoy to Guadalcanal supported by most of his warship forces, separated into five task forces. These five task forces included two fleet carriers, two escort carriers, three battleships, 12 cruisers, and 25 destroyers.\nScreening the approach of the transport convoy was Task Force 18 (TF 18), under Rear Admiral Robert C. Giffen, with three heavy and three light cruisers, two escort carriers, and eight destroyers. A fleet carrier task force, centered on carrier , steamed about behind TF 18.\n\nIn addition to protecting the supply convoy, TF 18 was charged with rendezvousing with a force of four U.S. destroyers, stationed at Tulagi, at 21:00 on 29 January in order to conduct a sweep up \"The Slot\" north of Guadalcanal the next day to screen the unloading of the transports at Guadalcanal. As the escort carriers were too slow to allow Giffen's force to make the scheduled rendezvous, Giffen left the carriers behind with two destroyers at 14:00 on 29 January and steamed ahead.\n\nGiffen's force was being tracked by Japanese submarines, who reported on Giffen's location and movement to their naval headquarters units. Around mid-afternoon, based on the submarine's reports, 16 G4M from the 705 Air Group and 16 Mitsubishi G3M \"Nell\" bombers from the 701 Air Group took off from Rabaul carrying torpedoes to attack Giffen's force, now located between Rennell Island and Guadalcanal.\n\nThe torpedo bombers attacked Giffen's ships in two waves between 19:00 and 20:00. Two torpedoes hit the heavy cruiser , causing heavy damage and bringing her to a dead stop. Three of the Japanese aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships. In response, Halsey sent a tug to take \"Chicago\" under tow and ordered Giffen's task force to return to base the next day. Six destroyers were left behind to escort \"Chicago\" and the tugboat.\n\nAt 16:00 on 30 January, a flight of 11 Mitsubishi torpedo bombers from the 751 Air Group, based at Kavieng and staging through Buka, attacked the force towing \"Chicago\". Fighter aircraft from \"Enterprise\" shot down eight of them, but most of the Japanese aircraft were able to release their torpedoes before crashing. One torpedo hit the destroyer , causing heavy damage. Four more torpedoes hit \"Chicago\", sinking her.\n\nThe transport convoy reached Guadalcanal and successfully unloaded its cargo on 30–31 January. The rest of Halsey's warships took station in the Coral Sea south of the Solomons to wait for the approach of any Japanese warship forces supporting what the Allies believed to be an imminent offensive. The departure of TF 18 from the Guadalcanal area removed a significant potential threat to the \"Ke\" operation.\n\nAt 18:30 on 29 January, two corvettes from the Royal New Zealand Navy, and , intercepted the Japanese submarine , which was attempting a supply run, off of Kamimbo on Guadalcanal. The two corvettes rammed and sank \"I-1\" after a 90-minute battle ().\n\nLeaving his cruisers at Kavieng, Mikawa gathered all 21 of his destroyers at the Japanese naval base in the Shortlands on 31 January to begin the evacuation runs. Rear Admiral Shintaro Hashimoto was placed in charge of this group of destroyers, titled the Reinforcement Unit. The \"R\" Area Air Force's 60 floatplanes were tasked with scouting for the Reinforcement Unit and helping defend against Allied PT boat attacks during the nighttime evacuation runs. Allied B-17 bombers attacked the Shortlands anchorage on the morning of 1 February, causing no damage and losing four aircraft to Japanese fighters. This same day, the IJA's 6th Air Division raided Henderson Field with 23 \"Oscar\"s and six \"Lily\"s but caused no damage and suffered the loss of one fighter.\nBelieving that the Japanese might be retreating to the south coast of Guadalcanal, on the morning of 1 February Patch landed a reinforced battalion of army and Marine troops, about 1,500 men under the command of Colonel Alexander George, at Verahue on Guadalcanal's south coast. The U.S. troops were delivered to the landing location by a naval transport force of six landing craft tanks and one transport destroyer (), escorted by four other destroyers (the same destroyers that were to have joined TF 18 three days earlier). A Japanese reconnaissance aircraft spotted the naval landing force. Believing that the force posed a threat to that night's scheduled evacuation run, an airstrike of 13 Aichi D3A2 \"Val\" dive bombers escorted by 40 Zeros departed Buin, Bougainville to attack the ships.\n\nMistaking the Japanese strike aircraft as friendly, the U.S. destroyers withheld fire until the \"Val\"s began their attack. Beginning at 14:53, destroyer was rapidly hit by three bombs and sank almost immediately south of Savo Island with the loss of 167 of her crew, including her captain. Destroyer was damaged by several near-misses. Five \"Val\"s and three Zeros were lost to anti-aircraft fire and CAF fighters. The CAF lost three Wildcats in the engagement.\n\nHashimoto departed the Shortlands at 11:30 on 1 February with 20 destroyers for the first evacuation run. Eleven destroyers were designated as transports screened by the other nine. The destroyers were attacked in the late afternoon near Vangunu by 92 CAF aircraft in two waves. , Hashimoto's flagship, was heavily damaged by a near miss. Four CAF aircraft were shot down. Hashimoto transferred to and detached to tow \"Makinami\" back to base.\n\nEleven U.S. PT boats awaited Hashimoto's destroyers between Guadalcanal and Savo Island. Beginning at 22:45, Hashimoto's warships and the PT boats engaged in a series of running battles over the next three hours. Hashimoto's destroyers, with help from \"R\" Area aircraft, sank three of the PT boats.\n\nIn the meantime, the transport destroyers arrived off of two pick-up locations at Cape Esperance and Kamimbo at 22:40 and 24:00 respectively. Japanese naval personnel ferried the waiting troops out to the destroyers in barges and landing craft. Rear Admiral Tomiji Koyanagi, second-in-command of the Reinforcement Unit, described the evacuees: \"They wore only the remains of clothes that were so soiled their physical deterioration was extreme. Probably they were happy but they showed no expression. Their digestive organs were so completely destroyed, we couldn't give them good food, only porridge.\" Another officer added that, \"Their buttocks were so emaciated that their anuses were completely exposed, and on the destroyers that picked them up they suffered from constant and uncontrolled diarrhea.\"\n\nAfter embarking 4,935 soldiers, mainly from the 38th Division, the transport destroyers ceased loading at 01:58 and prepared to depart for the return trip to the Shortlands. About this time, , one of the screening destroyers, was suddenly wracked by a large explosion, caused by either a PT boat torpedo or a naval mine. Informed that \"Makigumo\" was immobilized, Hashimoto ordered her abandoned and scuttled (). During the return trip, the Reinforcement Unit was attacked by CAF aircraft at 08:00, but sustained no damage and arrived at the Shortlands without further incident at 12:00 on 2 February.\n\nOn 4 February, Patch ordered the 161st Infantry Regiment to replace the 147th at the front and resume the advance westward. The Yano battalion retreated to new positions at the Segilau River and troops were sent to block the advance of George's force along the south coast. Meanwhile, Halsey's carrier and battleship task forces remained just beyond Japanese air attack range about south of Guadalcanal.\nKondō sent two of his force's destroyers, and , to the Shortlands to replace the two destroyers lost in the first evacuation run. Hashimoto led the second evacuation mission with 20 destroyers south toward Guadalcanal at 11:30 on 4 February. The CAF attacked Hashimoto in two waves beginning at 15:50 with a total of 74 aircraft. Bomb near-misses heavily damaged , and Hashimoto detached to tow her back to Shortland. The CAF lost 11 aircraft in the attack while the Japanese lost one Zero.\n\nThe U.S. PT boats did not sortie to attack Hashimoto's force this night and the loading went uneventfully. The Reinforcement Force embarked Hyakutake, his staff, and 3,921 men, mainly from the 2nd Division, and reached Bougainville without incident by 12:50 on 5 February. A CAF airstrike launched that morning failed to locate Hashimoto's force.\n\nBelieving that the Japanese operations on 1 and 4 February had been reinforcement, not evacuation missions, the American forces on Guadalcanal proceeded slowly and cautiously, advancing only about each day. George's force halted on 6 February after advancing to Titi on the south coast. On the north coast, the 161st finally began their attack westward at 10:00 on 6 February and reached the Umasani River the same day. At the same time, the Japanese were withdrawing their remaining 2,000 troops to Kamimbo.\n\nOn 7 February, the 161st crossed the Umasani and reached Bunina, about from Cape Esperance. George's force, now commanded by George F. Ferry, advanced from Titi to Marovovo and dug in for the night about north of the village.\n\nAware of the presence of Halsey's carriers and other large warships near Guadalcanal, the Japanese considered canceling the third evacuation run, but decided to go ahead as planned. Kondō's force closed to within of Guadalcanal from the north to be ready in case Halsey's warships attempted to intervene. Hashimoto departed the Shortlands with 18 destroyers midday of 7 February, this time taking a course south of the Solomons instead of down the Slot. A CAF strike force of 36 aircraft attacked Hashimoto at 17:55, heavily damaging with a bomb near miss. \"Isokaze\" retired escorted by \"Kawakaze\". The Allies and the Japanese each lost one aircraft in the attack.\n\nArriving off Kamimbo, Hashimoto's force loaded 1,972 soldiers by 00:03 on 8 February, unhindered by the U.S. Navy. For an additional 90 minutes, destroyer crewmen rowed their boats along the shore calling out again and again to make sure no one was left behind. At 01:32, the Reinforcement Group left Guadalcanal in its wake and reached Bougainville without incident at 10:00, completing the operation.\n\nAt dawn on 8 February, the U.S. Army forces on both coasts resumed their advances, encountering only a few sick and dying Japanese soldiers. Patch now realized that the Tokyo Express runs over the last week were evacuation, not reinforcement missions. At 16:50 on 9 February, the two American forces met on the west coast at the village of Tenaro. Patch sent a message to Halsey stating, \"Total and complete defeat of Japanese forces on Guadalcanal effected 16:25 today...the Tokyo Express no longer has a terminus on Guadalcanal.\"\n\nThe Japanese had successfully evacuated a total of 10,652 men from Guadalcanal, about all that remained of the 36,000 total troops sent to the island during the campaign. Six hundred of the evacuees succumbed to their injuries or illnesses before they could receive sufficient medical care. Three thousand more required lengthy hospitalization or recuperation. After receiving word of the completion of the operation, Yamamoto commended all the units involved and ordered Kondō to return to Truk with his warships. The 2nd and 38th Divisions were shipped to Rabaul and partially reconstituted with replacements. The 2nd Division was relocated to the Philippines in March 1943 while the 38th was assigned to defend Rabaul and New Ireland. The 8th Area Army and Southeast Area Fleet reoriented their forces to defend the central Solomons at Kolombangara and New Georgia and prepared to send the reinforcements, mainly consisting of the 51st Infantry Division, originally detailed for Guadalcanal to New Guinea. The 17th Army was rebuilt around the 6th Infantry Division and headquartered on Bougainville. A few Japanese stragglers remained on Guadalcanal, many of whom were killed or captured by Allied patrols. The last known Japanese holdout surrendered in October 1947.\n\nIn hindsight, historians have faulted the Americans, especially Patch and Halsey, for not taking advantage of their ground, aerial, and naval superiority to prevent the successful Japanese evacuation of most of their surviving forces from Guadalcanal. Said Chester Nimitz, commander of Allied forces in the Pacific, of the success of Operation Ke, \"Until the last moment it appeared that the Japanese were attempting a major reinforcement effort. Only the skill in keeping their plans disguised and bold celerity in carrying them out enabled the Japanese to withdraw the remnants of the Guadalcanal garrison. Not until all organized forces had been evacuated on 8 February did we realize the purpose of their air and naval dispositions.\"\n\nNevertheless, the successful campaign to recapture Guadalcanal from the Japanese was an important strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, ultimately culminating in Japan's defeat and the end of World .\n\n\n"}

This is an important event in Ayyavazhi mythology tells us about the happenings that took place when Lord Vaikundar was thrown before a three-days-starving tiger.\n\nAs per the order of the king of Thiruvithankur (Kalineesan), a commander summoned his soldiers and ordered them to fetch a tiger. They were threatened to be hanged if they failed in bringing a tiger. The soldiers, being terrified, implored Vaikundar to help them get a tiger. Lord Vaikundar, knowing their predicament, enabled them to get hold of a tiger. The soldiers, acknowledging and praising the divine powers of Vaikundar, returned to the prison with the tiger. The tiger was put in a cage for a few days without any food. On a particular day, in the presence of ministers, administrators, and different sections of the army Vaikundar was thrown into the tiger's cage. What a miracle it was! The tiger, knowing its creator, did not jump on the prey, but lay there unmoved. The soldiers, being vexed at the strange behaviour of the ferocious animal, tried to provoke it. One of the soldiers used the back of a long spear to prod the animal to action. It so happened that the tiger caught hold of the spear tightly, and, the soldier, trying to extricate the spear, pulled it out vehemently. Quite unexpectedly, the tiger left the spear and, alas, the sharp point of the spear pierced through a priest who was standing among the spectators and killed him.\n\nHearing the alarming news, fear gripped the king. He lamented saying: \"killing a priest will invite a curse more severe than that of killing a thousand cows\".He immediately withdrew his soldiers from torturing Vaikundar. On the other hand, devotees of Vaikuntar were enthralled, and their faith increased. They spread this news to one and all in every direction\".(see: Ayyavazhi mythology)\"\n\n\n"}

McCarthy that he had a list of individuals who were known by the Secretary of State to be members of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) yet who were still working in the State Department.\n\nThe mandate of the committee was to conduct \"a full and complete study and investigation as to whether persons who are disloyal to the United States are, or have been, employed by the Department of State.\"\nThe chairman of the subcommittee was Senator Millard Tydings, a Democrat from Maryland.\n\nOn February 20, 1950, McCarthy had delivered a 5-hour speech to the Senate in which he presented the cases of 81 \"loyalty risks\" who he claimed were working for the State Department. McCarthy declined requests to disclose the actual names of the people on his list, and instead referred to them by \"case numbers\". It is widely accepted that most of McCarthy's cases were taken from the so-called \"Lee list\"—a report that had been compiled three years earlier for the House Appropriations Committee. Led by former FBI agent Robert E. Lee, the House investigators had been allowed to review the security clearance documents on State Department employees, and had determined that there were \"incidents of inefficiencies\"\nin the security reviews of 108 past and present employees.\n\nThe Lee list was also the source of McCarthy's famous list of 57 \"cardcarrying Communists\" in the State Department.\nIn 1948, the State Department had informed the House that of the 108 cases flagged by Lee, 57 were still working for the department. This list included persons whom Lee had deemed security risks for a variety of reasons, such as marital infidelity or drunkenness, and all of them had been cleared by the State Department's review process.\n\nIn response to these allegations, the Tydings Committee hearings were held, opening on March 8, 1950 and lasting until July 17. At the hearings, McCarthy expanded on his original list of unnamed individuals and made charges against nine others whose names he made public: Dorothy Kenyon, Esther Brunauer, Haldore Hanson, Gustavo Duran, Owen Lattimore, Harlow Shapley, Frederick L. Schuman, John S. Service and Philip Jessup. Owen Lattimore became a particular focus of McCarthy's, who at one point described him as a \"top Russian spy.\"\n\nFrom its beginning, the Tydings Committee was marked by partisan infighting. Its final report, written by the Democratic majority, concluded that the individuals on McCarthy's list were neither Communists nor pro-communist, and said the State Department had an effective security program. Tydings labeled McCarthy's charges a \"fraud and a hoax,\" and said that the result of McCarthy's actions was to \"confuse and divide the American people[...] to a degree far beyond the hopes of the Communists themselves.\" Republicans responded in kind, with William Jenner stating that Tydings was guilty of \"the most brazen whitewash of treasonable conspiracy in our history.\" The full Senate voted three times on whether to accept the report, and each time the voting was precisely divided along party lines.\n"}

Other members were Peter Bernstein (bass, vocals), Steve Beers (percussion), and Steve Leonard (keyboards, vocals).\n\nBoth their albums were released on Richard Perry's Planet Records label. On the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, the group's one charted song, \"Real Love,\" peaked at no. 79 in June 1980; it was from their first album, \"Thin Red Line\". The song \"Empty Heart\", from their second album \"Snap Snap\", was their only other song to receive significant airplay on album rock stations, but it did not chart as a single.\n\nThey are perhaps best known as the band that provided three of the songs on Linda Ronstadt's Platinum-selling 1980 new wave rock album, \"Mad Love\".

He served as governor of the convict settlement at Norfolk Island from 6 August 1846 to 18 January 1853, and later as the inspector-general of penal establishments in Victoria, during which he was \"stoned to death\" by angry prisoners.\n\nPrice had aristocratic connections which aided him in securing the position. Although he was initially seen as restoring order after an incompetent predecessor, Price scoffed at the idea of rehabilitation for convicts. An enthusiasm for flogging for trivial breaches of discipline and extreme corporal punishments of his own devising led to his regieme being denounced. He left to farm, but was given responsibility for another prison in which his strongly punitive measures provoked a violent reaction.\n\nPrice was born in Trengwainton, Cornwall, to a slaveholding family. He was the fourth son of Sir Rose Price, first baronet, by Elizabeth his wife, daughter of Charles Lambart and sister of Frances, wife of the second Earl Talbot. Price studied at Charterhouse and Brasenose College, Oxford without taking a degree, and arrived in Hobart, Van Diemen's Land in May 1836 with letters of introduction from influential relatives. There he farmed in the Huon River district and married Mary, the eldest daughter of James Franklin and ward of Sir John Franklin, lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen's Land from 1836 to 1843.\n\nIn 1839 Price was appointed muster master of convicts and stipendiary magistrate. In 1846 he suffered an unknown illness and was recommended by Surgeon Bedford to take leave of absence 'or else he will be laid up seriously'. However, he was appointed commandant of Norfolk Island in July of that year, to replace Major Joseph Childs. One of Price's first duties was to arrange for the trial of 26 convicts alleged to have been involved in murders during the Cooking pot uprising of July 1846 at the end of Childs' administration. Twelve convicts were hanged in October, and five others shortly after. The executions broke the power of the feared 'Ring' clique of inmates. Price was a tall burly man who affected an extravagant style of dress and used underworld slang. He openly announced his intention was to break the inmates and went among them with few guards to emphasise his dominance, although he also carried two pepper-box pistols.\n\nPrices's ability to speak the argot of the criminal underworld made a deep impression on convicts and some thought he must have actually been imprisoned himself. A critic, Reverend Thomas Rogers, said that he would disguise himself as a constable and move around Hobart, seeking disorderly characters. Hazzard claims that \"he seemed to know, with terrifying accuracy, the way a criminal's mind worked, and this, coupled with his merciless administering of the Law, gave him an almost hypnotic power over them\". Another suggestion was that Price, who had an extremely close relationship with a convict overseer, was homosexual and had gained his knowledge and flashy dress sense from moving in the covert rough trade gay scene during his earlier life in England.\n\nBacked by Governor Denison, Price was answerable to no one but himself and he invented a series of punishments to cow his wards. Routine work cutting coral was done while chained to 36lb weights. Inmates were subject to flogging for the slightest infraction, and putting balm on a flogged man's wounds became an offence. His innovative corporal punishments included much use of restraints such as a cage over the head with a prong that immobilised the tongue and made breathing difficult, or an all encompassing steel frame that men were kept in for more than a week. By 1852 public disquiet caused Denison to privately remonstrate with Price. Hughes' claims that, in Hobart \"the suspicion that the commandant was out of control, that the island's remoteness from Hobart had permitted some cancer of his soul to metastasise wildly, could not entirely be allayed\". He hints at a connection between Price's unspecified illness in 1846, and \"the morbid ferocities of his rule\".\n\nPrice \"ruled by terror, informers and the lash\" according to one modern writer, a contemporary historian noted the \"merciless exercise of his authority\". Bishop Robert Willson, following his third visit to the island in 1852, described the harsh punishment of the convicts. He observed \"the state of the yard, from the blood running down men's backs, mingled with the water used in washing them when taken down from the triangle – the degrading scene of a large number of men … waiting their turn to be tortured, and the more humiliating spectacle presented by those who had undergone the scourging … were painful to listen to\". When Willson asked Price to explain the increased use of corporal punishment, the commandant \"defended his use of flogging, to which he professed great aversion, as necessary to enforce obedience to regulations, especially those controlling the use of tobacco\".\n\nPrice returned to Hobart in January 1853 as the British government intended to abandon Norfolk Island. He was appointed inspector-general of prisons in Victoria in January 1854, to deal with the problem of crime arising from the gold rushes in that colony.\n\nOn 26 March 1857, he visited prison hulk convicts living under his regieme employed at Williamstown. Accompanied by a small number of guards Price went toward the men but his party was quickly surrounded by about a hundred inmates. Almost immediately his guards broke and ran after a barrage of rocks. Price also tried to escape but he was knocked down and severely battered with the iron bars and hammers of the workers.. He died next day, and following the inquest, fifteen convicts were tried for murder, seven being hanged.\n\nThe seven convicts were Thomas Williams, Henry Smith (alias Brennan) & Thomas Moloney were hanged on the 28 April 1857, Francis Brannigan, William Brown & Richard Bryant hanged on the 29 April 1857, and John Chisley hanged on the 30 April 1857.\n\nAfter his death Price has, in Hughes' opinion \"remained one of the durable ogres of the Australian imagination\", featuring in Price Warung's tales and as the basis for the cruel commandant Maurice Frere in Marcus Clarke's \"For the Term of his Natural Life\" (1885). Hazzard calls him \"a rock of a man against whom some might lean with confidence; others he might crush without pity\", while his biographer concludes that \"he was a man of great personal strength and considerable courage, and was capable of sentimental as well as merciless deeds\".\n\nPrice is also featured as the villain in T.S Flynn's historical novel \"Part an Irishman The Regiment\"\n\n"}

Roberts is the anchor of ABC's \"Good Morning America\".\n\nAfter growing up in Mississippi and attending Southeastern Louisiana University, Roberts was a sports anchor for local TV and radio stations. Roberts was a sportscaster on ESPN for 15 years (1990–2005). She became co-anchor on \"Good Morning America\" in 2005. Roberts was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2012. Her treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome was chronicled on the program, which earned a 2012 Peabody Award for the coverage.\n\nThough born in Tuskegee, Alabama, Roberts grew up in Pass Christian, Mississippi, where she played basketball and tennis, among other sports. She attended Pass Christian High School and graduated as the class of 1979 salutatorian. She is the daughter of Lucimarian (née Tolliver) and Colonel Lawrence E. Roberts.\n\nIn a 2006 presentation to the assembled student body at Abilene Christian University, Roberts credited her parents as cultivating the \"three 'D's: Discipline, Determination, and 'De Lord'.\" She is the youngest of four, following siblings Sally-Ann, Lawrence, Jr. (nicknamed Butch), and Dorothy. Her father was a pilot with the Tuskegee Airmen.\n\nRoberts attended Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond, Louisiana, graduating \"cum laude\" in 1983 with a degree in communication. She followed in the footsteps of her older sister Sally-Ann Roberts, an anchor at the CBS affiliate WWL-TV in New Orleans.\n\nRoberts noted on the January 14, 2007, edition of \"Costas on the Radio\" that she was offered a scholarship to play basketball at Louisiana State University but thought the school was too big and impersonal after visiting the campus. On her way back to Pass Christian from that visit, she saw a road sign for Southeastern Louisiana University, stopped to visit and decided to enroll. The only scholarship left was a tennis scholarship, and she was promised that there would be a journalism scholarship by the time she would graduate. She went on to become a standout performer on the women's basketball team, ending her career as the school's third all-time leading scorer (1,446 points) and rebounder (1,034). Roberts is one of only three Lady Lions to score 1,000 career points and grab 1,000 career rebounds. During her senior season, she averaged a career-high 27.6 points per game. On February 5, 2011, Southeastern hosted a ceremony to retire Roberts's jersey, number 21.\n\nRoberts began her career in 1983 as a sports anchor and reporter for WDAM-TV in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. In 1984, she moved to WLOX-TV in Biloxi, Mississippi. In 1986, she was sports anchor and reporter for WSMV-TV in Nashville, Tennessee. She was also a sports anchor and reporter at WAGA-TV in Atlanta, Georgia, from 1988 to 1990. She was also a radio host for radio station V-103 while in Atlanta.\n\nShe joined ESPN as a sportscaster in February 1990, where she stayed until 2005. On \"SportsCenter\", she used the catchphrase, \"Go on with your bad self!\" Roberts began to work for ABC News, specifically as a featured reporter for \"Good Morning America\" in June 1995. In 2001, Roberts received the Mel Greenberg Media Award, presented by the WBCA.\n\nRoberts worked at both ESPN and \"Good Morning America\", contributing to both programs. During that time, she served primarily as the news anchor at \"GMA\". In 2005, Roberts was promoted to co-anchor of \"Good Morning America\". In December 2009, Roberts was joined by George Stephanopoulos as co-anchor of \"GMA\" after Diane Sawyer left to anchor \"ABC World News\". Under their partnership, the Roberts-Stephanopoulos team led \"Good Morning America\" back to the top of the ratings; the program became the number-one morning show again in April 2012, beating NBC's \"Today\", which had held the top spot for the previous 16 years. \n\nIn February, 2019, Roberts was highly sympathetic in the Jussie Smollett hoax, which cast doubts about her judgment and credibility. Smollett had been arrested on felony charges of disorderly conduct and filing a false police report, but rather than question him about the attack and his reaction to the many doubters in an interview, she failed to press him further on its suspicious details. Fox News host Tucker Carlson said Roberts \"colluded\" with Smollett to convince people that he was attacked by two men in Chicago who shouted homophobic and racist slurs. \"I don't know what the evidence is either, but I know a B.S. story when I see one,\" said Carlson, who added, \"I mean, Robin Roberts on ABC colluded with this guy to perpetuate his hoax. Other channels, the dishonest ones we compete against, are not even covering this development, apparently.\"\n\nRoberts is also known for infamous interviews with Chris Brown and Nate Parker. In March, 2011, while promoting his album \"F.A.M.E.\", Chris Brown was interviewed by Roberts. Throughout the interview Roberts frequently asked Brown about his relationship with singer Rihanna. When Brown tried speaking about his album, Roberts continued to press him about their relationship even though the subject obviously wanted no part of the conversation. In November, 2016, Nate Parker was interviewed by Roberts to promote his film \"Birth Of a Nation\". Roberts asked questions about his 1999 rape case even though Parker had been acquitted of the charge. Roberts went to far as to ask if he wanted to apologize for a crime that he did not commit.\n\nIn the fall of 2005, Roberts anchored a series of emotional reports from the Mississippi Gulf Coast after it was devastated by Hurricane Katrina; her hometown of Pass Christian was especially hard hit, with her old high school reduced to rubble. On February 22, 2009, Roberts hosted the Academy Awards preshow for ABC, and did so again in 2011. In 2010, Roberts guest starred on Disney Channel's \"Hannah Montana\", appearing in season 4, episode 10, \"Can You See the Real Me?\" On May 30, 2010, Roberts drove the Pace Car for the 2010 Indianapolis 500.\n\nRoberts was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame as part of the Hall's class of 2012 for her contributions to and impact on the game of women's basketball through her broadcasting work and play. In 2014 Roberts was named one of ESPNW's Impact 25.\nIn 2014, Roberts won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism. Roberts was inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2016.\n\nShe is the 2018 Radio Television Digital News Foundation's Lifetime Achievement Award recipient.\n\nOn May 19, 2018, Roberts co-anchored the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the American television star, at St. George's Chapel in Windsor.\n\nRoberts is Presbyterian and a practitioner of Transcendental Meditation. In 2007, Roberts was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer. She underwent surgery on August 3, and by January 2008 had completed eight chemotherapy treatments, followed by 6½ weeks of radiation treatment.\n\nIn 2012, she was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a disease of the bone marrow. Be the Match Registry, a nonprofit organization run by the National Marrow Donor Program, experienced an 1,800 percent spike in donors the day Roberts went public with her illness. She took a leave from \"GMA\" to get a bone marrow transplant, and went home in October 2012. She returned to \"GMA\" on February 20, 2013. Roberts received a 2012 Peabody Award for the program. The Peabody citation credits her for \"allowing her network to document and build a public service campaign around her battle with rare disease\" and \"inspir[ing] hundreds of potential bone marrow donors to register and heighten[ing] awareness of the need for even more donors.\" ESPN awarded its Arthur Ashe Courage Award to Roberts at the 2013 ESPYs, and the National Basketball Association awarded her the Sager Strong Award at its award ceremony on June 20, 2019.\n\nRoberts began a romantic relationship with massage therapist Amber Laign in 2005. Though friends and co-workers had known about her same-sex relationships, Roberts publicly acknowledged her sexual orientation for the first time in late December 2013. In 2015, she was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the 2015 LGBT History Month.\n\nOn October 10, 2018, Roberts was selected as a mentor for Disney's #DreamBigPrincess campaign.\n\nFor their first match of March 2019, the women of the United States women's national soccer team each wore a jersey with the name of a woman they were honoring on the back; Alyssa Naeher chose the name of Roberts.\n\nIn 2015, Roberts was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter, the tenth person to be given this award.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2070845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070845", "title": "Hi-top fade", "text": "Hi-top fade\n\nHi-top fade is a hairstyle or male haircut where hair on the sides is cut off or kept very short while hair on the top of the head is very long.\n\nThe hi-top was a trend symbolising the golden age of hip hop and urban contemporary music during the 1980s and the early 1990s. It was common among young black people between 1986 and 1992 and to a lesser extent in the mid–1990s (1993–1996).\n\nThe hi-top fade is commonly called a Crew cut, due to the great likeness of the two styles. In fact, the hi-top fade could qualify as a variation on the Flattop.\nIn 1980 Grace Jones and then boyfriend Jean-Paul Goude collaborated on the cover and artwork for \"Warm Leatherette\". It featured her signature flattop/hi-top hair.\n\nIn the hip hop community throughout the mid-1980s, young African Americans leaned towards Jheri curls or simple haircuts without tapers or fades of any sort. In 1986, rappers like Schoolly D and Doug E. Fresh had the first, somewhat developed, styles of the hi-top fade in hip hop. However, their hairstyles lacked the geometric precision that characterized the more modern hi-top fade styles.\n\nIn the hip-hop community, one of the first public appearances of the more modern hi-top fade hairstyles was in the \"Tramp\" video by Salt-N-Pepa, released early in 1987. In this video, the dancers could be seen with this hairstyle. They can be also seen dancing in a new jack swing style form based on their wardrobe and choreography, which was not seen in other hip hop and R&B videos at the time.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1980s the haircut was often credited to Larry Blackmon the lead singer of the band Cameo. Blackmon had a hairstyle in the mid 1980s that was the forerunner to the hi-top Fade, with the tall square flat top but with slightly longer sides and back. There are numerous examples of rappers referring to the hairstyle as a \"cameo cut\" between 1987 and 1990, the most notable being in the Ultramagnetic MCs song \"Give The Drummer Some\" from 1988 where Ced Gee, who had a hi-top fade at the time, says \"... 'cause I'm a real pro, with a cameo, and not an afro\".\n\nBy 1986, many young African American people, especially in the New York City, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia areas, began to follow the hi-top fade trend. At this time, hi-top fades became more geometrically defined, becoming more massive and 'higher' along with differences in shape as well as more designs. More music videos released from the fall of 1987 to the spring of 1988, such as \"I Don't Care\" by Audio Two (1988),\"2 Hype\" by Kid 'N Play (1988), \"Move the Crowd\" by Eric B. & Rakim (1987) (a few extras could be seen wearing one), \"Paper Thin\" by MC Lyte (1988), \"Rising to the Top\" by Doug E. Fresh (1988), \"Do This My Way\" by Kid 'N Play (1988), and \"Ain't No Half Steppin'\" by Big Daddy Kane (1988), shows examples of early trends of the more developed hi-top fade. In EPMD's \"You Gots To Chill\" several dancers and the DJ can be seen sporting Hi top fades in the music video.\n\nDifferent substyles emerged around the same time such as the \"gumby\" (slanted hi-top that had a shape similar to the Gumby cartoon character) or \"reagan\" (similar to the gumby but with more 'parts' and designs). Many of the teenage castmembers on the films \"Lean On Me\" (1989) with Morgan Freeman and Spike Lee's \"Do The Right Thing\" (1989) could be seen wearing these Gumby-shaped hairstyles. Recording artists such as Bobby Brown, TKA and Coro also wore the hi-top fade.\n\nFrom late 1988 to 1989, the hi-top fade was the symbol of the rap culture at the time. Rappers such as Kid 'N Play, Big Daddy Kane and Kwamé were internationally famous for helping promote this trend worldwide, particularly Kid 'N Play member Christopher \"Kid\" Reid. In late 1988, hi-top fades even became more developed, more hip-hoppers and people outside the New York area began following this trend. This hairstyle also helped define the new jack swing movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The video \"Fight the Power\" by Public Enemy, which was shot in April 1989, shows how much the trend set across the world and was highly symbolic of urban style at the time. Rapper and actor Will Smith sported a hi-top fade during the production of the popular sitcom \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\", even referencing the hairstyle in a first season episode of the show.\n\nThe conventional hi-top began to fall out of fashion in the early 1990s and was changed by revolutionary RnB groups like Jodeci, who added slits and unique designs that are still imitated till this day. This style became the staple design set by the group who were the self-imposed \"bad boys of RnB\". The turning point was between 1995 and 1997 many people who had sported the hi-top fade started to move toward other men's styles.\n\nStill, the hi-top remained common among many groups of young adults and teenagers for a few years longer. As for the braided style of hi-top fades, it characterized an era of 'afrocentricity' of hip hop and embracing the rap culture. Golden age MCs like Def Jef and the hip hop group De La Soul are known for their braided hi-top fade styles in 1989 and 1990. Many back-up dancers in many hip hop, dance, and R&B videos could be seen wearing similar hairstyles from 1990 to 1992. This trend continued until 1994 when urban hair style simplified into low-cut fade hair cuts and cornrow hairstyles. This hairstyle was also a fashion trend of new jack swing era.\n\nThe style began to slowly reemerge in popularity in the early to late 2000s, as a new generation of black musicians, athletes, and actors began to embrace this hairstyle. A prominent example is former Cleveland Cavaliers guard/forward Iman Shumpert. The hairstyle even surfaced again in 2012 with the late 1980s–early 1990s style returning. NBA players such as Nerlens Noel, and Norris Cole have sported hi-top fades.\n\nThe hi-top has made an appearance in the UK since the late 1980s. The hairstyle also received some airtime during the second inauguration of Barack Obama, as sported by Barack and Michelle Obama's nephew Avery Robinson.\n\n\n"}

The program features general national and international news stories, financial and entertainment news, off-beat stories, national weather forecasts and sports highlights. , it is anchored by Frances Rivera and Phillip Mena.\n\n\"Early Today\" is the only early morning network newscast on any of the three largest U.S. television networks (NBC, ABC or CBS) that is not produced jointly with an overnight news program (NBC has not aired an overnight newscast since the 1998 cancellation of \"NBC Nightside,\" which aired alongside \"Early Today\" during the latter program's first few months).\n\nAs of 2019, the program broadcasts three unique half hour shows at 3:00, 3:30 and 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time and is then tape delayed in a continuous half-hour loop until 8:00 a.m. Eastern (the show produces an additional half hour live at 6:30 a.m). Subsequently on September 11, NBC discontinued same-date reruns of CNBC's \"Mad Money\" from its late night schedule in order to accommodate the earlier live broadcast (before that date, \"Early Today\" was first broadcast live at 4:00 a.m. ET). As a result, some NBC affiliates that did not choose to fill the time period formerly occupied by the \"Mad Money\" replays with syndicated programs or infomercials following the change now air \"Early Today\" in the form of two separate editions or as a 90-minute to 2½-hour loop – in which case, the program competes against ABC's \"World News Now\" and the \"CBS Overnight News\", effectively resulting in \"Early Today\" acting as NBC's de facto overnight network newscast.\n\nIt usually airs as a lead-in to local morning newscasts on most NBC stations, although in the few markets where a morning newscast is not produced by the station, it may air in a two- to three-hour loop immediately before the start of \"Today\". The show may updated for any breaking news occurring before 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time, after which time any live breaking news requiring network-level coverage, at the station's local discretion in each time zone or network orders for live coverage, is under the oversight of \"Today\". \"Early Today\" and \"First Look\" are traditionally pre-empted during the Summer and Winter Olympic Games to allow the airing of overnight replays of NBC's primetime Olympic event coverage and live coverage on the NBC broadcast network and MSNBC, along with allowing stations to fulfill syndicated programming requirements where a distributor requires their programs to still air in some form with the open slot, albeit during the overnights.\n\n\"Early Today\" premiered on September 9, 1999 as a replacement for \"NBC News at Sunrise\", which NBC decided to cancel in April 1999 as part of a major shakeup of the network's daytime and early morning schedules (these changes included the launch of another \"Today\"-branded program, the short-lived talk show \"Later Today\", as well as the cancellation of the long-running soap opera \"Another World\"). The \"Early Today\" title had previously been used for another early morning news program produced by NBC News from 1982 to 1983 (and was replaced by \"NBC News at Sunrise\" following its cancellation), which featured the hosts of NBC's \"Today\" at the time – Jane Pauley, Bryant Gumbel and Willard Scott.\n\nOriginally produced from the former Fort Lee, New Jersey facilities of NBC's sister financial news cable network, CNBC, and focusing on business and financial news (including a modified version of the CNBC Ticker that showed stock prices and weather forecasts for select U.S. cities), the program switched to a general news format in 2004. As part of this reformatting, production of the program was relocated to the Secaucus headquarters of MSNBC. Concurrently, former \"Saturday Today\" anchor Amy Robach replaced the program's original anchor Nanette Hansen.\n\nMSNBC's \"First Look\", which airs at 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time, is a repurposed version of the network newscast using the weathercasters and segments. Until 2013, the sports segment was produced from the Los Angeles studios of NBC owned-and-operated station KNBC, using either Fred Roggin or Mario Solis as anchors; the segment was recorded after that station's 11:00 p.m. Pacific Time newscast for later airing and to account for most West Coast sports results, but was aired without any differences on both \"First Look\" and \"Early Today\" (the segment is now conducted live-to-tape during both programs from the newsroom at NBC Studios). Some segments seen on \"Early Today\" are excluded from \"First Look\", mainly the local weather cut-in (which does not appear at all on many NBC stations that broadcast \"Early Today\", showing only a list of forecasts for seven randomly selected U.S. cities) and a local event barker featuring a promotion for an NBC affiliate serving the city where the event is being held (which was dropped from the NBC program in 2013), while a small number of stories seen on \"Early Today\" may not be seen on \"First Look\".\n\nSome NBC affiliates do not air the entire program, and a purposeful sign-off is made by the show's anchor at the 24-minute mark in order to allow stations to air an early weather segment or start their morning newscast early, while NBC carries a non-essential human interest or light news story to end the telecast for stations that carry the entire program. Since NBC's corporate parent NBCUniversal acquired part-ownership of The Weather Channel in 2008, weather forecasts used on the program incorporate the channel's branding and forecasts, although \"Early Today\" uses repurposed graphics systems from the defunct digital multicast weather network NBC Weather Plus, which provided forecasts for the program until it shut down in 2008.\n\nIn September 2007, the program, as with the rest of MSNBC's operations, moved from the previous Secaucus, New Jersey headquarters to the network's combined news headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in the New York City borough of Manhattan, with MSNBC, in October 2007. MSNBC's master control facilities were relocated to the CNBC Headquarters at the NBC Universal Network Organization Center in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Until a revamp of the set used for both programs in 2011, the anchor background on \"Early Today\" was a video screen of a sunrise scene; a skycam shot of Manhattan was used for \"First Look\".\n\nOn June 29, 2009, concurrent with the launch of MSNBC's high definition simulcast feed, \"Early Today\" became the first early morning network newscast to begin broadcasting in high definition.\n\nThe program had aired live at 4:30 a.m. Eastern Time until March 1, 2010, when the initial broadcast of the show was moved to 4:00 a.m. Eastern to allow stations in the Eastern Time Zone to begin their morning newscasts at 4:30 a.m. with an \"Early Today\" lead-out; previously without the new schedule in some cases, the \"NBC All Night\" repeat of \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" would inexplicably lead into local news with five minutes cut off the former program if the default NBC schedule, in addition to one local half-hour program, was followed by an affiliate in the overnight hours. As of 2019, the show is now offered live as early as 3:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nFurther brand integration with \"Today\" came in December 2013, when \"Early Today\" introduced a new graphics package based on that used by the network's flagship morning show since August of that year, as well as a modified version of that program's \"orange sunrise\" logo.\n\n\"Early Today\" is the only American early morning network newscast that features both an on-staff meteorologist and sports anchor; anchors of ABC's \"America This Morning\" act as weather presenters, and staff from ABC's sister cable network ESPN present sports. The anchor of the CBS Morning News presents both weather and sports.\n\n\n\n\nMSNBC and NBC News programming, including \"Early Today\" and several other shows, is shown for several hours a day on the 24-hour news channel OSN News in the Middle East & Northern Africa region.\n\n\n"}

The town was founded in 1852.\n\nIt is a small village consisting of fourteen streets, lying in the middle of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range, in the northeast of Mexico. In the area near Rayones are the municipalities of Galeana (due south), Santiago (due north), and the state of Coahuila, due west. Rayones marks the beginning of the Zona Ixtlera, the southernmost region of the state of Nuevo León.\n\nAccess to Rayones is difficult. The main highway, coming from Montemorelos, is a challenge for most drivers. The unpaved highway coming from Galeana is even more risky, as it is a two-way road where only one vehicle fits; it is rocky, lined by a dangerous cliff and has no guard rail.\n\nRayones, however, is a touristic delight for offroad enthusiasts who travel long distances from the state's capital, Monterrey, crossing the Pilón river, the town's primary water source. Several lodging places surround the town, and the local hotel accommodates the convoys. The municipality has some interesting landmarks such as La Cebolla (the Onion), a hilltop with a pleasurable scenic overview.\n\nExtensive pecan tree plantations in the region bring prosperity to Rayones; pecans being the main product commercialized by locals. The traditional 'Feria de la Nuez' or \"Pecan Fair\" is held annually as a tourist attraction and a merchant exchange, with traditional dances and exhibitions also offered.\n"}

The copies were provided by the British reporter, who said he had destroyed the original documents to protect his sources. An anonymous senior British official said the documents appeared authentic.\n\nAP reported that the memos show: \"When Prime Minister Tony Blair's chief foreign policy adviser dined with Condoleezza Rice six months after the 11 September attacks, the then-US national security adviser didn't want to discuss Osama bin Laden or al-Qaida. She wanted to talk about 'regime change' in Iraq, setting the stage for the U.S.-led invasion more than a year later.\"\n\nBritish Foreign Office political director Peter Ricketts said in one of the memos. \"For Iraq, 'regime change' does not stack up. It sounds like a grudge between Bush and Saddam,\" Ricketts said. (See April 1993 for Saddam's attempted assassination of Bush's father.)\n\nThe memos express concern about breaking international law, but Blair is shown as being determined to go to war as Bush's ally regardless.\n\nTony Dodge, an Iraq expert at the University of London, said, \"The documents show what official inquiries in Britain already have, that the case of weapons of mass destruction was based on thin intelligence and was used to inflate the evidence to the level of mendacity. In going to war with Bush, Blair defended the special relationship between the two countries, like other British leaders have. But he knew he was taking a huge political risk at home. He knew the war's legality was questionable and its unpopularity was never in doubt.\" Dodge also said the memos show that Blair was aware that postwar instability in Iraq was likely.\n\nIn one of the memos, David Manning, who was Blair's chief foreign policy adviser, reported on a meeting in Washington, D.C., with Rice;\n\nIt is clear that Bush is grateful for your [Blair's] support and has registered that you are getting flak. I said that you would not budge in your support for regime change but you had to manage a press, a Parliament and a public opinion that was very different from anything in the States. And you would not budge either in your insistence that, if we pursued regime change, it must be very carefully done and produce the right result. Failure was not an option.\n\nI told Condi that we realized that the [Bush] administration could go it alone ... But if it wanted company, it would have to take account of its potential coalition partners. In particular:\n\nThe UN dimension. The issue of the weapons inspectors must be handled in a way that would persuade European and wider opinion that the U.S. was conscious of the international framework, and the insistence of many countries on the need for a legal base. Renewed refusal by Saddam to accept unfettered inspections would be a powerful argument.\n\nAfter a lunch with Paul Wolfowitz, Sir Christopher Meyer wrote a private letter to Manning:\nOn Iraq I opened by sticking very closely to the script that you used with Condi Rice last week. We backed regime change, but the plan had to be clever and failure was not an option... The US could go it alone if it wanted to. But if it wanted to act with partners, there had to be a strategy for building support for military action against Saddam. I then went through the need to wrongfoot Saddam on the inspectors and the UN security council resolutions and the critical importance of the Middle East peace plan.\n\nA 22 March memo from Ricketts to Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said,\n\nBut even the best survey of Iraq's WMD programmes will not show much advance in recent years on the nuclear, missile or CW/BW (chemical or biological weapons) fronts: the programmes are extremely worrying but have not, as far as we know, been stepped up.\n\nU.S. scrambling to establish a link between Iraq and al-Qaida is so far frankly unconvincing. To get public and Parliamentary support for military action, we have to be convincing that: the threat is so serious/imminent that it is worth sending our troops to die for; it is qualitatively different from the threat posed by other proliferators who are closer to achieving nuclear capability (including Iran).\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2070921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070921", "title": "Modern Arnis", "text": "Modern Arnis\n\nModern Arnis is the system of Filipino fighting arts founded by Remy Presas as a self-defense system. His goal was to create an injury-free training method as well as an effective self-defense system in order to preserve the older Arnis systems. The term \"Modern Arnis\" was used by Remy Presas' younger brother Ernesto Presas to describe his style of Filipino martial arts; since 1999 Ernesto Presas has called his system Kombatan. It is derived principally from the traditional Presas family style of the Bolo (machete) and the stick-dueling art of Balintawak Eskrima, with influences from other Filipino and Japanese martial arts.\n\nArnis is the Philippines' national martial art and sport, after President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed the Republic Act. No. 9850 in 2009. RA 9850 is a consolidation of House Bill No. 6516 authored by South Cotabato Rep. Arthur Pingoy Jr., and Senate Bill No. 1424 authored by Majority leader Juan Miguel Zubiri with the help of Richard Gialogo. RA 9850 is expected to help propagate arnis as a modern martial art/sport that can compete with popular non-Filipino arts, i.e. taekwondo, karate and judo. The Act mandates the Department of Education to include the sport as a Physical Education course.\n\nRemy Presas studied his family's system from an early age. He went on to study the Japanese systems of Shotokan Karate and Judo, achieving high rank in each; but he simultaneously studied a variety of other Filipino systems, most notably Venancio Bacon's Balintawak. Beginning with a small gymnasium in Bacolod in the 1950s, he attempted to spread the art to the local youth as both a cultural legacy and a form of physical development or sport. He taught the art at the University of Negros Occidental-Recoletos. His desire to reinvigorate interest in his country's traditional martial art grew over time, and he began making modifications and improvements to what he had learned. In 1969 he moved to Manila at the request of a government official, and formed the Modern Arnis Federation of the Philippines. He was assisted by individuals such as those who now are on the Modern Arnis Senior Masters Council: Rodel Dagooc, Jerry dela Cruz, Roland Dantes, Vicente Sanchez, Rene Tongson, and Cristino Vasquez. He continued to develop and spread his art, including via books, until political considerations forced him to relocate to North America.\n\nThere he met Wally Jay, George Dillman, and other artists who influenced his development of the art of Modern Arnis. In particular, many locks from Small Circle Jujitsu were added to Modern Arnis. The art continued to grow and change, in technique and in emphasis, though it always retained a focus on the single stick and on general self-defense. Those who trained with Remy Presas in the United States in the 1970s and early 1980s experienced the art differently from those who began training in the late 1990s. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he traveled extensively for seminars – the principal form of instruction in the system was through weekend training camps held around the world but especially in the U.S. – and produced books and videos. \nDuring the 1990s Wally Jay, Remy Presas (Modern Arnis), and Jack Hogan (Kyusho Jitsu) traveled together throughout the United States and worldwide promulgating small-circle jujitsu. At that time many elements of Small Circle JuJitsu were well integrated into Modern Arnis.\n\nDuring this time he experimented with different forms of titles and leadership in the art. The International Modern Arnis Federation Philippines would come to be the lead Modern Arnis organization in the Philippines, and the Deutscher Arnis Verband of Germany would be the lead organization in Europe. In the United States, the International Modern Arnis Federation (IMAF) was the principal organization as far as certification was concerned, but the founder created a variety of titles that indicated some level of organizational or leadership authority in the art (as opposed to titles such as \"guro\" (\"teacher\") or \"Punong Guro\" (\"Head teacher\") that recognized teaching and/or technical ability). Most prominent among these titles were \"Datu\", meaning a chieftain or leader, awarded in this order to Shishir Inocalla, Kelly Worden and Ric \"Bong\" Jornales (of Arnis Sikaran) (all in the 1980s), Dieter Knuettel (1996), Tim Hartman and David Hoffman (both in 2000); and Master of Tapi-Tapi, awarded to Jeff Delaney, Chuck Gauss, Jim Ladis, Gaby Roloff, Randi Schea, Ken Smith, and Brian Zawilinski. The Masters of Tapi-Tapi titles were created to provide leadership and steerage for the IMAF following Remy Presas' passing; the Datus were expected to take leadership roles that might see them move in different, and perhaps less conventional, directions. Through 2001, however, the art remained largely united under the founder.\n\nIn the wake of the 2001 death of Remy Presas, there was a splintering of the remaining leadership of Modern Arnis. The IMAF, the organization of record for North American Modern Arnis practitioners, split into two subgroups, one headed by Randi Schea and one headed by Jeff Delaney; the remaining five Masters of Tapi-Tapi associated with the group led by Randi Schea. Remy Presas' son Remy P. Presas and his siblings formed a group following his father's death, and Tim Hartman and Dieter Knuettel increased the independence of their organizations (the WMAA and DAV, respectively). Other groups, such as that headed by Kelly Worden, had become independent well before the founder's death (and with his support). Dan Anderson formed another branch of the art which he calls \"MA80 System Arnis/Eskrima\" which adds influences from Balintawak Eskrima and Integrated Eskrima. In 2012 Randi Schea and Jim Ladis retired from the IMAF. In 2018, Brian Zawilinski, the senior-most Master of Tapi Tapi, resigned from the IMAF and operates independently worldwide. \n\nIn many ways, the situation is analogous to what occurred in the Jeet Kune Do and American Kenpo communities following the deaths of their popular and charismatic founders. In particular, the question of how high-ranking \"arnisadors\" should test for higher rank has been settled by different organizations in different ways. In some cases this has caused controversy. The art is healthy and continues to attract students.\n\nCurrent practitioners of Modern Arnis or arts strongly influenced by Modern Arnis who are prominent include: Bambit Dulay, Rene Tongson, Tim Hartman, Chuck Gauss, Ken Smith, Brian Zawilinski, Dan Anderson, Bram Frank, Kelly Worden, Rodel Dagooc and Dieter Knuettel. Modern Arnis continues to be taught worldwide.\n\nOne of the characteristics of Filipino martial arts is the use of weapons from the very beginning of training and Modern Arnis is no exception. The primary weapon is the rattan stick, called a cane or \"baston\" (baton), which varies in size, but is usually about 28 inches (71 cm) in length. Both single and double stick techniques are taught, with an emphasis on the former; unarmed defenses against the stick and against bladed weapons (which the stick is sometimes taken to represent) are a part of the curriculum.\n\nIt is said that, originally, the cane was considered sacred by practitioners (Arnisadores), and therefore an arnis practitioner was expected to hit his cane at the hand or forearm of his sparring partner and not at the latter's cane. This had the advantage of being the preferred method in actual combat, referred to as \"defanging the snake\", that is, making the opponent drop his weapon so that he is less of a threat. However, it discouraged many would-be practitioners who found this training too painful and injury-inducing. The result was that the Filipino martial arts became in danger of dying out; in most areas of the Philippines, Japanese martial arts such as Karate and Judo were much more popular than the indigenous systems. Remy Presas' modernization of the training method was intended to help preserve the Filipino martial arts. He taught the method of hitting cane-on-cane during practice, which attracted more newcomers to the art and allowed the art to be taught in the Philippines' school system. \"Defanging the snake\" remains a principle of Modern Arnis, however, and in practical application, one would typically strike the hand or arm. The technique can be used empty-handed, where it is known as \"limb destruction\".\n\nTraining covers empty-hand self-defense (striking, locking, throwing, etc.) as well as the trademark single and double stick techniques of the Filipino martial arts. Other aspects of the art include \"espada y daga\" (sword and dagger fighting), \"sinawali\" (double stick weaving patterns), and \"tapi-tapi\" (locking drills with the stick). In addition to partner drills, Modern Arnis includes the use of \"anyo\" (kata), solo forms both with and without the stick. Emphasis is placed on fitting the art in with a student's previous training (\"the art within your art\"), smoothly reacting to changing situations in the fight (\"the flow\"), and countering the opponent's attempt to counter strikes directed at him (\"tapi-tapi\"). Practitioners are called \"arnisadors\" or Modern Arnis players.\n\nIn addition to its Filipino influences, elements of Judo, Shotokan Karate, and Wally Jay's Small Circle Jujutsu appear in the system.\n\nModern Arnis uses a ranking system similar to the Dan ranks used in Karate and other Japanese systems. There are some minor variations between organizations as to the exact number of belts. There are 10 or 11 black belt ranks in Modern Arnis, depending on the organization. They are numbered in Tagalog:\n\n\nMany groups use a \"zero-degree\" black belt rank as a probationary stage that comes before \"Isa\". The actual name of the ranks is gender-specific. For men the rank is referred to as \"Lakan\" (Tagalog for nobleman) while for women it is referred to as \"Dayang\" (Tagalog for lady). Thus, a first degree black belt in Modern Arnis would be referred to as either a \"Lakan Isa\" or a \"Dayang Isa\", depending on his or her gender. The \"zero-degree\" rank, if used, is referred to as simply \"Lakan\" or \"Dayang\". The black belt is traditionally bordered with red; however, some groups use a plain black belt.\n\nIn addition to rank, titles such as Datu, Commissioner, Master of Tapi-Tapi, Senior Master, \"Punong Guro\", etc., have occasionally been granted to certain high-ranking individuals. The title \"Guro\" is typically given to all \"Lakans\" and \"Dayangs\".\n\nModern Arnis is perpetuated worldwide and some of the countries where the art is most popular are the Philippines, the United States, Canada, and Germany, but there are practitioners in many other nations as well. There are numerous organizations that continue to spread the art of Modern Arnis, to include (in no particular order) IMAFP (Philippines), DAV (Germany), WMAA (New York state), IMAF (Illinois), CSSD/SC (Florida), MA-80 (Oregon), NSI (Washington State) and TAWA (Connecticut).\n\n\n"}

The group is sometimes called the simple thalloid liverworts: \"thalloid\" because the members lack structures resembling stems or leaves, and \"simple\" because their tissues are thin and relatively undifferentiated. All species in the order have a small gametophyte stage and a smaller, relatively short-lived, spore-bearing stage. Although these plants are almost entirely restricted to regions with high humidity or readily available moisture, the group as a whole is widely distributed, and occurs on every continent except Antarctica.\n\nMembers of the Metzgeriales typically are small and thin enough to be translucent, with most of the tissues only a single cell layer in thickness. Because these plants are thin and relatively undifferentiated, with little evidence of distinct tissues, the Metzgeriales are sometimes called the \"simple thalloid liverworts\".\nThere is considerable diversity in vegetative structure of the Metzgeriales. As a rule, simple thalloid liverworts do not have structures resembling leaves. However, a few genera, such as \"Fossombronia\", and \"Symphyogyna\", are \"semileafy\" and have a thallus that is very deeply lobed, thus giving the appearance of leafiness. The genus \"Phyllothallia\" has a more striking leafiness, with paired lobes of tissue spaced regularly at swollen nodes along a central, forked stem. The several semileafy groups within the Metzgeriales are not closely related to each other, and the currently accepted view is that the leafy condition evolved separately and independently in each of the groups where it occurs.\n\nMembers of the Metzgeriales also differ from the related Jungermanniales in the location of their archegonia (female reproductive structures). Whereas archegonia in the Jungermanniales develop directly from the apical cell at the tip of a fertile branch, archegonia in the Metzgeriales develop from a cell that is behind the apical cell. As a result, the female reproductive organs, and the sporophytes that develop within them, are always located on the dorsal surface of the plant. Because these structures do not develop at the apex of the branch, their development in the Metzgeriales is described as \"anacrogynous\", from Greek ἀν- (\"an-\", \"not\") + ἄκρος (\"akros\", \"tip\") + γυνή (\"gynē\", “female”). The group was accordingly known as the Anacrogynae prior to being recognized as a separate order.\n\nAlthough these plants are almost entirely restricted to regions with high humidity or readily available moisture, the group as a whole is widely distributed, and occurs on every continent except Antarctica.\n\nOne simple thalloid liverwort is not photosynthetic. The species \"Cryptothallus mirabilis\" is white as a result of lacking chlorophyll, and has plastids that do not differentiate into chloroplasts. This species is a myco-heterotroph that obtains its nutrients from fungi growing among its tissues. These plants grow in bogs and are typically found under peat moss near birch trees.\n\nThe beginning of modern liverwort nomenclature is marked with the 1753 publication of Linnaeus' \"Species Plantarum\", although this relied heavily upon the prior work of Micheli (1729) and Dillenius (1741). Linnaeus included all 25 known species of liverworts, together with mosses, algae, and fungi, within a single class Cryptogamia. Linnaeus' system was heavily revised by workers in the early nineteenth century, so that by the time Endlicher published his \"Enchiridion Botanicum\" in 1841, five orders of liverworts were defined, and the \"Frondosae\" were segregated as a group that is congruent with the modern concept of the Metzgeriales. Endlicher's \"Frondosae\" included five subgroups (Metzgerieae, Aneureae, Haplolaeneae, Diplomitrieae, and Codonieae) with no assigned taxonomic rank, but these groups were termed \"Familien\" by Dědeček in 1886. The same five subgroups of \"Frondosae\", without significant change, were used in the \"Synopsis Hepaticarum\" of Gottsche, Lindenberg, and Nees.\n\nA more thorough understanding of the Metzgeriales was not achieved until the morphological and developmental work of Leitgeb in the late nineteenth century. Leitgeb was among the first to recognize and appreciate the significance of development and reproductive morphology as a guide to distinguishing liverwort groups. His careful examinations guided revisions made in the classification published from 1893 to 1895 by Schiffner in Engler and Prantl. Schiffner thus divided his \"Jungermanniales\" into two broad groups according to whether the archegonia were terminal on reproductive branches (\"Jungermanniales akrogynae\") or sub-terminal (\"Jungermanniales anakrogynae\"). This latter group included what are now recognized as the Metzgeriales, Sphaerocarpales, and Haplomitriales.\n\nThe simple thalloids were not given ordinal status until 1930 by Chalaud. Although subsequent systems similarly treated the group as distinct, the name of the order was more often given as \"Jungermanniales anacrogynae\" (or similar), or the group was retained within the Jungermanniales as a suborder with either this name or the name \"Metzgerineae\". The highly influential and comprehensive 1966 classification found in Schuster's \"Hepaticae and Anthocerotae of North America\" firmly established the name \"Metzgeriales\" for the group, although he had used this name in his earlier works. Schuster revised his system in 1972 and again in 1984. The only change he made in the circumscription of the Metzgeriales was to remove the Treubiales in accordance with that change made in the classification of Schljakov.\n\nSchljakov's 1972 classification had elevated several subordinal groups within the simple thalloids to the rank of order, and treated the Metzgeriales itself as a superorder \"Metzgerianae\", but Schuster's 1984 system rejected most of these changes. The classification of Crandall-Stotler and Stotler (2000) adopted several of Schljakov's orders, while revising their membership and grouping them within a subclass \"Metzgeriidae\". These changes reflected a morphological analysis of species that had been presented three years earlier. Although their system changed the rank and the Latin ending of the name, the composition was identical to the Metzgeriales of Schuster (1966), with only the addition of the Haplomitriales to its membership. Subsequent studies incorporating DNA sequence analysis have removed the Haplomitriales, Treubiales, and Blasiales and place those taxa elsewhere. The remnant of the group, after the removal of these taxa, consists of their Metzgeriales (7 families), Fossombroniales (4 families), and the Phyllothalliaceae.\n\nThe Metzgeriales traditionally included fourteen families, as follows:\n\nFamilies marked with an asterisk were classified in the separate order Fossombroniales by Crandall-Stotler and Stotler, but this grouping is not supported by subsequent analysis using DNA sequences.\n\nTwo additional families were formerly included within the Metzgeriales, but since have been transferred to other classes of liverwort. The Blasiaceae has been assigned its own order Blasiales, and phylogenetic studies show that it is more closely related to the Marchantiales than to members of the Metzgeriales. Likewise, the Treubiaceae is now in its own order Treubiales, within the recently recognized class Haplomitriopsida.\n\nA 2016 analysis of liverwort classification has further reduced the Metzgeriales to include only two families, Metzgeriaceae and Aneuraceae, with all other previously included families dispersed into three additional orders: Fossombroniales, Pallaviciniales, and Pelliales.\n\nIn previous decades, there has been considerable confusion over the correct attribution of the name \"Metzgeriales\". The ordinal name Metzgeriales was first published by Chalaud in 1930 with the description “J’ai désigné très généralement les Jungermannniales anacrogynes sous le nom de Metzgériales,” (that is: \"I have designated very generally the \"Jungermannniales anacrogynes\" under the name of \"Metzgeriales\"\"). Chalaud cited Underwood 1894 in support of his treatment, but Underwood himself used only the name \"Metzgeriaceae\" for the group, and considered the whole to represent a single family. The publication of the ordinal name by Chalaud was accepted as correct by Grolle in his 1983 synopsis of the generic and higher-rank names of liverworts.\n\nWriting in 1984, Rudolf M. Schuster questioned the correct authority for the ordinal name. He believed that Underwood had first used the term, but concluded that as neither Underwood nor Chalaud had provided a formal description, the order should be cited as \"Metzgeriales Schust. emend. Schljak.\" He ascribed first use of the name with a description to his own 1953 work on the liverworts of Minnesota. This work included a considerable description sufficient to distinguish the order from all others, but Schuster relied on the 1972 emendation by Schljakov to provide the Latin diagnosis required by the \"International Code of Botanical Nomenclature\". Schuster reaffirmed his position on the authority for publication in 1992.\n\nIn the publication of their revised liverwort classification in 2000, Crandall-Stotler and Stotler agreed with Schuster as to the attribution of the name, although they restricted their circumscription of the order considerably. However, upon additional review of the Chalaud paper, they reversed their opinion. They concluded that Chalaud's diagnosis, although \"terse\", was nonetheless adequate to satisfy the requirements for publication of a botanical name, and that the \"Code\"'s requirement for a Latin diagnosis did not apply, since the Chalaud paper was published prior to 1 January 1935. Chalaud is therefore the correct authority in citing the name \"Metzgeriales\".\n\nThe Metzgeriales are a paraphyletic group of liverworts, in that they do not include all the descendants of their most recent common ancestor. Specifically, the Jungermanniales (leafy liverworts) are more closely related to the Aneuraceae and Metzgeriaceae than are other simple thalloid groups.\n\nBecause plants belonging to the Metgeriales lack hard tissues, and the plants often decay or die back, preservation of fossils is dependent upon rapid burial by floods or volcanic ash. Bryophytes are considered \"delicate\" plants, and this characteristic is often cited as the reason for the apparently poor fossil record of the group. However, fossils of the Metzgeriales are distributed widely, both geographically and stratigraphically, and the fossils which have been found are often highly detailed and well-preserved.\n\nThe oldest fossil bryophyte is a compression fossil of \"Pallavicinites devonicus\" from Upper Devonian rocks that has been confidently assigned to the Metzgeriales. Portions of the fossil that have been isolated for microscopic examination reveal an extraordinary degree of cellular detail. The plant consisted of a thin, ribbon-like, bifurcating thallus with a thicker central midrib. The plant is remarkably similar in structure to members of the extant liverwort family Pallaviciniaceae, but no reproductive structures have been found. Additional species assigned to the genus \"Pallavicinites\" have been found in rocks dating from the Carboniferous to the Pleistocene.\n\nAnother early fossil probably belonging to the Metzgeriales is the Carboniferous fossil \"Thallites willsi\", which has been compared to the modern genus \"Metzgeria\". However, it has been assigned to the form genus \"Thallites\", which is used for thalloid fossil plants and algae of uncertain relationships. Most fossils belonging to the Metzgeriales are assigned to the genus \"Metzgeriites\", which was established for this purpose. Specimens from the Upper Carboniferous of Shropshire, England, have been named \"Hepaticites metzgerioides\", and (as the specific epithet indicates) these specimens strongly resemble the genus \"Metzgeria\". However, they have been placed instead in the form genus \"Hepaticites\", used for fossils believed to be liverworts but without confident affiliation with any extant order. This species is not restricted to British localities, but has also been found in the Karagandy Province of Kazakhstan.\n\nMesozoic fossils of \"Metzgeriites\" have also been found. \"Metzgeriites glebosus\" has been collected from Jurassic strata of Greenland. The type material, and so far only material collected, consists of a midrib with a thin lamina that is deeply and irregularly lobed. A Cretaceous fossil from Portugal has been named \"Metzgeriites infracretaceus\". Like \"M. glebosus\", it possesses a midrib and thin lamina, but unlike that taxon the lamina of \"M. infracretaceus\" is not lobed.\n\n"}

Highway N194 forms the southern border of the commune and gives access to the town of Baleone. To access Afa from Ajaccio it is necessary to take the turn-off from Highway N194 to Highway D81 heading north to the intersection of Highway D161, which highway leads east into Afa village. Road D161 continues west through the canton to join Highway N193 forming an access road from the eastern side. There is also the D5 road giving access to Afa from \"Pratu Tondu\" in the east. The northern border is delineated by the peaks of the high mountain ranges to the north.\n\nThe commune lies on the southern slope of the Punta Pastinaca mountains, including Appietto at . The Rock of Gozzi, at , forms part of the northern border, \"riding\" on the two communes.\n\nThe commune territory is mostly flat from the foot of the steep Gozzi Rock. The highest point of the town is well watered with:\n\nThe Gravona Canal which supplies water to the town of Ajaccio, crosses the southern side of the commune, north of the industrial area of Baléone. At the entrance to Mezzavia on the southwestern border of the commune, an aqueduct spans the Verdana stream which is fed by the waters of Stagnolu and also crosses road D81 north of its junction with Highway NR194.\n\nThe commune of Afa (Affà in Corsican as shown on cadastral maps) consists of four hamlets: Piscia Rossa Pastriccialone, part of Baléone and Afa in the centre.\n\nAfa town is composed of a central core, the village, with many subdivisions around, the most important being Ogliastrone.\n\nThe Afa town hall was restored in 2004. In the city centre is a church that is about a hundred years old.\n\nGozzi Rock is visible from Afa.\n\n\"Piscia Rossa\" is north-west of the town, at the western foot of Monte Gozzi. Today, the village has spread out to the neighbouring commune of Appin.\n\n\"U Pastriccialone\" is a small hamlet north-east of the town, south-east of the Gozzi Rock. In the village is the parish church of St. Anthony of Padua.\n\nOnly the northern part of Baléone, which is an industrial area, belongs to the commune of Afa. It lies at the southern border of Afa.\n\nWeather Data for Afa\n\nIn the 16th century the current territory of Afa did not exist as it was a part of the Pieve of La Mezana, a Pieve with a population of about 650 inhabitants in 1520 and with villages called: \"Sarla\", \"Carcopino\", \"la Punta\", \"Londella\", \"lo Cazille\", \"lo Pogiale\", and Opapu.\n\nLa Mezana, later called the Pieve of Mezzana, was surrounded by:\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Afa continued in the Pieve Mezzana until 1789 when it became the canton of Sarrola-Carcopino.\n\nOriginally the village of Afa was a hamlet in the commune of Bocognano. In 1851 Afa became a municipality of the canton of Sarrola-Carcopino in the department of Corsica.\n\nThe commune of Afa was created through land abandonment by Sarrola-Carcopino and the Valle-di-Mezzana (\"I Vaddi di Mezana\"). The first mayor of Afa was called Carlo Calvelli and he was elected in 1852 and remained until his death in 1858 at the age of 48 years. The village was populated by shepherds from Bocognano during the migration of sheep to summer pastures. This explains the bocognanaise origin of old families in Afa. In summer, many Afaiens return to the village of Bocognano.\n\nThe creation of the commune was the result of a report by Pongérard during the session of the National Assembly of 25 July 1850 that created the commune of Afa.\n\nThe report read in part:\n\n\"Gentlemen, the communes of Valle-di-Mezzana and of Bocognano in the district of Ajaccio, Corsica department, have two portions of territory which not only have the status of enclaves, but the distance separating them from their respective communes is some Six Leagues. Since the two enclaves are contiguous and together have an area of 1.2 hectares with three groups of houses, and a population of about 350 souls, it seems appropriate to create a separate commune under the name of \"Affa\".\"\n\n\"The inhabitants of these enclaves join with their Municipal Councils to ask for the maintenance of the current state of affairs. Most of the principle Administrators and regulations of the land registry demand the removal of these enclaves. There must necessarily be a distinct old commune, or to join them as is proposed in the course of the instruction to the commune of Sarrola. The first of these remedial measures is obviously more advantageous to the people, at least in the opinion of the Administrative Authorities and the elected councillors of the arrondissement and of the department. They appeared certain that the establishment of an administrative centre in the middle of nomadic populations today, would change their habits and lead to improvement in their Agriculture and Industry. Also they would become a source of well-being and prosperity.\"\n\n\"Bocognano and Valle-Mezzana who, in all these cases, must lose the enclaved territories, not in keeping the \"Forte Une\" elements of the municipal organisation. Not that this operation is not important for Bocognano who has administered an enclave of 1100 hectares for a long time and which will almost entirely be within the proposed commune. They will have nevertheless a territorial area of over 5,000 hectares and a population of more than 2,000 inhabitants. About Valle-Mezzana, they will only give up 115 hectares which are uninhabited.\"\n\n\"The formation of the new commune of \"Affa\" will modify the district of the canton which Bocognano is in. The administrative authorities, such as the Minister of Justice, have, in effect, been advised that it should be attributed to the canton of Sarrola-Carcopino. Moreover Affa is not large enough, nor has enough people for the loss of its territory to the canton of Bocognano to be a significant loss.\"\n\n1954: The canton of Ajaccio is created with the communes of: \"Afa\", \"Ajaccio\", \"Alata\", \"Appin\", \"Bastelicaccia\", and \"Villanova\".\n\n1975: With the division of the island of Corsica into two departments, Afa passed into the department of Corse-du-Sud.\n\nList of Successive Mayors of Afa\n\nAfa has:\n\nThe nearest secondary school education is at Baléone (Sarrola-Carcopino), less than from the village, and the next nearest school is St. Paul's College High School in Ajaccio, within .\n\nThe town also has a pharmacy, a dentist, and a medical service staffed by nurses and doctors in a medical unit that has been present since about 2002.\n\nThe Afa Football Association (AFA) was formed of the merger between the USCA and the ARC on 18 June 1998 (220 members at its creation). To date, it is chaired by François Faggianelli who has held this position since June 2000.\n\nIn 2011 it had 400 members.\n\nThe village football club is the Afa Football Association, founded in 1998.\n\nThe war memorial is outside the City Hall, created by Noël Bonardi, a sculptor from Afa who has made statues everywhere in Corsica and whose studio is located in Afa.\n\n\n\n\n"}

While serving as a sailor during his adolescent years, de Benneville traveled around the world and began to question his religion and compare it to other world religions. He shed his Huguenot religion, developed his own ideas about Christianity, and became a preacher while still in his teens.\n\nDe Benneville had a mystical experience and later a near death experience which he described in \"The Life and Trance of Dr. George De Benneville\". These experiences convinced him that Hell is for purification, not punishment, and that, ultimately, all will be united with God. He believed that God is absolutely good and in his love would never condemn any human to eternal damnation. He also preached that each human being has a dualistic nature; the outer, flesh-and-blood person is subject to the evils of the world and may choose to do good or to do wrong, while the inner, spiritlike person is crafted by God and is perfect, immaculate, and holy, and cannot be damned.

{"id": "2070945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070945", "title": "Peter Matthiessen", "text": "Peter Matthiessen\n\nPeter Matthiessen (May 22, 1927 – April 5, 2014) was an American novelist, naturalist, wilderness writer, zen teacher and CIA officer. A co-founder of the literary magazine \"The Paris Review\", he was the only writer to have won the National Book Award in both fiction and nonfiction. He was also a prominent environmental activist. Matthiessen's nonfiction featured nature and travel, notably \"The Snow Leopard\" (1978) and American Indian issues and history, such as a detailed and controversial study of the Leonard Peltier case, \"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse\" (1983). His fiction was adapted for film: the early story \"Travelin' Man\" was made into \"The Young One\" (1960) by Luis Buñuel and the novel \"At Play in the Fields of the Lord\" (1965) into the 1991 film of the same name.\n\nIn 2008, at age 81, Matthiessen received the National Book Award for Fiction for \"Shadow Country\", a one-volume, 890-page revision of his three novels set in frontier Florida that had been published in the 1990s. According to critic Michael Dirda, \"No one writes more lyrically [than Matthiessen] about animals or describes more movingly the spiritual experience of mountaintops, savannas, and the sea.\"\n\nMatthiessen was treated for acute leukemia for more than a year. He died on April 5, 2014, three days before publication of his final book, the novel \"In Paradise\" on April 8.\n\nMatthiessen was born in New York City to Erard Adolph Matthiessen (1902-2000) and Elizabeth (née Carey). Erard, an architect, joined the Navy during World War II and helped design gunnery training devices. Later, he gave up architecture to become a spokesman and fundraiser for the Audubon Society and the Nature Conservancy. The well-to-do family lived in both New York City and Connecticut where, along with his brother, Matthiessen developed a love of animals that influenced his future work as a wildlife writer and naturalist. He attended St. Bernard's School, the Hotchkiss School, and — after briefly serving in the U.S. Navy (1945–47) – Yale University (B.A., 1950), with his junior year spent at the Sorbonne. At Yale, he majored in English, published short stories (one of which won the prestigious Atlantic Prize), and studied zoology. \n\nMarrying and resolving to undertake a writer's career, he soon moved back to Paris, where he associated with other expatriate American writers such as William Styron, James Baldwin and Irwin Shaw. There, in 1953, he became one of the founders, along with Harold L. Humes, Thomas Guinzburg, Donald Hall, and George Plimpton, of the literary magazine \"The Paris Review\". As revealed in a 2006 film, he was working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) at the time, using the \"Review\" as his cover. In a 2008 interview with Charlie Rose, Matthiessen stated that he \"invented \"The Paris Review\" as cover\" for his CIA activities. He completed his novel \"Partisans\" while employed by the CIA. He returned to the U.S. in 1954, leaving Plimpton (a childhood friend) in charge of the \"Review\". Matthiessen divorced in 1956 and began traveling extensively.\n\nIn 1959, Matthiessen published the first edition of \"Wildlife in America,\" a history of the extinction and endangerment of animal and bird species as a consequence of human settlement, throughout North American history, and of the human effort to protect endangered species.\n\nIn 1965, Matthiessen published \"At Play in the Fields of the Lord,\" a novel about a group of American missionaries and their encounter with a South American indigenous tribe. The book was adapted into the film of the same name in 1991. In 1968, he signed the \"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. His work on oceanographic research, \"Blue Meridian\", with photographer Peter A. Lake, documented the making of the film \"Blue Water, White Death\" (1971), directed by Peter Gimbel and Jim Lipscomb.\n\nLate in 1973 Matthiessen joined field biologist George Schaller on an expedition in the Himalaya Mountains, which was the basis for \"The Snow Leopard\" (1978), his double-award-winner. Interested in the Wounded Knee Incident and the 1976 trial and conviction of Leonard Peltier, an American Indian Movement activist, Matthiessen wrote a non-fiction account, \"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse\" (1983).\n\nIn 2008, Matthiessen revisited his trilogy of Florida novels published during the 1990s: \"Killing Mr. Watson\" (1990), \"Lost Man's River\" (1997) and \"Bone by Bone\" (1999), inspired by the frontier years of South Florida and the death of planter Edgar J. Watson shortly after the Southwest Florida Hurricane of 1910. He revised and edited the three books, which had originated as one 1,500-page manuscript, which eventually yielded the award-winning single-volume \"Shadow Country\".\n\nWhile Matthiessen is celebrated for his mastery of both fiction and non-fiction, he always considered himself first and foremost a writer of novels, saying, \"Like anything that one makes well with one's own hands, writing good nonfiction prose can be profoundly satisfying. Yet after a day of arranging my research, my set of facts, I feel stale and drained, whereas I am energized by fiction. Deep in a novel, one scarcely knows what may surface next, let alone where it comes from. In abandoning oneself to the free creation of something never beheld on earth, one feels almost delirious with a strange joy.\"\n\nShortly after the 1983 publication of \"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse\", Matthiessen and his publisher Viking Penguin were sued for libel by David Price, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, and William J. Janklow, the former South Dakota governor. The plaintiffs sought over $49 million in damages; Janklow also sued to have all copies of the book withdrawn from bookstores. \nAfter four years of litigation, Federal District Court Judge Diana E. Murphy dismissed Price's lawsuit, upholding Matthiessen's \"freedom to develop a thesis, conduct research in an effort to support the thesis, and to publish an entirely one-sided view of people and events.\" In the Janklow case, a South Dakota court also ruled for Matthiessen. Both cases were appealed. In 1990, the Supreme Court refused to hear Price's arguments, effectively ending his appeal. The South Dakota Supreme Court dismissed Janklow's case the same year. With the lawsuits concluded, the paperback edition of the book was finally published in 1992.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale in 1950, Matthiessen became engaged to Patsy Southgate, a Smith graduate whose father had been the chief of protocol in Roosevelt's White House. Matthiessen and Southgate had two children together. They divorced in 1956.\n\nIn 1963 he married the writer Deborah Love. In his book \"The Snow Leopard\", Matthiessen reported having had a somewhat tempestuous on-again off-again relationship with his wife Deborah, culminating in a deep commitment to each other made shortly before she was diagnosed with cancer. Matthiessen and Deborah practiced Zen Buddhism. She died in New York City near the end of 1972.\n\nIn September of the following year came the field trip to Himalayan Nepal. Matthiessen later became a Buddhist priest of the White Plum Asanga. He gave dharma transmission to three students: Sensei Madeline Ko-I Bastis, Sensei Michel Engu Dobbs, and Sensei Dorothy Dai-En Friedman. Before practicing Zen, Matthiessen was an early pioneer of LSD. He said his Buddhism evolved fairly naturally from his drug experiences. He argued that it was unfortunate that LSD had become outlawed over time, given its potentially beneficial effects as a spiritual and therapeutic tool (when administered with the right care and attention) and was critical of a figure such as Timothy Leary in terms of the long-term reputation of the drug.\n\nIn 1980, Matthiessen married Maria Eckhart, born in Tanzania, in a Zen ceremony on Long Island, New York. They lived in Sagaponack, New York. Eckhart is the mother of Serial host and Executive Producer Sarah Koenig, who was 10 or 11 years old at the time of the marriage.\n\nMatthiessen was diagnosed with leukemia in late 2012. He died at his home in Sagaponack on April 5, 2014, aged 86.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The state park lies south of the town of Big Pool, Maryland. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal runs through the park grounds. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973.\n\nFort Frederick was built in 1756-57 by the colony of Maryland. During the French and Indian War in 1756, a £6000 appropriation was authorized by the Maryland Legislature at the request of Governor Horatio Sharpe to build a fortification on the frontier. The fort, named after Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore, was completed the following year. The design of the fort conforms to the style developed early in the 18th century by Sebastien de Vauban, a French military engineer who is considered the father of modern fortification.\n\nThe large stone fort was designed primarily as a place of refuge for area settlers. Between 1757 and 1758, small raids by Indians in nearby settlements caused settlers in the surrounding countryside to flee eastward. At the same time men of the 60th Regiment of Foot and local militia soldiers garrisoned the fort. Ranging parties were sent from the fort to patrol the area and to deter if not prevent Indian raids.\n\nThe fort was not designed to resist artillery, as it was correctly assumed that the French would not be able to transport artillery to the remote location from the west. The fort served its purpose in 1763 during Pontiac's Rebellion; however, the fort was never directly attacked.\n\nThe fort was used as a prisoner of war camp from 1777 to 1783. As many as 1,000 captured British and German soldiers were incarcerated there after the Battles of Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781).\n\nFort Frederick was sold at auction in 1791 and lay abandoned until the American Civil War. The fort was garrisoned at the outbreak of war and was used as a gun emplacement to protect the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which paralleled the canal. The 1st Maryland Infantry (US) occupied the area in December 1861 and Company H fought in a skirmish at the fort against Confederate raiders on Christmas Day, 1861. The regiment left in February 1862. In October 1862, a picket from the 12th Illinois Cavalry briefly occupied the area. The military usefulness of the fort ended by 1862.\n\nIn 1922, the property was acquired by the State of Maryland for use as Maryland's first state park. The walls had deteriorated but were standing up to in places. Archaeological investigations and the discovery of the original plans allowed a complete reconstruction. Much of the restoration work of the 1930s was done by the Civilian Conservation Corps.\n\nThe fort is a large stone quadrangle with bastions at each corner. Each face of the curtain wall is about long, high and thick at the base. The bastions project diagonally about , are thick at the base, and were filled with earth to provide a platform. The main gate is located in the center of the south curtain wall. Two of the three barracks buildings have been restored. The west barrack is reconstructed to its 1758 appearance, while the east barrack contains displays regarding the history of the fort. The north barrack, known as the Governor's House, has not been reconstructed.\n\nIn addition to tours, displays, and exhibits at the fort, the park also offers a campground, fishing in Big Pool Lake, picnicking facilities, and a nature trail. The Western Maryland Rail Trail begins immediately to the west of the park.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2071000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071000", "title": "Mewar", "text": "Mewar\n\nMewar or Mewad is a region in the south-central part of Rajasthan state of India. It includes the present-day districts of Bhilwara, Chittorgarh, Pratapgarh, Rajsamand, Udaipur, Pirawa Tehsil of Jhalawar District of Rajasthan, Neemuch and Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh and some parts of Gujarat.\n\nFor centuries, the region was ruled by Rajputs. The princely state of Udaipur emerged as an administrative unit during the period of British East India Company governance in India and remained until the end of the British Raj era.\n\nThe Mewar region lies between the Aravali Range to the northwest, Ajmer to the north, Gujarat and the Vagad region of Rajasthan to the south, the Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh state to the southeast and the Hadoti region of Rajasthan to the east.\n\nThe word \"Mewar\" is vernacular form of \"Medapata\" (IAST: Medapāṭa), the ancient name of the region. The earliest epigraph that mentions the word \"Medapata\" is a 996–997 CE (1053 VS) inscription discovered at Hathundi (Bijapur). The word \"pata\" or \"pataka\" refers to an administrative unit. According to the historian G. C. Raychaudhuri, Medapata was named after the Meda tribe, which has been mentioned in Varāhamihira's \"Brihat-Samhita\". The 1460 Kumbhalgarh inscription associates the Medas with Vardhana-giri (modern Badnor in Mewar region). Historian Sashi Bhusan Chaudhuri associates the ancient Medas with the modern Mer people.\n\nThe 1285 CE (1342 VS) Mount Abu (Achaleshwar) inscription of the Guhila king Samarasimha provides the following etymology while describing the military conquests of his ancestor Bappa Rawal (Bappaka): \"This country which was, in battle, totally submerged in the dripping fat (\"medas\" in Sanskrit) of wicked people by Bappaka bears the name of Śrī Medapāṭa.\" Historian Anil Chandra Banerjee dismisses this as a \"poetic fancy\".\n\nThe northern and eastern portions of Mewar are made up of an elevated plateau while the western and southern portions were rocky and hilly with dense forests. The watershed divide between drainage of the Bay of Bengal and drainage of the Gulf of Khambhat runs almost through the centre of Mewar. The northern and eastern part of Mewar is a gently sloping plain, drained by the Bedach and Banas River and its tributaries, which empty northwest into the Chambal River, a tributary of the Yamuna River. The southern and western part of the region is hilly, and marks the divide between the Banas and its tributaries and the headwaters of the Sabarmati and Mahi rivers and their tributaries, which drain south into the Gulf of Khambhat through Gujarat state. The Aravalli Range, which forms the northwestern boundary of the region, is composed mostly of sedimentary rocks, like marble and Kota Stone, which has traditionally been an important construction material.\n\nThe region is part of the Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests' ecoregion. Protected areas include the Jaisamand Wildlife Sanctuary, the Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, the Bassi Wildlife Sanctuary and the Sita Mata Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\nMewar has a tropical climate. Rainfall averages 660 mm/year, and is generally higher in the southwest and lower in the northeast of the region. Over 90% of the rain typically falls in the period of June to September every year, during the southwest monsoon.\n\nThe state of Mewar was founded around 530 AD; later it would also, and ultimately predominantly, called Udaipur after the name of the capital. In 1568, Emperor Akbar conquered Chittorgarh, the capital of Mewar. In 1576, Maharana Pratap, the ruler of Mewar, was defeated at the Battle of Haldighati and Gogunda, Udaipur and Kumbalgarh were conquered. However through guerrilla warfare , Maharana Pratap recaptured western Mewar. In 1606, Amar Singh defeated the Mughals in the Battle of Dewar. In 1615, after four decades of skirmishing, Mewar and the Mughals entered into a treaty under which Mewar territory under the Mughals' possession was returned in exchange for the crown prince of Mewar attending the Mughal court and Mewar providing a force of 1,000 horsemen to the Mughals. When Udaipur State joined the Indian Union in 1949 it had been ruled by the Rajputs of Mori, Guhilot and Sisodia dynasties for over 1,400 years. Chittaurgarh was the capital of Sisodia clans of Rajputs of Mewar.\n\nBappa Rawal is considered the founder of the Mewar state. While his predecessors had enjoyed control over limited areas in the hilly regions in the west and southwest of Mewar, Bappa was the first ruler to expand the state close to its later boundaries. Bappa, who had his capital at Nagda (19 kilometres north of Udaipur), extended his possessions to the east by ousting Man Singh of the Mori (Maurya) clan from Chittor in 734 AD. He took on the title of 'Rawal.'\n\nFor half a century prior to 1818, the armies of Holkar, Scindia, and Amir Khan had plundered Mewar, pauperising its ruler and people. As early as 1805, Maharana Bhim Singh of Mewar approached the British for assistance but the Treaty of 1803 with Scindia prevented the British from entertaining the request. But by 1817, the British too were anxious to have alliances with Rajput rulers and the Treaty of Friendship, Alliances and Unity was concluded between Mewar and East India Company (on behalf of Britain) on 13 January 1818.\n\nUnder the treaty, the British Government agreed to protect the territory of Mewar, in return for which Mewar acknowledged British supremacy and agreed to abstain from political associations with other states and to pay one-fourth of its revenues as tribute for 5 years, and three-eighths in perpetuity. The British authorities granted the ruler of Udaipur a 19 gun salute.\n\nThe last ruler of Udaipur Kingdom signed the accession to Independent India on 7 April 1949.\n\nRana Laksha of the Sisodia Rajput clan with all his 10 sons had rallied in defence of Chittor but in vain. The Sardars decided that it was time to safeguard the royal lineage. There is mention of only two sons of Rana Laksha by name, Ari Singh and Ajay Singh. Ari Singh I had a son named Hammir Singh I who was taken by his uncle Ajay to Kelwara for safety. After the defeat of Mewar at Chittor by Alauddin Khalji, in which Rana Laksha and his son Ari Singh perished, the people began to rally behind Ajay who pursued a guerrilla campaign until he too died in the 1320s. The Sardars now picked Hamir Singh I as head of the Sisodia clan and rightful heir to the throne of Mewar. He married the daughter of Maldeo of Jalore, who now governed Chittor for the Delhi Sultanate. He overthrew his father-in-law and reclaimed his ancestral homeland.\n\nThe nobles of Mewar were numerous and powerful, enjoying rights and privileges that were unusual in other princely states. Mewar nobles exhibited \"few of the marks of vassalage observable at other courts\" and \"take rank above the heir-apparent - a custom unprecedented in India.\"\n\nDuring the rule of Umra Singh II (1700-1716), the nobles were arranged into three ranks:\nOver time, the number in each class has increased.\n\nAt the time of the 1901 census, the state was divided into 17 administrative sub-divisions - 11 \"zilas\" and 6 \"parganas\", the difference between a \"zila\" and \"pargana\" being that the latter was larger and broken up into further subdivisions. Further, there were 28 principal \"jagir\"s and 2 \"bhumats\". Each \"zila\" was administered by a \"hakim\", a state official, supported at each \"tehsil\" (a \"zila\" sub-division) by an assistant \"hakim\".\n\nThe principal forms of land tenure in the state were jagir, bhum, sasan, and khalsa. Jagirs were grants of land made in recognition service of a civil or political nature. Jagirdars, the holders of jagir, usually paid a fixed annual tribute called chhatund on an annual basis, and nazarana on the succession of a new Maharana. On the death of a jagirdar, the jagir reverted to the Maharana until the late jagirdar's successor was recognised by the Maharana. Those holding bhum tenures paid a small tribute or nominal quit-rent (bhum barar), and were liable to be called on for local service. Sasan (also known as muafi) holders were not liable for payments to the Maharana but taxes were sometimes recovered from them. Khalsa (crown lands) holders were cultivators who were undisturbed in their possession as long as they continued to pay land revenue. As of 1912, 38% of the land revenue of the State was from khalsa land, the rest from other forms of tenure.\n\nThe economy of the Mewar region relies primarily on tourism, the marble and stone industry, mining, handicrafts, zinc smelters, cement and tyre factories, as well as agriculture. Major crops include maize, groundnut, soybean, wheat, and mustard. Opium is also grown in the adjoining regions of the southeast (Pratapgarh and Nimbahera). Fishery also thrives in the region's various lakes, supported by a government fisheries department.\n\n\nThe fort was sacked thrice by enemy. The first sacking occurred in 1303 by Alauddin Khalji. In 1535 Bahadur Shah of Gujarat besieged the fort, causing the women to commit Jauhar. In 1568 the Mughal emperor Akbar captured the fort. This war between the Mewar and Mughal turned the fort to rubble. Akbar's dream to conquer the whole of Mewar was never fulfilled but Chittorgarh was not resettled by the royal family again.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2071023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071023", "title": "Hemifacial spasm", "text": "Hemifacial spasm\n\nHemifacial spasm (HFS) is a rare neuromuscular disease characterized by irregular, involuntary muscle contractions (spasms) on one side (hemi-) of the face (-facial). The facial muscles are controlled by the facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve), which originates at the brainstem and exits the skull below the ear where it separates into five main branches.\n\nThis disease takes two forms: typical and atypical. In typical form, the twitching usually starts in the lower eyelid in orbicularis oculi muscle. As time progresses, it spreads to the whole lid, then to the orbicularis oris muscle around the lips, and buccinator muscle in the cheekbone area. The reverse process of twitching occurs in atypical hemifacial spasm; twitching starts in orbicularis oris muscle around the lips, and buccinator muscle in the cheekbone area in the lower face, then progresses up to the orbicularis oculi muscle in the eyelid as time progresses. The most common form is the typical form, and atypical form is only seen in about 2–3% of patients with hemifacial spasm. The incidence of hemifacial spasm is approximately 0.8 per 100,000 persons.\n\nThis disorder occurs in both men and women, although it affects middle-aged or elderly women more frequently. Hemifacial spasm is much more common in some Asian populations. It may be caused by a facial nerve injury, a tumor, or it may have no apparent cause. Individuals with spasm on both sides of the face are very rare.\n\nThe first sign of hemifacial spasm is typically muscle movement in the patient's eyelid and around the eye. It can vary in intensity. The intermittent twitching of the eyelid, which can result in forced closure of the eye which gradually spreads to the muscles of the lower part of the face (Typical form- See Image). In atypical form the spasms start in the cheekbone area and spreads to the eyelid. Ultimately, all the muscles on that side are affected, nearly all the time. This sometimes causes the mouth to be pulled to the side. Experts have linked hemifacial spasm to facial nerve injury, Bell's palsy and tumors. Although the most frequent cause is a blood vessel pressing on the facial nerve at the spot where it leaves the patient's brain stem, sometimes there is no known cause. When the affected individual is younger than 40, doctors suspect an underlying cause such as multiple sclerosis.\n\nThree theories exist to explain the facial nerve dysfunction found in hemifacial spasm. The first proposed theory is ephaptic transmission, which is electrical activity crossing from one demyelinated neuron to another resulting in a false synapse. The second theory involves abnormal activity of axons at the facial nerve root end zone secondary to compressive damage/demyelination.\n\nThe third theory or \"Kindling theory\" involves increased excitability of the facial nerve nucleus due to feedback from a damaged facial nerve.\n\nIt is generally accepted as compression of the facial nerve by vessels of the posterior circulation. In detail compression of the seventh cranial nerve by a dolichoectatic (a distorted, dilated, and elongated) vertebral artery is accepted to be the general cause of hemifacial spasm. Less than 1% of cases are caused by tumor. Hemifacial spasm is much more common in some Asian populations.\n\nSeveral families with hemifacial spasm have been reported, suggesting a genetic etiology or predisposition in some cases. There appears to be an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance in these families with low penetrance, and except for a younger age at onset, the clinical features overlap with the idiopathic cases.Evaluation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes related to vascular change causing compression of blood vessels did not show an association with hemifacial spasm. Clarifying the role of genetic susceptibility in hemifacial spasm may help to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease.\n\nThere are several tests done to diagnose hemifacial spasm. Diagnosing a case of hemifacial spasm begins with a complete neurological exam, including an Electromyography (EMG – a test that measures and records electrical activity generated in muscle at rest and in response to muscle contraction), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI – a test that uses magnetic waves to make pictures of structures inside the head), Computed tomography (CT scan – a type of x-ray that uses a computer to make pictures of structures inside the head), and Angiography (an x-ray exam of the blood vessels when they are filled with a contrast material).\n\nStudies have shown that the most effective method of hemifacial spasm screening is MRI. In one study only 25% of the CT scans showed the abnormality in hemifacial spasm patients, whilst more than half of the MRI imaging demonstrated a vascular anomaly. MRI imaging should be the initial screening procedure in the assessment of patients with hemifacial spasm.\n\nThere is no known way to prevent hemifacial spasm.\n\nMild cases of hemifacial spasm may be managed with sedation or carbamazepine (an anticonvulsant drug). Microsurgical decompression and botulinum toxin injections are the current main treatments used for hemifacial spasm.\n\nMicrovascular decompression appears to be the most popular surgical treatment at present. Microvascular decompression relieves pressure on the facial nerve, which is the cause of most hemifacial spasm cases. Excellent to good results are reported in 80% or more cases with a 10% recurrence rate. In the present series approximately 10% had previously failed surgery. Serious complications can follow microsurgical decompressive operations, even when performed by experienced surgeons. These include cerebellar haematoma or swelling, brain stem infarction (blood vessel of the brain stem blocked), cerebral infarction (ischemic stroke resulting from a disturbance in the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain), subdural haematoma and intracerebral infarction (blockage of blood flow to the brain). Death or permanent disability (hearing loss) can occur in 2% of patients of hemifacial spasm.\n\nBotulinum toxin is safe and effective in the treatment of hemifacial spasm. Success rates range between 76-100%, but repeated injections may be required every 3 to 6 months. The injections are administered as an outpatient or office procedure. Whilst side effects occur, these are never permanent. Repeated injections over the years remain highly effective. Whilst the toxin is expensive, the cost of even prolonged courses of injections compares favourably with the cost of surgery. Patients with HFS should be offered a number of treatment options. Very mild cases or those who are reluctant to have surgery or Botulinum toxin injections can be offered medical treatment, sometimes as a temporary measure. In young and fit patients microsurgical decompression and Botulinum injections should be discussed as alternative procedures. In the majority of cases, and especially in the elderly and the unfit, Botulinum toxin injection is the treatment of first choice. Imaging procedures should be done in all unusual cases of hemifacial spasm and when surgery is contemplated. Patients with hemifacial spasm were shown to have decreased sweating after botulinum toxin injections. This was first observed in 1993 by Khalaf Bushara and David Park. This was the first demonstration of nonmuscular use of BTX-A. Bushara further showed the efficacy of botulinum toxin in treating hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating). BTX-A was later approved for the treatment of excessive underarm sweating. This is technically known as severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis – excessive underarm sweating with an unknown cause which cannot be managed by topical agents (see focal hyperhidrosis).\n\nThe incidence of hemifacial spasm is approximately 0.8 per 100,000 persons. Hemifacial spasm is more prevalent among females over 40 years of age. The estimated prevalence for women is 14.5 per 100,000 and 7.4 per 100,000 in men. Prevalence for hemifacial spasm increase with age, reaching 39.7 per 100,000 for those aged 70 years and older. One study divided 214 hemifacial patients based on the cause of the disease. The patients who had a compression in the facial nerve at the end of the brain stem as the primary hemifacial spasm and patients who had peripheral facial palsy or nerve lesion due to tumors, demyelination, trauma, or infection as secondary hemifacial spasm. The study found that 77% of hemifacial spasm is due to primary hemifacial spasm and 23% is due to secondary hemifacial spasm. The study also found both sets of patients to share similar age at onset, male to female ratios, and similar affected side. Another study with 2050 patients presented with hemifacial spasm between 1986 and 2009, only 9 cases were caused by a cerebellopontine angle syndrome, an incidence of 0.44%.\n\nThe earliest descriptions about hemifacial spasm is by Shultze in 1875 and Gowers in 1899. The etiology of hemifacial spasm and location of the abnormality have been debated for more than a century. Surgical treatment for hemifacial spasm in the early 20th century included neurolysis (destruction of nerve tissue), stretching the facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve), and high-pressure irrigation of the nerve with lactate ringer's solution. The medical regimens of that time involved injection of the nerve with ethanol, electrical stimulation, application of toxic compounds (nitrate of silver, zinc, arsenic, bromides) as well as medications such as Dilantin or other anticonvulsants.\n\nAdditional advances in understanding the etiology and improving treatments for hemifacial spasm did not occur until the mid-seventies. In 1977, 47 cases of hemifacial spasm underwent microvascular decompression of the facial nerve using the operating microscope. The results illustrated nerve-vessel conflicts (or cholesteatoma) to be located at the root exit zone of the facial nerve in all cases. The root exit zone is where the central glial axonal insulation of the nerve ends and the peripheral nerve axonal myelination begins, this is known as The Obersteiner-Redlich zone. Biopsies of the root exit zone demonstrated degeneration of axons, denuded axis cylinder and interrupted myelin. The results of the experiment strengthened the theory that vascular compression of the facial nerve was the primary cause of hemifacial spasm, and proposed a specific region of the facial nerve where the effects of longstanding compression results in nerve dysfunction.\n"}

It travels east to its terminus and junction with Interstate 680 in Fremont. SR 262 was built solely to be a link between the two interstates and lies at the point that Interstates 880 and 680 are closest together in the East Bay. north of SR 262, I-680 abruptly turns to the Northeast and into the Sunol and Livermore Valley thus making SR 262 a vital link between those valleys and the Silicon Valley to the south.\n\nPhysically SR 262 begins as a 6 lane road that has been built to freeway standards for its first half mile and after intersecting Kato Road and Warren Avenue with separated grade intersections built in 2008 and 2015, respectively. The remaining half mile is a 4-6 lane city street with two traffic lights at Warm Springs Blvd and Mohave Drive before terminating at a cloverleaf interchange at I-680.\n\nSR 262 is unsigned along its entire route and would be unnoticeable to the public if not for two guide signs placed in the early 2000s on south I-680 that designate the exit as \"SR 262 to I-880 Mission Blvd\". There is no other signage on I-880 that designates the road by its route number. Signage for the southbound I-680 toll express lane, opened in September 2010, indicates an exit at \"262 - Mission Blvd.\" Locals are largely unaware of the route designation and refer to the road as Mission Blvd exclusively. Street signage of Route 262 appeared in 2018 at Warm Springs Boulevard.\n\nSR 262 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.\n\nOriginally SR 262 was slated to run the route of present-day Oakland Road from San Jose to where present day Warm Springs Blvd and Mission Blvd intersect. This plan was scrapped when State Route 17 (later I-880) was constructed.

{"id": "2071032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071032", "title": "Banda Oriental", "text": "Banda Oriental\n\nBanda Oriental, or more fully Banda Oriental del Uruguay (Eastern Bank), was the name of the South American territories east of the Uruguay River and north of Río de la Plata that comprise the modern nation of Uruguay; the modern state of Brazil Rio Grande do Sul; and some of Santa Catarina, Brazil. It was the easternmost territory of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata.\n\nAfter decades of disputes over the territories, the 1777 First Treaty of San Ildefonso settled the division between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire: the southern part was to be held by the Spanish Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata and the northern territories by the Portuguese \"Capitania de São Pedro do Rio Grande do Sul\" ().\n\nThe Banda Oriental was not a separate administrative unit until the \"de facto\" creation of the Provincia Oriental () by José Gervasio Artigas in 1813 and the subsequent decree of the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata of 7 March 1814, which formally established the \"Gobernación Intendencia Oriental del Río de la Plata\" (), making it a constituent part of the United Provinces of South America.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spanish and the Portuguese, several tribes of indigenous people were living in this area as nomads. The principal ones were the Charrúas, the Chanás, the Guayanas and the Guaraníes. Juan Díaz de Solís discovered this territory in 1516. During the conquest of the Río de la Plata area by the \"Adelantados\" (1535–1590), the main concern was to reach the interior in search of precious metals, so this region remained mostly ignored. The first ephemeral Spanish attempts to start populated centres in this territory happened between 1527 and 1577. These were the \"Fortín de San Lázaro\" (actual Carmelo) and the \"Puerto de San Salvador\" (1527–1530) by Sebastián Gaboto, the \"Real de San Juan\" (1542–1553) and the \"Real de San Gabriel y Ciudad de San Salvador\" (1573–1577) by Juan Ortiz de Zárate.\n\nIn 1542 the Crown of Castile established the Viceroyalty of Peru, a colonial administrative district that originally contained most of Spanish-ruled South America, governed from the capital of Lima. The Banda Oriental was therefore officially under the administration of the Viceroyalty of Peru from 1542 up to 1776. Although the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) limited the Portuguese colonies to the east of the 46th meridian, in practice, the Portuguese were free to advance in most of the territory that was not colonized by the Spanish, which included most of the Banda Oriental.\n\nIn the early 17th century the territory was called \"Banda Charrúa\", later \"Otra Banda\" (\"other shore\"), and then Banda Oriental. Later the name was extended to encompass Entre Ríos, to describe the territories in those latitudes that lead to the \"Mar del Nord\" (Atlantic Ocean). The area north of the Banda Oriental was the territory called by the Guaraní word \"Mbiaza\" or \"Ibiazá\", rendered in Spanish as \"La Vera\". \nIn 1618, during the governance of Hernando Arias de Saavedra (commonly known as Hernandarias), the Banda Oriental was integrated into the Spanish colonial Governorate of the Río de la Plata. Following the recommendation of the King of Spain, Hernandarias introduced a large amount of cattle in the Banda Oriental, an act which has played a decisive role in the future of the economy of the area. Starting around 1626, fathers of the Franciscan order attempted to establish reductions south of Río Negro. Some of them were short-lived missions like the \"San Francisco de los Olivares de los Charrúas\", the \"San Antonio de los Chanáes\" and the \"San Juan de Céspedes\". In contrast, the one of \"Santo Domingo Soriano\", founded with Charrúas and Chanáes in Entre Ríos, Argentina, in 1664, was moved on the Isle of Vizcaíno, on the mouth of Río Negro and then in 1718 it was moved again at its present location in the modern Soriano Department.\n\nAnother notable development came from the reductions of the \"Compañía de Jesús\" further north the Uruguay River, where indigenous Guaraníes and Tapes were being kidnapped from the missions by the \"bandeirantes\" to be used as slaves in the coffee plantations of São Paulo. To prevent this, in 1631, father Antonio Ruiz de Montoya migrated with 12,000 Guaraníes further east, in the modern State of Paraná of Brazil, while in 1636, father Nicolás del Techo migrated with another 12,000 Tapes towards the modern Rio Grande do Sul, which constituted the north part of the Banda Oriental of the times.\n\nAlthough Spain claimed the territory of the Banda Oriental, based on the Treaty of Tordesillas, it did not officially belong to the Spanish Crown during the 17th century. The Portuguese, being able to advance without resistance in the sparsely populated territory, founded the city Colonia del Sacramento on the banks of Rio de la Plata, across from Buenos Aires, in 1680. Apart from being seen as an evidence that the Portuguese intended to occupy all of the territory, this port in the mouth of the Uruguay River also permitted the Portuguese ships to carry out illegal trade evading Spanish taxation. Spain took the city twice, in 1681 and in 1705, but had to give it back by the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713.\n\nThe following years saw an expansion of the Portuguese settlements around Colonia del Sacramento, until 1723, when Field Marshal Manuel de Freitas da Fonseca of Portugal built the Montevieu fort. As a reaction, on 22 January 1724 a Spanish expedition was sent from Buenos Aires, organized by the Governor of Río de la Plata, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, who forced the Portuguese to abandon the location and founded and fortified Montevideo. The Spanish started populating the city, initially with six families moving in from Buenos Aires and soon thereafter by families arriving from the Canary Islands who were called by the locals \"guanches\", \"guanchos\" or \"canarios\".\n\nIn this way Montevideo became the center of Spanish control over the Banda Oriental. Its government was carried out by the Cabildo, in which criollos (locally born people of pure or mostly Spanish ancestry) could participate. In 1750, the office of Governor of Montevideo was created, with jurisdiction in the southern departments of the modern Uruguay. The rest of the territories of the modern Uruguay, along with part of the modern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul remained under the jurisdiction of the Superintendencia de Buenos Aires, while another part of the territory of the Banda Oriental at the northwest was governed by the authorities of the Missions.\n\nThe Portuguese, having lost the possibility of building a fort in Montevideo, established the Fort of San Miguel in 1737 and then the much larger Fortaleza de Santa Teresa in 1762 on the Atlantic coast of the current Rocha Department, in order to keep a route open for their southward advances into the sparsely populated territories of the Banda Oriental.\n\nThe Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750) between the kings of Spain and Portugal, allowed further expansion of the Portuguese Empire west of the 46th meridian. The treaty also stipulated that Spain would receive Colonia del Sacramento and Portugal would receive the Misiones Orientales. This, however, resulted in the Guaraní War (1754–1756), after which the Treaty of El Pardo (1761) repealed all aspects of the previous treaty.\n\nThe First Cevallos expedition was a military action between September 1762 and April 1763, by the Spanish forces led by Don Pedro Antonio de Cevallos, Governor of Buenos Aires, against the Portuguese in the Banda Oriental as part of the Seven Years' War. The Portuguese territories of Colonia del Sacramento were conquered by the Spanish and the Anglo-Portuguese forces were defeated and forced to surrender and retreat. Colonia del Sacramento and the nearby territories came under Spanish control until the Treaty of Paris (1763), by which all the territory conquered by the first Cevallos expedition was given back to Portugal. Santa Tecla, San Miguel, Santa Teresa and Rio Grande de São Pedro, however, remained in Spanish hands, which became the cause of further Portuguese attacks.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Spanish–Portuguese War of 1776-1777, by the First Treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain returned the island of Santa Catarina to Portugal and recognized Rio Grande de São Pedro as Portuguese territory, but kept the Colonia del Sacramento, along with the Banda Oriental, and the Misiones Orientales. In this way the Banda Oriental became integrated into the Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata (1776–1814). The line that separated the Spanish from the Portuguese territories, however, was a sinuous one, which lacking any natural formations to define it precisely, underwent various changes during the next decades.\n\nIn 1796, the body of the Blandengues was formed to protect the ranchers and peasants from vagrancy, theft and contraband. The government, lacking resources, offered to pardon any outlaws that would join this body, and they in turn brought also their horses into it.\n\nA result of the Anglo-Spanish War (1796–1808) in Europe, were the British invasions of the Río de la Plata of 1806–1807. The invasions occurred in two phases. A detachment from the British army occupied Buenos Aires for 46 days in 1806 before being expelled. On 3 February 1807, during the Battle of Montevideo, the British captured the city and occupied it for half a year. They had to abandon it after their defeat in the Second Battle of Buenos Aires and the armistice of 12 August 1807. The social effects of the British invasions have been among the causes of the May Revolution of 25 May 1810.\n\nDuring the British occupation of Montevideo, José Gervasio Artigas, who had joined the body of Blandengues since 1797, organized groups of gauchos and engaged in guerrilla war against the invaders. As a result, he was promoted to Captain of the Blandengues by the Spanish in 1809. However, when the Primera Junta was proclaimed in Buenos Aires, Artigas abandoned the ranks of the Spanish and joined the revolution, which promoted him to Colonel. With little help from Buenos Aires, he was sent to organize a rebellion in the Banda Oriental, where Montevideo was now the new capital of the viceroyalty, with Francisco Javier de Elío as the new viceroy.\n\nThe Battle of Las Piedras (1811) was the decisive defeat of Elío by land, although he was still keeping Montevideo supported by naval forces. At this point, Elío allied himself with Brazilian forces and requested their intervention in the conflict. Fearing defeat, Buenos Aires signed a truce with Elío, recognizing him as the ruler of the Banda Oriental and half of Entre Ríos. Considering this a treacherous move, Artigas abandoned the blockade over Montevideo and moved to Entre Rios with his supporters.\n\n\nThe United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves conquered the southern part in 1817 and renamed it the Província Cisplatina. By the mid-1820s, the Thirty-Three Orientals led a revolution against its successor state (the Brazilian Empire), igniting the Cisplatine War. At its conclusion, in 1828, the former Provincia Oriental was declared an independent state, Uruguay, by the Treaty of Montevideo. Uruguaiana remained with Brazil.\n\nThe northern part, between the years of 1836 and 1845, formed a full independent republic, named as Riograndense Republic. This territory was reconquered by the Brazilian Empire in the Ragamuffin War, and rejoined the empire under the Poncho Verde Treaty. It is today the Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a friend of Hedylus and possibly of Theocritus. He may have been honoured by the city of Histiaea in about 263 BC.\n\nAsclepiades was the earliest and most important of the convivial and erotic epigrammists. Only a few of his compositions were intended as actual inscriptions, if any. Other poems sing the praises of those poets whom he especially admired, but the majority of his work that has survived is love songs. It is doubtful whether he is the author of all the epigrams (some 40 in number) which bear his name in the \"Greek Anthology\". He has been credited with creating the metre which bears his name, the Asclepiad metre.\n\nThe sole source for the known, unlacunaed epigrams of Asclepiades is the Greek Anthology. Most of Asclepiades's epigrams appear in both of the two principal Byzantine epigram collections that constitute the Greek Anthology: the Palatine Anthology and the Planudean Anthology. Epigrams xxxix and xliii appear only in the Planudean Anthology, which is the less complete of the two so far as the epigrams of Asclepiades are concerned, all the rest are in the Palatine Anthology. Some papyri have been recovered that contain portions of known epigrams and portions of otherwise unknown epigrams attributed to Asclepiades.\n\n\n"}

A bonkei is a temporary or permanent three-dimensional depiction of a landscape in miniature, portrayed using mainly dry materials like rock, \"papier-mâché\" or cement mixtures, and sand in a shallow tray. A bonkei contains no living material, in contrast with related Japanese art forms bonsai and saikei: bonsai contain living trees, and saikei contain living trees and other vegetation.\n\nIts three-dimensional character and permanence distinguish bonkei from bonseki, which is a Japanese form of sand-painting that produces mostly-flat images on a display tray, usually for transient viewing before being erased for a new creation. Although bonkei materials are usually dry, flowing water and seasides are often depicted, with varying colors of gravel or sand making up the land and the water elements. A bonkei may also contain miniature figures of people, animals, buildings, bridges, and other common outdoor items.\n\nThe goal of the form is to provide an aesthetically pleasing miniature landscape for display and contemplation. The landscape is depicted in full three dimensions, and contained in a wide, low-sided tray. Raised areas representing river banks, hills, cliffs, or mountains are built up from sculptable materials like \"ciment fondu\", clay, \"papier mache\", or a dried and powdered peat called \"keto\" in Japan. These sculpted elements are frequently painted to resemble the natural environment as closely as possible, for example, through painting ice, rock, and vegetation colors onto sculpted mountains. Flat areas representing plains or open water are covered with colored sand or gravel. Real rocks may be embedded in the landscape.\n\nHuman and animal figurines and miniature models of structures and vehicles are placed on top of the bonkei's base landscape to create a fully realized scene. Even model trees and other vegetation may be incorporated, though live plants are not generally considered elements of bonkei. The completed bonkei can be displayed in the home similar to \"a bonsai, a painting, or a floral arrangement - at proper height, against an uncluttered background\".\n\nBonkei is similar in some ways to the Japanese \"saikei\" (plant landscape), Chinese \"penjing\", or Vietnamese \"hon non bo\" art forms. Although the aesthetic goals and practical aspects of model railroads are quite different, some similarities with bonkei can be seen in the model railroader's depiction of the natural environment. Robert Behme says that bonkei differs from saikei in that a bonkei \"is essentially a dry landscape, and living plants are rarely used; a saikei depends exclusively on living plants for effect.\" As a result of this key difference, many bonkei specimens can last a long time with no maintenance, where a saikei requires frequent tending and a favorable environment for growth of the trees and other vegetation it contains.\n\n"}
{"id": "2071077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071077", "title": "Christine (1983 film)", "text": "Christine (1983 film)\n\nChristine is a 1983 American supernatural horror film directed by John Carpenter and starring Keith Gordon, John Stockwell, Alexandra Paul, Robert Prosky and Harry Dean Stanton. The film also features supporting performances from Roberts Blossom and Kelly Preston.\n\nWritten by Bill Phillips and based on Stephen King’s 1983 novel of the same name, the movie follows the changes in the lives of Arnie Cunningham, his friends, his family, and his teenage enemies after Arnie buys a classic Red and white 1958 Plymouth Fury named Christine, a car that seems to have a jealous, possessive personality - and a mind of its own. The film was dedicated to Robert \"Bob\" Dawn, who was the make-up supervisor for the film.\n\nUpon its release, the film grossed $21 million at the US box office. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics and has since become a cult classic.\n\nIn September 1957, at a Chrysler Corporation assembly plant in Detroit, the hood of a newly assembled, red-and-white 1958 Plymouth Fury slams down without warning and crushes the hand of a line worker inspecting its front end. Another worker climbs in to sit behind the wheel, letting the ash from his cigar fall on the front seat. At the end of the shift, the line supervisor notices the car still has the radio playing - he opens the door to turn it off and the worker falls out of the car to the floor dead.\n\n21 years later, in September 1978, Arnold \"Arnie\" Cunningham is an awkward and unpopular teenager in Rockbridge, California, with only one friend, football player Dennis Guilder. Arnie's life begins to change when he buys the now used and badly battered red-and-white 1958 Plymouth Fury from George LeBay, brother of the original owner, the late Roland LeBay, and is in need of extensive repairs. George tells Arnie several details about the car, including its name: \"Christine\". Since his parents will not let him keep the car at their house, Arnie begins to restore it at a do-it-yourself garage and junkyard owned by Will Darnell.\n\nAs he spends more of his time working on the car, he discards his glasses, dresses more like a 1950s greaser, and develops an arrogant, paranoid personality. Unbeknownst to Arnie, Dennis learns from Arnie's mom that the previous owner Roland actually committed suicide in the car and confronts George LeBay to find out more: the owner's daughter choked to death in it and his wife also committed suicide in it, the same day as Roland. George also tells Dennis that Roland tried to get rid of Christine after Roland's wife died in the car but Christine \"came back 3 weeks later\".\n\nDuring a football game, Dennis becomes distracted by the sight of Arnie kissing his new girlfriend, Leigh Cabot, in front of a now-perfect Christine and is tackled, suffering a career-ending injury. On a rainy evening at a drive-in movie, Arnie and Leigh start kissing and inside of Christine when suddenly one of windshield wipers stop working. Arnie goes outside to try to get them working again and while he's outside the car, Leigh begins to choke on a hamburger. Christine locks the doors and Arnie cannot get in to help Leigh but Leigh manages to pull the lock open and is saved when a man in the car next to them administers the Heimlich maneuver. Meanwhile, school bully Buddy Repperton - angry with Arnie over being expelled after a confrontation in shop class - vandalizes Christine with the help of his gang. Arnie is devastated and determined to repair Christine but is surprised to see her quickly restore herself.\n\nChristine then seeks out the vandals, crushing one in an alley, triggering a gas station explosion that kills two others and sets the car on fire and finally running down Buddy himself. After the badly burned Christine returns to Darnell's garage, Darnell climbs in to sit behind the steering wheel and is crushed to death against the steering wheel when Christine pushes the driver's seat forward. The next morning, Christine is back in its slot and fully repaired. State police detective Rudolph Junkins becomes suspicious of Arnie, having discovered paint from Christine at the scenes of two gang members' deaths. However, he has no direct evidence to implicate Arnie, who has an alibi.\n\nJunkins either does not know or cannot believe that Christine can drive herself. Following the choking incident and Christine's initial vandalization, Leigh breaks up with Arnie. Dennis and Leigh conclude the only way to save Arnie is to destroy Christine. They set a trap for it at Darnell's garage: Dennis waits at the controls of a bulldozer, while Leigh stands ready to close the garage doors and cut off Christine's retreat once it enters. However, Christine has been lying in wait under a pile of debris in the garage the entire time and when Leigh takes up her position at the door controls, it strikes. Christine crashes through Darnell's office in an attempt to get at Leigh. Arnie – who has been driving the car himself – is thrown through the windshield and impaled on a shard of glass, which kills him.\n\nDennis and Leigh attack Christine with the bulldozer but she continually repairs herself and strikes back. The battle continues until they repeatedly drive back and forth over the car, damaging Christine so much that she is unable to immediately regenerate. The next day, Dennis, Leigh and Junkins watch as Christine's remains are compacted by a car crusher in a junkyard. The solid single cube is then dropped on the ground in front of them. Junkins praises Dennis and Leigh for defeating the demonic vehicle, despite them mourning the loss of Arnie and how they couldn't save him. The three become alarmed when they hear 1950s rock 'n' roll music apparently coming from the cube, but it turns out to be coming from a worker's portable radio. Leigh subsequently comments, \"God, I hate rock 'n' roll.\"\n\nThe film ends as the camera zooms in to the cube and a small piece of the front grille twitches slightly and then \"Bad to the Bone\" by George Thorogood starts playing.\n\nProducer Richard Kobritz had previously produced the miniseries \"Salem's Lot\", also based on a Stephen King novel. Through producing the miniseries, Kobritz became acquainted with King, who sent him manuscripts of two of his novels, \"Cujo\", and \"Christine\". Kobritz purchased the rights to \"Christine\" after finding himself attracted to the novel's \"celebration of America's obsession with the motorcar.\"\n\nKobritz's first choice for director was John Carpenter, who was initially unavailable due to two projects: an adaptation of another King novel, \"Firestarter\", and an adaptation of the 1980 Eric Van Lustbader novel \"The Ninja\". However, production delays on these projects allowed Carpenter to accept the director position for \"Christine\". Kobritz and Carpenter had previously collaborated in the 1978 television film \"Someone's Watching Me!.\" Bill Phillips was Carpenter's choice for writer and was brought on shortly after Carpenter arrived. Carpenter was also joined by special effects supervisor Roy Arbogast, who had previously worked with Carpenter in \"The Thing\" (1982). According to Carpenter, \"Christine\" was not a film he had planned on directing, saying that he directed the film as \"a job\" as opposed to a \"personal project.\" He had previously directed \"The Thing\", which had done poorly at the box office and led to critical backlash. In retrospect, Carpenter stated that upon reading \"Christine\", he felt that \"It just wasn't very frightening. But it was something I needed to do at that time for my career.\"\n\nKing's novel, the source material for Carpenter's film, made it clear that the car was possessed by the evil spirit of its previous owner, Roland D. LeBay, whereas the film version of the story shows that the evil spirit of the car manifested itself on the day it was built. Other elements from the novel were altered for the film, particularly the execution of the death scenes, which the filmmakers opted for a more \"cinematic approach.\"\n\nInitially, Columbia Pictures had wanted to cast Brooke Shields in the role of Leigh due to her publicity after the release of \"The Blue Lagoon\" (1980), and Scott Baio as Arnie. The filmmakers declined the suggestion, opting to cast young actors who were still fairly unknown. Kevin Bacon auditioned for the role, but opted out when offered a part in \"Footloose\" (1984). Carpenter cast Keith Gordon in the role of Arnie after an audition in New York City; Gordon had some experience in film, and was also working in theater at the time; John Stockwell was cast at an audition in Los Angeles.\n\nNineteen-year-old Alexandra Paul was cast in the film after audition in New York City; according to Carpenter, Paul was an \"untrained, young actress\" at the time, but brought a \"great quality\" about the character of Leigh. According to Paul, she had not read any of King's books or seen Carpenter's films, and read the novel in preparation.\n\n\"Christine\" was shot largely in Los Angeles, California, while the location for Darnell's garage was located in Santa Clarita. Filming began in April 1983, merely days after the King novel had been published. An abandoned furniture factory in Irwindale was used for the opening scene. The film's stunts were primarily completed by stunt coordinator Terry Leonard, who was behind the wheel of the car during the high-speed chase scenes, as well as the scene in which the car drives down a highway engulfed in flames. During that scene, Leonard wore a Nomex firefighter's suit complete with breathing apparatus.\n\nAlexandra Paul's identical twin sister Caroline Paul wrote that she and her sister pulled a prank during filming, sending Caroline on set in place of Alexandra without telling Carpenter that they had made the switch until after he had shot a scene. She wrote, \"My highly skilled clutch-pushing actually made it into the movie.\"\n\nAlthough the car in the film is identified as a 1958 Plymouth Fury—and in 1983 radio ads promoting the film, voiceover artists announced, \"she's a '57 Fury\"—two other Plymouth models, the Belvedere and the Savoy, were also used to portray the malevolent automobile onscreen. John Carpenter placed ads throughout Southern California searching for models of the car, and was able to purchase twenty-four of them in various states of disrepair, which were used to build a total of seventeen copies of the film car. All cars were two door hardtops.\n\nTotal production for the 1958 Plymouth Fury was only 5,303, and they were difficult to find and expensive to buy at the time. In addition, the real-life Furys only came in one color, \"Buckskin Beige\", seen on the other Furys on the assembly line during the initial scenes of the movie, though the car in King's novel was ordered with a red-and-white custom paint job. The original Furies had anodized gold trim on the body and Fury script on the rear fender. In order to bypass the problem of obtaining the rare trim, the cars featured the more common Belvedere \"Dartline\" trim. Several vehicles were destroyed during filming, but most of the cars were Savoy and Belvedere models dressed to look like the Fury. At least one '57 Savoy was used, its front end modified to look like a '58.\n\nOriginally, Carpenter had not planned to film the car's regeneration scenes, but gave special effects supervisor Roy Arbogast three weeks to devise a way for the car to rebuild itself. Arbogast and his team made rubber molds from one of the cars, including a whole front end. One of the cars was stripped of its engine to accommodate internally-mounted hydraulics that pulled the framework inward, crumpling the car, with the shot then run backwards in the final film.\n\nOf the twenty three cars used in the film, the best known surviving vehicle was rescued from a junkyard and restored by collector Bill Gibson of Pensacola, Florida.\n\n\"Christine\" was released in North America on December 9, 1983, to 1,045 theaters.\n\nIn its opening weekend \"Christine\" brought in $3,408,904 landing at #4. The film dropped 39.6% in its second weekend, grossing $2,058,517 slipping from fourth to eighth place. In its third weekend, it grossed $1,851,909 dropping to #9. The film remained at #9 its fourth weekend, grossing $2,736,782. In its fifth weekend, it returned to #8, grossing $2,015,922. Bringing in $1,316,835 in its sixth weekend, the film dropped out of the box office top ten to twelfth place. In its seventh and final weekend, the film brought in $819,972 landing at #14, bringing the total gross for \"Christine\" to $21,017,849.\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Christine\" holds a 69% approval rating based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 5.94/10. The consensus reads: \"The cracks are starting to show in John Carpenter's directorial instincts, but \"Christine\" is nonetheless silly, zippy fun.”\n\nRoger Ebert gave the movie three out of four stars, saying: \"by the end of the movie, Christine has developed such a formidable personality that we are actually taking sides during its duel with a bulldozer. This is the kind of movie where you walk out with a silly grin, get in your car, and lay rubber halfway down the Eisenhower.\" Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" gave the film a middling review, saying: \"The early parts of the film are engaging and well acted, creating a believable high-school atmosphere. Unfortunately, the later part of the film is slow in developing, and it unfolds in predictable ways.\" \"Variety\" gave the film a negative review, stating: \"\"Christine\" seems like a retread. This time it’s a fire-engine red, 1958 Plymouth Fury that’s possessed by the Devil, and this deja-vu premise [from the novel by Stephen King] combined with the crazed-vehicle format, makes Christine appear pretty shop worn.\" \"Time Out\" said of the film: \"Carpenter and novelist Stephen King share not merely a taste for genre horror but a love of '50's teenage culture; and although set in the present, \"Christine\" reflects the second taste far more effectively than the first.\"\n\nThe film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in August 4, 1998. THX Lucasfilms LTD (with titles \"Digitally Mastered\"). DTS-ES, Dolby Digital. \nThe film was released on VHS by Columbia Pictures, and later in a special edition DVD in 2004. On March 12, 2013, Twilight Time video released the film on Blu-ray for the first time in a limited edition run numbered at 3,000 copies. On September 29, 2015, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment re-released the film on Blu-ray. The film was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on September 11, 2018.\n\nTwo soundtracks were released, one consisting purely of the music written and composed by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth, the other consisting of the contemporary pop songs used in the film.\n\nThe soundtrack album containing songs used in the film was entitled Christine: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and was released on LP and cassette on Motown Records. It contained 10 (of the 15) songs listed in the film's credits, plus one track from John Carpenter and Alan Howarth's own score.

The film is one of two released in 1976 that were based on a real illegal cross-continent road race that took place for a number of years in the United States (the other being\" The Gumball Rally\"). The same topic later became the basis for the films \"The Cannonball Run\", \"Cannonball Run II\" and \"Speed Zone\". The film was written and directed by Paul Bartel, who also directed \"Death Race 2000\".\n\nThe name of the film and the plot were inspired by Erwin G. \"Cannon Ball\" Baker (1882–1960), who traveled across the United States several times, and by the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, an illegal cross-continent road race introduced by Brock Yates to protest against the 55 MPH speed limit.\n\nThe Trans-America Grand Prix is an illegal race held every year between Los Angeles (Santa Monica Pier) and New York City. Recently released from jail, where he was serving a sentence for killing a girl while driving drunk, racing driver Coy \"Cannonball\" Buckman (David Carradine) hopes to win the race and get his career back on track. Racing team Modern Motors have promised a contract to either him or his arch-rival Cade Redman (Bill McKinney) who is also in the race – the contract will go to whichever of them wins. Coy is still on probation and when his parole officer, Linda Maxwell (Veronica Hamel), with whom he is having an elaborate affair, discovers he will be crossing state lines in violation of his parole, she attempts to stop him, only to have him force her to accompany him on the race.\n\nRedman also has company in the form of country singer Perman Waters (Gerrit Graham) and his manager Sharma Capri (Judy Canova) who have agreed to pay Redman's race expenses in return for his taking them with him to New York in his Dodge Charger.\n\nOther competitors include teenage surfer sweethearts Jim Crandell (Robert Carradine) and Maryann (Belinda Balaski) driving Maryann's father's Chevrolet Corvette, middle-aged Terry McMillan in a Chevrolet Blazer, three sexy waitresses, Sandy (Mary Woronov), Ginny (Glynn Rubin) and Wendy (Diane Lee Hart) in a souped-up van, arrogant German driver Wolfe Messer (James Keach) in a De Tomaso Pantera, preppy African-American Beutell (Stanley Bennett Clay) in a Lincoln Continental; he has been hired by a wealthy elderly couple to transport to New York for them (unaware that he is using it to enter the race) and Buckman's best friend Zippo (Archie Hahn) in a Pontiac Trans Am identical to Coy's. Unbeknown to Coy, his brother Bennie (Dick Miller) has bet heavily on the race and plans to use underhand methods to ensure Coy wins.\n\nAs the race degenerates into a violent demolition derby, Messer is blown up by Bennie, while McMillan attempts to cheat by having his Blazer flown from LAX to New York's LaGuardia Airport where he waits out the race with his mistress Louisa (Louisa Moritz). Beutell's borrowed Lincoln gets progressively more damaged as the race goes on, while Jim and Maryann face engine trouble with a broken fan belt. The rivalry between Coy and the increasingly unstable Redman gets out of control as the two fight and attempt to force each other off the road, with Coy crashing his Trans Am after Redman breaks the headlights. Switching to a 1969 Ford Mustang he borrows from some local hot-rodders, Coy has a last showdown with Redman, who has kicked Perman and Sharma out of his car after arguing with them. A piece of Perman's guitar, which Redman smashed in a rage after getting sick of Perman's singing and on-the-road radio broadcasts, gets lodged behind the car pedals, causing Redman to lose control and crash over the side of an unfinished bridge. He dies when the car explodes.\n\nBennie meanwhile, has sent a gunman to kill the driver of the \"other\" red Trans Am as it is beating Coy. He is unaware that the driver is Zippo or that Linda is now riding with him, as Coy thought it safer for her to do so since Redman was after him. While with Zippo, she has found out that it was Zippo who was driving the car in which the girl was killed, not Coy. Coy took the blame because he knew the weaker Zippo would never survive in jail.\n\nBennie's gunman shoots Zippo dead and the Trans Am crashes and explodes. Linda jumps clear, but is badly injured. Jim and Maryann see the wreck and pick up the comatose Linda, taking her to hospital. Behind them, the presence of the wrecked Trans Am on the freeway causes a multiple-car pileup.\n\nTerry McMillan and Louisa arrive first at the finish line, but Louisa lets slip that the Blazer was flown there and he is disqualified. The girls in the van and Coy are neck-and-neck as they cross into New York City (with Coy driving over the George Washington Bridge and the girls taking the Lincoln Tunnel until Sandy attempts to take a shortcut when the girls get lost and are stuck in traffic and the van crashes. Coy arrives at the finish line and is about to stamp his timecard, making him the official winner, when he is told about Zippo and Linda's accident and realizes Bennie caused it. He tears up his timecard so it can't be stamped and gives the pieces to Bennie, who is taken away by gangster Lester Marks (played by the film's director Paul Bartel) to whom he owes all the money he bet on Coy, presumably to be killed. Assured of his racing contract, Coy is taken to the hospital to be reunited with Linda by the team manager. Having decided to finish the race in spite of believing they cannot win having lost so much time, Jim and Maryann are the next to arrive at the finish line. They are surprised and overjoyed to be told they are the winners of the $100,000 first place prize.\n\nAt the hospital, Coy and Linda enjoy their reunion, while Beutell delivers the Lincoln – now completely wrecked – to its horrified owners in front of a hotel in the city.\n\nThe cameos by Martin Scorsese and Sylvester Stallone are uncredited, while Roger Corman and Don Simpson appear as district attorneys. Directors Joe Dante, Jonathan Kaplan and Allan Arkush have cameos, and former beach movie star and Transformers voice actor Aron Kincaid appears in a small role as one of two cops who pull over the girls in the van.\n\nBartel later said he worked for a year on \"Death Race 2000\" for $5,000 \"so when it was finished I desperately needed money. The only thing anybody wanted from me was another car picture, hence \"Cannonball\".

He attempted to build a new theory of disease, based on the flow of atoms through pores in the body. His treatments sought to restore harmony through the use of diet, exercise, and bathing.\n\nAsclepiades was born in Prusias-on-Sea in Bithynia. He travelled extensively when young, and seems at first to have settled at Rome to work as a rhetorician. In that profession he did not succeed, but he acquired a great reputation as a physician. His pupils were very numerous, and his most distinguished pupil, Themison of Laodicea, founded the Methodic school. It is not known specifically when he died, except that it was at an advanced age. It was said that he laid a wager with Fortune, that he would forfeit his character as a physician if he should ever suffer from any disease himself. Pliny the Elder, who tells the anecdote, adds that he won his wager, for he reached a great age and died at last from an accident. Nothing remains of his writings but a few fragments.\n\nThe family lineage of Asclepiades is not known. It is assumed that his father was a doctor due to ancient physicians coming from medical families. He received the names Philosophicus due to his knowledge of philosophy and Pharmacion for his knowledge of medicinal herbs. Antiochus of Ascalon said about Asclepiades, \"second to none in the art of medicine and acquainted with philosophy too.\"\n\nAsclepiades began by vilifying the principles and practices of his predecessors, and by asserting that he had discovered a more effective method of treating diseases than had been before known to the world. He decried the efforts of those who sought to investigate the structure of the body, or to watch the phenomena of disease, and he is said to have directed his attacks particularly against the writings of Hippocrates.\n\nDiscarding the humoral doctrine of Hippocrates, Asclepiades attempted to build a new theory of disease, and founded his medical practice on a modification of the atomic or corpuscular theory, according to which disease results from an irregular or inharmonious motion of the corpuscles of the body. His ideas were likely partly derived from the atomic theories of Democritus and Epicurus. All morbid action was reduced to the obstruction of pores and irregular distribution of atoms. Asclepiades arranged diseases into two great classes of \"Acute\" and \"Chronic\". Acute diseases were caused essentially by a constriction of the pores, or an obstruction of them by an excess of atoms; the Chronic were caused by a relaxation of the pores or a deficiency of atoms. Asclepiades thought that other mild disease were caused by a disruption in bodily fluids and pneuma. He separated illnesses into three separate categories: \"status strictus\" (too tightly held), \"status laxus\" (too loosely held), and \"status mixtus\" (a little of each). He also believed that there were no critical days of diseases, meaning that illnesses do not end at a definite time.\n\nAsclepiades' remedies were, therefore, directed to the restoration of harmony. He trusted much to changes of diet, massages, bathing and exercise, although he did employ emetics and bleeding. A part of the great popularity which he enjoyed depended upon his prescribing the liberal use of wine to his patients, and upon his attending to their every need, and indulging their inclinations. He would treat all his patients fairly and did not discriminate based upon gender or mental illness. He believed treating his patients kindly and amicably was essential to being a good physician. \"Cito tuto jucunde\" (meaning to treat his patients \"swiftly, safely, and sweetly\") was a motto that he followed. This contrasted with the behaviour of other physicians who practised during his life time who it was said had a tendency to be uncaring and have a lack of sympathy towards their patients.\n\nDigestion was a primary factor in Asclepiades' drug theory. Particles of food were seen as a main cause of indigestion. If the particles of food were small, digestion would follow its normal course. However, if the particles were too big, indigestion would occur. If an illness were to occur, he believed that drugs were not the solution. His prescribed treatment was food and wine (given in appropriate amounts) followed by an enema, which would extract the improper food doing the damage. This procedure would remove the cause of illness. Asclepiades believed that the use of drugs for cleansing was of no use - \"all the substances were produced by the drugs themselves\", but, rather, \"Treatment consists merely of three elements: drink, food and the enema\".\n\nAsclepiades was heavily influenced by Pythagoreanism and the early work of Democritus on herbal powers and remedies. Pliny the Elder says of him that, “Above all, he was helped by magean deceits, which prevailed to such a degree that they were strong enough to destroy confidence in all herbal remedies” and goes on to detail some of the magic powers of those plants, including two previously detailed by Democritus.\n\nAsclepiades used music therapy to treat mentally ill patients in order to maintain \"psychogenic equilibrium\". While Asclepiades was not the first to use music therapy, he used it to treat mental illness along with other ailments including viper bites and scorpion stings. Gentle music was recommended to those in a flippant state, while those in a sombre state were encouraged with music using the Phrygian mode. He did not recommend the use of a flute in any treatments because it was considered to be too energetic and would not have a calming effect on patients. He believed that the part of the body that was affected would dance to the music and expel the pain from the body.\n\nThe medical writers Galen and Aretaeus, both of whom lived in the 2nd century AD, credited Asclepiades with being the first individual to perform an elective (non-emergency) tracheotomy.\n\nAsclepiades advocated humane treatment of mental disorders, and had insane persons freed from confinement and treated them with natural therapy, such as diet and massages. Asclepiades is considered to be a pioneer physician in psychotherapy, physical therapy and molecular medicine.\n\nNotes\n\n"}

{"id": "2071113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071113", "title": "Ambivalence", "text": "Ambivalence\n\nAmbivalence is a state of having simultaneous conflicting reactions, beliefs, or feelings towards some object. Stated another way, ambivalence is the experience of having an attitude towards someone or something that contains both positively and negatively valenced components. The term also refers to situations where \"mixed feelings\" of a more general sort are experienced, or where a person experiences uncertainty or indecisiveness.\n\nAlthough attitudes tend to guide attitude-relevant behavior, those held with ambivalence tend to do so to a lesser extent. The less certain an individual is in their attitude, the more impressionable it becomes, hence making future actions less predictable and/or less decisive. Ambivalent attitudes are also more susceptible to transient information (e.g., mood), which can result in a more malleable evaluation. However, since ambivalent people think more about attitude-relevant information, they also tend to be more persuaded by (compelling) attitude-relevant information than less-ambivalent people.\n\nExplicit ambivalence may or may not be experienced as psychologically unpleasant when the positive and negative aspects of a subject are both present in a person's mind at the same time. Psychologically uncomfortable ambivalence, also known as cognitive dissonance, can lead to avoidance, procrastination, or to deliberate attempts to resolve the ambivalence. People experience the greatest discomfort from their ambivalence at the time when the situation requires a decision to be made. People are aware of their ambivalence to varying degrees, so the effects of an ambivalent state vary across individuals and situations. For this reason, researchers have considered two forms of ambivalence, only one of which is subjectively experienced as a state of conflict.\n\nThe psychological literature has distinguished between several different forms of ambivalence. One, often called subjective ambivalence or felt ambivalence, represents the psychological experience of conflict (affective manifestation), mixed feelings, mixed reactions (cognitive manifestation), and indecision (behavioral manifestation) in the evaluation of some object. Ambivalence is not always acknowledged by the individual experiencing it. Although, when the individual becomes aware to a varying degree, discomfort is felt, which is elicited by the conflicting attitudes about a particular stimulus.\n\nSubjective ambivalence is generally assessed using direct self-report measures regarding one's experience of conflict about the topic of interest. Because subjective ambivalence is a secondary judgment of a primary evaluation (i.e., I'm conflicted \"of\" my positive attitude towards the president), it is considered to be metacognitive. The point of these measures is to find out how much a person experiences ambivalence in a particular evaluation. Their report may be provided in a number of ways.\n\nPriester and Petty, for example, utilized a rating system where they had subjects rate the level of conflict they were experiencing on a scale from 0 (as in the subject experienced \"no conflict at all\") to 10 (as in the subject experienced \"maximum conflict\"). However, people do not like to experience the negative emotions associated with ambivalence and therefore may not acknowledge, or report, their level of conflict as accurately as possible. This makes the measure of felt ambivalence a bit less reliable than a researcher may desire.\n\nAnother measure of ambivalence that has been developed is called objective ambivalence or potential ambivalence, which represents the simultaneous acknowledgement of both positive and negative evaluations regarding a particular stimulus. Objective ambivalence is an indirect measure of attitude conflict that allows individuals to answer questions based on more accessible aspects of their attitude and is therefore generally viewed as an advantageous means of measurement. This indirect measure does not assume that the individual has complete knowledge and/or awareness of their attitudinal conflict and helps to eliminate confounding factors that may be affecting their attitudes.\n\nObjective ambivalence is generally assessed using a method first developed by Kaplan, in which a standard bipolar attitude scale (e.g., extremely negative to extremely positive) is split into two separate scales, each independently assessing the magnitude of one valence (e.g., not at all negative to extremely negative).If a person endorses both positive and negative reactions towards the same object, then at least some objective ambivalence is present.\n\nKaplan initially defined ambivalence as total affect (the sum of positive and negative reactions) minus polarity (the absolute difference of positive and negative reactions). For example, if objective ambivalence towards exercising was assessed using two separate 6-point scales, and a person indicated that his or her evaluation was slightly negative (e.g., 2 on a 6-point scale) and extremely positive (e.g., 6 on a 6-point scale), this person's ambivalence would be quantified by 2 times the lesser of these two evaluations (i.e., 4 in this example).\n\nKaplan's measure yields the formula: formula_1\nHere, S represents the smaller rating or reaction (called \"conflicting\" reaction in the seminal paper by Priester and Petty), and L represents the larger rating or dominant reaction.\n\nHowever, Kaplan's measure has largely been replaced in practice by one proposed by Thompson et al. Thompson' s formula fulfills the three necessary conditions for any scale measuring ambivalence as suggested by Breckler.\n\nThe three conditions are as follows:\nThompson et al. refined Kaplan's formula to incorporate Breckler's components: formula_2\n\nResearch has shown only a moderate correlation between felt and potential ambivalence, although, both measures are useful depending on what is being asked. Potential ambivalence is often utilized by ambivalence researchers to gather more information about diversity of attitudes across contexts. Each individual experiences the after-effects of unpleasant feelings in a different way, whether or not associated with ambivalence awareness.\n\nThere are two primary moderators that link felt and potential ambivalence: \"simultaneous accessibility\" and \"preference for consistency\".\n\nSimultaneous accessibility is when potential ambivalence depends on how quickly and uniformly conflicting evaluations come to mind. Positive and negative knowledge regarding beliefs about an attitude object are concurrently known, but not always accessible. Only when the connection of the evaluations are applicable and coinciding to awareness, does potential ambivalence result in felt ambivalence.\n\nPreference for consistency uses incentives to combine incoming stimuli with current variables in order to respond to approaching impulses. In other words, people often review past behaviors when making new decisions; if preference for consistency is high, they are more likely to ignore new information and are thus bias to past behaviors.\n\nTraditionally, attitudes were considered one-dimensional—from positive to negative—but given the rise of research findings, this perspective has lost much of its value. Ambivalence studies were a primary reason that attitudinal assessments demanded a new design. Because the basic assumption of an ambivalent attitude is that it is paradoxical, a one-dimensional perspective is likely to portray faulty information. For instance, a numerical rating of zero can be produced both by someone with a love-hate relationship toward an object, and someone who is completely indifferent about that object. There is a significant difference in the behaviors and experiences of those possessing strong conflicting attitudes, compared to those who are simply neutral. This perspective is unsuitable for examining ambivalence and based on current research does not appear to accurately reflect how attitudes function and are experienced.\n\nThe two-dimensional perspective separately rates positive and negative attitudes toward an attitudinal object. The relative magnitude of positive and negative rankings are recognized by this model, providing a distinction between ambivalence and indifference. By comparing the magnitude of attitudes, the two-dimensional perspective also allows for an approximation of the degree of ambivalence; similarity in the magnitude of an individual’s positive and negative attitude towards an object indicating ambivalence, and the strength of these attitudes reveals its degree. The two-dimensional view can report everything the one-dimensional perspective can, but it has the added ability to account for ambivalence. Though this model of attitude is clearly more useful for understanding and potentially assessing ambivalence than a one dimensional model it still suffers numerous paradoxes which are difficult to argue away without acknowledging that there is more contributing to one's attitudes and their stability than perceptions regarding the object alone. These issues prompt the recent emergence of multidimensional models.\n\nThe Multidimensional model for attitude deviates from the linear perspectives previously mentioned. Conceptually the multidimensional model can be thought of as a network of attitudinal hubs which form a web of contributions contributing to one's attitude about a particular object. Thus ones attitude toward an object is a product of the attitudes one holds for all related objects which are activated consciously or unconsciously when considering the object in question, and is not simply an attribution regarding the object alone in a vacuum. Ambivalence occurs when there are near equal weight of contributions of both positive and negative sources according to this perspective. Note in this view the ambivalent attitude is not tied directly to the object but rather the near equivalence of positive and negative contributing attitudes.\n\nThis model is very useful for understanding why attitude towards an object can fluctuate often within a relatively short span. If this model is accurate than a change in the degree of activation of particular objects related to the attitudinal object in question will alter the degree to which they contribute their attitudinal influence towards one's current attitude regarding the object in question. This allows for variance in attitude towards an object without requiring any permanent change in one's beliefs regarding neither the object nor the objects related to it. According to this model one's attitude towards eating a high calorie dessert food would likely become more positive during times when an individual is hungry, as the centers associated with the satiation property of food are now more active and contributing more influence to the attitude regarding consuming the dessert. The other contributing attitudes do not need to have been suppressed (though they can be) for the temporary change in attitude all that is required, is an increase in the output of one contributor.\n\nContinued or repeated activation of the same related objects to a given attitudinal object will likely be reinforced and over time lend more stability to the attitude, and are likely to diminish the activation of those objects not strongly activated; however, the contributing objects are themselves also subject to changes in attitudes regarding them, so no final resolution of stability will necessarily occur. In addition if the same conflicting attitudinal contributors are continuing to “fire together” they will both be reinforced and thus may not contribute towards the resolution of ambivalence.\n\nNot all attitude objects are linked to both positive and negative relations. This model is built on the idea that meta-cognition has to do with \"knowing about knowing.\" The process works if someone has the knowledge about cognition and is also able to control their thoughts. An evaluation creates initial thoughts that are then analyzed by a secondary thought which may vary in strength toward an assessment. Once an evaluation is obtained, the strength of the validity affects how the interpretation is perceived. If a successful univalent attitude is achieved, final evaluations are labelled as either true or false based on varying degrees of confidence.\n\nCognitive consistency theories were established on the premise that individuals prefer dependable and coherent cognition. Inconsistency in one's thoughts, feelings, emotions, values, beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors causes tension. In the past, consistency theorists focused primarily on the instinctive drive to reduce this psychological discomfort and return to a simple, balanced state. Unlike classical approaches, however, theories of attitudinal ambivalence are more concerned with the \"perceived \"paradoxical state itself.\n\nFritz Heider established the first approach in the growing family of consistency theories; balance theory seeks to understand one's thoughts regarding their personal relationship with others and with the environment. Triadic relationships are used to evaluate the structure and quality of attitudes within a given arrangement.\n\nSocial ties, for example, can be analyzed in terms of an individual's perception of the relationships between his or her self \"(p)\", another person \"(o), \"and the topic (e.g., issue, belief, value, object) of focus \"(x)\". According to Heider, a balanced triangle is accomplished when all three links are positive, or two are negative and one is positive (since a positive number is still achieved).\n\nThe overall assumption of balance theory is rooted in the philosophy that unbalanced states have a tendency to wreak havoc. Satisfying relationships require balance, otherwise, it is not uncommon to experience consequences like stress, tension, or ambivalence.\n\nEvaluative-cognitive consistency theory refers to a condition in which one holds opposing attitudes towards an object that are not of equal magnitude; the focus is the overall difference in evaluations, with no regard to magnitude.\n\n“Ambivalence is a function of the \"amount of conflict\" within an attitude, whereas evaluative-cognitive consistency is a function of the \"magnitude of the difference\" between evaluations.”\n\nIn a set of dimension scores, for example, positive 5 and negative 5 have the same degree of consistency as does the set of positive 9 and negative 1. Yet, the degree of ambivalence in each set is vastly different. This distinction is important when examining the implications and effects of ambivalence, since seemingly similar ratings are in fact quite different.\n\nThe two-dimensional perspective of attitudinal assessment can distinguish between ambivalence and evaluative-cognitive consistency. As ratings increase, both ambivalence and evaluative-cognitive consistency have a tendency to be less stable and less effective at predicting behavior.\n\nPast studies have linked ambivalent mental states to slower response times (due to low accessibility) and mild attitudes, although theories of evaluative-cognitive consistency have yet to report such findings.\n\nThe feeling of discomfort that results from inconsistent cognition is a powerful determinant of human behavior. The emergence of research on intellectual tension dates back to the mid-20th century, and has been a hot topic in social psychology ever since. In 1957, Leon Festinger was the first to investigate the phenomenon, thereupon coining the theory of cognitive dissonance. Festinger and other early psychologists held the notion that cognitive dissonance was the result of any \"two \"conflicting thoughts or opinions. Currently, however, research has proven that not all cognitive inconsistencies are equally upsetting, for it is not necessarily the dissonance itself that causes strife, rather, it is the individuals construct of the given contention.\n\nDissonance, then, is characterized as a discrepancy between an attitude held by an individual and the actual behavior that is practiced by that individual, whereas ambivalence is seen as having a disparity within the attitude itself. Though unique, the ambivalent state, still, is closely connected to dissonance theory, being its most common product.\n\nIndividuals seek to satisfy a stable and positive self-image. For this reason, the greatest tension is encountered when there is an incongruity between who one thinks they are and their actual behavior. Such threats to self-esteem evoke motivation to rid oneself of the distress. According to present research, there are three widely accepted methods to reduce cognitive dissonance:\n\nAs noted above, the desire to maintain one's preconceived notions can have vast implications. Studies have shown it is not uncommon for people to distort reality while attempting reduce ambivalence. The manner by which one chooses to replace unwanted thoughts is mostly an unconscious process, yet several factors influence the ability and likelihood of doing so.\n\nInformation processing for ambivalent attitudes is less efficient and takes longer than processing of attitudes that are relatively univalent. The information is less accessible, so it takes longer for a person to integrate multiple viewpoints regarding an attitude object into one cohesive opinion or judgement. The lack of accessibility here does serve to reduce a biased thought process. Yet, since it takes a greater amount of effort to resolve two conflicting attitudes, if one desires to form a conclusion, a more extensive thought process is necessary.\n\nResearchers have sought to understand the relationship between objective and subjective ambivalence. Thompson and his colleagues argue that people with positive and negative evaluations which are of similar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -3) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are of dissimilar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -1). Similarly, they argue that even with relatively similar positive and negative evaluations, people whose evaluations are more extreme (e.g., +6 and -5) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are less extreme (e.g., +2 and -1).\n\nThe Griffin formula, also known as the similarity-intensity model: formula_3\n\nHere, P and N are the magnitude of positive and negative reactions, respectively.\n\nSome research has stated that as the relative contribution of dominant reactions decreases, the magnitude of conflicting reactions increases. Other studies have found that objective ambivalence predicts subjective ambivalence to a greater extent when both the positive and negative reactions are accessible, or when a decision about the attitude object is imminent. Still, more evidence has demonstrated that objective ambivalence is not the only precursor to subjective ambivalence. For example, interpersonal ambivalence, the presence of attitudes which are in conflict with those of important others, independently predicts subjective ambivalence, as does the mere anticipation of information which may conflict with one's preexisting attitude.\n\nBoth personal and circumstantial aspects must be considered in order to accurately assess relationship sustainability between subjective and objective ambivalence.\n\nIndividual characteristics are essential in deciding the most beneficial coping strategies. Research has shown that certain personality traits may impact an individuals likelihood of experiencing ambivalence. There are certain personality traits that aren't as relevant to ambivalence, such as the need for closure. Other components may alter these traits that may contribute toward ambivalence, such as tolerance to ambiguity. Particularly, those possessing the need for cognition, or the inclination to evaluate the discrepancies between positive and negative emotions, are less likely to experience ambivalence. In other words, the desire to resolve issues, which requires a great deal of cognitive resources, fosters cognitive strength and thus the ability to overcome ambivalence.\n\nAmbivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in non congruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes. Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing.\n\nIndividuals with a greater concern for invalidity experience a heightened amount of ambivalence, presumably because they are concerned with making wrongful judgments, and as a result, efforts to adjust attitude become inhibited. Response to ambivalence, then, is affected by an individual's need for consistency; hence, the higher the need for consistency, the more adverse the reaction will be to maintaining two contradictory attitudes simultaneously, whereas someone with a reduced need for consistency will experience less mental frustration Those seeking to rectify inconsistencies and resolve conflict are able to reject ambivalence better than most.\n\nAdditionally, some individuals have a more pronounced fear of invalidity than others. When this fear is experienced to a stronger degree, these individuals will not want to acknowledge the ambivalence as it is especially uncomfortable. Since the ambiguity is not being resolved, it will persist within the person.<nowiki> </nowiki>Gebauer, Maio, and Pakizeh discuss the possibility that many perfectionists, despite the seemingly positive qualities exerted, are at risk of neglecting internal inconsistencies. Consequently, it is not unlikely for those individuals to confront a plethora of unexplained, ambivalent feelings.\n\nAmbivalence will emerge when two (or more) goals valued by an individual are in conflict regarding the same attitudinal object. The individual becomes ambivalent about the object to which they both reference, not as much when regarding the individual goals themselves.\n\nMany decisions as common as food consumption or selection can invoke some degree of ambivalence\nevery day. An action can seem to have pleasant outcomes, but it can simultaneously cause issues as well. Emotions or attitudes that are ambivalent may spark both quick and far-off consequences that are inconsistent. A chronic dieter, for example, may experience ambivalence between the goals of eating enjoyment and weight control. Each of these goals independently are viewed as positive, but when conjoined in regards to actually eating more food, the resulting conflict prompts ambivalence. The object of eating enjoyment and the object of losing weight are both regarded with positive attitude, but these two goals are incongruent with each other and are both activated when considering eating.\n\nThe goal driven ambivalence that produces several forms of behavior modification may have profound implications on the behaviors and outcomes. Some examples are overcoming addiction, procrastination, health maintenance, and many others. Much of the focus of previous work has been concentrated on pain avoidance and pleasure seeking (focus on the ambivalent object itself), and not enough to the \"pleasure\" goal objectives related to and driving the conflict. Under certain circumstances, people who are exposed to unpleasant experiences are motivated to decrease unpleasant feelings toward ambivalence. One way to accomplish such a task is by acquiring new knowledge that can result in more immediate conclusions about the attitude object, or result in an adjustment in the individuals attitudes regarding the contributing goals which prompted the conflict.\n\nAmbivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes and are thought to have less of an influence on behavior. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in incongruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes. Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing.\n\nAmbivalence is often the result of conflict arising from personal or social values. Different cultures, and the individuals within them, have different values surrounding race, ethnicity, nationality, class, religion or beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and health status. Social constructs and perceived norms and values within a given society create contradictory feelings for many individuals. If opposing values are activated by the same object they are likely to clash upon encounter.\n\nConflicted value items do not need to come from the same category, but to be considered a contributor of ambivalence, discordance must occur.\n\nThe attitudinal object of women in the workplace could, for example, be affected by religious or political values. The contributing value systems are both held in positive regard but are opposed to each other in reference to the attitudinal ambivalent item. The amount of ambivalence experienced corresponds to the positive regard of each value contributing to the conflict. In other words, weakly held conflicting values should not generate as much ambivalence as strongly held values.\n\nAffective ambivalence (A+/A-) refers to disparity between feelings, whereas cognitive ambivalence (C+/C-) focuses on the disagreement between beliefs. Together, the notion of affective-cognitive ambivalence (A+/C-) or (A-/C+) embodies the commonly known conundrum of “\"the heart vs. mind conflict.\"”\n\nWhen each state is in balance, the influence on attitude is equal (A+/C+). Yet, there is compelling evidence that affect tends to overpower cognition (A+/C-).\n\nThat is to say, the degree of ambivalence construed at any given moment can alter the mechanisms by which one views the world. When ambivalent cognitive states become psychologically agonizing, motivation rises to eliminate distress. Under those circumstances, people generally pay more attention to information that is relevant to their ambivalent state, in particular when it is perceived as having the potential to reduce discomfort.\n\nAmbivalence is often conceptualized as a negative predictor of attitude strength. That is, as an attitude becomes more ambivalent, its strength decreases. Strong attitudes are those that are stable over time, resistant to change, and predict behavior and information processing.\n\nStudies have found that ambivalent attitudes are less stable over time, less resistant to change, and less predictive of behavior.\n\nAmbivalent attitudes are subject to change based on the concepts, feelings, or objects that are salient at the time. Since an ambivalent attitude is one in which positive and negative feelings are held simultaneously, the strength of either may wax or wane depending on what context the individual finds themselves in; different aspects of an attitude may be activated across situations.\n\nAmbivalent attitudes are known to be susceptible to persuasion. Since there is less certainty associated with an ambivalent attitude, both facts and trivial information are assessed, assimilated, and determinant of one's attitude. Accordingly, this may bias or persuade an individual's attitude. Strong attitudes, on the other hand, are less likely to be manipulated because they are essentially \"anchored in knowledge structures\".\n\nArmitage and Conner conducted a study regarding attitudes toward eating a low-fat diet. Attitudes of a high ambivalence group and a low ambivalence group were recorded two times within five months. Following an attitude change intervention the high ambivalence group demonstrated a significant positive change in attitude toward the diet (compared to a control group) whereas the low ambivalence group demonstrated very little change if any.\n\nIn situations that highlight one dimension over the other, individuals who are high in ambivalence are more likely to embrace the clear-cut better aspect of the attitude object.\n\nThe concept of ambivalence was introduced into psychiatric parlance by Eugen Bleuler, who used it in print for the first time in his 1910 article \"Vortrag über Ambivalenz\". Bleuler distinguished three main types of ambivalence: volitional, intellectual, and emotional. Volitional ambivalence refers to an inability to decide on an action—what Montaigne called \"a spirit justly balanced betweene two equal desires\". The concept (if not Bleuler's term) had a long prehistory, reaching back through Buridan's ass, starving between two equally attractive bales of hay in the Middle Ages, to Aristotle. Intellectual ambivalence—the sceptical belief that \"There is no reason but hath a contrary to it\" —also follows a long tradition reaching back through Montaigne to Sextus Empiricus and Pyrrho. (Freud considered Bleuler's stress on intellectual ambivalence particularly appropriate given his own ambivalence towards Freud's intellectual constructs, alternatively praising and criticizing them). Emotional ambivalence involved opposing affective attitudes towards the same object, as with the man who both loved and hated his wife.\n\nWhile mainly dealing with ambivalence in relation to the psychological splitting of schizophrenia, Bleuler also noted how \"in the dreams of healthy persons, affective as well as intellectual ambivalence is a common phenomenon\".\n\nFreud was swift to pickup Bleuler's concept of ambivalence, applying it to areas he had previously dealt with in terms of ambiguous language, or the persistent co-existence of love and hatred aimed at the same person. Freud also extended the scope of Bleuler's term to cover the co-existence of active and passive trends in the same instinctual impulse—what Freud called \"pairs of contrary component instincts\" such as looking and being looked at.\n\nKarl Abraham explored the presence of ambivalence in mourning—something he thought to be a universal phenomenon. Others in psychoanalysis have traced the roots of contradictory impulses (usually love and hate) to very early stages of psychosexual development.\n\nDefences against feeling both of the two contradictory emotions include psychological repression, isolation and displacement. Thus, for example, an analytic patient's love for his father might be quite consciously experienced and openly expressed—while his \"hate\" for the same object might be heavily repressed and only indirectly expressed, and thus only revealed in analysis. A drug addict may feel ambivalently about their drug of choice; they are aware of their drug use as a negative-impact agent in their lives (socially, financially, physically, etc.) while simultaneously seeking and using the drug because of the positive-impact results they receive from the drug's usage (the \"high\"). (More recent discourse of addiction as a mental health concern and chemically-induced/encoded \"imperative\", rather than as a behavioral \"choice\", complicates the notion of ambivalence as it relates to addiction.)\n\nAnother relevant distinction is that whereas the psychoanalytic notion of \"ambivalence\" sees it as engendered by all neurotic conflict, a person's everyday \"mixed feelings\" may easily be based on a quite realistic assessment of the imperfect nature of the thing being considered.\n\nPhilosophers such as Hili Razinsky consider how ambivalence relates to other aspects of the human experience, such as personhood, action, and judgement, and what it means that strict ambivalence is possible.\n\nThe first too write about ambivalence in 2004 was Susan Peabody who donated the concept to Love Addicts Anonymous.\n"}

The player takes control of Scratchy as he plays through various mini golf courses, trying to achieve a good score, while at the same time avoiding Itchy's attacks. Itchy uses weapons such as grenades, bazookas, chainsaws, meat cleavers, and dynamite. Scratchy can acquire items, such as a baseball bat or throwing knives, and power-ups to defend himself against Itchy. He can also use his putter as a weapon. There are a total of nine levels, or holes, in the game.\n\n\"Itchy & Scratchy in Miniature Golf Madness\" was developed by Beam Software and published by Acclaim. The game was released exclusively for the hand-held Game Boy console in November 1994.

But then again, there's nowhere near the amount of flicker, either. Scratchy's 'deaths' are pretty spectacular, nonetheless. I was able to get through a few rounds on the Super Game Boy, and the default colors were quite nice. (No custom border on the screen, though. Sigh.) Still, I'm hoping that Acclaim eventually manages to port this game over to the Game Gear.\" Kapalka gave the game 2.5/4 stars.\n"}

Its grounds are divided into six concentric baileys, which were formerly walled and separated by moats. It is unusual in that its Edo period \"tenshu\" and most of its outline remains intact. Noted historian and author Shiba Ryōtarō praised it as one of the \"Seven Famous Castles of Japan\" in his travel essay series \"Kaidō wo Yuku\".\n\nDuring the late Sengoku period, former Nambu retainer Ōura Tamenobu was awarded revenues of 45,000 \"koku\" by Toyotomi Hideyoshi for his role in the Battle of Odawara in 1590. He took the family name of Tsugaru at that time. At the Battle of Sekigahara, he sided with Tokugawa Ieyasu and was subsequently confirmed as lord of Hirosaki Domain with revenues increased to 47,000 \"koku\".\n\nIn 1603, he began work on a castle in Hirosaki; however, work was suspended with his death in Kyoto in 1604. Work was resumed by his successor, Tsugaru Nobuhira in 1609, who stripped Horikoshi Castle and Ōura Castle of buildings and materials in order to speed its completion. \n\nThe current castle was completed in 1611. However, in 1627, the 5-story \"tenshu\" was struck by lightning and destroyed by fire. It was not rebuilt until 1810 when the present 3-story structure was erected, but at the southeast corner, rather than the original southwest location. It was built by the 9th daimyō, Tsugaru Yasuchika.\n\nWith the Meiji Restoration and subsequent abolition of the han system, the Tsugaru clan surrendered the castle to the new Meiji government. In 1871, the castle was garrisoned by a detachment of the Imperial Japanese Army, and in 1873 the palace structures, martial arts school and most of the castle walls were pulled down. In 1894, the castle properties were donated by the Tsugaru clan to the government for use as a park, which opened to the general public the following year. In 1898, an armory was established in the former Third Bailey by the IJA 8th Division. In 1906, two of the remaining yagura burned down. In 1909, a four-meter-tall bronze statue of Tsugaru Tamenobu was erected on the site of the \"tenshu\". In 1937, eight structures of the castle received protection from the government as “national treasures”. However, in 1944, during the height of World War II, all of the bronze in the castle, including roof tiles and decorations, were stripped away for use in the war effort.\n\nIn 1950, under the new cultural properties protection system, all surviving structures in the castle (with the exception of the East Gate of the Third Bailey) were named National Important Cultural Properties (ICP). In 1952, the grounds received further protection with their nomination as a National Historic Site. In 1953, after reconstruction, the East Gate of the Third Bailey also gained ICP status, giving a total of nine structures within the castle with such protection.\n\nExtensive archaeological excavations from 1999-2000 revealed the foundations of the former palace structures and a Shinto shrine. In 2006, Hirosaki Castle was listed as one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation.\n\nIn order to repair the castle's stone walls directly below the \"tenshu\", the entire \"tenshu\" was removed in autumn 2015, and will be returned to its original position in 2021..\n\nThe current \"tenshu\" of the castle was completed in 1811. It is a three-story building with three roofs, and a height of 14.4 meters. The design is smaller than early Edo-period varieties of \"tenshu\", and it was built on a corner of the inner bailey on the site of a \"yagura\", rather than the stone base of the original \"tenshu\". The small size was partly due to the restricted finances of the domain towards the end of the Edo period, but its location and design were also intended to alleviate concerns which might be raised by the Tokugawa shogunate should a larger structure be built. At present, it is a separate standing structure; however, prior to 1896 it had an attached gatehouse.\n\nThe \"tenshu\" is surrounded by three surviving \"yagura\" from the Edo period (the Ninomaru Tatsumi Yagura, Ninomaru Hitsujisaru Yagura, Ninomaru Ushitora Yagura), on its second bailey, and five surviving gates (Sannomaru Ōtemon Gate, Sannomaru East Gate, Ninomaru South Gate, Ninomaru East Gate, Kitanokuruwa North Gate) in the walls of its second and third baileys. All of these structures, including the \"tenshu\" itself, are National Important Cultural Properties.\n\nThe surrounding Hirosaki Park around the castle grounds is one of Japan's most famous cherry blossom spots. Over a million people enjoy the park's 2600 trees (which were originally planted around in grounds in 1903) during the \"sakura matsuri\" (cherry blossom festival) when the cherry blossoms are in bloom, usually during the Japanese Golden Week holidays in the end of April and beginning of May.\n\nHirosaki city holds an annual winter four-day \"Hirosaki Castle Snow Lantern Festival\". The festival had attracted 310,000 visitors in 1999 and included 165 standing snow lanterns and 300 mini snow caves.\n\n\n\n"}

On U.S. Highway 61, the airport is owned by the city of Dubuque and is operated as a department of the city government. The city council appoints people for four-year terms to the Airport Commission board, which oversees the airport. For day-to-day operations, the Commission hires an airport manager. DBQ is used for general aviation and sees one airline. A charter service is run by Sun Country Airlines. The airport offers maintenance and refueling services, including service for jets.\n\nThe National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a \"primary commercial service\" facility. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 42,870 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 39,359 in 2009 and 33,861 in 2010.\n\nThe 2013 Federal sequester would have resulted in the closure of the airport's control tower, but the Federal Aviation Administration ultimately reversed its decision.\n\nThe first airline flights at Dubuque were Mid-Continent DC-3s in 1950. In 1955 successor Braniff was replaced by Ozark, which pulled out its DC9s and FH227s in 1981.\n\nNorthwest Airlines announced on February 7, 2008 that its regional partner Mesaba Airlines (Northwest Airlink) would return to Dubuque with twice daily Saab 340s to Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. These flights began on June 20, 2008. On July 2, 2009 the merged Delta/Northwest Airlines announced it would end service to Dubuque, leaving DBQ with one airline.\n\nDubuque Regional Airport covers 1,240 acres (502 ha) at an elevation of 1,077 feet (328 m). It has two concrete runways: 18/36 is 6,327 by 150 feet (1,928 x 46 m) and 13/31 is 6,502 by 100 feet (1,982 x 30 m).\n\nIn the year ending September 30, 2017 the airport had 50,301 aircraft operations, average 138 per day: 96% general aviation, 4% air taxi, <1% military and <1% airline. In September 2017, 63 aircraft were based at the airport: 52 single-engine, 9 multi-engine, 2 jet and 1 helicopter.\n\nThe University of Dubuque has a flight operations center at the airport that provides for pilot training in the school's aviation programs. This includes ground school and actual flight training. The University has two hangars for their aircraft and a third hangar that is shared.\n\nThe terminal has free Wi-Fi internet access. The airport recently installed enclosed walkways at the gates, allowing passengers to walk to the planes without going outdoors. The terminal has an ATM, vending machines, and gaming machines. On June 22, 2018 the airport lost its restaurant (The Hangar Bar & Grille), due to American Airlines reducing its flights at the airport. The terminal has three gates for airline passengers and a jet bridge. The terminal has a baggage carousel, desks for three airlines, and rental car services including Avis and Hertz.\n\nAmerican Eagle ERJ-145s fly to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago three times a day.\n\nThe airport has been recognized by the Federal Aviation Administration a number of times for its commitment to safety. It won the FAA's \"\"Airport Safety Enhancement Award\"\" in 1994, 1997, 2000, and 2003. In order to receive this honor, an airport must be free from discrepancies during an inspection for three consecutive years. In 2008, the Dubuque Regional Airport marked 18 consecutive years of perfect safety inspections in accordance with FAR Part 139. That record is unmatched among the approximately 600 certified U.S. airports.\n\n\nTo update facilities and accommodate growth, the City of Dubuque announced plans in 2007 to build a new, larger terminal building. The new $23 million facility is part of the airport's master improvement plan; it opened on June 9, 2016.\n\nThe city has expressed interest in courting more airlines. Until recently, Dubuque Regional had up to three air carriers. Two were eliminated when the airline industry met hard times after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. With strong passenger numbers, a growing tourism industry, and financial stability among air carriers, expanded service seems likely in Dubuque.\n\n\n"}

Bessel filters are often used in audio crossover systems.\n\nThe filter's name is a reference to German mathematician Friedrich Bessel (1784–1846), who developed the mathematical theory on which the filter is based. The filters are also called Bessel–Thomson filters in recognition of W. E. Thomson, who worked out how to apply Bessel functions to filter design in 1949. (In fact, a paper by Kiyasu of Japan predates this by several years.)\n\nThe Bessel filter is very similar to the Gaussian filter, and tends towards the same shape as filter order increases. While the time-domain step response of the Gaussian filter has zero overshoot, the Bessel filter has a small amount of overshoot, but still much less than common frequency domain filters.\n\nCompared to finite-order approximations of the Gaussian filter, the Bessel filter has better shaping factor, flatter phase delay, and flatter group delay than a Gaussian of the same order, though the Gaussian has lower time delay and zero overshoot.\n\nA Bessel low-pass filter is characterized by its transfer function:\n\nwhere formula_2 is a reverse Bessel polynomial from which the filter gets its name and formula_3 is a frequency chosen to give the desired cut-off frequency. The filter has a low-frequency group delay of formula_4. Since formula_5 is indeterminate by the definition of reverse Bessel polynomials, but is a removable singularity, it is defined that formula_6.\n\nThe transfer function of the Bessel filter is a rational function whose denominator is a reverse Bessel polynomial, such as the following:\n\nThe reverse Bessel polynomials are given by:\n\nwhere\n\nThe transfer function for a third-order (three-pole) Bessel low-pass filter with formula_14 is\n\nwhere the numerator has been chosen to given unity gain at zero frequency (\"s\" = 0).The roots of the denominator polynomial, the filter's poles, include a real pole at , and a complex-conjugate pair of poles at , plotted above.\n\nThe gain is then\n\nThe phase is\n\nThe group delay is\n\nThe Taylor series expansion of the group delay is\n\nNote that the two terms in \"ω\" and \"ω\" are zero, resulting in a very flat group delay at . This is the greatest number of terms that can be set to zero, since there are a total of four coefficients in the third order Bessel polynomial, requiring four equations in order to be defined. One equation specifies that the gain be unity at and a second specifies that the gain be zero at , leaving two equations to specify two terms in the series expansion to be zero. This is a general property of the group delay for a Bessel filter of order \"n\": the first terms in the series expansion of the group delay will be zero, thus maximizing the flatness of the group delay at .\n\nAs the important characteristic of a Bessel filter is its maximally-flat group delay, and not the amplitude response, it is inappropriate to use the bilinear transform to convert the analog Bessel filter into a digital form (since this preserves the amplitude response but not the group delay).\n\nThe digital equivalent is the Thiran filter, also an all-pole low-pass filter with maximally-flat group delay, which can also be transformed into an allpass filter, to implement fractional delays.\n\n\n"}

Developed by Imagineering, the side-scrolling game features Bart Simpson on a comic book quest to rescue his kidnapped idol, superhero Radioactive Man. \"Bartman Meets Radioactive Man\" received generally negative reviews from critics, with criticism being directed at the gameplay control.\n\nAt the beginning of \"Bartman Meets Radioactive Man\", Bart Simpson is at home reading a \"Radioactive Man\" comic book only to be shocked as Radioactive Man's sidekick, Fallout Boy, jumps out of it. Fallout Boy tells Bart that he must venture into the comic book universe in order to save Radioactive Man, who is being held captive at the black hole-orbiting prison Limbo Zone. Once inside the comic book world, Bart transforms into his superhero alter ego Bartman and has to defeat three super villains that have stolen Radioactive Man's powers: Swamp Hag, Dr. Crab, and Lava Man. After collecting these powers, Bartman must find Radioactive Man and team up with him to defeat Brain-O the Magnificent, the mastermind behind the evil plot.\n\n\"Bartman Meets Radioactive Man\" is a side-scrolling platform game. Throughout the four chapters, Bartman is faced with enemies he has to defeat. He only has five life points, but if he loses one or more of them they can be restored. This is done by collecting radioactive signs. The player is able to collect lightning icons that give Bartman the ability to shoot lightning bolts at enemies from his eyes. His other weapons are kicking and punching. In addition, Bartman must avoid the deadly traps that are scattered at various places in the levels.\n\nAt the end of each chapter, Bartman must face one of the super villains that stole Radioactive Man's powers. \n\nThe game was developed by Imagineering and published by Acclaim. It was released in 1992 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the hand-held Sega Game Gear. At the time when the game was released, the \"Bartman\" alter ego was popular in merchandise relating to \"The Simpsons\", although the character rarely appeared in the television series.

He wrote that the game starts in a \"promising manner,\" but quickly \"degenerates\" into a generic platforming game, concluding with \"It would be easy to ignore \"Bart Meets Radioactive Man\", and, if you did, you wouldn't miss out on much. But if you can cope with boring graphics and monotone tunes, you have a tough game that should take a while to complete.\"\n\nIn 2009, 1UP.com editor Bob Mackey reviewed the game in 1UP's official Retro Gaming Blog. He wrote that Bart \"still has the same awful, inconsistent jumping from his first NES game. [...] Really, this game could have been somewhat interesting if the developers used the Radioactive Man character to parody existing comics and comic eras—as they did in the show and the \"Radioactive Man\" comic book—but that's asking way too much of a licensed 8-bit game.\"\n\nWriting for Tribune Media Services in 1993, columnists Chip and Jonathan Carter gave \"Bartman Meets Radioactive Man\" a more positive review. They wrote that \"we haven't seen a bad \"Simpsons\" game yet, and \"Bartman\"s actions and graphics are as good as the others. This one-player cart's not quite as much fun as the first two NES \"Simpsons\" games — probably because it's harder — but it still stands mask and cape above most other 8-bit games.\" The game received a 70/100 rating from the Dutch magazine \"Power Unlimited\" in 1994.\n"}

Walker Jr.\n\nJohn Mercer Walker Jr. (born December 26, 1940) is a Senior United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He served as Chief Judge from September 30, 2000, to September 30, 2006, when he assumed senior status. He was a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, appointed in 1985 by President Ronald Reagan before being elevated to the Second Circuit in 1989.\n\nWalker was born in New York City. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1958, and received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University in 1962. He received his Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1966.\n\nWalker is married to Katharine K. Walker, has a daughter and three stepsons, and lives in Madison, Connecticut. He is the son of Dr. John M. Walker and Elsie Louise Mead. His uncle is George Herbert Walker Jr., co-founder of the New York Mets. He is a first cousin of United States President George H. W. Bush, the two having a grandfather in common, George Herbert Walker. His father's sister, Dorothy, was the mother of the 41st President. He is also a first cousin once removed (common paternal uncle), of President George W. Bush and his brother, former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush.\n\nWalker served in the Marine Corps Reserves from 1963 until 1968. From 1966 until 1968, he was State Counsel to the Republic of Botswana, sponsored by an Africa-Asia Public Service Fellowship, where he drafted a codification of tribal law and was the country's principal prosecutor in the regular (non-tribal) criminal courts.\n\nWalker was in private practice in New York City from 1969 to 1970. From 1970 to 1975 he served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Criminal Division in the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, where he prosecuted drugs and business fraud cases. In 1975 he returned to private law practice with the New York firm of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, where he was a partner in commercial litigation.\n\nIn 1981 Walker became Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, responsible for policy in law enforcement, regulatory, and trade matters, and with oversight of the Customs Service, Secret Service, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control. As Assistant Secretary, he helped establish the Iran–United States Claims Tribunal and served as a U.S. representative to Interpol. He led the development of Treasury's drug interdiction and financial enforcement programs. He also oversaw the Treasury's review of Secret Service operations following the attempt to assassinate President Ronald Reagan. Among the shortcomings of the Secret Service that the review identified and remedied were inadequate reserve personnel and the use of unencrypted radio communications. For his Treasury service, Walker received the Alexander Hamilton Award, Treasury's highest award. His work caught the attention of New York Senator Alphonse D'Amato who supported him for the position of district judge.\n\nWalker was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on June 25, 1985, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by Judge Morris E. Lasker. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 19, 1985, and received commission on July 22, 1985. His service terminated on December 19, 1989, due to elevation to the Second Circuit. He was succeeded by Judge Sonia Sotomayor. As a district judge, Walker presided over a variety of civil and criminal proceedings, including notably the 1989 tax fraud trial of billionaire hotel magnate Leona Helmsley, whom he sentenced to four years in jail.\n\nWalker was nominated by President George H. W. Bush on September 21, 1989, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated by Judge Irving Kaufman. He was confirmed by the Senate on November 22, 1989, and received his commission on November 27, 1989. He served as Chief Judge from September 30, 2000 to September 30, 2006. He assumed senior status on September 30, 2006. He was succeeded by Judge Debra Ann Livingston.\n\nWalker was awarded the Learned Hand Medal for \"excellence in Federal Jurisprudence\" by the Federal Bar Council and in 2006 the Robert L. Haig Award for \"distinguished public service\" by the New York State Bar Association, and the J. Edward Lumbard Award for \"outstanding service\" by the Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nWalker has served as Special Counsel to the U.S. Administrative Conference (1987–1992) and president of the Federal Judges' Association (1993–1995). As chief judge, Walker was engaged with all three levels of federal court administration. He led the Court of Appeals, chaired the Second Circuit Judicial Council with responsibility for all of the courts within the Second Circuit (consisting of the states of Connecticut, New York, and Vermont), and on the national level was a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States, chaired by the Chief Justice of the United States (2000-2006). He was also selected by Chief Justice William Rehnquist to be a member of the Conference's Executive Committee (2003-2006) and its Budget Committee (1990-1999). He was selected by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., to be a member of its Committee on International Judicial Relations (2006-2012), and to be the Chair of the Conference's Committee on Judicial Conduct and Disability (2009-2013). As Chief Judge of the Second Circuit, Walker managed the dislocations from the courthouse at 40 Foley Square in lower Manhattan caused by the terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001, oversaw the establishment by Judge Jon O. Newman of a separate calendar for a sudden crush of 5,000 immigration appeals in 2005, and obtained funding for the total renovation of the Thurgood Marshall Courthouse at 40 Foley Square which was completed under the supervision of Chief Judge Walker and his successor, Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs.\n\nWalker has authored several hundred decisions in various areas of federal law including influential precedents in the areas of constitutional law, criminal law, criminal and civil procedure, securities law, bankruptcy law, intellectual property law, and international law, including the following selected appeals.\n\n\n\n\n\nWalker is a strong advocate of judicial independence for both courts in the United States and in other countries. He has condemned the growing politicization of the judicial nomination and confirmation process for federal judges. The \"political theater\" that judicial nominees are subjected to in the Senate, he writes, \"politicizes the judiciary, misrepresents the judiciary's role in our democracy, demeans highly qualified nominees, and unjustifiably delays or jettisons confirmations.\" An independent judge, in his view, is one who faithfully applies existing law to the facts of the case at hand, giving due respect to precedent, and resists the temptation to effectively rewrite legislative enactments. The independent judge \"must remain detached and impartial -- and free not merely from personal or financial interests\" but also free of \"any responsibility to party or social faction\" and \"must not be concerned with whether an outcome will incur public approbation or wrath.\"\n\nSince 2000, Walker has been a Lecturer in Law at Yale Law School, where he has taught constitutional litigation with fellow Second Circuit judges Guido Calabresi and Susan L. Carney and with district judges Mark Kravitz and Jeffrey Meyer.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2000, Walker was an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law and a member of NYU's Institute of Judicial Administration and Appellate Judges Seminar. He has also served on the Board of the U.S. Association of Constitutional Law since 1997 and the CEELI Institute in Prague since 2006.\n\nWalker is actively involved in initiatives to promote the rule of law, strengthen judiciaries and foster cooperation among judges around the world, especially in Eastern and Central Europe, China and the Middle East. He was a member of the U.S. delegation to the G8 Experts Conference on the Rule of Law in Berlin in 2007.\n\nWalker has worked across Central and Eastern Europe to promote the development of judicial institutions in individual countries and to foster collaboration among judiciaries across the region and the United States. In 2011, he was instrumental in organizing the first Conference of the Chief Justices of Central and Eastern Europe, hosted by the CEELI Institute in Prague, which was attended by the chief justices, presidents and high officers of the supreme courts that region of the world. Chief Justice of the United States John G. Roberts, Jr. delivered the opening remarks and participated in the first conference. The Conference, now an ongoinsg institution that meets annually in a different member country, provides a unique forum for the heads of judiciaries of 24 former communist countries to share their experiences, discuss problems and offer solutions, while developing ongoing personal relationships.\n\nThe Chief Justices Conference arose out of CEELI's Judicial Integrity Round Tables. In 2006, while on a trip to Hungary, Walker saw a need for closer communication among the chief justices of Central and Eastern European countries. He then led the roundtable discussions on judicial integrity among the heads of the Supreme Court in the region at the CEELI Institute in Prague in 2007 and 2010. At the 2010 roundtable, the participants expressed a desire to hold regular conferences on an ongoing basis. After the first Chief Justices Conference in 2011, Walker has represented the Ceeli Institute and remained an advisor to the Conference. He helped plan and participated in subsequent Chief Justice Conferences hosted in Albania (2012), Montenegro (2013), Georgia (2014), Croatia (2015), Serbia (2016),Hungary (2017), Lithuania (2018) and Slovakia (2019). Since 2013, the Russian Federation has actively participated in the work of the Conference.\n\nWalker began working on issues of legal reform and judicial administration in Eastern Europe in 2004 when Chief Justice of Albania Thimjo Kondi sought assistance with the administration of the Albanian judiciary. Walker made multiple trips to Albania to assist with the establishment of a judicial conference modeled upon that of the U.S. federal judiciary and to teach judicial ethics. He has discussed legal reform issues with Presidents Alfred Moisiu and Bamir Topi and prime ministers Fatos Nano and Sali Berisha. He worked with Kondi's successor, Chief Justice Shpresa Beçaj, to host the second Chief Justices Conference in Tirana in 2012. President Moisiu awarded Judge Walker the \"Medal of Special Merit\" for his work in Albania.\n\nElsewhere in Eastern Europe, Walker has discussed law reform issues with leaders in various countries where he has also given remarks and met with law school faculty and students, bar associations and judges. In 2008 he helped organize a conference on rule of law and law school accreditation in Georgia where he discussed rule of law issues with President Mikheil Saakashvili, having worked on law reform the previous year with Chief Justice of the Georgian Supreme Court Konstantin Kublashvili.\n\nSince 1986, Walker has been active in rule of law programs and exchanges with China. He has participated in exchanges with Chinese judges in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Xiamen and Haikou. He has lectured or spoken on U.S. law and rule of law topics in Beijing at the National Judges College, National Prosecutors College, Peking University, Renmin University, China University of Political Science and Law, and Beijing Normal University; in Shanghai at Fudan University, East China University of Political Science and Law and at the joint China program of Zhejiang University Guanghua Law School and Thomas Jefferson Law School in Hangzhou.\n\nHe has conferred on issues of legal reform with Chinese officials including President of the Supreme People's Court (SPC) Xiao Yang, SPC vice-president Wan Exiang, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Cao Jianming, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Huang Mengfu, and Director of the State Council Information Office Wang Chen. In 2002, he helped arrange with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor a judicial delegation to meet in Beijing with the Supreme People's Court to discuss problems of local protectionism by courts and accompanied Justice O'Connor to a meeting with President of China Jiang Zemin in Zhongnanhai. In 2009, working with China law expert Professor Jerome Cohen and other American scholars and judges, Walker led the American delegation at the inaugural Sino-American Dialogue on the Rule of Law and Human Rights, a Track II dialogue co-sponsored by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations and the China Foundation for Human Rights Development, in Nantong and thereafter in other venues. More recently, working with experts at Yale and Stanford and with the Supreme People's Court, he has participated in workshops in China and submitted papers to support a system of precedent in China, known as the \"Guiding Cases System,\" under the auspices of the Supreme People's Court.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Walker participated in rule of law programs in 2010 in Thailand and in 2012 in South Korea where he met with the Chief Justices of the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court and with judges and law students and faculty.\n\nWalker spoke at \"Arab Judicial Forum 2003: Judicial Systems in the 21st Century,\" a conference on judicial reform in the Middle East that was held in Bahrain in 2003 and attended by 17 countries, and the \"Regional Forum on the Role of Civil Society in Promoting the Rule of Law in the Arab Region\" held in Jordan in 2008. He has also been engaged with training programs for Iraqi officials and judges held in Iraq, Jordan and Bahrain. He has conferred with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Iraq, Medhat al-Mahmoud, on issues relating to the rule of law and human rights.\n\nFatal traffic accident\n\nOn the evening of October 17, 2006, while driving home, Walker's Ford Escape automobile struck a police officer, Daniel Picagli, who was directing traffic in a rainstorm at a road construction site for AT&T in New Haven, Connecticut. There were no construction signs or traffic cones marking off the site. Picagli died four days later on October 21, 2006. \"He had been wearing a black raincoat and a reflective vest\". Police Chief Francisco Ortiz said the \"officers did not feel it was necessary to test Walker for drugs or alcohol\". Walker stopped immediately, and New Haven police have said the cause was not related to drugs or alcohol. A police investigation reported that Walker \"was traveling at a slow speed through the dark and rainy construction site.\" The prosecutor declined to press charges, saying nothing indicated \"intentional, negligent or reckless conduct\" by Walker.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Among his works were a contribution to the ex-Communist treatise \"The God that Failed\" (1949), a \"Life of Mahatma Gandhi\" (1950), basis for the Academy Award-winning film \"Gandhi\" (1982), as well as a \"Life of Lenin\", which won the 1965 National Book Award in History and Biography.\n\nLouis Fischer, the son of a fish peddler, was born in Philadelphia on 29 February 1896. After studying at the Philadelphia School of Pedagogy from 1914 to 1916, he became a school teacher.\n\nIn 1917, Fischer joined the Jewish Legion, a military unit based in Palestine. On his return to the United States, Fischer took up work at a news agency in New York City and met Bertha \"Markoosha\" Mark (1890?-1977). In 1921, when Bertha went to work in Berlin, Fischer joined her a few months later and began contributing to the \"New York Evening Post\" as a European correspondent. The following year, he moved to Moscow and married Bertha. In 1923 their first son George was born (followed by Victor a year later) and Fisher began working for \"The Nation\".\n\nWhile in the Soviet Union, Fischer published several books including \"Oil Imperialism: The International Struggle for Petroleum\" (1926) and \"The Soviets in World Affairs\" (1930).\n\nIn 1934, American Max Eastman criticized Fischer for Stalinism in a chapter called \"The 'Revolution' of April 23, 1932\" in his book \"Artists in Uniform\". In 1938, Leon Trotsky described Fischer as a \"merchant of lies\" and \"direct literary agent of Stalin\".\n\nFischer also covered the Spanish Civil War and for a time was a member of the International Brigade fighting General Francisco Franco. In 1938, he returned to the United States and settled in New York. He continued to work for \"The Nation\" and wrote his autobiography, \"Men and Politics\" (1941).\n\nFischer left \"The Nation\" in 1945 after a dispute with the editor, Freda Kirchwey, over the journal's sympathetic reporting of Joseph Stalin. His disillusionment with Communism, although he had never been a member of the Communist Party USA, was reflected in his contribution to \"The God That Failed\" (1949). Fischer began writing for anti-Communist liberal magazines such as \"The Progressive\". Louis Fischer taught about the Soviet Union at Princeton University until his death on January 15, 1970.\n\nFischer traveled to Ukraine in October and November 1932, for \"The Nation\", and was alarmed at what he saw. \"In the Poltava, Vinnitsa, Podolia and Kiev regions, conditions will be hard,\" he wrote, \"I think there is no starvation anywhere in Ukraine now — after all they have just gathered in the harvest, but it was a bad harvest.\"\n\nInitially critical of the Soviet grain procurement program because it created the food problem, Fischer by February 1933 adopted the official Soviet government view, which blamed the problem on Ukrainian counter-revolutionary nationalist \"wreckers.\" It seemed \"whole villages\" had been \"contaminated\" by such men, who had to be deported to \"lumbering camps and mining areas in distant agricultural areas which are now just entering upon their pioneering stage.\" These steps were forced upon the Kremlin, Fischer wrote, but the Soviets were, nevertheless, learning how to rule wisely.\n\nFischer was on a lecture tour in the United States when Gareth Jones' famine story broke. Speaking to a college audience in Oakland, California, a week later, Fischer stated emphatically: \"There is no starvation in Russia.\" He spent the spring of 1933 campaigning for American diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union. As rumors of a famine in the USSR reached American shores, Fischer vociferously denied the reports.\n\nIn January 2009, on the occasion of the 112th birth anniversary of Subhas Chandra Bose, Italian ambassador to India Alessandro Quaroni stated that there was no point in continuing research on whether Bose died in a plane crash or not in August 1945. In a statement issued against this remark, Mission Netaji, a Delhi based non-profit trust stated that there was evidence which held that Bose did not die in any plane crash. Mission Netaji cited reference to a note by Louis Fischer, which is preserved in the Princeton University Library. The note quotes the former Italian ambassador Pietro Quaroni, father of Alessandro Quaroni, as saying that he did not think the news of Bose's accidental death was true. Fischer had met Pietro Quaroni in Moscow in November 1946 and quoted him saying it was possible \"that Bose is still alive\". Quaroni had told Fischer that Bose did not want the British to look for him, so the false rumor of his death was circulated.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2071225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071225", "title": "Architectural conservation", "text": "Architectural conservation\n\nArchitectural conservation describes the process through which the material, historical, and design integrity of any built heritage are prolonged through carefully planned interventions. The individual engaged in this pursuit is known as an architectural conservator-restorer. Decisions of when and how to engage in an intervention are critical to the ultimate conservation-restoration of cultural heritage. Ultimately, the decision is value based: a combination of artistic, contextual, and informational values is normally considered. In some cases, a decision to not intervene may be the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe Conservation Architect must consider factors that deal with issues of prolonging the life and preserving the integrity of architectural character, such as form and style, and/or its constituent materials, such as stone, brick, glass, metal, and wood. In this sense, the term refers to the \"professional use of a combination of science, art, craft, and technology as a preservation tool\" and is allied with – and often equated to – its parent fields, of historic environment conservation and art conservation.\n\nIn addition to the design and art/science definition described above, architectural conservation also refers to issues of identification, policy, regulation, and advocacy associated with the entirety of the cultural and built environment. This broader scope recognizes that society has mechanisms to identify and value historic cultural resources, create laws to protect these resources, and develop policies and management plans for interpretation, protection, and education. Typically this process operates as a specialized aspect of a society's planning system, and its practitioners are termed built or historic environment conservation professionals.\n\nArchitectural conservation is the process by which individuals or groups attempt to protect valued buildings from unwanted change.\n\nAs a movement, architectural conservation in general, and the preservation of ancient structures specifically, gained momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was a response to Modernism and its corresponding architectural perspective, which eschewed sentimental attachment to old buildings and structures in favor of technological and architectural progress and change. Prior to this time most of the ancient buildings that were still standing had only survived because they either had significant cultural or religious import, or they had yet to be discovered.\n\nThe growth of the architectural conservation movement took place at a time of significant archaeological discovery and scientific advancement. Those educated in the field began to see various examples of architecture as either being \"correct\" or \"incorrect\". Because of this, two schools of thought began to emerge within the field of building conservation.\n\nPreservation/Conservation were used interchangeably to refer to the architectural school of thought that either encouraged measures that would protect and maintain buildings in their current state, or would prevent further damage and deterioration to them. This school of thought saw the original design of old buildings as correct in and of themselves. Two of the main proponents of preservation and conservation in the 19th century were art critic John Ruskin and artist William Morris.\n\nRestoration was the conservationist school of thought that believed historic buildings could be improved, and sometimes even completed, using current day materials, design, and techniques. In this way it is very similar to the Modernist architectural theory, except it does not advocate the destruction of ancient structures. One of the most ardent supporters of this school of thought in the 19th century was the French architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. Victorian restoration of medieval churches was widespread in England and elsewhere, with results that were deplored at the time by William Morris and are now widely regretted.\n\nThe Department of the Interior of the United States defined the following treatment approaches to architectural conservation:\n\n\nOther nations recognize some or all of these as potential treatments for historic structures. Canada recognizes preservation, rehabilitation, and restoration. The Burra Charter, for Australia, identifies preservation, restoration, and reconstruction.\n\nThe earliest building materials used by ancient peoples, such as wood and mud, were organic. Organic materials were used because they were plentiful and renewable. Unfortunately, the organic materials used were also very susceptible to the two most significant impediments to preservation and conservation: the elements and life (both human and animal). Over time inorganic materials like brick, stone, metal, concrete, and terra cotta began to be used by ancient people instead of organic ones, due to their durability. In fact, we know that these materials are durable because many ancient structures that are composed of them, even some built as far back as the Bronze Age, like Egypt's Great Pyramids, still stand today.\n\nAncient buildings such as the Egyptian pyramids, the Roman Colosseum, and the Parthenon face common preservation issues. The most prominent factors affecting these structures are the environment, pollution, and tourism.\n\nAs the Earth's climate patterns change, so too do the environmental conditions governing these buildings. For example, the Colosseum has already faced lightning, fire, and earthquakes. The changing climate increases the accumulation of salt crystals on the outside of monuments like the Colosseum and the Parthenon. This phenomenon increases the deterioration of these buildings.\n\nThe salt crystals further contribute to the black effect that man-made pollution has on these buildings. The Parthenon is especially exposed and many of the remaining marbles are eroding to the point that they may no longer be identifiable. The pollution from corrosive agents in the air has also attributed to this deterioration.\n\nThe third factor affecting ancient building conservation is tourism. While tourism provides both economical and cultural benefits, it can also be destructive. The Egyptian tomb of Seti the 1st is currently off limits to the public due to the deterioration that has been caused by tourists. The pyramids in Giza have also encountered problems due to large numbers of tourists; more tourists mean greater humidity and water presence, which can lead to erosion.\n\nAll of the above factors complicate the conservation options available to treat these buildings.\nThe first step in any building conservation project is a sensitive assessment of its history and merits. As noted architect Donald Insall states, \"Every building has its own biography. A knowledge of the whole life of a building brings an essential understanding of its features and its problems. He gives the Parthenon in Athens as an example; built between 447 and 432 BCE to serve as a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, its purpose over time changed to Christian church, mosque, and powder magazine before it became one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world.\n\nOnce the assessment is complete, the next step is a thorough measured survey with a tape, rod and level. Modern measuring techniques, such as photogrammetry (the use of aerial photographs to make maps and surveys) and stereophotogrammetry, are also used today to increase accuracy. Once the measurements are complete, there is an analysis of the structural stability of the building and its living pattern of movement. No building is permanently still; soil and wind can affect building stability and need to be documented. Finally, the architect or surveyor tests the electrical connections, plumbing, and other utilities present in the building (this is more for historic and re-purposed buildings). For both ancient and historic buildings, lightning conductors and fire-fighting equipment are checked to make sure they can provide sufficient protection.\n\nAt the end of this assessment process, the conservator will analyze all the collected data and decide on a conservation plan based on available funding sources..\n\nThe phrase covers a wide span of activities, from the cleaning of the interior or exterior of a building — as took place at St Paul's Cathedral in London — to the rebuilding of damaged or derelict buildings, such as the restoration of the Windsor Great Hall in Windsor Castle after a destructive fire in 1992. The 1985–1989 removal of 38 layers of paint and the cleaning and repair of the exterior sandstone walls of the White House in the United States are an example of building restoration.\n\nBuildings are structures which have, from time to time, particular purposes. They require ongoing maintenance to prevent them falling into disrepair as a result of the ravages of time and use. Building restoration can be thought of as that set of activities which are greater than year-to-year maintenance, but which by retaining the building are less than a demolition and the construction of a new building.\nNot all building conservation seeks to follow the original design of the building. It is reasonably commonplace for the shell of a building — its external walls — to be retained whilst an entirely new building is constructed within. This approach is also referred to as adaptive reuse.\n\nAlthough techniques of architectural conservation are improving, the action of cleaning or repairing buildings can, with hindsight, be seen to cause problems that at the time were unforeseen. A good example is the unrestrained use of sandblasting to clean smog deposits from soft-stoned buildings — a technique employed in the UK in the 1960s and 1970s — which has damaged the external faces of stonework to the extent that in some cases, later, the stonework has needed to be replaced. Contemporary building codes recognize such problems, and (it is to be hoped) mitigate poor outcomes.\n\nMost ancient buildings are constructed of stone and have survived from antiquity as a result of the stability of this building material. However, stone can deteriorate rapidly without protection, particularly in our modern era of pollution and climate change.\n\nThere are many organizations that work to raise public awareness of the necessity to preserve ancient and historic buildings and areas, across communities, users and government. In addition to promoting the cultural value of these buildings, and encouraging appropriate policies and strategies for conservation, the organizations can help in raising the required funding to implement conservation initiatives and plans, and often serve as a link between the community and local/federal governments to advance conservation projects. A brief list of architectural conservation organizations is below:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was made famous by the Battle of Cable Street in 1936.\n\nCable Street starts near the edge of London's financial district the City of London in south-western Whitechapel and continues on through to central Shadwell and then to south-eastern Stepney where the junction between Cable Street and Butcher Row in Limehouse. The street is parallel to, and south of, the Docklands Light Railway and Commercial Road, and north of The Highway.\n\nThe area is close to Wapping and Shadwell Basin to the south, Tower Hill to the west, and Aldgate to the north. Since many Londoners define their locality by the nearest London Underground stations, the Cable Street area is often referred to as Shadwell.\n\nThe street is in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, in postal district E1. It lies within the parliamentary constituencies of Bethnal Green and Bow and Poplar and Limehouse, currently represented by Rushanara Ali and Jim Fitzpatrick, both of the Labour party.\n\nCable Street started as a straight path along which hemp ropes were twisted into ships' cables (i.e. ropes). These supplied the many ships that would anchor in the nearby Pool of London, between London Bridge and Wapping and Rotherhithe. Many other \"rope walks\" can be seen on later maps, showing how demand for ropes grew as shipping increased.\n\nUntil Victorian times, the current Cable Street had different names for each of its sections. From west to east these ran: Cable Street, Knock Fergus, New Road, Back Lane, Blue Gate Fields, Sun Tavern Fields, and Brook Street. Knock Fergus may have been a reference to the large numbers of Irish residents there then, but the name is old – it is found in the St. Dunstan Stepney registers in the early 1600s. Also, in the 19th century, the area at the western end of Cable Street was identified as \"near Wellclose Square\", as this was a well-known landmark, where nautical items were sold. The whole of the central area of the current street was named after St. George in the East church and St. George in the East parish.\n\nFrom Victorian times through to the 1950s, Cable Street had a reputation for cheap lodgings, brothels, drinking inns and opium dens.\n\nThe last occasion in England when a stake was hammered through a sinner’s heart at an official burial, took place at the junction of Cable Street and Cannon Street Road: John Williams was found hanged in his cell, after being arrested as a suspect in the Ratcliff Highway murders. Local people went along with the claim that he had committed suicide, from guilt of the crimes. At the time, 1812, suicide was considered to be sinful, and justified him being buried upside down with a stake through his heart. His skull was found when new gas mains were being laid in August 1886, and was on display for many years in The Crown and Dolphin pub opposite.\nOn 4 October 1936 a violent confrontation between the Metropolitan Police and local communities on the street was later named the 'Battle of Cable Street'. Communist, anarchist, labour and Jewish groups joined with locals to resist a planned march through the East End by Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists. The East End has traditionally been an area of London with a large Jewish population. It is estimated that around 100,000 Jews from Eastern Europe had fled to the East End in the period 1881–1914. A bus was overturned and used as a barricade, Mosley's car was attacked with bricks, and there was some of the most violent hand-to-hand fighting ever seen in London. The march was eventually abandoned. A large mural (created between 1979 and 1983) on St. George's Town Hall, next to Library Place, depicts scenes from the day. A red plaque at Cable Street's junction with Dock Street commemorates the incident.\n\nListed from west to east:\n\n\nVehicular traffic is restricted to travel one-way along the whole street, though the direction varies. It is mostly west-bound, but it is east-bound east of Brodlove Lane (itself one-way north-bound). It lies outside of the London congestion charge zone (CCZ).\n\nLondon Cycle Superhighway 3 runs the length of Cable Street in the form of a two-way segregated cycle track, continuing west into Royal Mint Street (its western terminus). This is well used by cyclists, especially those commuting to the City and Docklands.\n\n\nLondon Buses routes 100 and D3 both pass west-bound through the central part of Cable Street: \n\nThe district falls within Transport for London's Travelcard zone 2. The nearest London Underground station is Tower Hill. Opened in 2010, the nearest London Overground stations are Shadwell and Wapping on the East London Line.\n\nThe nearest Docklands Light Railway stations are Shadwell and Limehouse (also a National Rail station).\n\nPeople associated with the area:\n\nMembers of Parliament, for Bethnal Green and Bow:\n\nMembers of Parliament, for Poplar and Canning Town:\n\n\n\n\n\nWest of Cable Street\n\n\nNorth of Cable Street starting from the west:\n\n\nEast of Cable Street\n\n\nSouth of Cable Street, starting from the west:\n\n\nAs Cable Street refers to the fact that originally cables (and such) were made here, often for the maritime industry, it is a name (and similar names) which can be found in other places (which often have a maritime history):\n\n"}
{"id": "2071240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071240", "title": "Culture of Azerbaijan", "text": "Culture of Azerbaijan\n\nThe Culture of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan mədəniyyəti) developed under the influence of Iranian, Turkic and Caucasian heritage as well as Russian influences due to its former status as a Soviet republic. Today, western influences, including globalized consumer culture, are prevalent.\n\nAzerbaijan is the modern name of a historical and geographic region on the border of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, and formerly known as Aran or Ardan by various Persian Empires, or by Albania by Greeks. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia's Daghestan region to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia and Turkey to the southwest, and Iran to the south. Azerbaijan is a home to diverse ethnicities, majority of which are Azeris, an ethnic group which numbers to 10 million in the independent Republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe heritage, culture, and civilization of this region today known as the country of Azerbaijan has both ancient and modern roots. The people of the modern country of Azerbaijan are believed to be inheritors of various ancient civilizations and peoples, including the indigenous Caucasian Albanians tribes such as Scythians and Alans, and the later arrival of Oghuz Turks, among others (note that several modern peoples of the Caucasus can trace their ancestries to more than one of these same ancient peoples).\n\nCaucasian Albanians are believed to be the earliest inhabitants of the land above the Aras river today known as Azerbaijan. Early invaders included the Iranian Scythians in the 9th century BCE. The South Caucasus was eventually fully assimilated and conquered by the Persian Achaemenids around 550 BCE. Zoroastrianism was already prevalent among the Medes in the lands below and above the Aras river, and long before the Acheamenids assimilated these lands into the eventual empire. The Achaemenids in turn were defeated by Alexander the Great in 330 BCE. Following the decline of the Seleucids in Persia in 247 BCE and the succession by the Parthians, the Caucasian Albanians established a kingdom in the 1st century BCE and largely remained independent under Parthian rule, until the Sassanids made the kingdom a province in 252 CE. Caucasian Albania's ruler, King Urnayr, officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century CE, and Albania would remain a Christian state until the 8th century. Sassanid control ended with their defeat by Muslim Arabs in 642 CE, through the Muslim conquest of Persia.\n\nWell before Islam arrived in the region, the region above the Aras river today known as Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia, was for centuries under Sassanid Iranian rule, and before that under Parthian Iranian rule. Muslim Arabs defeated the Sassanids and Byzantines as they marched into the Caucasus region. The Arabs made Caucasian Albania a vassal state after the Christian resistance, led by Prince Javanshir, surrendered in 667. Between the 9th and 10th centuries, Arab authors continued to refer to the region between the Kura and Aras rivers as \"Arran\". During this time, Arabs from Basra and Kufa came to Aran and seized lands that the indigenous peoples had abandoned; the Arabs became a land-owning elite. Despite pockets of continued resistance, the majority of the inhabitants of Azerbaijan converted to Islam. Later on in the 10th and 11th centuries, Kurdish dynasties of Shaddadid and Rawadid ruled parts of Aran.\n\nThe Seljuq period of Azerbaijan's history was possibly even more pivotal than the Arab conquest as it helped shape the ethno-linguistic nationality of the modern Azerbaijani Turks.\n\nAfter decline of Abbasid Khalifate, the territory of Azerbaijan was under the sway of numerous Iranian dynasties such as the Salarids, Sajids, and Shaddadids. However at the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of Oghuz Turkic tribes emanating from Central Asia. The first of these Turkic dynasties was the Ghaznavids from present-day northern Afghanistan, who took over part of Azerbaijan by 1030. They were followed by the Seljuqs, a western branch of the Oghuz who conquered all of Iran and the Caucasus and pressed on to Iraq where they overthrew the Buyids in Baghdad in 1055.\n\nShīrwān Shāh or Sharwān Shāh, was the title in medieval Islamic times of Azerbaijani people. The Shirvanshah established a dynasty that ruled over the Aran region (present-day Azerbaijan Republic) as well as parts of Dagestan, and were rulers of Shirvan, a historical region in present-day Azerbaijan Republic. The Shirvanshahs established the longest Islamic dynasty in the Islamic world.\n\nThe Safavid (Safaviyeh) were a Sufi religious order formed in the 1330s by Sheikh Safi-ad-din Ardabili (1252–1334), after whom it was eponymously named.\n\nThis Sufi order openly converted to the heterodox branch of twelver Shi'a Islam by the end of the 15th century. Some Safavid followers, most notably the Qizilbash Turks, believed in the mystical and esoteric nature of their rulers and their relationship to the house of Ali, and thus, were zealously predisposed to fight for them. The Safavid rulers claimed to be descended from Ali himself and his wife Fatimah, daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, through the seventh Imam Musa al-Kazim. Qizilbash numbers increased by the 16th century and their generals were able to wage a successful war against the Ak Koyunlu state and capture Tabriz.\n\nThe Safavids, led by Ismail I, expanded their base, sacking Baku in 1501 and persecuting the Shirvanshahs.\n\nThe region of Aran had been under subsequent Persian-based empires since millennia, with the last one being the Qajar dynasty. Following their defeat by Imperial Russia, Qajar Persia was forced to sign the Treaty of Gulistan in 1813, which acknowledged the loss of the territory of Aran (today known as the country of Azerbaijan), Dagestan, and Georgia to Russia. Local khanates were either abolished (like in Baku or Ganja) or accepted Russian patronage. Another Russo-Persian war in 1826-28, while starting off with a loss for the Russians, eventually resulted in the final crushing defeat for the Iranian army. The Russians dictated another final settlement as per the Treaty of Turkmenchay, which resulted in the Qajars of Persia officially ceding all their Caucasian territories in 1828. The treaty established the current borders of Tsarist Russia and Iran. and divided the Azerbaijani people between two nations; Iran and Azerbaijan. Until 1918, the region was still known as Aran, until the Mussavatis, renamed the region as Azerbaijan, resembling the historical name of the Iranian province of Azarbaijan. In the Russian-controlled territories, two provinces were established that later constituted the bulk of the modern Republic - Elisavetpol (Ganja) province in the west, and Shamakha province in the east.\n\nAt the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, an independent republic was proclaimed in Tbilisi on May 28, 1918 following an abortive attempt to establish a federal Transcaucasian Republic with Armenia and Georgia. This was the first Democratic Republic established in Islamic World.\n\nAmong the important accomplishments of the Parliament was the extension of suffrage to women, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim state in the world to give women equal political rights with men. In this accomplishment, Azerbaijan preceded even such developed countries as the United Kingdom and the United States. Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University, which was the first modern-type university founded in Azerbaijan.\n\nArchitecture in the country of Azerbaijan typically combines elements of East and West. Many ancient architectural treasures such as the Maiden Tower and Palace of the Shirvanshahs in the walled city of Baku are old Iranian architecture, and survive in modern country of Azerbaijan.\nAmong other medieval architectural treasures reflecting the Iranian roots of architecture in the region are the Shirvan shahs' palace in Baku, the palace of the Shaki Khans in the town of Shaki in north-central Azerbaijan, the Surakhany Temple on the Apsheron Peninsula, a number of bridges spanning the Aras River, and several mausoleums. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, little monumental architecture was created, but distinctive residences were built in Baku and elsewhere. Among the most recent architectural monuments, the Baku subways are noted for their lavish decor.\n\nThe most typical distinguishing features of Azerbaijan's architecture in the 19th century were the expansion of towns, application of Russian town-planning principles and the development of the general layouts of Ganja, Shemakha and Baku.\n\nThe construction of advanced buildings, after Northern Azerbaijan was ceded to Russia, had a significant importance. New buildings such as theaters, schools, hospitals, and houses were constructed in the middle of the 19th century. The establishment and continuous development of capitalist relations produced a strong impact on the architectural development of Azerbaijan. The peculiarities of Azerbaijani architecture can easily be found in Baku buildings that were built during the period of oil industry development in the 19th-20th centuries. Baku was becoming one of the largest cities in Russia.\n\nThe first stage of the architectural development in Azerbaijan during the Soviet period was related the construction of the working settlements of Binagadi, Rasulzade, Bakikhanov, Montino, Mammadyarov around Baku. Working settlements in Absheron were the first examples of young Soviet architecture.\n\nA number of schools were built in Baku and other cities of Azerbaijan during 1933–1936. Four-storied buildings, constructed upon projects by S.Dadashov and M.Useynov in Baku and other towns of the country, distinguish for expressiveness of architectural solutions. Classic forms along with national architecture traditions are typical for these projects.\nThe projecting and construction of the Neft Dashlari (Oil Stones) - steel pillar settlements in the open sea - heralded the beginning of a new era in post-war architecture. The Neft Dashlari was built in connection with the discovery of rich oil fields in the Caspian Sea in 1949. This extraordinary settlement includes dwelling houses, cultural objects, overpasses, etc.\n\nThe new period in town-building and architectural development of Azerbaijan began in Azerbaijan in the 1960s. Baku, the capital of the Republic of Azerbaijan, grew into a large capital city during these years. This was also the time of erection of wonderful architectural ensembles and advanced buildings, which defined the city image.\n\nThe film industry in Azerbaijan dates back to 1898. In fact, Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in cinematography: it is not surprising that this new medium soon showed up in cosmopolitan \"nouveau-riche\" Baku at the turn of the 19th century.\n\nThe Azerbaijani cuisine, throughout the centuries, has been influenced by the foods of different cultures due to political and economic processes in Azerbaijan. Still, today's Azerbaijani cuisine has distinctive and unique features. Many foods that are indigenous to the country can now be seen in the cuisines of other cultures. For the Azerbaijanis, food is an important part of the country's culture and is deeply rooted in the history, traditions and values of the nation.\n\nEvery year a cultural festival is held in Goychay, Azerbaijan known as Pomegranate Festival. The festival features Azerbaijani fruit-cuisine mainly the pomegranates from Goychay. At the festival, a parade is held with traditional Azerbaijani dances and Azerbaijani music.\n\nThe Pomegranate Festival usually takes place in October.\n\nThere are a number of Azerbaijani dances, these folk dances of the Azerbaijani people are old and extremely melodious. It is performed at formal celebrations and the dancers wear festival clothes. It has a very fast rhythm, so the dancer must have inherent skill.\n\nAzerbaijan's national dance shows the characteristics of the Azerbaijani nation. These dances differ from other dances with its quick temp and optimism. And this talks about nation's braveness.\nThe national clothes of Azerbaijan are well preserved within the national dances.\n\nAbayi (Azerbaijani: \"Abayı\") is an Azerbaijani dance with its origins from Shaki and Zaqatala region of Az\n\nOver the ancient history of Azerbaijan the Azeris have created a rich and distinctive culture, a major part of which is decorative and applied art. This form of art rooted in hoary antiquity is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jeweler, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone and bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery. Each of these types of decorative art, evidence and endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very much in favor here. Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers and diplomats who had visited these places at different times.\n\nAzerbaijani rugs are a product of Azerbaijan, an ancient center of carpet weaving.\nAzerbaijan has been since the ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well developed agriculture, stock raising, metal working, pottery and ceramics, and last but not least carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC.\n\nAzerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups. The true scientific research of the Azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of Latif Kerimov, a prominent scientist and artist. It was his classification that related the four large groups of carpets with the four geographical zones of Azerbaijan, i.e. Guba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh and Tabriz.\n\nBaku carpets are marked for their increased softness of the material and intense colors, as well as excellent artistic taste and exquisite decoration. This school has about 10 compositions. The historical sources and inscriptions on the carpets testify to the fact that carpet making was widely spread in these villages and carpet-ware was exported outside the country. The carpet composition often includes medallions. They are filled by various motifs, most often by stylized images of plants, which lost their resemblance to the original object after they had been geometrized.\n\nThe carpets of Ganja are notable for peculiarity of their compositions and ornamental patterns. The Ganja carpets include a relatively small number of carpet compositions, all in all between 8 and 20 patterns. The Kazakh carpets cover about 16 compositions with various patterns. Kazakh, which is located on the NW of Azerbaijan, is the most famous carpet production region and also accounts for the Kazakh and Borchaly carpet groups. The Kazakh carpets have a geometrical ornamental pattern, the composition is not very complex with a focus on a schematic presentation of the geometrical patterns, plants and animals. The ornamental decor of the Ganja carpets is rich and diverse, with a focus on geometrical motifs as well as schematic presentation of plants and animals.\n\nThe Karabakh carpet is one of five major regional groups of carpets made in Azerbaijan named after the Karabakh region, which comprises present Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent lowland territories ('lowland Karabakh').\n\nThe Karabakh carpets amount to 33 compositions. Due to the specifics of the local sheep wool the Karabakh carpets are characterized by thick pile, high and fluffy. These carpets are marked for their vivid and joyous colors. They are divided into four groups: without medallions, with medallions, namazlyk and subject carpet. In the mountainous part of Karabakh the carpets were made in Malybeili, Muradkhanly, Dashbulakh, Jebrail, Goradis and many other villages.\n\nShirvan is one of the most ancient historical regions of Azerbaijan. Carpet making of different types is a widespread craft with both settled and nomadic natives. The Shirvan school accounts for carpets manufactured in the following towns and villages of the Shirvan region: Shemaha, Maraza, Akhsu, Kurdamir. The school totals 25 compositions. The Salyan carpets, with similar artistic and technical features, also belong to this school. The Shirvan carpets are characterized by an intricate design, which depicts numerous artifacts of everyday life, birds and people.\n\nAzerbaijan is a country where national traditions are well preserved. One of the oldest traditions of the people in this country is the celebration of Novruz and is a cherished holiday of a New Year and spring. It is celebrated on the day of vernal equinox - March 21–22. Novruz is the symbol of nature renewal and fertility. Novrus, also known as Nooroz or Nawruz in other countries, is an ancient celebration shared among peoples living under pre-Islamic Persian Empires.\n\nCultural festivities during Novruz have striking resemblance to those in other countries of the region, namely Iran. Preparations for Novruz start long before the holiday. Rooted in Zoarastrian beliefs, in preparation for the arrival of the New Year, people do house cleaning, plant trees, make new dresses, paint eggs, make national pastries such as shekerbura, pakhlava and a great variety of local cuisine. As is traditional in other countries that celebrate Novruz, wheat is fried with kishmish (raisins) and nuts (govurga). It is essential for every house to have semeni - sprouts of wheat. As a tribute to fire-worshiping (an ancient Zoarastrian belief) every Tuesday during four weeks before the holiday kids jump over small bonfires and candles are lit, a tradition shared with Iran, where it is called Chahar-shanbeh sori. On the holiday eve the graves of relatives are visited and tended.\n\nNovruz is a family holiday. In the evening before the holiday the whole family gathers around the holiday table laid with various dishes to make the New Year rich. The holiday goes on for several days and ends with festive public dancing and other entertainment of folk bands, contests of national sports. In rural areas crop holidays are marked.\n\nAzerbaijani Literature refers to the literature written in Azerbaijani, which currently is the official state language of the Republic of Azerbaijan and is spoken by about a quarter of the population of Iran. Its closest relatives are Turkish and Turkmen.\nAzeri is a dialect of Oghuz branch of Turkic languages, and as such, is mutually intelligible with other Oghuz dialects spoken in Turkey, Iran, Turkmenistan, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Russia, the Balkans and the Middle East.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Azeri Turkic language came into existence with the invasion and settlement of waves of Turkic tribes from Central Asia over several centuries. The indigenous language of the region above and below the Aras river was a mix of Iranian Tati, Taleshi, and Armenian. With the increasing dominance of Turkic rulers, the language of the region gradually was infused with Turkic, resulting in what is known in modern days as the Azeri language.\n\nTaleshi is still a spoken language in parts of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\nAs a result of the language policy of the Soviet Union, Russian is also commonly spoken as a second language among the urbane.\n\nApart from the Epic of Dede Korkut, which may date to the 9th century CE. and was first transcribed by the 14th century, the earliest known figure in Azeri literature was Pur Hasan Asfaraini, who composed a divan consisting of Persian and Turkic ghazals. In Persian ghazals he used his own name, while his Turkic ghazals were composed under a pen-name of Hasan Oghlu.\n\nNizami Ganjavi who was born in Ganja is considered the greatest romantic epic poet in Persian literature, who brought a colloquial and realistic style to the Persian epic. His heritage is widely appreciated and shared by Azerbaijan, Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan.\n\nIn the 14th century, Azerbaijan was under the control of Qara Qoyunlu and Aq Qoyunlu Turkic tribal confederacies. Among the poets of this period were Kadi Burhan al-Din, Haqiqi (pen-name of Jahan-shah Qara Qoyunlu), and Habibi. The end of the 14th century was also the period of starting literary activity of Imadaddin Nesimi, one of the greatest Turkic Hurufi mystical poets of the late 14th and early 15th centuries and one of the most prominent early Divan masters in Turkic literary history, who also composed poetry in Persian and Arabic.\n\nUnder the Soviet rule, particularly during Joseph Stalin's reign, Azeri writers who did not conform to the party line were persecuted. Bolsheviks sought to destroy the nationalist intellectual elite established during the short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, and in the 1930s, many writers and intellectuals were essentially turned into mouthpieces of Soviet propaganda.\n\nPersian and Arabic literature have greatly influenced Azeri literature, especially in its classical phase. Amongst poets who have written in Persian and have influenced Azeri literature, one can mention Ferdowsi, Sanai, Hafiz, Saadi, Attar, and Rumi. Arabic literature, especially the Quran and Prophetic sayings, has also played a major role in influencing Azeri literature. Amongst poets who have written in Arabic and have influenced Azeri literature, one can mention Mansūr al-Hallāj who has had a wide-ranging influence in the Sufic literature of the Islamic world.\n\nIn 1875 \"Akinchi (Əkinçi / اکينچی )\" (\"The Ploughman\") became the first Azeri newspaper to be published in the Russian Empire. It was started by Hasan bey Zardabi, a journalist and education advocate. Starting in the 1830s several newspapers were published in Iran during the reign of the Azeri speaking Qajar dynasty but it is unknown whether any of these newspapers were written in Azeri.\n\nIn the Republic of Azerbaijan recent years, large numbers of Azerbaijani journalists, bloggers, lawyers, and human rights activists have been rounded up and jailed for their criticism of President Aliyev and government authorities.\n\nMusic of Azerbaijan includes various styles that reflect influences from the music of the Iran, Caucasus and Central Asia. Azerbaijani music is also similar to Iranian music and Turkish.\n\nThe classical music of Azerbaijan is called \"mugam\" (more accurately spelled \"muğam\"), and is usually a suite with poetry and instrumental interludes. The sung poetry sometimes includes tahrir segments, which use a form of throat singing similar to yodelling. The poetry is typically about divine love and is most often linked to Sufi Islam.\nIn contrast to the \"mugam\" traditions of Central Asian countries, Azeri \"mugam\" is more free-form and less rigid; it is often compared to the improvised field of jazz.\nUNESCO proclaimed the Azerbaijani \"mugam\" tradition a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on 7 November 2003.\nMeykhana and Mugham are one of the many musical traditions of Azerbaijan. During Mugam, the singers have to transform their emotions into singing and music. Mugham singer Alim Qasimov is revered as one of the five best singers of all time.\nMeykhana is a kind of traditional Azeri distinctive folk unaccompanied song, usually performed by several people improvising on a particular subject.\nAmong national musical instruments there are fourteen string instruments, eight percussion instruments and six wind instruments.\n\nAnnually a cultural and musical festival that is held in Shaki, known as Mugam Festival.\n\nThe Mugham Festival was founded and is traditionally celebrated in the Azerbaijani city of Shusha. The last Mugham Festival in Shusha took place in 1988. Because of the conflict in the Karabakh region, Shusha has been occupied by Armenian forces since 1992 and all Azeris have fled the city. Today the festival lives on and has been held in Shaki since November 1994. Every year thousands of people participate in this festival.\n\nMeykhana is a distinctive Azerbaijani literary and folk rap tradition, consisting of an unaccompanied song performed by one or more people improvising on a particular subject. The name of this genre comes from the traditional Turkish \"meyhane\" (tavern, pub), which itself originated from the Persian words \"mey\" (wine) and \"hane\" (house). Since medieval times, meyhanes were places where poets would gather exchanging verses in an extemporaneous fashion, sometimes joking and disparaging one another. At the end of the contest, the audience determined which poet had improvised the most elegant and clever verses and declared him the winner. These contests may be compared with modern poetry improvisation contests or even with rap battles.\n\nInstruments used in traditional Azeri music include the stringed instruments \"tar\" (skin faced lute), the \"kamancha\" (skin faced spike fiddle), the \"oud\", originally \"barbat\", and the \"saz\" (long necked lute); the double-reed wind instrument \"balaban\", the frame drum \"ghaval\", the cylindrical double faced drum \"naghara\" (\"davul\"), and the \"goshe nagara\" (\"naqareh\") (pair of small kettle drums). Other instruments include the \"garmon\" (small accordion), \"tutek\" (whistle flute), \"daf\" (frame drum) and \"nagara (drum)\" (barrel drum).\n\nAshiqs are traveling bards who sing and play the saz, a form of lute. Their songs are semi-improvised around a common base.\n\nThe Ashik tradition in Turkic cultures of Anatolia, Azerbaijan and Central Asia has its origin in the Shamanistic beliefs of ancient Turkic peoples.\n\nThe most celebrated traditional Azerbaijani holiday is Novruz Bayram, which is the traditional celebration of the ancient New Year. Novruz is a family holiday. In the evening before the holiday the whole family gathers around the holiday table laid with various dishes to make the New Year rich. The holiday goes on for several days and ends with festive public dancing and other entertainment of folk bands, and contests of national sports. During the Soviet Union, celebration of Novruz was generally unofficial, and at times even prohibited. Since the independence of Azerbaijan, Novruz became an official public holiday. Usually preparation for Novruz begins a month prior to the festival. Each Tuesday of the forthcoming 4 weeks is devoted to one of the four elements - water, fire, earth and wind.\n\nOther public and traditional holidays include Ramadan, Women's Day, Ramazan Bayrami, Gurban Bayrami, Republic Day, Constitution Day, Victory Day, Armed Forces Day, Salvation Day, Flag Day, and more.\n\nCommemoration and remembrance days include Black January, Khojaly Massacre and the March Days.\n\nState symbols of Azerbaijan include the Eight-pointed star, combined with fire element in the Azerbaijan coat of arms. The Azerbaijani flag dates from the late Azerbaijan Democratic Republic period and became widely used since modern times. Azerbaijan National Anthem contains words by Ahmad Javad, and the music was composed by Uzeyir Hajibeyov.\n\nAround 93 percent of Azerbaijan's population is nominally Muslim, while about 5 percent of the population adheres to Russian Orthodox Church. Among the Muslim majority, religious observance is relatively low and Muslim identity tends to be based more on culture and ethnicity rather than religion. The Muslim population is approximately 70 percent Shi'a and 30 percent Sunni; differences traditionally have not been defined sharply.\n\nThere are fairly sizeable expatriate Christian and Muslim communities in the capital city of Baku; authorities generally permit these groups to worship freely.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union all religious organizations fell into depression and split into pieces while the Religious Organization of Transcaucasia, Muslims headed by akhund Allanshukur Pashazade elected the sheykhulislam in 1980 intensified its operation and tried to spread its influence to the entire Caucasus under the name of the Caucasus Muslims Department. The measures to implement these attempts were undertaken at the tenth session of the Caucasus Muslims held in Baku in 1998. The opening of CMD representations in Georgia and Dagestan was one of the significant steps in this field.\n\nOrthodoxy is currently represented in Azerbaijan by the Russian and Georgian Orthodox churches. The Russian Orthodox Churches are grouped in the Eparchy of Baku and the Caspian region.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church in Azerbaijan is part of the worldwide Roman Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. It is one of the least Catholic countries in the world in terms of the number of adherents with only 400 faithful out of a total population of over seven million. About half of the congregation consists of foreigners that work as diplomats or work for oil companies.\n\nThere are three separate communities of Jews (Mountain Jews, Ashkenazi Jews, and Georgian Jews) in Azerbaijan, who total almost 16,000 combined. Of them, 11,000 are Mountain Jews, with concentrations of 6,000 in Baku and 4,000 in Guba, 4,300 are Ashkenazi Jews, most of whom live in Baku and Sumgayit, and 700 are Georgian Jews.\n\nThe history of Zoroastrianism in Azerbaijan goes back to the first millennium BC. Together with the other territories of the Persian Empire, Azerbaijan remained a predominantly Zoroastrian state until the Arab invasion in the 7th century AD. The name Azerbaijan means the \"Land of The Eternal Fire\" in Middle Persian, a name that is said to have a direct link with Zoroastrianism.\n\nToday the religion, culture, and traditions of Zoroastrianism remains highly respected in Azerbaijan, and Novruz continues to be the main holiday in the country. Zoroastrianism has left a deep mark in the history of Azerbaijan. Traces of the religion are still visible in Atashgah, Ramana, Khinalyg, and Yanar Dag.\n\nAfter gaining independence, Azerbaijan has taken important measures throughout the country to protect the cultural values, to enhance the cultural life and began to cooperate with international organizations in this area. A number of important legislative acts have been adopted by the Azerbaijani Parliament so far in the sphere of culture. These decisions are on: “Restoration of the Azerbaijani alphabet based on Latin script” (December 25, 1991); “Mass media” (21 July 1992); “The Copyright Agency of the Republic of Azerbaijan” (10 September 1993); “Advertising” (3 October 1997); “Culture” (6 February 1998); “Protection of historical and cultural monuments\" (10 April 1998); “Grants” (17 April 1998); “Freedom of information” (19 June 1998); “Cinematography” (3 July 1998); \"Sculpture activities\" (3 July 1998); “Tourism” (4 July 1999); “Urban planning” (11 June 1999); “National Archive Fund” (22 June 1999); “Mass media” (8 February 2000); “Museums” (24 March 2000); “Publishing” and etc.\n\nLegal basis of protection of cultural issues, particularly historical and cultural monuments is not only local legislative acts, but also international documents. These documents include the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property the Event of Armed Conflict, the 1970 Paris Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, the 1995 Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects.\n\nMinistry of Culture and Tourism was established in 2006 according to the decree of the Azerbaijani President. Besides preserving the national cultural values of the nation within the country, Azerbaijan cooperates with international organizations like UN, UNESCO, ISESCO, and European Council to get support for forming the international cultural policy and is an active participant of various international projects.\n\nAzerbaijan joined European Heritage Days project initiated by Council of Europe and European Union in 2000. On 26–28 September 2003 European Heritage Days – 2003 Campaign was held in Azerbaijan. During this Campaign it was planned to take part in the opening of monuments that have been restored according to international projects, as well as to review the monuments that are still being restored, to present the exhibition and catalog of the next (8th) Photo experience -2003 International Photo Initiative, to conduct European Common Heritage Program and European Cultural Heritage Campaign at schools and universities.\n\nThe topic of the \"European Heritage Days\" held in Azerbaijan in 2005 was \"Civilizations and peacekeeping processes\". The campaign consisted of two events:\n\n- Conducting the \"East-West\" Baku International Festival, which is usually held in an independent form, but included in the Campaign's ideology space in 2005\n\n- Conducting a photo contest of children and youth within the \"Photo-experience-2005\" event and demonstration of the results at the Republican Youth Forum, besides distribution of \"Photo-experience-2005\" catalog from Barcelona.\n\nAzerbaijan became the member of UNESCO in 1992, and UNESCO National Commission in Azerbaijan within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was established according to the decree of the former President Haydar Aliyev in 1994. The heritage of Azerbaijan became the part of world heritage in the result of UNESCO-Azerbaijan relations. Azerbaijan joined the conventions of UNESCO “The preservation of cultural values and heritage”, “The recognition of specialties in higher education, diplomas and degrees”, “The preservation of intangible cultural heritage” and so on.\n\nTwo Azerbaijani cultural elements were included in the World Heritage List:\n\n- “Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah’s Palace and Maiden Tower” in 2000;\n\n- “Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape” in 2007.\n\nMugham was included in the list of “Masterpiece of humankind and intangible heritage” in 2003. Besides, intangible cultural elements like “The Art of Azerbaijani Ashiq”, “Novruz”, “Azerbaijani carpet weaving”, “Craftsmanship and performance art of the Tar”, “Chovqan”, “Kelaghayi”, “Copper craftsmanship of Lahij” and \"Flatbread making and sharing culture” have been inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage.\n\nA number of concerts, jubilees, scientific seminars and symposiums, conferences and congresses, meetings and festivities were organized in the framework of UNESCO as “500 anniversary of the birth of Muhammad Fuzuli”(1996), “1300th anniversary of Kitabi-Dada Gorgud” (2000), “800th anniversary of the birth of Nasraddin Tusi” (2001), “200th anniversary of the birth of Mirza Kazimbey” (2002), “100th anniversary of the birth of Mir Jalal Pashayev” (2008), “900th anniversary of achievements of Mahsati Ganjavi” (2013), “100th anniversary of the musical comedy Arshin Mal Alan of Uzeyir Hajibeyli” (2013) and etc.\n\nIn 2013 UNESCO and Azerbaijan signed a Framework Agreement on Cooperation in the fields of education, science, culture and communication. To promote and develop the cooperation with UNESCO in the mentioned fields on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is the main objective of this Agreement.\n\nBaku was declared capital of Islamic culture for the year 2009 because of its hosting the 6th Islamic Conference of Culture Ministers. Baku hosted the World forum on Intercultural Dialogue (2011, 2013, 2015, 2017) initiated by Azerbaijan and supported by UNESCO, UN Alliance of Civilizations, Council of Europe, North - South Center of the Council of Europe, ISESCO and the Euronews.\n\n"}

{"id": "2071247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071247", "title": "Chain whip", "text": "Chain whip\n\nThe chain whip is a weapon used in some Chinese martial arts, particularly traditional Chinese disciplines, in addition to modern and traditional wushu. It consists of several metal rods, which are joined end-to-end by rings to form a flexible chain. Generally, the whip has a handle at one end and a metal dart, used for slashing or piercing an opponent, at the other. A cloth flag is often attached at or near the dart end of the whip and a second flag may cover the whip's handle. The flag or flags adds visual appeal and produces a rushing sound as the whip swings through the air. The rushing noise also helps the user with identifying the location of the other end, since the weapon moves too fast to be normally noticed by human eyes.\n\nThere is no standard on the length of the chain whip. The typical length is also different between north and south China. The chain is shorter in the south which make it more suitable for close quarter fighting. In the north the length could be from the ground to the chin or the ground to the tip of the nose. Weight is heavier for practice and lighter for performance.\n\nThe cloth flag could be either rectangular or triangular. Triangular flags look better and move faster but rectangular flags sound better and allow better control.\n\nThe number of segments vary. Traditional whips have either seven or nine segments. Modern whips typically have between seven and thirteen sections.\n\nMost whips today are made from stainless steel. With good whips, there is better color and shine to the metal, segments are stylized, holes are precisely centered, the chain rotates smoothly in the swivel built into the handle, there are no sharp corners or edges, and welds are strong. In addition, the handle should be shaped to allow good grip. Leather on the handles is best for endurance, as it absorbs sweat and prevents slippage. The typical construction method for chain whips is to use a steel bolt to thread through small pieces of leather and then use a lathe to round and shape the handle. The tip should be larger than the segments and weight proportional to the handle. Shape and weight distribution should allow the chain to be easily tossed and retrieved into one hand.\n\nAccording to the book \"Soft Weapons: Nine-Section Whip and Rope Dart\", \"The nine-section whip, regarded as a 'powerful hidden weapon,' was first used on the battlefield during the Jìn Dynasty (265-420).\"\n\nAccording to the book \"The Chain Whip\", this may refer to the hard whip (more akin to a truncheon than a multi-section whip) due to the ambiguity in the Chinese. \"Both the hard whip and the soft whip can both be referred to simply as \"whip\" (鞭) in Chinese.\". Different books make wildly differing claims about the history of the Chain Whip.\n\nThe chain whip is heavy but flexible, allowing it to be literally used as a whip to hit, hook and bind an opponent, restrict his/her movement, and to deflect blows from other weapons. The dart is used for slashing or piercing an opponent. In some cases, the dart might be coated with a poison. Because the whip is flexible, it can be used to strike around obstacles, including an opponent's block. The whip chain can be folded and hidden from view, making it an easy weapon to carry and conceal.\n\nChain whip forms are often extremely elaborate. In some, the chain whip is thrown in the air and caught, flicked around the neck, or flung around underneath a recumbent performer. One classic technique, used to accelerate a spinning chain whip, involves rapidly wrapping and unwrapping the length of the chain around various parts of the body, including the legs, neck and elbows. Various twisting or flicking motions cause the chain whip to gain momentum as it unwraps. In practice, wrapping then unwrapping is used to change the direction of the spin in response to the opponent's movement.\n\nChain whip techniques may be combined with jumping kicks and other acrobatics. Double chain whip forms have been developed, as have forms in which a chain whip is coupled with a broadsword.\n\nFor performance the chain whip can be used to perform meteor moves such as one hand or two hand meteor rotors and weaves. At the end of the performance the chain whip segments can be pulled and collected into the hand holding the handle.\n\nAs with all weapons that are either chained or tied together, the whip chain is hard to control without practice. In fact, it is harder to control than a traditional rawhide or bull whip because the linked sections provide looser joints while a bull whip is a continuous piece. The chain whip is sometimes considered one of the hardest weapons in martial arts to learn because lapse in the control of body movements in coordination with the position and momentum of the weapon will likely result in the weapon striking the wielder.\n\n\n\n"}

It was developed in November 1974, with the first aircraft delivered in September 1977. It is a pressurized, 8–9 passenger turbine development of the Cessna 404 Titan.\n\nThe original design from 1972 for this aircraft was known as the Model 435 and was to be powered by Continental GTSIO-520X engines with three bladed propellers. By 1975 the designed evolved into the turboprop powered Model 441. It was certified by the FAA on August 19, 1977.\nCessna renamed the model 441 the Conquest II in 1983.\n1984 models starting with constructor number 195 used lighter weight four-bladed McCauley propellers. \nA 441 with Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-112 turboprops was flown in 1986 but did not enter production.\nA smaller aircraft was marketed as the Cessna 425 Conquest I, itself a turbine development of the Cessna 421.\n\nIn Summer 2007, Cessna limited the Conquest II to 22,500 hours of air time for US for air carriers, an advise only for private operators.\nCessna built 362 units from 1977 through 1986.\n\nIt cruises at TAS while burning of fuel per hour at FL290, while maximum range is at TAS and /h at FL350.\n\nWith six to nine seats, its BOW allows a payload at full fuel, but MTOW can be increased by with aftermarket modifications.\n\nMost have been upgraded from twin Garrett TPE331-8s engines to -10s for better climb performance, a ceiling raised to FL350 from FL330, and TBO raised from 3,000 to 5,000h for $225,000 per engine.\n\nConverting from the standard three blade propellers to smaller diameter Hartzell four blade propellers results in a climb rate improved by 200 fpm (1.01 m/s) and a increase in cruise speed as well as reducing cabin noise and improving ground clearance.\nThe aircraft has a retractable tricycle landing gear and has a ground roll of 1,785 ft (544 m) on takeoff. The high aspect ratio wings use bonded construction techniques.\nThe ICAO designator for the Cessna Conquest as used in flight plans is C441.\n\nBy May 2019, 290 aircraft remained in service, at a $.75-.9M value down from $1-1.9M in 2011.\n\nThe King Air B200 has a roomier cabin but less range, a slower cruise and higher fuel burn.\nThe Mitsubishi MU-2B-60 has a similar fuel burn and speed but flies lower.\nThe Piper Cheyenne III is fast but has poorer fuel efficiency and less range.\nThe Piper Cheyenne 400 is faster but burns fuel like a light jet.\n\nThe Conquest is operated by corporate owners, air charter operators and previously by the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Australia. Examples of the type have been exported to many countries including Austria, Australia, Canada, Ecuador, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Mexico, Norway, Peru, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom. \n\n"}

His best known songs as a performer are \"Utopia\", \"Lullaby of Love\", and \"Princess\", all of which hit the U.S. \"Billboard\" top 40 charts in 1961. Contributing to this early acclaim was Gari's unique rich voice blending with carefully selected melodic instrumentation and backup singers, all of which created a deep sense of magic, ethereal perfection, sincerity and emotion. With song writing partner Roger McGuinn of the Byrds, they wrote the song \"Beach Ball\" while working with singer Bobby Darin. Gari and McGuinn appeared on Capitol Records billed as the City Surfers. Frank performed his records on shows such as \"The Merv Griffin Show\", \"The Steve Allen Show\", and \"American Bandstand\". He also performed at the world-famous \"Empire Room\" of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City with the Woody Herman Band. That year, he moved to Cleveland, becoming a jingle writer for television commercials. Some of his early jingles were for Ohio Bell, Genie garage doors, and early commercials for Wendy's. Frank has won numerous Emmy and Clio awards, and was later honored with the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award from the broadcast industry.\n\nGari is best known today as a music composer and producer for television, and is also one of the most sought after composers of music for television newscasts in America. His first television theme and image campaign was the popular \"Catch 5\", originally written for WEWS-TV in Cleveland in 1970.\n\nGari created and produced the \"Hello\" image campaign, which has been described as \"one of the most popular local television campaigns ever made\".\n\nBetraying the exclusivity implicit in the opening lyric of \"There's a feeling in the air/that you can't get anywhere but (location)...\", the campaign was recorded with localized lyrics and imagery in approximately 120 media markets across the United States, Canada, Latin America, and Australia. It debuted in 1977 as \"Hello Milwaukee\" for WISN-TV.\n\nIn 2014, Gari was interviewed about the campaign on \"This American Life\", Episode 520 (\"No Place Like Home\") after host Ira Glass interviewed a fan of \"Hello Calgary.\" Glass surprised the fan with other markets' variants - dashing his belief that the song had been exclusive to his hometown.\n\nWhile the lead female vocalist for many renditions was Florence Warner, markets also used local performers including KUTV-TV in Utah, which aired a version recorded by The Osmonds.\n\nHe continued composing music for the American Broadcasting Company during the early and mid-1980s, and created such campaigns as \"We're With You on ABC\", \"Now is the Time, ABC is the Place\", and \"Come On Along with ABC\" with Artie Schroeck, as well as \"That Special Feeling on ABC\", and \"You'll Love it on ABC\". He also composed music for \"Eyewitness News\" on ABC such as WABC-TV, ABC's \"Good Morning America\" (in 1989), \"CBS This Morning\", \"The Phil Donahue Show\", and \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\".\n\nGari also had international clientele: in 1993, he composed the \"Sky Symphony\" theme for BSkyB in Europe, and the 1995 \"It's On Sky\" (also known as \"No Turning Back\") image piece. The Sky signature from the 1990s was spread to all the Sky channels, including Sky One, Sky Movies, and the defunct Sky Soap and Sky Movies Gold. Sky News used \"The Great News Package\" as their main theme from 1989 (when they launched their four-channel Astra lineup) until September 1993, and continued to use it (for main news bulletins on Sky News only) alongside the 'Sky Symphony' until 1995. He also composed the early 1990s theme for RTL in Germany called \"News Line\", which was later adopted by Maryland Public Television in the United States, and in the Philippines it was adapted for the primetime newscast \"TV Patrol\" on ABS-CBN. Other international television networks that used Gari's music include MBC 1, Pro TV, and Markíza.\n\nOn January 12, 2015, Warner Music Group's Warner/Chappell Production Music unit acquired Gari Communications.\n\n"}
{"id": "2071275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071275", "title": "United States–Venezuela relations", "text": "United States–Venezuela relations\n\nUnited States–Venezuela relations refers to the bilateral relationship between the United States and Venezuela. Relations have traditionally been characterized by an important trade and investment relationship as well as cooperation in combating the production and transit of illegal drugs. As of 23 January 2019, the United States and Venezuela have no formal diplomatic ties, but continue to have relations under Juan Guaidó, who serves as disputed interim president recognized by around 54 countries, including the United States.\n\nRelations were strong under traditional governments in Venezuela, such as those of Carlos Andrés Pérez and Rafael Caldera. However, tensions increased after the socialist President Hugo Chávez assumed elected office in 1999. Tensions between the countries increased further after Venezuela accused the administration of George W. Bush of supporting the Venezuelan failed coup attempt in 2002 against Chavez, an accusation that was partly retracted later.\n\nRelations between the United States and Venezuela have been further strained when the country expelled the U.S. ambassador in September 2008 in solidarity with Bolivia after a U.S. ambassador was accused of cooperating with violent anti-government groups in the country. Though relations thawed somewhat under President Barack Obama in June 2009, only to steadily deteriorate once again shortly afterwards. In February 2014, the Venezuelan government ordered three American diplomats out of the country on charges of promoting violence.\n\nOn 23 January, during the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis Nicolás Maduro announced that Venezuela was breaking ties with the United States following President Trump's announcement that the US recognized Juan Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader, as the interim President. On 26 January 2019, Maduro backtracked the request which defused the situation from a few days earlier with the request of the embassy staff to leave. Maduro's government was in a 30-day talk with the Trump Administration to open a U.S. Interest Office on 26 January.\n\nDuring the Spanish American wars of independence, the United States was officially neutral but permitted Spanish American agents to obtain weapons and supplies. With the reception of Manuel Torres in 1821, the Gran Colombia (present-day Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, northern Peru, Venezuela, western Guyana and northwest Brazil) became the first former Spanish colony recognized by the United States, and the United States was the second government (after the Kingdom of Brazil) to recognize an independent Spanish American state. At that time, mutual relations have existed since the U.S. established a diplomatic mission in Santa Fe de Bogota in 1823. The next year the Anderson–Gual Treaty became the first bilateral treaty the U.S. concluded with another American country. U.S. relations with the governments in Bogotá, Quito and Caracas were not interrupted when Ecuador and Venezuela left the federation in 1830.\n\nThe Venezuela Crisis of 1902–03 saw a naval blockade of several months imposed against Venezuela by Britain, Germany and Italy because of President Cipriano Castro's refusal to pay foreign debts and damages suffered by European citizens in a recent Venezuelan civil war. Castro assumed that the United States' Monroe Doctrine would see that the U.S. prevent European military intervention, but at the time the U.S. saw the Doctrine as concerning European seizure of territory, rather than intervention per se. Though U.S. Secretary of State, Elihu Root, characterized Castro as a \"\"crazy brute\"\" or a \"\"monkey\"\", President Theodore Roosevelt was concerned with the prospects of penetration into the region by Germany. With Castro failing to back down under U.S. pressure and increasingly negative British and American press reactions to the affair, the blockading nations agreed to a compromise, but maintained the blockade during negotiations over the details. This incident was a major driver of the Roosevelt Corollary and the subsequent U.S. Big Stick policy and Dollar Diplomacy in Latin America.\n\nWhen American diplomat, Herbert Wolcott Bowen, returned to Venezuela in January 1904, he noticed Venezuela seemed more peaceful and secure. Castro would reassure Bowen that the United States and Venezuela were experiencing a strong relationship. However, after the Castro regime delayed fulfilling the agreements which ended the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03, Bowen lost confidence. This would eventually lead to the Castro regime's economic policy angering the United States, France, and the Netherlands. This would play a crucial role in the Dutch–Venezuelan crisis of 1908.\n\nDictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez overthrew the elected president, Rómulo Gallegos, and seized power in the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état. During this prosperity, foreign investment, particularly from American oil companies, grew along with the support from the Jiménez Regime. The anti-communist regime allowed and supported the exploitation of the country's natural resources by the American oil industry, as a portion of the profits made its way from companies like Mobil and Exxon to the personal coffers of Pérez Jiménez.\n\nPérez Jiménez received the Legion of Merit from the U.S. government in 1954.\n\nThe , headed by , disappeared and tortured thousands of Venezuelans, both in its headquarters in Caracas and in a confinement camp on in the jungles of the Orinoco. After the 1958 Venezuelan coup d'état, when Pérez Jiménez abandoned the government and the country on 23 January 1958, more than 400 prisoners were found in the basement of the headquarters of the \"Seguridad Nacional\".\n\nRelations have traditionally been characterized by an important trade and investment relationship and cooperation in combating the production and transit of illegal drugs and were strong under the Puntofijo Pact governments in Venezuela, such as those of Carlos Andrés Pérez and Rafael Caldera.\n\nAfter Hugo Chávez was first elected President of Venezuela by a landslide in 1998, the South American country began to reassert sovereignty over its oil reserves. This action challenged the comfortable position held by U.S. economic interests for the better part of a century. The Chávez administration overturned the privatization of the state-owned oil company PDVSA, raising royalties for foreign firms and eventually doubling the country's GDP. Those oil revenues were used to fund social programs aimed at fostering human development in areas such as health, education, employment, housing, technology, culture, pensions, and access to safe drinking water.\n\nChávez's public friendship and significant trade relationship with Cuba and Fidel Castro undermined the U.S. policy of isolating Cuba; moreover, on Chavez's initiative, long-running ties between the U.S. and Venezuelan militaries were severed. During Venezuela's presidency of OPEC in 2000, Chávez made a ten-day tour of OPEC countries. In the process, he became the first head of state to meet Saddam Hussein since the Gulf War. The visit was controversial in the U.S., although, Chávez did respect the ban on international flights to and from Iraq as he drove from his previous stop in Iran.\n\nDuring the evacuation of survivors of the Vargas tragedy, when torrential rains and the flash floods and debris flows in the Vargas State in 2000 killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed thousands of homes, a disaster relief team from the United States headed up by New Mexico State Senator Joseph Carraro arrived with a medical team and supplies to assess the damage and help those who were displaced. Contact was made with Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico to determine any radioactive activity included in debris field. Water purification and sleeping units were provided.\n\nThe disaster clean-up soon became politicized. Chávez initially accepted assistance from anyone who offered, with the United States sending helicopters and dozens of soldiers that arrived two days after the disaster. When defense minister Raúl Salazar complied with the offer of the United States' further aid that included 450 Marines and naval engineers aboard the USS \"Tortuga\" which was setting sail to Venezuela, Chávez told Salazar to decline the offer since \"[i]t was a matter of sovereignty\". Salazar became angry and assumed that Chávez's opinion was influenced by talks with Fidel Castro, though he complied with Chávez's order. Though additional aid was necessary, Chávez thought a more revolutionary image was more important and the USS \"Tortuga\" returned to its port.\n\nIn April 2002, 19 people died in the Llaguno Overpass events in Venezuela, which resulted in Chavez’ removal from power while an interim government led. After returning to power, Chávez claimed that a plane with U.S. registration numbers had visited and been berthed at Venezuela's Orchila Island airbase, where Chávez had been held captive. On 14 May 2002, Chávez alleged that he had definitive proof of U.S. military involvement in April's coup. He claimed that during the coup, Venezuelan radar images had indicated the presence of U.S. military naval vessels and aircraft in Venezuelan waters and airspace. \"The Guardian\" published a claim by Wayne Madsen alleging U.S. Navy involvement. U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd, D-CT, requested an investigation of concerns that Washington appeared to condone the removal of Mr Chavez, which found that \"U.S. officials acted appropriately and did nothing to encourage an April coup against Venezuela's president\" nor did they provide any naval logistical support. CIA documents indicate that the Bush administration knew about a plot weeks before the April 2002 military coup. They cite a document dated 6 April 2002, which says: \"dissident military factions...are stepping up efforts to organize a coup against President Chavez, possibly as early as this month.\" According to William Brownfield, ambassador to Venezuela, the U.S. embassy in Venezuela warned Chávez about a coup plot in April 2002. Further, the United States Department of State and the investigation by the Office of the Inspector General found no evidence that \"U.S. assistance programs in Venezuela, including those funded by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), were inconsistent with U.S. law or policy\" or \". . . directly contributed, or was intended to contribute, to [the coup d'état].\"\n\nChávez also claimed, during the coup's immediate aftermath, that the U.S. was still seeking his overthrow. On October 6, 2002, he stated that he had foiled a new coup plot, and on 20 October 2002, he stated that he had barely escaped an assassination attempt while returning from a trip to Europe. However, his administration failed to investigate or present conclusive evidence to that effect. During that period, the US Ambassador to Venezuela warned the Chávez administration of two potential assassination plots.\n\nVenezuela expelled US naval commander, John Correa, in January 2006. The Venezuelan government claimed Correa, an attaché at the US embassy, had been collecting information from low-ranking Venezuelan military officers. Chavez claimed he had infiltrated the US embassy and found evidence of Correa's spying. The US declared these claims \"baseless\" and responded by expelling Jeny Figueredo, the chief aid to the Venezuelan ambassador, to the US. Chavez promoted Figueredo to Deputy Foreign Minister to Europe.\n\nHugo Chávez repeatedly alleged that the US had a plan, entitled Plan Balboa, to invade Venezuela. In an interview with Ted Koppel, Chavez stated \"I have evidence that there are plans to invade Venezuela. Furthermore, we have documentation: how many bombers to overfly Venezuela on the day of the invasion, how many trans-Atlantic carriers, how many aircraft carriers...\" Neither President Chavez nor officials of his administration ever presented such evidence. The US denies the allegations, claiming that Plan Balboa is a military simulation carried out by Spain.\n\nOn 20 February 2005, Chávez reported that the U.S. had plans to have him assassinated; he stated that any such attempt would result in an immediate cessation of U.S.-bound Venezuelan petroleum shipments.\n\nChávez's socialist ideology and the tensions between the Venezuelan and the United States governments had little impact on economic relations between the two countries. On 15 September 2005, President Bush designated Venezuela as a country that has \"failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements.\" However, at the same time, the President waived the economic sanctions that would normally accompany such a designation, because they would have curtailed his government's assistance for democracy programs in Venezuela. In 2006, the United States remained Venezuela's most important trading partner for both oil exports and general imports – bilateral trade expanded 36% during that year As of 2007, the U.S. imported more than $40 billion in oil from Venezuela and the trade between the countries topped $50 billion despite the tumultuous relationship between the two.\n\nWith rising oil prices and Venezuela's oil exports accounting for the bulk of trade, bilateral trade between the US and Venezuela surged, with US companies and the Venezuelan government benefiting. Nonetheless, since May 2006, the Department of State, pursuant to Section 40A of the Arms Export Control Act, has prohibited the sale of defense articles and services to Venezuela because of lack of cooperation on anti-terrorism efforts.\n\nSince the start of the George W. Bush administration in 2001, relations between Venezuela and the United States deteriorated markedly, as Chávez became highly critical of the U.S. economic and foreign policy. Moreover, he criticized U.S. policy with regards to Iraq, Haiti, Kosovo the Free Trade Area of the Americas, and other areas. Chávez also denounced the U.S.-backed ouster of Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February 2004. In a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Chávez said that Bush promoted \"a false democracy of the elite\" and a \"democracy of bombs\".\n\nChávez's public friendship and significant trade relationship with Cuba and Fidel Castro undermined the U.S. policy of isolating Cuba; moreover, on Chavez's initiative, long-running ties between the U.S. and Venezuelan militaries were also severed. Chávez's stance as an OPEC price hawk has also raised the price of petroleum for American consumers, as Venezuela pushed OPEC producers towards lower production ceilings, with the resultant price settling around $25 a barrel prior to 2004. During Venezuela's holding of the OPEC presidency in 2000, Chávez made a ten-day tour of OPEC countries. In the process, he became the first head of state to meet Saddam Hussein since the Gulf War. The visit was controversial both in Venezuela and in the US, although Chávez did respect the ban on international flights to and from Iraq (he drove from Iran, his previous stop).\n\nThe Bush administration consistently opposed Chávez's policies. Although it did not immediately recognize the Carmona government upon its installation during the 2002 attempted coup, it had funded groups behind the coup, speedily acknowledged the new government and seemed to hope it would last. The U.S. government called Chávez a \"negative force\" in the region, and sought support from among Venezuela's neighbors to isolate Chávez diplomatically and economically. One notable instance occurred at the 2005 meeting of the Organization of American States. A U.S. resolution to add a mechanism to monitor the nature of American democracies was widely seen as an attempt at diplomatically isolating both Chávez and the Venezuelan government. The failure of the resolution was seen by analysts as politically significant, evidencing widespread support in Latin America for Chávez, his policies, and his views.\n\nThe U.S. also opposed and lobbied against numerous Venezuelan arms purchases made under Chávez. This includes a purchase of some 100,000 rifles from Russia, which Donald Rumsfeld implied would be passed on to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and the purchase of aircraft from Brazil. The U.S. has also warned Israel to not carry through on a deal to upgrade Venezuela's aging fleet of F-16s. In August 2005, Chávez rescinded the rights of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents to operate in Venezuelan territory, territorial airspace, and territorial waters. While U.S. State Department officials stated that the DEA agents' presence was intended to stem cocaine traffic from Colombia, Chávez argued that there was reason to believe the DEA agents were gathering intelligence for a clandestine assassination targeting him, with the ultimate aim of ending the Bolivarian Revolution.\n\nWhen a Marxist insurgency picked up speed in Colombia in the early 2000s, Chavez chose not to support the U.S. in its backing of the Colombian government. Instead, Chavez declared Venezuela to be neutral in the dispute, yet another action that irritated American officials and tensed up relations between the two nations. The border between Venezuela and Colombia was one of the most dangerous borders in Latin America at the time, because of Colombia's war spilling over to Venezuela.\n\nChávez dared the U.S. on 14 March 2008 to put Venezuela on a list of countries accused of supporting terrorism, calling it one more attempt by Washington, D.C. to undermine him for political reasons.\n\nIn May 2011, Venezuela was one of the few countries to condemn the killing of Osama Bin Laden.\n\nChávez's anti-U.S. rhetoric sometimes touched the personal: in response to the ouster of Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February 2004, Chávez called U.S. President George W. Bush a \"pendejo\" (\"jerk\" or \"dumbass\"); in a later speech, he made similar remarks regarding Condoleezza Rice. President Barack Obama called Chávez \"a force that has interrupted progress in the region\". In a 2006 speech at the UN he referred to Bush as \"the Devil\" while speaking at the same podium the US president had used the previous day claiming that \"it still smells of sulphur\". He later commented that Barack Obama \"shared the same stench\".\n\nDuring his weekly address \"Aló Presidente\" of 18 March 2006, Chávez responded to a White House report which characterized him as a \"demagogue who uses Venezuela's oil wealth to destabilize democracy in the region\". During the address Chávez rhetorically called George W. Bush \"a donkey.\" He repeated it several times adding \"\"eres un cobarde ... eres un asesino, un genocida ... eres un borracho\"\" (you are a coward ... you are an assassin, a mass-murderer ... you are a drunk). Chávez said Bush was \"a sick man\" and \"an alcoholic\".\n\nAfter prominent US evangelical, Pat Robertson's in August 2005, Robertson was condemned worldwide, particularly by the Chávez administration, who reported that it would more closely scrutinize and curtail foreign evangelical missionary activity in Venezuela. Chávez himself denounced Robertson's call as a harbinger of a coming U.S. intervention to remove him from office. Chávez reported that Robertson, member of the secretive and elite Council for National Policy (CNP) — of which George Bush, Grover Norquist, and other prominent neoconservative Bush administration insiders were also known members or associates — was guilty of \"international terrorism\". Robertson subsequently for his remarks, which were criticised by Ted Haggard of the U.S.-based National Association of Evangelicals. Haggard was concerned about the effects Roberson's remarks would have on US corporate and evangelical missionaries' interests in Venezuela.\n\nChávez's warm friendship with former Cuban President Fidel Castro, in addition to Venezuela's significant and expanding economic, social, and aid relationships with Cuba, undermined the U.S. policy objective seeking to isolate the island. In 2000 Venezuela stepped in to bolster the Cuban crisis arising from the fall of the Soviet Union. Venezuela agreed to provide Cuba with a third of its oil needs, at a 40% discount supplemented by a subsidized loan, the value of which was estimated at about $1.5-billion per year. In return, Cuba was to deliver doctors to work in Venezuela. The Venezuela assistance to the Cuban economy was estimated at between $10 billion to $13 billion annually between 2010 and 2013. \n\nChávez consolidated diplomatic relations with Iran, including defending its right to civilian nuclear power. Venezuela severed diplomatic relations with Israel in January 2009.\n\nAt the 2005 meeting of the Organization of American States, a United States resolution to add a mechanism to monitor the nature of democracies was widely seen as a move to isolate Venezuela. The failure of the resolution was seen as politically significant, expressing Latin American support for Chávez.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina battered the United States' Gulf coast in late 2005, the Chávez administration offered aid to the region. Chávez offered tons of food, water, and a million barrels of extra petroleum to the U.S. He has also proposed to sell, at a significant discount, as many as of fuel oil to poor communities that were hit by the hurricane and offered mobile hospital units, medical specialists, and electrical generators. According to activist Jesse Jackson, the Bush administration declined the Venezuelan offer. However, United States Ambassador to Venezuela, William Brownfield welcomed the offer of fuel assistance to the region, calling it \"a generous offer\" and saying \"when we are talking about one-to-five million dollars, that is real money. I want to recognize that and say, 'thank you.'\"\n\nIn November 2005, following negotiations by leading US politicians for the US' largest fuel distributors to offer discounts to the less well-off, officials in Massachusetts signed an agreement with Venezuela. The agreement aims to provide heating oil at a 40% discount to low-income families through Citgo, a subsidiary of PDVSA and the only company to respond to the politicians' request. Chávez stated that such gestures comprise \"a strong oil card to play on the geopolitical stage\" and that \"it is a card that we are going to play with toughness against the toughest country in the world, the United States.\"\n\nIn September 2008, following retaliatory measures in support of Bolivia, Chavez expelled the U.S. ambassador Patrick Duddy. Chavez labeled Duddy persona non grata after accusing him of aiding a conspiracy against his government — a charge Duddy consequently denied.\n\nDespite allegedly waning of Hugo Chavez's aggressive foreign policy due to the sharp drop in oil in the last quarter of 2008, hostility with America continued. \"American Corners,\" (AC) a partnership between the Public Affairs sections of U.S. Embassies worldwide and their host institutions, was said to be an interference in Venezuela. In their book, \"Imperial Spiderweb: Encyclopedia of Interference and Subversion\", Eva Golinger and Frenchman, Riman Mingus, warned that it was one of Washington's secret forms of propaganda, Golinger denouncing AC to the Venezuelan National Assembly as virtual consulates, which are not formally sponsored by the US government, but by an organization, association, school, library or local institution. Additionally, they have not only functioned as a launch pad for a psychological war, but also sought to subvert and violate diplomatic rules. The AC's were alleged to be closely supervised by the State Department. Golinger has been described by many as pro-Chavez.\n\nIn January 2009, Chavez announced an investigation into the US Chargé d'Affairs, John Caulfield, who is the leading US diplomat after Duddy's expulsion. He contended that Caulfield had possibly met with opposition Venezuelans in exile in Puerto Rico; an official spokeswoman from the United States said Caulfield was there for a wedding. Chavez used the occasion to accuse \"the empire\" of using Puerto Rico as a base for actions against him and Latin America. He referred to Puerto Rico as a \"gringo colony\" and that one day the island would be liberated.\n\nDuring the 2008 U.S. election, Chávez declared that he had no preference between Barack Obama and John McCain stating \"the two candidates for the US presidency attack us equally, they attack us defending the interests of the empire\". After Obama had won the election, Venezuela's foreign minister labeled the outcome an historic moment in international relations and added that the American people had chosen a \"new brand\" of diplomacy. When Chavez was asked if the previously expelled ambassadors for each country would return, he replied \"everything has its time.\" However, at a rally the evening before the 4 November elections where Chávez was supporting his own candidates Chávez echoed a sentiment by Lula of Brazil and Morales of Bolivia, referencing the change happening in Latin America seemed to be taking place in the US. He expressed hope that he would meet with Obama as soon as possible. However, on 22 March 2009, Chávez called Obama \"ignorant\" and claimed Obama \"has the same stench as Bush\", after the US accused Venezuela of supporting the insurgent Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Chávez was offended after Obama said that he had \"been a force that has interrupted progress in the region\", resulting in his decision to put Venezuela's new ambassador to the United States on hold.\n\nDuring the Summit of the Americas on 17 April 2009, Chávez met with Obama for the first, and only, time where he expressed his wish to become Obama's friend.\n\nOn 10 September 2009, Chávez gave a speech at the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia in Moscow declaring that \"in all history, there was never a government more terrorist than the US. The Empire of the Yankees. They are the main terrorists of the world\", he added, referring to the U.S. \"The Yankee empire will fall. It's already falling, and will disappear from the face of the Earth, and it's going to happen this century.\" \nOn December 20, 2011, Chávez called Obama \"A clown, an embarrassment, and a shame to Black People\" after Obama criticized Venezuela's ties with Iran and Cuba.\n\nVenezuela and the United States have not had ambassadors in each other's capitals since 2010. Shortly before the 2012 US presidential elections, Chávez announced that if he could vote in the election, he would vote for Obama. In 2013, before Hugo Chavez died, Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro expelled two U.S. military attaches from the country, saying they were plotting against Venezuela by attempting to recruit Venezuelan military personnel to destabilize Venezuela and suggested they caused Chavez's cancer. The Obama Administration rejected the allegations and responded by expelling two Venezuelan diplomats.\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014, a U.S. Act imposing sanctions on Venezuelan individuals held responsible by the United States for human rights violations during the 2014 Venezuelan protests, in December of that year. It \"requires the President to impose sanctions\" on those \"responsible for significant acts of violence or serious human rights abuses associated with February 2014 protests or, more broadly, against anyone who has directed or ordered the arrest or prosecution of a person primarily because of the person's legitimate exercise of freedom of expression or assembly\". The Act was extended in 2016 to expire on 31 December 2019. \n\nOn 2 February 2015, the United States Department of State imposed visa restrictions on current and former Venezuelan officials that were allegedly linked to presumed human rights abuses and political corruption. The visa restrictions also included family members, with the Department of State saying, \"We are sending a clear message that human rights abusers, those who profit from public corruption, and their families are not welcome in the United States\".\n\nObama issued Executive Order 13692 in March 2015, which blocks assets or imposes travel bans on those \"involved in or responsible for the erosion of human rights guarantees, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, use of violence and human rights violations and abuses in response to antigovernment protests, and arbitrary arrest and detention of antigovernment protestors, as well as significant public corruption by senior government officials in the country.\" Under EO 13692, the Obama administration sanctioned seven individuals, and the Trump administration has sanctioned 73 as of 8 March 2019.\n\nIn December 2011, Chávez already under treatment for cancer and wondered out loud: “would it be so strange that they’ve invented the technology to spread cancer and we won’t know about it for 50 years?” The Venezuelan president was speaking one day after Argentina's leftist president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, announced she had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. This was after three other prominent leftist Latin America leaders had been diagnosed with cancer: Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff; former Paraguayan president, Fernando Lugo, and the former Brazilian leader, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. \"The Guardian\" newspaper's Venezuela expert, Rory Carroll, has glibly categorized serious charges that Venezuela's late President Hugo Chavez Frias was assassinated by a United States-produced bio-weapon as being in the same league with \"conspiracy theorists who wonder about aliens at Roswell and NASA faking the moon landings\". A number of Venezuelan officials believe a hostile party covertly introduced an aggressive form of cancer into the 58-year-old president.\n\nOn 1 October 2013, the US ordered three Venezuelan diplomats out of the country in response to the Venezuelan government's decision to expel three US officials from Venezuela.\n\nOn 16 February 2014, President Maduro announced he had ordered another three US consular officials to leave the country, accusing them of conspiring against the government and aiding opposition protests. Maduro described the US statements that claimed to be concerned with rising tensions and protests and warned against Venezuela's possible arrest of the country's opposition leader as \"unacceptable\" and \"insolent.\" He said, \"I don't take orders from anyone in the world.\" On 25 February 2014, the United States responded by expelling three additional Venezuelan diplomats from the country.\n\nOn 28 May 2014, the United States House of Representatives passed the Venezuelan Human Rights and Democracy Protection Act (H.R. 4587; 113th Congress), a bill that would apply economic sanctions against Venezuelan officials who were involved in the mistreatment of protestors during the 2014 Venezuelan protests.\n\nIn December 2014, the US Congress passed Senate 2142 (the \"Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014\").\nOn 9 March 2015, the United States President, Barack Obama, signed and issued a presidential order declaring Venezuela a \"threat to its national security\" and ordered sanctions against seven Venezuelan officials. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro denounced the sanctions as an attempt to topple his socialist government. Washington said that the sanctions targeted individuals who were involved in the violation of Venezuelans' human rights, saying that \"we are deeply concerned by the Venezuelan government's efforts to escalate intimidation of its political opponents\".\n\nThe move was denounced by other Latin American countries. The Community of Latin American and Caribbean States issued a statement criticizing Washington's \"unilateral coercive measures against International Law.\" The Secretary-General of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), Ernesto Samper, said that the body rejects \"any attempt at internal or external interference that attempts to disrupt the democratic process in Venezuela.\"\n\nFollowing the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, Citgo, a US-based oil company owned by the Venezuelan government, gifted $500,000 toward Donald Trump's inauguration on 20 January 2017.\n\nOn 20 April 2017, the Venezuelan Government seized the General Motors Plant in the Venezuelan state of Zulia, causing the plant to close operations.\n\nOn 11 August 2017, President Trump said that he is \"not going to rule out a military option\" to confront the autocratic government of Nicolás Maduro and the deepening crisis in Venezuela. Venezuela's Defense Minister, Vladimir Padrino López, immediately criticized Trump for his statement, calling it \"an act of supreme extremism\" and \"an act of madness\". The Venezuelan Communications Minister, Ernesto Villegas, said Trump's words amounted to \"an unprecedented threat to national sovereignty\". President Maduro's son, Nicolás Maduro Guerra, stated during the 5th Constituent Assembly of Venezuela session that if the United States were to attack Venezuela, \"the rifles would arrive in New York, Mr. Trump, we would arrive and take the White House\". \n\nOn 23 January 2019, Maduro announced that Venezuela was breaking ties with the United States following President Trump's announcement of recognizing Juan Guaidó, the leader of Venezuela's National Assembly, as the interim President of Venezuela. Maduro said all US diplomats must leave within 72 hours, but Guaidó said that they should stay. Maduro later confirmed the closure of the Venezuelan Embassy and all consulates in the United States. In response Maduro ordered the expulsion of US diplomats, giving them 72 hours to leave Venezuela. The US said it would not close its embassy, stating their diplomatic relationship was with Guaidó's government, and holding Maduro responsible for the safety of its staff. On 26 January 2019, only hours before the deadline, the Maduro government backtracked on its expulsion order, giving US diplomats another 30 days.\nThe last U.S. diplomats in Caracas left Venezuela on Thursday, 14 March, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Their departure put an end to a U.S. presence in Venezuela, after president Maduro effectively broke off diplomatic relations with the U.S. in late January.\n\nOn 5 April 2019, the United States signed a protecting power agreement with Switzerland to represent its interests in Venezuela, however, the agreement is not yet operational as it has not been approved by Maduro's government due to the United States rejecting Maduro's government's proposal to have Turkey as its protecting power as the United States only recognizes Guaidó as interim president. In the meantime, the United States has instead established a \"Venezuela Affairs Unit\" section at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, Colombia to serves as an interim diplomatic office to Venezuela.\n\nIn the spring of 2020 the United States stepped up pressure on Maduro. On 26 March the United States accused President Nicolás Maduro of narcoterrorism and offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his arrest. In response, Maduro called US President Donald Trump a “racist cowboy”. A few days later, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab summoned opposition leader Juan Guaidó for questioning for an alleged \"attempted coup d'etat\" and \"attempted assassination\". On 31 March, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that sanctions did not apply to humanitarian aid during the health emergency and that the United States would lift its sanctions if Maduro agreed to organize elections that did not include Maduro in a period of six to twelve months and reiterated U.S. support for Guaidó. Then on 1 April President Trump announced that he was sending anti-drug Navy ships and AWACS planes to the region near Venezuela in one of the largest military build-ups in the region since the 1989 invasion of Panama to remove General Manuel Noriega from power.\n\nDespite the continually strained ties between the two governments, 82% of Venezuelans viewed the U.S. positively in 2002, though this view declined down to 62% in 2014 (per the Pew Research Global Attitudes Project). The Gallup Global Leadership Report indicates that as of 2013, 35% of Venezuelans approve of United States' global leadership, and 35% disapprove. The Spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey by Pew Research Center found that 35% of the Venezuelan population views the United States unfavorable and 47% view it favorably.\"\n\nIn 1960, the UNITAS naval exercises and in-port training involving several countries in North, South and Central America were conducted for the first time in Venezuelan territorial waters in support of the Cold War U.S. policy. Venezuela is an active member of SICOFAA.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2071283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071283", "title": "Denver Mint", "text": "Denver Mint\n\nThe Denver Mint is a branch of the United States Mint that struck its first coins on February 1, 1906. The mint is still operating and producing coins for circulation, as well as mint sets and commemorative coins. Coins produced at the Denver Mint bear a D mint mark (not to be confused with the mark of the Dahlonega Mint). The Denver Mint is the single largest producer of coins in the world.\n\nThe predecessors of the Denver Mint were the men of Clark, Gruber and Company. During the Pikes Peak Gold Rush, they coined gold dust brought from the gold fields by the miners. In 1858, Austin M. Clark, Milton E. Clark and Emanuel Henry Gruber founded a brokerage firm in Leavenworth, Kansas, and then established an office in Denver at the beginning of the Colorado Gold Rush. Desiring to save on shipping and insurance costs associated with shipping gold back east, the firm opened a private mint. On 25 July 1860, the mint opened in a two-story brick building on the corner of Market and 16th Streets, minting $10 gold pieces at the rate of \"fifteen or twenty coins a minute\". \"On the face is a representation of the peak, its base surrounded by a forest of timber and 'Pikes Peak Gold' encircling the summit. Immediately under its base is the word 'Denver', and beneath it 'Ten D.'. On the reverse is the American Eagle encircled by the name of the firm 'Clark, Gruber & Co.', and beneath the date, '1860'.\"\n\nA $20 gold coin was added, \"the weight will be greater, but the value the same as the United States coin of like denomination\". A $5 and a $2.5 gold coin were added, with production reaching $18,000 per week. On the front was the \"head of the Goddess of Liberty surrounded by thirteen stars, with \"Clark & Company\" in the tiara. \"Pikes's Peak Gold, Denver\" was on the other side, with \"5D.\" or \"2 1/2 D.\"\n\nIn the almost three years of operation, they minted $594,305 worth of Pike's Peak Gold in the form of gold coins. Additionally, they purchased 77,000 troy ounces of raw gold, and shipped \"large amounts of dust\" to the Philadelphia Mint. The building, assaying and minting equipment was formally bought by the US Treasury in April 1863. Clark, Gruber & Co. remained a bank until bought by the First National Bank of Denver in 1865.\n\nEstablished by an Act of Congress on April 21, 1862, the United States Mint at Denver opened for business in late 1863 as a United States Assay Office. Operations began in the facilities of Clark, Gruber and Company, located at 16th and Market Streets and acquired by the government for $25,000, which it was simply able to print off at the location.\n\nUnlike Clark, Gruber and Company, though, the Denver plant performed no coinage of gold as first intended. One reason given by the Director of the Mint for the lack of coinage at Denver was, \"…the hostility of the Indian tribes along the routes, doubtless instigated by rebel emissaries (there being a Civil War) and bad white men.\"\n\nGold and nuggets brought there by miners from the surrounding area were accepted by the Assay Office for melting, assaying, and stamping of cast gold bars. The bars were then returned to the depositors as imparted bars stamped with the weight and fineness of the gold. Most of the gold came from the rich beds of placer gold found in the streams and first discovered in 1858, the same year Denver was founded.\n\nWhen the supply of gold was exhausted from the streams, the emphasis turned to lode mining, uncovering veins of ore with a high percentage of gold and silver. By 1859, the yearly value of the gold and silver deposited at the Assay Office was over $5.6 million. During its early years as an Assay Office, the Denver plant was the city's most substantial structure.\n\nThe United States Treasury did not expand its smelting and refining operations at the same rate as the discovery and production of gold. In 1872 a group of businessmen led by Judge Hiram Bond (formerly one of the largest brokers on the New York Gold Exchange), Joseph Miner and Denver Mayor Joseph E. Bates set up a firm Denver Smelting and Refining Works which built an independent complementary plant which processed ore into ingots which were then assayed, weighed and stamped by the Denver Mint.\n\nThere was new hope for branch mint status when Congress provided for the establishment of a mint at Denver for gold and silver coin production. The site for the new mint at West Colfax and Delaware streets was purchased on April 22, 1896, for approximately $60,000. Construction began in 1897.\n\nAppropriations to complete and equip the plant were insufficient, and the transfer of assay operations to the new building were delayed until September 1, 1904. Coinage operations finally began on February 1, 1906, advancing the status of the Denver facility to Branch Mint. In addition, before the new machinery to be used at the Mint was installed for use, it was first sent to the St. Louis Exposition of 1904 for display. Silver coins were minted in Denver for the first time in 1906. During the first year, 167 million coins were produced, including $20 gold (double eagle) coins, $10 gold (eagle) coins, $5 gold (half eagle) coins, and assorted denominations of silver coins.\n\n\n\n"}

As of 2009, Boras remains in the top 10 in school history in multiple offensive categories. Boras was inducted into the Pacific Athletics Hall of Fame in 1995, and the baseball team's annual \"Most Improved Player\" award is named in his honor. Following his college career, Boras played four years of minor league baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs organizations. Boras made the Florida State League All-Star team in 1976, but knee problems shortened his career and he retired with a career batting average of .288. Boras received his Doctor of Pharmacy degree from the University of the Pacific in 1977.\n\nFollowing his playing career, Boras returned to the University of the Pacific, earning his Juris Doctor degree from the university's McGeorge School of Law in 1982. After law school, Boras worked as an associate in the pharmaceutical defense department of the Chicago firm Rooks, Pitts & Poust (now Dykema Gossett), defending drug companies against class-action lawsuits.\n\nBoras's start as an agent came representing Mike Fischlin, a former major league shortstop for the Cleveland Indians, and Bill Caudill, a former minor league teammate and closer for the Seattle Mariners, both of whom now work for Boras. By 1980, he had decided his calling was as a baseball agent. In 1983, Boras negotiated one of the largest contracts in baseball history for Caudill ($7.5 million), and not long afterward Boras left his law firm job to represent players full-time.\n\nToday, Boras is the president and owner of the Boras Corporation, a baseball-only sports agency. In 2014, the Boras Corporation was named by Forbes magazine as the most valuable single-sport agency in the world.\n\nBoras and his company Boras Corporation have become known for record-setting contracts for their free agent and amateur draft clients. Boras was the first baseball agent to negotiate contracts in excess of $50 million (Greg Maddux, five years, $57.5 million in 1997), $100 million (Kevin Brown, seven years, $105 million in 1998) and $200 million (Alex Rodriguez, 10 years, $252 million in 2000).\n\nBoras also represents many of the elite players in each year's amateur draft and has been a strong advocate for increasing the amount of money they receive. Boras's first record-setting contract for a drafted player was $150,000 for Tim Belcher in 1983. Since then, Boras's clients have regularly pushed draft compensation higher, starting with Andy Benes in 1988 ($247,500), Ben McDonald in 1989 ($1.01 million guarantee, including a $350,000 bonus), Todd Van Poppel in 1990 ($1.2 million guarantee, including a $500,000 bonus) and Brien Taylor in 1991 ($1.55 million) and continuing through J. D. Drew ($8.5 million in 1998) and Mark Teixeira ($9.5 million in 2001). In 2009, Boras's clients broke several draft records, led by Stephen Strasburg, who surpassed the $15 million barrier with the largest contract in draft history ($15.1 million), Donavan Tate, who received the largest signing bonus ever given to a high school player ($6.25 million), and Jacob Turner, who received the largest signing bonus ever given to a high school pitcher ($4.7 million).\n\nThe Boras Corporation operates out of a $20 million, , two-story, glass-and-steel building in Newport Beach, California The corporate headquarters includes a kitchen, laundry room, gym, shower, lounge, 70 flat-screen televisions and a large patio with a tall waterfall, fire pit and barbecue. Boras' subsidiary companies include Boras Marketing (memorabilia, marketing, and endorsements) and the Boras Sports Training Institute (strength/conditioning and sports psychology). Many of Boras's 75-person staff are former major leaguers, including Bob Brower, Don Carman, Bill Caudill, Scott Chiamparino, Mike Fischlin, Calvin Murray, Jeff Musselman, Domingo Ramos and Kurt Stillwell, and the company has scouts spread across the United States, Asia and Latin America. Boras's staff also includes an MIT-trained economist, a former NASA computer engineer, three lawyers, five personal trainers, an investment team (although Boras' firm does not provide investment services for clients), a sports psychologist, a 14-person research staff and an employee charged with watching each day's games and sending information to Boras.\n\nOver the course of his 31 years as a sports agent, Boras has represented hundreds of players on all 30 major league teams and has participated in dozens of high-profile negotiations. Boras's specialty is the record-breaking contract, which he says is the most difficult to achieve because it then provides an \"umbrella\" from which other players can benefit. Boras is well known for identifying sources of leverage for his clients and using them for the clients' advantage. This has included advising draft picks to return to school instead of signing, taking advantage of the right to go to salary arbitration hearings, and advising superstars to wait for free agency instead of taking \"hometown discount\" contracts. This does not endear him to fans, who regularly side with their favorite teams and not individual players. Boras, however, has said his job is to represent his clients' interests, even if it means weathering public criticism. Boras' innovative strategies have benefited his clients enough that Major League Baseball has changed its rules in response to his actions on multiple occasions. This has led to descriptions of Boras ranging from \"baseball's most hated man\" (from management's perspective) to the man \"players can't afford to live without.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ denotes Hall of Fame inductee\n\n"}

It was directed by Jonathan Demme.\n\nThe movie was originally released as Citizens Band, and was later released in an edited version as \"Handle with Care\".\nIn the film, all of the cast of characters are known by their CB \"handles\" (nicknames).\n\nA paperback novelization of the film written by E.M. Corder was published by Pocket Books in 1977.\n\nPaul Le Mat plays \"Spider,\" a young man who makes a meager living repairing CB radios and spends his spare time volunteering with REACT International. He lives with his father, an irascible retired truck driver (Roberts Blossom) whose CB handle is \"Papa Thermodyne.\"\n\n\"Chrome Angel\" (played by Charles Napier) is an interstate truck driver named Harold, passing through the outskirts of town during bad weather when he is injured in an accident. After Chrome Angel issues an emergency call over CB Channel 9, Spider rescues him, taking him to the hospital.\n\nDuring his recovery in town, Harold is visited by local prostitute Debbie (alias \"Hot Coffee\"—played by Alix Elias), who solicits customers over the CB radio. Chrome Angel has two wives, Connie (Marcia Rodd) who calls herself \"Portland Angel\" as she is from Portland, Oregon, and Joyce (alias \"Dallas Angel\"—Ann Wedgeworth) who lives in Dallas, Texas, neither of whom knows he is married to the other. Both arrive in town at the same time while he is recovering. They not only discover that he has been seeing Hot Coffee, but during a conversation the two strike up in the bus station, meeting for the first time, they discover for the first time that they are married to the same man.\n\nSpider's former fiancee, Pam (\"Electra\"—Candy Clark), is a cheerleading coach and physical education teacher who, unbeknownst to Spider, has a hobby of her own, striking up erotic conversations over the CB with teenage boys. She is also romantically interested in Spider's older brother, Dean (Bruce McGill), who goes by the CB handle \"Blood.\"\n\nAfter Spider's activities with REACT are seriously disrupted by a gang of local kids holding a frivolous conversation on Channel 9, which is reserved for emergency communications, he decides to go on a singlehanded county-wide crusade to shut down illegal CB stations, such as those using unlawful linear amplifiers. Spider's targets include \"The Red Baron\" (Harry Northup), a neo-Nazi who uses a high-powered CB base station to broadcast white supremacist monologues, and \"The Hustler,\" a teenage boy who reads pornography aloud over the air. Spider and a partner from REACT begin a spree of cutting antenna cables, intimidating offenders by visiting their homes and claiming to be Federal Communications Commission (FCC) officials, and other vigilante acts in the hopes of cleaning up the CB airwaves.\n\nAs Chrome Angel's two wives learn they are both married to the same man, and Spider learns that his former fiancee is the infamous Electra, much of the last part of the film consists of the myriad complicated friendships and odd romantic relationships that finally come to a head. Finally, the whole town comes together in a search and rescue effort after Papa Thermodyne suddenly disappears.\n\n\nThe film's initial release resulted in disappointing box office results which led Paramount to reconsider its campaign and distribution strategy, including renaming the film to reduce the CB radio connection and as apparently some thought that the word \"Band\" in the title indicated it was a musical.\n\nThe film was renamed \"Handle with Care\" for its New York Film Festival showing on September 30, 1977.\n\nThe renaming did not boost its box office and it grossed just $815,530 in the United States and Canada.\n\n\"Handle with Care\" currently holds a 100% rating at Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 7.9/10 among the critics.\n\nJohn Simon wrote of Citizen's Band \"a lovely, hilarious, semisatirical folk comedy, only needing a better ending.\"\n"}

He is best known for his role as Kid Curry in the ABC television series \"Alias Smith and Jones\".\n\nMurphy was born in Jonesboro, Arkansas to Nadine (née Steele) and Benjamin E. Castleberry. When his mother remarried in 1956, Ben was adopted by his stepfather, Patrick Henry Murphy. Murphy grew up in Clarendon Hills, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.\n\nAn alumnus of St. Procopius Academy in Lisle, Illinois, predecessor to today's Benet Academy, he attended eight colleges before deciding to pursue an acting career.\n\nMurphy appeared in a supporting role in \"The Name of the Game\", a series featuring a rotating leading cast including Tony Franciosa, Gene Barry, and Robert Stack. Murphy played a semi regular role as 'Joseph Sample' assistant to Robert Stack's leading character 'Dan Farrell' in Stack's segments of the show.\n\nFrom 1971–73, he starred in \"Alias Smith and Jones\" with Pete Duel (1971–72) and Roger Davis (1972–73). After \"Alias Smith and Jones\", Murphy joined Lorne Greene in the 1973 ABC crime drama \"Griff\". He played detective S.

Since the release of the \"Zelda\" Game & Watch game in August 1989, several LCD games based upon the theme of \"The Legend of Zelda\" have been licensed by Nintendo to be released for both Japanese and foreign markets. While \"Zelda\" (Game & Watch) was both developed and manufactured by Nintendo, later LCD games would only be licensed by Nintendo. \"The Legend of Zelda\" game watch (October 1989) is an LCD wristwatch game produced by Nelsonic as part of their Nelsonic Game Watch series, and is an LCD fighting video game licensed by Nintendo and produced by Epoch Co. for the platform, and released only in Japan.\n\nThe \"Zelda\" Game & Watch (model number \"ZL-65\") is a multi-screen Game & Watch system developed by Nintendo and released in North America in 1989. Its gameplay was heavily inspired by Nintendo Entertainment System game \"\", and it featured an original story described on the manual.\n\nUnlike the other LCD games, this was made by Nintendo and appeared on a Nintendo platform. The handheld console would be Nintendo's penultimate release before the release of the Game Boy (the last being \"Mario The Juggler\").\n\nPlayers control Link and fight through labyrinth chambers on the Game & Watch's lower screen. In the labyrinth chambers, Link faces Poe-like Ghosts, up to four Stalfoses, and a Moblin-like Goblin mini-boss. Stalfoses and Ghosts cannot be defeated and must be dodged and blocked with the shield respectively. The Goblin must be killed in order to complete the lower-screen labyrinth. Once the Labyrinth is complete, stairs appear and the action shifts to the Dragon's Lair in the upper screen. Here Link battles a dragon on the right hand side of the screen while avoiding its fire and tail attacks. The left hand side of the screen displays the dungeon map and items such as the Tomahawk item—unique to this game—that Link gains while fighting the dragon. Upon defeating the dragon, the game starts again with quicker enemies and retaining the player's high score. This Game & Watch game also features a continue button that allows players to continue the game in the event of the player's death.\n\nEight unruly dragons are creating havoc in the world. After they kidnap Princess Zelda, it is up to Link to defeat them and rescue the princess. The dragons have imprisoned Zelda behind a seal that requires all 8 pieces of the triforce to unlock. After defeating each dragon, Link gains one piece of the triforce.\n\nThe \"Zelda\" Game & Watch was developed by Gunpei Yokoi and Nintendo R&D1.\n\n\"Zelda\" is thought to have pushed the limits of what is possible on the Game & Watch LCD format, though the gameplay is far simpler than the NES original. The game was noted in particular by \"Famitsu\" as having achieved the excitement and role-playing game-feel of the original series, however the game was criticized for being too easy if the player attained too many power-ups during play. \"Retro Gamer\" rated it Number 5 in their \"Perfect Ten Games\" for Game & Watch, noting that \"it did capture the feel of the world it was played in.\"\n\nToday the game frequently fetches high prices on the secondary market with auction values ranging from £25 to £60.\n\nIn 1998, Toymax Inc. was licensed to make the Mini Classics series, keychain-sized remakes of the Game & Watch series, one of them being \"Zelda\". It has a significantly smaller screen size. This keychain version, along with \"Oil Panic\" and \"Donkey Kong\", was only released in Europe. By as early as 2007, Stadlbauer and It's Outrageous! began distributing the Mini Classics version in select locations within the United States, using art from \"\" and \"\".\n\nIn October 2002, Nintendo included a port of the game as a hidden unlockable extra in \"Game & Watch Gallery 4\" for the Game Boy Advance. This \"Zelda\" minigame is the most difficult to unlock, requiring the player to have beaten all other games (and to have earned all 160 stars). Due to limitations of the GBA hardware, the visuals were changed. To fit everything on-screen at once, the screen where the action is not taking place is reduced to about two-thirds of that of the original height.\n\"The Legend of Zelda\" game watch is a multi-purpose wristwatch made by Nelsonic (re-released for European markets by Zeon in 1992) as part of their Game Watch line. It tells the time and allows players to play a game. It runs on one battery, size #364 (black watch) or #392 (red watch). The game is based on the NES's original \"The Legend of Zelda\", and it was manufactured in black, red, white and pink colors.\n\nThe player controls Link as he defeats enemies in caves to retrieve pieces of the Triforce. The game consists of four levels with four cavernous rooms each. In each cave, Link has to collect a boomerang and sword to defeat several enemies. Defeating all of the enemies in the cave grants Link a key to the next room which, on entering, causes Link to lose all of his weapons so that he can collect them again in the new cave. Once all enemies in the fourth cave are killed, the Dragon—the level's boss—appears. After Link defeats the Dragon, a Triforce fragment appears, giving him access to the next level. After collecting all four pieces of the Triforce, the game ends.\n\nPlot details for the game are scant to nonexistent. According to the manual, Link enters a cave where he is immediately attacked by Iron Balls, Ferocious bats, and fire breathing Dragons. After obtaining weapons to defeat the enemies presented in each of the 4 caves per level, Link finds a key and fights the fire-breathing Dragon that serves as the boss of the level. When the Dragon is defeated he leaves Link with a piece of the Triforce. After progressing through all 4 levels, Link collects all 4 pieces of Triforce and wins.\n\nThe game was well received by critics for its stylishness as an article of clothing, however the game was considered to have been largely unsuccessful in evoking the original NES title. While the game was praised for its ability to give the illusion of multiple screens, the gameplay was criticized for its simplicity and the game as a whole was found to be \"unrelated to its namesake\" and generally \"very poor.\" Positive aspects touched on by reviewers included the game's relatively low price and its portability.\nIn 1992, Epoch Co. was licensed to print a series of Nintendo-themed cards for their Barcode Battler II platform. Card sets were printed with both \"Mario\" and \"Zelda\" themes. Functioning similarly to an LCD e-Reader, the Barcode Battler II required players to swipe barcodes printed on cards across a visual input in order to enter characters, enemies, items, and spells into the console. The \"Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce\" set features 30 and is based on the SNES's original \"\".\n\nPlayed in the C2 mode on Barcode Battler II, \"Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce\" set allows the player to play as either Warrior or Wizard. After choosing the hero card (either \"Link\" or \"Link(Magic)\"), the player scans it into the Barcode Battler II where its stats are recorded and displayed on the LCD screen. For each battle, the players choose an enemy and swipe it in to fight against the hero. The battle is conducted based on an algorithm within the Barcode Battler, and the results of the fight are displayed in new character stats on the LCD screen. If the enemy is defeated, the enemy card is discarded and the next enemy card is swiped in. At any point between fights, the player may choose to swipe in and discard one of the ten item cards. Item cards provide a variety of benefits to the hero including boosting weapon stats, restoring life, and increasing defensive stats. Discarded item cards may be returned to the player from the discard pile upon defeating a Wizard enemy. After all other enemies are defeated, the player must swipe the \"Ganon\" card to fight the final boss. If Ganon is defeated, the player has won.\n\nGanon has transformed the sacred land into the \"World of Darkness\" and is now plotting to take over the \"World of Light\" (i.e. Hyrule). To achieve this end, the evil priest Agahnim strives to sacrifice the daughters of the seven sages to break the seal holding Ganon in check.\n\nLink must venture through the Worlds of Light and Darkness to defeat Ganon. Along the way numerous puzzles and monsters await.\n\nBoth the \"Zelda no Densetsu\" card set and the \"Mario\" card set were released as Nintendo-licensed special-edition cards for the Barcode Battler II. The system itself was popular in Japan, inspiring the creation of a comic book series as well as the commission of products for Falcom and NTV.\n"}

According to \"Billboard\", \"nobody has released more consistently excellent blues albums than Atlanta's Tinsley Ellis. He sings like a man possessed and wields a mean lead guitar.\"\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" said, \"On assertive originals and standards by the likes of Jimmy Reed and Junior Wells, Atlanta's Tinsley Ellis unleashes feral blues guitar. Nonstop gigging has sharpened his six-string to a razor's edge…his eloquence dazzles…he also achieves pyrotechnics that rival early Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton.\"\n\nHis love for electric blues grew by listening to British Invasion bands such as the Yardbirds, the Animals, Cream, and the Rolling Stones. Inspired by a live appearance by B.B. King, he was determined to become a blues guitarist. In 1975, he played with the Haygood Band while attending Emory University near Atlanta. Two years later, already an accomplished musician, he returned to Atlanta and joined his first professional blues band, the Alley Cats, a group that included Preston Hubbard of the Fabulous Thunderbirds. Ellis graduated from Emory in 1979 with a degree in history. In 1981, he formed the Heartfixers, with the singer and harmonica player Chicago Bob Nelson. The group recorded three albums for the small Landslide record label, one with the singer, Nappy Brown before breaking up in 1988. The same year, Ellis signed a recording contract with Chicago's Alligator Records.\n\nHis debut solo album on Alligator Records, \"Georgia Blue\", was released in 1988. Alligator then reissued two of his earlier CDs, \"Cool On It\" and \"Tore Up\" (featuring Nappy Brown). Ellis' next four releases were \"Fanning the Flames\" (1989), \"Trouble Time\" (1992), \"Storm Warning\" (1994), and \"Fire It Up\" (1997). Artists including Peter Buck (of R.E.M.), Derek Trucks, and Chuck Leavell joined him in the studio. He worked with the record producers, Eddy Offord and Tom Dowd.\nEllis' reputation and media coverage continued to grow. He appeared on NBC-TV Sports during the network's 1996 Summer Olympics coverage.\n\nEllis shifted to Capricorn Records in 2000 and released \"Kingpin\". In 2002 he joined Telarc Records, producing two CDs: \"Hell or High Water\" and \"The Hard Way\". All the while Ellis never stopped touring. \"A musician never got famous by staying home,\" Ellis says. Ellis claims to have performed live, at least once, in all 50 of the United States.\n\nHe returned to Alligator Records in 2005 with the live album, \"\". In 2007 he released the studio album, \"Moment of Truth\", followed in 2009 with \"Speak No Evil\". Ellis continues to tour over 150 nights a year around the world.\n\nHe has shared stages with Warren Haynes, Widespread Panic, the Allman Brothers Band, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimmy Thackery, Otis Rush, Willie Dixon, Son Seals, Koko Taylor, Albert Collins and Buddy Guy.\n\nIn early 2013, Ellis was a part of the 'Blues at the Crossroads 2' tour which celebrated the music of Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. The tour also included Kim Wilson and the Fabulous Thunderbirds, James Cotton, Bob Margolin and Jody Williams.\n\nAlso in 2013, Ellis launched his own label, Heartfixer Music, and has since released several albums: the all instrumental \"Get It!\", \"Midnight Blue\", \"Tough Love\" and, in 2016, \"Red Clay Soul\".\n\nIn 2014, Ellis was a guest performer on Eli Cook's album, \"Primitive Son\".\n\nIn 2017, Ellis launched a new side project called Tinsley Ellis Blues Is Dead, in which he performs the blues and R&B songs recorded by Grateful Dead and other Fillmore era acts.\n\nCommenting on Ellis's latest album, \"Ice Cream in Hell\", AllMusic stated \"On Ice Cream in Hell, Ellis' songwriting and singing finally match the prowess in his playing, and we are all richer for it.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Two kilometres to the west rises Mount Gable where, according to legend, the hordes of Firbolg gathered on the hilltop before their clash with the Tuatha Dé Danann at the Battle of Moytura. \n\nClonbur also contains the ruins of the Petersburgh Estate, seat of the Lynch family, one of whose members, John Lynch, was a signatory of the American Declaration of Independence. In more recent times, it was owned by the Guinness family.\n\nIn the Ross Hill cemetery of stands the ruins of Teampall Brendain. The ruin is sited within an ancient oval enclosure known as a Caiseal or Cashel. The western end of the ruin is of early Christian origin and in the trabeated doorway can clearly be seen the inclined jambs so distinctive of that era. This edifice replaced a wooden and less durable structure which was the Navigator's original monastic settlement on the site.\n\nWithin 30 meters of the western doorway is a curiosity locally known as The Ogham Stone.\nThe site, in the Ross Hill estate, was once the property of the unpopular Earl of Leitrim.\nThe estate later became the property of the Guinness family.\n\nOne of a series of five fortifications from Ballinrobe to Ballindonage, it was originally owned by the O'Kynes. In 1571 it was seized for the Crown by Fitton, the then President of Connacht. For a period the de Burgos held it and later gave it to the MacDonnells (Scottish mercenaries) as service booty or \"bonnacht\". Eventually it passed from Sir Richard O'Donnell to Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness and so became part of the Guinness estate.\n\nArchitecturally, the castle has some puzzling features. The trabeated doorway with its inclined jambs pre-dates the rest of the structure by some 900 years. Certain sections of the stonework are not bonded together as a unit, a feature which suggests later additions to the original building.\n\nLocated at the foot of Mount Gable, three miles west of Clonbur in County Galway. Lough Coolin is accessible via the villages of Ballyveane and Kilbeg Upper. Beside the lake are the stone cottage ruins of an old village. The lake was renowned for white trout until the early 1960s when pike were added to the lake by a local fisherman. Pike and perch are now the only fish in the lake. A stream from the Lough Coolin flows into Lough Mask. Coolin Lake provides fresh water for the village of Clonbur.\n\nMount Gable (1370 feet) is a hill which dominates the isthmus between Lough Corrib and Lough Mask and overlooks one of the major routes into Connemara from the east. The starting point for a walk is approximately 2 km from the village of Clonbur. It provides a backdrop for Lough Coolin. Views of both Lough Mask and Lough Corrib can be had from the top of Mount Gable. Mount Gable is accessible through the villages of Ballyveane and Kilbeg Upper.\n\n\n"}

Its headquarters was in Geneva, Switzerland. They are now merged into the World Communion of Reformed Churches.\n\nThe World Alliance of Reformed Churches (WARC) was created in 1970 by a merger of two bodies, the Alliance of the Reformed Churches holding the Presbyterian System, representing Presbyterian and Reformed churches, and the International Congregational Council. The Alliance of the Reformed Churches holding the Presbyterian System was formed in London in 1875. It held councils which had no legislative authority but great moral weight. In them the various Augustinian non-prelatical and in general presbyterial bodies found representation. They were upward of 90 in number, scattered all over the world, with 25,000,000 adherents. The published reports of the proceedings of these councils contain much valuable matter of all kinds, as papers are read, statistics presented, and many speeches made. Councils were held at London, 1875; Edinburgh, 1877; Philadelphia, 1880; Belfast, 1884; London, 1888; Toronto, 1892; Glasgow, 1896; Washington, 1899.\n\nThe World Alliance of Reformed Churches had 218 member churches in 107 countries around the world, with some 75 million members. Churches represented in the WARC include Congregational, Presbyterian, Reformed and United churches which have historical roots in the 16th century Reformation.\n\nThe WARC Secretariat was located in the Ecumenical Centre in Geneva, Switzerland. It works closely with the World Council of Churches.\n\nIn 2000, the WAR was critical of \"Dominus Iesus\", the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's document, and considered calling off a formal dialogue in Rome that year.\n\nOn 1 February 2006, Clifton Kirkpatrick, president of the WARC, and Douwe Visser, president of the Reformed Ecumenical Council (REC), said in a joint letter, \"We rejoice in the work of the Holy Spirit which we believe has led us to recommend that the time has come to bring together the work of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and the Reformed Ecumenical Council into one body that will strengthen the unity and witness of Reformed Christians.\" The resulting new organisation is the World Communion of Reformed Churches.\n\nWARC presidents are elected for 7 years at every General Council (held every 7 years):\nFrom 1970 to 1989 the General Secretary was Rev. Edmond Perret from Switzerland. In 1988 the Executive Committee meeting in Belfast, N. Ireland elected Rev. Dr. Milan Opočenský (Czech Rep.) who held office until 2000. In 2000 Rev. Dr. Setri Nyomi (Ghana) became the General Secretary of WARC, and later WCRC.\n\nThe WARC brings together more than 75 million Christians in over 100 countries around the world.\n\nMember churches are Congregational, Presbyterian, Reformed and united and uniting churches.\n\nMost of these are in the southern hemisphere with many being religious minorities in their countries.\n\n\n"}

The Talos used radar beam riding for guidance to the vicinity of its target, and semiactive radar homing (SARH) for terminal guidance. The array of four antenna which surround the nose are SARH receivers which functioned as a continuous wave interferometer. Initial thrust was provided by a solid rocket booster for launch and a Bendix ramjet for flight to the target with the warhead serving as the ramjet's compressor.\nTalos was the end product of Operation Bumblebee, the Navy's 16-year surface-to-air missile development program for protection against guided anti-ship missiles like Henschel Hs 293 glide bombs, Fritz X, and kamikaze aircraft. The Talos was the primary effort behind the Bumblebee project, but was not the first missile the program developed; the RIM-2 Terrier was the first to enter service. The Talos was originally designated SAM-N-6, and was redesignated RIM-8 in 1963. The airframe structure was manufactured by McDonnell Aircraft in St. Louis; final assembly was by Bendix Missile Systems in Mishawaka, Indiana.\n\nThe Talos saw relatively limited use due to its large size and dual radar antenna system; there were few ships that could accommodate the large missiles with the AN/SPW-2 missile guidance radar and the AN/SPG-49 target illumination and tracking radar. The 9.9-meter-long, 3½-tonne missile was similar in size to a fighter aircraft. The Talos Mark 7 Guided Missile Launching System (GMLS) was installed in three s (converted light cruisers) with 16 missiles in a ready-service magazine and up to 30 missiles and boosters in a storage area above the main deck. Nuclear-powered and three s (converted \"Baltimore\"-class heavy cruisers) carried Mark 12 Guided Missile Launching Systems fed from a 52-round magazine below the main deck.\n\nThe initial SAM-N-6b/RIM-8A had an effective range of about 50 nm, and a conventional warhead. The SAM-N-6bW/RIM-8B was a RIM-8A with a nuclear warhead; terminal guidance was judged unnecessary for a nuclear warhead, so the SARH antenna was omitted. The SAM-N-6b1/RIM-8C was introduced in 1960 and had double the range, and a more effective conventional continuous-rod warhead. The RIM-8D was the nuclear-warhead version of the -8C. The SAM-N-6c/RIM-8E \"Unified Talos\" had a warhead that could be swapped while embarked, eliminating the need to waste magazine capacity carrying dedicated nuclear-tipped variants. The RIM-8E also carried an improved continuous-wave terminal homing seeker, and had a higher ceiling reach-out. Some RIM-8Cs were retrofitted with the new seeker, and designated RIM-8F. The RIM-8G and RIM-8J had further radar homing improvements and a new fuel that extended the range to 130 nm.\n\nThe surface-to-air versions also saw action in Vietnam, a total of four MiGs being shot down by \"Chicago\" and \"Long Beach\". On May 23, 1968, a Talos fired from USS \"Long Beach\" shot down a Vietnamese MiG at a range of about 65 miles. This was the first downing of a hostile aircraft by a missile fired from a ship. The hit also destroyed a second MiG which flew through the debris. In September 1968 \"Long Beach\" scored another MiG destroyed at a range of 61 miles. On May 9, 1972 \"Chicago\"s forward Talos battery scored a long-range kill on a MiG. The Talos missile also had surface-to-surface capabilities.\n\nThe RIM-8H Talos-ARM was a dedicated anti-radar homing missile for use against shore-based radar stations. Initial testing of the RIM-8H was performed in 1965, and soon after it was deployed in Vietnam on \"Chicago\", \"Oklahoma City\", and \"Long Beach\", attacking North Vietnamese SAM radars. \"Oklahoma City\" fired the first successful RIM-8H combat shot in US Navy history in early 1972. It was also the first combat surface-to-surface missile shot in US Navy history.\n\n\n\"Long Beach\" had her Talos launcher removed in 1978. Talos was phased out of fleet service with the decommissioning of in 1979, though the \"Albany\"-class ships carrying the system soldiered on a few more years with the launchers left in place until they were retired in 1980. After 21 years of fleet service, the missile was replaced by the RIM-67 Standard missile, which was fired from the smaller Mk10 launcher.\n\nTwo Talos missiles are on display at the Military Honor Park located near the entrance of the South Bend International Airport in South Bend, Indiana.\n\nA Talos missile is displayed in the atrium of the South Bend Regional Airport (historically known as Bendix Field).\n\nAnother example can be seen at the Patriots Point Naval & Maritime Museum, located at Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.\n\nA Talos Missile can also be seen on display at the Muskogee War Memorial Park located in Muskogee, Oklahoma.\n\nA Talos missile is on display at Naval Weapons Station Yorktown in Yorktown, Virginia.\n\nA Talos missile is on display at The US Navy's Guided Missile School at Dam Neck, in Virginia Beach, Virginia, just outside of the main building of the NAVGMSCOL.\n\nTwo Talos missiles are on display, in launch position, on the stern of at the Buffalo & Erie County Naval & Military Park located in Buffalo, New York.\n\nA Talos missile and booster were on display at Rita Blanca Park (home of the XIT Rodeo & Reunion) in Dalhart Texas, at least from 1981 or earlier, but as of 2017 had been removed.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2071367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071367", "title": "Mark Teixeira", "text": "Mark Teixeira\n\nMark Charles Teixeira ( ; born April 11, 1980), nicknamed Tex, is an American former professional baseball first baseman who played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the Texas Rangers, Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and New York Yankees. Before his professional career, he played college baseball at Georgia Tech, where in 2000 he won the Dick Howser Trophy as the national collegiate baseball player of the year. One of the most prolific switch hitters in MLB history, Teixeira was an integral part of the Yankees' 27th World Series championship in 2009, leading the American League (AL) in home runs and runs batted in (RBI) while finishing second in the Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) balloting. Teixeira was a three-time All-Star, won five Gold Glove Awards and three Silver Slugger Awards, and also holds the all-time major league record for most games with a home run from both sides of the plate, with 14. He was the fifth switch hitter in MLB history to reach 400 home runs.\n\nDrafted fifth overall by the Texas Rangers in 2001, Teixeira made his MLB debut on Opening Day in 2003, and hit 26 home runs as a rookie. He hit career-highs of 43 home runs and 144 RBI in 2005. The centerpiece of consecutive mid-season trades in 2007 and 2008, the Rangers first sent him to the Braves for a prospect package centered around Elvis Andrus and Matt Harrison. He was later traded in July 2008 to the Los Angeles Angels, where he played for half a season and lost in the first round of the playoffs. In December 2008, he agreed to a lucrative eight-year contract with the Yankees, contributing his most productive season in pinstripes the following year. Injuries limited his effectiveness afterward, including a calf strain in 2012, early season-ending wrist surgery in 2013, various ailments in 2014, a shin fracture in 2015, and neck spasms and torn cartilage in 2016. Teixeira retired at the conclusion of the 2016 season and contract with the Yankees. In each season from 2004 to 2011, Teixeira hit at least 30 home runs with 100 RBI.\n\nMark Teixeira grew up in Severna Park, Maryland, the son of Margaret \"Margy\" Canterna and John Teixeira. He attended Mount Saint Joseph High School in Baltimore, where he played for the school's varsity baseball team, and was teammates with Gavin Floyd. His paternal grandfather emigrated from the South American country Guyana, and he has English and Portuguese ancestry through his father. Teixeira's mother is of Italian descent.\n\nTeixeira was originally chosen in the ninth round of the 1998 MLB draft by the Boston Red Sox. Teixeira chose not to sign with the Red Sox, however, opting instead to play college baseball for Georgia Tech citing that he didn't appreciate how the Red Sox treated him. In the summer of 1999, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he won the league's Outstanding Pro Prospect Award.\n\nTeixeira played college baseball at Georgia Tech. In 2000, his batting average was .427, and his on-base plus slugging (OPS) was 1.319. He also won the Dick Howser Trophy as the national collegiate baseball player of the year.\n\nIn 2001, Teixeira re-entered the draft and was selected by the Texas Rangers with the fifth overall pick. The Philadelphia Phillies considered selecting him with the fourth overall pick, but the demands of Teixeira's agent Scott Boras swayed the Phillies to select Gavin Floyd. The Rangers signed Teixeira to a Major League contract worth $9.5 million over 4 years.\n\nTeixeira began the 2002 season in the Florida State League, where he batted .320 with an OPS of 1.000 in 38 games. He was then moved up to the Double-A Tulsa Drillers, with whom he batted .316 with a .994 OPS and hit 10 home runs in 48 games. It turned out that 2002 would be his only season in the minor leagues; he made the Rangers out of spring training in 2003.\n\nAs a rookie in 2003, Teixeira hit .259 with 26 home runs, 84 RBI, and a .811 OPS. Teixeira began to improve in 2004, batting .281 with an OPS of .930, 38 home runs, and 112 RBI. On August 17, 2004, Teixeira hit for the cycle. For his accomplishments in 2005, he earned the Silver Slugger Award as the best-hitting first baseman in the American League as well as the Gold Glove signifying his place as the best fielding first baseman in the American League. He was also named to his first All-Star Game after winning the fan voting portion of the selection to be named the starting first baseman for his league. During the game, Teixeira hit a home run from the right hand side of the plate, something he had failed to do in the entire first half of the season. In a five-game span around the All-Star Game, Teixeira hit five home runs with 13 RBI. He finished July with 13 home runs and 30 RBI and was named the American League Player of the Month. Overall, Teixeira batted .301 with 43 home runs and 144 RBI in the 2005 season.\n\nIn 2005, Teixeira became the third switch-hitter in MLB history to hit at least 20 home runs in each of his first three seasons, after Eddie Murray and Chipper Jones. He is also one of just five players in Major League history to hit at least 100 home runs in his first three seasons, joining Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio, Ralph Kiner, and Eddie Mathews as well as current first base star, Albert Pujols. Other players – Mark McGwire, José Canseco, Todd Helton, Ryan Howard – have hit 100+ home runs in their first three full seasons, but these players had all played partial seasons prior to playing their first three full seasons. His 2005 total of 144 RBI is a Major League record for a switch-hitter.\n\nOn Mother's Day, May 14, 2006, Teixeira was one of more than 50 hitters who brandished a pink bat to benefit the Breast Cancer Foundation.\n\nTeixeira's 2006 season began slowly, as he collected only nine home runs before the All-Star Break. After the All-Star Break, however, he was among the league's leaders in home runs, and again finished with over 30 homers and 100 RBI for the season.\n\nTeixeira agreed to a two-year $15.98 million contract before the 2006 season to avoid his first two years of arbitration.\n\nOn June 9, 2007, Teixeira's franchise record 507 consecutive-game streak came to an end. Teixeira landed awkwardly at first base after running out a grounder in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers the previous day. The streak was second to Miguel Tejada at the time. The strained quadriceps muscle placed Teixeira on the disabled list for only the second time of his career.\n\nOn July 31, 2007, two weeks after turning down an eight-year, $140 million contract extension from the Rangers, Teixeira was traded to the Atlanta Braves (along with left-handed reliever Ron Mahay) for catcher/first baseman Jarrod Saltalamacchia, and four prospects: shortstop Elvis Andrus, and starting pitchers Matt Harrison, Neftalí Feliz and Beau Jones. Teixeira was activated for that night's game against the Houston Astros and arrived in the dugout during the seventh inning. He was promptly shown on Turner Field's high definition video board and received a boisterous applause from the Atlanta crowd.\n\nIn his Braves debut on August 1, 2007, Teixeira hit a 3-run homer and drove in 4 runs in a 12–3 rout of the Houston Astros. Teixeira went on to homer in each of the following two games, becoming just the second player to homer in his first three games as a Brave – the first being Gary Sheffield in 2002.\n\nOn August 19, 2007, Teixeira had his first multi-HR game against the Arizona Diamondbacks off Yusmeiro Petit. He would repeat that feat the next day, going deep for two three-run home runs versus the Cincinnati Reds. Teixeira, a switch-hitter, hit both homers on the 19th batting from the left side of the plate, and hit his homers on the 20th from the right side. He was named co-NL Player of the Week from August 20–26 by slugging .793 with three home runs and as expected, he was awarded NL Player of the Month for August. On September 22, Teixeira had his first walk-off hit with the Braves when he singled in Willie Harris giving the Braves a 4–3 extra-inning victory.\n\nIn 54 games with Atlanta in 2007, Teixeira batted .317 with 17 home runs and 56 RBI. The Braves avoided arbitration in the 2007 offseason and signed Teixeira to a one-year, $12.5 million contract for the 2008 season.\n\nOn July 29, 2008, Teixeira was traded to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for Casey Kotchman and minor league pitcher Stephen Marek. Batting third in the Angel order, Teixeira hit .358 with 13 home runs and 43 RBIs after the trade to help his new team to their first 100-win season in franchise history. Through 2011, he was one of seven major leaguers to have had at least four 30-homer, 100-RBI seasons in their first five years, along with Chuck Klein, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Ralph Kiner, Albert Pujols, and Ryan Braun.\n\nTeixeira made his postseason debut with a .467 batting average, 7 hits and an RBI. His new team of the Angels would lose the 2008 ALDS to the Boston Red Sox in 4 games. Teixeira declared for free agency at the end of the season.\n\nIn December 2008, Teixeira agreed preliminarily to a deal with the New York Yankees worth $180 million over 8 years, and he was formally introduced as a Yankee on January 6, 2009. The contract included a full no-trade clause, plus a $5 million signing bonus. He signed with the Yankees over a number of other clubs, including the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Boston Red Sox, Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles. The signing with the Yankees reunited Teixeira with teammate Alex Rodriguez who played for the Texas Rangers from 2001 to 2003. Teixeira wore the number 25 instead of his preferred number 23, since 23 is retired in honor of Don Mattingly. Mattingly was Teixeira's childhood idol, and was the reason Teixeira wore 23 earlier in his career. The signing became official on January 6, 2009.\n\nIn the 2009 season, he led the AL in both home runs (tied with Carlos Peña of Tampa Bay) with 39, and RBI with 122.\n\nTeixeira received a World Series ring as the Yankees won the 2009 World Series, but struggled offensively throughout the postseason, batting only .180 overall and .136 in the World Series. However, several of his hits proved very important, including a walk-off home run in Game 2 of the ALDS and a game-tying home run in Game 2 of the World Series. Additionally, he made several stellar defensive plays in all rounds of the playoffs.\n\nFor the 2009 season, Teixeira was awarded both the Gold Glove and Silver Slugger awards for the American League first baseman. He also finished second in the AL MVP balloting behind Twins' catcher Joe Mauer.\n\nOn April 23, against the Angels, Teixeira was involved in a home-plate collision with Bobby Wilson while sliding home. Teixeira confessed that the collision was not intentional, and was not disciplined by the league for his action. On May 8, Teixeira became the second Yankees player to hit three home runs in one game against the Boston Red Sox, joining Lou Gehrig, who accomplished the feat on June 23, 1927. On June 20, against the New York Mets, Teixeira hit a grand slam off Johan Santana, proving to be the Yankees' only offense of the game in the 4–0 victory. Once again, Teixeira won the 2010 Gold Glove Award for American League first basemen. In 158 games of 2010, Teixeira finished with a .256 average, 33 home runs, and 108 runs. In the 2010 ALCS, Teixeira injured his hamstring, and did not play for the remainder of the playoffs. The Yankees lost the series to the Rangers in 6 games.\n\nOn June 30, 2011, Teixeira hit his 300th career home run off Randy Wolf of the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nOn August 2, 2011, Teixeira hit a home run from both sides of the plate in the same game for the 12th time in his career, breaking a three-way tie with Chili Davis and Eddie Murray for the most such games all-time.\n\nIn August 2011, Teixeira and Curtis Granderson became the first Yankees teammates to have 30 home runs in 115 games since Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle in 1961.\n\nThrough 2011, he had the third-best career fielding percentage among major league first basemen (.996), behind Casey Kotchman and Kevin Youkilis. During the 2011 year, Teixeira batted .248 with 39 home runs and 111 RBI in 156 games. Teixeira continued his postseason struggles in 2011 as he batted only .167 with 1 RBI in a 5-game ALDS loss to the Detroit Tigers.\n\nOn March 1, 2012, Teixeira hired Casey Close of Excel Sports Management to be his agent. This came almost a year after Teixeira parted ways with Boras. Close also represents fellow Yankees Derek Jeter and Masahiro Tanaka, as well as Ryan Howard.\n\nThroughout the 2012 season, Teixeira was plagued with several health issues and injuries such as a \"persistent and almost debilitating\" cough caused by severe congestion of the bronchi, wrist inflammation, and a calf strain. Teixeira spent some time on the disabled list with the calf strain from late August until early September. After committing a disputed double play in a 4-5 loss against the Orioles, Teixeira aggravated his calf and was put on the DL again. He would eventually return for the season finale against the Red Sox. He finished the 2012 season with a .251 batting average, 24 home runs, and 84 RBI in 123 games played. The Yankees would again make the playoffs, but loss to the Tigers in a 4-game sweep of the 2012 ALCS. Following the season, Teixeira won the 2012 Gold Glove Award for American League first basemen. He won a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding first baseman in MLB. He named the Yankees' nominee for the 2012 Roberto Clemente Award.\n\nOn March 6, 2013, Teixeira suffered a strained wrist tendon while he was part of Team USA of the World Baseball Classic. Teixeira began the 2013 season on the 15-day disabled list, and was transferred to the 60-day disabled list on May 14. He returned on May 31, 2013, against the Red Sox going 0−3 with a walk and scoring a run. He aggravated the wrist on June 15, 2013, and the next day, he received cortisone injections to treat the inflammation of the wrist. He was again placed on the 15-day DL due to the inflammation on June 18, 2013. Teixeira played in only 15 games during the 2013 season with a .151 average, 3 home runs, and 12 RBI. On July 1, 2013, Teixeira underwent wrist surgery and was shut down for the rest of the season.\n\nDuring a game against the Toronto Blue Jays on April 4, 2014, Teixeira left the game after a hamstring injury while trying to fetch a foul ball in foul territory. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list the following day on April 5, 2014. He was activated on April 20, 2014. During a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 17, 2014, Teixeira hit his 350th career home run off of Edinson Vólquez. On May 31, 2014, Teixeira aggravated his wrist that was surgically repaired the previous year. He received a cortisone shot to treat the wrist and missed two games. During a game against the Orioles on June 22, 2014, Teixeira left the game after being hit in the toe of the left foot by a pitch from T. J. McFarland. X-rays came back negative on the toe injury. On September 4, 2014, Teixeira hit his 21st home run of the season, which was a game-tying, solo home run that paved the way for a walk-off 5-4 victory over the Red Sox. In 2014, Teixeira batted only .216, but still hit 22 home runs with 62 RBI limited to 123 games.\n\nTeixeira experienced a resurgent season in 2015, being named to his third All-Star team, hitting the most home runs in a season since 2011. During a game against the Minnesota Twins on August 17, 2015, Teixeira fouled a ball off his leg and left the game. X-Rays were negative, but it was projected that he had a deep bone bruise in his leg. Listed as day-to-day, Teixeira missed nearly two weeks and was sent back to New York on August 31, 2015 to visit Yankees head team physician, Dr. Christopher Ahmad to seek second opinions. On September 1, Teixeira underwent CAT scans, x-rays, and MRIs, all testing negative. On September 4, Teixeira was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to the nagging bone bruise. On September 11, Teixeira underwent further tests and an MRI revealed a fracture in his shin, which eventually ended his 2015 season. The injury required three months to recover. In 111 games of 2015, Teixeira batted .255 with 31 home runs and 79 RBI.\n\nTeixeira struggled to open the season. On May 10, 2016, Teixeira revealed that he had been battling neck spasms. On May 25, he underwent an MRI on his neck, which was negative. The next day, he received a cortisone shot to treat the pain in his neck. In a game against the Orioles on June 3, he left the game due to right knee discomfort. He underwent an MRI the next day, which revealed that there was torn articular cartilage, placing him on the 15-day disabled list. Hoping to avoid surgery, Teixeira opted for treatment and rehabilitation on June 8. He was activated on June 25.\n\nWhile playing the San Diego Padres on July 3, Teixeira hit two home runs, including his 400th career home run. He became only the fifth switch-hitter to hit 400 home runs in a career. He followed teammate and fellow switch-hitter Carlos Beltrán, who had also hit his 400th career home run for the Yankees less than two months earlier on May 15. Another former teammate who also accomplished this feat was Chipper Jones, with whom Teixeira briefly played as a member of the Atlanta Braves.\n\nOn August 5, Teixeira held a press conference in which he announced his intent to retire at the end of the season, citing his family life and the year's injuries.\n\nOn September 28, Teixeira hit the final home run of his career, which was a walk-off grand slam off Boston Red Sox pitcher Joe Kelly. It was the first game-ending home run Teixeira had ever hit in a regular-season game. As of July 2019, it is also the only walk-off grand slam hit at the new Yankee Stadium.\n\nOn September 30, prior to a game against the Orioles, Teixeira was honored by the rock band, Twisted Sister during a pregame ceremony. The band gifted Teixeira an Epiphone Les Paul guitar with signatures from everyone in the band. The song, \"I Wanna Rock\" was used as Teixeira's walk-up song since he first joined the Yankees. October 2 was Teixeira's final game of his career. Prior to the game, another pregame ceremony took place with his wife and three children visiting. He received several gifts, including a framed jersey and an autographed base. He finished the game 0 for 3 and left the game in the 7th inning as the Yankees lost 5-2 to the Orioles. In 116 games of his final season in the majors, Teixeira batted .204 with 15 home runs and 44 RBI.\n\n\nTeixeira supported Marco Rubio in his campaign for President in 2016.\n\nIn August 2011, Teixeira made a cameo appearance during the eighth and final season of the HBO TV series \"Entourage\" along with teammate Alex Rodriguez. Eduardo Núñez is also seen in the cameo. Teixeira made his Broadway debut in a one-night cameo in the jukebox musical \"Rock of Ages\" on January 29, 2013. He played the role of Mark, a bartender at the fictional Bourbon Room.\n\nA self-described avid film buff, Teixeira is a member of the board of the Greenwich International Film Festival.\n\nDuring 2014 spring training, Teixeira filmed in \"Foul Territory\", a parody interview show aired by the YES Network. He came up with the idea as a way to help the Yankees' new free agent signings to the team. The show has been described as similar in style to \"The Chris Farley Show\" and \"Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis\". It was announced as a New York Emmy Award nominee on February 11, 2015.\n\nOn February 6, 2017, Teixeira joined ESPN as a baseball analyst.\n\nTeixeira is a board member of a few organizations, such as DREAM (formerly Harlem RBI), the Greenwich International Film Festival, and the Emerald Corridor Foundation.\n\nAfter signing his first major league contract, Teixeira set up a scholarship at his high school in honor of a friend who was killed in a car accident.\n\nTeixeira and his family reside in Greenwich, Connecticut. In 2006, Teixeira and his wife Leigh Williams, whom he met at Georgia Tech, established the Mark Teixeira Charitable Fund that supported six scholarships at three high schools in the Dallas–Fort Worth area. They have three children, sons Jack Gordan and William Charles, and daughter Addison Leigh.\n\nTeixeira's mother Margaret died on December 2, 2015. Texeira's father John remarried Sherry McCann, the mother of Texeira's former Brave and Yankee teammate Brian McCann.\n\nHis hobbies include hunting, golfing, reading, and fishing. He also enjoys Broadway theatre and identifies \"Les Misérables\" as his favorite production.\n\nTeixeira is a devout Catholic and credits much his success to his father's guidance and to the insight that the death of a friend in high school provided. There is also a video on YouTube in which he discusses his faith.\n\n"}

The current version (4.3.2) contains more than 300,000 Chinese-English entries and over 60,000 English-Chinese entries.. It allows users to search for Chinese characters or words by inputting either Chinese characters or pinyin using a variety of input options, including handwriting recognition. Users can update existing entries add new definitions to the dictionary. The program can also be extended with additional data modules, such as the ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese.\n\nUnlike most electronic Chinese dictionaries, characters in Wenlin are defined in terms of the Character Description Language (CDL), an XML specification for describing complex glyphs in East Asian language, developed by the Wenlin Institute. This allows the program to define characters and character variants that are not defined in existing character sets such as Unicode. Version 4.3.2 of Wenlin covers more than 80,000 Chinese characters, including many rare characters.\n\nThe software allows the user to display lists of Chinese characters ordered by pinyin, stroke count, frequency, components, or Unicode. It also displays lists of words by pinyin, frequency, and serial number. English words can be displayed alphabetically, as well as the 214 radicals of the Chinese language.\n\nThe paid version of the software comes with a small corpus of largely Classical Chinese texts. The software also allows users to open text files in a variety of Chinese character encodings.\n\nWenlin Software for Learning Chinese is developed and sold by the Wenlin Institute, a Social Purpose Corporation for Chinese and English language education, with Tom Bishop as President.

He was also a comedian and television producer.\n\nCordero (birth name: Francisco Cordero Baez) was born to Francisco Cordero Paco and Berta Baez de Cordero in Santurce, Puerto Rico. Cordero attended Santurce Central High School upon finishing his primary and secondary education. He was a member of his high school's drama club and participated in its plays, where he discovered the art of comedy. Cordero was geatly influenced by his aunt on his father's side, Mapy Cortés. Mapy Cortés had moved to Mexico from Puerto Rico, where she became an actress. She married the Puerto Rican-born Mexican actor Fernando Cortés, a childhood friend. After Cordero graduated from high school, he enrolled and attended the University of Puerto Rico and married his childhood sweetheart, a hairdresser whom everyone knew as \"Cuqui\". With Cuqui he had three children, two girls and one boy.\n\nCordero auditioned for a role in a comedy skit which was transmitted through Radio El Mundo and was subsequently hired. He did this in his spare time. His aunt Mapy and her husband Fernando returned to the island and presented an idea for a comedy show to Ángel Ramos, owner of El Mundo Enterprises. On March 28, 1954, Puerto Rico received its first television transmission from Angel Ramos' WKAQ-TV Telemundo Channel 2. Among the first comedy shows to go on the air was \"Mapy Y Papi\" with Mapy and Fernando Cortés, María Judith Franco and Paquito Cordero.\n\nDuring this period in his life, he fell in love with one of the show's dancers, a young girl by the name of Nora. He soon divorced his first wife and asked Nora to marry him. She accepted and together they had a son, Santiago.\n\nIn the 1960s, Cordero formed his own production company which he named Paquito Cordero Productions, Inc. His younger sister, Bertita, became his assistant and eventually his younger brother, Jorge, would also join the company as a future co-producer. On January 11, 1965, Telemundo transmitted the first program produced by Paquito called \"El Show de las 12\" (The 12 O'Clock Show). The first show included appearances by El Gran Combo, Tito Lara, Los Hispanos, and Olga y Tony. It also included a section within the show, dedicated to the teenage crowd, called \"Canta la Juventud\" (Youth Sings). Among those taking part in this section were Alfred D. Herger and Puerto Rican teen idols Lucecita Benítez and Chucho Avellanet. \"El Show de Las 12\" was presented by Miguel Ángel Álvarez and Eddie Miró was the scriptwriter. The show was a success and was watched by over 80 percent of the population, becoming one of Puerto Rico's most beloved programs for over 40 years.\n\nCordero also produced the following shows which were popular in Puerto Rico:\n\nOn April 14, 1983, Telemundo was sold to John Blair and Co. and finally, in 2004 became part of the NBC Universal network. This led to many changes and one of the changes was the substitution of locally produced programs with programs produced in other countries such as Mexico. Cordero, however, remained at Telemundo as its main local producer from 1983 to 2004.\n\nOn May 6, 2004, television producers Paquito Cordero and Tommy Muñiz received a special recognition on behalf of the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico as part of the celebration of the 50 years of uninterrupted transmission on the Telemundo and Televicentro channels.\n\nOn February 25, 2005, Telemundo canceled Paquito Cordero's \"El Show de las 12\", the longest-running television show in Puerto Rico. Telemundo no longer transmits locally produced television programs and thus, is no longer a source of income to the local artistic class.\n\nOn the last airing of the show, Eddie Miró took the microphone and said these words:\n\nIn 2007, Cordero, produced a remake of \"Noche de Gala\", (Gala Night Ball), broadcast by WIPR-TV, Tu Universo Television, channel 6, with Deborah Carthy Deu, as the host. Cordero died of respiratory problems in the morning hours of June 30, 2009. He is survived by his wife, Nora, and four children, Paquitin, Chiqui, Muñeca and Santiago. The governor of Puerto Rico, Luis Fortuño, declared three days of national mourning. On July 2, a wake was held in the \"Salon de Actos\" of El Convento Dominicos in Old San Juan which was assisted by the governor and his wife, local celebrities, and Cordero's family and close friends. Cordero remains were later transferred to the Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery also in Old San Juan where he was buried.\n\n"}

Although the French and the Ferrarese drove the Papal-Spanish army from the field, their general Gaston of Foix died in battle and the victory failed to help them secure northern Italy. The French would be forced to withdraw entirely from Italy in the summer of 1512, as Swiss mercenaries hired by Pope Julius II and Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor arrived in Lombardy and restored the Sforza to power in Milan.\n\nA month before the battle, multiple sources reported a monstrous birth which became known as the Monster of Ravenna. This child's terrifying features included a horn on its forehead, wings, an eye on its knee, and a clawed foot, according to Florentine chronicler Luca Landucci. Its appearance was evidently a cause for alarm, and news spread across Europe in the diaries of contemporary writers.\n\nMost accounts, including that of Landucci's, associate the \"monster's\" appearance with the battle it preceded; its appearance was taken for a bad omen of future suffering, and the French medical professional Ambroise Paré opined that the creature's birth was a direct sign of God's wrath, brought to bear in the form of Louis XII's army. Regardless, the Monster of Ravenna acquired theological implications which evolved beyond the one battle and persisted well into the Protestant Reformation.\n\nBeginning in February 1512, the French forces in Italy, newly commanded by Gaston de Foix, Duc de Nemours, had been engaged in capturing cities in the Romagna and the Veneto, in an attempt to deny control of those regions to the forces of the Holy League. Although he had been successful in a number of sieges, Nemours was aware that the impending invasion of France by Henry VIII of England would cause much of his army to be withdrawn, and he was determined to force the main army of the Holy League into battle before that occurred. Thus, in late March, Nemours, together with an Italian contingent under Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, marched east from Bologna and laid siege to the city of Ravenna, which was defended by Papal troops.\n\nJulius II, alarmed at the prospect of losing his last stronghold in the Romagna, demanded that an army be sent to relieve the city; Ramón de Cardona had to comply, and the Spanish army set out for Ravenna with a company of Papal troops in tow. By 9 April, they had passed Forlì, and were advancing north along the Ronco River towards the city, and on the next day had reached Molinaccio, only a mile south of the French positions, but still separated from them by the Ronco. Nemours, short on supplies and increasingly anxious to give battle before he was forced to withdraw from Italy, ordered a general attack for the following day.\n\nThe strengths, relative positions, and commanders of the component elements of both armies are unclear, and different arrangements are given by historians. The French army formed up in an arc to the east of Cardona's fortified camp; closest to the river were about 900 men-at-arms of the \"vaward\", under Jacques de La Palice and Alfonso d'Este. Next to this cavalry was the bulk of the infantry. According to Charles Oman, it consisted of three separate units: 3,500 Gascon crossbowmen, 5,000 landsknechts under Jacob Empser, and 3,000 Picards and Gascons under Thomas Bohier, the Seneschal of Normandy. Frederick Taylor groups the infantry into only two units: 9,500 landsknechts under Empser and 8,000 \"Gascon archers and Picard pikemen\" under the Seigneur de Molart. The men-at-arms of the \"main-battle\", consisting of 780 men, was commanded by either Bohier alone, or by Bohier together with the Vicomte de Lautrec, Louis d'Ars, and the Chevalier de Bayard. This cavalry occupied one of two positions: according to Oman and Thomas Arnold, it was placed in the arc to the left of the French infantry, while Taylor has it behind the cavalry of the \"vaward\", next to the river. Farther to the left of the French line—beyond the cavalry of the \"main-battle\", according to Arnold and Oman, or directly flanking the infantry, according to Taylor—was the \"rearward\" corps of the army, commanded by Yves d'Alégre. It consisted of about 4,000 mostly Italian infantry under Frederigo de Bozzolo, flanked, on the extreme left, by about 2,000 light cavalry under Gian Bernardo Caracciolo.\nThe arrangement of the Holy League army is similarly a matter of dispute; Oman comments that \"the array of Cardona's army, though elaborately described by more than one narrator, is not very easy to make out.\" At the north end of the camp, near the river, was the cavalry of the \"vaward\", consisting of about 670 Papal men-at-arms under Fabrizio Colonna. Farther along the river were two more bodies of men-at-arms: the \"main-battle\", consisting of 565 men under the Marquis of La Palude, and the rearguard, consisting of 490 men under Alfonso Carvajal. Taylor divides the Holy League infantry into four blocks: three divisions of Spanish infantry, each consisting of four \"colunellas\" of 500–600 men each, and one formation of Papal infantry, numbering about 2,000, all under the general command of Pedro Navarro; Taylor places the formations of infantry in a deep column parallel to the river, on the far side of the cavalry, and perpendicular to the entrenchments. Oman and Arnold place the infantry in three lines running along the length of the entrenchements; no number is given for the first of these, but the second is given as consisting of 4,000 men, and the third, placed as a reserve, as including \"three Spanish foot regiments\" as well as the 2,000 Papal infantry. Beyond the infantry—to the far side of it from the river, according to Taylor, or at the end of its line, according to Oman and Arnold—was the light cavalry, consisting of 1,500–1,700 Spanish \"ginetes\" and Italian mounted arquebusiers under the command of Fernando d'Avalos, Marquis of Pescara. In his section on war wagons Arnold avers that the Spanish \"had at least thirty carts mounting scythe blades, forward-projecting spears and organ guns.\n\nThe advancing French troops halted about two hundred paces from the enemy lines. The sporadic exchange of artillery fire that had been taking place since the French had begun to cross the Ronco now developed into a full-scale artillery duel between the two armies that lasted more than two hours. A new tactic, the open-field exchange of artillery fire was \"the most violent cannonade between armies in the field that the world had yet seen\", according to Taylor, and \"the first of its kind in the historical record\", according to Bert Hall.\n\nDe Foix placed the bulk of his artillery in front of the French right wing, directing its fire into the Holy League's camp. Navarro ordered his infantry to take cover—the troops hid in the trenches, or lay prone on the slopes of the river embankments—but Colonna's men-at-arms had no shelter available, and began to take heavy casualties from the cannon fire. The Spanish artillery, meanwhile, ignored the French cavalry and concentrated its fire on the massed Gascons and landsknechts in the French center. The Spanish fire was, according to Oman, \"excessively murderous\", and casualties among the French infantry were substantial; as many as 2,000 men were killed, and the Gascons were so shaken by the fire that the landsknechts were forced to push them back with pikes in order to keep them in line.\n\nNot content with bombarding the camp from one side, the French moved to enfilade it from the flanks. The Duke of Ferarra, who had apparently been acting independently of the main army since the crossing of the Ronco, had moved twenty-four of his cannon around the rear of the French position, finally bringing them up on the left flank, facing Pescara's light cavalry. From this position, d'Este's guns inflicted heavy casualties on Pescara and Carvajal's cavalry; so intense was the fire that some of it overshot the camp, inflicting casualties on the French troops on the other side. Yves d'Alègre, meanwhile, had devised a similar plan on the other flank; re-crossing the Ronco with two heavy guns, he positioned them across the river from the Spanish camp—directly to the rear of Colonna's position. The fire of these two guns inflicted massive casualties on Colonna's closely packed cavalry.\n\nPressed from both sides by the fire of the French and Ferrarese artillery, the Holy League's cavalry could not hold their positions indefinitely. The first to move were the heavy cavalry of the rearguard under Carvajal, riding out from the entrenchments towards the Ferrarese guns on the French left; according to Taylor, Carvajal's advance was disorderly and possibly spontaneous. Carvajal was quickly joined by Pescara's light cavalry and by the Marquis of La Palude, both having been sent forward by Cardona; together, these bodies of cavalry advanced on the French line, Palude moving directly forwards while Pescara attempted a flanking movement. The target of the cavalry attack is inconsistently named among contemporary sources; both Oman and Taylor agree that it must have been the heavy cavalry of the French \"main-battle\", commanded by Foix, Lautrec, and the Seneschal of Normandy, which had apparently moved towards the French left.\n\nCarvajal, Pescara, and Palude converged on the French cavalry, which split into two bodies and met both Spanish attacks head-on. The initial Spanish charges were unsuccessful in breaking the French line; Taylor attributes their failure to the depleted morale of the Spanish cavalry after the artillery bombardment, the effect of \"ditches and vegetation\" on the Spanish formations, the better tactics of the French, and the arrival of reinforcements sent by La Palice from the French vanguard. The bodies of French and Spanish cavalry then engaged in a lengthy fight along the left of the French positions.\n\nMeanwhile, Fabrizio Colonna, having seen the other Spanish cavalry engaged, rode out between the Ronco and the Spanish trenches and charged the French line; his target is similarly the subject of disagreement among contemporary sources, but Oman and Taylor agree that he must have attacked the portion of the French vanguard under La Palice which the latter had not sent to assist Foix in the center. As Colonna and La Palice fought along the French right, d'Alègre, who had earlier been summoned by La Palice, arrived with 400 fresh heavy cavalry, as well as the infantry of the French reserve. Colonna's formation, pressed from multiple directions, began to disintegrate, with some of his men-at-arms fleeing the field and others retreating south to where the other Spanish cavalry was engaged.\n\nD'Alègre followed the retreating Spanish troops to the center, where the remnants of the Spanish cavalry were engaged in a desperate melee against the French. Finally, when a part of the French vanguard joined the fight as well, the Spanish cavalry broke; Pescara and La Palude were taken prisoner, Colonna retreated back into the Spanish entrenchments, and Carvajal and Cardona fled south-west towards Cesena. A large part of the French cavalry pursued the retreating Spanish, while the others turned to take part in the infantry fight which had unfolded in the meantime.\n\nAs the Spanish cavalry was making its initial attack, Foix had sent orders for the French infantry to advance on the Holy League's camp. A mixed group of 2,000 Gascon crossbowmen and 1,000 Picard pikemen, gathered from Molart's and Bozollo's troops, advanced towards the camp; according to Taylor, they moved along a path between the embankment and the river, and were shielded from view by the former. The Gascons advanced to the edge of the Spanish entrenchments and began to fire onto the Spanish infantry; according to Oman, they were immediately driven back by \"a blistering fire of arquebuses and swivel guns\", while Taylor writes that Navarro moved the Papal infantry forward to engage them.\n\nThe main column of landsknechts had meanwhile made its way to the edge of the Spanish entrenchments, and begun to force its way into the fortified camp. Jacob Empser and his lieutenant Fabian von Schlabendorf were both killed in the initial push, but parts of the German column finally crossed the ditch and engaged the waiting Spanish infantry hand-to-hand. The Spanish swordsmen inflicted massive casualties among the landsknechts—who were unable to defend themselves with long pikes at such close quarters—and the German column recoiled back across the trenches, having suffered more than a thousand casualties.\n\nThe landsknechts and the Gascons proceeded to attack once more, with even greater casualties. Fabrizio Colonna, who had by this time returned to the camp with the remnants of his cavalry, charged into the flank of the attacking infantry; he would write that \"with 200 lances he could have retrieved the fortune of the day\". Two companies of Spanish infantry attacked the Gascons engaged on the riverbank, breaking their formation, killing Molart, and pursuing them back towards the French artillery positions. The remaining infantry on both sides continued meanwhile to struggle across the entrenchments.\n\nAt this juncture, the French cavalry—both those that had returned from the pursuit of Cardona and those that had remained on the field—descended on the Spanish infantry from all sides. Together with the German and Gascon infantry, which had reformed and now renewed its attacks, the French cavalry overwhelmed the Spanish formations, inflicting terrible casualties; Colonna and Navarro were both wounded and captured as they tried to rally the defenders. A few thousand of the Spanish infantry managed to escape, fleeing towards Cesena and Forlì; the others were \"ridden over and trampled down\", according to Oman.\n\nThe two Spanish companies which had earlier routed the Gascons, having found their path north barred by the French rearguard under the Bastard du Fay, had meanwhile retraced their path along the river back towards the camp. Marching south along the embankment, they were attacked by Gaston de Foix and his personal staff, numbering about fifteen; in the ensuing melee, the French knights were scattered, Foix was killed, and the Spanish proceeded to withdraw from the field. A few miles from the battlefield, the Spanish infantry encountered Bayard, returning from his pursuit of Cardona; lacking the numbers to break them, Bayard let them pass, not knowing that they had just killed his commander.\n\nThe death of Gaston de Foix was a huge blow to the French, and his men were very sad to hear of his death. The young, talented general had a very high command level and had masterminded a remarkable string of victories in Italy. He was inspiring and faithful to his men. The Italian Wars might have taken a very different course had he survived the battle.\n\nFollowing the death of Gaston de Foix, command of the French army fell to La Palice, who had little interest in pursuing the retreating Spanish forces, preferring instead to return to the siege of Ravenna. The city soon fell, and the French proceeded to thoroughly sack it. However, much of the French army was withdrawn to France following the battle, and La Palice was forced to extricate himself from Italy in August by renewed efforts on the part of the Holy League.\n\nThe Spanish forces in Italy were almost entirely destroyed at Ravenna, but Cardona would raise another army and appear in Lombardy in 1513. In the meantime, both Navarro and Colonna would see combat, Colonna in command of an Italian army and Navarro in the service of Francis I of France.\n\n"}

Sampled sounds include guitar feedback, vocals, a BBC stock sound effects recording to create a low-end effect on \"To Here Knows When\", and a Turkish belly dancing track ripped from cassette on the track “Swallow.” The title is a reference to the band's heavy usage of guitar tremolo and vibrato to create blurred, dreamlike tones (Kevin Shields' method of strumming chords while simultaneously bending his guitar's tremolo/whammy bar was referred to as \"glide guitar\").\n\nIn November 1991, Shields commented: \"\"Tremolo\" had seven tracks on it, but you're not allowed to do that, so we called it four tracks and didn't name three of them. People just thought they were weird bits!\" The lead track, \"To Here Knows When\", has a longer and more ethereal coda—essentially constituting a separate song—than the version later included on the album \"Loveless\". \"Swallow\" and \"Honey Power\" also each contain an instrumental coda.

{"id": "2071443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071443", "title": "Framing (construction)", "text": "Framing (construction)\n\nFraming, in construction, is the fitting together of pieces to give a structure support and shape. Framing materials are usually wood, engineered wood, or structural steel. The alternative to framed construction is generally called \"mass wall\" construction, where horizontal layers of stacked materials such as log building, masonry, rammed earth, adobe, etc. are used without framing.\n\nBuilding framing is divided into two broad categories, heavy-frame construction (heavy framing) if the vertical supports are few and heavy such as in timber framing, pole building framing, or steel framing; or light-frame construction (light-framing) if the supports are more numerous and smaller, such as balloon, platform, or light-steel framing. Light-frame construction using standardized dimensional lumber has become the dominant construction method in North America and Australia due to the economy of the method; use of minimal structural material allows builders to enclose a large area at minimal cost while achieving a wide variety of architectural styles.\n\nModern light-frame structures usually gain strength from rigid panels (plywood and other plywood-like composites such as oriented strand board (OSB) used to form all or part of wall sections), but until recently carpenters employed various forms of diagonal bracing to stabilize walls. Diagonal bracing remains a vital interior part of many roof systems, and in-wall wind braces are required by building codes in many municipalities or by individual state laws in the United States. Special framed shear walls are becoming more common to help buildings meet the requirements of earthquake engineering and wind engineering.\n\nHistorically, people fitted naturally shaped wooden poles together as framework and then began using joints to connect the timbers, a method today called \"traditional timber framing or log framing. In the United States, timber framing was superseded by balloon framing beginning in the 1830s. Balloon framing makes use of many lightweight wall members called studs rather than fewer, heavier supports called posts; balloon framing components are nailed together rather than fitted using joinery. The studs in a balloon frame extend two stories from sill to plate. Platform framing\"' superseded balloon framing and is the standard wooden framing method today. The name comes from each floor level being framed as a separate unit or platform.\n\nFramed construction was rarely used in Scandinavia before the 20th century because of the abundant availability of wood, an abundance of cheap labour, and the superiority of the thermal insulation of logs; hence timber framing did not take off there first for unheated buildings such as farm buildings, outbuildings and summer villas, and for houses until the development of wall insulation.\n\nWall framing in house construction includes the vertical and horizontal members of exterior walls and interior partitions, both of bearing walls and non-bearing walls. These \"stick members\", referred to as studs, wall plates and lintels (sometimes called \"headers\"), serve as a nailing base for all covering material and support the upper floor platforms, which provide the lateral strength along a wall. The platforms may be the boxed structure of a ceiling and roof, or the ceiling and floor joists of the story above. In the building trades, the technique is variously referred to as \"stick and frame\", \"stick and platform\", or \"stick and box\", as the sticks (studs) give the structure its vertical support, and the box-shaped floor sections with joists contained within length-long post and lintels (more commonly called \"headers\"), support the weight of whatever is above, including the next wall up and the roof above the top story. The platform also provides the lateral support against wind and holds the stick walls true and square. Any lower platform supports the weight of the platforms and walls above the level of its component headers and joists.\n\nFraming lumber is subject to regulated standards that require a grade-stamp, and a moisture content not exceeding 19%.\n\nThere are three historically common methods of framing a house.\n\nWall sheathing, usually a plywood or other laminate, is usually applied to the framing prior to erection, thus eliminating the need to scaffold, and again increasing speed and cutting manpower needs and expenses. Some types of exterior sheathing, such as asphalt-impregnated fiberboard, plywood, oriented strand board and waferboard, will provide adequate bracing to resist lateral loads and keep the wall square. (Construction codes in most jurisdictions require a stiff plywood sheathing.) Others, such as rigid glass-fiber, asphalt-coated fiberboard, polystyrene or polyurethane board, will not. In this latter case, the wall should be reinforced with a diagonal wood or metal bracing inset into the studs. In jurisdictions subject to strong wind storms (hurricane countries, tornado alleys) local codes or state law will generally require both the diagonal wind braces and the stiff exterior sheathing regardless of the type and kind of outer weather resistant coverings.\n\nA multiple-stud post made up of at least three studs, or the equivalent, is generally used at exterior corners and intersections to secure a good tie between adjoining walls, and to provide nailing support for interior finishes and exterior sheathing. Corners and intersections, however, must be framed with at least two studs.\n\nNailing support for the edges of the ceiling is required at the junction of the wall and ceiling where partitions run parallel to the ceiling joists. This material is commonly referred to as \"dead wood\" or backing.\n\nWall framing in house construction includes the vertical and horizontal members of exterior walls and interior partitions. These members, referred to as studs, wall plates and lintels, serve as a nailing base for all covering material and support the upper floors, ceiling and roof.\n\nExterior wall studs are the vertical members to which the wall sheathing and cladding are attached. They are supported on a bottom plate or foundation sill and in turn support the top plate. Studs usually consist of or lumber and are commonly spaced at on center. This spacing may be changed to on center depending on the load and the limitations imposed by the type and thickness of the wall covering used. Wider studs may be used to provide space for more insulation. Insulation beyond that which can be accommodated within a stud space can also be provided by other means, such as rigid or semi-rigid insulation or batts between horizontal furring strips, or rigid or semi-rigid insulation sheathing to the outside of the studs. The studs are attached to horizontal top and bottom wall plates of lumber that are the same width as the studs.\n\nInterior partitions supporting floor, ceiling or roof loads are called loadbearing walls; others are called non-loadbearing or simply partitions. Interior loadbearing walls are framed in the same way as exterior walls. Studs are usually lumber spaced at on center. This spacing may be changed to depending on the loads supported and the type and thickness of the wall finish used.\n\nPartitions can be built with or studs spaced at on center depending on the type and thickness of the wall finish used. Where a partition does not contain a swinging door, studs at on center are sometimes used with the wide face of the stud parallel to the wall. This is usually done only for partitions enclosing clothes closets or cupboards to save space. Since there is no vertical load to be supported by partitions, single studs may be used at door openings. The top of the opening may be bridged with a single piece of lumber the same width as the studs. These members provide a nailing support for wall finish, door frames and trim.\n\nLintels (or, headers) are the horizontal members placed over window, door and other openings to carry loads to the adjoining studs. Lintels are usually constructed of two pieces of 2 in (nominal) (38 mm) lumber separated with spacers to the width of the studs and nailed together to form a single unit. Lintels are predominately nailed together without spacers to form a solid beam and allow the remaining cavity to be filled with insulation from the inside. The preferable spacer material is rigid insulation. The depth of a lintel is determined by the width of the opening and vertical loads supported.\n\nThe complete wall sections are then raised and put in place, temporary braces added and the bottom plates nailed through the subfloor to the floor framing members. The braces should have their larger dimension on the vertical and should permit adjustment of the vertical position of the wall.\n\nOnce the assembled sections are plumbed, they are nailed together at the corners and intersections. A strip of polyethylene is often placed between the interior walls and the exterior wall, and above the first top plate of interior walls before the second top plate is applied to attain continuity of the air barrier when polyethylene is serving this function.\n\nA second top plate, with joints offset at least one stud space away from the joints in the plate beneath, is then added. This second top plate usually laps the first plate at the corners and partition intersections and, when nailed in place, provides an additional tie to the framed walls. Where the second top plate does not lap the plate immediately underneath at corner and partition intersections, these may be tied with galvanized steel plates at least wide and long, nailed with at least three nails to each wall.\n\nBalloon framing is a method of wood construction also known as \"Chicago construction\" in the 19th century used primarily in areas rich in softwood forests: Scandinavia, Canada, the United States up until the mid-1950s, and around Thetford Forest in Norfolk, England. It uses long continuous framing members (studs) that run from the sill plate to the top plate, with intermediate floor structures let into and nailed to them. Here the heights of window sills, headers and next floor height would be marked out on the studs with a story pole. Once popular when long lumber was plentiful, balloon framing has been largely replaced by \"platform framing\".\n\nIt is not certain who introduced balloon framing in the United States. However, the first building using balloon framing was possibly a warehouse constructed in 1832 in Chicago, Illinois, by George Washington Snow. Architectural critic Sigfried Giedion cited Chicago architect John M. Van Osdel's 1880s attribution, as well as A. T. Andreas' 1885 \"History of Chicago,\" to credit Snow as 'inventor of the balloon frame method'. In 1833, Augustine Taylor (1796–1891) constructed St. Mary's Catholic Church in Chicago using the balloon framing method. \n\nIn the 1830s, Hoosier Solon Robinson published articles about a revolutionary new framing system, called \"balloon framing\" by later builders. Robinson's system called for standard 2x4 lumber, nailed together to form a sturdy, light skeleton. Builders were reluctant to adopt the new technology, however, by the 1880s, some form of 2x4 framing was standard.\n\nAlternatively, a precursor to the balloon frame may have been used by the French in Missouri as much as thirty-one years earlier.\n\nThe name comes from a French Missouri type of construction, \"maison en \", \"boulin\" being a French term for a horizontal scaffolding support. Historians have also fabricated the following story: As Taylor was constructing his first such building, St. Mary's Church, in 1833, skilled carpenters looked on at the comparatively thin framing members, all held together with nails, and declared this method of construction to be no more substantial than a balloon. It would surely blow over in the next wind! Though the criticism proved baseless, the name stuck.\n\nAlthough lumber was plentiful in 19th-century America, skilled labor was not. The advent of cheap machine-made nails, along with water-powered sawmills in the early 19th century made balloon framing highly attractive, because it did not require highly skilled carpenters, as did the dovetail joints, mortises and tenons required by post-and-beam construction. For the first time, any farmer could build his own buildings without a time-consuming learning curve.\n\nIt has been said that balloon framing populated the western United States and the western provinces of Canada. Without it, western boomtowns certainly could not have blossomed overnight. It is also likely that, by radically reducing construction costs, balloon framing improved the shelter options of poorer North Americans. For example, many 19th-century New England working neighborhoods consist of balloon-constructed three-story apartment buildings referred to as triple deckers. However, balloon framing did require very long studs and as tall trees were exhausted in the 1920s, platform framing became prevalent.\nThe main difference between platform and balloon framing is at the floor lines. The balloon wall studs extend from the sill of the first story all the way to the top plate or end rafter of the second story. The platform-framed wall, on the other hand, is independent for each floor.\n\nLight-frame materials are most often wood or rectangular steel, tubes or C-channels. Wood pieces are typically connected with nail fasteners, nails, or screws; steel pieces are connected with pan-head framing screws, or nuts and bolts. Preferred species for linear structural members are softwoods such as spruce, pine and fir. Light frame material dimensions range from ; i.e., a Dimensional number two-by-four to 5 cm by 30 cm (two-by-twelve inches) at the cross-section, and lengths ranging from for walls to or more for joists and rafters. Recently, architects have begun experimenting with pre-cut modular aluminum framing to reduce on-site construction costs.\n\nWall panels built of studs are interrupted by sections that provide rough openings for doors and windows. Openings are typically spanned by a header or lintel that bears the weight of structure above the opening. Headers are usually built to rest on trimmers, also called jacks. Areas around windows are defined by a sill beneath the window, and cripples, which are shorter studs that span the area from the bottom plate to the sill and sometimes from the top of the window to a header, or from a header to a top plate. Diagonal bracings made of wood or steel provide shear (horizontal strength) as do panels of sheeting nailed to studs, sills and headers. \n\nWall sections usually include a bottom plate which is secured to the structure of a floor, and one, or more often two top plates that tie walls together and provide a bearing for structures above the wall. Wood or steel floor frames usually include a rim joist around the perimeter of a system of floor joists, and often include bridging material near the center of a span to prevent lateral buckling of the spanning members. In two-story construction, openings are left in the floor system for a stairwell, in which stair risers and treads are most often attached to squared faces cut into sloping stair stringers.\n\nInterior wall coverings in light-frame construction typically include wallboard, lath and plaster or decorative wood paneling.\n\nExterior finishes for walls and ceilings often include plywood or composite sheathing, brick or stone veneers, and various stucco finishes. Cavities between studs, usually placed apart, are usually filled with insulation materials, such as fiberglass batting, or cellulose filling sometimes made of recycled newsprint treated with boron additives for fire prevention and vermin control. \n\nIn natural building, straw bales, cob and adobe may be used for both exterior and interior walls.\n\nThe part of a structural building that goes diagonally across a wall is called a T-bar. It stops the walls from collapsing in gusty winds. \n\nRoofs are usually built to provide a sloping surface intended to shed rain or snow, with slopes ranging from 1:15 (less than an inch per linear foot of horizontal span), to steep slopes of more than 2:1. A light-frame structure built mostly inside sloping walls which also serve as a roof is called an A-frame.\n\nRoofs are most often covered with shingles made of asphalt, fiberglass and small gravel coating, but a wide range of materials are used. Molten tar is often used to waterproof flatter roofs, but newer materials include rubber and synthetic materials. Steel panels are popular roof coverings in some areas, preferred for their durability. Slate or tile roofs offer more historic coverings for light-frame roofs.\n\nLight-frame methods allow easy construction of unique roof designs; hip roofs, for example, slope toward walls on all sides and are joined at hip rafters that span from corners to a ridge. Valleys are formed when two sloping roof sections drain toward each other. Dormers are small areas in which vertical walls interrupt a roof line, and which are topped off by slopes at usually right angles to a main roof section. Gables are formed when a length-wise section of sloping roof ends to form a triangular wall section. Clerestories are formed by an interruption along the slope of a roof where a short vertical wall connects it to another roof section. Flat roofs, which usually include at least a nominal slope to shed water, are often surrounded by parapet walls with openings (called scuppers) to allow water to drain out. Sloping crickets are built into roofs to direct water away from areas of poor drainage, such as behind a chimney at the bottom of a sloping section.\n\nLight-frame buildings in areas with shallow or nonexistent frost depths are often erected on monolithic concrete-slab foundations that serve both as a floor and as a support for the structure. Other light-frame buildings are built over a crawlspace or a basement, with wood or steel joists used to span between foundation walls, usually constructed of poured concrete or concrete blocks.\n\nEngineered components are commonly used to form floor, ceiling and roof structures in place of solid wood. I-joists (closed-web trusses) are often made from laminated woods, most often chipped poplar wood, in panels as thin as , glued between horizontally laminated members of less than 4 cm by 4 cm (\"two-by-twos\"), to span distances of as much as . Open web trussed joists and rafters are often formed of 4 cm by 9 cm (\"two-by-four\") wood members to provide support for floors, roofing systems and ceiling finishes.\n\nPlatform framing was traditionally limited to four floors but some jurisdictions have modified their building codes to allow up to six floors with added fire protection.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2071453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071453", "title": "Blood and soil", "text": "Blood and soil\n\nBlood and soil () is a nationalist slogan expressing Nazi Germany's ideal of a \"racially\" defined national body (\"blood\") united with a settlement area (\"soil\"). By it, rural and farm life forms are not only idealized as a counterweight to urban ones, but they are also associated with an imaginary and sedentary Germanic-Nordic peasantry which is placed in opposition to an anti-Semitic trope of Jewish nomadism. It is tied to the contemporaneous German concept of Lebensraum, the belief that the German people were to expand into Eastern Europe, conquering and displacing the native Slavic and Baltic population via Generalplan Ost.\n\"Blood and soil\" was a key slogan of National Socialist (Nazi) ideology. The nationalist ideology of the Artaman League and the writings of Richard Walther Darré guided agricultural policies which were later adopted by Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler and Baldur von Schirach.\n\nThe German expression was coined in the late 19th century, in tracts espousing racialism/racism and romantic nationalism. It produced a regionalist literature, with some social criticism. This romantic attachment was widespread prior to the rise of the Nazis. Major figures in 19th-century German agrarian romanticism included Ernst Moritz Arndt and Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl, who argued that the peasantry represented the foundation of the German people and conservatism.\n\nUltranationalists predating the Nazis often supported country living as more healthy, with the Artaman League sending urban children to the countryside to work in part in hopes of transforming them into Wehrbauern (lit. \"soldier peasants\").\n\nRichard Walther Darré popularized the phrase at the time of the rise of Nazi Germany; he wrote a book called \"Neuadel aus Blut und Boden\" (\"A New Nobility Based On Blood And Soil\") in 1930, which proposed a systematic eugenics program, arguing for selective breeding as a cure-all for the problems plaguing the state. In 1928, he had also written the book \"Peasantry as the Life Source of the Nordic Race\", in which he presented his theory that the alleged difference between Nordic people and Southeastern Europeans was based in the Nordic people’s connection to superior land. Darré was an influential member of the Nazi Party and a noted race theorist who assisted the party greatly in gaining support among common Germans outside the cities. Prior to their ascension to power, Nazis called for a return from the cities to the countryside. This agrarian sentiment allowed opposition to both the middle class and the aristocracy, and presented the farmer as a superior figure beside the moral swamp of the city (and thus gentile Germans as superior to Jews).\n\nThe doctrine not only called for a \"back to the land\" approach and re-adoption of \"rural values\"; it held that German land was bound, perhaps mystically, to German blood. Peasants were the Nazi cultural heroes, who held charge of German racial stock and German history—as when a memorial of a medieval peasant uprising was the occasion for a speech by Darré praising them as a force and purifier of German history. Agrarianism was asserted as the only way to truly understand the \"natural order.\" Urban culture was decried as a weakness, \"asphalt culture,\" that only the Führer's will could eliminate — sometimes, as a code for Jewish influence. (The fact that Christian governments had banned Jews from owning land for centuries throughout Europe not being mentioned as a crucial historical motivation for Jewish concentration in urban areas.)\n\nIt contributed to the Nazi ideal of a woman: a sturdy, Christian peasant, who worked the land and bore strong children, contributing to praise for athletic women tanned by outdoor work. That country women gave birth to more children than city ones was also a factor in the support.\n\nCarl Schmitt argued that a people would develop laws appropriate to its \"blood and soil\" because authenticity required loyalty to the \"Volk\" over abstract universals.\n\n\"Neues Volk\" displayed anti-Semitic demographic charts to deplore the alleged destruction of Aryan families' farmland and claim that the Jews were eradicating traditional German peasantry. Posters for schools depicted the flight of people from the countryside to the city. The \"German National Catechism\", German propaganda widely used in schools, also spun tales of how farmers supposedly lost ancestral lands and had to move to the city, with all its demoralizing effects:\n\nThe program received far more ideological and propaganda support than concrete changes. When Gottfried Feder tried to settle workers in villages about decentralized factories, generals and Junkers successfully opposed him. Generals objected because it interfered with rearmament, and Junkers because it would prevent their exploiting their estates for the international market. It would also require the breakup of Junker estates for independent farmers, which was not implemented.\n\nThe \"Reichserbhofgesetz\", the State Hereditary Farm Law of 1933, implemented this ideology, stating that its aim was to: \"preserve the farming community as the blood-source of the German people\" (\"Das Bauerntum als Blutquelle des deutschen Volkes erhalten\"). Selected lands were declared hereditary and could not be mortgaged or alienated, and only these farmers were entitled to call themselves \"Bauern\" or \"farmer peasant\", a term the Nazis attempted to refurbish from a neutral or even pejorative to a positive term. Regional custom was only allowed to decide whether the eldest or the youngest son was to be the heir. In areas where no particular custom prevailed, the youngest son was to be the heir. During the Nazi era the eldest son inherited the farm in most cases. Priority was given to the patriline, so that, if there were no sons, the brothers and brothers' sons of the deceased peasant had precedence over the peasant's own daughters. The countryside was also regarded as the best place to raise infantry, and as having an organic harmony between landowner and peasant, unlike the \"race chaos\" of the industrial cities. It also prevented Jews from farming: \"Only those of German blood may be farmers.\"\n\nThe concept was a factor in the requirement of a year of \"land service\" for members of Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls. This period of compulsory service was required after completion of a student's basic education, before he or she could engage in advanced studies or become employed. Although working on a farm was not the only approved form of service, it was a common one; the aim was to bring young people back from the cities, in the hope that they would, then, stay \"on the land\". In 1942, 600,000 boys and 1.4 million girls were sent to help bringing in the harvest. The concept was one of the reasons for the creation of the Reich Harvest Thanksgiving Festival whose main purpose was the recognition of the achievements of the German farmers (as well as the propagation of nationalist, anti-Semitic ideologies).\n\nBlood and soil was one of the foundations of the concept of Lebensraum, \"living space\". By expanding eastward and transforming those lands into breadbaskets, another blockade, such as that of World War I, would not cause massive food shortages, as that one had, a factor that aided the resonance of \"Blood and soil\" for the German population. Even Alfred Rosenberg, not hostile to the Slavs as such, regarded their removal from this land, where Germans had once lived, as necessary because of the unity of blood and soil. \"Mein Kampf\" prescribed as the unvarying aim of foreign policy the necessity of obtaining land and soil for the German people (again, \"German people\" defined by the Nazi Party as racially pure).\n\nWhile discussing the question of Lebensraum to the east, Hitler envisioned a Ukrainian \"breadbasket\" and expressed particular hostility to its \"Russian\" cities as hotbeds of Russianness and Communism, forbidding Germans to live in them and declaring that they should be destroyed in the war. Even during the war itself, Hitler gave orders that Leningrad was to be razed with no consideration given for the survival and feeding of its population. This also called for industry to die off in these regions. The Wehrbauer, or soldier-peasants, who were to settle there were not to marry townswomen, but only peasant women who had not lived in towns. This would also encourage large families.\n\nFurthermore, this land, held by \"tough peasant races\", would serve as a bulwark against attack from Asia.\n\nPrior to the Nazi take-over, two popular genres were the \"Heimat-Roman\", or regional novel, and \"Schollen-Roman\", or novel of the soil, which was also known as \"Blut-und-Boden\". This literature was vastly increased, the term being contracted into a slogan \"Blu-Bo\", and developed a mysticism of unity. It also combined war literature with the figure of the soldier-peasant, uncontaminated by the city. These books were generally set in the nominal past, but their invocation of the passing of the seasons often gave them an air of timelessness. \"Blood and soil\" novels and theater celebrated the (Christian, Aryan) farmer's life and their fertility, often mystically linking them.\n\nOne of the anti-Semitic fabrications in the children's book \"Der Giftpilz\" was the claim that the Talmud described farming as the most lowly of occupations. It also included an account of a Jewish financier forcing a German to sell his farm as seen by a neighbor boy; deeply distressed, the boy resolved never to let a Jew into his house, for which his father praised him, on the grounds that peasants must remember that Jews will always take their land.\n\nDuring the Nazi period in Germany, one of the charges put forward against certain works of art was that \"Art must not be isolated from blood and soil.\" Failure to meet this standard resulted in the attachment of the label, \"degenerate art\", to offending pieces. In art of the Third Reich, both landscape paintings and figures reflected \"blood-and-soil\" ideology. Indeed, some Nazi art exhibits were explicitly titled \"Blood and Soil\". Artists frequently gave otherwise apolitical paintings such titles as \"German Land\" or \"German Oak\". Rural themes were heavily favored in painting. Landscape paintings were featured most heavily in the Greater German Art Exhibitions. While drawing on German Romantic traditions, painted landscapes were expected to be firmly based on real landscapes, the German people's \"Lebensraum\", without religious overtones (other than the implicit suggestion that \"the German people\" excluded German Jews). Peasants were also popular images, promoting a simple life in harmony with nature. This art showed no sign of the mechanization of farm work. The farmer labored by hand, with effort and struggle.\n\nThe acceptance of this art by the peasant family was also regarded as an important element.\n\nUnder Richard Walther Darré, The Staff Office of Agriculture produced the alleged documentary (propaganda film) \"Blut und Boden\", which was displayed at Nazi party meetings as well as in public cinemas throughout Germany. Other \"Blut und Boden\" films likewise stressed the commonality of Germanness and the countryside. \"Die goldene Stadt\" has the heroine running away to the city, resulting in her pregnancy and abandonment; she drowns herself, and her last words beg her father to forgive her for not loving the countryside as he did. The film \"Ewiger Wald\" (\"The Eternal Forest\") depicted the forest as being beyond the vicissitudes of history, and the German people the same because they were rooted in the story; it depicted the forest sheltering ancient (white, Aryan) Germans, Arminius, and the Teutonic Knights, facing the peasants wars, being chopped up by war and industry, and being humiliated by occupation with black soldiers, but culminated in a neo-pagan May Day celebration. In \"The Journey to Tilsit\", the Polish seductress is portrayed as an obvious product of debased \"asphalt culture\" (urbanity) but the virtuous German wife is a country-dweller in traditional costume. Many other commercial films of the Nazi era featured gratuitous, lingering shots of the Nazi landscape and idealized Aryan couples.\n\n\"An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus\" made extensive use of the term, usually in quotation marks, and showing an extensive debt to the Nazi usage.\n\nNorth American white supremacists, white nationalists, Neo-Nazis and members of the alt-right have adopted the slogan. It gained widespread public prominence as a result of the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, when participants carrying torches marched on the University of Virginia campus on the night of 11 August 2017 and were recorded chanting the slogan, among others. The rally was organized to protest the town's planned removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. The rally remained in national news through December 2018 thanks to the trial of James Alex Fields, a white supremacist who purposefully ran his car into a crowd of counter-protestors, killing 32-year old paralegal Heather Heyer. The chant was also heard in October 2017 at the \"White Lives Matter\" rally in Shelbyville, Tennessee.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2071466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071466", "title": "Rate of heat flow", "text": "Rate of heat flow\n\nThe rate of heat flow is the amount of heat that is transferred per unit of time in some material, usually measured in watt (joules per second). Heat is the flow of thermal energy driven by thermal non-equilibrium, so that 'heat flow' is a redundancy (i.e. a pleonasm, and the same for ‘work flow’). Heat must not be confused with stored thermal energy, and moving a hot object from one place to another must not be called heat transfer. But, in spite of all these remarks, it is common in normal parlance to say ‘heat flow’, to talk of ‘heat content’, etc.\n\nThe equation of heat flow is given by Fourier's Law of Heat Conduction.\n\nRate of heat flow = - (heat transfer coefficient) * (area of the body) * (variation of the temperature) / (length of the material)\n\nThe formula for the rate of heat flow is:\n\nformula_2 is the net heat (energy) transfer,\n\nformula_3 is the time taken,\n\nformula_4 is the difference in temperature between the cold and hot sides,\n\nformula_5 is the thickness of the material conducting heat (distance between hot and cold sides),\n\nformula_6 is the thermal conductivity, and\n\nformula_7 is the surface area of the surface emitting heat.\n\nIf a piece of material whose cross-sectional area is formula_7 and thickness is formula_5 with a temperature difference formula_4 between its faces is observed, heat flows between the two faces in a direction perpendicular to the faces. The time rate of heat flow, formula_11, for small formula_2 and small formula_3, is proportional to formula_14. In the limit of infinitesimal thickness formula_5, with temperature difference formula_4, this becomes formula_17, where formula_18 is the time rate of heat flow through the area formula_7, formula_20 is the \"temperature gradient\" across the material, and formula_6, the proportionality constant, is the \"thermal conductivity\" of the material. People often use formula_6, formula_23, or the Greek letter formula_24 to represent this constant. The minus sign is there because the rate of heat flow is always negative—heat flows from the side at higher temperature to the one at lower temperature, not the other way around.\n\n"}

Berman (born 1942) is an American lawyer, public relations executive, and former lobbyist. Through his public affairs firm, Berman and Company, he runs several industry-funded non-profit organizations such as the Center for Consumer Freedom, the Center for Union Facts, and the Employment Policies Institute. His organizations have run numerous media campaigns concerning obesity, soda taxation, smoking, cruelty to animals, mad cow disease, taxes, the national debt, drinking and driving, as well as the minimum wage. Through the courts and media campaigns, his company challenges regulations from consumer, safety and environmental groups.\n\nBerman grew up in the Bronx borough of New York City. His father ran gas stations and car washes. Berman did general labor at these businesses on weekends and summers while growing up. He attended Transylvania University in Kentucky. After graduating from college in 1964, Berman went on to William and Mary School of Law and was class of 1967. His late son was Silver Jews musician David Berman, who died by suicide on August 7, 2019 at age 52. The two had been estranged due to David's strong disapproval of his father's work.\n\nAfter law school, Berman worked as a labor law attorney for Bethlehem Steel, and from 1969 to 1972 he served as a corporate lawyer for Dana, an automotive parts company in Toledo, Ohio. From 1972 to 1974 he was employed as labor law director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C.\n\nHe moved into the food and beverage industry in 1975 under the mentorship of Norman Brinker, founder and owner of the Steak & Ale chain of restaurants. Berman started a government affairs program, launched his first PAC for Brinker, and worked there until 1984. He served as executive vice president of Pillsbury Restaurant Group from 1984 to 1986. In 1986, he formed Berman and Company. In 1991, he created the Employment Policies Institute to research entry-level work issues and argue \"the importance of minimum wage jobs for the poor and uneducated.\" In practice, this translated to opposing minimum wage hikes on the theory that they would reduce employment.\n\nIn the 1990s, Berman was the president of Beverage Retailers Against Drunk Driving (BRADD), an organization formed to combat Mothers Against Drunk Driving. As president, he argued for \"tolerance of social drinking.\" He has also worked as a consultant for the Minimum Wage Coalition to Save Jobs.\n\nIn a document released by \"The New York Times\" on October 30, 2014, from a talk Berman gave to the Western Energy Alliance, Berman reassured potential donors about the concern that they might be found out as a supporter of one of his organizations: \"We run all of this stuff through nonprofit organizations that are insulated from having to disclose donors. There is total anonymity.\" He also touted his \"win ugly\" method of personal attacks on labor union leaders, environmentalists, and others who opposed him.\n\nAs of May 2009, Berman was the sole owner and executive director of Berman and Company, a for-profit management firm that ran fifteen corporate-funded groups, including the Center for Consumer Freedom. He has held at least sixteen positions within these interlocking organizations. As of 2010, just six of these nonprofits provided as much as 70% of Berman and Company's revenue. Bloomberg News reported that from 2008 to 2010, Berman and Company was paid $15 million from donations to his five nonprofit organizations.\nThrough these organizations, Berman and Company has received 60 \"POLLIE Awards\" since 2002 from the American Association of Political Consultants.\n\nOrganizations founded and managed by Berman include:\n\nThe Center for Organizational Research and Education (CORE), formerly the Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF) and Guest Choice Network (GCN), is a non-profit advocate for the food industry and was formed in 1995 with funding from tobacco giant Phillip Morris. CORE generally promotes freedom of choice in the marketplace against what it believes is encroachment by government or scare tactics promulgated by activist groups. CCF also runs the awareness campaign HumaneWatch and PETA Kills Animals, which criticize the practices of HSUS and PETA, respectively. These campaigns raise awareness that \"The Humane Society of the United States gives less than one percent of the money it raises to local pet shelters\", and that \"PETA kills 89% of the adoptable dogs and cats in its care\". Berman's attacks on animal organizations have gained support from many individuals and organizations working in the agriculture and agribusiness sector. In March 2013, Charity Navigator issued a Donor Advisory advising that \"the majority of the Center for Consumer Freedom's program expenses are being directed to its CEO Richard Berman's for-profit management company, Berman and Company\". The \"Chicago Tribune\" depicted CCF as an organization that \"employs razor-sharp wit and unconventional tactics.\"\nBerman and Company does not publicly name its clients; 60 Minutes obtained a list of companies that funded the Center for Consumer Freedom in 2002. Among the parties named were The Coca-Cola Company, Tyson Foods, Outback Steakhouse, Wendy's International, Inc., Brinker International (parent company of Chili's and Macaroni Grill), Arby's, Hooters, and Red Lobster.\n\nThe American Beverage Institute (ABI) is a trade association opposed to laws intended to criminalize alcohol consumption, including the push to further lower existing blood-alcohol arrest thresholds.\n\nThe Employment Policies Institute (EPI) is a nonprofit research center opposed to raising the minimum wage, particularly in the labor-intensive restaurant industry. 'TIME Magazine' described EPI's work as helping to \"lay the groundwork for the minimum-wage fight in 2014.\" \n\nThe Center for Union Facts (CUF) argues that unions are corrupt and bad for workers. It has run full-page ads in major print media outlets (\"New York Times\", \"Wall Street Journal\", and \"The Washington Post\") blaming trade unions for the bankruptcies of American industries. The CUF website purports that it is the largest online database of labor-union reporting on salaries, budgets, and political spending. CUF has produced TV ads alleging intimidation by trade unions. CUF is a non-profit; 2007 federal tax returns showed revenues of $2.5 million, with $840,000 being paid to Berman and Company for management services.\n\nThe Enterprise Freedom Action Committee is a political action committee. The group spent $315,000 on a campaign against Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primaries.\n\nBerman has appeared on \"60 Minutes\", \"The Colbert Report\", and CNN in support of his organizations. \"60 Minutes\" has called him \"the booze and food industries' weapon of mass destruction,\" labor union activist Richard Bensinger gave him the nickname \"Dr. Evil,\" and Michael Kranish of the \"Boston Globe\" dubbed him a \"pioneer\" in the \"realm of opinion molding.\" In September 2013, the \"Huffington Post\" included Berman on its list of \"America's Ruling Class Hall of Shame\", described as a \"sleazy corporate front man.\"\n\nThe Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) and the Restaurant Opportunities Center have criticized Berman. HSUS has carried out its own investigations of CCF and Berman, and filed complaints about CCF with the IRS. CCF has responded by filing its own complaint with the IRS against HSUS.\n\nLabor groups pushing to increase the minimum wage are also taking a tough line against Berman and his clients. The Restaurant Opportunities Center has taken an aggressive approach in its campaigns against Berman's base of support within the National Restaurant Association and related enterprises.\n\nIn a January 4, 2015 article, \"Salon\" criticized Berman as a propagandist, \"a gifted translator of biz-think into the common sense of the millions\".\n\nIn February 3, 2015, an opinion piece in Guns Magazine passed criticism that Berman received for putting profit over principle was countered with the claim that critics have not \"made that case with examples of documented unethical practices, or by refuting anything the man, who decries a government nanny state and endorses personal responsibility, claims.\"\n\nBerman has responded to such criticism by stating that his groups have acted as \"watchdogs who question the motivation, tactics and fundraising efforts of these powerful groups\" and that targets \"throw mud\" instead of \"debating the actual issues\".\n"}

Before it was released, Park Avenue insisted that the band re-record the album at a professional studio, as it was originally recorded at the band's rehearsal studio on a 4-track recorder. When finally released, the album was not promoted and received little attention, only developing a cult following in the band's hometown. Reviewing for \"The Village Voice\" in 1980, Robert Christgau wrote, \"Three guys from Portland (Oregon, but it might just as well be Maine) who caught on to punk unfashionably late and for that reason sound like they're still discovering something. Which hardly makes them unique--there are similar bands in dozens if not hundreds of American cities, many of whom send me records. What distinguishes this one is Greg Sage's hard-edged vocals--detached but never silly, passionate but never overwrought--and economical one-hook construction\".\n\nThe album (and the band's music in general) gained a slightly wider audience during the early 1990s when grunge band Nirvana covered the songs \"Return of the Rat\" and \"D-7\" on a Wipers tribute album and the group's \"Hormoaning\" EP. In 1993, Nirvana vocalist/guitarist Kurt Cobain listed \"Is This Real?\" at No. 46 in the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his \"Journals\". BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel stated in a 1993 interview that it was one of his top 20 favorite albums.\n\n\"Is This Real?\" later came to be regarded as a classic punk rock album of the 1980s. Stephen Howell of AllMusic, in his retrospective review, rated the album 4 out of 5 stars and stated that the production \"leaves much to be desired with its tinny-sounding drums, but fortunately, the negatives don't outweigh the positives.\" He also said that Sage wrote \"fairly simplistic songs with power chords, but each melody infects your brain like a fever\" and noted that much of the album has a dark and ominous feel.\n\nApart from the aforementioned Nirvana cover, \"Return of the Rat\" was also covered by Bored! on their album \"Scuzz\". The track \"Mystery\" was covered by numerous bands including Eagulls, JEFF the Brotherhood, Shellshag, Rose Melberg, and Meat Wave. \"Up Front\" was covered by Poison Idea and Corin Tucker, \"Potential Suicide\" by Napalm Beach, and \"Wait A Minute\" by My Vitriol.\n\n\nProduction\n"}

The band is named after a verse from \"Der Asra\" by Heinrich Heine. They are considered to be one of the most influential bands from the Yugoslav new wave rock era and the Yugoslav rock scene in general.\n\nThey released their first single in 1979 with songs \"Balkan\" and \"A šta da radim\". The first album named \"Azra\" was published in 1980 and achieved commercial success and popularized Azra in Yugoslavia. Their second album was released in 1981. Azra recorded its last studio album \"Između krajnosti\" (\"Between the Extremes\") in 1987. In 1988 the band recorded 4LP live album under the name \"Zadovoljština\" (\"Satisfaction\"), after which Štulić disbanded the band. Štulić recorded three more solo albums since moving to the Netherlands, where he lives in seclusion. A 2003 rock documentary, \"Sretno dijete\" depicts Azra as the focus of the rock scene in Yugoslavia during the 1980s, along with Bijelo dugme. Even today, Azra remains very popular among youth in the countries of the former Yugoslavia.\n\nIn 1998, the music critics compiled a of Yugoslav pop and rock music.

The school contended with the more scientific school in Alexandria. LIke other Neoplatonists of the time, she mainly studied Aristotle and Plato, but also her father’s own philosophy. She lived in a historical context of turmoil due to the conflict between Neoplatonic metaphysics, which was taught in Plutarch’s academy, and Christianity, which had been gaining in popularity at the time.\n\nPlutarch of Athens’ philosophy worked to unify the teachings of Aristotle and Plato, and by doing so brought together the opposing pagan ideas of theurgy and mysticism (magic), which he had learned from his father, Nestorius, and then passed that knowledge onto Asclepigenia. After Plutarch’s death, she inherited the school as well as how it was to go about teaching its students. Being an acclaimed philosopher at the school in Athens, Asclepigenia went on to teach Proclus, who became her best known student. She taught him, not only the philosophies of Aristotle and Plato, but included teachings her father had passed solely on to her before his passing, in the arts of theurgy and pagan mysticism.\n\nBeing the expert in the theurgy, Asclepigenia taught from a metaphysical approach. She believed in there being five realms of reality: the One, Nature, Matter, Soul, and Intelligence. Like her father, she believed that every soul held a divine part inside itself, and that a union with the One, combined with magic, pagan thought of the deities, and meditation could result in true happiness for a person, as a way they could control their own fate. Her teachings to Proclus on theurgy, benefited him greatly as he went on to think and develop his own ideas. He also supposedly was able to practice theurgy in such a way that it cured his friend’s daughter, by use of a divine intervention with one of the gods.\n\nAsclepigenia continued to teach at the Academy after Proclus went on to perfect his theurgical thoughts and practices. Her most well known achievements were in the arts and practicing rituals in the Chaldean mysticism of theurgy, as well as exceptional thought in Platonic philosophy. She passed along many of Aristotle and Plato’s teachings to multiple students, including Plutarch. Her reverence in philosophy, as well as an astute female teacher, only adds to the value and importance of who she was in the Greek world. She contributed greatly to the development of Neoplatonic metaphysics and worked alongside many great philosophers, including her brother Hiero. Her advancements have impacted future thought on the practices of theurgy, as well as the arts and magic of the Chaldean mysticism. She is said to have died in the year 485 A.D.\n"}
