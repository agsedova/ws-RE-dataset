She also serves on the firm's management committee, the \"first partner from the firm's Silicon Valley office to serve, and the second woman ever chosen\".\n\nHermle earned a B.A. in physical anthropology \"magna cum laude\" from the University of California, Santa Barbara and a J.D. from the University of California Hastings College of Law in 1981. She joined Orrick's San Francisco office as a senior associate in 1987 from AT&T where she handled employment matters as in-house counsel. In 1992 she became partner and in 1995 she helped open the firm's office in Menlo Park, California.\n\nHermle has significant experience working on complex discrimination and wage-and-hour class actions for high-profile companies including Apple, The Gap, Morgan Stanley, and others.\n\nHermle led the trial team that defended Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in a gender discrimination lawsuit filed by Ellen Pao in San Francisco. On March 27, 2015, Hermle and the Orrick trial team obtained a complete defense verdict for Kleiner Perkins in \"Pao v. Kleiner Perkins\". Following 24 days of trial, a San Francisco jury rejected all of former partner Ellen Pao's claims that she was passed over for promotion and terminated because of her gender and complaints about discrimination. Hermle was named \"Litigator of the Week\" for this victory by American Lawyer which described her effective voir dire and how she \"steadily poked holes in Pao's testimony.\" The Recorder called Hermle's cross-examination \"masterful\" and \"Bloomberg\" reported that her \"charismatic, intimidating oratory made her the trial's breakout star.\"\n\nHermle also obtained a defense verdict in the high-profile trial of Maghribi v. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) on behalf of AMD. Plaintiff, a senior Arab Muslim executive, sought $200 million in lost salary, bonuses and stock options and emotional distress damages, punitive damages and attorneys' fees, alleging post-September 11 discrimination. After a several-week trial, the jury returned in less than two hours with a defense verdict.\n\nShe also represented all four plaintiffs in \"Varian v.

It is a medium-sized tree that produces quality timber and is the main source of timber amongst the indigenous tree species of desert regions of Shekhawati and Marwar in Rajasthan. The trade name of the tree species is desert teak or Marwar teak.\n\n\"Tecomella undulata\" is a deciduous or nearly evergreen tree of arid and semi arid regions. It occurs on flat and undulating areas including gentle hill slopes and sometimes also in ravines. It is well adapted to drained loamy to sandy loam soil having pH 6.5-8.0. The species thrives very well on stabilized sand dunes, which experience extreme low and high temperatures. It grows in areas of scanty rainfall (annual 150-500mm) and high temperature (35 °C to 48 °C). It can withstand extreme low temperature (0 °C to −2 °C) during winter and high temperature (48 °C to 50 °C) in summers. The tree is a strong light demander. It is drought, frost, fire and wind hardy. At the time of flowering (December–February) it produces beautiful showy flowers in yellow, orange and red colours. Three types of flower bearing trees can be observed near to each other in the same vicinity.\n\nDistribution of \"Tecomella undulata\" is restricted to the drier parts of the Arabia, southern Pakistan and northwest India up to an elevation of 1200 metres. In Pakistan, in the Kala Chitta Range of the Attock District of Punjab, its local name is Haroora. It is found in Baluchistan and Sindh. In India, it occurs naturally in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana.\n\nThe species is mainly found to occur in the western parts of Rajasthan. In other states its population is scanty and very rare. In Rajasthan, \"Tecomella undulata\" is found in Barmer, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Pali, Ajmer, Nagaur, Bikaner, Churu and Sikar, Jalore districts.\n\n\"Tecomella undulata\" is an accepted tree species in agroforestry and large population is found in agricultural lands. It can be observed growing in inhabited areas, forested areas and scrubland habitats in association with \"Prosopis cineraria\", \"Capparis decidua\", \"Maytenus emarginata\", \"Zizyphus spp\" and \"Salvadora spp\". In agricultural areas, it generally grows in association with \"Prosopis cineraria\". Its flower is the state flower of Rajasthan.\n\n\"Tecomella undulata\" is mainly used as a source of timber. Its wood is strong, tough and durable. It takes a fine finish. Heartwood contains quinoid. The wood is excellent for firewood and charcoal. Cattle and goats eat leaves of the tree. Camels, goats and sheep consume flowers and pods.\n\n\"Tecomella undulata\" plays an important role in ecology. It acts as a soil-binding tree by spreading a network of lateral roots on the top surface of the soil. It acts as a windbreak and helps in stabilizing shifting sand dunes. It is considered as the home of birds and provides shelter for other desert wildlife. Shade of tree crown is shelter for the cattle, goats and sheep during summer days.\n\n\"Tecomella undulata\" has got medicinal properties as well. The bark obtained from the stem is used as a remedy for syphilis. It is also used in curing urinary disorders, enlargement of spleen, gonorrhoea, leucoderma and liver diseases. Seeds are used against abscess. Traditionally in Musakhel, Pakistan its flower used for Hepatitis.\n\n"}
{"id": "1920371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920371", "title": "Underdominance", "text": "Underdominance\n\nIn genetics, underdominance (referred to in some texts as \"negative overdominance\") is the opposite of overdominance. It is the selection against the heterozygote, causing disruptive selection and divergent genotypes. Underdominance exists in situations where the heterozygotic genotype is inferior in fitness to either the dominant or recessive homozygotic genotype. Compared to examples of overdominance in actual populations, underdominance is considered more unstable and may lead to the fixation of either allele.\n\nAn example of stable underdominance may occur in individuals who are heterozygotic for polymorphisms that would make them better suited for one of two niches. Consider a situation in which a population is completely homozygotic for an \"A\" allele, allowing exploitation of a particular resource. Eventually, a polymorphic \"a\" allele may be introduced into the population, resulting in an individual who is capable of exploiting a different resource. This would result in an \"aa\" homozygotic invasion of the population due to nonexistent competition of the unexploited resource. The frequency of \"aa\" individuals would increase until the abundance of the \"a\" resource begins to decline. Eventually, the \"AA\" and \"aa\" genotypes would reach equilibrium with each other, with \"Aa\" heterozygotic individuals potentially experiencing a reduced fitness compared to those individuals who are homozygotic for utilization of either resource. This example of underdominance is stable because any shift in equilibrium would result in selection for the rare allele due to increased resource abundance. This compensatory selection would ultimately return the dimorphic system to underdominant equilibrium.\n\nAn example of stable underdominance can be found in the African butterfly species \"Pseudacraea eurytus\", which utilizes Batesian mimicry to escape predation. This species possesses two alleles which each confer an appearance similar to that of another local butterfly species that is toxic to its predator. Individuals who are heterozygous for this trait appear to be intermediate in appearance and thus experience increased predation and lowered overall fitness.\n\nModels of stable underdominance have shown potential in driving the introduction of refractory genes into pest populations that are responsible for the spread of infective diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. A refractory gene alone would not have higher fitness than the native genes, but engineered underdominance may prove effective as a mechanism to spread such a gene. In this model, two genetics constructs are introduced into two non-homologous chromosomes. Each construct is lethal when expressed individually but can be suppressed by the other construct. In this way, individuals with only one of the two constructed genes (heterozygotes) are selected against, but homozygotes with both or neither construct are genetically healthy. Analysis of this model using simple population genetics shows that successful spread of refractory genes using this engineered underdominance is possible with relatively small release of the constructed genotype into the population.\n\nA similar system of manipulation of pest populations was achieved in a population of \"Drosophila melanogaster\" by using a knock-down/rescue system. The genetic construct in this system employs a dsRNAi knockdown of a C-reactive protein, RpL14, as well as a rescue element (a complete copy of the wild type RpL14 gene). Individuals that are heterozygous for this construct experience lowered fitness due to limited restoration of the RpL14 gene, which results in reduced female fertility and delayed development, along with various other mutations that ultimately lower fitness by 70-80%. This system of underdominance allowed manipulation of the population and ultimate fixation of the constructed genotype and has potential applications in a number of settings, including agriculture and the reduction of various pest-carried diseases.\n\n\n"}

A forward, he scored 119 goals in 216 league games during nine seasons of peacetime football in the Football League.\n\nHe began his professional career at Huddersfield Town in 1932, helping the club to a second-place finish in the First Division in 1933–34, before he was signed by Newcastle United three years later. After scoring 73 goals in 112 Second Division games, he was sold on to Manchester United for £6,500 in February 1938. He helped the Red Devils to win promotion in 1937–38, but then the outbreak of war in Europe robbed him of seven full seasons of First Division football. After the war he played for Blackburn Rovers. In May 1947, he transferred to Port Vale, before moving on to non-league Congleton Town in 1948 and Macclesfield Town in 1949, whom he managed from 1951 to 1955.\n\nAfter spells with Whitehall Printers and Dewsbury Moor Welfare, Smith started his professional career with Huddersfield Town in 1932. He made his debut under Clem Stephenson in the 1932–33 campaign, and scored his first First Division goal on 7 January, in a 1–0 win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. He then scored in a 4–0 win over Newcastle United at Leeds Road on 11 February, and seven days later bagged two goals against Aston Villa in a 3–0 win at Villa Park. He added to his tally with strikes against Sunderland, Sheffield Wednesday, Manchester City, and two against Arsenal, to finish his debut season with nine goals in 15 appearances.\n\nHe scored 15 goals in 24 league games in 1933–34, as the Terriers finished as runners-up, three points behind Arsenal. After just six goalless appearances in the 1934–35 campaign, he left Yorkshire to join Newcastle United, who had just recently lost their top-flight status. He was one of manager Tom Mather's first signings. Smith scored 16 goals to finish as the club's top scorer, though they finished ten points short of Bolton Wanderers in the promotion places. Smith continued to be the Magpies' main target man in 1935–36, scoring 26 goals, though Newcastle again finished with 46 points, this time nine points behind second placed Charlton Athletic. The 1936–37 season was his final full season at St James' Park, and Smith scored 24 goals; this time Newcastle finished fourth, six points behind promoted Blackpool.\n\nNewcastle faced a relegation battle in 1937–38, and Smith was transferred to Walter Crickmer's Manchester United for a club record £6,500 in February 1938. He scored on his debut in a win over Barnsley at Oakwell on 2 February, and totalled eight goals in 1937–38, as United finished in second place and were thus promoted back into the top-flight. The Red Devils then consolidated their First Division status with a 14th-place finish in 1938–39, Smith scoring six goals. The outbreak of World War II then meant that the Football League was suspended for seven whole seasons. Smith was prolific in the War League Western Division in 1939–40, scoring 16 goals in United's 22 matches. He stayed at Old Trafford in 1940–41, bagging 26 goals in the War League North Regional League, including five against Blackburn Rovers on 28 December. In 1941–42 he hit 18 goals, as United finished fourth in the first edition of the War League North Regional League, before winning the second instalment of the competition.\n\nSmith hit 36 goals in 1942–43, hitting hat-tricks against Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, Wrexham (home and away), Everton, and Crewe Alexandra. He stayed on for the 1943–44 season, and hit 35 goals, bagging hat-tricks against Stockport County, Oldham Athletic, and Burnley; United finished second behind Blackpool in the first instalment of the regional league. He scored nine goals in 1944–45, and hit a hat-trick past Burnley in front of newly appointed manager Matt Busby. Smith struck 17 times in 1945–46, including once against Accrington Stanley at Peel Park in first edition of the FA Cup since the outbreak of war. He did not, however, score a goal during the 1946–47 campaign, as Busby led his team to a second-place finish in the First Division, one point behind Liverpool.\n\nOfficially, Smith is recognised as having scored 15 league and cup goals for United during his career, but he also scored over 150 goals during the war. These goals are not counted towards the official total as they are classified as friendlies. During the war he also guested for Burnley and Blackburn Rovers. He left Manchester United after 15 goals in 41 league and cup games, and joined Eddie Hapgood's Blackburn Rovers for a £3,000 fee in March 1946. He was signed by Gordon Hodgson's Port Vale for a four-figure fee in May 1947. He scored on the penultimate day of the 1946–47 season, in a 4–2 win over Crystal Palace at The Old Recreation Ground. Smith enjoyed regular football until he pulled a stomach muscle in November 1947, which kept him out of action for four months. He recovered by March 1947 and regained him first team spot, but refused new terms at the end of the 1947–48 season and was transferred to Cheshire County League side Congleton Town, having scored 10 goals for the Valiants in 29 appearances in the Third Division South.\n\nHe moved on to Macclesfield Town and scored 33 goals in the 1950–51 season to become the club's top-scorer, lifting the Cheshire Senior Cup at the end of the campaign. He was appointed as manager in October 1951, and guided the Silkmen to the Cheshire County League title in 1952–53.\n\nSource:\n\n\n"}

It is part of the municipal unit of Erisos. It is the northernmost port of Kefalonia, a short distance from Ithaca. Fiskardo has a small and diminishing fishing fleet. The coast around Fiskardo is mainly rocky with numerous pebble-beached coves. The port serves ferry routes to the ports of Frikes (Ithaca) and Lefkada. It is 5 km north of Vasilikades, 24 km north of Sami and 32 km north of Argostoli. Cephalonia International Airport is 61 km to the south, by road (about 1½ hours). The community of Fiskardo consists of the villages Fiskardo, Evreti, Katsarata, Matsoukata and Tselentata.\n\nFiskardo is also the name of the two kilometre long bay in which the port is located. Fiskardo and the dense forest in the surrounding area have been declared areas of great natural beauty and are protected under Greek law. In recent years a small tourist industry has developed, centred on luxury villas in the area around the village.\n\nFiskardo has been identified with the ancient town Panormos, mentioned by the 5th-century BC Greek historian Herodotus. In late 2005, when building a shopping complex close to the harbour in Fiscardo, workers discovered a plaque dating back to ancient Greece which gave thanks to the people of Panormos from the people of Athens for allowing them to hunt in the area. In late 2006 construction workers building a new hotel near the centre of Fiskardo stumbled upon a perfectly preserved Roman-era grave complex filled with gold jewellery, glass, clay pots and bronze artefacts. The complex measures 26 by 20 feet and is the shape of small house. Inside, five burial sites were found including a large vaulted grave and a stone coffin, as well as gold jewellery, pottery and bronze offerings. Archaeologists found gold earrings and rings, gold leaves that may have been attached to ceremonial clothing, as well as glass and clay pots, bronze artefacts decorated with masks, a bronze lock and copper coins. On a nearby plot, archaeologists also discovered a remarkably well-preserved theatre with their stone back rests still in place. Other excavations have uncovered remains of houses, a baths complex and a cemetery, all dating to Roman times - between 146 B.C. and 330 A.D. The Greek Culture Ministry said at the time that the find is unique. “Nothing else like it has ever been discovered on any Ionian island,\" said a ministry spokesman. “The site was missed by grave robbers and was untouched when opened. It is so perfectly preserved that the 2000-year-old ancient door still swings open smoothly on stone pivots.” \n\nDuring the time of Frankish (Norman) dominion in Greece, the village was renamed \"Fiskardo\" after Robertus Wiscardus (Robert Guiscard), Duke of Apulia and Calabria and founder of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies who died at the Atheras beach in 1085. In the 18th century, the port became the commercial harbor of Erisos. Unlike most of Cephalonia, Fiskardo escaped from destruction by the 1953 Ionian earthquake and it has kept its original architecture. In Fiscardo lived the poet and writer Nikos Kavvadias (1910-1975).\n\n\n"}

Glove puppets are a variation of hand puppets. Rod puppets require one of the puppeteer's hands inside the puppet glove holding a rod which controls the head, and the puppet's body then hangs over most or all of the forearm of the puppeteer, and possibly extends further. Other parts of the puppet may be controlled by different means, e.g., by rods operated by the puppeteer's free hand, or strings or levers pulled the head or body. A smaller variety, simple hand puppets often have no significant manipulable parts at all. Finger puppets are not hand puppets as they are used only on a finger.\n\nThe simplest hand puppets are those with few or no moving parts. They can be stiff, made from e.g. a hard plastic, but are more often flexible, made from fabric, possibly with some stuffing and attached decorations for eyes, nose, and so on. The mouth may be a mere decoration that does not open and close, or the thumb may enter a separate pocket from the rest of the fabric and so simulate a mandible, allowing the puppet to talk.\n\nSimple hand puppets are usually not much larger than the hand itself. A sock puppet is a particularly simple type of hand puppet made from a sock. A glove puppet is slightly more complex, with an internal division for fingers allowing independent manipulation of a character's arms. The unconsumed hand of the puppeteer is usually concealed from the audience to maintain the illusion of the puppet.\n\nSimple hand puppets, especially popular licensed characters, are sometimes distributed as children toys or party favors. Children usually like to experiment in play with a puppet creating voices and movements and in many cases staging a strictly private performance.\n\nA rod puppet is made out of wood wire and string and is manipulated with wooden or wire rods. Rod puppets can sometimes have a complete working hinged mouth but many do not. A rod puppet can have a fixed facial expression. Arms are usually a requirement as rods are attached to them. A fish rod puppet could have a rod attached to the tail to manipulate this section of the puppet. Sometimes special variants exist with additional manipulable parts: (e.g., eyelids that open and close). Many rod puppets depict only the upper half of the character, from the waist up, with the stage covering the missing remainder, but variations sometimes have legs. The legs usually just dangle, but in special cases the legs may be controlled either from behind the stage using rods from below. These are mostly used at carnivals or fairs. A very common example of rod puppets are those of The Muppets and \"Sesame Street\".\n\nAlso called a \"two-man puppet\" or a \"live-hand puppet\", the human-arm puppet is similar to a hand puppet but is larger and requires two puppeteers. One puppeteer places their dominant hand inside the puppet's head and operates the puppet's head and mouth, while putting their non-dominant arm into a glove and special sleeve attached to the puppet. The second puppeteer puts their arm into a glove and special sleeve attached to the puppet in order to operate the other arm. This way, the puppet can perform hand gestures. This is a form of glove or hand puppetry and rod puppetry. Some puppets from The Muppets and Sesame Street fit this category.\n\nAs with any stage performer, the puppet should generally face the audience; but may turn to one side or the other. There are times when a puppet does turn its back to an audience just like an actor. Puppets generally should look out towards an audience and not up at the ceiling unless they wish an audience to follow their line of vision. Generally a hand or glove puppet should talk a lot.\n\nOne of the most important techniques in puppetry is continuous motion. A puppet that remains still has a dull, lifeless appearance and is said to be \"dead\". Motion should shift from one portion of the puppet to another, so that one moment the puppet is moving its head and the next moment shifting its torso or repositioning an arm. The puppet may shift from side to side, look around, lean or straighten, fidget (with part of the stage, its own clothing or hair, or any available object), cross or uncross its arms, sigh, tilt its head, or make any number of other small motions, in order to continue to appear lifelike.\n\nDepending on the type of puppet, more or less complex motion may be possible. Unrealistic motion patterns can sometimes be useful for special effect purposes. As put into words by Oscar Wilde, puppets \"are admirably docile\" and \"recognize the presiding intellect of the dramatist\".\n\nA puppet should not move when another puppet is speaking. To do so confuses an audience as to which particular puppet is speaking at any given time. Maintaining clear focus for an audience in a puppet performance is extremely important.\n\n\n\n"}

The elder King was a Liberal Member of Parliament in the nineteenth century, and a Senator from 1896 until his death in 1928.\n\nThe younger King earned his MD from McGill University in 1895. After practicing medicine for a short period in New Brunswick, he moved to the Kootenay region of British Columbia in 1898 serving a large rural territory. In 1910, he attended an international medical conference in Budapest, and played a leading role in establishing the American College of Surgeons in Chicago, serving as a governor of the college. In 1932, he was created a Knight of Grace of the Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem for his services to medicine.\n\nIn 1903, King was elected as a British Columbia Liberal Party member of the British Columbia Legislative Assembly for the riding of Cranbrook and was re-elected in 1907 before leaving provincial politics in 1909 to return to medicine.\n\nA supporter of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, King was a Liberal candidate in the riding of Kootenay in the 1911 federal election but was defeated. He returned to the provincial legislature in 1916, joining the provincial cabinet as Minister of Public Works. He served in that portfolio until 1922 when he was offered a federal Cabinet position by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. J.H. King became Minister of Public Works shortly before winning a by-election to enter the House of Commons of Canada as MP for Kootenay East.\n\nIn 1926, King became Minister of Soldiers’ Civil Reestablishment and minister responsible for the Department of Health. In 1928, he became the country's first Minister of Pensions and National Health. He was appointed to the Senate on Prime Minister Mackenzie King's recommendation on June 7, 1930, shortly before the defeat of Mackenzie King's government.\n\nIn 1942, King returned to Cabinet as Leader of the Government in the Canadian Senate. In this capacity, he attended the June 1945 San Francisco Conference that established the United Nations. In August 1945, he was appointed Speaker of the Senate of Canada chairing sessions of the upper house until 1949. He then served as co-chairman of the joint Senate–House of Commons Committee on Old Age Security which reported in 1950. King remained a Senator until his death in 1955. He died in office, and was buried in British Columbia, at Ocean View Cemetery in Burnaby.\n"}
{"id": "1920416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920416", "title": "Australia's Next Top Model", "text": "Australia's Next Top Model\n\nAustralia's Next Top Model was an Australian reality television series which premiered on 11 January 2005 and concluded on 22 November 2016, and was based on Tyra Banks' \"America's Next Top Model\". It was broadcast on the Australian subscription television channel, Fox8.\n\nThe series featured a group of young female contestants who attended preliminary auditions across Australia with finalists selected to star in the series proper, where they ended up living together in a house for several weeks whilst taking part in lectures, challenges, photo shoots and meetings with members of the modelling industry. Normally, one contestant was eliminated each week until the last contestant remaining was declared \"Australia's Next Top Model\" and received a modelling contract and other associated prizes, usually a feature spread in an Australian fashion magazine, a cash prize, a new car and meetings with modelling agencies with the intention of securing future work.\n\nEach episode of \"Top Model\" covered the events of roughly a week of real time (however, while overseas, an episode might cover a shorter period), and featured a fashion challenge, a photo shoot and/or commercial, a critique of each contestant and her performance by the judging panel, and the elimination of one or more contestants.\n\nIn the eighth season Jennifer Hawkins became the host of the series. Fashion designer Alex Perry is also currently a judge. Previous judges have included model Erika Heynatz, former \"Harper's Bazaar\" managing editor Marguerite Kramer, fashion stylist Ken Thompson, fashion producer Victoria Fisher, fashion photographer Georges Antoni, model-turned-designer Jodhi Meares, model-actress Sarah Murdoch, TV personality Charlotte Dawson and fashion photographer Jez Smith. In season 10, Megan Gale joined the panel. Usually there is an additional guest judge every week. There was a position of model mentor who was not a permanent judge but appeared in almost every episode of the season. In season 9 Didier Cohen and Cheyenne Tozzi served as mentors.\n\nIn the first two series, contestants had to be at least 18 years old. However, the show lowered the age limit after realizing that most international models started their career earlier. Starting from season 3, contestants must be aged between 16 and 23 at the time of filming. Those auditioning had to be at least 172 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall. In the past, some contestants had weighed less than 60 kg, but there was no restriction on weight.\n\n\"Australia's Next Top Model\" shared the format of its American counterpart, but there were a few differences. On \"America's Next Top Model\" the final two models compete in a runway fashion show and the winner is chosen in the judging room. Starting from season 3, the final two contestants competed in front of a live studio audience in Sydney before the winner was revealed live-to-air. The judges, sponsors, and fashion professionals voted for the winner, along with the TV viewing public, whose votes contributed 15 per cent to the overall tally. Beginning with season 6, the format was changed. The final three (not two) were interviewed, shown their best bits from the competition, and participated in a runway show. The viewer votes decided the winner of the competition. From season 9 and onward, the show returned to pre-recorded finals.\n\nFollowing a breach of contract with Heynatz's appearance on the Channel Seven series \"It Takes Two\", she was replaced as host by Jodhi Meares, who was consistently scrutinized for her lack of involvement in the show. During the season 3 live finale, she made a number of embarrassing blunders that drew commentary from critics on her ability to host. Things worsened when she pulled out of her hosting duties hours before the season 4 live finale. The swarm of negative comments from the press and fans of the show led to Meares' withdrawal from the programme.\n\nIn season 4, Demelza Reveley's win provoked negative feedback from critics and the public due to her bullying of another contestant. During the finale, \"Vogue\" Australia's editor-in-chief, Kirstie Clements, and judge Charlotte Dawson voted in favor of fellow contestant Alexandra Girdwood because of Reveley's behaviour. The judges' scores were tied, so the decision came down to the public, who voted for Reveley.\n\nAfter season 5, runner-up Cassi Van Den Dungen made a series of highly controversial comments. She was offered modeling contracts by Priscilla's Model Management in Australia and Elite Model Management in New York City. Cassi turned down both offers and quit modeling in order to remain in Sunbury with her boyfriend, Brad Saul, causing a backlash from the public, as well as from judges Alex Perry and Charlotte Dawson, who had vouched for Cassi on the show and urged her to pursue modeling. Cassi later stated in the press that she rejected the Elite contract because she didn't want to be pressured to drop from a size six to a four.\n\nIn the season 6 live final, the TV viewers voted to decide the winner. Initially, Sarah Murdoch announced Kelsey Martinovich as the winner of \"Australia's Next Top Model\". Moments after Martinovich had made her victory speech, Murdoch stopped the celebrations and announced that Amanda Ware was the winner of season 6. An embarrassed Murdoch apologised repeatedly to Martinovich and the audience, stating that the final result was fed to her wrong. As compensation for the error, Foxtel awarded Martinovich a A$25,000 cash prize and an all-expenses paid trip to New York. \"Harper's Bazaar\" decided to release both Ware and Martinovich's covers for the November issue. In the days following the bungled announcement, top industry commentators expressed skepticism about whether the episode was a publicity stunt, with the editor of \"Harper's Bazaar\" Edwina McCann accusing Foxtel of manipulating the result. \"The network did want Amanda to win ... They kept the voting lines open for a long time I think in the hope that she would get over the line. I'm told that it came down to three votes,\" she told the Nine Network.\n\nIn episode 6 of season 8, Taylah Roberts choked Ashley Pogmore after a painting challenge. Roberts was confronted by host Jennifer Hawkins at panel and she was ultimately disqualified from the competition. Before the footage was aired on television, the incident had been covered by several media outlets. It was also noted that while the disqualification might have been the proper course of action, it was still incorrect to showcase the occurrence as a selling point to draw in more viewers for the show.\n\n\n"}

Instead of the clear and logical construction of a normal nineteenth-century realist novel, the novel makes use of surreal devices of metaphor and playful narrative construction. It is considered the first romance of the realist movement in Brazil.\n\nThe novel is narrated by the dead protagonist Brás Cubas, who tells his own life story from beyond the grave, noting his mistakes and failed romances.\n\nThe fact of being already deceased allows Brás Cubas to sharply criticize the Brazilian society and reflect on his own disillusionment, with no sign of remorse or fear of retaliation. Brás Cubas dedicates his book: \"To the worm who first gnawed on the cold flesh of my corpse, I dedicate with fond remembrance these Posthumous Memoirs\" (), which indicates that not a single person he met through his life deserved the book. Cubas decides to tell his story starting from the end (the passage of his death, caused by pneumonia), then taking \"the greatest leap in this story\", proceeding to tell the story of his life since his childhood.\n\nThe novel is also connected to another Machado de Assis work, \"Quincas Borba\", which features a character from the \"Memoirs\" (as a secondary character, despite the novel's name), but other works of the author are hinted in chapter titles. It is a novel recalled as a major influence by many post-modern writers, such as John Barth or Donald Barthelme, as well as Brazilian writers in the 20th century.\n\nBras Cubas' pessimism is shown most obviously in the sub-title of the novel, \"Epitaph of a Small Winner\". Cubas considers his life in the manner of an accounting, finding neither any positives or negatives; but he then realises that since he has not fathered any children he has not passed on the \"misery\" of life any further. For this reason he considers his life a success. Assis published his work in 1881 and it is influenced by the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, a German philosopher whose philosophical magnum opus, \"The World as Will and Representation\" was first published in 1818. Schopenhauer's influence on the novel's philosophy is without doubt when one compares Cubas' description of insects and his attitude towards animals, which is a feature of Schopenhauer's philosophical outlook; and in Schopenhauer's writing he similarly uses examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate a philosophical truth (most famously that of the Australian bull-ant). Assis' allusion to Schopenhauer's philosophy is also 'formal': the chapter structure of \"The Posthumous Memoirs\" mimics that of Schopenhauer's \"World as Will and Representation\"; Bras Cubas' \"method\" in the novel, specifically the practice of referring to incidents in previous chapters by the chapter number, is imitative. Schopenhauer is often referred to as the 'King' of pessimists, or the 'Philosopher of despair'; his outlook is heavily linked to that of Buddhism.\n\nIt is important to note that Assis created a philosophical theory to criticize Scientism, which was common in Brazil's literature back then. The theory in question was Humanitism, created in the books by Quincas Borba, a friend of Brás Cubas who had gone mad before dying. By doing this, Assis sharply criticizes the current philosophical theories, implying that only someone crazy would believe in them. \nHumanitism is to believe in Humanitas, which, according to Borba, is \"the principle of the things, the same man equally distributed in all men\". Therefore, if all men are equally Humanitas, an executioner killing a convict of murder is just \"Humanitas correcting Humanitas because of an infraction of the laws of Humanitas\". Envy is just \"an admiration that fights for Humanitas against Humanitas\", and thus, \"being the war the grand function of the human genus, all the pugnacious feeling are the most adequate to happiness. From this, I came to the conclusion: envy is a virtue\". If envy is a virtue, then cynicism, vanity and egoism are legitimated. Assis, through an ingenious fallacy, implied that envy is positive, in the same way many theories could \"prove\" true something clearly absurd looking through today's eyes.\n\nIn an article in The Guardian, Woody Allen listed the work as one of his favorites. He said in an interview with the newspaper:\n\n"}

{"id": "1920448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920448", "title": "Brisbane Bullets", "text": "Brisbane Bullets\n\nThe Brisbane Bullets are an Australian professional men's basketball team in the National Basketball League (NBL) based in Brisbane, Queensland. They competed from 1979 to 2008, and returned to the league in 2016. Brisbane were one of ten NBL foundation teams and have won three NBL championships, being successful in the 1985 and 1987 seasons, and again in 2007. They also competed in the 1984, 1986 and 1990 grand finals. The team reached the playoffs 21 times in their illustrious 30-year history.\n\nOn 30 June 2008, it was announced that the Bullets license had been returned to the NBL, following financial difficulties for owner Eddy Groves and the failure of attempts to find a new ownership group.\n\nFor the 2014–15 season, the NBL hoped for the return of a Brisbane-based franchise, bringing up the possibility of a Bullets resurrection. These hopes finally came to fruition on 17 September 2015, with the Bullets being revived for a return to the NBL in 2016–17.\n\nThe Bullets were established in 1979 by Brisbane Amateur Basketball Association for the foundation season of the National Basketball League, under the captaincy of Bruce Fitzgerald, and head coach Bob Young. Of the 18 games played during the inaugural NBL season, Brisbane won 13 and lost five, finishing in fifth place. Brisbane's Cal Bruton finished as the league's highest points per game scorer of the season.\n\nThe Bullets made it to the finals in the second NBL season of 1980. Dave Claxton took over as head coach as well. Finishing in third place, winning 17 of their 22-season games, the Bullets met the West Adelaide Bearcats in the second semi-final, losing 101–94. Brian Banks made the All-NBL first team that season. Banks became the Bullets' captain the following season. After making the finals in the second season, Brisbane did so again in 1981. Brisbane finished in fifth place, but first-placed St. Kilda did not attend the finals, as they were in Brazil contesting the World Club Championship. The Bullets lost to Launceston Casino City 71–69 in the first semi-final. In 1982, with new coach Rick Harden, the Bullets missed out on qualifying for the finals, finishing eighth. In the following season, they finished fifth, still outside of finals contention. Import guard Ron \"The Rat\" Radliff, known for his long curly hair and brilliant outside shooting, played his first season for the Bullets and in the NBL in 1983.\n\nUnder new coach Brian Kerle, who would go on to win the 1984 Coach of the Year award, the Bullets' first playoffs appearance since 1981 came about after finishing the 1984 regular season in first place with a 19–5 record, a major improvement on their 10–12 record in 1983. After defeating the Coburg Giants and the Geelong Supercats in the finals, the team were into their first ever NBL Grand Final with the game to be played at The Glass House in Melbourne (1984 would be the last year that the NBL Grand Final was played at a pre-determined 'neutral' venue). Unfortunately, they were not successful in capturing their first championship, losing to the defending champion Canberra Cannons 84–82 who were led by the Australian Boomers point guard Phil Smyth. Star import Leroy Loggins, who had returned to the Bullets in 1984 after two seasons with the West Adelaide Bearcats, capped off a great season with the Bullets by winning his first of 3 NBL Most Valuable Player Awards as well as being named at Small forward in the All-NBL Team.\n\nThe Bullets had emerged as the league's most powerful team under Brian Kerle and again finished in first place the 1985 season with a 20–6 record, and were again Grand Finalists after a hard fought win over the Cannons in the finals. With the game being held at their home venue, the Chandler Arena, the Bullets were still favourites to defeat the Adelaide 36ers (who's merger with the Bearcats in 1985 had seen them become an NBL force for the first time) in what was to be the last single game grand final in NBL history despite the 36ers defeating the Newcastle Falcons by the record score of 151–103 in their Semi-final. Leading 78–74 going into the last period of play, the Bullets then outscored Adelaide 42–21, setting an NBL grand final record for points scored in the final period and easily accounting for the 36ers 120–95 to record their first ever championship win.\n\nThe team's major change during the 1986 season was when they moved out of the 2,700 seat Chandler Arena and into the brand new Brisbane Entertainment Centre which could seat up to 13,500 fans, easily giving the Bullets the largest and newest home arena in the NBL at the time (the next largest venue in the league was The Glass House which could only seat 7,200). Indeed, the Entertainment Centre was not only the NBL's but also Australia's then largest indoor arena. They finished the regular season in third place with a 17–8 record but progressed to their third Grand Final in a row with wins over the Sydney Supersonics and regular finals opponent Canberra in the playoffs. In the first ever NBL grand final series to be played over three games, the Bullets went down to the Ken Cole coached Adelaide 36ers 2–1, losing Game 3 of the series 113–91 in Adelaide (the 36ers had a league leading 24–2 record for the season including a 13–0 record at home). In the opening game, over 11,000 fans, a then indoor sports attendance record in Australia, saw the 36ers defeat the Bullets 122–119 in overtime at the Entertainment Centre, while they became the only team to defeat the 36ers in Adelaide in 1986 when they won Game 2 104–83 at the Apollo Stadium. Leroy Loggins was again voted the league's MVP in 1986, giving himself and Brisbane a second MVP title while he was again a unanimous selection to the All-NBL Team. Crucially though, Loggins fouled out of both Game 1 and 3 of the Grand Final series which limited his on court impact.\n\n1987 saw the Bullets back to second on the ladder (again behind only Adelaide) with a 20–6 season, earning themselves a bye in the playoffs until the Semi-finals. There they defeated the Illawarra Hawks two games to one to advance to a league record fourth grand final in a row, where this time they were up against the Perth Wildcats in their first ever Grand Final series after upsetting the 36ers 2–1 in their Semi-final series. Perth were player/coached by former Bullets favourite Cal Bruton, who had left the club at the end of 1986 after a public falling out with Brian Kerle. Bruton had successfully turned the Wildcats into a championship contender with the addition of forwards Kendall \"Tiny\" Pinder and the \"Alabama Slamma\" James Crawford. The Bullets won their second NBL championship, winning the first game 80–79 in a thriller in Perth, before taking out Game 2 106–87 at the Entertainment Centre in Brisbane. Leroy Loggins continued to star for the Bullets, and in 1987, he won his third MVP award (shared with Adelaide's 1986 Grand Final MVP Mark Davis), as well as being voted as the Grand Final MVP for the series win over the Wildcats (although the Grand Final MVP was his first official award, Loggins had also been the player of the game with 41 points in the 1985 Grand Final victory).\n\nThe Bullets finished the 1988 regular season in third place with an 18–6 record, but they couldn't manage to reach their fifth grand final in a row after losing in the elimination final. A highlight of the 1988 season for the Bullets was first year player Shane Heal winning the NBL's Rookie of the Year award. The 1989 season saw the team fail to make the playoffs for the first time since 1983 when they finished the regular season in eighth place with an 11–13 record. In the wake of this disappointing season, the Bullets' line-up was extensively overhauled: Leroy Loggins, Greg Fox, and Robert Sibley were the only players from the 1989 Bullets team to continue with the club for the 1990 season, while both Larry Sengstock and Ron Radliff left to join the NBL's second Queensland-based team, the Gold Coast Cougars, for its inaugural season in 1990.\n\nBoosted by new imports Derek Rucker and Andre Moore, the Bullets made a huge turn around in 1990, finishing in third place and going 18–8 for the season. They would again win their way into the grand final, again playing the Perth Wildcats. This time however the Bullets went down 2–1, losing Game 3 at home 109–86. Game 2 of the series, with the Bullets levelling at one game all with a 106–90 win, saw a then NBL grand final record crowd of 13,221 at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre. This would stand the highest ever grand final crowd for a game played outside of Melbourne until 13,527 saw Game 2 of the 2012–13 Grand Final series between the Wildcats and New Zealand Breakers at Perth Arena. The attendance remains the eighth largest for an NBL Grand Final game. Brian Kerle won his second Coach of the Year award, while new import guard Derek Rucker becoming the second Bullets player to win the NBL's MVP award.\n\nThe 1991 season was not nearly as successful, as the team finished in ninth place, way out of finals contention with a 13–13 record. However, in 1992, the Bullets were back in the finals, making it to the quarter-finals. In 1993, former NBL Coach of the Year (1988) and championship winning coach of the North Melbourne Giants (1989) Bruce Palmer became the new Bullets coach, and the team made it as far as the semi-finals.\n\nFrom 1994 through to the 1996 seasons, the Bullets made it as far as the quarter-finals, finishing in fifth, sixth and eighth place respectively. David Ingham took over as head coach for the 1996 and 1997 seasons, with Brian Kerle returning to the club to coach the Bullets from 1998 to 2000. During this time, the high cost of playing home games at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre (along with falling attendances) forced the Bullets to move to the smaller (4,000) capacity Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre from the 1998 season.\n\nThe Bullets failed to get to the finals during the early years of the 2000s. The 2000–01 season was especially disappointing for the Bullets, as they finished second-last on the regular season table, winning just 4 of their 28 fixtures. Although, the Bullets won 22 of their 33 fixtures in 2003–04 to finish in a more respectable fourth place on the ladder.\n\nThe team qualified for the finals in the 2004–05 and the 2005–06 seasons. They finished in fifth place in 2005–06, and hosted the Perth Wildcats at home in Game 1, though they lost 96–91 and were eliminated.\n\nThe addition of veteran Australian Boomers centre and the NBL's all-time leading rebounder Mark Bradtke after the 2005–06 season saw expectations rise for the Bullets once more. During the 2006–07 pre-season Blitz, the Bullets won all three of their group stage games to finish at the top of Pool A and advance to the quarter-finals. Defeating the Wollongong Hawks and the Sydney Kings to make it into the final, the Bullets went on to defeat the Melbourne Tigers to win the pre-season title.\n\nFollowing on from their pre-season success, the Bullets easily won the minor premiership for the 2006–07 season, claiming an end of season record of 28 wins and only five losses. This included an all-time NBL record-breaking 21-game winning streak, marking the Bullets' most successful season in their history. After defeating the Sydney Kings in the semis, Brisbane made their first NBL grand final since 1990. They took out the finals series 3–1 over defending champions the Melbourne Tigers to be crowned NBL champions for a third time.\n\nIn March 2008, following the 2007–08 season, the Bullets' childcare-centre mogul owner Eddy Groves – who had run into financial strife with his ABC Learning Centres empire – announced he would be forced to sell the club. On 16 April 2008, Logan businessman David Kemp was officially announced as the new owner. However, Kemp pulled out of the sale, and attempts to find a new ownership group were unsuccessful. On 30 June 2008, it was announced that the Bullets' license had been returned to the NBL.\n\nIn August 2011, Basketball Australia CEO Larry Sengstock revealed that there had been significant progress towards returning a team to Brisbane for the 2012–13 season and that he wanted the team to be called the Bullets. However, in May 2012, the NBL announced that the Bullets' return was rejected, on the heels of another Queensland-based team, the Gold Coast Blaze, going into administration.\n\nIn November 2013, with the NBL under new management, CEO Fraser Neill announced that bringing the Bullets back to Brisbane was a priority. In March 2014, the #BringBackTheBullets social media campaign across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram commenced with an aim to raise awareness for the return of professional basketball to Brisbane as soon as possible.\n\nAfter years of public outcry to have a Brisbane team back in the NBL, moves were finally put in place to have the Bullets return to the league for the 2016–17 season in September 2015. It was announced that the team would primarily adopt the traditional Queensland sporting colours of maroon and gold as well as retaining their blue heritage colour, plus return to their former home venue at the Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre, Southbank. The Bullets' traditional colours of blue and gold was brought back for the 2017–18 season.\n\nThe Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre was the home court for the Brisbane Bullets from 1998 to 2008. When the NBL first started, the team was based at the Auchenflower Stadium and remained there until 1983 before moving to the larger Sleeman Sports Centre at the start of the 1984 season. The Bullets remained at Chandler until they moved into the 13,500 seat Brisbane Entertainment Centre midway through 1986, staying at Boondall until the end of the 1997 season. From 1986 until the South East Melbourne Magic and Melbourne Tigers started using the 15,400 capacity National Tennis Centre (now Rod Laver Arena) in 1992, the BEC was the largest and most modern venue used in the NBL.\n\nAlthough the Brisbane Convention Centre was the Bullets home venue at the time, for the 2007 NBL Grand Final series against the Melbourne Tigers, they moved to the larger capacity Brisbane Entertainment Centre.\n\nThe Brisbane Entertainment Centre was the site of the NBL's first 10,000 plus Grand Final attendance when 11,000 fans saw Game 1 of the 1986 Grand Final series between the Bullets and the Adelaide 36ers. The largest attendance for the Bullets was on 26 October 1990 when 13,221 fans saw them defeat the Perth Wildcats 106–90 in Game 2 of the 1990 Grand Final series.\n\nThe move to the BEC was a risky one as it was (at the time) almost twice the capacity of the NBL's next largest venue, the 7,200 seat Glass House in Melbourne. However, the move was a success with the Bullets pulling in record attendances and it was the move to the BEC that was the catalyst for growth in the NBL. Previously teams had played out of small arena's and even local sports centres (e.g. Auchenflower Stadium) which had limited seating. Indeed, the smallest venue in the NBL at the time was the 1,500 seat Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium in Perth (in 1985 the average size NBL venue was just 3,008. By 1992 the average size had risen to 7,155). In the years following Brisbane's move, other large venues such as the Perth Entertainment Centre (8,200), Sydney Entertainment Centre (12,500), Clipsal Powerhouse (8,000) and the National Tennis Centre (15,300) became regular NBL venues with other teams following the lead of the Bullets.\n\nWith their return to the NBL in 2016, the Bullets chose the Convention Centre as their regular home venue, and the Entertainment Centre in Boondall as their alternate venue. However, with the construction of Nissan Arena in 2019, the Bullets chose to relocate to combine their front office, training centre and stadium into one facility.\n\n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Leroy Loggins was also the Player of the Game in the 1985 NBL Grand Final win, but there was no official Grand Final MVP awarded in 1985.\n\nSource: www.nbl.com.au\n\n<section begin=roster />\n\n<section end=roster />\n"}

It was founded in 1942, and was purchased by the Anglo-Dutch company Unilever in 1996. Besides its own traditional brands, it now produces many of the same products as other Unilever Heartbrand subsidiaries, such as Langnese in Germany.\n\nIn 2005, the Swedish company was criticized by the Centre against Racism and Related Intolerance after launching an advertising campaign introducing their new line of ice cream bars, the Nogger Black, which is an addition to their existing \"Nogger\" ice cream product. The original Nogger is a vanilla ice cream bar with a nougat filling and chocolate shell, whereas the Nogger Black substitutes toffee in lieu of the nougat center and encases the bar in a salty, black liquorice outer shell rather than chocolate; hence the name Nogger Black. Nogger Black has a logotype that looks like graffiti. Petronella Warg, GB Glace's information officer, reported that the first Nogger ice cream bar had been marketed since 1979, its name derived from the nougat filling.\n\nThe criticism was mainly aimed at an advert where the slogan \"Nogger + liquorice = true\" (a Swedish equivalent to \"Nogger ♥ liquorice\") was written in white chalk on asphalt. Stig Wallin - chairman of the centre - misread the slogan as \"Nigger + liquorice\" and said \"It's impossible not to see this as an allusion to racism\". The centre urged for a boycott of the company if they did not withdraw the campaign. \"Slate\" writer Timothy Noah also criticized the product.\n\n"}

He is best known for his self-penned hit song \"Bad Day\" (2005), which spent five weeks atop the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nPowter grew up in Vernon, in the Okanagan-Shuswap region of British Columbia, alongside Tyrone and Susan Powter. As a child, Powter played the violin at the age of 4. He changed to piano at 10 years old after a group of children bullied him and destroyed his violin. Suffering from dyslexia, Powter had trouble in university reading music, and dropped out at the age of 20 in order to pursue his own musical career, learning all songs by ear and recording new melodies that he created. He started writing songs when he was 13 years old.\n\nPowter met producer Jeff Dawson in 1997 and released his debut studio album, \"I'm Your Betty\", on June 21, 2000. The album, limited to a very small print, contains ten songs, two of which—\"More Than I\" and \"Negative Fashion\"—were both featured on the television show \"Higher Ground\" in the episode \"Wherefore Art Thou\".\n\nPowter's first single, \"Bad Day\", was first released in Europe in mid-2005, in advance of his second album, \"Daniel Powter\". Warner Bros. Records submitted the single for commercials, and it was subsequently chosen by Coca-Cola as the theme song for an ad campaign in Europe. The song achieved heavy airplay in most European countries, peaking at number three on the overall European airplay chart. It reached number one on national airplay in Germany, number one on the singles charts in the Republic of Ireland and Italy, number two in the United Kingdom—where it stayed in the top ten for thirteen weeks—and number three in Australia.\n\nIn the United States, \"Bad Day\" was used extensively on the television series \"American Idol\" in its fifth season. Powter sang the song live at the end of the final show of that season on May 23, 2006. The song reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, Adult Top 40 and Adult Contemporary charts, making Powter the first solo Canadian male artist to top the Hot 100 since Bryan Adams in 1995 (with \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\"). The song also reached number one in Powter's homeland, Canada.\n\nOn May 31, 2005, Powter released his first extended play known as \"Free Loop.\"\n\nOn July 2, 2005, Powter performed at the Berlin installment of Live 8, a simultaneous group of concerts in nine countries intended to raise awareness of poverty in Africa and put pressure on world leaders for aid.\n\n\"Bad Day\" came in fifth in the British Record of the Year 2005. In 2006, Powter won in the New Artist of the Year category at the Canadian Juno Awards, and was nominated for Best International Breakthrough Act at the BRIT Awards. \"Bad Day\" was nominated at the 2006 \"Billboard\" Music Awards for Hot 100 Single of the Year, and was named \"Billboard\" magazine's song of the year in 2006. At the 2007 Grammy Awards, Powter received a Best Male Pop Vocal Performance nomination for the song.\n\nThe subsequent singles from \"Daniel Powter\" – \"Jimmy Gets High\", \"Free Loop\", and \"Lie to Me\" – were released in different parts of the world, each failing to match the success of \"Bad Day\". \"Free Loop\" was deemed chart ineligible in the UK (as the release included a version of \"Bad Day\" as a B-side whilst \"Bad Day\" was still in the chart, hence breaking chart rules) and failed to chart in the U.S., though it reached the top forty on the Adult Contemporary chart. Following the release of \"Lie to Me\", \"Jimmy Gets High\" was to be the fourth single from the album in the UK, but its release was cancelled. A new track called \"Love You Lately\" was released as the next U.S. single, preceding a re-release of the album \"Daniel Powter\" that was also cancelled. Powter was never able to have another major hit after \"Bad Day\" and never cracked the U.S. Hot 100 again.\n\nIn March 2008, a song by Japanese singer Haru featuring Powter, \"Find My Way\", was released. In September, Powter released his third album, \"Under the Radar\". This was the same year in which he embarked on the Wolfbaggin' Tour, joining the likes of Alphabeat and Lil Chris.\n\nPowter also performed piano on tracks for what was scheduled to be Marcy Playground frontman John Wozniak's solo album, \"Leaving Wonderland...in a fit of rage\", but the album was released under the band's name. Powter was still given credit for his contributions to the song \"Gin and Money\".\n\nOn March 16, 2009, Powter performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival then in December 2009, Powter was named as the decade's top One-Hit Wonder by \"Billboard\". The magazine describes one-hit wonders as acts whose second hit did not reach the top 25; they only included acts from 2000 to 2007. Powter's notoriety is unmistakable, since \"Bad Day\" is his only Hot 100 hit.\n\nOn January 1, 2010, he performed \"O Canada\" at the NHL Winter Classic. In that same year, he released his greatest hits album, \"Best of Me\", and with it, recorded three new songs and a new version of the title track to go along with 'Bad Day', 'Jimmy Gets High', 'Next Plane Home' and his other singles. Only one was released as a single: 'Lose To Win', on November 10, 2010.\n\nOn December 1, 2010, Powter made a tribute to English singer and songwriter John Lennon with his cover version of Happy Xmas (War Is Over). This single was released in Europe, the UK and Japan.\n\nPowter again failed to re-capture the success of \"Bad Day.\" In 2011, he took a hiatus.\n\nOn April 10, 2012, Powter's new single \"Cupid\" was released to US and Canadian iTunes stores. Powter's latest album, \"Turn on the Lights\", was released on July 2012.\n\nOn June 13, 2012, Powter also made a tribute to L'Arc-en-Ciel with his variation of the song Stay Away.\n\nOn September 10, 2012, he released \"Crazy All My Life\".\n\nOn December 5, 2012, Powter was featured in a song with Japanese singer May J. titled \"Back To Your Heart\". On the 18 he released the single \"Christmas Cupid\", which is a Christmas version of his song \"Cupid\".\n\nOn June 5, Powter announced on Twitter that he was working on a new album with Jeff Dawson, who co-produced most of his songs in the past, and John Fields, who produced \"Crazy All My Life\". He also said: \"I'm writing like I did during the first record. I'm not focusing on singles. Otherwise I would try too hard and end up with garbage sort of like Bad Day. I never thought in my wildest dreams that it was a single. I think that's what writing from your heart is. Just like anything else. When you try too hard, it really isn't worthy of anything... So I stay open and just let the songs write themselves.\"\n\nOn July 15, 2013, Powter performed at the National Association of Drug Court Professionals performing \"Bad Day\" and \"Whole World Around.\" Matthew Perry also attended the event.\n\nOn August 9, 2013, he performed at the Festival of Friends.\n\nOn September 5, 2013, Powter later released 4 new songs as bonus tracks for his album \"Turn on the Lights\" called Ur My Radio, Doesn't Matter, Cheers To Us and Goodbye.\n\nOn November 27, 2016, Powter performed at The 39th Jazz Goes To Campus Festival performing Bad Day.\n\nOn January 6, 2017, Powter released a new single called \"Delicious.\" The music video has been uploaded to his official YouTube channel on March 14, 2017.\n\nOn December 10, 2017, Powter performed at the President's Star Charity event in Singapore singing Bad Day and joined Sandra Riley Tang in a duet with her song \"Save Myself.\"\n\nOn April 6, 2018, Powter released a new single called \"Perfect For Me.\". This single is Powter's third one to not feature a music video. On April 13, he released his fourth extended play known as \"Daniel Powter\". There are 4 songs in this album: a remastered remix of Bad Day, Tell Them Who You Are in an acoustic version, his 2017 single \"Delicious\" and his 2018 single \"Perfect For Me.\"\n\nOn September 21, 2018, Powter released a single known as \"Do You Wanna Get Lucky\" followed by a single called \"Survivor\" released on October 26, and an album called \"Giants\" released on December 14. Songs in the album include \"Perfect For Me\", \"Survivor\", \"Delicious\", rerecordings of \"Bad Day\", \"Free Loop\" and \"Tell Them Who You Are\" (from the EP). A remixed version of \"Do You Wanna Get Lucky\" is also included known as the Holiday version.\n\nPowter currently lives in Los Angeles and has three children. He is divorced.\n\nPowter disclosed in July 2013 that he was sexually abused by a female babysitter for three years starting from age 7 and turned to drugs and alcohol to get over his guilt and shame. He said in an interview, \"I thought that (addiction) was my problem. But it wasn’t. That was my solution. It wasn't until I started digging in, taking a look at myself, saying I gotta work on some stuff (that) I don’t want to look at (that I figured it out). My parents didn't know and I was too scared to tell them.\"\n\n"}

Although the words \"maze\" and \"labyrinth\" are synonymous with each other, this game and the solitaire game of Labyrinth should not be confused with each other because they are different in the manner of game play and dealing. In fact, this game is more akin to another solitaire game, Gaps, though less mechanical.\n\nFirst, all 52 cards are laid out into a 6 x 9 grid, where the first two rows have 8 cards instead of 9. Then, the Kings are moved and discarded from play. This leaves six gaps, four left behind by the Kings and the two spaces formed on the first two rows.\n\nThe rule of the game are as follows:\n\nThe game is won when all 48 cards are arranged in four suit sequences from Ace to Queen with an Ace as the first card on the first row and a Queen as the last card of the sixth row; it does not matter where the gaps end up when this is achieved.\n"}

{"id": "1920481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920481", "title": "Carl Ludwig", "text": "Carl Ludwig\n\nCarl Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig (; 29 December 1816 – 23 April 1895) was a German physician and physiologist. His work as both a researcher and teacher had a major influence on the understanding, methods and apparatus used in almost all branches of physiology.\n\nIn 1842 Ludwig became a professor of physiology and in 1846 of comparative anatomy. From professorships in Zurich and Vienna he went in 1865 to the University of Leipzig and developed there the Physiological Institute, designated today after him: Carl Ludwig Institute of Physiology. Ludwig researched several topics such as the physiology of blood pressure, urinary excretion, and anesthesia. He received the Copley Medal in 1884 for his research. In 1869, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He is credited for inventing the stromuhr.\n\nSince 1932 the Carl Ludwig Honorary Medal is awarded by the German Society for Cardiology to outstanding investigators in the area of cardiovascular research.\n\nLudwig was born at Witzenhausen, near Kassel, and studied medicine at Erlangen and Marburg, taking his doctor's degree at Marburg in 1839. He made Marburg his home for the next ten years, studying and teaching anatomy and physiology, first as prosector to FL Fick (1841), then as privat-docent (1842), and finally as extraordinary professor (1846). In 1849 he was chosen professor of anatomy and physiology at Zurich, and 6 years afterwards he went to Vienna as professor in the school for military surgeons.\n\nIn 1865 Ludwig was appointed to the newly created chair of physiology at Leipzig, and continued there until his death on 23 April 1895.\n\nLudwig's name is prominent in the history of physiology, and he had a large share in bringing about the change in the method of that science that took place in the middle of the 19th century. With his friends Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz, Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke, and Emil du Bois-Reymond, whom he met for the first time in Berlin in 1847, he rejected the assumption that the phenomena of living animals depend on special biological laws and vital forces different from those that operate in the domain of inorganic nature; and he sought to explain them by reference to the same laws as are applicable in the case of physical and chemical phenomena.\n\nThis point of view was expressed in Ludwig's celebrated \"Text-book of Human Physiology\" (1852–1856), but it is as evident in his earliest paper (1842) on the process of urinary secretion as in all his subsequent work. Ludwig exercised enormous influence on the progress of physiology, not only by the discoveries he made, but also by the new methods and apparatus he introduced to its service. Thus in regard to secretion, he showed that secretory glands, such as the submaxillary, are more than mere filters, and that their secretory action is attended by chemical and thermal changes both in themselves and in the blood passing through them.\n\nLudwig demonstrated the existence of a new class of secretory nerves that control this action, and by showing that if the nerves are appropriately stimulated the salivary glands continue to secrete, even though the animal be decapitated, he initiated the method of experimenting with excised organs. He devised the kymograph as a means of obtaining a written record of the variations in the pressure of the blood in the blood vessels; and this apparatus not only conducted him to many important conclusions respecting the mechanics of the circulation, but afforded the first instance of the use of the graphic method in physiological inquiries. For researches on blood gases, he designed the mercurial blood-pump that, with various modifications, has come into extensive use. He used it for many investigations into gases of the lymph, the gaseous interchanges in living muscle, the significance of oxidized material in the blood, etc.\n\nThere is indeed scarcely any branch of physiology, except the physiology of the senses, to which Ludwig did not make important contributions. He was also a great power as a teacher and the founder of a school. Under him the Physiological Institute at Leipzig became an organized center of physiological research, whence issued a steady stream of original work; and though the papers containing the results usually bore the name of his pupils only, every investigation was inspired by him and carried out under his personal direction. Thus his pupils gained a practical acquaintance with his methods and ways of thought, and, coming from all parts of Europe, they returned to their own countries to spread and extend his doctrines. Possessed himself of extraordinary manipulative skill, he abhorred rough and clumsy work, and he insisted that experiments on animals should be planned and prepared with the utmost care, not only to avoid the infliction of pain (which was also guarded against by the use of an anesthetic), but to ensure that the deductions drawn from them should have their full scientific value.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1920495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920495", "title": "Drowned Ammet", "text": "Drowned Ammet\n\nDrowned Ammet is a fantasy novel for young adults by British author Diana Wynne Jones. It is the second book in the series \"Dalemark Quartet\".\n\nThe book begins with the birth of Alhammit Alhammitson, or Mitt, in South Dalemark, near a seaport called Holand. When Mitt is a young child, his family are evicted from their farm when the rent is doubled by Earl Hadd, the cruel and tyrannical ruler of South Dalemark. The entire family is forced to move to an unpleasant tenement in the city of Holand, where Mitt's father joins the Free Holanders, a resistance against Earl Hadd. However, after a raid on a warehouse which goes fatally wrong, Mitt's father disappears, most likely killed by the soldiers.\n\nMitt and his mother Milda are convinced that three of the elder Free Holanders, Siriol, Dideo and Ham, betrayed the younger members to the Earls soldiers because they were scared of the consequences of raiding the warehouse. Mitt is determined to take revenge on them for causing his father's death, and to do this, he joins the Free Holanders, hoping to bring them down from within. He ends up working on a fishing boat with Siriol out of Holand harbor. Milda, meanwhile, marries Hobin, a well-off gunsmith.\nMitt plans to take revenge on the Free Holanders by assassinating Earl Hadd with a homemade bomb during the annual Sea Festival, then letting himself be caught and, in turn, betraying the Free Holanders. Mitt's attempt fails miserably, when the Earl's youngest son, Navis, kicks away the bomb that Mitt planted at the Earl's feet, but the Earl is killed anyway by a sniper with a long-range gun, shooting from one of the many boats in the harbor.\n\nWatching the festival are Navis's children, Ynen and Hildrida (Hildy). Hildy is furious with her father, since he had allowed her to be betrothed to Lithar, Lord of the Holy Islands, whom she has never met. After the assassination, she asks the new Earl, Harl, to break off her engagement, but he refuses. To get back at them, she and Ynen decide to make it look as if they'd run away and gone for a sail on her new boat, the \"Wind's Road\".\n\nHaving been seen and recognized during the Earl's assassination, Mitt is forced to flee for his life. He hides on a magnificent boat—the very same one that Ynen and Hildy are running away on. They take the ship out of Holand harbor, with Mitt stowing away beneath deck, and when they are sufficiently far out to sea, Mitt shows himself, and demands that they take him to the North, where he can hide from the Earl's soldiers. Although the two are initially uncooperative, Mitt does his best to convince them that he is a rough, tough freedom fighter who will shoot them if he gets the chance; he partially succeeds, and Hildy and Ynen agree to take him North, if only because he has a gun, given to him by Hobin.\n\nOn the way North the three find, floating in the sea, the wheat figure of Poor Old Ammet, which was thrown in the sea during the Festival. This is considered good luck, and so they take him on board, lashing him to the prow as a figurehead. As well as this, Mitt has a small wax figure of Poor Old Ammet's consort, Libby Beer, which they attach to the stern.\n\nThat night they weather a dreadful autumn storm with the help the two demigods, Poor Old Ammet and Libby Beer. After the storm has passed, they come across a lifeboat, with one sailor aboard. After a few hours in the man's company, Mitt realizes that not only is the sailor the man who shot Earl Hadd from the harbor, he is also Mitt's own long-lost father, Al.\n\nMitt's father, who turns out to be the actual betrayer of the Freedom Fighters and a truly bad person, forces them to take him to the Holy Islands. He plans to deliver Hildy to her would-be fiancé, the Lord of the Holy Islands, the man she ran away from home to avoid marrying. Hildy is determined to stop this, but before they can do anything, they arrive in the Holy Islands.\n\nUpon being told the name of the \"Wind's Road\", the Holy Islanders say that a great one \"will come on the wind's road with a great one before him and behind.\" Hildy and Ynen are taken prisoner, but Al forces Lithar, who is a childish imbecile, to have Mitt killed. The Holy Islanders refuse to harm him, so they maroon him on the uninhabited Holy Island. Hildy, meanwhile, meets with Libby Beer herself. Libby tells her that, if she wishes to return to the Holy Islands, she must trust Mitt. Hildy reluctantly agrees.\n\nOn Holy Island, Mitt encounters the two demigods in person and learns their secret names. When invoked in dire danger, the secret names produce cataclysmic effects that explain the folk names by which the two demigods are called on Holy Islands: the Earth Shaker for Poor Old Ammet and She Who Raised the Islands for Libby Beer. Meanwhile, Hildy and Ynen are re-united with Navis, who tells them that they were lucky to escape Holand alive, as Harl had been planning to kill them.\n\nAl is taking Ynen and Navis back to Holand to be killed by Harl when Mitt arrives.

The battle was part of the Creek War.\n\nIn July 1813, Peter McQueen, a Creek Indian chief, and a large party of Red Stick warriors proceeded to Pensacola, Florida to buy munitions, with $400 and a letter from a British officer at Fort Malden. In McQueen's words, the Spanish governor gave them \"a small bag of powder for each ten towns, and five bullets to each man.\" The governor presented this as a \"friendly present, for hunting purposes\".\n\nBut Samuel Moniac, a Creek warrior, testified August 2, 1813 after the events, \"High Head told me that, when they went back with their supply, another body of men would go down for another supply of ammunition; and that ten men were to go out of town, and they calculated on 'five horse-loads for every town'.\"\n\nUnited States soldiers at Fort Mims, having heard of Peter McQueen's mission, sent a quickly organized force, led by Colonel James Caller and Captain Dixon Bailey, to intercept McQueen's party. The Americans ambushed the Red Sticks as they bedded down on the evening of July 27, 1813, on the banks of Burnt Corn Creek, in present-day southern Alabama (in what is now northern Escambia County, Alabama). It would become known as \"The Battle of Burnt Corn\" or the \"Battle of Burnt Corn Creek,\" and would be seen as a part of the broader Creek War.\n\nThe Americans scattered the Red Sticks, who fled to the nearby swamps. Flush with victory, the Americans began looting the Red Sticks' pack-horses. From the swamp, the Creeks noticed that the Americans had dropped their guard. The Creek re-grouped and launched a surprise attack of their own, which scattered the Americans.\n\n"}

The new currency was named after Inti, the Inca sun god.\n\nThe inti was introduced on 1 February 1985, replacing the sol which had suffered from high inflation. One inti was equivalent to 1,000 soles. Coins denominated in the new unit were put into circulation from May 1985 and banknotes followed in June of that year.\n\nBy 1990, the inti had itself suffered from high inflation. As an interim measure, from January to July 1991, the \"inti millón\" (I/m.) was used as a unit of account. One inti millón was equal to 1,000,000 intis and hence to one new sol. The \"nuevo sol\" (\"new sol\") was adopted on 1 July 1991, replacing the inti at an exchange rate of a million to one.

It is a common misconception that PI is too unstable to be stored; it is, in fact, commercially available. It is widely used in organic chemistry for converting alcohols to alkyl iodides. It is also a powerful reducing agent. Note that phosphorus also forms a lower iodide, PI, but the existence of PI is doubtful at room temperature.\n\nPI has essentially zero dipole moment in carbon disulfide solution, because the P-I bond has almost no dipole. The P-I bond is also weak; PI is much less stable than PBr and PCl, with a standard enthalpy of formation for PI of only −46 kJ/ mol (solid). The phosphorus atom has an NMR chemical shift of 178 ppm (downfield of HPO).\n\nPhosphorus triiodide reacts vigorously with water, producing phosphorous acid (HPO) and hydroiodic acid (HI), along with smaller amounts of phosphine and P-P compounds. Alcohols likewise form alkyl iodides, this providing the main use for PI.\n\nPI is also a powerful reducing agent and deoxygenating agent. It reduces sulfoxides to sulfides, even at −78 °C. Meanwhile, heating a 1-iodobutane solution of PI with red phosphorus causes reduction to PI.\n\nThe usual method or preparation is by the union of the elements, often by addition of iodine to a solution of white phosphorus in carbon disulfide:\n\nAlternatively, PCl may be converted to PI by the action of hydrogen iodide or certain metal iodides.\n\nPhosphorus triiodide is commonly used in the laboratory for the conversion of primary or secondary alcohols to alkyl iodides. The alcohol is frequently used as the solvent, on top of being the reactant. Often the PI is made \"in situ\" by the reaction of red phosphorus with iodine in the presence of the alcohol; for example, the conversion of methanol to give iodomethane:\n\nThese alkyl iodides are useful compounds for nucleophilic substitution reactions, and for the preparation of Grignard reagents.\n\n"}

A multiple world champion in sprint and perennial favorite at the Winter Olympics, he broke a ten-year Olympic jinx when he won a gold medal in his final race, which was the 1,000 meters in the 1994 Winter Games.\n\nDan Jansen is the youngest of nine children born to Geraldine (née Grajek) Jansen (1928–2017) a nurse, and Harry Jansen (1928–2015), who retired from the police department as a lieutenant detective. His family is Roman Catholic. He has three sisters who are nurses. Two of his four brothers are police officers and one is a firefighter. He graduated from West Allis Central High School. Inspired by his sister Jane (1960–1988), he took up speed skating while growing up. He set a junior world record in the 500-meter race at age 16, and finished 16th in the 1,000 meters and fourth in the 500 meters at the 1984 Winter Olympics.\n\nIn 1988, Jansen became the World Sprint Champion before heading to the 1988 Winter Olympics, where he was a favorite for the 500- and 1,000-meter races. In the early hours of February 14, the day of the 500-meter event, Jansen was informed that his 27-year-old sister, Mrs. Jane Marie Beres, was dying of leukemia. Jansen spoke to her on the phone but was unable to receive a response. A few hours later, Jansen was notified of his sister's death.\n\nJansen went on to compete in the 500-meter race that afternoon but fell in the first turn. Four days later in the 1,000-meter event, he began with record-breaking speed but fell again, just past the 800-meter mark. He left the 1988 Olympics with no medals but became the recipient of the U.S. Olympic Spirit Award for his valiant efforts. In the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, he finished fourth in the 500 meters and 26th in the 1,000 meters, and left the games with no medals. In 1993, Jansen set a world record in the 500-meter event and was cast as a favorite to win the gold medal in the event at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer.\n\nBetween the 1992 and 1994 Olympics, Jansen was the only skater to break 36 seconds in the 500 meters, doing so four times. In 1994, Jansen won his second World Sprint Championship title, and he arrived at the 1994 Winter Olympics for one final attempt at an Olympic medal.\n\nIn the 500-meter event, he finished eighth. In preparation for the 1,000-meter event, he was coached by Peter Mueller, who won the same event in the 1976 Winter Olympics. Jansen defied expectations and finished first, winning his first and only Olympic medal of his career, while setting a new world record in the process. He received the 1994 James E. Sullivan Award and was chosen by his fellow Olympians to bear the U.S. flag at the closing ceremony of the 1994 Winter Olympics. He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nJansen has two daughters, Jane (named after his sister) and Olivia, from his marriage to first wife Robin Wicker. After separating from his wife, he was in a relationship with Christine Rosa. His second wife, Karen Palacios, is a top golf teaching professional. He was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2004. Today, Dan Jansen is a speed skating commentator for NBC, and, from 2005 to 2007, he was the skating coach for the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League.\n\nIn memory of his sister Jane, he established the Dan Jansen Foundation with the purpose of fighting leukemia. He is an honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.\n\nOver the course of his career, Jansen set eight world records in speed skating:\n\n"}

The Treaty of Karlowitz (1699) was not an acceptable long-standing agreement for the Ottoman Empire. Twelve years after Karlowitz, the Turks began the long prospect of taking revenge for their defeat at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. First, the Turkish Grand Vizier Baltacı Mehmet's army defeated Peter the Great's Russian Army in the Russo-Turkish War (1710–1711). Thereafter, in the Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–1718), the new Grand Vizier Damat Ali re-conquered the Morea from the Venetians in 1715. As a reaction, Austria, as the guarantor of the Treaty of Karlowitz, threatened the Ottoman Empire, but in response the Ottoman Empire declared war against Austria.\n\nIn 1716, Prince Eugene of Savoy defeated the Turks at Petrovaradin. The Banat and its capital Timişoara was conquered in October 1716. The following year, after the Austrians captured Belgrade, the Turks wanted peace and in 1718 the Treaty of Passarowitz was signed. The Austrians maintained control over Belgrade and the Treaty of Passarowitz confirmed their gains in 1699, leaving the Turks with control over the south bank of the Danube river. The war led to the loss of Austrian holdings in Italy because of their support in the Balkans. It caused them to send more supplies to the Balkan front, ultimately reducing focus to their Italian territories which were facing aggression from Spain. Even though Eugene of Savoy asked for the troops to be diverted, focus was given to the Ottomans. This ultimately caused the War of the Quadruple Alliance against Spain.\n\n"}

He served as a delegate to the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1946. He was active in the civil section of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and helped establish international parliamentary groups to help set out the political, economic and social goals of NATO.\n\nRobertson was appointed Speaker of the Senate of Canada in 1953. He continued his efforts with NATO, and formed the Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association in 1954 with himself as president. He encouraged the formation of similar associations in other countries. He won the 1954 Atlantic Award for outstanding service to the NATO community for his efforts that ultimately led to the formation of the NATO International Parliamentary Association in July 1955. Senator Robertson was Chairman of the founding conference, and was elected Honorary Life President of the international association.\n\nRobertson's term as the Senate's speaker ended with the defeat of the Liberal government in the 1957 election. Robertson remained a Senator until his resignation in 1965 due to ill health. He died in Ottawa at the age of 76.\n\n"}
{"id": "1920594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920594", "title": "The Blind Boys of Alabama", "text": "The Blind Boys of Alabama\n\nThe Blind Boys of Alabama, also billed as The Five Blind Boys of Alabama and Clarence Fountain and the Blind Boys of Alabama, is an American gospel group. The group was founded in 1939 in Talladega, Alabama and has featured a changing roster of musicians over its history, the majority of whom are or were visually impaired.\n\nThe Blind Boys found mainstream success following their appearance in the 1983 Obie Award-winning musical \"The Gospel at Colonus\". Since then, the group has toured internationally and has performed and recorded with such artists as Prince, Lou Reed, Peter Gabriel, Bonnie Raitt, Ben Harper, Bon Iver and Amadou & Mariam. The group's cover of the Tom Waits song \"Way Down in the Hole\" was used as the theme song for the first season of the HBO series \"The Wire\".\n\nThe Blind Boys have won five Grammy Awards in addition to being presented with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009. They were endowed with a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1994, they were inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2003 and they were inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame in 2010. The group was also invited to the White House during the Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations.\n\nGroup member Ricky McKinnie said in a 2011 interview with the magazine \"Mother Jones\": \"Our disability doesn't have to be a handicap. It's not about what you \"can't\" do. It's about what you do. And what we do is sing good gospel music.\"\n\nThe Blind Boys of Alabama first sang together in the school chorus in 1939 at the Alabama Institute for the Negro Deaf and Blind in Talladega, Alabama. The founding members were Clarence Fountain (19292018), George Scott (19292005), Velma Bozman Traylor (19231947), Johnny Fields (19272009), Olice Thomas (b. 1926, d. unknown), and the only sighted member, J. T. Hutton (c. 19242012.)\n\nEarly influences of the Blind Boys include the Golden Gate Quartet, The Soul Stirrers and The Heavenly Gospel Singers. While the boys were not allowed to sing black gospel music at their school (which was run by an all-white faculty) they were able to hear it on the radio.\n\nThe earliest version of the group was known as The Happy Land Jubilee Singers and their first performances were for World War II soldiers at nearby encampments, where the boys sung for pocket change. The group's first professional performance was on June 10, 1944 during a broadcast from radio station WSGN (currently WAGG) in Birmingham, Alabama. The following year, the members dropped out of school and began touring the gospel circuit. In 1947 lead vocalist Traylor died in a gun accident.\n\nIn 1948, a Newark, New Jersey promoter booked the Happy Land Jubilee Singers along with a gospel act from Mississippi known as the Jackson Harmoneers, whose members were also visually impaired, and advertised the program as the \"Battle of the Blind Boys.\" The two acts soon changed their names to the Five Blind Boys of Alabama and the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi and often toured together. The Blind Boys' early sound was also influenced by the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi who were singing in the \"hard gospel\" style that was becoming popular at the time. Hard gospel often involved a shrieking and screaming style of singing and during performances some audience members reportedly would get so excited that some would have to be sent to the hospital.\n\nThe Blind Boys also made their first recordings in 1948 on the Coleman label and their first national hit was \"I Can See Everybody's Mother But Mine\" released in 1949. Their success led to a series of recordings on various record labels.\n\nReverend Paul Exkano of the King Solomon Baptist Church in New Orleans joined the group shortly after they changed their name to Five Blind Boys of Alabama and was present during the group's first recordings in 1948 and 1949, but he left the group after two years and was replaced by Percell Perkins of the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, later replaced by Joe Watson.\n\nDuring the 1950s, black gospel music was popular and the Blind Boys were one of the better known groups. Artists from pop and rock genres began to include aspects of black gospel music in their arrangements and black gospel artists such as Ray Charles and Sam Cooke began crossing over to pop and rock music. Ray Charles's manager offered the Blind Boys a big touring deal if they would cross over to other genres, but the group decided to stick to their gospel roots. They signed with Specialty Records in 1953, but left after five years after again being pressured to sing secular music.\n\nWhile the Blind Boys were selling records in the 1950s, they did not make much money. In an interview with \"Ebony\" magazine in 2003, Fountain stated that they signed contracts that took advantage of them and that they were each paid $50 per album side and the record company kept the rest. By 1953, each member made $100 per side and, as per Fountain, \"That was good money in that day. We didn't know what we were worth.\"\n\nInto the 1960s the popularity of traditional gospel music was on the decline and soul music gained favor as a new type of secular black music. At the same time, rhythm and blues and rock musicians began to incorporate traditional gospel sounds into their music. The term \"soul\" was originally used by gospel musicians in the 1950s to identify the spiritual nature of their music. By the late 1960s the term being used more commonly to describe all popular music by African Americans.\nDuring the 1960s the Blind Boys performed at benefits for Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement. They also continued to resist offers to sing more secular music. Fountain attributed their resistance to selling out to their lack of need, noting that they were happy and well-fed as they were and wanted to enjoy performing the music they sought to perform, as opposed to recording popular music solely for a paycheck.\n\nIn 1969 Fountain left the group in order to pursue a solo career. Neither the Blind Boys nor Fountain found much success into the 1970s. In 1972, guitarist Samuel Butler Jr. (son of the guitarist of the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi) joined the group. Fountain returned to the group in 1977.\n\nDuring their first 40 years, the Blind Boys had primarily played for black gospel audiences, mainly in churches and school auditoriums. The 1980s would mark the group's exposure to a wider audience.\n\nBy the early 1980s singer Clarence Fountain had taken the role as the group's frontman. It was also at this time that the group was joined by vocalist Jimmy Carter, whose first recording with the group was on their 1982 record \"I'm a Soldier in the Army of the Lord\". Carter was also a student of the Alabama Institute for the Negro Blind when the group was originally formed, but was too young to join the group when they began touring. Carter also sang with the Dixieland Blind Boys as well as the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, prior to officially joining The Blind Boys of Alabama.\n\nIn 1983 the group (billed as Clarence Fountain and The Five Blind Boys of Alabama) was cast in the theatrical production \"The Gospel at Colonus\", an African-American musical version of Sophocles's tragedy, \"Oedipus at Colonus.\" In the play, the Blind Boys collectively played the part of blinded Oedipus. The cast also included Morgan Freeman as well as members of The Soul Stirrers. \"The Gospel at Colonus\" won an Obie for best musical in 1984 and the production moved to Broadway in 1988. The play's success led to the Blind Boys' exposure to a wider mainstream audience and marked a turning point for the group.\n\nIn 1990 vocalist and percussionist Ricky McKinnie was invited by Fountain to join the Blind Boys. McKinnie had actually met the Blind Boys when he was about five years old. McKinnie's mother, Sarah McKinnie Shivers, was a singer who would often cross paths with the Blind Boys while she was on tour. McKinnie lost his sight due to glaucoma at age 23, but had been playing drums for over a decade prior.\n\nThe Blind Boys released \"Deep River\" in 1992, which was nominated for Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album at the 36th Annual Grammy Awards. The album was produced by Booker T. Jones, and featured a version of Bob Dylan's \"I Believe In You.\" In 1993 they also appeared as musical guests on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\".\n\nIn 1994, the National Endowment for the Arts awarded a National Heritage Fellowship to Clarence Fountain and the Five Blind Boys of Alabama. The award was presented to the Blind Boys by First Lady Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn 1995 the Blind Boys became the first artists to be signed to the new House of Blues gospel label, for which they recorded their first live album \"I Brought Him with Me\". The album also featured an appearances from blues singers Koko Taylor and Solomon Burke. In December 1996 the group appeared in the Christmas episode of TV series \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" titled \"Gift wrapped\". The Blind Boys continued experimenting with contemporary popular music on their 1997 release \"Holding On\", also released on the House of Blues label. The album contained elements of funk and reggae.\n\nThe Blind Boys of Alabama enjoyed even further exposure and success in the 2000s and 2010s, including collaborations with many high-profile musical artists. Their songs were being featured on soundtracks of television series, such as \"Boston Public\", \"Lost\" and \"Criminal Minds\", as well as films, such as \"Madea Goes to Jail\", \"Alpha and Omega\" and \"Hop\". The Blind Boys also made an appearance in the film \"The Fighting Temptations\" and were featured on such television series as \"60 Minutes II\" and \"The Colbert Report\" as well as on multiple episodes of \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" and \"Late Night With David Letterman\". They were also invited to perform at the White House in both 2002 during the presidency of George W. Bush for a celebration of gospel music, and in 2010 during the presidency of Barack Obama for a celebration of music from the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nIn 2001 the Blind Boys released \"Spirit of the Century\" on Peter Gabriel's Real World Records. The album won the award for Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards. The album included a version of \"I Just Want to See His Face\" by the Rolling Stones as well as a version of the song \"Amazing Grace\" arranged to the tune of \"The House of the Rising Sun\".\n\nIn 2002 they released \"Higher Ground\", an album that combines traditional gospel lyrics with the music of other artists. The title song is a rendition of the Stevie Wonder hit, but some of the lyrics were changed to make it a gospel song—for example, the line \"Lovers, keep on lovin'\" became \"Prayers, keep on prayin.\" Other songs covered on the album include \"People Get Ready\" by Curtis Mayfield, \"Spirit in the Dark\" by Aretha Franklin, \"The Cross\" by Prince and \"You and Your Folks, Me and My Folks\" by Funkadelic. The album won the Blind Boys another Grammy for Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album and also won them a GMA Dove Award for Traditional Gospel Album of the Year. The Blind Boys also performed on the steps of the Library of Congress in 2002.\n\nIn 2003 the Blind Boys released \"Go Tell It On The Mountain\". The album contains renditions of mostly Christmas related gospel songs and features guest artists Solomon Burke, Tom Waits, Michael Franti, Chrissie Hynde, Richard Thompson, Aaron Neville, Mavis Staples, Shelby Lynne, George Clinton, Robert Randolph, Me'Shell Ndegéocello and Les McCann. The album went on to win the Grammy for Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album.\n\nThe Blind Boys performed live twice with Lou Reed: In 2004 they performed together at a private concert on the floor of the UN General Assembly for the Landmine Survivors Network and in 2010 they appeared on \"Late Night With David Letterman\" and performed \"Jesus\", a song originally released by The Velvet Underground on their self-titled album.\n\nThe Blind Boys also collaborated several times with Ben Harper: Harper played guitar on the Blind Boys' albums \"Higher Ground\" and \"Spirit of the Century\". The Blind Boys again collaborated with Harper on his 2004 album \"There Will Be a Light\" and toured with him throughout Europe that year. The majority of the songs were Harper originals, but the album also included a cover of Bob Dylan and Danny O'Keefe's \"Well, Well, Well.\" \"There Will Be a Light\" also won the Grammy for Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album. The following year, Harper and the Blind Boys released \"Live at the Apollo\", a recording of their live performance from the Apollo Theater in October 2004.\n\nThe Blind Boys also released the album \"Atom Bomb\" in 2005. The album features cover versions of songs such as \"Demons\" by Fatboy Slim and Macy Gray, (a track that also featured a guest appearance by rapper Gift of Gab); Blind Faith's \"Presence of the Lord,\" featuring soul musician Billy Preston; and a cover of Norman Greenbaum's \"Spirit in the Sky,\" featuring David Hidalgo of Los Lobos and blues musician Charlie Musselwhite. The album was awarded the prize for Traditional Gospel Album of the year at the 37th GMA Dove Awards.\n\nOn March 9, 2005, at the age of 75, vocalist George Scott died of complications from diabetes and a heart condition. In 2006 vocalist Ben Moore was invited to join the group by Carter. Moore had previously performed under the name \"Bobby Purify\" as part of the R&B duo James & Bobby Purify and continued to use the name as a solo artist after the due broke up in the 1980s. In 2007 Fountain stopped touring with the group due to complications from diabetes.\n\nIn 2008 the Blind Boys released the album \"Down in New Orleans\". The album was recorded in New Orleans, which was a first for the group, and includes songs written by or made famous by New Orleans musicians along with updated gospel standards. Many tracks also feature guest musicians from the city. Tracks include a jazzy version of the popular gospel song \"Uncloudy Day\", backed by the Preservation Hall Jazz Band; blues song \"Make a Better World\" written by musician Earl King), backed by the Hot 8 Brass Band; as well as a bluesy version of \"If I Could Help Somebody\" by Mahalia Jackson with Allen Toussaint on piano. The album also won the GMA Dove award for Traditional Gospel Album of the Year.\n\nThe Blind Boys released their album \"Duets\" in 2009. Each song features a duet between the Blind Boys and another artist; some of these artists include Susan Tedeschi, Bonnie Raitt and John Hammond. Earlier that same year the group was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards and in 2010 the Blind Boys were inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame.\n\nVocalist Billy Bowers left the group in 2011 when he was injured and underwent back surgery. Bowers' role as vocalist was filled by Ricky McKinnie, who was also the groups' percussionist for many years. Bowers died July 2, 2013 of heart failure in Montgomery, Alabama at the age of 71.\n\nIn 2013 the Blind Boys released \"I'll Find a Way\", produced by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. The album also features guest appearances by Sam Amidon and Merrill Garbus of Tune-Yards. The following year the Blind Boys released \"Talkin’ Christmas!\" in collaboration with blues musician Taj Mahal.\n\nIn 2016 the Blind Boys contributed to \"\", a tribute album recorded in honor of gospel musician Blind Willie Johnson. The Blind Boys performed the song \"Mother's Children Have a Hard Time\", a performance that was nominated for Best American Roots Performance at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. The album was also nominated in the category of Best Roots Gospel Album.\n\nIn 2017 the Blind Boys released the album \"Almost Home\" on BBOA records in collaboration with Amazon Music. Fountain also rejoined the group for the album's recording. The songs on the album were written for the Blind Boys by writers including Marc Cohn, Phil Cook, John Leventhal, and Valerie June. The Blind Boys' manager, Charles Driebe, recorded interviews with the members of the group then shared them with the songwriters who wrote songs reflecting the Blind Boys' personal stories. The song \"Let My Mother Live\" from the album was nominated for Best American Roots Performance at the 2018 Grammy awards. Written by Leventhal, the song is about Carter as a young boy at the Alabama Institute and \"how scared I was, and that I wanted my mother to live until I got grown.\"\n\nOn June 3, 2018, Clarence Fountain died of complications from diabetes at the age of 88 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. His final performance with the Blind Boys of Alabama was on May 16, 2018 at the Manship Theatre in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\nSeptember 2018 saw the release of Muscle Shoals tribute album, \"Small Town Big Sound\". The Blind Boys, along with blues musician Mike Farris, performed a cover of the song \"Respect Yourself.\" The album also featured cover songs by such artists as Steven Tyler, Willie Nelson, Grace Potter, Chris Stapleton and Kid Rock.\n\nIn January 2019 the Blind Boys performed with Marc Cohn at the Katharine Hepburn Cultural Arts Center. The performance was broadcast on the PBS live music series \"The Kate\" that spring.\n\nOver the summer of 2019 the Blind Boys toured Europe with blind Afro-pop duo Amadou & Mariam. Similar to the Blind Boys, the husband-and-wife duo originally met in 1975 at the Bamako Institute for the Blind in Mali. During the tour the two groups of vocalists would provide vocal accompaniment to performances of each group's songs. They would also perform original material that they had created together, such as the songs \"Bamako to Birmingham\" and \"Two Cultures, One Beat.\"\n\nIn August of that same year the Blind Boys released a collaborative album with Marc Cohn titled \"Work To Do\". The album features Cohn and the Blind Boys performing new and older material by Cohn in addition to renditions of traditional gospel songs. Seven of the tracks are recordings from their performance on \"The Kate\" earlier that same year, including Cohn's hit \"Walking in Memphis\", as well the Blind Boys' version of “Amazing Grace” to the melody of “House Of The Rising Sun”.\n\nIn a 2019 exposé, \"The New York Times Magazine\" reported that The Blind Boys of Alabama were among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the 2008 Universal Studios fire.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1920610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920610", "title": "United States housing bubble", "text": "United States housing bubble\n\nThe United States housing bubble was a real estate bubble affecting over half of the U.S. states. Housing prices peaked in early 2006, started to decline in 2006 and 2007, and reached new lows in 2012. On December 30, 2008, the Case–Shiller home price index reported its largest price drop in its history. The credit crisis resulting from the bursting of the housing bubble is an important cause of the 2007–2009 recession in the United States.\n\nIncreased foreclosure rates in 2006–2007 among U.S. homeowners led to a crisis in August 2008 for the subprime, Alt-A, collateralized debt obligation (CDO), mortgage, credit, hedge fund, and foreign bank markets. In October 2007, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury called the bursting housing bubble \"the most significant risk to our economy\".\n\nAny collapse of the U.S. housing bubble has a direct impact not only on home valuations, but mortgage markets, home builders, real estate, home supply retail outlets, Wall Street hedge funds held by large institutional investors, and foreign banks, increasing the risk of a nationwide recession. Concerns about the impact of the collapsing housing and credit markets on the larger U.S. economy caused President George W. Bush and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke to announce a limited bailout of the U.S. housing market for homeowners who were unable to pay their mortgage debts.\n\nIn 2008 alone, the United States government allocated over $900 billion to special loans and rescues related to the U.S. housing bubble. This was shared between the public sector and the private sector. Because of the large market share of Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (both of which are government-sponsored enterprises) as well as the Federal Housing Administration, they received a substantial share of government support, even though their mortgages were more conservatively underwritten and actually performed better than those of the private sector.\n\nLand prices contributed much more to the price increases than did structures. This can be seen in the building cost index in Fig. 1. An estimate of land value for a house can be derived by subtracting the replacement value of the structure, adjusted for depreciation, from the home price. Using this methodology, Davis and Palumbo calculated land values for 46 U.S. metro areas, which can be found at the website for the Lincoln Institute for Land Policy.\n\nHousing bubbles may occur in local or global real estate markets. In their late stages, they are typically characterized by rapid increases in the valuations of real property until unsustainable levels are reached relative to incomes, price-to-rent ratios, and other economic indicators of affordability. This may be followed by decreases in home prices that result in many owners finding themselves in a position of negative equity—a mortgage debt higher than the value of the property. The underlying causes of the housing bubble are complex. Factors include tax policy (exemption of housing from capital gains), historically low interest rates, tax lending standards, failure of regulators to intervene, and speculative fever. This bubble may be related to the stock market or dot-com bubble of the 1990s. This bubble roughly coincides with the real estate bubbles of the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Spain, Poland, Hungary and South Korea.\n\nWhile bubbles may be identifiable in progress, bubbles can be definitively measured only in hindsight after a market correction, which began in 2005–2006 for the U.S. housing market. Former U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said \"We had a bubble in housing\", and also said in the wake of the subprime mortgage and credit crisis in 2007, \"I really didn't get it until very late in 2005 and 2006.\" In 2001, Alan Greenspan dropped interest rates to a low 1% in order to jump the economy after the \".com\" bubble. It was then bankers and other Wall Street firms started borrowing money due to its inexpensiveness.\n\nThe mortgage and credit crisis was caused by the inability of a large number of home owners to pay their mortgages as their low introductory-rate mortgages reverted to regular interest rates. Freddie Mac CEO Richard Syron concluded, \"We had a bubble\", and concurred with Yale economist Robert Shiller's warning that home prices appear overvalued and that the correction could last years, with trillions of dollars of home value being lost. Greenspan warned of \"large double digit declines\" in home values \"larger than most people expect\".\n\nProblems for home owners with good credit surfaced in mid-2007, causing the United States' largest mortgage lender, Countrywide Financial, to warn that a recovery in the housing sector was not expected to occur at least until 2009 because home prices were falling \"almost like never before, with the exception of the Great Depression\". The impact of booming home valuations on the U.S. economy since the 2001–2002 recession was an important factor in the recovery, because a large component of consumer spending was fueled by the related refinancing boom, which allowed people to both reduce their monthly mortgage payments with lower interest rates and withdraw equity from their homes as their value increased.\n\nAlthough an economic bubble is difficult to identify except in hindsight, numerous economic and cultural factors led several economists (especially in late 2004 and early 2005) to argue that a housing bubble existed in the U.S. Dean Baker identified the bubble in August 2002, thereafter repeatedly warning of its nature and depth, and the political reasons it was being ignored. Prior to that, Robert Prechter wrote about it extensively as did Professor Shiller in his original publication of \"Irrational Exuberance\" in the year 2000.\n\nThe burst of the housing bubble was predicted by a handful of political and economic analysts, such as Jeffery Robert Hunn in a March 3, 2003, editorial. Hunn wrote:\n\nMany contested any suggestion that there could be a housing bubble, particularly at its peak from 2004 to 2006, with some rejecting the \"house bubble\" label in 2008. Claims that there was no warning of the crisis were further repudiated in an August 2008 article in \"The New York Times\", which reported that in mid-2004 Richard F. Syron, the CEO of Freddie Mac, received a memo from David Andrukonis, the company's former chief risk officer, warning him that Freddie Mac was financing risk-laden loans that threatened Freddie Mac's financial stability. In his memo, Mr. Andrukonis wrote that these loans \"would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country\". The article revealed that more than two-dozen high-ranking executives said that Mr. Syron had simply decided to ignore the warnings.\n\nOther cautions came as early as 2001, when the late Federal Reserve governor Edward Gramlich warned of the risks posed by subprime mortgages. In September 2003, at a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, Congressman Ron Paul identified the housing bubble and foretold the difficulties it would cause: \"Like all artificially-created bubbles, the boom in housing prices cannot last forever. When housing prices fall, homeowners will experience difficulty as their equity is wiped out. Furthermore, the holders of the mortgage debt will also have a loss.\" Reuters reported in October 2007 that a Merrill Lynch analyst too had warned in 2006 that companies could suffer from their subprime investments.\n\nThe \"Economist\" magazine stated, \"The worldwide rise in house prices is the biggest bubble in history\", so any explanation needs to consider its global causes as well as those specific to the United States. The then Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said in mid-2005 that \"at a minimum, there's a little 'froth' (in the U.S. housing market) ... it's hard not to see that there are a lot of local bubbles\"; Greenspan admitted in 2007 that \"froth\" \"was a euphemism for a bubble\". In early 2006, President Bush said of the U.S. housing boom: \"If houses get too expensive, people will stop buying them ... Economies should cycle\".\n\nThroughout the bubble period there was little if any mention of the fact that housing in many areas was (and still is) selling for well above replacement cost.\n\nOn the basis of 2006 market data that were indicating a marked decline, including lower sales, rising inventories, falling median prices and increased foreclosure rates, some economists have concluded that the correction in the U.S. housing market began in 2006. A May 2006 \"Fortune\" magazine report on the US housing bubble states: \"The great housing bubble has finally started to deflate ... In many once-sizzling markets around the country, accounts of dropping list prices have replaced tales of waiting lists for unbuilt condos and bidding wars over humdrum three-bedroom colonials.\"\n\nThe chief economist of Freddie Mac and the director of Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS) denied the existence of a national housing bubble and expressed doubt that any significant decline in home prices was possible, citing consistently rising prices since the Great Depression, an anticipated increased demand from the Baby Boom generation, and healthy levels of employment. However, some have suggested that the funding received by JCHS from the real estate industry may have affected their judgment. David Lereah, former chief economist of the National Association of Realtors (NAR), distributed \"Anti-Bubble Reports\" in August 2005 to \"respond to the irresponsible bubble accusations made by your local media and local academics\".\n\nAmong other statements, the reports stated that people \"should [not] be concerned that home prices are rising faster than family income\", that \"there is virtually no risk of a national housing price bubble based on the fundamental demand for housing and predictable economic factors\", and that \"a general slowing in the rate of price growth can be expected, but in many areas inventory shortages will persist and home prices are likely to continue to rise above historic norms\". Following reports of rapid sales declines and price depreciation in August 2006, Lereah admitted that he expected \"home prices to come down 5% nationally, more in some markets, less in others. And a few cities in Florida and California, where home prices soared to nose-bleed heights, could have 'hard landings'.\"\n\nNational home sales and prices both fell dramatically in March 2007 — the steepest plunge since the 1989 Savings and Loan crisis. According to NAR data, sales were down 13% to 482,000 from the peak of 554,000 in March 2006, and the national median price fell nearly 6% to $217,000 from a peak of $230,200 in July 2006.\n\nJohn A. Kilpatrick from Greenfield Advisors was cited by Bloomberg News on June 14, 2007, on the linkage between increased foreclosures and localized housing price declines: \"Living in an area with multiple foreclosures can result in a 10 percent to 20 percent decrease in property values\". He went on to say, \"In some cases that can wipe out the equity of homeowners or leave them owing more on their mortgage than the house is worth. The innocent houses that just happen to be sitting next to those properties are going to take a hit.\"\n\nThe US Senate Banking Committee held hearings on the housing bubble and related loan practices in 2006, titled \"The Housing Bubble and its Implications for the Economy\" and \"Calculated Risk: Assessing Non-Traditional Mortgage Products\". Following the collapse of the subprime mortgage industry in March 2007, Senator Chris Dodd, Chairman of the Banking Committee held hearings and asked executives from the top five subprime mortgage companies to testify and explain their lending practices. Dodd said that \"predatory lending\" had endangered home ownership for millions of people. In addition, Democratic senators such as Senator Charles Schumer of New York were already proposing a federal government bailout of subprime borrowers in order to save homeowners from losing their residences.\n\nHome price appreciation has been non-uniform to such an extent that some economists, including former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, have argued that United States was not experiencing a nationwide housing bubble \"per se\", but a number of local bubbles. However, in 2007 Greenspan admitted that there was in fact a bubble in the U.S. housing market, and that \"all the froth bubbles add up to an aggregate bubble\".\n\nDespite greatly relaxed lending standards and low interest rates, many regions of the country saw very little price appreciation during the \"bubble period\". Out of 20 largest metropolitan areas tracked by the S&P/Case-Shiller house price index, six (Dallas, Cleveland, Detroit, Denver, Atlanta, and Charlotte) saw less than 10% price growth in inflation-adjusted terms in 2001–2006. During the same period, seven metropolitan areas (Tampa, Miami, San Diego, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Washington, D.C.) appreciated by more than 80%.\n\nHowever, housing bubbles did not manifest themselves in each of these areas at the same time. San Diego and Los Angeles had maintained consistently high appreciation rates since late 1990s, whereas the Las Vegas and Phoenix bubbles did not develop until 2003 and 2004 respectively. It was in the East Coast, the more populated part of the country where the economic real estate turmoil was the worst.\n\nSomewhat paradoxically, as the housing bubble deflates some metropolitan areas (such as Denver and Atlanta) have been experiencing high foreclosure rates, even though they did not see much house appreciation in the first place and therefore did not appear to be contributing to the national bubble. This was also true of some cities in the Rust Belt such as Detroit and Cleveland, where weak local economies had produced little house price appreciation early in the decade but still saw declining values and increased foreclosures in 2007. As of January 2009 California, Michigan, Ohio and Florida were the states with the highest foreclosure rates.\n\nBy July 2008, year-to-date prices had declined in 24 of 25 U.S. metropolitan areas, with California and the southwest experiencing the greatest price falls. According to the reports, only Milwaukee had seen an increase in house prices after July 2007.\n\nPrior to the real estate market correction of 2006–2007, the unprecedented increase in house prices starting in 1997 produced numerous wide-ranging effects in the economy of the United States.\n\nThese trends were reversed during the real estate market correction of 2006–2007. As of August 2007, D.R. Horton's and Pulte Corp's shares had fallen to 1/3 of their respective peak levels as new residential home sales fell. Some of the cities and regions that had experienced the fastest growth during 2000–2005 began to experience high foreclosure rates. It was suggested that the weakness of the housing industry and the loss of the consumption that had been driven by the withdrawal of mortgage equity could lead to a recession, but as of mid-2007 the existence of this recession had not yet been ascertained. In March 2008, Thomson Financial reported that the \"Chicago Federal Reserve Bank's National Activity Index for February sent a signal that a recession [had] probably begun\".\n\nThe share prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac plummeted in 2008 as investors worried that they lacked sufficient capital to cover the losses on their $5 trillion portfolio of loans and loan guarantees. On June 16, 2010, it was announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange; shares now trade on the over-the-counter market.\n\nBasing their statements on historic U.S. housing valuation trends, in 2005 and 2006 many economists and business writers predicted market corrections ranging from a few percentage points to 50% or more from peak values in some markets, and although this cooling had not yet affected all areas of the U.S., some warned that it still could, and that the correction would be \"nasty\" and \"severe\". Chief economist Mark Zandi of the economic research firm Moody's Economy.com predicted a \"crash\" of double-digit depreciation in some U.S. cities by 2007–2009. In a paper he presented to a Federal Reserve Board economic symposium in August 2007, Yale University economist Robert Shiller warned, \"The examples we have of past cycles indicate that major declines in real home prices—even 50 percent declines in some places—are entirely possible going forward from today or from the not-too-distant future.\"\n\nTo better understand how the mortgage crisis played out, a 2012 report from the University of Michigan analyzed data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), which surveyed roughly 9,000 representative households in 2009 and 2011. The data seem to indicate that, while conditions are still difficult, in some ways the crisis is easing: Over the period studied, the percentage of families behind on mortgage payments fell from 2.2 to 1.9; homeowners who thought it was \"very likely or somewhat likely\" that they would fall behind on payments fell from 6% to 4.6% of families. On the other hand, family's financial liquidity has decreased: \"As of 2009, 18.5% of families had no liquid assets, and by 2011 this had grown to 23.4% of families.\"\n\nBy mid-2016, the national housing price index was \"about 1 percent shy of that 2006 bubble peak\" in nominal terms but 20% below in inflation adjusted terms.\n\nIn March 2007, the United States' subprime mortgage industry collapsed due to higher-than-expected home foreclosure rates (no verifying source), with more than 25 subprime lenders declaring bankruptcy, announcing significant losses, or putting themselves up for sale. The stock of the country's largest subprime lender, New Century Financial, plunged 84% amid Justice Department investigations, before ultimately filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 2, 2007, with liabilities exceeding $100 million.\n\nThe manager of the world's largest bond fund, PIMCO, warned in June 2007 that the subprime mortgage crisis was not an isolated event and would eventually take a toll on the economy and ultimately have an impact in the form of impaired home prices. Bill Gross, a \"most reputable financial guru\", sarcastically and ominously criticized the credit ratings of the mortgage-based CDOs now facing collapse:\n\nAAA? You were wooed, Mr. Moody's and Mr. Poor's, by the makeup, those six-inch hooker heels, and a \"tramp stamp.\" Many of these good-looking girls are not high-class assets worth 100 cents on the dollar ... [T]he point is that there are hundreds of billions of dollars of this toxic waste ... This problem [ultimately] resides in America's heartland, with millions and millions of overpriced homes.\n\nBusiness Week has featured predictions by financial analysts that the subprime mortgage market meltdown would result in earnings reductions for large Wall Street investment banks trading in mortgage-backed securities, especially Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley. The solvency of two troubled hedge funds managed by Bear Stearns was imperiled in June 2007 after Merrill Lynch sold off assets seized from the funds and three other banks closed out their positions with them. The Bear Stearns funds once had over $20 billion of assets, but lost billions of dollars on securities backed by subprime mortgages.\n\nH&R Block reported that it had made a quarterly loss of $677 million on discontinued operations, which included the subprime lender Option One, as well as writedowns, loss provisions for mortgage loans and the lower prices achievable for mortgages in the secondary market. The unit's net asset value had fallen 21% to $1.1 billion as of April 30, 2007. The head of the mortgage industry consulting firm Wakefield Co. warned, \"This is going to be a meltdown of unparalleled proportions. Billions will be lost.\" Bear Stearns pledged up to U.S. $3.2 billion in loans on June 22, 2007, to bail out one of its hedge funds that was collapsing because of bad bets on subprime mortgages.\n\nPeter Schiff, president of Euro Pacific Capital, argued that if the bonds in the Bear Stearns funds were auctioned on the open market, much weaker values would be plainly revealed. Schiff added, \"This would force other hedge funds to similarly mark down the value of their holdings. Is it any wonder that Wall street is pulling out the stops to avoid such a catastrophe? ... Their true weakness will finally reveal the abyss into which the housing market is about to plummet.\" The \"New York Times\" report connects the hedge fund crisis with lax lending standards: \"The crisis this week from the near collapse of two hedge funds managed by Bear Stearns stems directly from the slumping housing market and the fallout from loose lending practices that showered money on people with weak, or subprime, credit, leaving many of them struggling to stay in their homes.\"\n\nOn August 9, 2007, BNP Paribas announced that it could not fairly value the underlying assets in three funds because of its exposure to U.S. subprime mortgage lending markets. Faced with potentially massive (though unquantifiable) exposure, the European Central Bank (ECB) immediately stepped in to ease market worries by opening lines of €96.8 billion (U.S. $130 billion) of low-interest credit. One day after the financial panic about a credit crunch had swept through Europe, the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank conducted an \"open market operation\" to inject U.S. $38 billion in temporary reserves into the system to help overcome the ill effects of a spreading credit crunch, on top of a similar move the previous day. In order to further ease the credit crunch in the U.S. credit market, at 8:15 a.m. on August 17, 2007, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank Ben Bernanke decided to lower the discount window rate, which is the lending rate between banks and the Federal Reserve Bank, by 50 basis points to 5.75% from 6.25%. The Federal Reserve Bank stated that the recent turmoil in the U.S. financial markets had raised the risk of an economic downturn.\n\nIn the wake of the mortgage industry meltdown, Senator Chris Dodd, chairman of the Banking Committee, held hearings in March 2007 in which he asked executives from the top five subprime mortgage companies to testify and explain their lending practices. Dodd said that \"predatory lending practices\" were endangering home ownership for millions of people. In addition, Democratic senators such as Senator Charles Schumer of New York were already proposing a federal government bailout of subprime borrowers like the bailout made in the savings and loan crisis, in order to save homeowners from losing their residences. Opponents of such a proposal asserted that a government bailout of subprime borrowers was not in the best interests of the U.S. economy because it would simply set a bad precedent, create a moral hazard, and worsen the speculation problem in the housing market.\n\nLou Ranieri of Salomon Brothers, creator of the mortgage-backed securities market in the 1970s, warned of the future impact of mortgage defaults: \"This is the leading edge of the storm ... If you think this is bad, imagine what it's going to be like in the middle of the crisis.\" In his opinion, more than $100 billion of home loans were likely to default when the problems seen in the subprime industry also emerge in the prime mortgage markets.\n\nFormer Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had praised the rise of the subprime mortgage industry and the tools which it uses to assess credit-worthiness in an April 2005 speech. Because of these remarks, as well as his encouragement of the use of adjustable-rate mortgages, Greenspan has been criticized for his role in the rise of the housing bubble and the subsequent problems in the mortgage industry that triggered the economic crisis of 2008. On October 15, 2008, Anthony Faiola, Ellen Nakashima and Jill Drew wrote a lengthy article in the \"Washington Post\" titled, \"What Went Wrong\". In their investigation, the authors claim that Greenspan vehemently opposed any regulation of financial instruments known as derivatives. They further claim that Greenspan actively sought to undermine the office of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, specifically under the leadership of Brooksley E. Born, when the Commission sought to initiate the regulation of derivatives. Ultimately, it was the collapse of a specific kind of derivative, the mortgage-backed security, that triggered the economic crisis of 2008. Concerning the subprime mortgage mess, Greenspan later admitted that \"I really didn't get it until very late in 2005 and 2006.\"\n\nOn September 13, 2007, the British bank Northern Rock applied to the Bank of England for emergency funds because of liquidity problems related to the subprime crisis. This precipitated a bank run at Northern Rock branches across the UK by concerned customers who took out \"an estimated £2bn withdrawn in just three days\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1920669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920669", "title": "Jakob Ayrer", "text": "Jakob Ayrer\n\nJakob Ayrer (c. 1543 – March 26, 1605 or in 1625) was a German playwright and author of \"Fastnachtsspiele\" (carnival or Shrovetide plays).\n\nLittle is known of Ayrer's living circumstances. He lived as an ironmonger in Nuremberg, probably studying theology and law in Bamberg before returning in 1593 to Nuremberg, where he was Imperial notary and legal prosecutor.\n\nAyrer was the last significant composer of \"Fastnachtsspiele\" and a very prolific author: of his 106 plays, sixty-nine survive. He took his material from Greek mythology, Roman fables and German chapbooks and stories; he also translated plays of Shakespeare. Ayrer died in 1605 in his birth city of Nuremberg. \"Opus Theatricum\", a six-volume selection of his plays, \"Fastnachtsspiele\" and farces, appeared in 1618.\n\nAs a dramatist, Ayrer is virtually the successor of Hans Sachs, but he came under the influence of the so-called \"Englische Komodianten\", that is, troupes of English actors, who, at the close of the 16th century and during the 17th, repeatedly visited the Continent, bringing with them the repertory of the Elizabethan theatre. From those actors Ayrer learned how to enliven his dramas with sensational incidents and spectacular effects, and from them he borrowed the character of the clown. Influence may have operated in the other direction as well; \"Comedia von der schönen Sidea\" (ca. 1600; “Comedy of the Beautiful Sidea”) is often cited as the plot model used by William Shakespeare in \"The Tempest\". Ayrer's plays, however, are in spite of his foreign models, hardly more dramatic, in the true sense of the word, than those of Sachs, and they are inferior to the latter in poetic qualities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1920672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920672", "title": "I Want You (She's So Heavy)", "text": "I Want You (She's So Heavy)\n\n\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by John Lennon (credited to Lennon–McCartney). The song closes side one on their 1969 album \"Abbey Road\".\nThe song is an unusual Beatles composition for a variety of reasons, namely its length (nearly eight minutes), minimal lyrics, a three-minute descent through repeated guitar chords over a rising background of synthesized white noise, and an abrupt ending. It was the first song recorded for the \"Abbey Road\" album but one of the last songs to be finished, on 20 August 1969, the last time all four Beatles were together in the studio.\n\nLennon wrote the song about his love for Yoko Ono. It begins in time, with an arpeggio guitar theme in D minor, progressing through E and B before cadencing on an A augmented chord. In this chord sequence, the F note is a drone. The bass and lead guitar ascend and descend with a riff derived from the D minor scale. As the last chord fades, a verse begins in time, based on the A and D blues scales, with Lennon singing \"\"I want you / I want you so bad ...\"\" The two blues verses alternate, before the reappearance of the E chord, and McCartney playing a notably aggressive bass riff. This would function, throughout the song, as a transition to the main theme. The main theme repeats with Lennon singing \"\"She's so heavy\"\", with a long sustain on the last word. The second set of verses are rendered instrumentally with lead guitar. Another repeat of the \"She's So Heavy\" theme (this time featuring harmonies) is followed by Lennon singing a livelier repeat of the \"I Want You\" verse. During the next E transition, Lennon lets loose a primal scream of \"\"Yeah\"\", until his voice breaks. The song's coda consists of a three-minute repetition of the \"She's So Heavy\" theme, with the arpeggios double tracked, intensifying with \"white noise\" fading in as the theme continues; this consists of multi-tracked guitars from Lennon and Harrison, Moog white-noise from Lennon, and drums and bass from Starr and McCartney respectively. In the middle of the 15th repetition of the theme, the song abruptly ends.\n\nThe song was rehearsed several times during the \"Get Back/Let It Be\" sessions; the basic track and Lennon's guide vocal (which is used in the master) were recorded at Trident Studios on 22 February 1969, shortly after shooting for the \"Let It Be\" film ended. Lennon played the lead guitar, as George Harrison stated:\n\nLennon and Harrison overdubbed multi-tracked heavy guitars on 18 April 1969. Billy Preston's Hammond organ and Ringo Starr's congas were added on 20 April 1969. \"I Want You\" received the \"She's So Heavy\" vocals on 11 August, and thus the title became \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\". \"'She's So Heavy' was about Yoko,\" Lennon told \"Rolling Stone\". \"When you're drowning, you don't say, 'I would be incredibly pleased if someone would have the foresight to notice me drowning and come and help me.' You just scream.\"\n\nThree takes from 22 February were edited into a master (second generation), which was overdubbed, mixed down on 18 April (third generation), and overdubbed on 18 April, 20 April, 8 August and 11 August. Different overdubs were made to the second generation tape on 8 August. The mix is the third generation for 4:37 and then the second generation tape, which has white noise produced by the Moog synthesizer played by Lennon and additional drums added on 8 August. The final overdub session for \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\", which included the final mixing and editing, was the last time all four Beatles worked in the studio together.\n\nThe final master lasted 8:04, but Lennon decided on a surprise ending. During the final edit with the guitars, drums and white noise climaxing endlessly, he told recording engineer Geoff Emerick to \"cut it right there\" at the 7:44 mark, bringing the song (and side one of \"Abbey Road\") to an abrupt end. \n\nOn the Beatles' remix album \"Love\", the three-minute guitar coda from \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" is attached to \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\", and snippets of that song and \"Helter Skelter\" are mixed in with the repeated guitar riff. The abrupt ending of the original is retained, but it cuts to wind-like white noise, not to silence as on the original. The mix also included the organ solo and the guitar solo from the trident studio outtake.\n\nJosh Hart and Damian Fanelli, writing for \"Guitar World\", placed the song 34th in their list of the 50 Heaviest Songs Before Black Sabbath, and called the song a \"bluesy rocker\" that \"might have inadvertently started doom metal.\" Similarly, Jo Kendall of \"Classic Rock\" magazine commented that the song pre-dated \"Black Sabbath's creation of doom rock by several months\" and noted the \"Santana-like Latin blues section\" in the song. James Manning, of \"Time Out London\", describes the song as the foundation for stoner rock.\n\nPersonnel per Ian MacDonald.\n"}
{"id": "1920674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920674", "title": "KUKA", "text": "KUKA\n\nKUKA is a German manufacturer of industrial robots and solutions for factory automation. It is owned by the Chinese company Midea Group.\n\nThe KUKA Robotics Corporation has 25 subsidiaries worldwide, mostly sales and service subsidiaries, including in the United States, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Russia and most European countries. The company name, KUKA, is an acronym for \"Keller und Knappich Augsburg\".\n\nKUKA Systems GmbH, a division of KUKA, is an international supplier of engineering services and flexible automated manufacturing solutions with around 3,900 employees in twelve countries globally. KUKA Systems’ plants/equipments are being used by various automotive manufacturers such as BMW, GM, Chrysler, Ford, Volvo, Volkswagen, Daimler AG, Valmet Automotive as well as manufacturers from other industrial sectors such as Airbus, Astrium, Siemens and others. The range includes products and services for task automation in the industrial processing of metallic and non-metallic materials for various industries including automotive, energy, aerospace, rail vehicles, and agricultural machinery.\n\nThe company was founded in 1898 in Augsburg, Germany, by Johann Josef Keller and Jacob Knappich. The acetylene factory \"Augsburg\" was founded in 1898 by Johann Josef Keller and Jakob Knappich for the production of low-cost domestic and municipal lighting, household appliances and automobile headlights. In 1905, the production was extended to the innovative autonomous welding equipment. After the First World War, Keller and Knappich resumed production of safety-, manual- and power-winches and began the manufacturing of large containers. As a result, the \"Bayerische Kesselwagen GmbH\" was formed in 1922. The new company was responsible for the development and production of superstructures for municipal vehicles (street cleaning machines, sewage trucks, garbage trucks). \nIn 1927, this business division presented the first large garbage truck. The name \"KUKA\" came into being in the same year through the company’s name at that time “Keller und Knappich Augsburg”.\n\nKeller & Knappich GmbH merged with part of Industrie-Werke Karlsruhe AG to become Industrie-Werke Karlsruhe Augsburg Aktiengesellschaft, eventually KUKA (Keller und Knappich Augsburg) for short.\n\nThe development and manufacture of spot welding equipment began in 1936. Three years later, KUKA already had more than 1,000 employees. After the major destruction of the company during the Second World War in 1945, KUKA started manufacturing welding machines and other small appliances again. With new products such as the double-cylinder circular knitting machine and the portable typewriter \"Princess\", KUKA introduced new industrial fields and gained independence from the supply sector. \n\nIn 1956, KUKA manufactured the first automatic welding system for refrigerators and washing machines and supplied the first multi-spot welding line to Volkswagen AG. Ten years later, the first friction welding machine went into production.\n\nIn 1967, the arc welding method was applied for the first time at KUKA. In 1971, the delivery of the first robotic welding system for the S-Class took place. A year later, the magnetic arc-welding machine came to the market.\n\nIn 1973, KUKA created its own industrial robot FAMULUS. At that time, the company belonged to the Quandt group. \n\nIn 1978, beginning with the IR 601/60, robot production went into mass-production.\n\nIn 1980, the Quandt family withdrew and a publicly owned firm was established. In 1981, KUKA’s main activities were grouped into three independent companies: the \"KUKA Schweissanlagen und Roboter GmbH\", the \"KUKA Umwelttechnik GmbH\" and the \"KUKA Wehrtechnik GmbH\", which was re-sold to \"Rheinmetall\" in 1999. Towards the end of 1982, the \"LSW Maschinenfabrik GmbH, Bremen\" became a subsidiary of KUKA.\n\nIn 1993, the first laser-roof-seam welding systems were manufactured. These welding systems were then further expanded to adhesive bonding and sealing technologies in the following year. Around the same time, KUKA took over the tools & equipment manufacturers \"Schwarzenberg GmbH\" and expanded its business to China and the USA in the following years.\n\nIn 1995, the company was split into KUKA Robotics Corporation and KUKA Schweißanlagen (now KUKA Systems), now both subsidiaries of KUKA AG. The company is a member of the Robotics Industries Association (RIA), of the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) and the German engineering association VDMA. Today, KUKA concentrates on solutions for the automation of industrial manufacturing processes.\n\nIn 1996, \"KUKA Schweissanlagen GmbH\" became an independent company and, two years later, the market leader among European welding equipment manufacturers. The supply of the first pressing tools for automobile side-walls made of high-strength steel began in 2002. The company launched the KUKA RoboScan with remote laser welding head in 2003. Since 2006, \"KUKA Systems\" is operating its own bodyshell factory in Toledo, America and produces the bodywork for the Jeep Wrangler by Chrysler.\n\nIn the course of internationalization and expansion of business units and technologies such as reshaping, tooling, bonding, sealing, etc., \"KUKA Schweissanlagen GmbH\" became \"KUKA Systems GmbH\" in 2007. In 2010, KUKA presented a newly developed standardized cell concept for welding solutions, KUKA flexibleCUBE.\n\nIn the automation sector, KUKA Systems offers standard and customized solutions for industrial production automation; joining technologies and component handling are amongst their activity. The technologies are tested and the production processes are fully optimized prior to the development. In addition, KUKA Systems offers engineering and individual counseling, so that customized/special production solutions can be planned and optimized in co-operation with the customer.\n\nIn June 2016, Midea Group offered to buy Kuka for about €4.5 billion ($5 billion). Midea completed the takeover bid in January 2017 by taking 74.55% voting stake in the company.\n\nIn late 2017 Kuka announced that 250 employees of KUKA Systems will be terminated. The management named trouble with projects as a reason. .\n\nMost robots are finished in \"KUKA Orange\" (the official corporate color) or black.\n\nThe company is headquartered in Augsburg, Germany. As of December 2014, KUKA employed more than 13,000 workers. While previously emphasizing customers in the automotive industry, the company has since expanded to other industries. It has 5 divisions:\n\n1971 – Europe's first welding transfer line built for Daimler-Benz.\n\n1973 – The world's first industrial robot with six electromechanically driven axes, known as FAMULUS.\n\n1976 – IR 6/60 – An utterly new robot type with six electromechanically driven axes and an offset wrist.\n\n1989 – A new generation of industrial robots is developed – brushless drive motors for a low maintenance and a higher technical availability.\n\n2004 - The first Cobot KUKA LBR 3 is released. This computer controlled lightweight robot is able to interact directly with humans without safety fences and was the result of a collaboration with the German Aerospace Center institute since 1995.\n\n2007 – KUKA Titan – at the time, the biggest and strongest industrial robot with six axes, entered into the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\n2010 – As the only robot family, the robot series KR QUANTEC completely covers the load range of 90 up to 300 kg with a reach of up to 3100 mm for the first time.\n\n2012 – The new small robot series KR AGILUS is launched.\n\n2014 – With a video released in March, the company gained some recognition with the general public. The video supposedly teased their new robot, specialized in Table Tennis and shows a match against Timo Boll, a German professional. It is however not a real match but a commercial with heavy CGI and the video received strong criticism from the table tennis community. The video has been viewed over 10 million times on YouTube and has won numerous awards.\n\n2017 - KUKA robots are heavily featured in a music video by artist Nigel Stanford\n\nThe KUKA system software is the operating software and the heart of the entire control. In it, all basic functions are stored which are needed for the deployment of the robot system.\n\nRobots come with a control panel(the KCP, or KUKAControlPanel), also known as a teach pendant, that has a display and axis control buttons for A1-A6, as well an integrated 6D mouse, with which the robot can be moved in manual(teaching) mode. The pendant also allows the user to view and modify existing programs, as well as create new ones. To manually control the axes, an enabling switch (also called a dead man's switch) on the back of the pendant must be pressed halfway in for motion to be possible. The connection to the controller is a proprietary video interface and CAN bus for the safety interlock system and button operation.\n\nA rugged computer located in the control cabinet communicates with the robot system via the MFC, which controls the real-time servo drive electronics. Servo position feedback is transmitted to the controller through the so-called DSE-RDW/RDC connection. The DSE board is in the control cabinet, usually located on or integrated into the MFC, the RDW/RDC board in located in the base of the robot.\n\nThe software comprises two elements running simultaneously - the user interface and program storage, which is run on Windows 95 for KRC1 and early KRC2 controllers, Windows XP Embedded for KRC2 controllers, and Windows 7 Embedded for KRC4 controllers, as well as VxWin, a KUKA-modified version of the VxWorks real-time OS for program control and motion planning, which communicates to the MFC.\n\nThe systems also contain standard PC peripherals, such as a CD-ROM drive(or 3.5\" floppy on older controllers), USB ports, as well as a standard interface, either ISA or PCI/PCIe, for adding software and hardware options for industrial automation, such as Profibus, Interbus, DeviceNet and Profinet, and others.\n\nKUKA Systems supplied the TIG welding cell for the upper stage of the Ariane 5 launcher-rocket. \nTIG welding stands for tungsten inert gas welding and is a special form of arc welding and is one of the core activities of KUKA Systems. The company also provides apparatuses appliances for the construction of aircraft structural elements.\n\nBoeing, Bell and Airbus are among KUKA Systems' respective customers.\n\nThe KUKA Systems portfolio includes the spectrum of production automation of joining and assembling of vehicle body structures: from low-scale automated production facilities to highly flexible manufacturing systems; from production of individual equipments or subassemblies to the assembly of complete body structures and mechanical parts. Equipments for assembling discs and mounting systems for vehicle bodies and chassis (so-called “marriage”) or component installation are also available.\n\nBMW, GM, Chrysler, Ford, Volvo, Volkswagen and Daimler AG are among the customers in this business sector.\n\nManufacturers of rail vehicles are also among the customers of KUKA Systems e.g., for the construction of locomotives, subway wagons or in setting up of innovative and highly automated production lines for freight wagons.\n\nKUKA Systems offers solutions for every step of the photovoltaic module production - from brick-sawing to cell handling and cross-tie soldering to framing and packaging of modules.\n\nKUKA Systems represents itself in various other industrial sectors as well. A few examples out of many are the production of baby strollers or the production of white goods for BSH (Bosch und Siemens Hausgeräte GmbH).\n\n\nThe industrial robots are used in many application areas, such as material handling, loading, and unloading of machines, palletizing and depalletizing, spot and arc welding. They are used in some large companies, predominantly in the automotive industry, but also in other industries such as the aerospace industry. Specific applications include:\n\nIn 2001, KUKA formed a partnership with RoboCoaster Ltd to develop the world's first passenger-carrying industrial robot. The ride uses roller coaster-style seats attached to robotic arms and provides a roller coaster-like motion sequence through a series of programmable maneuvers. Riders themselves can also program the motions of their ride. A second generation system, the RoboCoaster G2, was deployed at Universal's Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Florida in 2010, in conjunction with Dynamic Structures. Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey's seats are mounted on robotic arms, which are in turn mounted on a track allowing the arms to travel through the attraction while performing their movements in synchronization with the ride's show elements (animated props, projection surfaces, etc.).\n\nKUKA's partnership with RoboCoaster has also seen KUKA robots appear in some Hollywood films. In the James Bond film \"Die Another Day\", in a scene depicting an ice palace in Iceland, NSA agent Jinx, played by Halle Berry, is threatened by laser-wielding robots. In the Ron Howard film \"The Da Vinci Code\", a KUKA robot hands Tom Hanks’ character Robert Langdon a container containing a cryptex.\n\nIn 2007, KUKA introduced a simulator, based on the Robocoaster. RoboCoaster Ltd does not market this product. An installation of this version is The Sum Of All Thrills ride at EPCOT in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.\n\nIn recent years, KUKA robotic arms can be found on Royal Caribbean cruise liners at their bionic bars. The user selects their desired drink or creates a custom one on a tablet interface. The robotic arms then use an array of spirits, mixers and liqueurs to accurately and precisely craft the desired cocktail.\n\n\n"}

Thus a volume element is an expression of the form\nwhere the formula_2 are the coordinates, so that the volume of any set formula_3 can be computed by\nFor example, in spherical coordinates formula_5, and so formula_6.\n\nThe notion of a volume element is not limited to three dimensions: in two dimensions it is often known as the area element, and in this setting it is useful for doing surface integrals. Under changes of coordinates, the volume element changes by the absolute value of the Jacobian determinant of the coordinate transformation (by the change of variables formula). This fact allows volume elements to be defined as a kind of measure on a manifold. On an orientable differentiable manifold, a volume element typically arises from a volume form: a top degree differential form. On a non-orientable manifold, the volume element is typically the absolute value of a (locally defined) volume form: it defines a 1-density.\n\nIn Euclidean space, the volume element is given by the product of the differentials of the Cartesian coordinates\nIn different coordinate systems of the form formula_8, the volume element changes by the Jacobian of the coordinate change:\nFor example, in spherical coordinates (mathematical convention) \nthe Jacobian is\nso that\nThis can be seen as a special case of the fact that differential forms transform through a pullback formula_13 as\n\nConsider the linear subspace of the \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space R that is spanned by a collection of linearly independent vectors\nTo find the volume element of the subspace, it is useful to know the fact from linear algebra that the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the formula_16 is the square root of the determinant of the Gramian matrix of the formula_16:\n\nAny point \"p\" in the subspace can be given coordinates formula_19 such that\nAt a point \"p\", if we form a small parallelepiped with sides formula_21, then the volume of that parallelepiped is the square root of the determinant of the Grammian matrix\nThis therefore defines the volume form in the linear subspace.\n\nOn an \"oriented\" Riemannian manifold of dimension \"n\", the volume element is a volume form equal to the Hodge dual of the unit constant function, formula_23:\nEquivalently, the volume element is precisely the Levi-Civita tensor formula_25. In coordinates,\nwhere formula_27 is the determinant of the metric tensor \"g\" written in the coordinate system.\n\nA simple example of a volume element can be explored by considering a two-dimensional surface embedded in \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space. Such a volume element is sometimes called an \"area element\". Consider a subset formula_28 and a mapping function\n\nthus defining a surface embedded in formula_30. In two dimensions, volume is just area, and a volume element gives a way to determine the area of parts of the surface. Thus a volume element is an expression of the form\n\nthat allows one to compute the area of a set \"B\" lying on the surface by computing the integral\n\nHere we will find the volume element on the surface that defines area in the usual sense. The Jacobian matrix of the mapping is\n\nwith index \"i\" running from 1 to \"n\", and \"j\" running from 1 to 2. The Euclidean metric in the \"n\"-dimensional space induces a metric formula_34 on the set \"U\", with matrix elements\n\nThe determinant of the metric is given by\n\nFor a regular surface, this determinant is non-vanishing; equivalently, the Jacobian matrix has rank 2.\n\nNow consider a change of coordinates on \"U\", given by a diffeomorphism\n\nso that the coordinates formula_38 are given in terms of formula_39 by formula_40. The Jacobian matrix of this transformation is given by\n\nIn the new coordinates, we have\n\nand so the metric transforms as\n\nwhere formula_44 is the pullback metric in the \"v\" coordinate system. The determinant is\n\nGiven the above construction, it should now be straightforward to understand how the volume element is invariant under an orientation-preserving change of coordinates. \n\nIn two dimensions, the volume is just the area. The area of a subset formula_46 is given by the integral\n\nThus, in either coordinate system, the volume element takes the same expression: the expression of the volume element is invariant under a change of coordinates.\n\nNote that there was nothing particular to two dimensions in the above presentation; the above trivially generalizes to arbitrary dimensions.\n\nFor example, consider the sphere with radius \"r\" centered at the origin in R. This can be parametrized using spherical coordinates with the map\nThen\nand the area element is\n\n"}
{"id": "1920695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920695", "title": "Thecodontosaurus", "text": "Thecodontosaurus\n\nThecodontosaurus (\"socket-tooth lizard\") is a genus of herbivorous basal sauropodomorph dinosaur that lived during the late Triassic period (Rhaetian age).\n\nIts remains are known mostly from Triassic \"fissure fillings\" in South England. \"Thecodontosaurus\" was a small bipedal animal, about 2 m (6.5 ft) long. It is one of the first dinosaurs to be discovered and is one of the oldest that existed. Many species have been named in the genus, but only the type species \"Thecodontosaurus antiquus\" is seen as valid today.\n\nIn the autumn of 1834, surgeon Henry Riley (1797–1848) and the curator of the Bristol Institution, Samuel Stutchbury, began to excavate \"saurian remains\" at the quarry of Durdham Down, at Clifton, presently a part of Bristol. In 1834 and 1835, they briefly reported on the finds. They provided their initial description in 1836, naming a new genus: \"Thecodontosaurus\". The name is derived from Greek θήκή, ', \"socket\", and οδους, ', \"tooth\", a reference to the fact that the roots of the teeth were not fused with the jaw bone, as in present lizards, but positioned in separate tooth sockets. \"Thecodontosaurus\" was the fifth dinosaur named, after \"Megalosaurus\", \"Iguanodon\", \"Streptospondylus\" and \"Hylaeosaurus\", though Riley and Stutchbury were not aware of this, the very concept of Dinosauria only being created in 1842. In 1843, in his catalogue of British fossils, John Morris provided a complete species name: \"Thecodontosaurus antiquus\". The specific epithet, \"\"antiquus\"\", means \"ancient\" in Latin.\n\nThe original type specimen or holotype of \"Thecodontosaurus\", BCM 1, a lower jaw, fell victim to heavy World War II bombings by the Germans. Many remains of this dinosaur and other material related to it were destroyed in November 1940 during the Bristol Blitz. However, most bones were salvaged: today 184 fossil bones are part of the collection of the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. Later, more remains were found near Bristol at Tytherington. Currently about 245 fragmentary specimens are known, representing numerous individuals. In 1985, Peter Galton designated another lower jaw, a right dentary, as the neotype, BCM 2. The remains had been found in chalkstone infillings, breccia deposited in fissures in older rocks. The age of these deposits was once estimated as old as the late Carnian, but recent studies indicate that they date from the Rhaetian.\n\nApart from the original type species, \"Thecodontosaurus antiquus\", Riley and Stutchbury also found some teeth of carnivorous phytosaurians that they named \"Palaeosaurus cylindrodon\" and \"P. platyodon\". In the late nineteenth century, the theory became popular that such remains belonged to carnivorous prosauropods: animals with the body of \"Thecodontosaurus\", but with slicing teeth. In 1890, Arthur Smith Woodward accordingly named a \"Thecodontosaurus platyodon,\" and in 1908 Friedrich von Huene named a \"Thecodontosaurus cylindrodon\". Though still defended by Michael Cooper in 1981, the hypothesis that such creatures existed has now been totally discredited.\n\nOn one occasion, material of \"Thecodontosaurus\" was, by mistake, described as a separate genus. In 1891, Harry Govier Seeley named \"Agrosaurus macgillivrayi\", assuming the remains had been collected in 1844 by the crew of HMS \"Fly\" on the northeast coast of Australia. It was long considered the first dinosaur found in Australia, but in 1999 it was discovered that the bones probably belonged to a lot sent by Riley and Stutchbury to the British Museum of Natural History and then mislabelled. In 1906, von Huene had already noted the close resemblance and renamed the species \"Thecodontosaurus macgillivrayi\". It is thus a junior synonym of \"Thecodontosaurus antiquus\".\n\nPresently, the only valid species is thus \"T. antiquus\".\n\n\n\"Thecodontosaurus caducus\" was named by Adam Yates in 2003 for a juvenile specimen found in Wales; in 2007 this was made the separate genus \"Pantydraco\".\n\nFrom the fragmentary remains of \"Thecodontosaurus\", most of the skeleton can be reconstructed, except for the front of the skull. \"Thecodontosaurus\" had a rather short neck supporting a fairly large skull with large eyes. Its jaws contained many small- to medium-sized, serrated, leaf-shaped teeth. This dinosaur's hands and feet each had five digits, and the hands were long and rather narrow, with an extended claw on each. This dinosaur's front limbs were much shorter than the legs, and its tail was much longer than the head, neck and body put together. On average, it was long, or 1 ft. tall, and weighed . The largest individuals had an estimated length of .\n\nIn 2000, Michael Benton noted the existence of a robust morph in the population, seen by him as a possible second species or, more likely, an instance of sexual dimorphism. Benton also indicated some unique derived traits, or autapomorphies, for the species: a long basipterygoid process on the braincase; a dentary that is short in relation to the total length of the lower jaw; an ilium that has a back end that is subquadrate instead of rounded.\n\nThe small size has been explained as an instance of insular dwarfism.\n\nRiley and Stutchbury originally saw \"Thecodontosaurus\" as a member of the Squamata, the group containing lizards and snakes. This did not change when Richard Owen coined the term Dinosauria in 1842, because Owen did not recognise \"Thecodontosaurus\" as a dinosaur; in 1865, he assigned it to the Thecodontia. It was not until 1870 that Thomas Huxley became the first person to understand that it was a dinosaur, though referring it incorrectly to the Scelidosauridae. Later, it was be placed in either the Anchisauridae or its own Thecodontosauridae.\n\nModern exact cladistic analyses have not been conclusive. Although not actually the earliest member of the group, \"Thecodontosaurus\" is sometimes placed in a very basal position among the sauropodomorph dinosaurs. It was earlier included under the Prosauropoda, but more recently it has been suggested that \"Thecodontosaurus\" and its relatives preceded the prosauropod-sauropod split. New reconstructions show that its neck is proportionally shorter than those in more advanced early sauropodomorphs.\n\n\"Thecodontosaurus\" has formed the basis of a massive public engagement exercise, the Bristol Dinosaur Project, that has run since 2000. In 2009, HLF core funded the Bristol Dinosaur Project, which allowed for the hiring of an Educational Officer and a Fossil Preparator to further develop the project. This funding resulted in three and a half years of extensive laboratory, research, and outreach work that presented the project to thousands of people all around the world.\n\n\n"}

A reluctant celebrity, her bittersweet life was famously woven of luxury, disputes and interludes of deep unhappiness.\n\nDuke's passions varied wildly. Briefly a news correspondent in the 1940s, she also played jazz piano and learned to surf competitively. At her father's estate at Hillsborough Township, New Jersey, she created one of America's largest indoor botanical displays. She was also active in preserving more than 80 historic buildings in Newport, Rhode Island.\n\nTwice divorced, Duke enjoyed a colorful private life that was seldom out of the gossip columns.\n\nHer philanthropic work in AIDS research, medicine, and child welfare continued into her old age. Her estimated $1.3 billion fortune was largely left to charity. Duke's legacy is now administered by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, dedicated to medical research, prevention of cruelty to children and animals, the performing arts, wildlife and ecology.\n\nDuke was born in New York City, the only child of tobacco and hydroelectric power tycoon James Buchanan Duke and his second wife, Nanaline Holt Inman, widow of William Patterson Inman. At his death in 1925, the elder Duke's will bequeathed the majority of his estate to his wife and daughter, along with $17 million in two separate clauses of the will, to The Duke Endowment he had created in 1924. The total value of the estate was estimated variously at $60 million to $100 million (equivalent to $ million to $ billion in ), the majority derived from J.B. Duke's holdings in the American Tobacco Company and the precursor of the Duke Power Company.\n\nDuke spent her early childhood at Duke Farms, her father's estate in Hillsborough Township, New Jersey. Due to ambiguity in James Duke's will, a lawsuit was filed in 1927 to prevent auctions and outright sales of real estate he had owned; in effect, Doris Duke successfully sued her mother and other executors to prevent the sales. One of the pieces of real estate in question was a Manhattan mansion at 1 East 78th Street which later became the home of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University.\n\nWhen she turned 18, in 1930, the tall Duke was presented to society as a debutante, at a ball at Rough Point, the family residence in Newport, Rhode Island. She received large bequests from her father's will when she turned 21, 25, and 30; she was sometimes referred to as the \"world's richest girl.\" Her mother died in 1962, leaving her jewelry and a coat.\n\nWhen Duke came of age, she used her wealth to pursue a variety of interests, including extensive world travel and the arts. During World War II, she worked in a canteen for sailors in Egypt, taking a salary of one dollar a year. She spoke French fluently. In 1945, Duke began a short-lived career as a foreign correspondent for the International News Service, reporting from different cities across the war-ravaged Europe. After the war, she moved to Paris and wrote for the magazine \"Harper's Bazaar\".\n\nWhile living in Hawaii, Duke became the first non-Hawaiian woman to take up competitive surfing under the tutelage of surfing champion and Olympic swimmer Duke Kahanamoku and his brothers. A lover of animals, in particular her dogs and pet camels, in her later years Duke became a wildlife refuge supporter.\n\nDuke's interest in horticulture led to a friendship with Pulitzer Prize-winning author and scientific farmer Louis Bromfield, who operated Malabar Farm, his country home in Lucas, Ohio in Richland County. Today, his farm is part of Malabar Farm State Park, made possible by a donation from Duke that helped purchase the property after Bromfield's death. A section of woods there is dedicated to her and bears her name.\n\nAt age 46, Duke started to create Duke Gardens, an exotic public-display garden, to honor her father James Buchanan Duke. She extended new greenhouses from the Horace Trumbauer conservatory at her home in Duke Farms, New Jersey. Each of the eleven interconnected gardens was a full-scale re-creation of a garden theme, country or period, inspired by DuPont's Longwood Gardens. She designed the architectural, artistic and botanical elements of the displays based on observations from her extensive international travels. She also labored on their installation, sometimes working 16-hour days. Display construction began in 1958.\n\nDuke had learned to play the piano at an early age and developed a lifelong appreciation of jazz and befriended jazz musicians. She also liked gospel music and sang in a gospel choir.\n\nDuke cultivated an extensive art collection, principally of Islamic and Southeast Asian art. In 2014, sixty objects from her collection (including ceramics, textiles, paintings, tile panels, and full-scale architectural elements) were displayed temporarily at the University of Michigan Museum of Art in the exhibition \"Doris Duke's Shangri La: Architecture, Landscape, and Islamic Art,\" organized by the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art. The collection is on public display at her former home in Honolulu, Hawaii, now the Museum of Islamic Art, Culture, & Design.\n\nIn 1966, Duke was behind the wheel of a rented car when it lurched forward and crushed interior designer Eduardo Tirella as he was opening the gates of Rough Point, the mansion they were restoring in Newport, Rhode Island. While it was ruled a freak accident by the police, Tirella's family sued and won $75,000 when Duke was found negligent.\n\nDuke acquired a number of homes. Her principal residence and official domicile was Duke Farms, her father's 2,700 acre (11 km²) estate in Hillsborough Township, New Jersey. Here she created Duke Gardens, a public indoor botanical display that was among the largest in America.\n\nDuke's other residences were private during her lifetime: she spent summer weekends working on her Newport Restoration Foundation projects while staying at Rough Point, the 49-room English manor-style mansion that she inherited in Newport, Rhode Island.\n\nWinters were spent at an estate she built in the 1930s and named \"Shangri La\" in Honolulu, Hawaii; and at \"Falcon Lair\" in Beverly Hills, California, once the home of Rudolph Valentino. She also maintained two apartments in Manhattan: a nine-room penthouse with a veranda at 475 Park Avenue that was later owned by journalist Cindy Adams; and another apartment near Times Square that she used exclusively as an office for the management of her financial affairs.\n\nShe purchased her own Boeing 737 jet and redecorated the interior to travel between homes and on her trips to collect art and plants. The plane included a bedroom decorated to resemble a bedroom in a real house. Doris Duke had difficulty remaining in one place, and whenever she arrived somewhere, she had the desire to go somewhere else.\n\nDuke was a hands-on homeowner, climbing a ladder to a three-story scaffolding to clean tile murals in the courtyard of Shangri La, and working side by side with her gardeners at Duke Farms.\n\nThree of Duke's residences are currently managed by subsidiaries of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and allow limited public access. Duke Farms in New Jersey is managed by the Duke Farms Foundation; a video tour of the former Duke Gardens is available. Rough Point was deeded to the Newport Restoration Foundation in 1999 and opened to the public in 2000. Tours are limited to 12 people. Shangri-La is operated by the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art; small personal tours and an online virtual tour are available.\n\nDuke married twice, the first time in 1935 to James H. R. Cromwell, the son of Eva Stotesbury and stepson of wealthy financier Edward T. Stotesbury. Cromwell, a New Deal advocate like his wife, used her fortune to finance his political career. In 1940 he served several months as U.S. Ambassador to Canada and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The couple had a daughter, Arden, who was born prematurely on July 13, 1940, in Hawaii and died on the following day. They divorced in 1943.\n\nOn September 1, 1947, while in Paris, Duke became the third wife of Porfirio Rubirosa, a diplomat from the Dominican Republic. She reportedly paid his second wife, actress Danielle Darrieux, $1 million to agree to an uncontested divorce. Because of her great wealth, Duke's marriage to Rubirosa attracted the attention of the U.S. State Department, which cautioned her against using her money to promote a political agenda. Further, there was concern that in the event of her death, a foreign government could gain too much leverage. Therefore, Rubirosa had to sign a pre-nuptial agreement; during the marriage, though, she gave Rubirosa several million dollars in gifts, including a stable of polo ponies, sports cars, a converted B-25 bomber, and, in the divorce settlement, a 17th-century house in Paris. One of Doris Duke's best friends was Brazilian socialite and \"jetsetter\" Aimée de Heeren.\n\nShe reportedly had numerous affairs, with, among others, Duke Kahanamoku, Errol Flynn, Alec Cunningham-Reid, General George S. Patton, Joe Castro and Louis Bromfield.\n\nDuke posted a bail of $5,000,000 for her friend, former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos after the latter was arrested for racketeering.\n\nIn 1992, at the age of 79, Duke had a facelift. She began trying to walk while she was still heavily medicated and fell, breaking her hip. In January 1993, she underwent surgery for a knee replacement. She was hospitalized from February 2 to April 15. She underwent a second knee surgery in July of that year.\n\nA day after returning home from this second surgery, she suffered a severe stroke. Doris Duke died at her Falcon's Lair home on October 28, 1993, at the age of 80. The cause was progressive pulmonary edema resulting in cardiac arrest, according to a spokesman.\n\nDuke was cremated 24 hours after her death and her executor, Bernard Lafferty, scattered her ashes into the Pacific Ocean as her last will specified.\n\nWhen Doris' father died, he left a fortune valued at $100 million, with the largest share going to Duke and her mother. Nanaline was a shrewd businesswoman, often compared to Hetty Green, and when she died in 1962, she left her daughter an estate then estimated to be worth $250 million.\n\nDuke also owned numerous shares in big-name companies, such as General Motors, and had a large financial team of bankers and accountants to manage her holdings (since, despite rumors, Duke had little to no interest in money matters). In addition, Duke had a collection of artwork, which was said to include works by Picasso, Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Monet, as well as her valuable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asia art and furniture. Also in Duke's collection were over 2,000 bottles of rare wine (worth over $5 million) and the extraordinary Duke collection of fine jewels. Her total net worth, including all property, was valued at $5.3 billion.\n\nDuke's first major philanthropic act was to establish Independent Aid, Inc., in 1934, when she was 21 years old, in order to manage the many requests for financial assistance addressed to her. In 1958, she established the Duke Gardens Foundation to endow the public display gardens she started to create at Duke Farms. Her Foundation intended that Duke Gardens \"reveal the interests and philanthropic aspirations of the Duke family, as well as an appreciation for other cultures and a yearning for global understanding.\". Duke Gardens were the center of a controversy over the decision by the trustees of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation to close them on May 25, 2008.\n\nIn 1968, Duke created the Newport Restoration Foundation with the goal of preserving more than eighty colonial buildings in the town. Historic properties include Rough Point, Samuel Whitehorne House, Prescott Farm, the Buloid-Perry House, the King's Arms Tavern, the Baptist Meetinghouse, and the Cotton House. Seventy-one buildings are rented to tenants. Only five function as museums. She also funded the construction of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in India, visited by the Beatles in 1968. \nDuke's extensive travels led to an interest in a variety of cultures, and during her lifetime she amassed a considerable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asian art. After her death, numerous pieces were donated to The Asian Art Museum of San Francisco and the Walters Art Museum of Baltimore.\n\nDuke did much additional philanthropic work and was a major benefactor of medical research and child welfare programs. In the late 1980s, Duke donated $2 million to Duke University to be used for AIDS research. Her foundation, Independent Aid, became the Doris Duke Foundation, which still exists as a private grant-making entity. After her death, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation was established in 1996, supporting four national grant making programs and Doris Duke's three estates, Shangri La, Rough Point, and Duke Farms.\n\nDuke was the life beneficiary of two trusts created by her father, James Buchanan Duke, in 1917 and 1924. The income from the trusts was payable to any children after her death. In 1988, at the age of 75, Duke legally adopted a woman named Chandi Heffner, then a 35-year-old Hare Krishna devotee and sister of the third wife of billionaire Nelson Peltz. Duke initially maintained that Heffner was the reincarnation of her only biological child Arden, who died soon after birth in 1940.\n\nThe two women had a falling out, and the final version of Duke's will specified that she did not wish Heffner to benefit from her father's trusts; she also negated the adoption. Despite the negation, after Duke's death, the estate's trustees settled a lawsuit brought by Heffner for $65 million.\n\nIn her final will, Duke left virtually all of her fortune to several existing and new charitable foundations. She appointed her butler, Bernard Lafferty, as executor of her estate. Lafferty appointed the U. S. Trust company as corporate co-executor. Lafferty and Duke's friend Marion Oates Charles were named as her trustees.\n\nHowever a number of lawsuits were filed against the will. At death, Duke's fortune was estimated at upwards of $1.2 billion. The best-known lawsuit was initiated by Harry Demopoulos. In an earlier will, Demopoulos had been named executor and challenged Lafferty's appointment. Demopolous argued that Lafferty and his lawyers had cajoled a sick, sedated old woman into giving him control of her estate.\n\nEven more sensational accusations were made by a nurse, Tammy Payette, who contended that Lafferty and a prominent Beverly Hills physician, Dr. Charles Kivowitz, had conspired to hasten Duke's death with morphine and Demerol. In 1996, the year Lafferty died, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office ruled there was no firm evidence of foul play.\n\nDuke University also filed suit, claiming entitlement to a larger share of the Duke assets than the $10 million provided in the will (although Duke's will also stated that any beneficiary who disputed its provisions should receive nothing).\n\nLitigation involving 40 lawyers at 10 different law firms tied up the Duke estate for nearly three years. New York courts ultimately removed Lafferty for using estate funds for his own support and US Trust for failing \"to do anything to stop him.\" The Surrogate Court of Manhattan overrode Duke's will and appointed new trustees from among those who had challenged it: Harry Demopoulos; J. Carter Brown (later also involved in overturning the will of Albert C. Barnes); Marion Oates Charles, the sole trustee from Duke's last will; James Gill, a lawyer; Nannerl O. Keohane, president of Duke University; and John J. Mack, president of Morgan Stanley. The fees for their lawsuits exceeded $10 million, and were paid by the Duke estate. These trustees now control all assets of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which Doris Duke directed should support medical research, anti-vivisectionism, prevention of cruelty to children and animals, performance arts, wildlife, and ecology.\n\nThe DDCF also controls funding for the three separate foundations created to operate Duke's former homes: the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art, Duke Farms and Newport Restoration Foundation. The trustees have progressively reduced funding for these foundations, stating that Doris Duke's own works are \"perpetuating the Duke family history of personal passions and conspicuous consumption.\" Recently, these foundations have sold some assets and have closed Duke Gardens. Christie's, New York, published a heavily illustrated catalog of over 600 pages for its auction of \"The Doris Duke Collection, sold to benefit the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation\" which was held in New York City over three days in 2004.\n\nThe last living heirs to Duke's vast Industrial Age fortune are twins Georgia Inman and Walker “Patterson” Inman III, the children of Walker Inman Jr., Duke's nephew. Their childhood has been documented as a tragedy of grotesque neglect, abuse, parental violence and addiction.\n\nSeveral biographies of Duke have been published, notably:\n\n\nSeveral films/television shows has been made about her life, including:\n\n\n\n"}

Its name is due to the area of red plumage commonly found at its throat.\n\nThe hypothetical Martinique amazon (\"\"A. martinicana\"\"), known only from old descriptions, was said to look quite similar and may have been a related or even the same species. It was said to occur one major island to the south of Dominica.\n\nThe red-necked amazon gets its name because of its orange and reddish feathers found on its lower throat.\n\nThe bird also sometimes has blue feathers on its forehead, around the eyes and its head. Although, the blue feathers verge to wither away to gray feathers at its upper breast. The rest of its body is covered in deep bottle green feathers and a wide band of yellow color runs down to the tip of its tail. The beak and feet are both grey. These birds average about 40 cm in length and can weigh between 550 and 650 g.\n\nThe red-necked amazon is only found in the Caribbean island of Dominica. It lives throughout Montane and sub-montane forests of Morne Diablotion and Northern and Central Forest Reserves and sequestered State Lands that are above 1500 ft elevation.\n\nThis species also lives at subordinate altitudes in agricultural regions and peripheral forests all the way to the northwest and northeast coasts. The Jacos primarily eat flowers, sprouts, seeds and fruits of the rainforest trees and plants, citrus and pastoral crops.\n\nWith a population of less than 400 birds, this beautiful parrot is very endangered due to its habitat destruction and hunting.\n\nThe species is highly social and flies in groups of 30 or more during the non-breeding season. Exceedingly territorial during nesting, breeding inaugurates from January to March, with fledging from May to July.\n\nRed-necked amazon pairs are loyal to each other and tend to stay at the same nesting site for many years. Other than early morning and afternoon calls, these birds are fairly quiet and difficult to detect in the wild because they are well cloaked by their fluff. They are dexterous climbing birds and are prone to migrate seasonally, provisional on food supplies.\n\nRed-necked amazons are most vigorous and animated in the early mornings from dawn to around 10 am, and again in the late afternoon after about 4 pm. During those periods they are most communicative. The cry of the red-necked amazon is rough with a high-pitched squawk and usually uses two-syllable notes.\n\nRed-necked amazon numbers have been diminishing through the 20th Century, primarily as a consequence of hunting for food and, to a lesser degree, the pet trade, and, more recently, by the clearing of forests for agriculture.\n\nLuckily, hunting and illegal trade no longer pose a serious threat, and this buoyant bird has made a notable recovery, both in range extension and overall population size, after its population size decreased to an all-time low of as few as 150 individuals in 1980.\n\nThrough substantial conservation action, this species has recovered to a far healthier 750 to 800 birds (2003 population estimates). Due to this, the species seems to have successfully survived Hurricane Maria in 2017, which devastated the entirety of Dominica; all of the captive birds were safe after the hurricane, and several wild birds were also sighted flying around the island.\n\n"}

{"id": "1920736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920736", "title": "Claisen rearrangement", "text": "Claisen rearrangement\n\nThe Claisen rearrangement is a powerful carbon–carbon bond-forming chemical reaction discovered by Rainer Ludwig Claisen. The heating of an allyl vinyl ether will initiate a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement to give a γ,δ-unsaturated carbonyl.\n\nDiscovered in 1912, the Claisen rearrangement is the first recorded example of a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. Many reviews have been written.\n\nThe Claisen rearrangement is an exothermic, concerted (bond cleavage and recombination) pericyclic reaction. Woodward–Hoffmann rules show a suprafacial, stereospecific reaction pathway. The kinetics are of the first order and the whole transformation proceeds through a highly ordered cyclic transition state and is intramolecular. Crossover experiments eliminate the possibility of the rearrangement occurring via an intermolecular reaction mechanism and are consistent with an intramolecular process.\n\nThere are substantial solvent effects observed in the Claisen rearrangement, where polar solvents tend to accelerate the reaction to a greater extent. Hydrogen-bonding solvents gave the highest rate constants. For example, ethanol/water solvent mixtures give rate constants 10-fold higher than sulfolane. Trivalent organoaluminium reagents, such as trimethylaluminium, have been shown to accelerate this reaction.\n\nThe first reported Claisen rearrangement is the [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of an allyl phenyl ether to intermediate 1, which quickly tautomerizes to an ortho-substituted phenol.\n\nMeta-substitution affects the regioselectivity of this rearrangement. For example, electron withdrawing groups (such as bromide) at the \"meta\"-position direct the rearrangement to the \"ortho\"-position (71% \"ortho\" product), while electron donating groups (such as methoxy), direct rearrangement to the \"para\"-position (69% \"para\" product). Additionally, presence of \"ortho\" substituents exclusively leads to para-substituted rearrangement products (tandem Claisen and Cope rearrangement).\n\nIf an aldehyde or carboxylic acid occupies the \"ortho\" or \"para\" positions, the allyl side-chain displaces the group, releasing it as carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide, respectively.\n\nThe Bellus–Claisen rearrangement is the reaction of allylic ethers, amines, and thioethers with ketenes to give γ,δ-unsaturated esters, amides, and thioesters. This transformation was serendipitously observed by Bellus in 1979 through their synthesis of a key intermediate of an insecticide, pyrethroid. Halogen substituted ketenes (R, R) are often used in this reaction for their high electrophilicity. Numerous reductive methods for the removal of the resulting α-haloesters, amides and thioesters have been developed. The Bellus-Claisen offers synthetic chemists a unique opportunity for ring expansion strategies.\n\nThe Eschenmoser–Claisen rearrangement proceeds by heating allylic alcohols in the presence of \"N\",\"N\"-dimethylacetamide dimethyl acetal to form a γ,δ-unsaturated amide. This was developed by Albert Eschenmoser in 1964. Eschenmoser-Claisen rearrangement was used as a key step in the total synthesis of morphine.\n\nMechanism:\n\nThe Ireland–Claisen rearrangement is the reaction of an allylic carboxylate with a strong base (such as lithium diisopropylamide) to give a γ,δ-unsaturated carboxylic acid. The rearrangement proceeds via silylketene acetal, which is formed by trapping the lithium enolate with chlorotrimethylsilane. Like the Bellus-Claisen (above), Ireland-Claisen rearrangement can take place at room temperature and above. The \"E\"- and \"Z\"-configured silylketene acetals lead to anti and syn rearranged products, respectively. There are numerous examples of enantioselective Ireland-Claisen rearrangements found in literature to include chiral boron reagents and the use of chiral auxiliaries.\nThe Johnson–Claisen rearrangement is the reaction of an allylic alcohol with an orthoester to yield a ester. Weak acids, such as propionic acid, have been used to catalyze this reaction. This rearrangement often requires high temperatures (100–200 °C) and can take anywhere from 10 to 120 hours to complete. However, microwave assisted heating in the presence of KSF-clay or propionic acid have demonstrated dramatic increases in reaction rate and yields.\n\nMechanism:\n\nThe Claisen rearrangement of aryl ethers can also be performed as a photochemical reaction. In addition to the traditional \"ortho\" product obtained under thermal conditions (the [3,3] rearrangement product), the photochemical variation also gives the \"para\" product ([3,5] product), alternate isomers of the allyl group (for example, [1,3] and [1,5] products), and simple loss of the ether group, and even can rearrange alkyl ethers in addition to allyl ethers. The photochemical reaction occurs via a stepwise process of radical-cleavage followed by bond-formation rather than as a concerted pericyclic reaction, which therefore allows the opportunity for the greater variety of possible substrates and product isomers. The [1,3] and [1,5] results of the photo-Claisen rearrangement are analogous to the photo-Fries rearrangement of aryl esters and related acyl compounds.\n\nAn iminium can serve as one of the pi-bonded moieties in the rearrangement.\n\nChromium can oxidize allylic alcohols to α,β-unsaturated ketones on the opposite side of the unsaturated bond from the alcohol. This is via a concerted hetero-Claisen reaction, although there are mechanistic differences since the chromium atom has access to d-orbitals which allow the reaction under a less constrained set of geometries.\n\nThe Chen–Mapp reaction, also known as the [3,3]-phosphorimidate rearrangement or Staudinger–Claisen reaction, installs a phosphite in the place of an alcohol and takes advantage of the Staudinger reduction to convert this to an imine. The subsequent Claisen is driven by the fact that a P=O double bond is more energetically favorable than a P=N double bond.\n\nThe Overman rearrangement (named after Larry Overman) is a Claisen rearrangement of allylic trichloroacetimidates to allylic trichloroacetamides.\nThe Overman rearrangement is applicable to the synthesis of vicinol diamino compounds from 1,2-vicinal allylic diols.\n\nUnlike typical Claisen rearrangements which require heating, zwitterionic Claisen rearrangements take place at or below room temperature. The acyl ammonium ions are highly selective for \"Z\"-enolates under mild conditions.\n\nThe enzyme chorismate mutase (EC 5.4.99.5) catalyzes the Claisen rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate, a key intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway towards the synthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine.\n\n"}

He discovered molecular mechanisms of infectious diseases, like antibiotic resistance and sounded the alarm for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. He championed the benefits of microorganisms. \nHe formulated molecular Koch's postulates, which have guided the study of the microbial determinants of infectious diseases since the late 1980s.\n\nFalkow was born into a Yiddish-speaking household in Albany, New York. His father was a shoe salesman and had immigrated from Soviet Kiev, Ukraine. \nHis mother came from a family of Jewish immigrants from Poland. She \"rented several of their bedrooms and later opened a corset shop\".\n\nFalkow attributed his early interest in microbiology to reading \"Microbe Hunters\" in 1943, when he was 11 years old, which he found at the public library after the family had moved to Newport, Rhode Island. The book is a dramatization of microbiological research written by American microbiologist Paul de Kruif.\nBecause of poor grades until his senior year of high school, an adviser suggested military rather than college.\n\nFalkow enrolled in biology at the University of Maine, because of their microbiology department. During the summers he worked in pathology at the hospital in Newport, staining slides and assisting in autopsies. He graduated in 1955. \nBefore he even started graduate school at University of Michigan, he developed acute anxiety. He avoided movie theaters between 1956 and 1981\nand dropped out of University, because of recurring panic attacks. He switched to Brown University and graduated with a PhD in 1961.\n\nHe became a staff member at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) in the Department of Bacterial Immunology, where he was eventually named the assistant chief of the department.\n\nHis early work in the 1960s focused on the genetic mechanisms, which enable bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics. He showed that organisms, such as shigella, can possess gene fragments called plasmids which exist apart from the bacterial chromosome, and that they carry specialized information for survival. Under selective pressure from antibiotics, one species of bacteria can pass its plasmids to another directly without mating, thereby preserving its own specialized survival genes.\n\nIn 1966, he joined Georgetown University School of Medicine as a professor of microbiology. He later moved to Seattle to join the faculty of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Here he described how meningitis and gonorrhea organisms acquire plasmids to become resistant to penicillin and other antibiotics.\n\nIn the 1970s, Falkow shifted his focus to the infection process. During this period, he showed that a life-threatening diarrhea prevalent in many developing countries is caused by a sub-type of E. coli. He also co-authored (with Royston C. Clowes, Stanley N. Cohen, Roy Curtiss III, Naomi Datta and Richard Novick) a proposal for uniform nomenclature for bacterial plasmids.\n\nIn 1981, he was named chairman of the Department of Medical Microbiology at Stanford University School of Medicine, a position he held until 1985. While at Stanford, Falkow encouraged Esther Lederberg to continue directing the Stanford Plasmid Reference Center, an internationally used registry for plasmids, transposons and insertion sequences.)\n\nStanley Falkow was married to Rhoda Ostroff with whom he had two daughters. They divorced.\nIn 1983, he married Lucy Tompkins, a former graduate student and infectious diseases specialist at Stanford. \nIn 2004 he was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome and given a prognosis of two years. \n\nHe died on May 5, 2018 at the age of 84 at his home in Portola Valley, California of myelodysplastic syndrome.\n\nFalkow has been referred to as the father of molecular microbial pathogenesis, the study of how infectious microbes and host cells interact to cause disease at the molecular level.\nFalkow adopted the perspective of viewing infection as a process that is ultimately mediated by the host. \nHe discovered that infectious microbes employ genes that are activated only inside host cells. His work carries clinical applications, such as a new vaccine for whooping cough.\n\nFalkow published numerous articles, and served on the editorial boards of several professional publications.\nHe received numerous awards for his achievements in science, including the Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Achievement in Infectious Disease Research, the Altemeier Medal from the Surgical Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Howard Taylor Ricketts Award Lecture at the University of Chicago, and the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize. In 2003, he received the Abbott Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society for Microbiology and the Selman A. Waksman Award in Microbiology from the National Academy of Sciences.\nHe received the Robert Koch Award in 2000.\n\nFalkow was elected President of the American Society for Microbiology from July 1997 through June 1998.

His brother, Ben Weese, is also a renowned architect.\n\nHarry Mohr Weese was born on June 30, 1915 in Evanston, Illinois as the first son of Harry E. and Marjorie Weese. His father was an Episcopalian, and his mother was a Presbyterian. In 1919, the family moved to a house in Kenilworth, Illinois, where Harry would be raised. Weese was enrolled in the progressive Joseph Sears School in 1919. By 1925, Weese decided that he wanted to be either an artist or an architect.\n\nAfter graduating from New Trier High School, Weese enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1933 to pursue a Bachelor in Architecture. Weese also took architecture classes at Yale University starting in 1936. Weese studied under Alvar Aalto at MIT and fraternized with classmates I.M. Pei and Eero Saarinen. As his schooling was at the height of the Great Depression, Weese eschewed studying the expensive historical revivals in favor of more affordable modern styles. In the summer of 1937, Weese toured northern Europe on a bicycle, fostering his appreciation for the modernist movement.\n\nUpon his return to the United States, Weese was offered a fellowship at the Cranbrook Academy of Art (sometimes called the \"Scandinavian Bauhaus\") through Eero Saarinen, whose father Eliel oversaw the school. There, he studied city planning, potter, and textiles while learning more about Modernist principles. He worked alongside other emerging Modernist designers such as Ralph Rapson, Florence Knoll, and Charles Eames.\n\nWeese formed an architectural partnership in Chicago with classmate Benjamin Baldwin upon their graduation in 1940. He would later marry Baldwin's sister, Kitty. Following the brief partnership, Weese joined the firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM). Soon after joining, however, Weese enlisted as an engineering officer in the United States Navy for World War II. Weese moved back to Chicago after the war in 1945 and rejoined SOM.\n\nIn 1947, Weese started his independent design firm, Harry Weese Associates. His first commissions, such as the Robert and Suzanne Drucker House in Wilmette, Illinois, were houses for family members and close associates. By the late 1950s, Weese began to receive major commissions. Although he continued to plan houses, Weese also built civic projects such as the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago.\n\nThe Washington Metro in the District of Columbia helped Weese become the foremost designer of rail systems during the peak of his career. He subsequently was commissioned to oversee rail projects in Miami, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Buffalo. He was named a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1961 and received the Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize from the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1964.\n\nWeese was also well known for his firm advocacy of historic preservation and was remembered as the architect who \"shaped Chicago’s skyline and the way the city thought about everything from the lakefront to its treasure-trove of historical buildings\". He led the restoration of Adler & Sullivan's Auditorium Building, and Daniel Burnham's Field Museum of Natural History and Orchestra Hall. Harry Weese & Associates received the Architecture Firm Award from the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1978. Weese also served as a judge for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial design competition, and helped defend fledgling architect Maya Lin's unconventional design against her critics.\n\nIn the late-70s, Weese was involved in the inception of the effort to host a 1992 World's Fair in Chicago.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s, Weese drank heavily and his reputation faded; he died after years of going in and out of alcohol rehabilitation and a series of disabling strokes.\n\nWeese's parents were Protestant Christians, but he himself was nonreligious. While being interviewed by the building committee of the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist in Chicago, when asked of his religious views, he said, \"My father was Episcopalian, my mother Presbyterian, and I’m an architect\".\n\nIn a 1998 obituary, architectural critic Herbert Muschamp wrote that \"Mr. Weese designed a systemwide network of stations that rank among the greatest public works of this century\", referring to his design of the Washington Metro system. Muschamp noted that the vaulted ceilings at the crossings of subway lines \"induce an almost religious sense of awe\".\n\nIn 2007, the design of the Washington Metro's vaulted-ceiling stations was voted number 106 on the \"America's Favorite Architecture\" list compiled by the American Institute of Architects (AIA), and was the only brutalist design to win a place among the 150 selected by this public survey. In January 2014, the AIA announced that it would present its Twenty-five Year Award to the Washington Metro system for \"an architectural design of enduring significance\" that \"has stood the test of time by embodying architectural excellence for 25 to 35 years\". The announcement cited the key role of Harry Weese, who conceived and implemented a \"common design kit-of-parts\" which continues to guide the construction of new Metro stations over a quarter-century later.\n\nWeese is best known as the designer and architect of the first group of stations in the Washington Metro system. Other well known works include:\n\nWeese also led numerous restoration projects including:\n\nAnd 80+ single home and residential buildings including:\n\n\n"}

He held the positions of Starosta of Owrucz, Crown Grand Standard-bearer, and Crown Great Guard (\"praefectus excubiarum seu vigiliarum\"). He served as a military commander and was given the \"nom de guerre\" \"zagończyk\" (brave raider), but later became infamous as an outlaw. He was known for his smile and quick wit, and allegedly introduced a traditional Polish haircut which bears his name.\n\nŁaszcz is alleged to have started his military career at the age of 17, serving under the famous commander Stefan Chmielecki, with whom he practiced his military skills in the \"Dzikie Pola.\" He took part in the Khotyn campaign (1621) and fought later in 1633 against Mehmed Abazi Pasha during the Polish–Ottoman War (1633–34), during which fame of his bravery grew. He fought during the Swedish invasion of 1626-29, and in numerous other battles against the Crimean Tatars (e.g. 1624, 1629), the rebellious Commonwealth Zaporozhian Cossacks, (e.g. at the Battle of Kumeyki in 1637), and during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. He was known as \"stretch tatarski\" (Tatar terror) and considered a successful commander.\n\nBefore the Battle of Kumeyki, he brought 500 horsemen and 300 infantry to the army lines. During the campaign, field hetman Mikołaj Potocki ordered Łaszcz's command to provoke the Cossacks to abandon their positions and pursue him. Łaszcz successfully carried out his orders, helping to bring about victory over the more numerous rebels. In 1638, he led his own command against the Cossacks and gained even greater military fame.\n\nŁaszcz and his company pillaged, robbed and raped victims across various noble estates, including peasants, merchants and many others, in the Commonwealth provinces of Ukraine, Red Ruthenia, Volhynia, and Podolia. He received 236 sentences of exile (banicja) and 37 sentences of infamy (infamia). He is rumoured to have sewn them into his coat (delia). He fought with Prince Jeremi Wiśniowiecki. He was protected from the law by the patronage of hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, because Koniecpolski admired the fact that Łaszcz, an able soldier and commander, could always be counted on to fight for the Commonwealth in times of war. From a legal point of view, as a professional soldier, Łaszcz was subject to military, not civil, jurisdiction. He was therefore able to enjoy the protection that Koniecpolski's status as a hetman offered him. However, when Koniecpolski died, Łaszcz was attacked at his estates by Prince Wiśniowiecki, being forced to escape and became a true outlaw, without a home or money. He was stripped of his offices and titles, finally relying on Prince Władysław Dominik Zasławski to offer him refuge. Prior to his expulsion by Prince Wiśniowiecki, his headquarters were in Makarów (Makarov) in Ukraine; after the lawful ousting by his enemies, he and his family were banished from their estates for the rest of their lives.\n\nWhen the Khmelnytsky Uprising began in 1648, Łaszcz fought against the rebels as part of the Zasławski party. However, his enemy, Prince Wiśniowiecki, demanded that he leave the army camp, due to an event that took place before the Battle of Pyliavtsi. Łaszcz, having 1000 men at his command, had attacked the Cossacks' camp, causing alarm and fear. He left but later fought in the defence of Lwów, scoring some successes against the besieging Cossack army. The Polish lower parliamentary house (sejm) granted him a \"salvus conductus\" (safe conduct) in return for his military services; however, he only participated in the campaigns of 1648, before falling ill and dying on 15 February 1649. He was buried at the Saint Stephen Church in Kraków. The church was demolished in 1802; thus, Łaszcz's tomb has been lost.\n\nThe historian Szymon Okolski wrote in his \"Dyaryusz\" that Łaszcz's mother was from the house of Koraczewska. Łaszcz married twice and had a daughter and two sons.\n\n"}

The CAG is also the external auditor of Government-owned corporations and conducts supplementary audit of government companies, i.e., any non-banking/non-insurance company in which Union Government has an equity share of at least 51 per cent or subsidiary companies of existing government companies. The reports of the CAG are laid in Parliament/Legislatures and taken into consideration by the Public Accounts Committees (PACs) and Committees on Public Undertakings (COPUs), which are special committees in the Parliament of India and the state legislatures. The CAG is also the head of the Indian Audit and Accounts Department, the affairs of which are managed by officers of Indian Audit and Accounts Service, and has 43,576 employees across the country (as on 01.03.2020).\n\nThe CAG is mentioned in the Constitution of India under Article 148 – 151.\n\nThe CAG is ranked 9th and enjoys the same status as a judge of Supreme Court of India in Indian order of precedence. The current CAG of India is Rajiv Mehrishi, who assumed office on 25 September 2017. He is the 13th CAG of India.\n\nThe Comptroller and Auditor-General of India is appointed by the President of India following a recommendation by the Prime Minister. On appointment, he/she has to make an oath or affirmation before the President of India.\n\n\"I,(name of the person being appointed), having appointed Comptroller and Auditor-General of India do swear in the name of God/solemnly affirm that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, that I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India, that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my ability, knowledge and judgement perform the duties of my office without fear or favour, affection or ill-will and that I will uphold the Constitution and the laws.\"\n\nAs per the provisions of the constitution, the CAG's (DPC) (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971 was enacted. As per the various provisions, the duties of the CAG include the audit of:\n\n\nRecently the CAG under Vinod Rai has constantly been in the limelight for its reports exposing mega corruption, particularly in 2G spectrum case, Commonwealth Games scam, Coal mine allocation scam and others.\n\nIn June 2012, Lal Krishna Advani a veteran Indian politician and former Deputy Prime Minister of India (as well as former Leader of the Opposition in Indian Parliament) suggested that CAG's appointment should be made by a bipartisan collegium consisting of the prime minister, the Chief Justice of India, the Law Minister and the Leaders of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. Subsequently, M Karunanidhi, the head of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party and five times Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu supported the suggestion. Advani made this demand to remove any impression of bias or lack of transparency and fairness because, according to him, the current system was open to \"manipulation and partisanship\". Similar demand was made by many former CEC's such as B B Tandon, N Gopalaswamy and S Y Quraishi, however the government did not seem too keen.\n\nCPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta wrote a letter to the PM and demand CAG be appointed by the collegium of consisting the PM, the CJI and the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha but the PM declined. Former CAG V. K. Shunglu has suggested in its CWG scam report that CAG be made a multi-member body.\n\nPMO minister V.Narayanasamy in his interview with PTI said Government is considering the Shunglu panel report but PM and Finance Minister declined it. Later V. Narayanasamy said he misquoted but PTI reaffirmed it.\n\nThe salary and other conditions of service of the CAG are determined by the Parliament of India through \"The Comptroller and Auditor-General (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971\". His salary is same as that of judge of the Supreme court of India. Neither his salary nor rights in respect of leave of absence, pension or age of retirement can be varied to his disadvantage \"after\" his appointment. The CAG is not eligible for further office either under the Government of India or under the Government of any State after he has ceased to hold his office. These provisions are in order to ensure the \"independence\" of CAG.\n\nThe CAG can be removed only on an address from both houses of parliament on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. The CAG vacates the office on attaining the age of 65 years or 6 year term, which ever is earlier or by impeachment process.\n\nThe Constitution of India [Article 148] provides for an independent office to the CAG of India. He or she is the head of Indian Audit and Accounts Department. He/she has a duty to uphold the Constitution of India and laws of the Parliament to safeguard the interests of the public exchequer. The Indian Audit and Accounts Service aids the CAG in the discharge of his/her functions.\n\nAudit of government accounts (including the accounts of the state governments) in India is entrusted to the CAG of India who is empowered to audit all expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of the union or state governments, whether incurred within India or outside, all revenue into the Consolidated Funds and all transactions relating to the Public Accounts and the Contingency Funds of the Union and the states. Specifically, audits include:\n\nIn addition, the CAG also executes performance and compliance audits of various functions and departments of the government. Recently, the CAG as a part of thematic review on \"Introduction of New Trains\" is deputing an auditors' team on selected trains, originating and terminating at Sealdah and Howrah stations, to assess the necessity of their introduction. In a path-breaking judgement, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the CAG General could audit private firms in revenue-share deals with government.\n\nCAG has been elected the Chairman of the United Nations' Board of Auditors. CAG has been appointed as external auditor of eleven UN organisations:\n\n\nOmkar Goswami is an Indian who is presently one of the External Auditors of the UN organisation World Food Programme (WFP) headquartered at Rome, Italy.\n\nIn 2012 CAG was complimented for its professionalism, training & infrastructure by its US counterpart\n\nIn November 2009, the CAG requested the government to amend the 1971 Audit Act to bring all private-public partnerships (PPPs), Panchayti Raj Institutions and societies getting government funds within the ambit of the CAG. The amendment further proposes to enhance CAG's powers to access information under the Audit Act. In the past, almost 30% of the documents demanded by CAG officials have been denied to them. The PPP model has become a favourite mode of executing big infrastructure projects worth millions of rupees and these projects may or may not come under the audit purview of the CAG, depending on sources of funds and the nature of revenue sharing agreements between the government and the private entities. As of 2013, it is estimated that 60 percent of government spending does not come under the scrutiny of the CAG.\n\nFollowing are some of the most debated CAG reports:\nA CAG report on issue of Licences and Allocation of 2G Spectrum resulted in a huge controversy. The report estimated that there was a \"presumptive loss\" of by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. In a chargesheet filed on 2 April 2011 by the investigating agency Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the agency pegged the loss at \n\nAll the speculations of profit, loss and no-loss were put to rest on 2 February 2012 when the Supreme Court of India on a public interest litigation (PIL) declared allotment of spectrum as \"\"unconstitutional and arbitrary\"\" and quashed all the 122 licenses issued in 2008 during tenure of A. Raja (then minister for communications & IT in the UPA government) the main accused. The court further said that A. Raja \"wanted to favour some companies at the cost of the public exchequer\" and \"virtually gifted away important national asset\".\n\nRevenue loss calculation was further established on 3 August 2012 when according to the directions of the Supreme Court, Govt of India revised the reserve price for 2G spectrum to .\n\nHowever, the special court in New Delhi acquitted all accused in the 2G spectrum case including prime accused A Raja and Kanimozhi on December 21, 2017, the verdict was based on the fact that CBI could not find any evidence against the accused in those 7 years. Per the judgement, \"Some people created a scam by artfully arranging a few selected facts and exaggerating things beyond recognition to astronomical levels.\"\n\nA 2012 CAG report on coal mine allocation received massive media and political reaction as well as public outrage. During the 2012 monsoon session of the Parliament, the BJP protested the Government's handling of the issue demanding the resignation of the prime minister and refused to have a debate in the Parliament. The deadlock resulted in Parliament functioning only seven of the twenty days of the session.\n\nThe CAG report criticised the Government by saying it had the authority to allocate coal blocks by a process of competitive bidding, but chose not to. As a result, both public sector enterprises (PSEs) and private firms paid less than they might have otherwise. In its draft report in March, the CAG estimated that the \"windfall gain\" to the allocatees was . The CAG Final Report tabled in Parliament put the figure at \n\nWhile the initial CAG report suggested that coal blocks could have been allocated more efficiently, resulting in more revenue to the government, at no point did it suggest that corruption was involved in the allocation of coal. Over the course of 2012, however, the question of corruption came to dominate the discussion. In response to a complaint by the BJP, the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) directed the CBI to investigate the matter. The CBI named a dozen Indian firms in a First Information Report (FIR), the first step in a criminal investigation. These FIRs accuse them of overstating their net worth, failing to disclose prior coal allocations, and hoarding rather than developing coal allocations. The CBI officials investigating the case have speculated that bribery may be involved.\n\nThe scandal was first exposed due to the CAG report in the matter in December 1995. The report alleged of fraudulent withdrawal of government funds worth in the Bihar animal husbandry department against non-existent supplies of fodder and medicines. Subsequently, based on Patna High Court's orders, CBI investigated the case and registered as many as 63 cases. Many accused have been convicted while many cases are still under trial.\n\nThe oil ministry imposed a fine of ₹7000 crores on Mukesh Ambani's company for the sharp drop in production of gas and violations mentioned in CAG's 2011 report. Oil ministry did not approve company's US$7.2 billion stake in deal with BP. So Jaipal Reddy known for his honesty was shifted from oil ministry to the Science and Technology ministry owing to pressure from Reliance group of Industries. RIL allowed the CAG to begin the audit in April this year after stalling it for a year. But unresolved issues could stall audit of KG Basin again. Then Reliance appointed Defence Secretary Shashikant Sharma as new CAG to audit KG Basin, said Prashant Bhushan. In KG D-6, most of the cost had been recovered by the private player and the increase in price would only go as profit. About 90% of receipts from K-G D-6 were so far booked as expenditure and in the remaining 10%, only 1% was paid to the government and rest 9% went to the operator as profit.\n\nSource:\n"}

She was one of the last two Town class cruisers, which formed the \"Edinburgh\" sub-class. \"Edinburgh\" saw a great deal of combat service during the Second World War, especially in the North Sea and the Arctic Sea, where she was sunk by torpedoes in 1942.\n\n\"Edinburgh\" was built in Newcastle-upon-Tyne by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson, her keel laid down on 30 December 1936. She was a fast cruiser, displacing 10,635 tonnes, and with an intended sea speed of , reaching a maximum speed of thirty-three knots.\n\nThe ship was heavily armed for a light cruiser, with twelve 6 inch guns, twelve (later eight) 4 inch anti-aircraft (AA) guns (along with her sister ship, the heaviest 4-in battery among all the British cruisers), sixteen 2-pounder pom pom guns, in addition to sixteen Vickers .50 machine guns. Also, she carried six 21 inch (533 mm) torpedoes in a pair of triple racks, giving the ship extra firepower.\n\n\"Edinburgh\" was designed as a very modern vessel, equipped with an impressive radar array and fire-control systems, and the ability to carry up to three Supermarine Walrus seaplanes for reconnaissance, though she usually carried only two.\n\nHer armour thickness statistics were on the main belt, and at its thinnest, the heaviest of all the British light cruisers. As with battlecruisers, light cruisers were intended to be fast enough to avoid engagements with more heavily armed opponents, negating the need for immensely thick armour like that found on the battleships of the day.\n\n\"Edinburgh\" was launched on 31 March 1938, and after commissioning in July 1939 was immediately attached to the 18th Cruiser Squadron at Scapa Flow, in Scotland, as part of the British Home Fleet. For a time, she was assigned to patrol between Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but in 1939, she was transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, serving with the Humber Force.\n\nHowever, \"Edinburgh\" was still in the Firth of Forth when the Luftwaffe made their first raid on the naval bases at Rosyth on 16 October 1939. She sustained minor damage from the attack, but no direct hits. Between the three ships damaged in the raid including \"Edinburgh\", the cruiser , and destroyer ; sixteen Royal Navy crew died and a further 44 were wounded, although this information was not made public at the time.\n\nShe left Rosyth on 23 October, on escort duties with the convoys heading to and from Narvik, in Norway. When the armed merchant cruiser was attacked and sunk defending her convoy on 23 November, \"Edinburgh\" was among the flotilla detached to search for the German commerce raider, the battleship , responsible. However, the search was unsuccessful, and \"Edinburgh\" returned to escort duties.\n\nOn 18 March 1940, she arrived in the Tyne for a lengthy refit which lasted until 28 October. After these repairs, she was re-attached to the 18th Cruiser Squadron, and on 18 November left Faslane Naval Base, on the Clyde, escorting the troop convoy WS4B as far as Freetown (now Sierra Leone) before returning to Scapa Flow on 12 November. Shortly before Christmas, \"Edinburgh\" participated in a hunt for a German surface raider that had been reported as breaking out into the North Atlantic. The force consisted of the battlecruiser , \"Edinburgh\", and the destroyers , , , and . After spending a week at sea, including Christmas Day, after the report turned out to be false, she returned to port on New Year's Eve.\n\nDuring the winter of 1940, \"Edinburgh\" took part in several minor operations with the Home Fleet. She escorted convoy WS7 to the Middle East, returning to Scapa Flow on 15 April. She supported several mine-laying operations off the Danish coast, and supported Operation \"Claymore\", the successful Allied raid on the German-occupied Lofoten Islands, on 4 May 1941.\n\n\"Edinburgh\" also played a minor role in the hunt for the in May 1941. She was on patrol in the Bay of Biscay, where she intercepted the German vessel on 22 May 1941. \"Edinburgh\" was sent to intercept \"Bismarck\" on her projected course for Brest, and then shadow her, but \"Bismarck\" never reached that area.\n\nOn 1 June, she was sent to relieve the light cruiser on the Denmark Strait patrol route. After an uneventful assignment, she was ordered to cover another Middle East-bound convoy, WS 9B, and docked in Gibraltar again in early July. Later that month, \"Edinburgh\" took part in Operation \"Substance\", arriving in Malta on 24 July. The next day, she had a close call when a German torpedo bomber attacked her. However, the ship sustained no damage, and continued on her course back to the Clyde.\n\nIn August 1941, \"Edinburgh\" escorted convoy WS10 to Simonstown, South Africa, and later sailed to Malta once more, this time as part of Operation \"Halberd\", arriving at Malta on 28 September. She returned to Gibraltar shortly afterwards, departing from there on 1 October 1941, with supplies and prisoners of war aboard, and bound once more for the Clyde. After repairs at Faslane, she rejoined the Home Fleet on Iceland Forces Patrol during November.\n\nIn December 1941, she provided cover to Arctic convoys bringing aid to the Soviet Union. From January 1942, she refitted in the Tyne, until 4 March, when she was once again placed on the Iceland-Faroes patrol.\n\nShe escorted two convoys to the Soviet Union (QP4 and PQ13), returning to Scapa Flow on 28 March. On 6 April, she left Scapa Flow to escort convoy PQ 14 to Murmansk. Of the 24 ships in PQ14, 16 were forced by unseasonal ice and bad weather to return to Iceland, and another was sunk by a U-boat. \"Edinburgh\" and the remaining seven vessels arrived in Murmansk on 19 April.\n\n\"Edinburgh\" was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Stuart Bonham Carter, commanding the escort of returning Convoy QP 11: 17 ships which left Murmansk on 28 April 1942. On 30 April, the (under the command of \"Kapitänleutnant\" Max-Martin Teichert) fired a torpedo into her starboard side, hitting her just forward of the space in which the gold was stored.\nThe U-boat, on her fifth patrol, had been alerted to the convoy by German aerial reconnaissance. The ship began to list heavily, but the crew reacted quickly and competently by closing watertight bulkheads, which prevented the ship from sinking immediately. Soon after, \"U-456\" put a second torpedo into \"Edinburgh\"s stern, wrecking her steering equipment and crippling her. In anticipation of \"Edinburgh\"s sinking, Stoker Francis James Dawson recovered her flag, later returning it to the Leith Museum in Edinburgh.\n\n\"Edinburgh\" was taken in tow, and tried to return to Murmansk with destroyers and , and four s; , , \"Niger\", and . Along the way she was hounded constantly by German torpedo bombers. On 2 May, as she progressed at a snail's pace under tow and her own power, she was attacked off Bear Island by three large German destroyers, , and .\n\n\"Edinburgh\" cast off the tow, so that she started to sail in circles. Although her guns were in disarray, she fired on the attacking German ships. Her second salvo straddled \"Hermann Schoemann\", damaging her severely enough that her crew scuttled her. \"Edinburgh\"s escorts drove off \"Z24\" and \"Z25\", but she was struck by a torpedo that had missed another ship. The torpedo struck \"Edinburgh\" amidships, exactly opposite the first torpedo hit from \"U-456\". She was now held together only by the deck plating and keel, which was likely to fail at any time, so the crew abandoned ship. \"Gossamer\" took off 440 men and \"Harrier\" about 400. Two officers and 56 other ranks were killed in the attacks. The vigorous action of the minesweepers led the Germans to mistake the power of the force they were facing.\n\n\"Harrier\" tried to scuttle \"Edinburgh\" with 4 inch gunfire, but 20 shots did not sink her. Depth charges dropped alongside also failed. Finally, \"Foresight\" sank \"Edinburgh\" with her last torpedo (the others having been expended against the German destroyers), the torpedo being fired by David Loram (later to become Vice-Admiral Sir David Loram).\n\nOn the return journey, \"Edinburgh\" was carrying of gold bullion back to the UK. The consignment, which had a value of about £1.5 million sterling in 1942 (adjusted for inflation to 20 pounds, £), was a partial payment by the USSR for the supplies of war material and military equipment from the Western Allies. In total the ship had 465 gold ingots in 93 wooden boxes stored in the bomb-room just aft of where the first torpedo - fired from \"U-456\" - struck.\n\nNine years after the Second World War, the British government offered the salvage rights on \"Edinburgh\" to the British salvage company, Risdon Beazley Ltd., in 1954. However the project was put on hold due to strained political relations with the Soviet Union. In 1957, the wreck was designated as a war grave, which further complicated any recovery attempts because of the limitations in salvage techniques of the era.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the British government became increasingly anxious to recover the gold; not only because of its value but also because there was a growing concern that the wreck might be looted by unscrupulous salvagers or by the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the early 1980s, seasoned diver Keith Jessop's company Jessop Marine, with the full guidance and support of Wharton Williams Ltd ~ a leading global diving company, and OSA ~ a specialist shipping company, won a contract to attempt a recovery. Cutting into the wreck by divers was deemed more appropriate for a war grave than the traditional 'smash and grab' explosives-oriented methods. The consortium of specialist companies for the project was then formed: Wharton Williams as managers, OSA and Decca. This group was contracted to Jessop Marine to attempt a recovery of the gold from the bomb room of the \"Edinburgh\".\n\nIn April 1981, the OSA survey ship \"Dammtor\", with Decca surveyors embarked under the direction of former Royal Naval Survey officer John Clarke, began searching for the wreck in the Barents Sea. The area was approximately north of the coast of the USSR and Norway. After less than 48 hours, Decca discovered the wreck at , about NNE of the Soviet coast at the Kola Inlet. The depth was . Deploying a Scorpio ROV, \"Dammtor\" took detailed film of the wreck, which allowed Wharton Williams and OSA to evaluate a recovery project. The survival of her twin sister ship lying in the Thames, permitted management and later the diving team to inspect and absorb the layout of the compartments surrounding the bomb room and, not least, the scale of the challenge in cutting into the ship 800 feet down in a hostile and remote location.\n\nLater that year, on 30 August, the OSA dive-support vessel \"Stephaniturm\" steamed to the site from Peterhead, and the diving operation began in earnest under the leadership of former RN Clearance Diving Officer, Mike Stewart. On 15 September 1981, diver John Rossier found the first bar of gold. By 7 October, when bad weather finally forced the cessation of the diving operation, 431 of 465 ingots had been recovered. At the time the haul was worth in excess of £40,000,000 sterling. This bullion recovery project created a World Record in deep diving which stands to this day.\n\nA further 29 bars were brought up in 1986 by the Consortium, bringing the total to 460, leaving five unaccounted for.\n\n\n"}

He fought in the Spanish Civil War as a volunteer in the artillery unit on Franco's side. He attended the University of La Laguna to study architecture, but after two years he quit his studies. \n\nHe moved to Madrid in 1945 and received a scholarship for the \"Art School of San Fernando\", where he graduated as a teacher of art and painting. Between 1964 and 1966 he lived in New York City, where a grant from Nelson Rockefeller allowed him to rent his own studio. He painted many works in New York, which were exhibited in the prestigious \"Catherine Viviano\" gallery.\n\nManrique returned to Lanzarote in 1966. His legacy on the island includes the art, culture and tourism centre at Jameos del Agua (1963-87); his Volcano House, Taro de Tahiche (1968); the restaurant at the restored Castillo de San José at Arrecife (1976); the visitors center at the Timanfaya National Park (1971); his Palm Grove House at Haria (1986); the Mirador del Rio (1973), and the Jardin de Cactus at Guatiza. He had a major influence on the planning regulations on Lanzarote following his recognition of its potential for tourism and lobbied successfully to encourage the sustainable development of the industry. One aspect of this is the lack of \"high rise\" hotels on the island. Those that are there are in generally keeping with the use of traditional colours in their exterior decoration.\n\nManrique died in a car accident at Tahíche, Teguise, very near the Fundación, his Lanzarote home, in 1992. He was aged 72.\n\nThe César Manrique foundation was set up in 1982 by César Manrique and a group of friends but wasn't officially opened until 1992 after Manrique died. The foundation, based at Manrique's home, following his move to a townhouse in the North of the Island, is a private, non-profit organisation set-up to allow tourists access to Manrique's home. The foundation is also an art-gallery featuring art created by Manrique himself as well as Art that he acquired during his life. The gallery includes original sketches by Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró. The money the foundation takes from ticket sales goes toward raising awareness about the art of Lanzarote, as well as being used to fund the foundation's \"artistic, cultural and environmental activities\".\n\nManrique's home itself is built within a 3,000 m lot, on the site of the Lanzarote eruptions in the 18th century, and was created upon Manrique's return from New York City in 1966. The rooms on the first floor, including the artist studios, were created with the intention of keeping with Lanzarote traditions, yet making them more modern with open spaces and large windows. The \"ground floor\", more appropriately titled the \"basement\", contains five areas situated within volcanic bubbles, the rooms bored into volcanic basalt. There is a central cave which houses a recreational area, including a swimming pool, a barbecue and a small dance floor.\n\nOnce outside the main house, the visitor comes to the outside area, where there is a small square with a fountain in the middle before approaching a small café area and the visitor shop. This area was once César Manrique's garage.\n\nOne of the foundation's fundamental missions is to oppose the spread of high-rise concrete across the Spanish coastline and her island. The foundation recently brought attention to 24 illegally erected hotels in Lanzarote.\n\n\nIn Lanzarote:\n\nOutside Lanzarote:\n\n\n"}

It is about north of Peterborough.\n\nYoung's Point gets its name from the founders of the village. The Young family settled the area and build the dam and a grist mill here. References are recorded in Susanna Moodie's Book \"Roughing it in the Bush.\" Later generations ran a store and built and operated the steamboat service for both cargo and passenger service to nearby Stoney Lake. The Stoney Lake Navigation Company office was near the original Young family homestead where a cairn now stands at lock 27. The Lockside Trading Company is home to one of the later generation buildings.\n\nYoung's Point is the home of Lock 27 of the Trent-Severn Waterway network. The lock has a lift of seven feet and was built in the early 1870s. To the south you can travel through Katchewanooka Lake towards Lakefield and on to Peterborough, to the north travel through Clear Lake and on to Stoney, Buckhorn and Pigeon Lakes and beyond.\n\nIn 1887 the Old Bridge Inn was built; originally run as a general store (the Kearney Store), it's now a bed and breakfast.\n\nIn addition, Young's Point is host to several recreational facilities, including, but not limited to; a golf course, several bed & breakfast hotels, marinas and restaurants.\n\nWith a low population density and significant amounts of privately owned wooded land, Young's Point is also a favorite spot for residents of nearby Peterborough and Lakefield to hunt, fish, partake in off-road activities (both motorized and not) and play paintball.\n\nYoung's Point is also home to Mink Island and the \"Legend of the Wailing Woman,\" a local legend about a previous resident (named Abbirah) of the island. A documented fact of the Ojibwe in the area, is the story of Polly Lee, a young woman who was to marry a resident of the Algoinkin neighbouring clan. As the daughter of the chieftain known as \"Handsome Jack\", this was a marriage of prestige and the Youngs' were invited to as the local white head of the clan. Unfortunately, she died from influenza. She is buried on a tiny island south of the hamlet, a silver cup denoted her grave. Although long gone, the cup was placed there by Jack to ensure she could get to Katchewanooka for water. Handsome Jack was commemorated by Jack's Lake north of Burleigh Falls, Ontario. Lovesick Lake in Burleigh Falls named after her love affair and Lee island south of the point where she is buried.\n\nAnother persistent rumour is that somewhere in Clear Lake a steamboat filled with weapons and gold sunk somewhere in the lake during a storm.

{"id": "1920900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920900", "title": "Siglap", "text": "Siglap\n\nSiglap is a neighbourhood located in Bedok in the East Region of Singapore. The area also encompasses the Frankel and Opera Estates and their names have sometimes been used interchangeably to refer to the approximate same area. The planning subzone area of Siglap as defined by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is confusingly and inaccurately referred to as the small strip of land between Victoria Junior College and Bedok South Avenue 1. It is a residential area where a majority live in landed homes such as freehold semi-detached houses and bungalows. Some of the land parcels near Siglap Centre have been redeveloped into serviced apartments and condominiums. The few Housing and Development Board flats in Siglap have been demolished in 2015 under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme. The East Coast Park is also located nearby, across the East Coast Parkway.\n\nThe present area of Siglap was founded by Tok Lasam, the Chieftain (Penghulu) of Siglap. It is believed that he sailed to Singapore to escape the Dutch's attack on his Sultanate of Gowa in the 1660s. According to legend, it was said that dark thunder clouds had appeared when he first landed in the area which led to the name \"Si-Gelap\", derived from the Malay word ‘gelap’, meaning \"\"darkness that conceals\"\".\n\nOther versions of his arrival include him as a Minangkabau prince arriving from Sumatra to visit the Bugis settlements in the Tanjong Rhu area and ultimately establishing Siglap in 1809. According to historians, his arrival might have coincided with a rare full solar eclipse on 4 March 1821 and hence the darkness might have referred to the eclipse, rather than the dark clouds.\n\nToday the graves of Tok Lasam, his wife and his panglima (Commander) can be found near Jalan Sempadan off Upper East Coast Road.\n\nSiglap in its early days had four kampongs, side by side each other along the coastline, they were from east to west starting from Jalan Hajijah, Kampong Hajijah, Kampong Goh Choo, Kampong Siglap and Kampong Lim Choo which ended near Siglap Road. There were also a small community of Japanese fishermen living in the area, although by the end of World War II (WWII) they had mostly vanished. The inland areas of Siglap consisted mostly of coconut and nutmeg plantations and in 1912 the Frankels bought over these plantations. The Frankels were wealthy Jewish business people originating from Lithuania and had decided to settle in Singapore after accumulating considerable wealth from their sale of rubber, bread and even furniture in Singapore and around the region. They settled in the estate and developed the area by building roads named after famous Operas of their time including Carmen and Aida, which gave rise to the name of Opera Estate as it is known today. They were influential people that welcomed distinguished guests like Albert Einstein to visit and tour the area. At the onset of WWII the Frankels left for the United States. The area as well as along the wider East Coast Stretch saw machine gun pillbox being installed by the British in anticipation of a sea-bound attack by the Japanese that never materialise. During the Japanese Occupation, the coasts of Siglap and several of the nearby hills were used as execution sites in the Sook Ching operation carried out by the Japanese to clear out anti-Japanese personnel, the operation mostly targeted the Chinese population. At the end of the war many mass graves had been found in the area, one of such place was near the junction of Bedok South Avenue 1 and Upper East Coast Road. In 1953 during the heydays of Singapore film making, Cathay-Keris Studio, one of two major film companies in Singapore, set up its studio along Jalan Keris and the surrounding area was commonly used for shooting scenes in the films. In 1962 a huge fire broke out at Kampong Siglap when firecrackers were burnt out of control and set the village ablaze. The few HDB flats built in the area were built in the aftermath of the fire to house the homeless victims. Starting from the mid-1960s, the Government embarked on an ambitious land reclamation project that saw the coastline of the entire East Coast Region shift outwards. As a result many villagers in the area could not depend on fishing as a form of livelihood and many eventually settled away or were relocated to the neighbouring estates. The reclaimed land was then redeveloped with numerous high rise flats built and the East Coast Parkway was also constructed. The area has throughout history been home to several of Singapore's Presidents including the first President of Singapore, Yusof Bin Ishak.\n\nThe terrain of Siglap can be divided into two, the inland and the outer coastal areas, with the former considerably hilly while the latter because it had mostly been reclaimed generally flat. The uneven terrain inland can be seen with the steep descent of Fidelio Street into the lower lying areas of Opera Estate at the Fidelio Circus. This has caused frequent flooding in Opera Estate in the past whenever it rained. The Government has since, starting from 1996, improved drainage and installed Singapore's first underground water detention tank to store excess rain water from the estate that would be discharged after the rain has stopped.\n\nSiglap is served by amenities like the Siglap Centre, Siglap New Market, Siglap Shopping Centre and Siglap V which are mainly found at the junction of Siglap Road and East Coast Road. East Coast Road and Upper East Coast Road are also lined with several restaurants, food courts and shops. Additionally the entire estate is dotted with shophouses for the convenience of residents. The Siglap Park Connector that leads to either the Bedok Reservoir Park or the East Coast Park runs west of the estate along the Siglap Canal. The Siglap Linear Park which is similar to a park connector cuts through the area too, running from Opera Estate to East Coast Park. Siglap is part of the Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency and has one community centre, the Siglap South Community Centre, it is not to be confused with the Siglap Community Centre that serves the Bedok South Estate which is part of the East Coast Group Representation Constituency. The Wisma Mendaki Headquarters is another social facility located in the estate and serves the Malay community of the greater Geylang area too.\n\nThere are various places of worship like the Bethany Evangelical Free Church, Bethesda Frankel Estate Church, Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour, Ean Keng Si Buddhist Temple (延庆寺), Kim San Temple (金山寺斗山宫), Masjid Kampong Siglap and The Emmanuel Assembly of God Church.\n\nThe area falls under the jurisdiction of the Siglap Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP), which is part of the Bedok Police Division, and the 2nd Singapore Civil Defence Force DIV HQ.\n\nThere are currently several schools in the area namely (5 of which are public government schools):\n\nDespite the lower population density of the estate because it contains mostly landed houses, as opposed to HDB flats, the area still has a rich history of having numerous schools. Excluding the schools that have operated from the holding site campus due to PRIME initiatives by the Ministry of Education at the junction of New Upper Changi Road and Bedok South Road, these are the schools which no longer operate in the estate and all but one of which are defunct:\n\nThese are the schools that have operated from the PRIME holding site campus chronologically:\n\nMarine Parade Bus Terminal was operational from 5 July 1981 till 16 September 2001 when it was closed to make way for the construction of Victoria School. Most of the bus services that originated from the terminal were subsequently extended to Bedok Bus Interchange or the newly opened Upper East Coast Bus Terminal further east, while others were made to loop around the site or had their routes cut short. Today, there are still many bus services that ply along Upper East Coast Road and Marine Parade Road that run through the south of Siglap, in contrast, however the services cutting through the Frankel and Opera Estate areas are limited and these services are 32, 40, 42 and 401.\n\nSiglap is served by the Kembangan and Bedok MRT Stations, on the East West MRT line. However, in 2023 a closer station, Siglap MRT station, on the Thomson–East Coast line, will open on Marine Parade Road near Victoria School and bring greater and faster connectivity to the city or Changi Airport.\n\nThe East Coast Parkway (ECP) is an expressway that lies south of Siglap. Exit 7 and 8 of the expressway lead directly into the estate. The streets in Siglap (First to Fourth Street) off Siglap Road, were numerically named in 1958.\n\nThe historic site of Kubur Kassim (also known to contain Keramat Sheikh Ali), an old Malay Cemetery that is nestled in the heart of Siglap is the final resting place of many Muslims in the area in the past. Several prominent people buried there include Dr Hafeezudin Sirajuddin Moonshi founder of the first Muslim Clinic in Singapore. There are even graves allocated for the mythological Orang Bunian inside. This site coupled with Masjid Kassim located in Telok Kurau originally belonged to Ahna Mohamed Kassim bin Ally Mohamed who was endowed with it in 1921. Today the 2.02 hectares cemetery contains a distinctive yellow gate and is at least 90 over years old. Despite it being a cemetery it is entirely surrounded by landed houses and condominiums. \n\n\n\n\n \n"}

On 31 October 1786 she married Colonel Richard St George (d. 1790). Her husband died only four years later in Portugal, leaving one son, Charles Manners St George, who became a diplomat.\n\nBetween 1799 and 1800, Melesina travelled around Europe, especially Germany. It was during these travels that she met Lord Nelson, Lady Hamilton and the cream of European society, including Rivarol, Lucien Bonaparte, and John Quincy Adams while living in Germany. She later recounted anecdotes of these meetings in her memoirs.\n\nOn 3 March 1803 in Paris she married again. Her second husband was Richard Trench (1774–1860), sixth son of Frederick Trench (1724–97) and brother of Lord Ashtown.\n\nAfter the breakdown of the Peace of Amiens, Richard Trench was detained in France by Napoleon's armies, and in August 1805 Melesina took it upon herself to petition Napoleon in person and plead for her husband's release. Her husband was released in 1807, and the couple settled at Elm Lodge in Bursledon, Hampshire, England.\n\nTheir son Francis Chenevix Trench was born in 1805. In 1807, when they were on holiday in Dublin, their son Richard Chenevix Trench was born. He went on to be the Archbishop of Dublin, renowned poet and contemporary of Tennyson. Her only daughter died a few years later, aged four.\n\nShe corresponded with (amongst others) Mary Leadbeater, with whom she worked to improve the lot of the peasantry at her estate at Ballybarney.\n\nMelesina Trench's diaries and letters were compiled posthumously by Richard Chenevix Trench as \"The remains of the late Mrs. Richard Trench\" in 1861 with an engraving of her taken from a painting by George Romney. Another oil painting, \"The Evening Star\" by Sir Thomas Lawrence, had her as a subject, and she was reproduced in portrait miniatures; one in Paris by Jean-Baptiste Isabey and another by Hamilton that was copied by the engraver Francis Engleheart.\n\nCopies of a number of her works are held at Chawton House Library.\n\n"}

Instead of modulating the amplitude of two carrier waves, CAP generates a QAM signal by combining two PAM signals filtered through two filters designed so that their impulse responses form a Hilbert pair. If the impulse responses of the two filters are chosen as sine and a cosine, the only mathematical difference between QAM and CAP waveforms is that the phase of the carrier is reset at the beginning of each symbol. If the carrier frequency and symbol rates are similar, the main advantage of CAP over QAM is simpler implementation. The modulation of the baseband signal with the quadrature carriers is not necessary with CAP, because it is part of the transmit pulse.\n\nCAP finds application in HDSL and in early proprietary ADSL variants. For HDSL, the American ANSI standard specifies 2B1Q rather than CAP, while the European ETSI ETR 152 and the international ITU-T G.991.2 standards specify both CAP and 2B1Q. For ADSL deployments CAP was the de facto standard up until 1996, deployed in 90 percent of ADSL installs. The standardized variants of ADSL, ANSI T1.413 Issue 2 and G.dmt, as well as the successors ADSL2, ADSL2+, VDSL2, and G.fast, do not specify CAP, but rather discrete multi-tone (DMT) modulation.\n\nCAP used for ADSL divides the available frequency spectrum into three bands. The range from 0 to 4 kHz is allocated for POTS transmissions. The range of 25 kHz to 160 kHz is allocated for upstream data traffic and the range of 240 kHz to 1.5 MHz is allocated for downstream data traffic, in a frequency-division duplexing (FDD) scheme.\n\n"}

The river rises in the fertile Beqaa Valley, west of Baalbek, and empties into the Mediterranean Sea north of Tyre. Exceeding 140 km in length, the Litani River is the longest river in Lebanon and provides an average annual flow estimated at 920 million cubic meters. The waters of the Litani both originate and flow entirely within the borders of Lebanon. It provides a major source for water supply, irrigation and hydroelectricity both within Southern Lebanon, and the country as a whole.\n\nThe Litani River is named after the Canaanite deity Lotan, a seven-headed sea serpent and servant of the sea god Yam. The river that winds and coils like a serpent through the Beqaa Valley was believed to be the personification of the deity.\n\nHistorians in the past have claimed that the location of Biblical Misrephoth Maim, the place to which Joshua chased the various tribes after their defeat at the waters of Merom, was the river-mouth of the Litani River, but it is unlikely as the name \"Litani\" predates that of the Biblical story.\n\nThe Litani was a natural frontier that prevented the Seleucids from encroaching on the Ptolemaic dominion in the Levant.\n\nAfter heading south parallel to the Syrian border, the course of the river bends dramatically westward. Near this bend, the Litani comes within five km of the Hasbani River.\n\nThe portion of the river flowing west is called the Qasimiyeh. The Qasmieh-Ras-el-Aïn region, irrigated from the river's lower reaches from main irrigation canals, to south and north, is one of the largest irrigated areas in the nation, consisting of 32.64 km², shared among 1257 irrigating farmers, who concentrate on citrus crops and bananas (Raad 2004). For the entire stretch of the Qasimiyeh as it flows into the Mediterranean Sea, the Litani River remains nearly parallel to (and about north of) the Israeli-Lebanese border. 10 km north of Tyre, the river is crossed by the ancient Leontes Bridge. In June 1941, the mouth of the river was the site of an attack by British commandos and Australian troops on Vichy French forces that became known as the Battle of the Litani River.\n\nQaraoun, an artificial lake of 12 square km, was created by the Litani River Dam, 60 meters high and 1,350 meters in length, which was completed in 1959. A spillway of 6503 meters carries the water to the underground station where generators produce a maximum of 185 megawatts of electricity, the largest hydroelectric project in Lebanon. The dam was intended eventually to provide irrigation for 310 km² of farmland in South Lebanon and 80 km² in the Beqaa Valley. The office is at the southern (dam) end of the lake on the left side. The lakeside has a hotel and a number of restaurants specializing in fresh trout.\n\nThe Litani River Authority was formed in 1954 to facilitate the integrated development of the Litani River Basin. Shortly after its formation, the authority engaged in a massive hydroelectric development project that tapped the 850 meter head potential between Lake Qaraoun and the Mediterranean. This development has brought about major hydrological changes to the Litani River Basin, where the flows from its upper reaches above Lake Qaraoun, referred to as the Upper Litani Basin, are diverted through a system of tunnels, ponds and plants, to meet the Mediterranean several kilometers north of its original natural tailwater. These changes have resulted in the effective hydrological separation between the Upper Litani Basin and the lower reaches. The advent of a protracted civil strife in the 1970s followed by a prolonged occupation in the 1980s that lasted into the 1990s, have plunged the country into disarray, freezing development and investment in infrastructure. The subsequent return to normal conditions has encouraged the river authority to initiate several major water diversion projects from the Upper Litani Basin worth hundreds of millions of US dollars.\n\n\n\n\n"}

With a radical tailless, forward-swept wing design, the aircraft appeared futuristic; however, the project was canceled before either of the two prototypes were completed.\n\nThe project was originally designated XA-44 in 1945 under the old \"attack\" category. An unusual forward-swept wing-design powered by three J35-GE turbojets, the project was developed in parallel with Convair's XB-46. The original design had a wing with a 12° forward-sweep and a solid nose section, but when the Army Air Force revamped the advanced attack aircraft requirement into a light bomber requirement in 1946, the aircraft was redesignated XB-53 and the wing redesigned with a 30° forward-sweep and 8° dihedral that was borrowed from German wartime research, but also a glazed nose section. The swept-forward configuration would give the aircraft a greater climb rate and maneuverability. It looked promising enough at one point for the Army Air Force to consider canceling the XB-46 in favor of the XA-44, since there was not enough funding for both.\n\nClassified as a medium bomber, the XB-53 would have carried up to 12,000 pounds of bombs as well as 40 High Velocity Aerial Rockets (HVAR) mounted on underwing pylons.\n\nConvair argued for completion of the XB-46 prototype as a flying testbed, without armament and other equipment, and with the substitution of two XA-44s for the other two B-46 airframes on contract. The Air Force ratified this in June 1946 but the project did not progress, nor were additional B-46s built. The XB-53 program was reinstated in February 1949 but only for a short while.\n\n"}

In physics, he is known for his work on the large N expansion, a method of approximating the spectrum of atoms based on the consideration of an infinite-dimensional version of the problem, and for his work on the quantum theory of light inside dielectrics.\n\nHe is known to a wider audience through his books for the general public, five of which have been \"New York Times\" best-sellers, including \"The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives\", which was chosen as a \"New York Times\" notable book, and short-listed for the Royal Society Science Book Prize; The Grand Design, co-authored with Stephen Hawking, which argues that invoking God is not necessary to explain the origins of the universe; \"War of the Worldviews\", co-authored with Deepak Chopra; and \"Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior\", which won the 2013 PEN/E.O. Wilson Award for Literary Science Writing. He is also known through his public lectures and media appearances on programs ranging from \"Morning Joe\" to \"Through the Wormhole\", and for debating Deepak Chopra on ABC's \"Nightline\".\n\nMlodinow was born in Chicago, Illinois, of parents who were both Holocaust survivors. His father, who spent more than a year in the Buchenwald concentration camp, had been a leader in the Jewish resistance in his hometown of Częstochowa, in Nazi Germany-occupied Poland. As a child, Mlodinow was interested in both mathematics and chemistry, and while in high school was tutored in organic chemistry by a professor from the University of Illinois. As recounted in his book \"Feynman's Rainbow\", his interest turned to physics during a semester he took off from college to spend on a kibbutz in Israel, during which he had little to do at night besides reading \"The Feynman Lectures on Physics\", which was one of the few English books he found in the kibbutz library.\n\nMlodinow completed his doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley. It was in that PhD dissertation that he developed a new type of perturbation theory for nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, based upon solving the problem in infinite dimensions, and then correcting for the fact that we live in three. The method has become the basis of the 1/d expansion used by theoretical chemists. He has also done pioneering and innovative work in the quantum theory of nonlinear optics. The central problem of quantum nonlinear optics is how to quantize a dielectric that, as well as the usual homogeneities and anisotropy, can also have nonlinearities and dispersion, and earlier attempts in this direction, while incorporating the known linear theory, had not fully reproduced the nonlinear equations.\n\nIn 1981, Mlodinow joined the faculty at Caltech. Later, he was named an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow and worked at the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics in Munich, Germany. In 1986, Mlodinow left full-time academia to begin a writing career. In addition to his books, he wrote many episodes for a number of television series including \"\" and \"MacGyver\", created computer games with director Steven Spielberg and actor Robin Williams, and wrote the screenplay for the 2009 film \"Beyond the Horizon\". He also continued to conduct research in theoretical physics, and again joined the faculty of Caltech in 2005, leaving in 2013. His latest work in physics concerns the arrow of time, quantum decoherence, and the relation between discrete quantum random walks and the relativistic equations of quantum theory.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1920949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920949", "title": "FOXP3", "text": "FOXP3\n\nFOXP3 (forkhead box P3), also known as scurfin, is a protein involved in immune system responses. A member of the FOX protein family, FOXP3 appears to function as a master regulator of the regulatory pathway in the development and function of regulatory T cells. Regulatory T cells generally turn the immune response down. In cancer, an excess of regulatory T cell activity can prevent the immune system from destroying cancer cells. In autoimmune disease, a deficiency of regulatory T cell activity can allow other autoimmune cells to attack the body's own tissues.\n\nWhile the precise control mechanism has not yet been established, FOX proteins belong to the forkhead/winged-helix family of transcriptional regulators and are presumed to exert control via similar DNA binding interactions during transcription. In regulatory T cell model systems, the FOXP3 transcription factor occupies the promoters for genes involved in regulatory T-cell function, and may inhibit transcription of key genes following stimulation of T cell receptors.\n\nThe human FOXP3 genes contain 11 coding exons. Exon-intron boundaries are identical across the coding regions of the mouse and human genes. By genomic sequence analysis, the FOXP3 gene maps to the \"p\" arm of the X chromosome (specifically, X\"p\"11.23).\n\nFoxp3 is a specific marker of natural T regulatory cells (nTregs, a lineage of T cells) and adaptive/induced T regulatory cells (a/iTregs), also identified by other less specific markers such as CD25 or CD45RB. In animal studies, Tregs that express Foxp3 are critical in the transfer of immune tolerance, especially self-tolerance.\n\nThe induction or administration of Foxp3 positive T cells has, in animal studies, led to marked reductions in (autoimmune) disease severity in models of diabetes, multiple sclerosis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, thyroiditis and renal disease. Human trials using regulatory T cells to treat graft-versus-host disease have shown efficacy.\n\nFurther work has shown that T cells are more plastic in nature than originally thought. This means that the use of regulatory T cells in therapy may be risky, as the T regulatory cell transferred to the patient may change into T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which are pro-inflammatory rather than regulatory cells. Th17 cells are proinflammatory and are produced under similar environments as a/iTregs. Th17 cells are produced under the influence of TGF-β and IL-6 (or IL-21), whereas a/iTregs are produced under the influence of solely TGF-β, so the difference between a proinflammatory and a pro-regulatory scenario is the presence of a single interleukin. IL-6 or IL-21 is being debated by immunology laboratories as the definitive signaling molecule. Murine studies point to IL-6 whereas human studies have shown IL-21. Foxp3 is the major transcription factor controlling T-regulatory cells (T or CD4 cells). CD4 cells are leukocytes responsible for protecting animals from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Defects in this gene's ability to function can cause IPEX syndrome (IPEX), also known as X-linked autoimmunity-immunodeficiency syndrome as well as numerous cancers. While CD4 cells are heavily regulated and require multiple transcription factors such as STAT-5 and AhR in order to become active and function properly, Foxp3 has been identified as the master regulator for T lineage. Foxp3 can either act as a transcriptional activator or suppressor depending on what specific transcriptional factors such as deacetylases and histone acetylases are acting on it. The Foxp3 gene is also known to convert naïve T-cells to T cells, which are capable of an \"in vivo and in vitro\" suppressive capabilities suggesting that Foxp3 is capable of regulating the expression of suppression-mediating molecules. Clarifying the gene targets of Foxp3 could be crucial to the comprehension of the suppressive abilities of T cells.\n\nIn human disease, alterations in numbers of regulatory T cells – and in particular those that express Foxp3 – are found in a number of disease states. For example, patients with tumors have a local relative excess of Foxp3 positive T cells which inhibits the body's ability to suppress the formation of cancerous cells. Conversely, patients with an autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have a relative dysfunction of Foxp3 positive cells. The Foxp3 gene is also mutated in \"IPEX\" syndrome (\"I\"mmunodysregulation, \"P\"olyendocrinopathy, and \"E\"nteropathy, \"X\"-linked). Many patients with IPEX have mutations in the DNA-binding forkhead domain of FOXP3.\n\nIn mice, a Foxp3 mutation (a frameshift mutation that result in protein lacking the forkhead domain) is responsible for 'Scurfy', an X-linked recessive mouse mutant that results in lethality in hemizygous males 16 to 25 days after birth. These mice have overproliferation of CD4 T-lymphocytes, extensive multiorgan infiltration, and elevation of numerous cytokines. This phenotype is similar to those that lack expression of CTLA-4, TGF-β, human disease IPEX, or deletion of the Foxp3 gene in mice (\"scurfy mice\"). The pathology observed in scurfy mice seems to result from an inability to properly regulate CD4 T-cell activity. In mice overexpressing the Foxp3 gene, fewer T cells are observed. The remaining T cells have poor proliferative and cytolytic responses and poor interleukin-2 production, although thymic development appears normal. Histologic analysis indicates that peripheral lymphoid organs, particularly lymph nodes, lack the proper number of cells.\n\nIn addition to FoxP3's role in regulatory T cell differentiation, multiple lines of evidence have indicated that FoxP3 play important roles in cancer development.\n\nDown-regulation of FoxP3 expression has been reported in tumour specimens derived from breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer patients, indicating that FoxP3 is a potential tumour suppressor gene. Expression of FoxP3 was also detected in tumour specimens derived from additional cancer types, including pancreatic, melanoma, liver, bladder, thyroid, cervical cancers. However, in these reports, no corresponding normal tissues was analyzed, therefore it remained unclear whether FoxP3 is a pro- or anti-tumourigeneic molecule in these tumours.\n\nTwo lines of functional evidence strongly supported that FoxP3 serves as tumour suppressive transcription factor in cancer development. First, FoxP3 represses expression of HER2, Skp2, SATB1 and MYC oncogenes and induces expression of tumour suppressor genes P21 and LATS2 in breast and prostate cancer cells. Second, over-expression of FoxP3 in melanoma, glioma, breast, prostate and ovarian cancer cell lines induces profound growth inhibitory effects in vitro and in vivo. However, this hypothesis need to be further investigated in future studies.\n\nFoxp3 is a recruiter of other anti-tumor enzymes such as CD39 and CD8. The overexpression of CD39 is found in patients with multiple cancer types such as melanoma, leukemia, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and ovarian cancer. This overexpression may be protecting tumorous cells, allowing them to create their “escape phase”. A cancerous tumor's “escape phase” is where the tumor grows quickly and it becomes clinically invisible by becoming independent of the extracellular matrix and creating its own immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The consequences of a cancer cell reaching the “escape phase” is that it allows it to completely evade the immune system, which reduces the immunogenicity and ability to become clinically detected, allowing it to progress and spread throughout the body. Some cancer patients have also been known to display higher numbers of mutated CD4 cells. These mutated cells will then produce large quantities of TGF-β and IL-10, (a Transforming Growth Factor β and an inhibitory cytokine respectively,) which will suppress signals to the immune system and allow for tumor escape. In one experiment a 15-mer synthetic peptide, P60, was able to inhibit Foxp3's ability to function. P60 did this by entering the cells and then binding to Foxp3, where it hinders Foxp3's ability to translocate to the nucleus. Due to this, Foxp3 could no longer properly suppress the transcription factors NF-kB and NFAT; both of which are protein complexes that regulate transcription of DNA, cytokine production and cell survival. This would inhibit a cell's ability to perform apoptosis and stop its own cell cycle, which could potentially allow an affected cancerous cell to survive and reproduce.\n\nMutations or disruptions of the Foxp3 regulatory pathway can lead to organ-specific autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes mellitus. These mutations affect thymocytes developing within the thymus. Regulated by Foxp3, it's these thymocytes that during thymopoiesis, are transformed into mature Treg cells by the thymus. It was found that patients who have the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) possess Foxp3 mutations that affect the thymopoiesis process, preventing the proper development of T cells within the thymus. These malfunctioning T cells aren’t efficiently being regulated by its transcription factors, which cause them to attack cells that are healthy, leading to these organ-specific autoimmune diseases. Another way that Foxp3 helps keep the autoimmune system at homeostasis is through its regulation of the expression of suppression-mediating molecules. For instance, Foxp3 is able to facilitate the translocation of extracellular adenosine into the cytoplasm. It does this by recruiting CD39, a rate-limiting enzyme that's vital in tumor suppression to hydrolyze ATP to ADP in order to regulate immunosuppression on different cell populations.\n\n\n"}

The day use area of the park is open daily from dawn to dusk. The park also has a camping area as well that accommodates tent camping only. Its sheer cliffs of tuff and basalt are ideal for rock climbing of all difficulty levels. Smith Rock is generally considered the birthplace of modern American sport climbing, and is host to cutting-edge climbing routes. It is popular for sport climbing, traditional climbing, multi-pitch climbing, and bouldering.\n\nThe geology of Smith Rocks is volcanic. It is made up of layers of recent basalt flows overlaying older Clarno ash and tuff formations. Approximately 30 million years ago, a large caldera was formed when overlying rock collapsed into an underground lava chamber. This created a huge amount of rock and ash debris that filled the caldera. That material solidified into rock, becoming Smith Rock tuff. Rhyolite flows intruded along faults in the Smith Rock Tuff. A half million years ago, basalt lava flows from nearby volcanoes covered the older tuff.\n\nMore recently, the Crooked River cut its way through the layers of rock to create today's geographic features. Smith Rock itself is a -high ridge (above sea level) with a sheer cliff-face overlooking a bend in the Crooked River (elev. 2600 ft), making the cliffs about 600 feet high.\n\nThe origin of the Smith Rock name is uncertain. One story, published the Albany \"States Rights Democrat\" in 1867, states that Smith Rock was named after John Smith, who was Linn County Sheriff and an Oregon state legislator in the 1850s and 1860s. The newspaper article credits Smith with \"discovering\" the rock. Another story claims the rock was named after a soldier named Smith who fell to his death from the rock in 1863 while his unit was camped nearby.\n\nThe State of Oregon obtained the park property between 1960 and 1975 from the City of Redmond and Harry and Diane Kem.\n\nThe park has many miles of developed trails for hiking. The trails have viewpoints along the routes that overlook the Crooked River and nearby rock formations. The two main trails are the \"Summit Trail\" and \"Misery Ridge\". The park's trail network links to neighboring Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management trails on adjacent public lands. The soil and native vegetation on the steep hillsides in the park are very sensitive to damage, so visitors are required to stay on established trails.\n\nThe park contains the first U.S. climb rated . The area is well known for its challenging climbing routes and attracts high level climbers. In 1983, Alan Watts began to use sport climbing ethics which pushed American climbing to new levels. Shortly after, between 1992 and 2009, about 500 new climbing routes were added. This brought climbers from all over the world as Smith Rock became the world capital for sport climbing. To this day, the park still attracts climbers from around the globe. The winter weather is typically cold (below freezing), but climbers still make the journey due to the reduced traffic on routes. Summer months regularly reach the 100s °F (40s °C). Some climbing routes are closed periodically for the protection of nesting birds of prey.\n\nSmith Rock State Park has more than 1,800 rock climbing routes as of 2010. The park is broken up into walls and have names commonly used by the climbing community.\n\nThe Christian Brothers area is a large group of rock spires in between Asterisk Pass and The Dihedrals. The walls that make up the Christian Brothers area are the Prophet Wall, The Beard, Testament Slab and the Combination Blocks. There are several routes in this area that are noteworthy such as Wartley's Revenge (5.11b Trad), Revelations (5.9 Sport) with its high first bolt off the ground, Double Trouble (5.10b Sport), BBQ the Pope (5.10b Sport), Heresy (5.11c Sport), Rude Boys (5.13c Sport), and Scarface and Chemical Ali (both 5.14a Sport).\n\nThe Dihedrals are located between the Four Horseman and Asterisk Pass just pass the Morning Glory Wall. It is one of the more popular areas to climb in the park with easy classics like Cinnamon Slab (5.6 Trad, 2 Pitch), Bunny Face (5.7 Sport). It has some more moderate climbs of high quality such as Moonshine Dihedral (5.9 Trad, 2 Pitch) and Karate Crack (5.10a Trad) as well some of the more difficult and famous climbs such as Heinous Cling (5.12c Sport), Chain Reaction (5.12c Sport) and To Bolt or Not to Be (5.14a Sport).\n\nThe Gorge contains more climbs that are Traditional Routes rather than Sport Routes. Climbers also need to be fairly stout climbers as most routes start in the low 5.12's.\nThe rock is mainly basalt, fairly different from the welded tuff you find in most of the other climbing areas in Smith Rock State Park. The lower gorge is a location to get away from the heat of the late spring, summer and early fall.\n\nThe Marsupials are the farthest climbing area from the main entrance of the park. To get there, go across the bridge and turn right on Wolf Tree Trail. Follow this around the canyon following the Crooked River and turn up Burma Road. The beginning of the Marsupials starts just off Burma Road. The three main areas in the Marsupials are Koala Rock, The Wombat and Brogan Spire.\n\nFamed climber Beth Rodden made the first female ascent of The Optimist (5.14b Sport) located on the \"Koala Rock\" side of the Marsupials.\n\nThe Monkey Face area has many routes, but is known for the iconic rock spire known as \"Monkey Face,\" a distinctly primate looking face when viewed from certain angles. This iconic tower is 350 feet tall and boasts many routes. One of the more famous routes, Just Do It (5.14c), is still a testpiece for climbers to prove their prowess.\n\nDirectly across from the \"mouth\" of Monkey Face is a prominent rock outcropping (The Diving Board) that comes fairly close to the tower. There is tyrollean traverse gear nailed down on the outcropping and within the \"mouth\" of Monkey Face. Adventurous climbers can connect these with 1\" nylon webbing and create a \"slackline\" between the two locations. The idea is to tether yourself with a safety line to the slackline and then walk out over the expanse of open air keeping your balance.\n\nThe Morning Glory Wall sits in just past the Shiprock and is one of the busier walls in the park. It boasts routes of all levels. Because of its location, it is very hot in the late morning and afternoons during the warmer seasons. The Morning Glory Wall a wide range of climbs but some of the more notable routes are 5 Gallon Buckets (5.8), Light on the Path (5.10a), Cool Ranch Flavor (5.11b), Magic Light (5.11b), Zebra Seam (5.11d), Churning in the Wake (5.13a) and Vicious Fish (5.13c).\n\nThe Picnic Lunch Wall is generally the first image of Smith Rock State Park that most visitors get. It is 700 feet tall and has climbing routes, many multi-pitch routes that have loose rock. It is also the beginning of the Misery Ridge, Wolf Tree, and River Trails and generally gets heavy hiking traffic.\n\nThe Red Wall is located off the Misery Ridge Trail just pass the Picnic Lunch Wall. The rock has a red to purple color to it from the iron in the rock making it distinct from most of the rest of the welded tuft in the park. It has some classic, easy multi-pitch trad climbs with Superslab (5.6 trad, 3 pitches), Moscow (5.6 trad, 3 pitches with one 4th class scramble at the top), and Peking (5.8 trad, 3 pitches). Because it is an east-facing wall, the early morning gets the sun directly on it for colder days and shade in the afternoon/evening for the warmer days.\n\nThe Rope-De-Dope block sits across the Crooked River across from the main climbing areas such as The Morning Glory Wall. The trail to Rope-De-Dope is the gravel Canyon Trail and goes north before you walk across the main bridge into the park. If you are starting from The Bivy, take the Rope-de-Dope Trail that comes around the back of the block. The Rope-De-Dope Block is a common place for beginners to be able to top-rope or learn how to lead climb on easier routes. The routes on Rope-De-Dope are shorter than almost all of the other routes in the park due to the block only being 40 feet high. Top ropes can be set up from a small scramble up the back of the block to get to the top anchors.\n\nThe Ships and Gullies area is a collection of smaller, in-the-shade areas that have a range of climbing difficulties. This area contains Aggro Gully, Cocaine Gully, Honeycomb Wall, Shipwreck Wall, Table Scraps Wall, and West Ship River Face. The Ships and Gullies area starts less than a quarter of a mile past the Picnic Lunch Wall after Shiprock where you can see the first set of stairs up the trail to the gullies.\n\nThe Smith Rock Groups cover a large swath of the climbing park stretching from Asterisk Pass to the southern border of the park. Generally, these can be areas to get away from the crowds and the sun. The Smith Rock Group has a lot of varied climbing but mostly sport with a couple of options for multi-pitch. Some of the more popular routes are Sky Ridge (5.8 trad, 3 pitches), Sunset Slab (5.9 sport), White Satin (5.9 trad, 3 pitches), Wherever I May Roam (5.9 sport, 5 pitches), Phoenix (5.10a sport), Kunza Korner (5.10c sport), American Nirvana (5.11c sport), and Blackened (5.11c/d).\n\nThe West Side Crags offer a much cooler side of the park in the summer and a break from the normally fairly crowded sections of the park. There are three ways to get to the West Side Crags depending upon how much hiking/scrambling you are willing to do. The most direct route is to hike to Asterisk Pass from the main trail into the park just west of The Christian Brothers area. It is a scramble to get into the slot and then it is a 5.7R down-climb from the other side of the path to the west side of the park. This can be dangerous if done without climbing equipment and experience. The West Side Crags can also be accessed from either hiking up Misery Ridge and access the crags after coming down the switchbacks at Monkey Face or take the longer River Trail around the southern tip and then walk up to the crags. The West Side Crags are composed of Snake Rock, Angel Flight Crags, Spiderman Buttress, Mesa Verda Wall and the Pleasure Palace.\n\nThe park's day-use area has a visitor center, picnic facilities, and restrooms. The day-use area is open from dawn to dusk year-round. There is also a tent-only campground for overnight visitors. The campsites are located approximately from a parking area along the park's main access road. Restrooms, showers, and a cooking area are located near the parking area. Open fires are not permitted. Many of the state park campers will stay at Skull Hollow, a nearby BLM camp ground.\n\nThere is abundant wildlife in and around the park. Mule deer and many small mammals are common in the park. river otter and beaver are found along the park's Crooked River frontage. The Smith Rock area hosts many types of birds like the canyon wren and the white-throated swift, including birds of prey such as prairie falcons and golden eagles. Geese and ducks nest along the river in the spring time. There are rattlesnakes in some areas of the park.\n\nSmith Rock State Park is home to some extreme running races. The races include distances ranging from 4 miles to 50 miles, all on the challenging and hilly terrain of Smith Rock.\n\n\n"}

Lund was often credited as being the first Finnish player in the National Hockey League. (Albert Pudas, however, played 4 games with the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1926-1927).\n\nLund moved to Canada from Finland at the age of six. He began his junior career with the local Port Arthur teams in the Thunder Bay Junior A Hockey League from 1942 to 1945. Lund lead the league in scoring during his two seasons with the Navy team, where, in 19 regular season games, he scored an impressive 47 goals.\n\nLund turned pro in 1945–46 with the Boston Olympics of the Eastern Hockey League, a minor affiliate team of the Boston Bruins. He scored 33 points during the regular season and scored 15 points in 9 playoff games with the Olympics helping the team win a championship. Next season, Lund led the league in scoring with 92 points in 56 games. This helped him garner some fame as he was called up by the Boston Bruins in the National Hockey League to play in one playoff game. In 1947-48, Lund joined the Hershey Bears in the American Hockey League where his excellent play was rewarded with two playoff game appearances with the Boston Bruins.\n\nDuring the off-season, Lund was traded to the New York Rangers, where he won the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year by scoring 14 goals and adding 16 assists in 59 games. He also became the first Finnish-born player to score a goal in the NHL. In his second year with the Rangers, he scored a career high 18 goals. Lund and the Rangers made a great run to the Stanley Cup Finals as the fourth seeded team. Lund had a great postseason as he recorded 11 points in 12 games. The Rangers would lose the Stanley Cup to the first-place Detroit Red Wings in seven games.\n\nLund was traded back to the Boston Bruins early in the 1951-52 season. During the season, Lund suffered an eye-injury from a high-stick on November 13, during the 13th game of the season, with Lund skating with number 13 on his jersey, suggesting to many that unlucky number 13 played a role in the injury. The injury was so severe, that he almost lost all sight in his right eye. Lund attempted a comeback after being sidelined for three-months, contributing 17 points with only one eye in 1952-53. Lund would skate for two seasons with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds before retiring from hockey in 1955.\n\nOn September 29, 1984. Lund was inducted into the Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame, and 8 years later, in 1992, was inducted into the Finnish Ice Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nHe died April 16, 2013 at the age of 87.\n\n\n"}

It was written by James Keyes, Claude Feaster, Carl Feaster, Floyd F. McRae, and William Edwards, members of the R&B vocal group the Chords, and published in 1954. It was a U.S. top-10 hit that year for both the Chords (who first recorded the song) and the Crew-Cuts.\n\nThe song was first recorded on Atlantic Records' subsidiary label Cat Records by the Chords on March 15, 1954, and would be their only hit song. \"Sh-Boom\" reached No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" R&B charts and peaked at No. 9 on the pop charts. It is sometimes considered to be the first doo-wop or rock 'n' roll record to reach the top ten on the pop charts (as opposed to the R&B charts). This version was ranked No. 215 on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and is the group's only song on the list.\n\nA more traditional version was made by a Canadian group, the Crew-Cuts (with the David Carroll Orchestra), for Mercury Records and was No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" charts for nine weeks during August and September 1954. The single first entered the charts on July 30, 1954, and stayed for 20 weeks. The Crew-Cuts performed the song on Ed Sullivan's \"Toast of the Town\" on December 12, 1954. On the \"Cash Box\" magazine best-selling record charts, where both versions were combined, the song reached No. 1.\n\nStan Freberg recorded a combined spoof of \"Sh-boom\" and Marlon Brando because he felt that they both mumbled, in 1954. It reached No. 14 in the US and 15 in the UK. The Billy Williams Quartet released a version in 1954 on Coral Records that reached No. 21 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, with orchestra directed by Jack Pleis. A recording by Ken Mackintosh and His Orchestra (vocalists: the Mackpies) was made in London on April 7, 1954. It was released by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalog number B 10698.\n\nThe record for most recordings of \"Sh-Boom\" by a single group probably belongs to the Harvard Din & Tonics, an \"a cappella\" men's singing group that has featured the song on 12 of their 13 albums. Their 1979 Crew-Cuts-style arrangement was so popular that the group began performing \"Sh-Boom\" as their signature song at all their concerts, bringing all their alumni onstage to perform it across the United States and through 10 world tours.\n\nThe British Doo-Wop revivalists, Darts, recorded \"Sh-Boom\" in the late 1970s, this time at a slower tempo. It was released as the B-side of the band's last charting single, reaching No. 48 in the UK charts in 1980.\n\nThe reggae crooner Alton Ellis recorded a cover entitled \"She Boom\" for Studio One some time in the 1970s; the EP has been pressed at various times by various distributors.\n\nIn the 1980s a parody of the song entitled \"Dubuque\" was featured in the Dubuque ham TV commercial, a midwestern-based meat packing company.\n\nGerman rock-and-roll band Spider Murphy Gang adapted the song into a Bavarian version, \"Leben is wiar a Traum\", which they released as a single in 1985.\n\nThe Fleetwoods released a cover version of the song. Canadian children's entertainers Sharon, Lois & Bram covered the song on their 1995 album release titled \"Let's Dance!\". Watkin Tudor Jones covered the song on his 2001 album, \"Memoirs Of A Clone.\" British doo-wop act the Overtones covered the song on their 2010 album \"Good Ol' Fashioned Love\". The song was covered in 1955 by Enoch Light And His Light Brigade Orchestra, released in the UK on His Master's Voice, and appears on their album \"Little Things Mean A Lot\" from Jasmine Records.\n\nAlternate recordings based on the Crew Cuts' recording were heard in the TV series \"Happy Days\" (1974–84) and in the film \"Clue\" (1985). The original Chords' recording was featured in \"The Super\" (1991), \"Liberty Heights\" (1999), \"The Sum of Us\" (1994), \"Cry-Baby\" featuring Johnny Depp (1990), \"Two of Us\" (2000), \"Road House\" (1989), and the mini-series \"Lipstick on Your Collar\" (1993). It was briefly featured in the HBO mini-series \"From the Earth To The Moon\" (1998) and the movie \"Hearts in Atlantis\" (2001). The Trevor Horn Orchestra covered the song for the \"Mona Lisa Smile\" (2003) soundtrack. Pixar's \"Cars\" used a long recording of the song (2006), and Disney California Adventure prominently incorporated it into the nightly neon lighting ceremony in the new Cars Land. It is heard in the 2011 film \"Dolphin Tale\". The song is briefly featured in a Nexgard Chewables for Dogs commercial.\n\nA remixed version by Junkie XL is featured in the video game \"Destroy All Humans!\". New York television personality Clay Cole wrote about the early years of rock 'n' roll and live television in his memoirs, \"Sh-Boom! The Explosion of Rock 'n' Roll (1953–1968)\", published by Morgan James Books. \"Sh-Boom\" was parodied by Stan Freberg. Another parody, as a singing Lucky Strike cigarette commercial by the Sportsmen Quartet, appeared on the October 31, 1954, Jack Benny radio show. Comic Ronnie Golden wrote a parody, \"Shoe Bomb,\" on the subject of the British terrorist Richard Reid. The song appeared in the video game \"Mafia II\" (2010).\n\nThe Crew Cuts version was heard in the game show \"Trapped!\" in the challenge Wicked Wardrobes.\n\nMost recently, \"Sh-Boom\" was referenced by Robert De Niro in his role of Bernie Madoff in the 2017 HBO-produced movie \"The Wizard of Lies\". After De Niro tells an anecdote about the song, it serves as background music during an early scene prior to Bernie Madoff's confession to his family and the disclosure of his crimes.\n"}
{"id": "1920997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920997", "title": "Harrod–Domar model", "text": "Harrod–Domar model\n\nThe Harrod–Domar model is a Keynesian model of economic growth. It is used in development economics to explain an economy's growth rate in terms of the level of saving and of capital. It suggests that there is no natural reason for an economy to have balanced growth. The model was developed independently by Roy F. Harrod in 1939, and Evsey Domar in 1946, although a similar model had been proposed by Gustav Cassel in 1924. The Harrod–Domar model was the precursor to the exogenous growth model.\n\nNeoclassical economists claimed shortcomings in the Harrod–Domar model—in particular the instability of its solution—and, by the late 1950s, started an academic dialogue that led to the development of the Solow–Swan model.\n\nAccording to the Harrod–Domar model there are three kinds of growth: warranted growth, actual growth and natural rate of growth.\n\nWarranted growth rate is the rate of growth at which the economy does not expand indefinitely or go into recession. Actual growth is the real rate increase in a country's GDP per year. (See also: Gross domestic product and Natural gross domestic product). Natural growth is the growth an economy requires to maintain full employment. For example, If the labor force grows at 3 percent per year, then to maintain full employment, the economy’s annual growth rate must be 3 percent.\n\nLet \"Y\" represent output, which equals income, and let \"K\" equal the capital stock. \"S\" is total saving, \"s\" is the savings rate, and \"I\" is investment. \"δ\" stands for the rate of depreciation of the capital stock. The Harrod–Domar model makes the following \"a priori\" assumptions:\nDerivation of output growth rate:\n\nA derivation with calculus is as follows, using dot notation (for example, formula_2) for the derivative of a variable with respect to time.\n\nFirst, assumptions (1)–(3) imply that output and capital are linearly related (for readers with an economics background, this proportionality implies a capital-elasticity of output equal to unity). These assumptions thus generate equal growth rates between the two variables. That is,\n\nSince the marginal product of capital, \"c\", is a constant, we have\n\nNext, with assumptions (4) and (5), we can find capital's growth rate as,\n\nIn summation, the savings rate times the marginal product of capital minus the depreciation rate equals the output growth rate. Increasing the savings rate, increasing the marginal product of capital, or decreasing the depreciation rate will increase the growth rate of output; these are the means to achieve growth in the Harrod–Domar model.\n\nAlthough the Harrod–Domar model was initially created to help analyse the business cycle, it was later adapted to explain economic growth. Its implications were that growth depends on the quantity of labour and capital; more investment leads to capital accumulation, which generates economic growth. The model carries implications for less economically developed countries, where labour is in plentiful supply in these countries but physical capital is not, slowing down economic progress. LDCs do not have sufficiently high incomes to enable sufficient rates of saving; therefore, accumulation of physical-capital stock through investment is low.\n\nThe model implies that economic growth depends on policies to increase investment, by increasing saving, and using that investment more efficiently through technological advances.\n\nThe model concludes that an economy does not \"naturally\" find full employment and stable growth rates.\n\nThe main criticism of the model is the level of assumption, one being that there is no reason for growth to be sufficient to maintain full employment; this is based on the belief that the relative price of labour and capital is fixed, and that they are used in equal proportions. The model also assumes that savings rates are constant, which may not be true, and assumes that the marginal returns to capital are constant. Furthermore, the model has been criticized for the assumption that productive capacity is proportional to capital stock, which Domar later stated was not a realistic assumption. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1921000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921000", "title": "Schule Schloss Salem", "text": "Schule Schloss Salem\n\nSchule Schloss Salem (Anglicisation: \"School of Salem Castle\", \"Salem Castle School\") is a boarding school with campuses in Salem and Überlingen in Baden-Württemberg, Southern Germany. It is considered one of the most elite schools in Europe.\n\nIt offers the German Abitur, as well as the International Baccalaureate (IB). With a scholarship program and its \"Dienste\" (Services) such as the Firebrigade, the \"Technisches Hilfswerk\" short: THW (Technical Support Organisation), the First Aid or the Nautical Service. The Schule Schloss Salem, also commonly referred to as Salem College, hence offers an education for its students at the academic as well as social levels.\n\nThe school was established by the educator Kurt Hahn with support of Prince Maximilian of Baden in 1920 and from the beginning accepted girls and boys. Under the Nazi regime Hahn (who was Jewish) was forced to emigrate to Scotland where he founded the British Salem School of Gordonstoun as well as later Outward Bound and the United World Colleges.\n\nThe school’s mission continues to reflect its Hahnian roots. Specifically, Salem aims to present young people with high academic and extracurricular expectations and opportunities; and to introduce them to a lifelong sense of respect for the individual, responsibility to the community and an awareness of the importance of the democratic process in sustaining both.\n\nThe academic program in Years 5–7 is in German. Intensive instruction in German as a foreign language is available for international pupils. Even pupils arriving at the School with no German are fluent within one school year.\n\nFrom Year 8 onward, Salem is fully bilingual and offers a dual curriculum. Students may either continue in the German system (Abitur) or enter the international classes & the IB Diploma Programme, in which the language is English. However, students may switch systems until they enter the upper school. Approximately a third of the students in the upper years are in the IB system. Most students are of German background, but there is significant population of international students, with students attending from a variety of countries such as Switzerland, Spain, USA, China, Russia, Korea, India, Canada, Australia or Italy.\n\nAt Salem, involvement in extracurricular activities and the life in the boarding community and academic achievement are equally emphasized. All students in the upper years must engage in community service such as Nautical Service, THW (Technical Support Organisation) extended First Aid, Community Service (Kindergarten, Disabled people's home, etc.) or Fire brigade at least one afternoon per week. During the terrible aeroplane accident of 2002 in Überlingen, Salem Students were some of the first at the scene. All students must also participate in a regular program of sports and/or outdoor pursuits such as Outward Bound, Football, Rugby or Gymnastics. Participation in theatre, music and visual-arts extracurricular programs, while not mandatory, is strongly encouraged. The student orchestra in Salem is regarded to be one of the foremost youth-orchestra's in Germany and travels around the world to perform its music, such as a recent trip to Beijing, China.\n\nFar more than in boarding schools from the Anglo-American tradition, responsibility for the everyday running of the School in the upper years is, in keeping with Salem’s democratic ethos based on the principles of Kurt Hahn, placed in the hands of students under the guidance of staff. All activities and dormitories (Flügel) are led by students elected by their peers. School regulations are outlined with the consent of the student parliament and breaches of these are jointly dealt with by the School administration and the elected leaders of the student body in what is called the \"Leitungsrat\" or the 'Leadership Council', which comprises the Headmaster of the College, the two Head Boys/Girls, the students housemaster/mistress and other senior staff members.\n\nIn 2013 the one-year interdisciplinary Salem Kolleg was opened in Überlingen. The autonomously operated Studium generale programme prepares high school graduates for their academic and professional future through an orientation year of three trimesters during which trained advisors provide intensive career counseling, personal assessment with the help of assessment tests such as the Holland Codes, and outdoor leadership courses. The programme shares many of the facilities of Salem International College on the Härlen campus in Überlingen. The founding director was Gerhard Teufel, former director of the \"German Academic Scholarship Foundation\" (\"Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes\").\n\nBeginning with school year 2018/2019 Salem introduced a programme titled \"10 Plus\", which allows students from other academic tracks to achieve a full-accredited Abitur after one supplemental year of high school before entering the so-called \"Kollegstufe\" (Years 11 and 12), the equivalent of the British Sixth form.\n\nApproximately one-third of pupils receive financial aid through various scholarship programmes, the distribution of which is based upon both need and merit. University admissions are excellent, with almost all graduates eventually attending the most selective universities in Germany, Great Britain and the leading Commonwealth countries, as well as the United States.\nSalem is spread among three separate campuses: the Lower School (grades 5 to 7) and the Middle School in Salem Castle (grades 8 to 11, and Pre-IB), and the 'Upper' (secondary) School in \"Spetzgart\" Castle and the new campus of \"Härlen\" (Grades 11 and 12, IB years 1 and 2). The Lower School was located in ′′Schloss Hohenfels′′, an isolated castle above the town of Kalkofen 20 kilometers to the west of Salem, until the end of school year 2016/17. Salem Castle is located in a former Cistercian monastery, which prior to secularisation in 1802-1803 was known as Salem Abbey, in the town of Salem. The Upper School is located along the shores of Lake Constance on the outskirts of Überlingen in Spetzgart Castle (since 1928) and on the modern Härlen campus, which was opened in September 2000.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1921004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921004", "title": "Pierre Pilote", "text": "Pierre Pilote\n\nJoseph Albert Pierre Paul Pilote (December 11, 1931 – September 9, 2017) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman and perennial All-Star, most notably for the Chicago Black Hawks of the National Hockey League (NHL), for which he served as team captain for seven seasons.\n\nBorn in Kenogami, Quebec, Pilote's family moved to Fort Erie, Ontario, when he was 14 years old. Because the local rink collapsed in a storm, Pilote did not play his first organized hockey game until he was 17. He tried out with a Niagara Falls junior B team as a centre, but was turned down because the club needed a defenceman instead. Pilote practiced as a defenceman and joined the team the following season.\n\nRudy Pilous recruited Pilote to the St. Catharines Teepees of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA); he made the team out of training camp in 1950. Pilote played four full seasons for the minor professional club the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League (AHL). During his fifth season, he was signed by the Chicago Black Hawks of the National Hockey League (NHL), starting his professional career.\n\nPilote became a preeminent star for the Black Hawks, winning the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the NHL's most outstanding defenceman three straight seasons in 1963, 1964 and 1965 — a feat matched or surpassed only by Doug Harvey, Bobby Orr and Nicklas Lidström in NHL history — as well as runner-up in 1962, 1966 and 1967. He was on the First or Second All-Star Team every year from 1960 to 1967. Pilote had an iron man streak of playing 376 consecutive games over more than five seasons. He was often paired with Elmer \"Moose\" Vasko on the Chicago blue line.\n\nIn 1961, the Black Hawks won the Stanley Cup. During the off-season, team captain Ed Litzenberger was traded and Pilote was named the new captain. He held this role with the team until traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1968 for forward Jim Pappin; his seven-season tenure as captain was, until surpassed by current team captain Jonathan Toews in the 2016–17 NHL season, the longest in franchise history.\n\nPilote played one season with the Leafs before retiring. He played his last game on April 6, 1969, finishing his career with 80 goals and 418 assists in 890 games.\n\nAt the time of his retirement, Pilote was the second leading defence scorer in NHL history (behind Harvey), as well as the sixth leading career scorer for the Black Hawks and second in all-time assists behind Stan Mikita. He remains eighth in all-time assists for the Hawks.\n\nPilote was inducted in the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1975. In 1997, he was ranked number 59 on \"The Hockey News\"' list of the 100 greatest hockey players.\n\nOn July 18, 2008, the Blackhawks announced that the #3 jersey worn by Pilote and Keith Magnuson would be retired in a joint ceremony, the sixth number so honoured by the club.

The plot centres on Danny, a\nyoung English boy with a big wagon, and his father, William, who live in a Gypsy caravan fixing cars for a living and partake in poaching pheasants. It was first published in 1975 in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. and in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape.\n\nIt was adapted into a made-for-TV movie in 1989 by Thames Television which starred Jeremy Irons. It is based on Dahl's adult short story \"Champion of the World\" which first appeared in print in \"The New Yorker\" magazine, as did some of the other short stories that would later be reprinted as \"Kiss Kiss\" (1960). Peter Serafinowicz provides the English language audiobook recording. \"Time\" included the novel in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time.\n\nDanny was only four months old when his mother died. At the beginning of the book, he lives with his widowed father, William, in an old caravan behind the service station and garage owned and operated by his father. At the age of nine, Danny learns that his father is an avid poacher, as was his father's father. Shortly thereafter, Danny wakes at 2:10 am to find his father hasn't returned from his latest poaching venture on the property of the local beer magnate, Mr Hazell. Danny drives to the property and finds his father in a trap, incapacitated by a broken ankle. Danny rescues his father and helps him home. While his father recovers from his injury, he and Danny realize Mr. Hazell's annual pheasant shoot is approaching - an event to which he invites wealthy, powerful and influential people. Danny and his father decide to humiliate Mr Hazell by capturing all the pheasants in the forest. To accomplish this, they place the contents of the sleeping pills prescribed to Danny's father by the village doctor, Doc Spencer, into raisins that the pheasants will eat; Danny's father calls this new method \"Sleeping Beauty\".\n\nAfter having successfully captured 120 pheasants from Hazell's Wood, Danny and his father take a taxi (driven by a fellow poacher) to the local vicarage, where they hide the pheasants. Afterwards, they walk home. The next day, the vicar's wife (Mrs Clipstone) delivers the sleeping pheasants to Danny's father's garage in a specially built baby carriage; however, the pheasants start flying out of the baby carriage as the narcotic wears off. The birds do not travel far, as they're still sleepy. During the commotion, Mr. Hazell arrives and confronts Danny, his father and Doc Spencer. With the help of Sergeant Enoch Samways, the village policeman, Danny and his father shoo the stunned pheasants over (and in some cases inside) Mr. Hazell's Rolls Royce, damaging the car's paintwork in the process. As Mr. Hazell leaves disgraced, the pheasants wake up completely and fly away in the opposite direction from Hazell's property. The book ends when Danny is hailed as \"the champion of the world\" by his father, Doc Spencer and Sgt. Samways. Six pheasants died of a sleeping pill overdose, so Doc Spencer gives two each to Sgt Samways, Mrs Clipstone and Danny and his father. Danny and his father then walk into town, intending to buy a new oven to cook their pheasants. They also discuss possibly attempting to poach trout from a local stream.\n\nThe book was adapted into a made-for-TV movie in 1989 by Thames Television. It was directed by Gavin Millar and starred Jeremy Irons as William and his son, Samuel, as Danny, with Robbie Coltrane as Mr. Hazell. It was released to Region 2 DVD in 2006.\n\n\"Danny, The Champion of the World\" is based on a previous short story by Dahl, entitled \"The Champion of the World\", which was first published in \"The New Yorker Magazine\" in 1959 and later re-published in the compilation \"Kiss Kiss\". The original story has a similar premise, but with adults as the main characters.\n\nWilliam tells Danny a bedtime story sequence of a \"Big Friendly Giant\" who captures good dreams and blows them into children's bedrooms at night. Dahl would later use the same concept in the full-length novel entitled \"The BFG\".\n\nDanny describes being caned by his teacher, Captain Lancaster, for cheating in an exam. This is similar to an experience that Dahl recounted of his own teacher, Captain Hardcastle, in \"\".\n\n"}

He was honored in 1991 as the Frank J. Selke Trophy winner for outstanding defensive play by a forward. Graham served as head coach of the Blackhawks during the 1998–99 season before being relieved of his duties after 59 games. Graham was the first NHL captain of African descent.\n\nGraham was selected 89th overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 1979 NHL Entry Draft after spending four years with the Regina Pats in the Western Hockey League. Graham spent four years in the minor leagues which included the International Hockey League and the Central Hockey League. In 1980–81, Graham scored 40 goals with the Toledo Goaldiggers of the IHL, and he was named to the second all-star team. In 1982–83, he scored 70 goals with the Goaldiggers and was named to the first all-star team. This caught the attention of some, and he was signed as a free agent by the Minnesota North Stars after never playing a game with the Canucks. Graham spent two more years developing in the American Hockey League and Central Hockey League. He was selected to the CHL First All-Star Team in 1983–84. In 1985–86, Graham was playing full-time with the North Stars. He recorded consecutive 20 goal seasons in Minnesota and was chosen to represent Team Canada in the 1987 World Ice Hockey Championships. On January 2, 1988, Graham was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks for Curt Fraser.\n\nGraham played his best hockey in Chicago. In his first full season with the Blackhawks (1988-89), Graham topped the 30 goal mark for the first time in his career and finished with a career high 78 points (A stunning 10 of his 33 goals were short-handed; thus he joins Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, and Marcel Dionne as one of only four players to achieve ten or more short-handed goals in a season). He scored 20 goals or more four times with the Blackhawks. \n\nIn 1990–91, he won the Frank J. Selke Trophy for best defensive forward in the league and represented Team Canada in the Canada Cup tournament. Canada would beat the United States to take first place. Late in 1988–89, Graham was named team captain (replacing Denis Savard), the first player of African descent to become team captain in the National Hockey League. He captained the team all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1991–92, where they were swept by the Pittsburgh Penguins. Graham retired in 1995 after the lockout shortened season.\n\nShortly after retiring, Graham served as assistant coach for Craig Hartsburg with the Chicago Blackhawks. Graham took a year off, then returned as a scout for the Chicago Blackhawks. He served briefly as a head coach in 1998–99 until he was replaced by Lorne Molleken. He is currently a scout for the San Jose Sharks.\n\n\n \n"}

An eagle overhead bears the state motto.\n\nThe Seal of Iowa is described carefully under Iowa Code 1A.1 in the following: \"\"The secretary of state be, and is, hereby authorized to procure a seal which shall be the great seal of the state of Iowa, two inches in diameter, upon which shall be engraved the following device, surrounded by the words, 'The Great Seal of the State of Iowa' - a sheaf and field of standing wheat, with a sickle and other farming utensils, on the left side near the bottom; a lead furnace and pile of pig lead on the right side; the citizen soldier, with a plow in his rear, supporting the American flag and liberty cap with his right hand, and his gun with his left, in the center and near the bottom; the Mississippi River in the rear of the whole, with the steamer Iowa under way; an eagle near the upper edge, holding in his beak a scroll, with the following inscription upon it: Our liberties we prize, and our rights we will maintain.\"\"\n\nIt was approved by the First Iowa General Assembly on February 25, 1847. Since that date, there have been no revisions to the code governing this Seal. The Seal of Iowa is kept and used by the Governor for official purposes. Because the seal was not illustrated in the Iowa code, over the years there have been several variations with differences in color and arrangement of objects.\n\nThe seal was not universally beloved when introduced, it was considered cluttered and ungainly, and the older Territorial Seal was utilized in several instances on official publications into the 1860s, including official currency. \"Gov. Lowe, who, with every other gentleman of refinement, cannot but regret the bad taste that conceived and adopted the conglomerate devices of our present 'Great Seal'.\"\n\nThe symbols presented on the seal reflect things important to early Iowa settlers.\n\n\n\nConcerned about portraying members of the Iowa National Guard in a poor light, in 2010 Rep. Ray Zirkelbach, a state legislator, recommended changing the text \"the citizen soldier, with a plow in his rear\" to \"the citizen soldier, standing in front of a plow” because \"in his rear\" is considered a malapropism. His proposal was not considered in 2010 because of time constraints.\n\nThe state seal supplanted the Iowa Territory seal (1838–1846), which consisted of a Federal eagle holding an arrow in its mouth and a bow in its talon. \"The Seal of Iowa contains the following simple device: An Eagle In the attitude of flight grasping in its dexter talon a Bow and holding in its beak an arrow. Around the border of the seal are the words, SEAL OF THE TERRITORY OF IOWA.\" The territorial seal was the basis for other state seals, including the first seal of the University of Iowa and the State Historical Society of Iowa, as well as the Civil War Arms of Iowa; these later seals had the bow held in the left talon, rather than the right.\n\nThe Territorial seal was well liked as a simple image of the state and was used on state documents well into the 1860s, even after it had been officially replaced. \"It is regarded as perfectly expressive of a distinct idea, intimately associated with the history of the delightful country which we have the happiness to inhabit... The slightest examination of the seal will disclose to the Honorable Council the eagle, the proud and appropriate emblem of our national power, bearing in its beak an Indian arrow, and clutching in its talons an unstrung bow; and while the idea thus delicately evolved is so well calculated to make the eye glisten with patriotic pride, and cause the heart to beat high with the pulsations of conscious superiority, it nevertheless presents a touching appeal to our manly sensibilities.\"\n\n\n"}

In the 1930s, Bergeron and W. Findeisen developed the concept that clouds contain both supercooled water and ice crystals. According to Bergeron, most precipitation is formed as a consequence of water evaporating from small supercooled droplets and accreting onto ice crystals, which then fall as snow, or melt and fall as cold rain depending on the ambient air temperature. This process is known as the Bergeron Process, and is believed to be the primary process by which precipitation is formed.\n\nBergeron was one of the principal scientists in the Bergen School of Meteorology, which transformed this science by introducing a new conceptual foundation for understanding and predicting weather. While developing innovative methods of forecasting, the Bergen scientists established the notion of weather fronts and elaborated a new model of extratropical cyclones that accounted for their birth, growth, and decay. Bergeron is credited with discovering the occlusion process, which marks the final stage in the life cycle of an extratropical cyclone.\n\nIn 1949 he was awarded the Symons Gold Medal of the Royal Meteorological Society. \nIn 1966 he was awarded the prestigious International Meteorological Organization Prize from the World Meteorological Organization.\n\n"}

He was the Chief Minister of West Bengal from 2000 to 2011. He was the MLA of Jadavpur constituency for twenty-four years until 13 May 2011, when he was historically defeated by the former Chief Secretary of his own government, Manish Gupta, by 16,684 votes in the 2011 West Bengal election. He is the second West Bengal Chief Minister to lose an election from his own constituency, after Prafulla Chandra Sen in 1967.\n\nEvents during his tenure as Chief Minister included attempts to industrialise West Bengal thwarted by the TATA's Tata Motors leaving Bengal in the face of relentless opposition by Trinamool congress, the land acquisition dispute in Singur, the Nandigram incident, and the Netai incident.\n\nBorn in 1944 in north Calcutta, Bhattacharjee belongs to a family which had produced another famous son. Revolutionary poet Sukanta Bhattacharya was his father's cousin. A former student of Sailendra Sirkar Vidyalaya. Bhattacharjee had his ancestral house in Bangladesh. He studied Bengali literature at the Presidency College, Kolkata, and secured his B.A degree in Bengali (Honours), later he joined the CPI(M) as a primary member. Besides taking active part in the food movement, he also supported Vietnam's cause in 1968. He was appointed state secretary of the Democratic Youth Federation, the youth wing of the CPI(M) that was later merged into the Democratic Youth Federation of India.\n\nIn 1977, Bhattacharjee was elected as a Legislative Assembly Member for the first time. His constituency then was Cossipore. It was the first time that the CPI(M)-led Left Front came to power in West Bengal. He was given charge of the ministry of information and culture; it was his favourite position and during his tenure he contributed to Bengali theatre, movies and music. After losing the 1982 assembly election from Cossipore, he changed his constituency to Jadavpur in 1987. The move was successful; he won comfortably and regained his post.\n\nBhattacharjee is also known to be a passionate cricket fan. An avid traveller, he has toured extensively in China, the erstwhile Soviet Union, Cuba, Vietnam, Great Britain, France and Singapore. Bhattacharyya and his wife Meera have a daughter, Suchetana who is an environment and wildlife activist. He has refused to move to the designated residence of Chief Minister in honour of party patriarch Jyoti Basu and continued working from his one bed-room Lower Income Group government quarter at Palm Avenue, Kolkata.\n\nIn 1993, Buddhadeb tendered his resignation from the state cabinet due to a significant difference of opinion with Jyoti Basu. However, there has never been any conclusive evidence on reasons behind his leaving the cabinet and party's decision to bring him back within a couple of years. It is during this period, Buddhadeb has written a critique of poetry written by Jibanananda Das, the legendary bengalee poet named \"Hridayer Shabdoheen Jyotsna-r Bhitor\".\n\nNot only did the two leaders (Jyoti Basu and Bhattacharjee) become closer during this period, Bhattacharjee also matured as a politician. He was considered to be one of the few leaders who was both moderate and efficient and could balance both the hardliners and liberals in the party, and therefore, beginning in 1996, he was always considered a viable alternative to Basu.\n\nThis eventually led to his being promoted the Chief Minister, when Basu finally decided to step down in 2000, ahead of the State Assembly elections due in May 2001. Though Basu was ill and aged, his government was fast losing popularity. There were substantiated media stories about corruption involving Basu's son, and the state economy was generally losing steam. There was an investment flight away from the state, increased joblessness in urban areas, a serious crunch in technical and medical education facilities and a near-breakdown of health services at the time. Bhattacharjee was made the Chief Minister with the objective of making the administration look cleaner (he is seen as 'uncorruptible' to this day even by his critics) and more efficient. His clean image was primarily responsible for winning a record 6th term for the Left Front government in West Bengal in May 2001, though with a much reduced majority. He was inducted into the Politburo at the 17th party congress organised in 2002.\n\nAfter becoming the chief minister, Bhattacharjee liberalized Bengal's economy significantly and attracted a lot of foreign investment in Bengal. Many new industries and information technology related services emerged under his leadership. He was generally seen as a Communist leader who was open to reforms. However, his opponents criticized him for taking farmlands to build industries. Bhattacharjee countered that these farmlands were not too productive; they would provide higher-paying jobs to many poor farmers. Some communists have also criticized Bhattacharjee for pursuing economic reforms. Bhattacharjee said that he did not want to unionize the IT industry. Labour unions of Bengal criticized this decision saying that this will lead to the exploitation of IT workers.\n\nHis biggest asset proved to be his clean image, which helped him lead the Left Front to a 7th consecutive term in 2006 Assembly Elections. He personally won from Jadavpur constituency with 127,837 votes. His victory margin went up from 29,281 in 2001 to 58,128 in 2006. His coalition improved its tally from 199 seats (out of 294) to 235 and reduced the other opposition parties to insignificance.\n\nHowever, he took the biggest risk of his political career by embarking upon the industrialization drive to change the face of West Bengal, which had agriculture as primary source of income. He deviated from the standard Marxist doctrine to invite foreign and national capital to set up factories in West Bengal. Notable among them was the world's cheapest car, Tata Nano, from a small hamlet near Kolkata called Singur. There were other proposals too, such as country's largest integrated steel plant in Salboni, West Midanpore district by Jindal group, and a chemical hub at Nayachar after it faced agrarian resistance in Nandigram. However, his plans backfired, and his party, along with its front partners, suffered heavy losses in the 2009 Lok Sabha election. In the 2011 state assembly election he was defeated by the Trinamool congress candidate Manish Gupta by 16,684 votes, and the CPI(M) lost power in the state. He was relieved from his posts on the Politburo and Central Committee at the 21st party congress, organised at Vishakhapatnam in 2015.\n\nIn January 2006 the Supreme Court of India issued notices to Left Front Government ministers including Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and others in relation to land allotments made in the Salt Lake City township in Kolkata.\n\nBuddhadeb Bhattacharjee's Government came under heavy criticism for police action against demonstrators in Nandigram in East Midnapore. He was criticized not only by opposition parties (such as the Trinamool congress, Party of Democratic Socialism, Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation, Communist Revolutionary League of India and others) and other Left Front coalition allies like Communist Party of India, Revolutionary Socialist Party (India) and Forward Bloc, who threatened to back out from the ministry on this issue, but also by his mentor and the state's former chief minister, Jyoti Basu. On March 15, 2007 Basu criticized Bhattacharjee for failing to restrain the police in Nandigram. Bhattacharjee expressed regret for the shootings, but claimed that he permitted police action because Nandigram was an \"area where there had been no rule of law and no presence of an administration for not one, two or 10 days but for two-and-a-half months, and many hundreds of villagers left Nandigram, and took shelter in a state relief camp outside Nandigram.\" Actually Budhhadeb Bhattacharjee declared that land in Nandigram won't be acquired by ordering the Nandigram notification to be torn apart. Still police were not allowed to enter Nandigram. Roads were dug up, preventing administration from entering the area. The CPI(M) declared that they were totally behind Bhattacharjee and had drawn up \"plans\" to placate his critics in the Left Front. His government was also criticized by Left supporters for failing to protect the Left party workers (including his own party CPI(M)) who came under assault from political opponents - both right wing and ultra-left wing Maoists during the post-Nandigram turmoil until the end of 7th Left Front Government.\n\n"}

He is an Honoured Member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nBorn in Montreal, Quebec, Nels Stewart began play as an amateur at age 18 for the Cleveland Indians of the United States Amateur Hockey Association, leading the league in goals scored in four out of the five seasons he played before he and Babe Siebert were signed by the expansion Montreal Maroons of the NHL in 1925.\n\nNicknamed \"Old Poison,\" and with Siebert and veteran stars Clint Benedict, Punch Broadbent and Reg Noble, he would lead the Maroons to the Stanley Cup championship that season. Stewart himself led the league in goal- and point-scoring that year, and became one of the few rookies in history to win the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL's Most Valuable Player.\n\nStewart would later center the legendary \"S Line\", with Hooley Smith and Siebert, and star for the Maroons for seven seasons in all, winning a second Hart Trophy in 1930, having led the league once more with 39 goals in 44 games. As the Great Depression deepened, though, the Maroons had increasing financial problems — eventually folding in 1938 — and sold Stewart to the Boston Bruins for cash. His glittering play continued for the Bruins, finishing second in team scoring each of his three full seasons with the team, despite being moved back to defense a fair bit.\n\nIn 1935 he was traded to the New York Americans, with whom he played for most of his final five seasons in the league. Stewart starred through his penultimate season (in which he was fourth on the Amerks in scoring) with 35 points in 46 games at age 36. The season following, in 1939, his foot speed (never regarded as fast) deserted him entirely. He retired thereafter as the NHL's career leading goal scorer, a mark he set in the 1937 season and held until Maurice Richard broke it in 1952.\n\nOn August 21, 1957, he was found dead at his summer home in Wasaga Beach, Ontario, apparently of natural causes, possibly a heart attack.\n\nStewart was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1952.\n\nIn 1998, he was ranked number 51 on \"The Hockey News\"' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.\n\nHampered throughout his career by sluggish skating ability, which was often mistaken for a lack of effort, Stewart was rarely prone to the end-to-end rushes favoured by the other greats of the 1920s and 30s. Unlike Howie Morenz, Frank Fredrickson or Aurèle Joliat, he resorted to – and perfected – a hard-hitting style of play, with emphasis on collecting rebounds and scoring from bad angles around the crease. Bruins goaltender Tiny Thompson claimed that Stewart was hockey's most dangerous goal scorer around the net – when the latter was 34 years old and near retirement – while Art Ross referred to him as “the greatest inside player in the game”. A few players from previous decades like Pud Glass, similarly lacking in finesse or all-around talent but possessing strength, good balance and a hard shot, had made their living by playing a hard-nosed “garbage-collector” style. However, Stewart was the first to gain superstar status via this mode of play, and he paved the way for future garbage men like Gordie Drillon, Wally Hergesheimer, Phil Esposito and Tim Kerr.\n\nNotwithstanding his reputation as a cumbersome skater, Stewart was used as a defenseman by the Maroons in his rookie season before making the transition to centre. For eight playoff games, including four in the 1926 Finals, Stewart served ably on the back end, where his physical presence and shiftiness kept the opposition hemmed in. His skating was often described as “lazy”, “careless” and “lackadaisical”. Nevertheless, as a defenceman Stewart was able to score 7 of his team's 11 goals during their Finals matchup against the Victoria Cougars, including all four game-winning tallies, and several of his rushes were remarked upon. In general, it appears that Stewart was at worst a middling skater, and at best quite an agile and deceptive one, using “long, swerving strokes” to deke opposing defencemen.\n\nStewart's fame, however, rested squarely on his abilities as a clutch goal scorer around the net. He frequently had multiple-goal games, once marking 4 tallies against the Toronto St. Pats, and was often at the top of the scoring race in his early seasons. This was partially due to his exceptionally hard and “heavy” shot, which was known to have injured several goalies due to its high trajectory. Notably, during the 1928 postseason, a Stewart shot caught Rangers goaltender Lorne Chabot in the left eye, giving him a hemorrhage.\n\nStewart used his shot frequently from close-in, drifting around the crease and waiting patiently to receive a pass before burying it in the net. He had remarkable balance on his skates, as well as tremendous hand-eye coordination. This was demonstrated perfectly in his inaugural Stanley Cup Final against Victoria. In the first game of the series, Stewart was rushing the puck up ice when he was knocked flat by a heavy check from Cougars captain Clem Loughlin. Separated from the puck by five feet and sliding prone across the ice, Stewart nevertheless managed to hook the rubber with his stick and poke it past Victoria goalie Hap Holmes for the leading goal. In the second game, Stewart was body checked by two Victoria players at once. Wildly off-balance, he managed to stay on one foot and fire another hard shot past Holmes.\n\nThereafter, Stewart was notoriously difficult to knock off the puck, and could even propel it into the net one-handed – sometimes by steadying himself on the crossbar with his other hand and much to the irritation of opposing goaltenders. This was aided further by his use of a heavy stick with a lie of 10\", almost L-shaped, enabling him to keep the puck close to his feet.\n\nNotwithstanding Stewart's accuracy and power, his best asset – and one that added to his reputation as a coaster – was an ability to collect rebounds. In the second period of the fourth and deciding game against Victoria in 1926, Stewart joined a rush which saw Hap Holmes stop four shots in rapid succession, all from the left side. With the entire Victoria defence having moved over to block for Holmes, Stewart corralled a rebound, skirted behind the right side of the net and picked the top-left corner with a backhand shot. Sixteen minutes later in the period, he grabbed one of his own rebounds and repeated the feat, again hitting the left corner.\n\nAs a large, heavy centre who used his size and grit to complement his scoring touch, Nels Stewart soon developed a ferocious reputation as both a fighter and an effective pest. He chewed tobacco constantly, and while hovering around the crease would spit the juice into opposing goaltenders’ eyes. Stewart would readily stand up for his teammates, and fought consistently as a result – he led the NHL in penalty minutes with 133 in 1927, edging out famed bruiser Eddie Shore by 3 minutes. He was equally infamous for using his stick to ward off opponents, liberally dishing out two-handed slashes across the wrists and ankles of those whom he felt were being too rough. This resulted in several famous bouts, including one with Hall of Fame defenceman and Maple Leafs strongman Red Horner.\n\nAfter retirement, Stewart spent a period of time coaching the Port Colborne Sailors, where he encountered a young Ted Kennedy in 1942-43. As was the case with Stewart, Kennedy was not a particularly fast skater, but like Stewart he also possessed fine balance and stickhandling ability. Stewart confided in his young trainee that to compensate for his lack of speed, he would need to become an expert playmaker, learning how to work from the corners. He drilled Kennedy prodigiously in passing, as well as how to have an effective net-front presence. These two skillsets would become hallmarks of Kennedy's game, leading him to captaincy of the Maple Leafs, a Stanley Cup dynasty and lasting fame as one of the greatest Leafs to ever play. Stewart's use of an upright lie on his blade also seems to have had an influence on Kennedy, who used a similarly L-shaped stick.\n\n"}
{"id": "1921074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921074", "title": "El Castillo, Chichen Itza", "text": "El Castillo, Chichen Itza\n\nEl Castillo (, Spanish for \"the castle\"), also known as the Temple of Kukulcan (or sometimes Kukulkan), is a Mesoamerican step-pyramid that dominates the center of the Chichen Itza archaeological site in the Mexican state of Yucatán. The building is more formally designated by archaeologists as Chichen Itza Structure 5B18.\n\nBuilt by the pre-Columbian Maya civilization sometime between the 8th and 12th centuries CE or AD, \"El Castillo\" served as a temple to the god Kukulkan, the Yucatec Maya Feathered Serpent deity closely related to the god Quetzalcoatl known to the Aztecs and other central Mexican cultures of the Postclassic period.\n\nThe pyramid consists of a series of square terraces with stairways up each of the four sides to the temple on top. Sculptures of plumed serpents run down the sides of the northern balustrade. Around the spring and autumn equinoxes, the late afternoon sun strikes off the northwest corner of the pyramid and casts a series of triangular shadows against the northwest balustrade, creating the illusion of a feathered serpent \"crawling\" down the pyramid. The event has been very popular and is witnessed by thousands of visitors at the spring equinox, but it is questionable whether it is a result of a purposeful design, because the light-and-shadow effect can be observed, without major changes, during several weeks around the equinoxes. Each of the pyramid's four sides has around 91 steps which, when added together and including the temple platform on top as the final \"step\", may produce a total of 365 steps (the steps on the south side of the pyramid are eroded) (which is equal to the number of days of the \"Haab'\" year).\n\nThe structure is high, plus an additional for the temple. The square base measures across.\n\nThe construction of El Castillo, like other Mesoamerican pyramids, likely reflected the common practice of executing several phases of construction. The last construction probably took place between 900-1000 CE, while the substructure may have been constructed between 600-800 AD. Based on archaeological research, construction of El Castillo was based on the concept of \"axis mundi\". It is thought that the space remained sacred regardless of the structure positioned on the location. When a temple or pyramid structure was renewed, the former construction was ritually destroyed, which involved resolving the space of spiritual forces to preserve its sacredness. It is estimated that this construction dates to the eleventh century CE. After all of the work was completed, an entryway was cut into the balustrade of the northeastern exterior staircase to provide access to tourists. The older, inner pyramid is referred to as the \"substructure\".\n\nIn 1566, the pyramid was described by Friar Diego de Landa in the manuscript known as Yucatán at the Time of the Spanish Encounter (\"Relación de las cosas de Yucatán\"). Almost three centuries later, John Lloyd Stephens described with even more detail the architecture of the pyramid in his book \"Incidents of Travel in Yucatán\" (\"Incidentes del viaje Yucatán\"), published in 1843. At that time, the archaeological site of Chichén Itzá was located on an estate, also called Chichén Itzá, owned by Juan Sosa. Frederick Catherwood illustrated the book with lithographs depicting the pyramid covered in abundant vegetation on all sides. There are some photographs taken in the beginning of the 20th century that also show the pyramid partially covered by said vegetation.\n\nIn 1924, the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. requested permission from the Mexican government to carry out explorations and restoration efforts in and around the area of Chichen Itza. In 1927, with the assistance of Mexican archaeologists, they started the task. In April 1931, looking to confirm the hypothesis that the structure of the pyramid of Kukulkan was built on top of a much older pyramid, the work of excavation and exploration began in spite of generalized beliefs contrary to that hypothesis. On June 7, 1932, a box with coral, obsidian, and turquoise encrusted objects was found alongside human remains, which are exhibited in the National Anthropology Museum in Mexico City.\n\n\"El Castillo\" is located above a cavity filled with water, labeled a sinkhole or cenote. Recent archaeological investigations suggest that an earlier construction phase is located closer to the south-east cenote, rather than being centered. This specific proximity to the cenote suggests that the Maya may have been aware of the cenote’s existence and purposefully constructed there to facilitate their religious beliefs. \nAfter extensive work, in April 1935, a Chac Mool statue, with its nails, teeth, and eyes inlaid with mother of pearl was found inside the pyramid. The room where the discovery was made was nicknamed the \"Hall of offerings\" or \"North Chamber\". After more than a year of excavation, in August 1936, a second room was found, only meters away from the first. Inside this room, dubbed the \"Chamber of Sacrifices\", archaeologists found two parallel rows of human bone set into the back wall, as well as a red jaguar statue. Both deposits of human remains were found oriented north-northeast. Researchers concluded that there must be an inner pyramid approximately wide, shaped similarly to the outer pyramid, with nine steps and a height of up to the base of the temple where the Chac Mool and the jaguar were found.\n\nThe discovery of what appears to be a throne (referred to as the \"Red Jaguar\") in the throne room was previously assumed to have been decorated with flint and green stone discs, but recent research has determined the jaguar to be composed of highly symbolic and valued materials for ritualistic significance. The use of x-ray fluorescence (pXRF) was used to determine that the sculpture is painted red with a pigment that includes cinnabar, or mercury sulfide (HgS). Cinnabar was not in accessible proximity to Chichén Itzá, so the transportation of this pigment through long-distance trade placed a high value of this product. Additionally, the color red appears to be significant to Maya symbolism, and it is associated with creating life as well as death and sacrifice. Studies suggest that objects in Maya culture were imbued with vital essence, so the choice of painting the jaguar red may be a reflection of these beliefs, deeming the jaguar as an offering. The high-status associated with the cinnabar pigment and its red tone suggest that the jaguar was linked to ritual importance of closing a temple for renewal. \n\nThe four fangs of the Red Jaguar have been identified as gastropod mollusk shells (\"Lobatus costatus\") using a digital microscope and comparative analysis from malacology experts from the National Institute of Anthropology and History, another valued resource that may have been traded into Chichén Itzá. The green stones were also analyzed and determined to be a form of jadeite. Jadeite was valuable economically and socially, and the acquisition and application of the material is indicative of the access Chichén Itzá had along its trade routes.\n\nArchaeological studies indicate that the Red Jaguar is similar to other depictions of thrones found in murals (Temple of Chacmool), thus whomever was seated on this throne could have been accessing the point of \"axis mundi\", which is essential to the elements and relationship to the cosmological system. The symbolic usage of materials related to the underworld and death also suggest that it acted as an offering for ritually closing the temple.\n\nThe location of the pyramid is aligned at the intersection between four cenotes: the Sacred Cenote, Xtoloc, Kanjuyum, and Holtún. This alignment supports the position of El Castillo as an \"axis mundi\". The western and eastern sides of the temple are angled to the zenith sunset and nadir sunrise, which may correspond with other calendar events such as start of the traditional planting and harvesting seasons. However, the approximate correspondence with the Sun's positions on its zenith and nadir passages is likely coincidental, because very few Mesoamerican orientations match these events and even for such cases a different explanation is much more likely. Since the sunrise and sunset dates recorded by solar orientations, which prevail in Mesoamerican architecture, tend to be separated by multiples of 13 and 20 days (i.e. of basic periods of the calendrical system), and given their clustering in certain seasons of the year, it has been argued that the orientations allowed the use of observational calendars intended to facilitate a proper scheduling of agricultural and related ritual activities. In agreement with this pattern, detected both in the Maya Lowlands and elsewhere in Mesoamerica, the north (and main) face of El Castillo at Chichén Itzá has an azimuth of 111.72°, corresponding to sunsets on May 20 and July 24, separated by 65 and 300 days (multiples of 13 and 20). Significantly, the same dates are recorded by El Castillo at Tulum.\n\nIn recent years, the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), which manages the archaeological site of Chichen Itza, has been closing monuments to the public. While visitors can walk around them, they can no longer climb them or go inside their chambers. Climbing El Castillo was stopped in 2006, after a woman fell to her death. At the same time INAH closed public access to the interior throne room.\n\nToday \"El Castillo\" is one of the most recognized and widely visited pre-Columbian structures in present-day Mexico.\n\nAdditionally, researchers have discovered an enormous cenote (also known as a sinkhole) beneath the 1,000-year-old temple of Kulkulkan. The forming sinkhole beneath the temple is around and up to deep. The water filling the cavern is thought to run from north to south.\n\nResearchers also found a layer of limestone about thick at the top of the cenote, on which the pyramid is sitting.\n\nRecent archaeological investigations have utilized Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to examine the construction sequence of El Castillo. To preserve the site from potential damage, electrodes were placed non-traditionally as flat-based detectors around the quadrangle of the pyramid bodies of the pyramid. After each pyramidal body was tested, the data revealed two previous construction phases within El Castillo with a possible temple at the top of the second substructure. Determining the dates of when these constructions happened will provide time periods of when Chichen Itza may have been significantly occupied.\n\n\n"}

Josiah Wedgwood, who was previously based in Burslem, opened his new works in 1769. It was named after the Italian district of Etruria, home of the Etruscan people who were renowned for their artistic products. The site covered and was next to the Trent and Mersey Canal. As well as Wedgwood's home, Etruria Hall, it included the Etruria Works which remained in use by the Wedgwood enterprise until 1950. The Wedgwood factory is now in Barlaston, a village about six miles to the south of the Etruria site.\n\nEtruria Hall was the site of the substantial invention of photography by Thomas Wedgwood in the 1790s.\n\nMuch of Etruria became derelict with the move of Wedgwood after the Second World War and the subsequent closure of the nearby Shelton Bar steelworks. Large-scale regeneration began in the 1980s with the Stoke-on-Trent Garden Festival. Since the Festival closed at the end of 1986, the site has been given over to the Festival Park commercial and retail development. Etruria was also formerly home to \"The Sentinel\", the local evening newspaper for the Stoke-on-Trent area. The press hall there was responsible for printing several newspaper titles, including \"The Sentinel\", and many northern editions of \"The Daily Mail\". \"The Sentinel\" had previously been based in Hanley, and upon the site's closure it moved back. The site was bought by Bet365 and demolished to make way for new offices.\n\nEtruria was served by a railway station which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 9 October 1848, but it was closed on 30 September 2005.\n\nEtruria is home to the Etruria Industrial Museum, a scheduled ancient monument, which includes a working steam engine called \"Princess\". The museum buildings were originally a bone and flint mill built in 1857 to grind materials for the pottery industry. Inside visitors can see displays on the history of the site and original machinery. On the first weekend of each month the museum's 1903 coal-fired boiler provides steam to operate \"Princess\" which then turns the grinding machinery.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Etruria Railway Station was used as a base for Buffalo Bill and his Wild West Show. His reason was, that as it was in the Midlands, it was central to the whole country (and possibly a cheaper rent or lease for the sidings) and it was thus easier to get around the whole country than travelling completely from the south to the north and vice versa. Many of the performers in his show were often seen around the locality of May Bank and Wolstanton in their Native Indian attire, as it was the only clothes that they owned. There is local folklore which states that an elephant used in the show, died and is buried in the vicinity of the railway station.\n\nEtruria Canals Festival takes place annually at Etruria Industrial Museum on the first weekend in June.\n"}

After his playing days, Matthews was a color commentator for Phillies broadcasts. He batted and threw right-handed. He is the father of former big league outfielder Gary Matthews Jr. The Matthews are one of seven father/son combinations in Cubs history; another son, Delvon, was a member of Milwaukee's Minor League Baseball (MiLB) system in –.\n\nMatthews was selected in the first round of the June 1968 draft by the San Francisco Giants. He began his professional career in 1969 playing for the Giants' Decatur Commodores (A) affiliate in Decatur, Illinois. In 1973, his first complete season, he won the National League Rookie of the Year award.\n\nMatthews batted .281 during his 16-season major league career with San Francisco (1972–76), Atlanta (1977–80), Philadelphia (1981–83), the Chicago Cubs (1984–87) and Seattle (1987). He appeared in 2,033 games and recorded 2,011 hits, 234 homers and 978 RBI while scoring 1,083 runs. Matthews was the National League Rookie of the Year in 1973 after batting .300 with 12 homers and 58 RBI for the Giants. He had his best overall season with the Braves in 1979, going to the All-Star Game during a season in which he batted .304 with 27 homers and 90 RBI.\n\nMatthews saw postseason action with the Phillies in 1981 and 1983. He homered 7 times in 19 playoff games and was voted the MVP of the 1983 NLCS after leading the Phillies past Los Angeles into the World Series. In the 5-game series, he went 6-for-14 with three homers and eight RBIs. He was also a key contributor to the Cubs' NL Eastern Division title in 1984, batting .291 with 101 runs scored. He had been acquired with outfielder Bob Dernier and pitcher Porfi Altamirano in a spring training deal with Philadelphia for pitcher Bill Campbell and catcher Mike Diaz. In the first game of the 1984 NL Championship Series against San Diego, he homered twice. He spent three seasons as a starter in left field for the Cubs. Matthews was limited by injuries in 1987 before being traded in mid-season to Seattle for minor league pitcher Dave Hartnett.\n\nIn his 16-season career, Matthews batted .281 with 234 home runs and 978 RBIs in 2033 games. He finished with 183 career stolen bases, 1083 runs scored and 319 doubles. He had 2011 hits in 7147 at bats. He also showed decent plate discipline, with a lifetime .364 OBP, and a career high of .410. In 19 postseason games, he batted .323 with 7 home runs and 15 RBI. He posted a .968 fielding percentage as an outfielder.\n\nIn his last MLB plate appearance, Matthews faced Texas Rangers pitcher Mitch Williams and singled, but was picked off in the next at-bat ending the ballgame.\n\nAfter retiring as a player following the 1987 season, Matthews worked in private industry and broadcasting before joining the Cubs' organization in 1995 as minor league hitting coordinator, a position he held for three years. He left the Cubs in 1998 to become Toronto's hitting coach; he was a member of the Blue Jays' coaching staff for two years, then joined their broadcast team for two seasons. Matthews returned to the field in 2002 as Milwaukee's hitting coach and served as a coach for the Cubs in 2003–06.\n\nMatthews began his broadcast career as a radio commentator for the Toronto Blue Jays (2000–01) and as a studio analyst on Headline Sports Television, a Canadian cable network based in Toronto. After concluding his coaching career following the 2006 season, Matthews served as a color analyst for the Philadelphia Phillies from 2007 to 2013. During his first year in Philadelphia's booth, Matthews provided analysis for the entire game alongside Harry Kalas and Chris Wheeler (Kalas provided play-by-play for innings 1-3 and 7-9 while doing the 4th on radio and taking the 5th and 6th off. Wheeler relieved Kalas during the middle three innings while doing color analysis with Matthews the rest of the game). For the remainder of his Phillies broadcast tenure, Matthews provided analysis for only the middle three innings. Following Phillies victories from 2008 to 2011, Matthews would also conduct a brief on-field interview with a player who made a key contribution in that day's game.\n\nOn January 8, 2014, Matthews and Wheeler were relieved of their commentary duties with the Philadelphia Phillies. Both were assigned other jobs within the organization. Jamie Moyer and Matt Stairs were hired to replace them.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1921100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921100", "title": "WYOU", "text": "WYOU\n\nWYOU, virtual channel 22 (VHF digital channel 13), is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Scranton, Pennsylvania, United States and also serving Wilkes-Barre. The station is owned by Mission Broadcasting; Nexstar Media Group, which owns Wilkes-Barre-licensed NBC affiliate WBRE-TV (channel 28), operates WYOU under a shared services agreement (SSA). The two stations share studios on South Franklin Street in downtown Wilkes-Barre, with a news bureau and sales office at WYOU's former studios on Lackawanna Avenue in downtown Scranton. WYOU's transmitter is located at the Penobscot Knob antenna farm near Mountain Top. NextEra Energy Resources operates a digital replacement translator on UHF channel 25 that is licensed to Waymart with a transmitter in Forest City. It exists because wind turbines run by NextEra at the Waymart Wind Farm interfere with the transmission of full-power television signals.\n\nThe station was launched on June 7, 1953 as WGBI-TV. It was owned by the Megargee family and its company, Scranton Broadcasters, along with WGBI radio (910 AM, now WAAF; and 101.3 FM, now WGGY). Studios were located in the basement of Scranton Prep High School on Wyoming Avenue in Downtown Scranton. The station remained at this location for many years even after Scranton Preparatory School moved there. Managed for many years by founder Frank Megargee's daughter Madge Megargee Holcomb, Scranton Broadcasters was at one time probably the only broadcasting company in the country run by five women. This included Mrs. Holcomb, her mother Mrs. Megargee, and Frank Megargee's younger daughters: Katharine Megargee Collins, Mary Megargee Griffin, and Jean Megargee Reap.\n\nDespite its link with one of Northeast Pennsylvania's most prestigious broadcasters (the AM station had been founded in 1925), WGBI-TV operated on a tight budget. For example, the Megargees found AT&T's rates for a dedicated network feed line too high for their liking. This forced station engineers to switch to and from the signal of WCBS-TV in New York City whenever CBS programming was on-the-air. As a result, picture quality for network programming left much to be desired. The switchover was a delicate process requiring tight coordination between engineers stationed around the clock at the transmitter site and directors at the studios since no one there could see the WCBS feed.\n\nWGBI went into a limited partnership with the now-defunct \"Philadelphia Bulletin\" in 1958 and was renamed WDAU-TV after WCAU-TV in Philadelphia, which was also owned by the newspaper. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled that there was so much signal overlap between the two stations that they were effectively a duopoly. Its Grade B signal reaches the Lehigh Valley, which is part of the Philadelphia market. The \"Bulletin\" opted to retain WDAU-TV, and sold WCAU-TV to CBS. Even with new ownership, WDAU continued to rebroadcast WCBS' signal for network programming until the 1970s, when complaints about the poor quality of color network programming led it to buy a network feed. The limited partnership was short-lived, as the \"Bulletin\" sold its share of WDAU back to the Megargee family in 1959. However, Channel 22 retained the WDAU call sign for three decades even after the Megargees regained full ownership of the station.\n\nScranton Broadcasters then sold the station to Keystone Broadcasters in 1984. As a result, WDAU severed all remaining ties to the WGBI radio stations (which were retained by the Megargee family until the early 1990s; the stations have since changed their call signs and were eventually acquired by their current owner Entercom). Keystone, in turn, sold the station to Diversified Communications of Portland, Maine in 1986, with the call letters changed to the current WYOU on October 9. Soon afterward, the station moved to facilities on Lackawanna Avenue.\n\nAfter carrying \"\", the station added UPN as a secondary affiliation in June 1995. UPN programming ran primarily on weekends.\n\nWYOU was purchased by Nexstar Broadcasting as its first station property in 1996. In 1998, Nexstar bought rival WBRE and sold WYOU to Mission Broadcasting, but kept control of WYOU's operations under a joint sales agreement with WBRE as the senior partner. Gradually, most operations were consolidated at WBRE's studios. After vacating the larger Lackawanna Avenue facility, Nexstar opened a smaller news bureau and sales office next door.\n\nWYOU still has a film archive dating back to the 1950s. A 1972 flood ruined the film archive in WBRE's basement.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Nexstar announced it would acquire the assets of Chicago-based Tribune Media—which has operated WNEP-TV through a shared services agreement with Dreamcatcher Broadcasting since December 2014—for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. Nexstar was precluded from acquiring WNEP directly or indirectly, as FCC regulations prohibit common ownership of more than two stations in the same media market, or two or more of the four highest-rated stations in the market. (Furthermore, any attempt by Nexstar to assume the operations of WNEP through local marketing or shared services agreements would have been subject to regulatory hurdles that could have delayed completion of the FCC and Justice Department's review and approval process for the acquisition.) As such, on January 31, 2019, Nexstar announced that it would retain WBRE and the SSA for WYOU and sell WNEP to another buyer to address the ownership conflict; it was announced on March 20, 2019 that WNEP would be sold to Tegna Inc. Since Nexstar kept the WBRE/WYOU virtual duopoly, the transaction made them sister stations to MyNetworkTV affiliate WPHL-TV in Philadelphia and ABC affiliate WIVT in Binghamton; Nexstar was also required to sell Tribune-owned New York City CW affiliate WPIX to the E. W. Scripps Company due to ownership cap issues.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn June 15, 2016, Nexstar announced that it has entered into an affiliation agreement with Katz Broadcasting for the Escape, Laff, Grit, and Bounce TV networks (the last one of which is owned by Bounce Media LLC, whose COO Jonathan Katz is president/CEO of Katz Broadcasting), bringing the four networks to 81 stations owned and/or operated by Nexstar, including WYOU and WBRE-TV.\n\nWYOU shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 22, on February 17, 2009, the original target date in which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 13. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 22.\n\nWYOU serves one of the largest geographic markets in the country. This area is very mountainous making UHF reception difficult. However, the station was in a unique situation since Scranton/Wilkes-Barre was already a \"UHF island\" before the government mandated digital transition. As a result, WYOU had traditionally operated several translators to repeat and improve its signal throughout the market. However, in March 2010, to reduce operating costs, all owned and operated translators were shut down after Nexstar determined that its new VHF digital signal for WYOU was adequate to reach the entire market without the legacy UHF translator locations. According to nepahdtv.com, this move was met with some dismay from viewers in areas where reception of direct VHF signals from the single Penobscot Knob transmitter still proved difficult if not impossible, even in digital, leaving many rural viewers without access to CBS programming over the air. Despite the apparent decrease in effective coverage, no effort from Nexstar has been made to recommission any of the deactivated translators, presumably due to the very high penetration rate of cable television in the region.\n\nA digital channel 25 translator in Waymart remains operating, as the facility is owned and operated by NextEra Energy Resources. Wind turbines run by the company in the area surrounding Waymart interfere with the reception of full-power television signals.\n\nJust across the Delaware River along the Pennsylvania–New York State border, WYOU is carried on Charter Spectrum in Port Jervis, New York, located in Orange County. It is not carried by Cablevision in nearby Matamoras, Pennsylvania, located in Pike County. Orange County, New York and Pike County, Pennsylvania are both in the New York City Designated Market Area (DMA).\n\nSyndicated programming on WYOU includes \"Entertainment Tonight\", \"Judge Judy\", \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\", and \"Funny You Should Ask\".\n\nWDAU-TV was a solid runner-up to WBRE, and later ABC affiliate WNEP-TV (channel 16), for much of the time from the 1950s to the 1980s. This was achieved through its coverage of major stories including the Knox Mine Disaster and U.S. Senate hearings on racketeering in the late 1950s. The Associated Press commended the station on its gavel-to-gavel coverage of the Senate hearings and news director Tom Powell was courted by CBS to be a network news anchor. During the 1950s and 1960s, mirroring the longstanding rivalry between Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, WDAU dominated Scranton while WBRE ruled Wilkes-Barre.\n\nIn the early 1980s, channel 22 strengthened its hand when it brought in Gary Essex, longtime anchorman at WNEP, and teamed him with popular anchorwoman Debbie Dunleavy. It also became the second station in the market to use a news helicopter as well as the first to air a newscast in drive time.\n\nWYOU remained a solid runner-up to WNEP through the early 1990s. However, after Nexstar began the joint sales agreement with WBRE in 1998, Nexstar began pouring more resources into WBRE. Channel 22's ratings plummeted and would never recover; it has spent most of the new millennium as one of CBS' weakest affiliates—a far cry from the days when it was one of the network's strongest affiliates. Some have referred to WYOU as the \"ugly step-sister,\" since Nexstar has long favored WBRE over WYOU and was reportedly unwilling to make a significant investment in channel 22's news department. Even luring away another former popular WNEP anchorman, Frank Andrews, did not help the cause. He left the station in March 2006 to make a successful bid for a seat in the state house where he served under his real name, Frank Andrews Shimkus.\n\nIn 2002, both stations dropped their separate weekday morning and noon newscasts in favor of \"Pennsylvania Morning\" and \"Pennsylvania Midday\" which were jointly-produced and simulcast on both stations. Both programs were discontinued at the start of 2008, with WYOU replacing \"Pennsylvania Morning\" with the 6 o'clock hour of the nationally syndicated morning show, \"The Daily Buzz\", and returning to airing its own noon newscast.\n\nIn an effort to become more competitive with dominant WNEP, WYOU and WBRE instituted a major shakeup in format in the fall of 2006. WYOU relaunched its weeknight newscasts with a talk/debate format, with WBRE maintaining a more traditional format, setting a more clear competition against WNEP. Each WYOU weeknight broadcast started off with weather (\"StormCenter Weather\", another innovation) and a shortened rundown of the day's top stories. The show then focused on an ongoing story, investigation, or topic and brought in analysts and experts to discuss it. Viewers were able to call into the station and participate in the discussions. WYOU generally did a traditional newscast whenever WBRE had programming that bumped its news back by a significant amount of time.\n\nOn June 16, 2008, there were several more major changes made on the two stations. Candice Kelly, who anchored on the station, moved to the weeknight newscasts on WBRE. She was joined by newcomer Drew Speier. WYOU and WBRE's midday shows switched anchors. Mark Hiller moved from WBRE’s 11 a.m. news to WYOU’s noon broadcast, while Eva Mastromatteo switched over to WBRE at 11. Hiller also debuted as anchor of WYOU’s new \"First at 4\" weekday broadcast, the first 4 p.m. newscast in the market. This was followed at 4:30 by \"The Insider\" which moved from its 7 o'clock slot. WYOU dropped its 5 p.m. show and aired two episodes of \"Judge Judy\". At 6 o'clock, Lyndall Stout (who anchored on WBRE) joined Eric Scheiner for the half-hour \"WYOU Inter@ctive\". The station also launched a new weeknight newscast, \"WYOU News at 7\", to compete against WNEP's 7 p.m. newscast. All of the preceding changes were an attempt to better compete against WNEP.\n\nWYOU and WBRE shared a Williamsport Bureau on West 4th Street, though only WBRE appeared on the sign and WBRE's logo was dominant on the bureau's vehicle. There was no weekend sports anchor on WYOU.\n\nNexstar announced on April 3, 2009 that WYOU would shut down its news department effective the following day. This resulted in the layoff of fourteen personnel. Syndicated programming aired in place of the newscasts for just under three years. The station saved nearly one million dollars a year from closing down its news department. As a measure of how far WYOU's once-proud news department had fallen, the last Nielsen ratings issued before the shutdown showed its weeknight 11 o'clock newscast only garnered a four percent share. Even with the ending of its separate news department, WYOU struggled to receive even a 3% share of the ratings for syndicated programming in place of former newscasts. The secondary set at WBRE's facilities used to produce the newscasts on WYOU was eventually modified to broadcast an afternoon lifestyle show on WBRE called \"PA Live\".\n\nOn April 2, 2012, WBRE began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition, with a new news set, HD camera and forecasting equipment. With the upgrade, WBRE began producing half-hour newscasts at noon and 7 p.m. on WYOU, and the station began to simulcast WBRE's weekday morning, and nightly 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts (the first such newscasts on WYOU since its in-house news department folded just under three years earlier); these newscasts are also broadcast in high definition. This is a similar operation to existing joint news operations formed by Nexstar/Mission stations the year prior, between WUTR and WFXV in Utica, New York, and WTVW and WEHT in Evansville, Indiana.\n\n\n"}

Fon was founded in Madrid, Spain, in 2006, by Martín Varsavsky where it headquarters most of its operations.\n\nFon started out by building its Wi-Fi network through devices called \"foneras\". Members, whom the company called \"Foneros\", agreed to share a part of their bandwidth as a Wi-Fi signal, so that they could connect to other members' hotspots.\n\nAs the company evolved, it shifted its focus to working with mobile operators and telecommunication providers, and expanded from deploying residential Wi-Fi to providing access and technology to carriers and services providers.\nFon claims to operate a network of over 20,000,000 WiFi hotspots.\n\nFon Wireless Ltd. is a for-profit company incorporated and registered in the United Kingdom. It was created in Madrid, Spain, by Martín Varsavsky where it headquarters most of its operations. Fon also has subsidiaries and branch offices in the United States, UK, Brazil, France, Germany and Japan. Its investors include Atomico Ventures, Google, Index Ventures, Sequoia Capital and Skype.\n\nThe original idea of Fon was to create a network for Wi-Fi access wherever customers went. To become a Fon member, users had to buy a special router called a “Fonera”. With this router, they agreed to share a part of their bandwidth as a second Wi-Fi signal, in exchange for the right to use other members' Fon hotspots. To achieve this, Fon operated a system of dual access wireless networks. In 2007, Fon’s development model shifted to encompass ISPs and it began to work on creating Wifi community networks with British Telecom (BT) and SFR. In November 2007, Fon deployed its first wifi rollout, and continued using this foundation with more telco partners in the years to come.\n\nSince its initial involvement with ISPs, Fon continued to expand its network through partnerships with local Internet service providers in countries such as Germany, Greece, Japan, and Brazil among others. At the same time the company has continued to expand its product portfolio as technology developed.\n\nIn 2016 the company evolved to include premium networks such as airports, hotels, convention centers, public spaces, etc. in addition to residential networks. Fon also has a technology portfolio called to allow service providers to deliver services to their own customers.\n\nOriginally Fon began with a software download for compatible routers, in particular, Linksys routers. This is custom firmware based on OpenWrt.\n\nFon started using the OpenWrt base as firmware base for Fon branded routers. The firmware has been customised specifically for use in the Fon Community, allowing consumers to share their broadband connection and to connect to other Fon Spots around the world.\n\nFon firmware creates two different Wi-Fi signals: one private and one public.\n\nThe new 2014 Fonera SIMPL, introduced in February 2014, includes Facebook integration. The owner of the Fonera SIMPL may register their own Facebook account with the device. Once this is done, any user that is a 'Facebook Friend' of the owner is granted access to that Fonera (only).\n\nThe 'Fonera Business' takes Facebook integration further by offering free WiFi to customers of a business who are asked to 'Like' the Facebook page for the business in order to gain free WiFi access.\n\nIn early 2018, the Online-Shop closed: \"\"manufacture and sale of Foneras has been discontinued\"\".\n\nFon claims to have the largest Wi-Fi network in the world, with over 20 million hotspots as at June 2016.\n\nBT Group (formerly known as British Telecom) and Fon formed a partnership on 4 October 2007. They jointly created the BT-Fon Community by flashing Fon's software on all BT Total Broadband WiFi routers in the UK. This allowed BT Total Broadband customers to participate in the Fon community without buying a Fonera router and in some cases without sharing their own WiFi.\n\nIn 2007 Fon and SFR launched Fon on WiFi routers throughout France. SFR subscribers can opt into Fon to share and receive WiFi services.\n\nIn 2008, ZON (now NOS) announced a partnership with Fon to create the largest WiFi network in Portugal. Fon technology is built into NOS WiFi routers so its subscribers become part of the Fon community automatically.\n\nSoftBank is Fon's first collaboration with a mobile line operator wanting to offload data traffic to WiFi. Since 2010, SoftBank bundles a Fonera with every iPhone they sell.\n\nOn 31 October 2011 Oi announced its partnership with Fon, granting global WiFi access to its broadband customers.\n\nDiscontinued; From November 2011 through 2018, Belgacom (now Proximus) was part the Fon network. Proximus added Fon's WiFi-sharing technology to its BBox2 modem earlier in 2011, making it possible to broadcast two WiFi signals from a broadband internet source. Fon Membership was automatically activated (opt-out).\n\nDiscontinued; From 28 February 2012 through 2018 Fon was added Poland to its network, deploying over 100,000 hotspots in the first few months.\n\nKPN, a large telecommunications company in the Netherlands, and Fon formed a partnership to publicly launch the Fon network on KPN modems.\n\nIn March 2013, a new partnership with Deutsche Telekom in Germany was announced. Since then, four other Telekom branches have joined the Fon network:\n\nIn Spring 2013, HT and Fon announced the addition of their new partnership in Croatia.\n\nIn February 2014, Cosmote (then OTE), became the second DT company to join the Fon network.\n\n2 July 2014 marked Fon’s expansion into Romania with another DT company, Telekom Romania.\n\nOn 5 April 2016 Hungary became the 17th country to join the Fon network, and the 5th DT subsidiary to become a partner.\n\nIn February 2014, MWEB joined the Fon network. MWEB customers that have a Fon enabled router can share their WiFi Bandwidth and also use those of other Fon users in the countries and locations that Fon have partners.\n\nOn 20 May 2014 Telstra announced its collaboration with Fon. On 30 June 2015 Telstra Air was launched, granting home broadband users access to the Fon network.\n\nOn 22 April 2015 Vodafone Spain entered into a partnership with Fon at the same time Vodafone Italy announced their collaboration.\n\nOn 22 April 2015 Vodafone Italy entered into a partnership with Fon at the same time Vodafone Spain announced their collaboration.\n\nFon has received support from multiple investors in addition to various industry awards and recognition.\n\n\n\n"}

He entered private practice in Greenville from 1936 to 1942. He served in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1945. He returned to private practice in Greenville from 1945 to 1957.\n\nHaynsworth was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on February 19, 1957, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit vacated by Judge Armistead Mason Dobie. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 4, 1957, and received commission the same day. He served as Chief Judge and a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1964 to 1981. He assumed senior status on April 6, 1981 until his death on November 22, 1989 in Greenville, South Carolina.\n\nOn August 21, 1969, President Richard Nixon nominated Haynsworth to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. He was proposed to succeed liberal justice Abe Fortas, who had resigned over conflict of interest charges.\n\nHaynsworth was opposed by a coalition of Democrats (possibly in retaliation for the Republicans' rejection of Fortas as Chief Justice), Rockefeller Republicans, and the NAACP. He was alleged to have made court decisions favoring segregation and of being reflexively anti-labor. Democratic United States Senator Philip Hart of Michigan said that Haynsworth's decisions on civil rights and labor/management were \"unacceptable,\" while Republican Senator Marlow Cook of Kentucky argued that Haynsworth was being \"subjected to a character assassination that is unjustified.\" Cook argued that Haynsworth was \"a man of honesty and a man of integrity.\"\n\nControversy erupted over his rulings affirming the decision by local authorities to close the Prince Edward County schools to avoid integration, upholding the constitutionality of school voucher programs used to fund segregated private schools and supporting the management of the Darlington Manufacturing Company in South Carolina over its closing of the factory allegedly over unionisation.\n\nHaynsworth was also accused of ruling in cases in which he had a financial interest, although this claim was never proved. Haynsworth was later termed a \"moderate\" who was \"close in outlook\" to John Paul Stevens, a 1975 nominee of President Gerald R. Ford, Jr. Haynsworth's nomination was defeated by a vote of 55 to 45 on November 21, 1969. 19 Democrats and 26 Republicans voted for Haynsworth while 38 Democrats and 17 Republicans voted against the nomination. Haynsworth was the first Supreme Court nominee to be defeated by the Senate since the rejection of Judge John J. Parker (also of the Fourth Circuit) in 1930. Nixon eventually nominated Harry Blackmun, who was confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThe Clement F. Haynsworth Jr. Federal Building in Greenville was renamed in his honor.\n\n\n"}

It links the process of decompressing frames from a video source to the rest of the Quartz technologies for image rendering and composition. Both QuickTime X and QuickTime 7 depend on Core Video.\n\nCore Video provides both a buffering model and a playback synchronization solution within its processing pipeline. A video source provides a decompressed data stream to be rendered as images within a visual context in Quartz 2D. Core Video can be thought of as the link between this video source and its display context. Rendered images can be further processed by Core Image before being composed into a final scene with Quartz Compositor. As part of the composition process, Core Video maintains a \"frame buffer\", keeping a pool of rendered, composed frames ready for playback. To ensure smooth playback, Core Video uses a high-priority thread to maintain its frame buffer. This \"display link\" runs independently from the application which invokes video playback, and it compensates for different display refresh rates and latency.\n\nBecause QuickTime 7 employed Core Video, it was the first version of QuickTime to implement the rendering capability of Quartz. Previous versions of QuickTime used QuickDraw for rendering. Although Core Video typically interacts with QuickTime, it can interact with any video source.\n\nCore Video benefits from graphics processor (GPU) rendering and composition provided by Quartz GL, Core Image, and Quartz Extreme, since final playback is composed on an OpenGL surface.\n\nAlthough Core Video was introduced with the release of Mac OS X v10.4, it is included in the installation of QuickTime 7 on Mac OS X; thus, Core Video is available for Mac OS X 10.3.9 with QuickTime 7 installed as well.\n\nIn Mac OS X 10.4, Core Video is implemented as part of the QuartzCore framework; in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, it resides in its own framework.\n"}

In his first game against the New York Mets, Rader earned his first career hit, a single against Canadian-born reliever Ron Taylor, as his Astros won the game 3-2. On August 19, Rader hit his first career home run against Dick Hughes of the St. Louis Cardinals. He played a majority of his games at first base, and finished the season with a .333 batting average with 4 HR and 26 RBI in 47 games.\n\nDuring the 1968 season, the Astros moved Rader over to play third base, and in 98 games, Rader hit .267 with 6 HR and 43 RBI in establishing himself as their everyday third baseman during the second half of the season.\n\nIn 1969, Rader played in 155 games with Houston, hitting .246 with 11 HR and 83 RBI. He had a breakout season in 1970, as Rader appeared in 156 games, hitting .252, and was second on the Astros with 25 HR and third on the club with 87 RBI. Rader earned his first career Gold Glove Award as being the best defensive third baseman in the National League.\n\nRader struggled offensively during the 1971 season, as he hit .244 with 12 HR and 56 RBI in 135 games, however, he earned his second consecutive Gold Glove Award at third base. In 1972, Rader's batting average continued to slip, as he hit .237, however, his power numbers came back, as he hit 22 HR and 90 RBI in 152 games to be among the Astros team leaders, winning his third straight Gold Glove Award.\n\nRader had another solid season in 1973, hitting .254 with 21 HR and 89 RBI in 154 games with Houston, and once again was awarded the Gold Glove Award for third base, for the fourth straight season. He continued his solid play throughout the 1974 season, hitting .257, his highest batting average since 1968, while hitting 17 HR and 78 RBI, earning his fifth consecutive Gold Glove Award.\n\nIn 1975, Rader's offensive numbers slipped, as he hit only .223 with 12 HR and 48 RBI in 129 games, and for the first time since 1969, he failed to win the Gold Glove Award, as Ken Reitz of the St. Louis Cardinals received the award.\n\nRader was traded to the San Diego Padres for Larry Hardy and Joe McIntosh on December 11, 1975.

During 1980, Rader led the club to a 76–65 record as the Islanders finished in second place in the North Division. In 1981, Hawaii had a 72–65 record, and once again finished in second place. The Islanders moved to the South Division in 1982, however, the club finished in third place with a 73–71 record.\n\nRader was hired to manage the Texas Rangers in November 1982, taking over from Darrell Johnson. In his first season with the Rangers, the club finished 77–85, which was a 13-game improvement from the previous season, as Texas finished in third place in the AL West.\n\nThe Rangers slipped back into last place in 1984, as the club struggled to a 69–92 record.

In his two games managing the White Sox, the club had a 1–1 record. The White Sox then named Jim Fregosi as their permanent manager.\n\nRader was hired to become the California Angels manager beginning in 1989, after the Angels finished the 1988 season with a 75–87 record, and fired manager Cookie Rojas late in the season. In his first season with the Angels, Rader led the team to a 16-game improvement, as California finished the season with a 91–71 record, good for third place in the AL West.

A right-handed pitcher, Pole was tall and weighed during his playing career.\n\nPole attended Northern Michigan University and signed with the Boston Red Sox as an amateur free agent. He quickly developed into a top pitching prospect. With Class AAA Pawtucket in 1973, his 2.03 earned run average and 158 strikeouts led the International League. That same year, he pitched a no-hitter against Peninsula.\n\nPole made his Major League debut on August 3, 1973, starting the second game of a doubleheader against the Baltimore Orioles. He surrendered six runs in 3⅔ innings pitched and received the loss, as the Orioles won 8–2. He remained with the team, and spent the next four seasons moving between the rotation and the bullpen for the Red Sox.\n\nPole's career was nearly ended by an injury during a game against the Orioles on June 30, 1975, when a line drive by Tony Muser struck him in the face. The ball had been hit so hard that it bounced into foul territory near third base, scoring two runs on the play. Pole sustained a broken jaw and damage to the retina of his right eye. The damaged eye never fully recovered, and he ultimately lost ninety percent of the vision in that eye.\nPole recovered from his injuries in time to pitch in the 1975 World Series, walking the only two batters he faced in a 6–2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds in Game 5. The Red Sox ultimately lost the series in seven games.\n\nAt the end of the 1976 season, Pole became one of the inaugural members of the Seattle Mariners franchise, as they selected him from the Red Sox with the seventh pick in the 1976 MLB expansion draft. Pole spent 1977 and 1978 with the Mariners, but his performance was not up to the standard he had set in Boston, possibly due to effects from the injury. His most memorable moment with Seattle came on August 5, 1977, when he surrendered Reggie Jackson's 300th career home run. On March 24, 1979, the Mariners released him.\n\nPole ended his time in the majors with 25 wins, 37 losses, one save, and a 5.05 ERA in 122 games pitched and 531 innings. After the end of his Major League career, he continued to play professionally in Mexico.\n\nPole began his coaching career in the Chicago Cubs' minor league system in 1983, and joined their Major League coaching staff in 1988, working as pitching coach for Don Zimmer. Pole remained in that capacity through 1991, during which time he oversaw the development of Greg Maddux.\n\nMaddux credits Pole as a major influence, and a significant contributor to his success. In a 2005 interview, he said, \"I remember when Dick Pole told me one day, 'Why don't you stop trying to strike guys out? Just try to get them out, and you'll probably strike out just as many guys, if not more. He was right. I've always tried with two strikes just to make a pitch and get the guy out. You get a lot of strikeouts just on accident.\"\n\nPole returned to his roots as pitching coach for the Pawtucket Red Sox in 1992, then spent 1993 to 1997 on the coaching staff of the San Francisco Giants, under Dusty Baker. Pole next worked as bullpen coach for Boston in 1998. After that, he was pitching coach for the Anaheim Angels in 1999, for the Cleveland Indians from 2000 to 2001, and for the Montreal Expos in 2002. He re-joined the Cubs' staff in 2003. He was most recently the pitching coach for the Cincinnati Reds, taking the job in early November 2006. On October 2, 2009, the Reds relieved him of his duties, and Pole reportedly left immediately after being informed.\n\nPole's nephew Hank Pole pitched professionally in the Expos' system in 2002.\n\n \n"}

The idea which it conveys also appears in earlier works such as Plato's \"Nomoi\" (\"Laws\") and the Chinese \"Shi Ji\". The phrase presents the counter-intuitive insight that the conditions of peace are often preserved by a readiness to make war when necessitated.\n\nWhatever the source, the adage has become a living vocabulary item itself, used in the production of different ideas in a number of languages.\n\nFor example, historian de Bourrienne made reference to the foreign policy of Napoleon Bonaparte:\nIn other words, a leader who is planning a war should put other nations off guard by cultivating peace. Conversely, another interpretation could be that preparing for peace may lead another party to wage war.\n\nThe idea of ensuring peace by deterring warlike powers through armaments took an ominous turn in the 20th century with the increased militarism of Nazi Germany and other Axis Powers, suggesting that perhaps merely being prepared for war is not enough and that it is necessary to wage war in order to deter war. In the United States, the National Arbitration and Peace Congress of 1907, presided over by Andrew Carnegie, had addressed this issue years earlier:\n\n\"If you want peace, make war\". The solution does not cover the case of the nation that does not desire peace. Imperial Germany went to war in 1914 and was castigated by Richard Grelling, a German-Jewish pacifist, in \"J'Accuse\" (1915). In 1918 Grelling wrote again, this time as an expatriate in Switzerland. Citing Woodrow Wilson's \"The world must be safe for democracy\" speech before Congress on April 2, 1917, Grelling says:\n\n\"If you want peace, prepare for peace.\" The great wars of the 19th and 20th centuries were opposed by the philosophy of pacifism, which in the 19th century was associated with early socialism, even though the socialism of the 20th century often lacked pacifistic tendencies, preaching violent revolution instead. The pacifism that opposed the world wars traced its lineage to Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin, an early French socialist and one of the founders of Saint-Simonianism. As early as April 2, 1841, he had said in a letter to General Saint-Cyr Nugues:\nwith reference to Algeria. By way of elucidation Enfantin goes on to say that war could have been avoided if a proper study of Algeria had been made.\n\nThe main clause of the adage was used as a motto by German arms maker Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken (DWM), and is the source of the term Parabellum as applied to firearms and ammunition (especially the 9mm Parabellum cartridge). The term is an opposed parallel to the American use of \"peacemaker\" to mean the Colt Single Action Army handgun.\n\nVarious military organizations use or used this phrase as a motto:\n\n\n\n"}

While \"Lucky Luke\" revisited factual events in Wild West history, \"Punaniska\" mostly had completely fictional stories, most of which were absurdly humorous. \n\nDespite depicting a unilingually English culture, the comic was unilingually Finnish. A great deal of its humour depended on Finnish puns that were difficult, if not impossible, to translate into foreign languages. Still, one album was published in Germany in 1993.\n\nThe comic began in the Finnish newspaper \"Helsingin Sanomat\" , replacing an earlier Finnish comic strip called \"Taneli\", a comic about a kindergarten-aged boy. It quickly rose in popularity and spawned fifteen comic book albums, which featured \"Punaniska\" comics drawn also by other Finnish artists (and some others, too, like Hunt Emerson from Birmingham, England), and articles about the American Wild West.\n\nIn 2003 it started again, now in a small Finnish golf magazine called \"Gaddie-magazine\".

He received an MFA in music composition from the California Institute of the Arts. In 2011, Cohen received the honorary degree Doctor of Humane Letters from the University at Albany.\n\nHe spent several years \"writing humor pieces, essays, and stories for leading newspapers and magazines,\" including \"The New Yorker\", \"Harper's\", and \"The Atlantic\"; his first paid, published piece was in 1976 for \"The Village Voice\". In 1981, his book of satiric letters, \"Modest Proposals\", was published by St. Martins Press. In 1989, his collection of humor pieces, \"Diary of a Flying Man\", was published by Knopf.

His book \"Be Good: How to Navigate the Ethics of Everything\" was released by Chronicle Books in August 2012.\n\nCohen was a writer on \"Late Night with David Letterman\" for 950 episodes over seven years, starting in 1984. He shared in three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Writing for his work on the show. Perhaps his biggest contribution was the invention of Letterman's famous feature, the \"Top Ten List.\"\n\nCohen wrote for \"TV Nation\", sharing in a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Informational Series in 1995. In 1996, he became the original head writer for \"The Rosie O'Donnell Show\".\n\nCohen wrote for \"Slate\" starting in 1996.

From 2001 to 2005, he also answered listeners' questions on ethics for the National Public Radio radio news program, \"All Things Considered\". The \"Times\" ended Cohen's stint as The Ethicist, making his final column Sunday, February 27, 2011. The column continued with the same format but a new byline until early 2015, when it abandoned the question and answer format for a discussion format among a number of persons.\n\nCohen donated $585 to MoveOn.org's voter registration effort in 2004, apparently in violation of \"Times\" policy, which had banned political donations in 2003. The Spokane, Wash., \"Spokesman-Review\" decided on June 20, 2007, to drop Cohen's column, which had been scheduled to begin running in the paper on the following Saturday, because of his donation.

In Cohen's view of ethics, individuals are all more or less the same with respect to ethics, but society is often to blame for the very existence of an ethical dilemma, which aligns him (by his own admission) with many of the beliefs of the Society for Ethical Culture; a fundamental premise of this ethical framework is that humans are morally obligated to promote changes in society so all people can lead more ethical lives.\n\n\nCohen was born in Charleston, South Carolina and raised in Reading, Pennsylvania, in what he has called a \"suburban reform Jewish household.\"\n\nHe was formerly married to the writer and activist Katha Pollitt, with whom he has a daughter, Sophie Pollitt-Cohen.\n\nSpecific references:\nGeneral references:\n\n"}

He started his writing activity very soon and became a regular contributor to several newspapers and magazines, such as \"\"O Diabo\"\" (The Devil), \"\"Sol Nascente\"\" (Rising Sun), \"\"Vértice\"\" or the \"Diário de Lisboa\" (Lisbon Daily).\n\nSacramento also published several essays about Eça de Queiroz, Moniz Barreto, Cesário Verde, Fernando Namora or Fernando Pessoa, that made him become a respected person among the Portuguese intellectuals.\n\nDue to his intellectual activities and Anti-fascist and democratic feelings, Sacramento soon developed connections to the Portuguese Communist Party, at the time, the only organized resistance movement against the dictatorship. Because of that he became a member of the Central Commission of the youth wing of the Movement of Democratic Unity (Portuguese: Movimento de Unidade Democrática - Juvenil or MUD), the only opposition movement \"allowed\" by the regime, that congregated almost all those who were against the dictature. There, he developed his political activities and became famous among the democratic resistance. He was one of the main organizers of the 1st and 2nd Republican Congresses in Aveiro, congresses that in a somewhat secret way, traced important guidelines to the anti-fascist struggle, and was honored in the 3rd, that was only carried out after his death.\n\nSacramento was arrested for 5 times by the political police, the PIDE, the first one in 1938, when he was a member of the students union in a highschool in Aveiro.\n\nNowadays, Mário Sacramento is one of the most well-known persons of Aveiro, and his name is present in several places like schools, streets and avenues.\n\n«Mário Sacramento, La vie et l'Oeuvre», These de Doctorat, Sorbonne, DEC. 2002» [doctors degree thesis, in Sorbonne] by Eunice de Almeida Malaquias Vouillot :\n\nMário Sacramento, a Neo-Realism Portuguese writer, his life and work, is a two-volumes biography, divided into four parts.

His struggle for social justice under the «Estado Novo» repressive regime led him five times to prison, between 1938 and 1962. He ended his medical studies in 1946 at Lisbon University where he had participated to the «MUD Juvenil» Central Commission. He organized the First Republican Congress in 1957. In 1961, he graduated in gastroenterology, in Paris. He took part in many political and literary demonstrations, and in two conferences on childhood.

The 2000 census found 2,060 people in the township.\n\nNamed for the town of Windham, Connecticut, it is the only Windham Township statewide.\n\nPrior to 1811, the land now comprising the Village and Township of Windham was owned by Caleb Strong, as part of his holdings through the Connecticut Western Reserve, On September 11, 1810, a group of sixteen men met in Becket, Massachusetts at the home of Thatcher Conant to discuss the purchase of land in Ohio for settlement. These men, who would be known as the Beckett Land Company, consisted of Conant, Elijah Alford, Nathan Birchard, Gideon Bush, Dillingham Clark, Elisha Clark, Isaac Clark, Benjamin Higley, Aaron P. Jagger, Enos Kingsley, Jeremiah Lyman, Bill Messenger, Ebenezer Messenger, Benjamin C. Perkins, John Seely, and Alpheus Streator.\n\nOn November 11, 1810, the Beckett Land Company purchased about from Caleb Strong. The land was divided into 100 lots, and allotted according to each family's investment in the company. Conant, his wife Elizabeth, Dillingham and Abigail Clark, and Alpheus and Anna Streator donated portions of their allotments near the center of the township for a village green, which was common practice for townships in the Connecticut Western Reserve. The group of sixteen families then departed from Massachusetts on May 2, 1811. Six weeks later, they arrived in the purchased survey township, which was located immediately south of Nelson Township in the Connecticut Western Reserve. This new township, known today as Windham Township, was survey town 4 in range 6 of the Western Reserve.\n\nThe first religious service in the new township was held on July 28, 1811 in the home of one of the settlers. This service was very likely Congregationalist, as several of the families belonged to the Congregational Church in Becket, Massachusetts. The Congregational Church eventually constructed a building on the Green, and today that church still remains on the Green as a member church of the United Church of Christ.\n\nThe Windham Historical Society notes that the township was originally named Strongsburg, however, some sources cite the original name as Strongsburgh. The namesake was original landowner Caleb Strong, who was by then the Governor of Massachusetts. There is some discrepancy in how this township came to be known as Windham. According to the Windham Historical Society, the name of the township \"was changed to Sharon, by an act of legislature in about 1820….\nA few years later the name was again changed to Windham, which it has remained to present.\" The Historical Society also cites political concerns as the reason the name was changed from Strongsburg to Sharon. However, on Windham Township's website, March 2, 1813 is cited as the date on which \"the Township was made a district by itself and the name was changed to 'Sharon'.\" The website goes on to state that in 1820, by an act of legislature, the name was changed again to Windham. Yet another source, \"The Ohio Gazetteer, and Travelers's Guide\", states that the name was changed from Sharon to Windham in January, 1829. Still another source places these dates as 1817 and 1820, respectively. Common to most sources are a few claims which reasonably can be ascertained to be fact:\n\n\nThe township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.\n\nLocated in the northeastern part of the county, it borders the following townships and municipalities:\nThe village of Windham, which became independent of the township in 1993, is almost completely surrounded by Windham Township. The village of Windham borders Braceville Township in Trumbull County at the village's easternmost boundary.\n\nFormed from Town 4, Range 6 of the Connecticut Western Reserve, Windham Township covers an area of 23 sq mi. The township is nearly bisected from east to west by Interstate 80, also known as the Ohio Turnpike. The Ravenna Training and Logistics Site covers most of the southern half of the township. Hiram Township once adjoined Windham Township at the latter's northwesternmost point. When the village of Garrettsville annexed this portion of Hiram Township, that ceased to be true.\n\n"}
{"id": "1921242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921242", "title": "Khalji dynasty", "text": "Khalji dynasty\n\nThe Khalji or Khilji dynasty was a Muslim dynasty which ruled large parts of the Indian subcontinent between 1290 and 1320. It was founded by Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji and became the second dynasty to rule the Delhi Sultanate of India. The dynasty is known for their faithlessness and ferocity, conquests into the Hindu south, and for successfully fending off the repeated Mongol invasions of India.\n\nThe Khaljis were of Turko-Afghan origin: a Turkic people that had settled in Afghanistan before moving to Delhi. The ancestors of Jalaluddin Khalji had lived in the Helmand and Lamghan regions for over 200 years.\n\nThere is some debate about the ethnic group that the Khaljis belonged to, when the dynasty ruled. The Khalaj people in western Iran speak the Khalaj language. The modern Pashto-speaking Ghilzai Afghans are also descendants of Khalaj people; their transformation into an ethnic Afghan group can be dated to earlier than the 16th century. After a number of ethnic transformations, the Afghan Khalaj became the Ghilzay tribe of Afghans. Between the 10th and 13th centuries, some sources refer to the Khalaj people as of Turkic, but some others do not. Ibn Khordadbeh (9th century) mentions the Khalaj people while describing the \"land of the Turks\". But the distance between the Amu Darya and the Talas is such as it would have been impossible for the tribes living beyond the Amu Darya to use the Talas pastures as winter quarters, leading to the conclusion that the text has been corrupted somehow or that some Khalaj still lived near the Khallukh at the time. Minorsky argues that the early history of the Khalaj tribe is obscure and adds that the identity of the name \"Khalaj\" is still to be proved. Mahmud al-Kashgari (11th century) does not include the Khalaj among the Oghuz Turkic tribes, but includes them among the Oghuz-Turkman (where Turkman meant \"Like the Turks\") tribes. Kashgari felt the Khalaj did not belong to the original stock of Turkish tribes but had associated with them and therefore, in language and dress, often appeared \"like Turks\". The 11th century \"Tarikh-i Sistan\" and the Firdausi's \"Shahnameh\" also distinguish and differentiate the Khalaj from the Turks. Minhaj-i-Siraj Juzjani (13th century) never identified Khalaj as Turks, but was careful not to refer to them as Afghans. They were always a category apart from Turks, Tajiks and Afghans. \nMuhammad ibn Najib Bakran's \"Jahan-nama\" explicitly describes them as Turkic, although he notes that that their complexion had become darker (compared to the Turks) and their language had undergone enough alterations to become a distinct dialect. The modern historian Irfan Habib has argued that the Khaljis were not related to the Turkic people and were instead ethnic Afghans. Habib pointed out that, in some 15th-century Devanagari Sati inscriptions, the later Khaljis of Malwa have been referred to as \"Khalchi\" and \"Khilchi\", and that the 17th century chronicle \"Padshahnama\", an area near Boost in Afghanistan (where the Khalaj once resided) as \"Khalich\". Habib theorizes that the earlier Persian chroniclers misread the name \"Khalchi\" as \"Khalji\", but this is unlikely, as this would mean that every Persian chronicler writing between the 13th and 17th centuries made the same mistake. Habib also argues that no 13th century source refers to the Turkish background of the Khaljis, but this assertion is wrong, as Muhammad ibn Najib Bakran's \"Jahan-nama\" explicitly describes the Khalaj people as Turkic.\n\nThe accounts describing the Khaljis' rise to power in India indicate that they were regarded as a race quite distinct from the Turks in late 13th century Delhi. Over the centuries, the Khaljis had intermarried with the local Afghans and adopted their manners, culture, customs, and practices. They were looked down as non-Turks by Turks. Therefore, the Turkish nobles wrongly looked upon them as Afghans. They were considered Afghans in the Delhi Court.\n\nKhaljis were vassals of the Mamluk dynasty of Delhi and served the Sultan of Delhi, Ghiyas ud din Balban. Balban's successors were murdered over 1289–1290, and the Mamluk dynasty succumbed to the factional conflicts within the Mamluk dynasty and the Muslim nobility. As the struggle between the factions razed, Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji led a coup and murdered the 17-year-old Mamluk successor Muiz ud din Qaiqabad - the last ruler of Mamluk dynasty.\n\nJalaluddin Firuz Khalji, who was around 70 years old at the time of his ascension, was known as a mild-mannered, humble and kind monarch to the general public.\n\nJalaluddin succeeded in overcoming the opposition of the Turkish nobles and ascended the throne of Delhi in January 1290. Jalal-ud-din was not universally accepted: During his six-year reign (1290–96), Balban's nephew revolted due to his assumption of power and the subsequent sidelining of nobility and commanders serving the Mamluk dynasty. Jalal-ud-din suppressed the revolt and executed some commanders, then led an unsuccessful expedition against Ranthambhor and repelled a Mongol force on the banks of the Sind River in central India with the help of his nephew Juna Khan.\n\nAlauddin Khalji was the nephew and son-in-law of Jalal-ud-din. He raided the Hindu Deccan peninsula and Deogiri - then the capital of the Hindu state of Maharashtra, looting their treasure. He returned to Delhi in 1296, murdered Jalal-ud-din and assumed power as Sultan.\n\nAlauddin Khalji continued expanding Delhi Sultanate into South India, with the help of generals such as Malik Kafur and Khusraw Khan, collecting large war booty (\"Anwatan\") from those they defeated. His commanders collected war spoils from Hindu kingdoms and paid khums (one fifth) on \"ghanima\" (booty collected during war) to Sultan's treasury, which helped strengthen the Khalji rule.\nAlauddin Khalji reigned for 20 years. He attacked and seized Hindu states of Ranthambhor (1301 AD), Chittorgarh (1303), Māndu (1305) and plundered the wealthy state of Devagiri, also withstood two Mongol raids. Alauddin is also known for his cruelty against attacked kingdoms after wars. Historians note him as a tyrant and that anyone Alauddin Khalji suspected of being a threat to this power was killed along with the women and children of that family. In 1298, between 15,000 and 30,000 people near Delhi, who had recently converted to Islam, were slaughtered in a single day, due to fears of an uprising. He also killed his own family members and nephews, in 1299–1300, after he suspected them of rebellion, by first gouging out their eyes and then beheading them.\n\nIn 1308, Alauddin's lieutenant, Malik Kafur captured Warangal, overthrew the Hoysala Empire south of the Krishna River and raided Madurai in Tamil Nadu. He then looted the treasury in capitals and from the temples of south India. Among these loots was the Warangal loot that included one of the largest known diamond in human history, the Koh-i-noor. Malik Kafur returned to Delhi in 1311, laden with loot and war booty from Deccan peninsula which he submitted to Alauddin Khalji. This made Malik Kafur, born in a Hindu family and who had converted to Islam before becoming Delhi Sultanate's army commander, a favorite of Alauddin Khalji.\n\nIn 1311, Alauddin ordered a massacre of between 15,000 and 30,000 Mongol settlers, who had recently converted to Islam, after suspecting them of plotting an uprising against him.\n\nAlauddin Khalji died in December 1315. Thereafter, the sultanate witnessed chaos, coup and succession of assassinations. Malik Kafur became the sultan but lacked support from the amirs and was killed within a few months.\n\nOver the next three years, another three sultans assumed power violently and/or were killed in coups. Following Malik Kafur's death, the amirs installed a six-year-old named Shihab-ud-din Omar as sultan and his teenage brother, Qutb ud din Mubarak Shah, as regent. Qutb killed his younger brother and appointed himself sultan. To win over the loyalty of the amirs and the Malik clan, Mubarak Shah offered Ghazi Malik the position of army commander in the Punjab. Others were given a choice between various offices and death. After ruling in his own name for less than four years, Mubarak Shah was murdered in 1320 by one of his generals, Khusraw Khan. Amirs persuaded Ghazi Malik – who was still army commander in the Punjab – to lead a coup. Ghazi Malik's forces marched on Delhi, captured Khusraw Khan and beheaded him. Upon becoming sultan, Ghazi Malik renamed himself Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq. He would become the first ruler of the Tughluq dynasty.\n\nAlauddin Khalji changed the tax policies to strengthen his treasury to help pay the keep of his growing army and fund his wars of expansion. He raised agriculture taxes from 20% to 50% – payable in grain and agricultural produce (or cash), eliminating payments and commissions on taxes collected by local chiefs, banned socialization among his officials as well as inter-marriage between noble families to help prevent any opposition forming against him; he cut salaries of officials, poets and scholars in his kingdom.\n\nAlauddin Khalji enforced four taxes on non-Muslims in the Sultanate - \"jizya\" (poll tax), \"kharaj\" (land tax), \"kari\" (house tax) and \"chari\" (pasture tax). He also decreed that his Delhi-based revenue officers assisted by local Muslim \"jagirdars\", \"khuts\", \"mukkadims\", \"chaudharis\" and \"zamindars\" seize by force half of all produce any farmer generates, as a tax on standing crop, so as to fill sultanate granaries. His officers enforced tax payment by beating up Hindu and Muslim middlemen responsible for rural tax collection. Furthermore, Alauddin Khalji demanded, state Kulke and Rothermund, from his \"wise men in the court\" to create \"rules and regulations in order to grind down the Hindus, so as to reduce them to abject poverty and deprive them of wealth and any form of surplus property that could foster a rebellion; the Hindu was to be so reduced as to be left unable to keep a horse to ride on, to carry arms, to wear fine clothes, or to enjoy any of the luxuries of life\". At the same time, he confiscated all landed property from his courtiers and officers. Revenue assignments to Muslim \"jagirdars\" were also cancelled and the revenue was collected by the central administration. Henceforth, state Kulke and Rothermund, \"everybody was busy with earning a living so that nobody could even think of rebellion.\"\n\nAlauddin Khalji taxation methods and increased taxes reduced agriculture output and the Sultanate witnessed massive inflation. In order to compensate for salaries that he had cut and fixed for Muslim officials and soldiers, Alauddin introduced price controls on all agriculture produce, goods, livestocks and slaves in kingdom, as well as controls on where, how and by whom these could be sold. Markets called \"shahana-i-mandi\" were created. Muslim merchants were granted exclusive permits and monopoly in these \"mandi\" to buy and resell at official prices. No one other than these merchants could buy from farmers or sell in cities. Alauddin deployed an extensive network of \"Munhiyans\" (spies, secret police) who would monitor the \"mandi\" and had the power to seize anyone trying to buy or sell anything at a price different than the official controlled prices. Those found violating these \"mandi\" rules were severely punished, such as by cutting out their flesh. Taxes collected in form of seized crops and grains were stored in sultanate's granaries. Over time, farmers quit farming for income and shifted to subsistence farming, the general food supply worsened in north India, shortages increased and Delhi Sultanate witnessed increasingly worse and extended periods of famines. The Sultan banned private storage of food by anyone. Rationing system was introduced by Alauddin as shortages multiplied; however, the nobility and his army were exempt from the per family quota-based food rationing system. The shortages, price controls and rationing system caused starvation deaths of numerous rural people, mostly Hindus. However, during these famines, Khalji's sultanate granaries and wholesale \"mandi\" system with price controls ensured sufficient food for his army, court officials and the urban population in Delhi. Price controls instituted by Khalji reduced prices, but also lowered wages to a point where ordinary people did not benefit from the low prices. The price control system collapsed shortly after the death of Alauddin Khalji, with prices of various agriculture products and wages doubling to quadrupling within a few years.\n\nThe tax system introduced during the Khalji dynasty had a long term influence on Indian taxation system and state administration,\n\nWithin Sultanate's capital city of Delhi, during Alauddin Khalji's reign, at least half of the population were slaves working as servants, concubines and guards for the Muslim nobles, amirs, court officials and commanders. Slavery in India during the Khalji dynasty, and later Islamic dynasties, included two groups of people - persons seized during military campaigns, and people who defaulted on their taxes. The institution of slavery and bondage labor became pervasive during the Khalji dynasty; male slaves were referred to as \"banda\", \"qaid\", \"ghulam\", or \"burdah\", while female slaves were called \"bandi\", \"kaniz\" or \"laundi\".\n\nAlauddin Khalji is credited with the early Indo-Mohammedan architecture, a style and construction campaign that flourished during Tughlaq dynasty. Among works completed during Khalji dynasty, are Alai Darwaza - the southern gateway of Qutb complex enclosure, the Idgah at Rapri, and the Jamat Khana (Khizri) Mosque in Delhi. The Alai Darwaza, completed in 1311, was included as part of Qutb Minar and its Monuments UNESCO World Heritage site in 1993.\n\nPerso-Arabic inscriptions on monuments have been traced to the Khalji dynasty era.\n\nHistorians have questioned the reliability of historical accounts about the Khalji dynasty. Genuine primary sources and historical records from 1260 to 1349 period have not been found. One exception is the short chapter on Delhi Sultanate from 1302-1303 AD by Wassaf in Persia, which is duplicated in \"Jami al-Tawarikh\", and which covers the Balban rule, start of Jalal-ud-din Chili's rule and circumstances of succession of Alauddin Khalji. A semi-fictional poetry (\"mathnawis\") by Yamin al-Din Abul Hasan, also known as Amir Khusrau Dahavi, is full of adulation for his employer, the reigning Sultan. Abu Hasan's adulation-filled narrative poetry has been used as source of Khalji dynasty history, but this is a disputed source. Three historical sources, composed 30 to 115 years after the end of Khalji dynasty, are considered more independent but also questioned given the gap in time. These are Isami's epic of 1349, Diya-yi Barani's work of 1357 and Sirhindi's account of 1434, which possibly relied on now lost text or memories of people in Khalji's court. Of these Barani's text is the most referred and cited in scholarly sources.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1921259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921259", "title": "Windcatcher", "text": "Windcatcher\n\nA windtower (wind catcher) ( \"bâdgir\": \"bâd\" \"wind\" + \"gir\" \"catcher\") is a traditional Iranian architectural element to create natural ventilation in buildings. Windcatchers come in various designs: unidirectional, bidirectional, and multidirectional. The devices were used in ancient Iranian architecture. Windcatchers remain present in Iran and can also be found in traditional Persian-influenced architecture throughout the West Asia, including in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.\n\nCentral Iran shows large diurnal temperature variation with an arid climate. Most buildings are constructed from thick ceramic with high insulation values. Towns centered on desert oases tend to be packed very closely together with high walls and ceilings, maximizing shade at ground level. The heat of direct sunlight is minimized with small windows that face away from the sun.\n\nThe windcatcher's effectiveness had led to its routine use as a refrigerating device in Persian architecture. Many traditional water reservoirs (\"ab anbars\") are built with windcatchers that are capable of storing water at near freezing temperatures during summer months. The evaporative cooling effect is strongest in the driest climates, such as on the Iranian plateau, leading to the ubiquitous use of windcatchers in drier areas such as Yazd, Kerman, Kashan, Sirjan, Nain, and Bam.\n\nA small windcatcher is called a \"shish-khan\" in traditional Persian architecture. Shish-khans can still be seen on top of ab anbars in Qazvin and other northern cities in Iran. These seem to function more as ventilators than as the temperature regulators seen in the central deserts of Iran.\n\nWindcatchers were used in traditional ancient Egyptian architecture. A painting depicting such a device has been found at the Pharaonic house of Neb-Ammun, Egypt, which dates from the 19th Dynasty, c. 1300 BC (British Museum). In Egypt the windcatchers are known as \"malqaf\" pl. \"malaaqef\".\n\nWindcatchers tend to have one, four, or eight openings. In the city of Yazd, all windcatchers are four- or eight-sided. The construction of a windcatcher depends on the direction of airflow at that specific location: if the wind tends to blow from only one side, it is built with only one downwind opening. This is the style most commonly seen in Meybod, 50 kilometers from Yazd: the windcatchers are short and have a single opening.\n\nThe windcatcher can function in three ways: directing airflow downward using direct wind entry, directing airflow upwards using a wind-assisted temperature gradient, or directing airflow upwards using a solar-assisted temperature gradient.\n\nOne of the most common uses of the windcatcher is to cool the inside of the dwelling; it is often used in combination with courtyards and domes as an overall ventilation and heat-management strategy. It is essentially a tall, capped tower with one face open at the top. This open side faces the prevailing wind, thus \"catching\" it, and brings it down the tower into the heart of the building to maintain air flow, thus cooling the building interior. It does not necessarily cool the air itself, but rather relies on the rate of airflow to provide a cooling effect. Windcatchers have been employed in this manner for thousands of years.\n\nWindcatchers are also used in combination with a qanat, or underground canal. In this method, the open side of the tower faces away from the direction of the prevailing wind (the tower's orientation can be adjusted by directional ports at the top). When only the leeward side is left open, air is drawn upwards using the Coandă effect.\n\nThe pressure differential on one side of the building causes air to be drawn down into the passage on the other side. The hot air is brought down into the qanat tunnel and is cooled by coming into contact with the cool earth and cold water running through the qanat. The cooled air is drawn up through the windcatcher, again by the Coandă effect. On the whole, the cool air flows through the building, decreasing the structure's overall temperature. The effect is magnified by the evaporative cooling of water vapor when the air passes through the qanat water canal, as the water that evaporates in the canal has a large enthalpy of vaporization and, besides, the dry air is humidified by the evaporated water from the canal before entering the building.\n\nIn a windless environment or waterless house, a windcatcher functions as a solar chimney. It creates a pressure gradient which allows hot air, which is less dense, to travel upwards and escape out the top. This is also compounded significantly by the diurnal cycle, trapping cool air below. The temperature in such an environment cannot drop below the nightly low temperature.\n\nWhen coupled with thick adobe that exhibits good resistance against heat transmission, the windcatcher is able to chill lower-level spaces in mosques and houses (e.g. shabestans) in the middle of the day to frigid temperatures.\n\nDirecting airflow upwards using wind-assisted or solar-produced temperature gradients has gained some ground in Western architecture, and there are several commercial products using the name \"windcatcher\".\n\nThe windcatcher approach has recently been utilized in Western architecture, such as in the visitor center at Zion National Park, Utah, where it functions without the addition of mechanical devices in order to regulate temperature.\n\nUsing aluminum for the windcatcher provides a more efficient capturing system, allowing for wind capture from multiple directions. The Kensington Oval cricket ground in Barbados and the Saint-Étienne Métropole's Zénith both use this method.\n\n\n"}

First, Investigations Subcommittee took the Truman Committee's investigation of war contracts and procurement of the Hughes XF-11 reconnaissance aircraft and the Hughes H-4 Hercules flying boat (\"Spruce Goose\"). Second, the subcommittee also assumed responsibility for the records of the Truman Committee.\n\nUnder the chairmanship of Homer S. Ferguson of Michigan (1948) and Clyde R. Hoey of North Carolina (1949-1952), the Investigations Subcommittee of the Committee on Expenditures in Executive Departments held hearings on such matters as export control violations, for which Soviet spy William Remington was called in to testify; the trial of Nazi war criminal Ilse Koch; and the Mississippi Democratic Party's sale of postal jobs, which Mississippians from rural areas attested to purchasing. A much larger scandal erupted with the \"5 percenters\", so-called because these men, including Presidential aide Harry H. Vaughan, were accused of charging a 5% commission for their influence in securing government contracts. A legislative reform as a result of the hearings was a restriction of one year after leaving government employment before an attorney could practice law again before the government.\n\nAs news of war crimes during the Korean War unfolded, the Subcommittee on Korean War Atrocities was headed by Charles E. Potter, and began an investigation of the abuse and murder of prisoners of war such as forced marches, maltreatments, and the shooting and murdering of prisoners shortly after capture.\n\nIn the 83rd United States Congress, the subcommittee (now known as the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations or PSI), under its new chairman, Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, greatly increased the number of investigations and number of witnesses called. His subcommittee held 169 hearings throughout 1953 and 1954. Of the 653 people called by the Committee during a 15-month period, 83 refused to answer questions about espionage and subversion on constitutional grounds and their names were made public. Nine additional witnesses invoked the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution in executive session and their names were not made public. Some of the 83 were working or had worked for the Army, the Navy, the Government Printing Office, the Department of the Treasury, the Office of War Information, the Office of Strategic Services, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Others were or had been employed at the Federal Telecommunications Laboratories in New Jersey, the secret radar laboratories of the Army Signal Corps in New Jersey, and General Electric defense plants in Massachusetts and New York. Nineteen of the 83, including well known communist party members James S. Allen, Herbert Aptheker, and Earl Browder, were summoned because their writings were being carried in United States Information Agency libraries around the world.\n\nThe hearings also investigated such matters as communist infiltration of the United Nations; Korean War atrocities; and the transfer to the Soviet Union of occupation currency plates. From December 1952 to July 1953, Robert Kennedy was an assistant counsel of PSI.\n\nIn April 1954, McCarthy's exchange of charges with Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens led to the appointment of a special subcommittee of the PSI to investigate the charges. Chaired by Karl E. Mundt of South Dakota, the proceedings became known as the Army–McCarthy hearings.\n\nFrom 1955 until 1972, John Little McClellan of Arkansas chaired the PSI. McClellan continued extensive hearings of the Army Signal Corps at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and added new inquiries relating to communist activities in the United States and to business activities and alleged improper activities by Eisenhower Administration appointees and political associates. In the 86th Congress (1957), members of the Subcommittee were joined by Members of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare on a special committee (the Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management) to investigate labor racketeering. Chaired by Senator McClellan and staffed by Robert F. Kennedy, the Subcommittee's chief counsel, and other staff members, this special committee directed much of its attention to criminal influence over the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, most famously calling Teamsters' leaders Dave Beck and Jimmy Hoffa to testify. The televised hearings of the special committee also introduced Senators Barry Goldwater and John F. Kennedy to the nation, as well as leading to passage of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.\nAfter the select committee expired in 1960, the PSI continued to investigate labor racketeering and other labor-related matters. From 1961 through 1968, it also investigated gambling and organized crime in which Joseph Valachi testified about the activities of the Sicilian Mafia, the Billie Sol Estes case, irregularities in missile procurement, procurement of the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark fighter plane, excessive risks in underwriting Federal Housing Administration mortgages, riots, and civil disorders, the Agency for International Development commodity import program, and procurement of railway bridges for South Vietnam under the counter-insurgency program. The Subcommittee's investigations also led to passage of major legislation against organized crime, most notably the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO act\"), which is a section of the Organized Crime Control Act passed in 1970.\n\nIn 1973, Senator Henry M. Jackson, a Democrat from Washington, replaced McClellan as the Subcommittee's chairman and Senator Charles H. Percy, an Illinois Republican, became the Ranking Minority Member. During Senator Jackson's chairmanship, the Subcommittee conducted landmark hearings into energy shortages and the operation of the petroleum industry.\n\nThe regular reversals of political fortunes in the Senate of the 1980s and 1990s saw Senator Sam Nunn trade chairmanship three times with Delaware Republican William V. Roth Jr.. Nunn served from 1979 to 1980 and again from 1987 to 1995, while Roth served from 1981 to 1986, and again from 1995 to 1996. Senator Roth led a wide range of investigations into commodity investment fraud, off-shore banking schemes, money laundering, and child pornography. Senator Nunn inquired into federal drug policy, the global spread of chemical and biological weapons, abuses in Federal Student Aid programs, computer security, aviation safety, and health care fraud.\n\nIn January 1997 Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine became the first woman to chair the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Her Chairmanship was also notable in that she held the Senate seat of former Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith, an opponent of Senator McCarthy. Senator John Glenn of Ohio became Ranking Member. Upon Senator Glenn's retirement from the Senate, Senator Carl Levin became Ranking Member in 1999. In June 2001, when the Democrats resumed control of the Senate, Senator Levin assumed the chairmanship of the Subcommittee until January 2003 when Senator Norm Coleman assumed the Chairmanship. When the Democrats took control of the Senate in January 2007, the chairmanship reverted to Senator Levin.\n\nIn December 2004, Coleman called for Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan to resign because of the \"UN's utter failure to detect or stop Saddam's abuses\" in the Oil-for-Food Programme and because of fraud allegations against Kojo Annan, his son, relating to the same program. In May 2005 the subcommittee held Oil-for-Food Program Hearings to investigate abuses of the Oil-for-Food program, including oil smuggling, illegal kickbacks and use of surcharges, and Saddam Hussein's use of oil vouchers for the purpose of buying influence abroad. These hearings covered certain corporations, including Bayoil Inc., and Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky. The hearings received significant media attention for the combative appearance of British politician George Galloway of the Respect Party, in which he forcefully rejected the allegations.\n\nOn April 13, 2011 the Committee released its report on \"\". The 635-page bipartisan report was issued under the chairmanship of Carl Levin and Tom Coburn and also thus referred as the Levin-Coburn Report. It represents an in-depth investigation as well as a permanent record of the financial crisis of 2007–08 and took over two years of research and investigations to compile. It found \"that the crisis was not a natural disaster, but the result of high risk, complex financial products; undisclosed conflicts of interest; and the failure of regulators, the credit rating agencies, and the\nmarket itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street.\"\n\n\n"}

In April 2019, it was announced that the company will be acquired by MTY Food Group for $190 million.\n\nThe chain of take and bake pizzerias traces its history back to 1981, when the Papa Aldo's Pizza chain was founded in Hillsboro, Oregon. Three years later, Murphy's Pizza chain began operating in Petaluma, California. Both chains were later acquired and consolidated by Terry Collins into Papa Murphy's. The chain was incorporated as Papa Murphy's International, Inc. In 2003, Papa Murphy's was voted \"Best Pizza Chain in America\" by \"Restaurants and Institutions\" Magazine. The company was merged with PMI Holdings, Inc. in 2004.\n\nPapa Murphy's won the platinum award for Consumers’ First Choice in pizza chains in 2006, and was also winner of \"Pizza Today\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 2001, 2006, 2008, and 2009 Chain of the Year. Papa Murphy's Pizza was voted #1 Rated Pizza Chain for the third consecutive year, according to more than 10,500 respondents, in Zagat's 2012 Fast-Food Survey. In 2013 QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) Magazine, recognized Papa Murphy's with a 2013 Franchisee Satisfaction Award and in 2014 as top Top Pizza Chain and was rated first for both quality and healthy food.\n\nIn 2010, the chain sold out to Lee Equity Partners of New York. Sales for the chain totaled $702 million in 2011, which grew to $800 million in 2012 from 1,350 outlets.

In May 2019, it was taken over by Canadian private food conglomerate MTY, and removed from the NASDAQ.\n\nOrders are available by walk-in, order online, or call-in. Some stores have a drive-thru window where customers can pick up call-in orders. Unlike regular pizza establishments, the pizza is made at the store but is not baked there. Instead, consumers bake the pizzas at their homes. According to \"Nation's Restaurant News\", take-and-bake pizzerias typically have lower costs because they require less restaurant space and equipment. As a result, they are often able to undercut the national pizza giants. Papa Murphy's also offers salads, chocolate chip cookie dough, cheesy bread, cinnamon wheels, smores dessert bars, and soft drinks in various sizes.\n\nPapa Murphy's ranked No. 5 on \"Forbes\" magazine's list of the top 20 restaurant franchises to buy in 2011.\n"}

On 12 June 1944 he shot down a Fw 190, and on 30 July one Bf 109 individually and one with his wing man (counted as 0.5 'share'). During this period, he also shot down four V-1 flying bombs.\n\nOn 18 August 1944 Horbaczewski led his squadron of 12 aircraft over France on a 'Rodeo' mission, despite being ill with flu. The squadron, using the element of surprise, attacked a group of 60 Fw 190s of \"Jagdgeschwaders\" 2 and 26 over an airfield near Beauvais. Horbaczewski quickly shot down three Focke-Wulfs, but went missing during the dogfight. In 1947, the wreck of his Mustang with his body was found crashed near Velennes (Oise).\n\nExact circumstances are unclear; he was probably shot down in combat by an aircraft of II./JG 26. The squadron was credited with shooting down 16 aircraft in this encounter, with their only loss being the squadron leader (according to German documents, eight Fw 190 of JG 26 and four of JG 2 were destroyed).\n\n Virtuti Militari IV class (posthumously)<br>\n\n"}

Apart from early musical activities at secondary school (at age 12 he formed a band with fellow pupils, in which he played piano), Murdoch first became publicly involved in music as a radio DJ for Subcity Radio at the University of Glasgow.\n\nWhilst at university at the end of the 1980s, he became ill with myalgic encephalomyelitis, or chronic fatigue syndrome, and was unable to work for seven years. Murdoch said that the isolation of these years is what led to his becoming a songwriter: \"That was a big desert at the time, a kind of vacuum in my life. From that, these songs started coming out, these melodies where I could express what I was feeling.\" By early 1995 Murdoch had largely recovered from his illness and began to look for fellow musicians to form a band, which became Belle & Sebastian. Murdoch's struggle with chronic fatigue syndrome is the subject of the song \"Nobody's Empire\" on Belle & Sebastian's album \"Girls in Peacetime Want to Dance\".\n\nThis was also when he began living above a church hall and working as its caretaker, a position he maintained until 2003. In 2004 Murdoch told \"The Guardian\", \"I'm not actually a Christian with a capital C. I'm still asking questions. But I had this time when I found myself singing all these old hymns in my kitchen and I couldn't work out why I was doing it. Then one Sunday morning I got up, looked at my watch, and thought, 'I wonder if I could make it to a church service?' It was so welcoming. It just felt like you were coming home. Twelve years later, I've never left\".\n\nMurdoch's interest in faith has been perceptible in his lyrics. Belle and Sebastian's first album included lines about \"reading the Gospel to yourself,\" and on the second Murdoch sang of \"the pain of being a hopeless unbeliever.\" Religious references became more confident and direct on later albums, including \"If You Find Yourself Caught in Love\" (which continues \"say a prayer to the man above\"; this line becomes a refrain) on the album \"Dear Catastrophe Waitress\" and the two-part \"Act of the Apostle\" on \"The Life Pursuit\". Of \"If You Find Yourself Caught in Love,\" Murdoch told Gross, \"At the time I was writing it I thought, well, should I be so overt? Because I've often couched any religious overtones within characters in the past, but this is a bit more out there. And then I just thought, come on, you've been doing this for years, why not? Why not just be a bit more straightforward?\"\n\nSexually ambiguous lyrics in Belle & Sebastian's music have prompted Murdoch to confirm his heterosexuality in the press, calling himself \"straight to the point of boring myself\".\n\nMurdoch ran the Glasgow Marathon in 1986, and finished with a time of three hours.\n\nMurdoch is a vegetarian. He married longtime girlfriend Marisa Privitera on 26 November 2007 in New York City. Privitera is on the cover of Belle and Sebastian's DVD \"Fans Only\" and LP \"The Life Pursuit\". Their eldest son, Denny, was born in May 2013. Second son Nico was born in November 2016.\n\nMurdoch was diagnosed with colour blindness at an early age and does not drink. \"I like a Scotch whisky but I'm allergic to alcohol, would you believe, which is a tragedy in itself,\" he has said. \"It's only in the last couple of years. I got eczema and one of the things I had to do to get rid of it was give up alcohol.\"\n\nIn 2009 Murdoch contributed the song \"Another Saturday\" to the AIDS benefit album \"Dark Was the Night\", produced by the Red Hot Organization. He was one of the most notable protesters attending a 5 December 2009 march in Glasgow supporting governmental intervention to combat climate change, prior to the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 in Copenhagen.\n\nIn 2010 Murdoch published his first memoir, \"The Celestial Café\". In 2012–2013 he wrote and directed the musical feature film \"God Help the Girl\", released internationally and online in 2014.\n\n"}
{"id": "1921309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921309", "title": "Paul Kantner", "text": "Paul Kantner\n\nPaul Lorin Kantner (March 17, 1941 – January 28, 2016) was an American rock musician. He is best known as the co-founder, rhythm guitarist, and occasional vocalist of Jefferson Airplane, a leading psychedelic rock band of the counterculture era. He continued these roles as a member of Jefferson Starship, Jefferson Airplane's successor band.\n\nJefferson Airplane formed in 1965 when Kantner met Marty Balin. Kantner eventually became the leader of the group and led it through its highly successful late-1960s period. In 1970, while still active with Jefferson Airplane, Kantner and several Bay Area musicians recorded a one-off side project, \"Blows Against the Empire\" under the name \"Paul Kantner/Jefferson Starship\".\n\nJefferson Airplane continued to record and perform until 1973. Kantner revived the Jefferson Starship name in 1974 and continued to record and perform with them through 1984. He later led a reformed Jefferson Starship from 1992 until his death in 2016. Kantner had the longest continuous membership with the band, with 19 years in the original run of Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship and 24 years in the revived Jefferson Starship. At times, he was the only founding Jefferson Airplane member to remain in Jefferson Starship. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Jefferson Airplane in 1996.\n\nKantner was born on March 17, 1941, in San Francisco, California, the son of Cora Lee (Fortier) and Paul Schell Kantner. Kantner had a half-brother and a half-sister by his father's first marriage, both much older than he. His father was of German descent, and his mother was of French and German ancestry. His mother died when he was eight years old, and Kantner remembered that he was not allowed to attend her funeral; his father sent him to the circus instead.\n\nAfter his mother's death, his father, who was a traveling salesman, sent young Kantner to Catholic military boarding school. At the age of eight or nine, in the school's library, he read his first science fiction book, finding an escape by immersing himself in science fiction and music from then on. As a teenager he went into total revolt against all forms of authority, and he decided to become a protest folk singer in the manner of his musical hero, Pete Seeger.\n\nAfter graduating from Saint Mary's College High School, he attended the University of Santa Clara and San Jose State College, completing three years of coursework before dropping out to enter the music scene. For a while, he shared a communal house in Venice, Los Angeles with several other folksingers who would subsequently transition to rock, including David Crosby and David Freiberg.\n\nDuring the summer of 1965, singer Marty Balin saw Kantner perform at the Drinking Gourd, a San Francisco folk club, and invited him to co-found a new band, Jefferson Airplane. When the group needed a lead guitarist, Kantner recommended Jorma Kaukonen, whom he knew from his San Jose days. As rhythm guitarist and one of the band's singers, Kantner was the only musician to appear on all albums recorded by Jefferson Airplane as well as Jefferson Starship. Kantner's songwriting often featured whimsical or political lyrics with science fiction or fantasy themes, usually set to music that had an almost martial rock sound.\n\nAlthough the band retained a relatively egalitarian songwriting structure, Kantner became Jefferson Airplane's dominant creative force from 1967's \"After Bathing at Baxter's\" onward, writing the chart hits \"The Ballad of You and Me and Pooneil\", \"Watch Her Ride\" and \"Crown of Creation\"; the controversial \"We Can Be Together\"; and, with Balin, \"Today\" (an earlier effort from \"Surrealistic Pillow\") and \"Volunteers\". He also co-wrote the song \"Wooden Ships\" with David Crosby and Stephen Stills, but was not credited initially due to pending litigation with Jefferson Airplane's first manager. According to Balin, \"He was a hard-headed guy to get along with and wouldn't do anybody else's music. We had to do what he could do, so that's what we all did eventually. We pretty much just did Paul's music. That's all he wanted to do. But it was unique. It was part of that era, part of that time. A lot of those songs still exist, still live on, still are good.\"\n\nWith Jefferson Airplane, Kantner was among the performers at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1966 and the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 and the Woodstock Festival in 1969. Recalling Woodstock 40 years later, Kantner stated: \"We were due to be on stage at 10pm on the Saturday night but we didn't actually get on until 7.30am the following day.\" Later in 1969, the group also played at Altamont, where Balin was knocked unconscious during their set by a Hells Angels member originally hired as security for the concert. Kantner appears in the documentary film about the Altamont concert, \"Gimme Shelter\", in a tense on-stage confrontation with a Hell's Angel regarding the altercation.\n\nDespite its commercial success, the Airplane was plagued by intra-group fighting, causing the band to begin splintering at the height of its success. This was exacerbated by manager Bill Graham, who prodded the group to do more touring and more recording. During the transitional period of the early 1970s, as the Airplane started to come apart, Kantner recorded \"Blows Against The Empire\", a concept album featuring an \"ad hoc\" group of musicians whom he dubbed Jefferson Starship. This earliest edition of Jefferson Starship included members of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (David Crosby and Graham Nash) and the Grateful Dead (Jerry Garcia, Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart) alongside some of the other members of Jefferson Airplane (Grace Slick, Joey Covington and Jack Casady).\n\nIn \"Blows Against the Empire\", Kantner and Slick sang about a group of people escaping Earth in a hijacked starship. The album was nominated in 1971 for the Hugo Award, the premiere prize awarded by science fiction fandom. Although it received a plurality of the vote in the Best Dramatic Presentation category, this was superseded by a majority that elected not to award the prize that year. A sequel (\"Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra\") including several \"Blows Against the Empire\" participants was released as a Kantner solo album in 1983.\n\nKantner had been in love with Grace Slick for some time, but she was involved in a relationship with the band's drummer, Spencer Dryden. After their two-year affair ended, he finally had a chance with Grace. In 1969, they began living together publicly as a couple. \"Rolling Stone\" called them \"the psychedelic John and Yoko.\" Slick became pregnant, and a song about their child's impending birth, \"A Child Is Coming,\" appeared on \"Blows Against the Empire\". Kantner and Slick's daughter China Wing Kantner was born in 1971.\n\nKantner and Slick released two follow-up albums. \"Sunfighter\" was an environmentalism-tinged album released in 1971 to celebrate China's birth. China appears on the album cover, and the track list includes \"China\", a song written and sung by Slick about her new baby. Kantner and Slick made news again in 1972, when they were accused of assaulting a policeman after their Akron, Ohio concert. 1973's \"Baron von Tollbooth and the Chrome Nun\" was named after the nicknames David Crosby had given to the couple. Through longtime friend Jack Traylor, Kantner discovered teenaged guitarist Craig Chaquico in 1971. Chaquico contributed to \"Sunfighter\" and \"Baron von Tollbooth\" before going on to play with all of the incarnations of the Starship name until 1990.\n\nAfter Kaukonen and Casady left the Airplane in 1973 to devote their full attention to Hot Tuna, the core band on \"Baron von Tollbooth\" was formally reborn as Jefferson Starship in early 1974. Kantner, Slick and the three remaining late-Airplane holdovers (vocalist/bassist/keyboardist David Freiberg, drummer John Barbata, and fiddler Papa John Creach) were joined by Chaquico and Pete Sears, a contributor to previous solo efforts by Creach and Slick who alternated with Freiberg on bass and keyboards. Following a long sabbatical, Marty Balin began to work with Jefferson Starship while their first album, \"Dragon Fly\", was still in the works, co-writing the early power ballad \"Caroline\" with Kantner and performing the song on the album. Although \"Caroline\" failed to chart, the album peaked at #11, better than any Jefferson Airplane-related effort in three years. By 1975's bestselling \"Red Octopus\" (including the #3 hit \"Miracles\"), Balin was a full member and had ensconced himself as a major creative force in the group with the epochal song. Both \"Red Octopus\" and 1976's \"Spitfire\" (which featured another Balin-penned hit in the #12 \"With Your Love\") saw Kantner amalgamate his usual songwriting approach with the soft rock ethos favored by the group in such songs as \"I Want To See Another World,\" \"St. Charles\" (a minor hit that peaked at #64 in 1976) and the \"Song to the Sun\" suite.\n\nAlthough \"Earth\" (1978) – to which Kantner contributed just one song – duplicated the success of \"Red Octopus\" and \"Spitfire\" with two major Balin-sung soft rock hits (Jesse Barish's \"Count on Me\" [#8] and N. Q. Dewey's \"Runaway\" [#12]), Jefferson Starship saw major personnel changes before year's end. Slick had left Kantner in 1975 to marry Skip Johnson, a Jefferson Starship roadie. Despite the dissolution of their romantic relationship, she remained with the band through June 1978, when she left the group to seek rehabilitation for her alcohol use disorder after Kantner asked for her resignation following two disastrous concerts in Germany. Shortly thereafter, Balin quit the group in October 1978 to pursue a solo career. While no attempt was made to replace Slick, Balin was soon replaced by Mickey Thomas, who had previously achieved success as a member of the Elvin Bishop Group.\n\n\"Freedom at Point Zero\", a hard rock album dominated by Kantner compositions, was released in November 1979; it marked the band's last Top Ten album (peaking at #10) and included the #14 \"Jane\", a collaboration between Freiberg, musician Jim McPherson, Kantner and Chaquico. Kantner's new wave-inspired \"Girl with the Hungry Eyes\" also charted, peaking at #55.\n\nIn October 1980, Kantner was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in serious condition from a cerebral hemorrhage. Kantner had been working in Los Angeles on an album when he became ill. He was 39 years old at the time and beat considerable odds with a full recovery without surgery. A year later, Kantner talked about the experience, saying, \"If there was a Big Guy up there willing to talk to me, I was willing to listen. But nothing happened. It was all just like a small vacation.\" It was his second brush with serious illness or injury, having suffered a serious motorcycle accident in the early 1960s: \"I hit a tree at 40 miles an hour head first and nearly shattered my skull. I had a plate in there for a while.\" The injury from the motorcycle accident was credited with saving Kantner from serious complications from the cerebral hemorrhage; the hole left by the accident relieved the accompanying cranial pressure.\n\nGrace Slick returned for 1981's \"Modern Times\", which peaked at #26 and featured \"Stairway to Cleveland (We Do What We Want),\" a declamatory punk rock pastiche penned by Kantner and inspired by a phrase uttered by Nite City guitarist Paul Warren. It marked the beginning of a new era of diminished success for the group; although \"Modern Times\", \"Winds of Change\" (1982; #26) and \"Nuclear Furniture\" (1984; #28) all attained RIAA gold certifications and yielded several minor hits, they failed to eclipse the Balin-era group from a critical or commercial standpoint. Despite Kantner's efforts to retain a dialogue with the punk/new wave vanguard and a more idiosyncratic approach (exemplified by a lyrical collaboration with Ronnie Gilbert of The Weavers on the latter album), Jefferson Starship became increasingly beholden to the limitations of the album-oriented rock format. Additionally, the band continued to depend on external collaborators to an unusual extent for the era, most notably lyricist Jeannette Sears (the wife of Pete Sears) and songwriter/producer Peter Wolf.\nIn June 1984, Kantner left Jefferson Starship, complaining that the band had become too commercial and strayed too far from its countercultural roots. At the time, he was the only remaining original member of Jefferson Airplane in the group. Kantner made his decision to leave in the middle of the \"Nuclear Furniture\" tour. Upon his departure, Kantner took legal action against his former bandmates over the group's name after the rest of the band resolved to continue as Jefferson Starship; as Kantner's lawsuit proceeded, the group briefly performed as \"Starship Jefferson.\" Kantner settled in March 1985, and the group name was reduced to Starship. Under the terms of the settlement, no group could call itself Jefferson Starship without Paul Kantner as a member, and no group can call itself Jefferson Airplane unless Grace Slick is on board. Other accounts maintain that both parties agreed to only use \"Jefferson\" and/or \"Airplane\" if unanimous consent was granted by the five corporate directors of Jefferson Airplane (including Kantner, Slick, Kaukonen, Casady and manager Bill Thompson). The legal battle had personal repercussions as well, permanently damaging Kantner's friendships with Mickey Thomas and Craig Chaquiço. Although they eventually reconciled, Kantner's decades-long friendship with David Freiberg was also strained when the multi-instrumentalist refused to leave the band with him.\n\nIn 1985, Kantner formed the KBC Band with Balin and Jack Casady; they released their only album, \"KBC Band\", two years later on Arista Records. Although the album stalled at #75 in \"Billboard\", a video was made for \"America\" (a Kantner-Balin collaboration that peaked at #8 on the \"Billboard\" Album Rock Tracks chart) and the band embarked on a national tour. In 1986, Kantner headed for court with Slick and her husband Skip Johnson over the taping of some telephone conversations.\n\nWith Kantner reunited with Balin and Casady, the KBC Band opened the door to a full-blown Jefferson Airplane reunion. Following the demise of the KBC Band in 1987, Kantner briefly rejoined Hot Tuna after performing in the band's first lineup eighteen years earlier. In 1988, Grace Slick sat in with the band at a San Francisco concert. This led to a formal reunion of the classic 1966-1970 Jefferson Airplane lineup save for Spencer Dryden. A self-titled album was released by Columbia Records. While the accompanying tour was a success, the revival proved to be short-lived; as in 1973, the group never formally disbanded. According to Grace Slick, the reunion began as a joke: \"We hadn't even talked for a year, and we were battling legally – in fact, there are still some standing lawsuits between me and Paul, something to do with the Airplane. Anyway, the idea was that I'd just sneak in, stand at the side of the stage and come out and sing 'White Rabbit' and see what Paul did. Paul never got the joke, but he liked it, the audience liked it, and that's how it started.\"\n\nKantner and his Jefferson Airplane bandmates were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. The induction ceremony marked the first performance by most of the \"classic\" lineup of Marty Balin, Jorma Kaukonen, Jack Casady, Spencer Dryden and Kantner since 1970. Grace Slick had to miss the ceremonies because of a serious leg infection, but sent a message which Kantner delivered: \"Grace sends her love.\"\n\nIn early 1992, Kantner and Balin reformed Jefferson Starship. Although Balin was forced to scale back his involvement with the group due to family exigencies in the mid-2000s, Kantner continued to tour and record with the band through 2015. Kantner was joined in the later versions of Jefferson Starship with various former Airplane and Starship members, most notably Casady and Freiberg, who effectively replaced Balin once again in 2005. With their latest female vocalist Cathy Richardson and Kantner's son Alexander Kantner on bass, Jefferson Starship released their first studio album since \"Windows of Heaven\", titled \"Jefferson's Tree of Liberty\" in September 2008. The album was a return to Kantner's musical roots featuring covers of 1950s and 1960s protest songs from the American folk music revival.\n\nIn late 2010 Kantner started to compile collections of \"sonic art\" performed by him and various artists, including a mix of cover songs, sound effects, and spoken word, releasing multiple volumes under the title \"Paul Kantner Windowpane Collective\".\n\nOn March 25, 2015, it was reported that Kantner had suffered a heart attack. \"Paul's health took a bad turn this week,\" the members of Jefferson Starship said via a Facebook post. \"He's in the hospital, stable and undergoing tests to find out exactly what's going on, but doctors suspect he had a heart attack. He is in the best possible care and we are sending him all of our best wishes, good thoughts and healing vibes.\" The band also stated that they're \"continuing the tour without him, as most of the shows are sold out or close to it and we have to honor our contracts and our fans who bought tickets and put on the best show possible,\" the band said in its official statement. \"We will dedicate every show to Paul until he is well enough to rejoin us onstage.\" Kantner returned to the group later on in the year, in time to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jefferson Airplane with special shows that also featured Grateful Dead tribute group Jazz is Dead.\n\nKantner had three children: sons Gareth (a restaurateur) and Alexander (a musician who sometimes played with Jefferson Starship), and daughter China (a former MTV VJ and actress). After joining the late 1960s San Francisco rock scene's exodus to suburban Marin County by briefly relocating to Bolinas, California in the early 1970s, he decided to return to San Francisco as the Jefferson Starship era dawned, residing for many years in \"a beautiful house perched over the blue Pacific in the ritzy Sea Cliff neighborhood.\" Later in life, he moved to North Beach, where he frequented the original Caffe Trieste.\n\nA lifelong cigarette smoker (with a penchant for unfiltered Camels) throughout his adult life, prophetically opining in a late-in-life interview, \"I'm not going to give up the few things I enjoy. Might as well die of something I like.\"\n\nIdentifying as a political anarchist, Kantner advocated the use of entheogens such as LSD for mind expansion and spiritual growth, and was a prominent advocate of the legalization of marijuana, which he regularly consumed for most of his adult life. In a 1986 interview, Kantner shared his thoughts about cocaine and alcohol, saying, \"Cocaine, particularly, is a bummer. It's a noxious drug that turns people into jerks. And alcohol is probably the worst drug of all. As you get older and accomplish more things in life in general, you realize that drugs don't help, particularly if you abuse them.\" When Kantner suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in 1980, his attending physician at Cedars-Sinai, Stephen Levy, was quick to point out it was not a drug-related issue, saying: \"There is zero relationship between Paul's illness and drugs. He doesn't use drugs.\" \n\nBelying his reputation as a near-teetotaler during the commercial heyday of Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship, Kantner began to use alcohol more frequently in his later years, with bandmate Jude Gold ultimately characterizing Kantner's vodka intake as an \"on-again/off-again love affair.\" In a 2016 reminiscence, Marty Balin reflected on this period: \"It was sad to see. He didn't do anything to take care of his health with all his drinking and everything, smoking cigarettes all the time, pushing himself too much. He asked me to join him for this last go-round. He'd been touring around the world and I talked to him and said, 'You better be careful. Take care of yourself. You've got a grueling schedule.' He just said, 'Don't worry about me. I can do anything. I'm strong as a bull.' He WAS a hard-headed German.\"\n\nKantner died in San Francisco at the age of 74 on January 28, 2016, from multiple organ failure and septic shock after he suffered another heart attack days earlier. Shortly after Kantner's death, Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart reflected, \"He was kind of the backbone of that band. It was always about Grace and Jack and Jorma (Kaukonen), I don't think he got the credit he deserved.\" Coincidentally, he died on the same day as Airplane co-founder Signe Toly Anderson.\n\n\nIn 2004, a documentary containing 13 Jefferson Airplane performances and bandmember interviews was released on DVD.\n\n\n\n"}

Keenan (born May 8, 1967), is an American guitarist and vocalist, best known for his work with heavy metal bands Corrosion of Conformity and Down. He joined Corrosion of Conformity in 1989, but did not become the lead singer until the recording of \"Deliverance\" in 1994. In 1991 he formed Down with Phil Anselmo of Pantera, Jimmy Bower of Eyehategod, and Kirk Windstein and Todd Strange of Crowbar.\n\nKeenan was born in Oxford, Mississippi but now lives in New Orleans, where he owns a bar named \"Le Bon Temps Roule.\" His father, a former musician, is a local real estate appraiser in New Orleans. While developing his playing style in New Orleans, Pepper served as a member of local band Graveyard Rodeo, and met and became friends with Corrosion of Conformity during their frequent shows at the infamous Franklin Avenue VFW Hall in New Orleans. Keenan became the father of a daughter named Flannery Rose Keenan, with his longtime girlfriend Anna Hrnjak on January 5, 2010. In an interview with Guitar.com, Keenan was asked about his thoughts on politics in which he responded \"I mean, the Bible means a lot more to me than the Constitution and any fuckin' politics involved in this country or any other country.\"\n\nKeenan joined Corrosion of Conformity in 1989. Corrosion of Conformity released their third album called \"Blind\" with Keenan on rhythm guitar. After Karl Agell and Phil Swisher left the band (Swisher being replaced by original bassist Mike Dean), Keenan took over on vocals and guitar. Corrosion of Conformity have since released the albums \"Deliverance\", \"Wiseblood\", \"America's Volume Dealer\", and \"In the Arms of God\", as well as the live release, \"Live Volume\". From 2006 to 2010, Corrosion of Conformity had been on hiatus. The band has since reunited and recorded an album without Keenan. However, a possibility of Keenan re-joining C.O.C. remains, according to a message dated May 15, 2010, on the official C.O.C. website. According to drummer Reed Mullin, Corrosion of Conformity plans to reunite with Keenan in 2015 for a new album and tour. Corrosion of Conformity performed their first show with the re-united Deliverance era line-up of Pepper Keenan, Woody Weatherman, Mike Dean, and Reed Mullin on March 7, 2015 in Manchester, England. Their first U.S. tour with the re-united line-up, supporting Clutch, was announced on July 28, 2015.\n\nKeenan was a founding member of Down in 1991 along with Pantera's Phil Anselmo, Eyehategod's Jimmy Bower, and Crowbar's Kirk Windstein and Todd Strange. In 1995, Down released their debut album, \"NOLA\". The band went on indefinite hiatus in 1996 but returned three years later with Pantera bassist Rex Brown replacing Strange. In 2002, Down released their second album \"\". Following a second hiatus, Down released their third album entitled \"\" in 2007. Down released their fourth album \"Down IV Part I – The Purple EP\" in September 2012 and \"Down IV – Part II\" of a four-part series of EPs.\n\nKeenan plays guitar and sings a part of the second verse on Metallica's cover of the Lynyrd Skynyrd song \"Tuesday's Gone\". He also recorded a number of other songs in the same session, but this was the only one given a general release (on the album \"Garage Inc.\"), the others only being available as bootlegs. Keenan is good friends with lead singer and guitarist James Hetfield. Hetfield provided backing vocals on \"Man or Ash\" from Corrosion of Conformity's \"Wiseblood\". Keenan auditioned for Metallica's vacant bass player position following Jason Newsted's departure from the band but lost out to former Suicidal Tendencies/Ozzy Osbourne bassist Robert Trujillo. Keenan's audition is shown in the Metallica documentary \"\". In addition to his contribution to the song \"Tuesday's Gone\" Pepper also appeared with Metallica onstage at the Download Festival in Donington, England in 2006 along with Matt Heafy of Trivium to provide additional vocals on the song \"Die, Die My Darling\" (a Misfits cover). This song was played at the end of Metallica's headlining set.\n\n\n\n\n"}

No date of birth survives for the Grand Master. He was described by Matthew Paris as \"a discreet and circumspect man, who was also skilled and experienced in the affairs of war\".\n\nDe Sonnac was an established member of the order before his election as Grand Master. He was the Preceptor of Aquitaine in France for the Templars and arrived in the Holy Land around autumn of 1247, finding \"the remnants of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in a precarious state. Grand Master Armand de Périgord had been taken prisoner at the Battle of La Forbie in 1244, and after negotiations for his release failed two years later, De Sonnac was proposed as a replacement. Before his first year in the East was out, he was the order's new leader.\n\nDe Sonnac's tenure was a particularly violent one. By 1247, the Christians had lost power bases in Tiberias, Mount Tabor, Belvoir and Ascalon. This prompted a fresh campaign from King Louis IX of France, who landed at Limassol, Cyprus on 17 September 1248. De Sonnac sailed from Acre to meet him and make preparations. Shortly after, the new Grand Master received an Emir from the Sultan, offering the crusaders a peace deal. De Sonnac related this to the French King, who ordered him to cease any negotiations without gaining Royal permission first. This ensured the new campaign would be concluded with violence, not diplomacy.\n\nOn 5 June 1249, the French crusader army, combined with de Sonnac and his Templar knights, attempted to land in Egypt. They targeted Damietta, just as the Fifth Crusade had years earlier. Fighting on the Egyptian beaches was heavy and the King fought in waist-high water alongside the troops. After a prolonged battle, the Muslims were forced to retreat, leaving the city almost undefended. The next day the de Sonnac wrote to Robert of Sandford, telling how on the morning after the battle, Damietta had been seized with only one crusader casualty\n\nAt the end of November, de Sonnac and King Louis began their march to Cairo, via Mansurah.\n\nDe Sonnac's next engagement was at the Battle of Mansurah, for the city containing the area's defensive force, the last obstacle to central Egypt. The Muslims had been protected by the swollen Nile, but on 8 February 1250, a local Bedouin showed them where they could cross. De Sonnac, Robert of Artois, the King's brother and William II Longespee, leader of the English troops, launched an assault on the Muslim force without the main Frankish army. Taken by surprise, the Egyptians quickly retreated from the riverbank into the city and the Count foolishly gave chase, outnumbered and with no back-up from the bulk of the French forces.\n\nJean de Joinville claimed that the Count meant to follow on his own and that the rest of the raiding party did so as to not look cowardly. The Templars \"thought that they would be dishonored if they allowed the Count to go before them\". However, another source, Matthew Paris, reported that de Sonnac was forced into the assault by the Count. Robert was \"bellowing and swearing disgracefully as is the French custom\", and blaming the Templars and other religious orders for causing the real downfall of the Kingdom. Disgusted, de Sonnac returned to his men and prepared to chase down the numerically superior enemy.\n\nWhatever the fact, the three commanders charged into Mansurah with tired men and no reinforcements and were quickly drawn into heavy fighting. Completely surrounded, \"like an island in the sea\", de Sonnac refused to surrender and his Templars fought to the last man. Earl Longespee was killed in the fighting, and the Count either fell in combat or drowned fleeing to safety. De Sonnac's escape from the city would make him a famous warrior, when many had considered him more suited to diplomacy. With heavy wounds, only one eye and two remaining knights of the original 280, he fought through the Egyptian army and out of the city, where he found the main Frankish army. He refused to rest and after receiving medical attention he returned and helped repulse a Muslim raiding party.\n\nThe Christian forces camped outside the city and were under constant attack. A major assault was launched by the Muslims on 6 April and de Sonnac joined the Frankish charge to meet the enemy. He fought along the riverbank until he was finally overwhelmed by the attackers. Blinded fully by a second injury to the head, he was hacked down and killed by Muslim troops.\n\nHis death and the capture of Louis IX marked an end to the seventh crusade. He was succeeded as Grand Master by Renaud de Vichiers.\n\nDe Sonnac was the first Grand Master to formally record the intricacies of the Templar hierarchy. He added this to existing archives, codified them and stored them in a safe place so that the order would have accurate records in future years. It is certainly ironic that, for a man responsible for creating the order's most in-depth records, there is no indication of when he was born.\n\nGuillaume de Sonnac is a prominent character in \"Crusades\", a graphic novel by Izu, Alex Nikolavitch, and Zhang Xiaoyu, published by Les Humanoïdes Associés, in which he is show as a power hungry plotter.\n"}

He stayed in the provinces of Provence and Aragon, where he took part in the battles of the Reconquista on the Iberian Peninsula, and became Grand Master of the province until 1190. Then he became the Grand Preceptor of France, and in 1193, after the death of Robert de Sablé, he became Grand Master of the Order. In 1194, Pope Celestine III gave the Templars more privileges.\n\nHoral was known for wanting peace between the Christians and the Muslims, though some disagreed and thought that this showed treason and collusion with the enemy.\n\nDuring his leadership, the quarrel between the Templars and Hospitaliers increased. The arbitration of Pope Innocent III was in favour of the Hospitaliers because the Pope could not forgive the Templars for making the agreements that they had with Malek-Adel, brother of Saladin.\n\nAnother of Gilbert Horal's accomplishments was that he took the time to organize and consolidate the possessions of the Templars in France and Apulia. In Spain, the Templars took an active part in the Reconquista, and in 1196 were given the fortress of Alfambra by Alfonso II of Aragon as a reward for their efforts in the battles.\n\n\n"}

It was released as a single in January 1991 after being featured on the group's debut studio album \"Facelift\" (1990). It peaked at No. 18 on \"Billboard\"'s Mainstream Rock chart and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1992. The song was included on the compilation albums \"\" (1999), \"Music Bank\" (1999), \"Greatest Hits\" (2001), and \"The Essential Alice in Chains\" (2006). \"Man in the Box\" was the second most-played song of the decade on mainstream rock radio between 2010 and 2019.\n\nIn the liner notes of 1999's \"Music Bank\" box set collection, guitarist Jerry Cantrell said of the song; \"That whole beat and grind of that is when we started to find ourselves; it helped Alice become what it was.\" \n\nThe song makes use of a talk box to create the guitar effect. The idea of using a talk box came from producer Dave Jerden, who was driving to the studio one day when Bon Jovi's \"Livin' on a Prayer\" started playing on the radio.\n\nThe original \"Facelift\" track listing credited only vocalist Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell with writing the song. All post-\"Facelift\" compilations credited the entire band. It is unclear as to why the songwriter credits were changed.\n\n\"Man in the Box\" is widely recognized for its distinctive \"wordless opening melody, where Layne Staley's peculiar, tensed-throat vocals are matched in unison with an effects-laden guitar\" followed by \"portentous lines like: 'Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?', 'Jesus Christ, deny your maker' and 'He who tries, will be wasted' with Cantrell's drier, less-urgent voice.\" along with harmonies provided by both Staley and Cantrell in the lines 'Won't you come and save me'.\n\nIn a 1992 interview with Rolling Stone, Layne Staley explained the origins of the song's lyrics:\nI started writing about censorship. Around the same time, we went out for dinner with some Columbia Records people who were vegetarians. They told me how veal was made from calves raised in these small boxes, and that image stuck in my head. So I went home and wrote about government censorship and eating meat as seen through the eyes of a doomed calf.\n\nJerry Cantrell said of the song:\nBut what it's basically about is, is how government and media control the public's perception of events in the world or whatever, and they build you into a box by feeding it to you in your home, ya know. And it's just about breaking out of that box and looking outside of that box that has been built for you.\n\nIn a recorded interview with MuchMusic in 1991, Staley stated that the lyrics are loosely based on media censorship, and \"I was really really stoned when I wrote it, so it meant something different then\", he said laughing.\n\n\"Man in the Box\" was released as a single in 1991. \"Man in the Box\" is widely considered to be one of the band's signature songs, reaching number 18 on the \"Billboard\" Album Rock Tracks chart at the time of its release. According to Nielsen Music's year-end report for 2019, \"Man in the Box\" was the second most-played song of the decade on mainstream rock radio with 142,000 spins.\n\nThe song was number 19 on VH1's \"40 Greatest Metal Songs\", and its solo was rated the 77th greatest guitar solo by \"Guitar World\" in 2008. It was number 50 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of the 90s\" in 2007. The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1992.\n\nSteve Huey of AllMusic called the song \"an often overlooked but important building block in grunge's ascent to dominance\" and \"a meeting of metal theatrics and introspective hopelessness.\"\nThe MTV music video for the track was released in 1991 and was directed by Paul Rachman, who later directed the first version of the \"Sea of Sorrow\" music video for the band and the 2006 feature documentary \"American Hardcore\". The music video was nominated for Best Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Video at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards. The video is available on the home video releases \"Live Facelift\" and \"\". The video shows the band performing in what is supposedly a barn, where throughout the video, a mysterious man wearing a black hooded cloak is shown roaming around the barn. Then, after the unknown hooded figure is shown, he is shown again looking around inside a stable where many animals live where he suddenly discovers and shines his flashlight on a man (Layne Staley) that he finds sitting in the corner of the barnhouse. At the end of the video, the hooded man finally pulls his hood down off of his head, only to reveal that his eyelids were sewn together with stitches the whole time. This part of the video depicts on the line of the song, \"Feed my eyes, now you've sewn them shut\". The man with his eyes sewn shut was played by a friend of director Paul Rachman, Rezin, who worked in a bar parking lot in Los Angeles called Small's.\n\nThe music video was shot on 16mm film and transferred to tape using a FDL 60 telecine. At the time this was the only device that could sync sound to picture at film rates as low as 6FPS. This is how the surreal motion was obtained. The sepia look was done by Claudius Neal using a daVinci color corrector.\n\nLayne Staley tattooed on his back the Jesus character depicted in the video with his eyes sewn shut.\n\nAt Alice in Chains' last concert with Staley on July 3, 1996, they closed with \"Man in the Box\". Live performances of \"Man in the Box\" can be found on the \"Heaven Beside You\" and \"Get Born Again\" singles and the live album \"Live\". A performance of the song is also included on the home video release \"Live Facelift\" and is a staple of the band's live show due to the song's popularity.\n\n\nRichard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine covered \"Man in the Box\" in a lounge style on their 2005 album \"Aperitif for Destruction\". Platinum-selling recording artist David Cook covered the song during his 2009 Declaration Tour. Angie Aparo recorded a cover version for his album \"Weapons of Mass Construction\". Apologetix parodied the song as \"Man on the Cross\" on their 2013 album \"Hot Potato Soup\". Metal artist Chris Senter released a parody titled \"Cat in the Box\" in March 2015, featuring a music video by animator Joey Siler. Les Claypool's bluegrass project Duo de Twang covered the song on their debut album \"Four Foot Shack\".\n\n\n"}

It was similar in size, capacity, and cost with Apple's iPod Mini which debuted earlier the same year. This was Rio's second player to use a miniature hard disk for storage, after the Rio Nitrus, which was first to market with a 1.5 GB drive in late 2003.\n\nThe Carbon was announced on August 2, 2004.\n\nThe first 500 Carbons were produced as a Limited Edition with a unique serial number (1-500) that was laser engraved into the polished steel (back) side of the player.\n\nThe initial Carbon was silver with a 5 GB drive and retailed US $249.99, same as the iPod Mini with 4 GB. An off-white version called the Carbon Pearl was next, with a 5GB drive at first and then a 6 GB drive later as the price of Microdrives fell. This was followed by the 2.5 GB ce2100 (black) and ce2110 (light green) which offered reduced features and cost. An 8 GB model with a colour screen was planned, code-named Avalon, but was never produced due to the demise of Rio in August 2005.\n\nRio officially exited the portable music player market in August 2005 and is no longer providing firmware updates for the players. The last officially released version of the firmware (1.95) supports subscription-based and purchased PlaysForSure licenses.\n\nA previously unreleased version of Rio Carbon firmware, called \"The Developer's Cut\", was released in January 2006 by enthusiasts, and offers several new and updated features. \n\nThe Carbon features a microphone and a bidirectional wheel, which is used for scrolling and adjusting volume, along with a 5-way navigation pad. It is small in size (82 x 61 x 13 millimeters) and weigh 3.2 ounces, and is powered by a non-removable rechargeable lithium ion battery that has up to 20 hours of playback time.\n\nThe wheel is notched. Either the 5-way navigation pad or the scroll wheel and the menu button can be used independently to navigate through menus or they can be used together. The two have different behaviors, and are therefore complementary, not redundant. Since the wheel is used for navigation as well as volume control, one must leave the menu to adjust the volume.\n\nThe Carbon can play MP3 and WMA audio files as well as Audible.com audiobook files. It is Microsoft Windows, Linux and Macintosh compatible, since it is usable as a USB mass storage device. It is also PlaysForSure compatible.\n\nOther features include:\n\n\nIncluded with the purchase of the Rio Carbon and Rio Karma is Rio Music Manager, which can be used to transfer music to the Carbon. It only allows transfer of music files that are totally compatible with the player.\n\nThe Carbon, at the time of its release, had the unique distinction of costing less than one of its own components, its hard disk drive. This distinction led to an activity known by the slang term \"carbonising,\" whereby customers purchase a Rio Carbon, only to dismantle it and sell the disk drive for a net profit.\n\nThe Rio ce2100 is a relative of the Carbon that features a 2.5 GB hard drive. The ce2100 (sometimes mistakenly referred to as the ce2500), does not have a microphone, but retains the microphone hole since it shares the same case as the Carbon. The ce2100 comes in black. The green version has model number ce2110, the only difference being the color of the plastic piece on the front and its limited retail availability (Target and FYE stores only). The ce2100 is also compatible with the \"Developer's Cut\" firmware update.\n\n\nThe Rio Carbon, along with all of Rio's Microdrive-based players, can be modified to run on Compact Flash cards instead of hard disk. This requires a partial disassembly of the unit, removing the Microdrive, replacing it with a compatible CF card, and then formatting the memory and loading the device firmware. Compatible CF cards must be 8GB or less, and must have TrueATA/TrueIDE mode capability. This mod will increase speed and responsiveness of the player, along with making it more durable and increasing battery life. The 8GB limit is due to the 24-bit addressing in the firmware.<br>\nSome confirmed compatible cards:\n\n\n"}

Its principal is Victoria Dobbs.\n\nThe school serves several areas: Pinecrest, Palmetto Bay, and sections of the Kendall census-designated place.\n\nMiami Palmetto's athletic rivals are Miami Killian High School, Miami Southridge High School and Coral Reef High School. Coral Gables High School and South Dade High School were rivals throughout much of the school's history.\n\nMiami Palmetto was built in 1958. It serves a culturally and socioeconomically diverse population. Miami Palmetto is the home school for the residents of Pinecrest, Palmetto Bay, West Perrine, and Palmetto Estates.\nThe school enjoys strong support from the municipal governments of the two primary areas zoned to Palmetto Senior, the Village of Pinecrest and the Village of Palmetto Bay. Both provide noteworthy cash or in-kind donations and have active Educational Advisory Compact agreements that facilitate working with MDCPS. Pinecrest gives $10,000 to the school every year, and Palmetto Bay in 2015 sponsored a community-wide 5K Color Run fundraiser benefit. An active PTSA also contributes substantial resources (funding, programming, volunteer manpower).\nThe school is slated for a $29 million renovation, with groundbreaking anticipated in fall 2016. Palmetto for years was a three year high school, but after the 1997 addition it expanded to be a four-year high school.\nIn the school's history a few scandals have surfaced, one in which lacrosse players shared racist remarks through a group chat to later be counseled, and an incident where a student stabbed a classmate and her teacher with scissors. Miami Palmetto is currently participating in a pilot program of AP Capstone.\n\nThe diverse curriculum offers a choice of twenty-eight AP courses, and students have the highest pass rate for AP exams in the county.

In Shelley's story, Frankenstein created an intelligent, somewhat superhuman being, but he finds that his creation is horrifying to behold and abandons it. This ultimately leads to Victor's death at the conclusion of a vendetta between himself and his creation.\n\nIn much of his fiction, Dr. Asimov depicts the general attitude of the public towards robots as negative, with ordinary people fearing that robots will either replace them or dominate them, although dominance would not be allowed under the specifications of the Three Laws of Robotics, the first of which is:\nHowever, Asimov's fictitious earthly public is not fully persuaded by this, and remains largely suspicious and fearful of robots. \"I, Robot\"s short story \"Little Lost Robot\" is about this \"fear of robots\". \n\nIn Asimov's robot novels, the \"Frankenstein Complex\" is a major problem for roboticists and robot manufacturers.

He was an adopted son of Cao Cao, a warlord who rose to power in the late Eastern Han dynasty and laid the foundation for Wei. After Cao Cao's death and the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Zhen served under Cao Pi and Cao Rui, the first two emperors of Wei. He is best known for leading a successful defence of Wei from the first two of a series of invasions by Wei's rival state, Shu Han, between 228 and 229.\n\nThere are two accounts of Cao Zhen's origins. The first, from the \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\" (\"Sanguozhi\") and \"Wei Shu\" (魏書; by Wang Chen), claimed that Cao Zhen was a distant younger relative of Cao Cao, a warlord who rose to power in the late Eastern Han dynasty and controlled the Han central government. Cao Zhen's father, Cao Shao (曹邵), was a close aide to Cao Cao and was known for his intelligence and loyalty. Around 190, when Cao Cao was raising an army to join the Guandong Coalition, he sent Cao Shao to recruit soldiers from the various commanderies. Huang Wan (黃琬), the Inspector of Yu Province at the time, plotted to assassinate Cao Cao. Cao Shao sacrificed his life to save Cao Cao.\n\nThe second account, from the \"Weilue\", mentioned that Cao Zhen's original family name was Qin (秦), and that he was adopted into the Cao family. In this account, Cao Zhen's father was one Qin Bonan (秦伯南), who was a close friend of Cao Cao. Around 195, when Cao Cao was being attacked by soldiers under a rival warlord Yuan Shu, he took shelter in Qin Bonan's house. When the soldiers showed up and asked him where Cao Cao was, Qin Bonan claimed that he was Cao Cao and was killed by the soldiers. Out of gratitude to Qin Bonan for saving his life, Cao Cao adopted his children and allowed them to bear his family name.\n\nIn any case, Cao Cao took pity on Cao Zhen, adopted him and allowed him to live with one of his own sons, Cao Pi. One day, while Cao Zhen was out hunting, he encountered a ferocious tiger which started chasing him. Cao Zhen turned back and killed the tiger with a single arrow shot. Cao Cao was so impressed with Cao Zhen's bravery that he appointed his adopted son as an officer in the elite \"Tiger and Leopard Cavalry\" (虎豹騎) of his army. Cao Zhen scored his first victory in battle when he defeated bandits in Lingqiu County (靈丘縣; east of present-day Lingqiu County, Shanxi). In recognition of his achievement, the Han imperial court enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Lingshou Village (靈壽亭侯).\n\nBetween 217 and 219, Cao Zhen fought in Hanzhong Commandery against Cao Cao's rival Liu Bei, who had launched a campaign to seize control of Hanzhong Commandery from Cao Cao. When Liu Bei sent Wu Lan (吳蘭), one of his officers, to lead troops to garrison at Xiabian County (下辯縣; northwest of present-day Cheng County, Gansu), Cao Cao ordered his cousin Cao Hong to lead an army to attack the enemy. Along with Cao Xiu and Cao Hong, Cao Zhen fought at Xiabian County and defeated Wu Lan. He was promoted to Central Resolute General (中堅將軍) for his achievement.\n\nWhen Cao Zhen returned to Chang'an, Cao Cao appointed him as Commandant of the Central Army (中領軍). At the time, as his general Xiahou Yuan had been killed in action against Liu Bei's forces at the Battle of Mount Dingjun, Cao Cao was worried that Liu Bei would press on the attack at Yangping Pass (陽平關; in present-day Ningqiang County, Shaanxi). He commissioned Cao Zhen as Army Protector Who Attacks Shu (征蜀護軍) and ordered him and Xu Huang to lead troops to attack Gao Xiang, an officer under Liu Bei, at Yangping Pass. Cao Zhen and Xu Huang defeated Gao Xiang and drove him back. In 219, after a prolonged war against Liu Bei, Cao Cao eventually decided to give up defending Hanzhong Commandery so he withdrew all his forces. During the retreat, he sent Cao Zhen to Wudu Commandery (武都郡; around present-day Cheng County, Gansu) to meet up with Cao Hong and relay his order for them to retreat to Chencang (陳倉; east of present-day Baoji, Shaanxi).\n\nFollowing Cao Cao's death in March 220, his son Cao Pi succeeded him as the (vassal) King of Wei (魏王) and Imperial Chancellor (丞相) of the Eastern Han dynasty. Cao Pi appointed Cao Zhen as General Who Guards the West (鎮西將軍) and ordered him to supervise military operations in Yong and Liang provinces in western China. He also elevated Cao Zhen from the status of a village marquis to a district marquis under the title \"Marquis of Dong District\" (東鄉侯). During Cao Zhen's tenure, when one Zhang Jin (張進) started a rebellion in Jiuquan Commandery, Cao Zhen ordered his subordinate Fei Yao to lead troops to quell the rebellion. Fei Yao succeeded in his mission and killed Zhang Jin.\n\nIn late 220, Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian, ended the Eastern Han dynasty, and established the state of Cao Wei with himself as the new emperor. Two years later, Cao Pi summoned Cao Zhen to the Wei imperial capital, Luoyang, where he reassigned Cao Zhen to be Senior General of the Upper Army (上軍大將軍), awarded him a ceremonial axe, and put him in charge of supervising military affairs throughout Wei.\n\nIn 223, Cao Pi ordered Cao Zhen, Xiahou Shang, Zhang He and others to lead Wei forces to attack Wei's rival state, Eastern Wu, while he personally stationed at Wan (宛; in present-day Nanyang, Henan) to provide backup. The Wei forces attacked and besieged Jiangling (江陵; present-day Jiangling County, Hubei), which was defended by the Wu general Zhu Ran and some 5,000 soldiers. The Wei forces managed to defeat Wu reinforcements led by Sun Sheng (孫盛), Pan Zhang and Yang Can (楊粲), who were trying to help Zhu Ran. During the siege, Cao Zhen ordered his troops to dig tunnels, pile up earth to form small mounds, and build watchtowers to rain arrows on the defenders in Jiangling. Zhu Ran and his men managed to hold their ground and even found a small opportunity to counterattack and destroy two Wei camps. After some six months of siege, the Wei forces could not breach Jiangling's walls so they retreated.\n\nDuring the campaign, Cao Zhen and Xiahou Shang managed to destroy a Wu garrison at Niuzhu (牛渚; northwest of present-day Dangtu County, Anhui). After he returned from the campaign, Cao Zhen was reassigned to be Senior General of the Central Army (中軍大將軍) and given an additional appointment as an Official Who Concurrently Serves in the Palace (給事中).\n\nIn 224, Cao Pi ordered Wu Zhi to host a banquet in his residence to celebrate Cao Zhen's return from a campaign. In Cao Pi's imperial edict, all officers holding the rank of Senior General (上將軍) with \"Specially Advanced\" (特進) status and below had to attend. During the banquet, Wu Zhi instructed actors to put up a skit to make fun of Cao Zhen and Zhu Shuo (朱鑠), who were fat and thin respectively. Cao Zhen turned furious and he shouted at Wu Zhi, \"Are you and your men seeking a fight with me and my men?\" Cao Hong and Wang Zhong egged Wu Zhi on by saying, \"If you want to make the General (Cao Zhen) admit that he is fat, you have to show that you're thin.\" Cao Zhen drew his sword, glared at them and said, \"I'll kill whoever dares to mock me.\" Wu Zhi also drew his sword and insulted Cao Zhen by saying, \"Cao Zidan, you're not meat under a butcher's cleaver. My throat won't tremble when I swallow you and my teeth won't chatter when I chew on you. How dare you behave so rudely!\" Zhu Shuo stood up and tried to reduce tensions by telling Wu Zhi, \"His Majesty ordered you to host entertainment for everyone. Do you have to do this?\" Wu Zhi then shouted at Zhu Shuo, \"Zhu Shuo, how dare you leave your seat!\" Everyone then returned to their seats. Zhu Shuo felt outraged but did not say anything, and returned to his seat and used his sword to hit the ground.\n\nIn 226, when Cao Pi became critically ill, he ordered Cao Zhen, Chen Qun, Sima Yi and others to assist his son, Cao Rui, who later succeeded him as the second emperor of Wei. After his coronation, Cao Rui elevated Cao Zhen from the status of a district marquis to a county marquis under the title \"Marquis of Shaoling\" (邵陵侯), and promoted him to the position of General-in-Chief (大將軍) in January or February 227.\n\nIn the spring of 228, Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor (丞相) of Wei's rival state Shu Han, launched the first of a series of military campaigns against Wei and led the Shu forces to attack Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu). At the same time, he also ordered Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi to lead a detachment of troops to Ji Valley (箕谷) and pretend to be preparing to attack Mei County (郿縣; southeast of present-day Fufeng County, Shaanxi), so as to draw the Wei forces' attention away from Mount Qi. Three Wei-controlled commanderies – Nan'an (南安; around present-day Longxi County, Gansu), Tianshui and Anding (安定; around present-day Zhenyuan County, Gansu) – responded to the Shu invasion by defecting to the Shu side.\n\nWhen the Wei imperial court received news of the invasion, Cao Rui ordered Cao Zhen to lead Wei forces to resist the invaders. At Ji Valley, Cao Zhen easily defeated Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi, who had been given command of the weaker soldiers in the Shu army. (Zhuge Liang had reserved the better soldiers for his own army to attack Mount Qi.) In the meantime, the Wei general Zhang He attacked and defeated the Shu general Ma Su at the Battle of Jieting. Around the time, one Yang Tiao (楊條) from Anding Commandery had rallied some followers, taken the commandery officials hostage and captured the revenue office. When Cao Zhen and his troops besieged Anding Commandery, Yang Tiao tied himself up and surrendered. Zhuge Liang and the Shu forces retreated upon learning of Ma Su’s defeat. The Wei forces under Cao Zhen and Zhang He then used the opportunity to quell the rebellions in the three commanderies and restore peace.\n\nAfter repelling the first Shu invasion, Cao Zhen observed that if Shu were to invade Wei again, they would attack via Chencang (陳倉; east of present-day Baoji, Shaanxi). He then put Hao Zhao and Wang Sheng (王生) in charge of defending Chencang and ordered them to strengthen the fortress's defences. As Cao Zhen foresaw, Zhuge Liang indeed led Shu forces to attack Chencang in the spring of 229. However, as Hao Zhao and the Wei defenders were well-prepared, they managed to hold their ground against the second Shu invasion. Zhuge Liang ordered a retreat after failing to breach Chencang's walls. As a reward for Cao Zhen's contributions, Cao Rui increased the number of taxable households in his marquisate, bringing it up to a total of 2,900.\n\nIn 230, Cao Rui summoned Cao Zhen to the imperial capital Luoyang, where he promoted him to Grand Marshal (大司馬) and awarded him the ceremonial privileges of carrying a sword and wearing shoes into the imperial court, as well as not having to walk in briskly during imperial court sessions.\n\nDuring this meeting with Cao Rui, Cao Zhen proposed launching a large-scale invasion of Shu from multiple directions to eliminate the threat once and for all. Cao Rui approved his proposal and personally saw him off from Luoyang. In September 230, Cao Zhen led an army from Chang'an to attack Shu via the Ziwu Valley (子午谷). At the same time, another Wei army led by Sima Yi, acting on Cao Rui's order, advanced towards Shu from Jing Province by sailing along the Han River. The rendezvous point for Cao Zhen and Sima Yi's armies was at Nanzheng County (南鄭縣; in present-day Hanzhong, Shaanxi). Other Wei armies also prepared to attack Shu from the Xie Valley (斜谷) or Wuwei Commandery. However, the campaign eventually had to be aborted in October 230 because the gallery roads leading into Shu were too damaged for the troops to pass through, and also because of rainy weather lasting more than 30 days.\n\nCao Zhen fell sick on the journey back to Luoyang and became bedridden in the subsequent months. During this time, Cao Rui personally visited Cao Zhen to check on his condition. Cao Zhen eventually died of illness in April or May 231. Cao Rui honoured him with the posthumous title \"Marquis Yuan\" (元侯).\n\nCao Zhen was known for being generous with his personal wealth. In his younger days, he served under his foster father Cao Cao along with Cao Zun (曹遵), a distant relative of his, and Zhu Zan (朱讚), who was from the same hometown as him. Both Cao Zun and Zhu Zan died early. Cao Zhen took pity on their families so he requested permission from Cao Rui to give away parts of his marquisate to Cao Zun and Zhu Zan's sons. Cao Rui issued an imperial decree to praise Cao Zhen for his kindness, and award secondary marquis titles to Cao Zun and Zhu Zan's sons and give them each 100 taxable households.\n\nCao Zhen was also known for sharing weal and woe with his troops whenever he led them into battle. Every time after a battle, if there were insufficient rewards to be given out to all his men, he would use his personal wealth to make up for the difference. His men gladly accepted his kindness.\n\nCao Zhen had a younger brother, Cao Bin (曹彬), who received a marquis title and a marquisate of 200 taxable households by Cao Pi's decree. He also had a younger sister who married Xiahou Shang and bore Xiahou Xuan and Xiahou Hui; her personal name is unknown and she was referred to as the Lady of Deyang District (德陽鄉主).\n\nCao Zhen had six sons: Cao Shuang, Cao Xi (曹羲), Cao Xun (曹訓), Cao Ze (曹則), Cao Yan (曹彥) and Cao Ai (曹皚). Among them, Cao Shuang inherited his father's peerage and marquisate as the Marquis of Shaoling (邵陵侯), while the other five also had their own marquis titles and marquisates. In 239, before Cao Rui died, he appointed Cao Shuang and Sima Yi as regents for his underage adopted son, Cao Fang, who succeeded him as the third emperor of Wei. In 249, Sima Yi staged a \"coup d'état\" against Cao Shuang and successfully seized power from him. After the \"coup d'état\", Cao Shuang and his brothers were convicted of treason and executed along with their entire families.\n\nCao Zhen appears as a character in the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", which romanticises the historical figures and events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. He makes a late first appearance in Chapter 84 when he accompanies Cao Pi on a campaign against Eastern Wu.\n\nCao Zhen starts to play a more important role from Chapter 91 onwards when the Shu regent Zhuge Liang launches the Northern Expeditions against Wei. His contributions in the series of battles against Shu are largely downplayed because the author, Luo Guanzhong, wanted to accentuate Sima Yi's resourcefulness and effectively portray him as Zhuge Liang's nemesis. Luo Guanzhong even attributed Cao Zhen's death to his failure to heed Sima Yi's forewarning of a Shu offensive.\n\nIn Chapter 100, Sima Yi warns Cao Zhen that Shu forces will, within the next ten days, launch an attack on Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu), a strategic location which would allow further incursions into the Wei heartland. After Cao Zhen refuses to believe Sima Yi, the two make a bet and each of them leads half of the Wei army to guard the valleys to the east and west of Mount Qi. Cao Zhen prepares for battle halfheartedly as he thinks that he is right. Seven days later, when his scouts report that a small number of Shu soldiers are approaching the valley, Cao Zhen sends his subordinate Qin Liang (秦良) to lead 5,000 men to survey the terrain. As Qin Liang and his men travel deeper into the valley, they fall into an ambush by Shu forces led by Liao Hua and Guan Xing and are completely destroyed. The Shu forces then disguise themselves by wearing the Wei soldiers' armour and uniform and infiltrate Cao Zhen's camp. In the meantime, Sima Yi encounters and defeats Shu forces led by Wei Yan. When he learns that no enemy forces have been spotted at Cao Zhen's side, he immediately leads his troops to Cao Zhen's camp. By then, the Shu infiltrators have launched a surprise attack within Cao Zhen's camp. Sima Yi shows up in time, drives back the Shu forces, and saves Cao Zhen. Cao Zhen feels so ashamed of himself that he falls sick. Zhuge Liang writes a letter to Cao Zhen to taunt and insult him. Cao Zhen becomes so angry after reading the letter that he coughs blood and dies that night in his camp. Sima Yi sends his dead body back to Luoyang, where he receives a proper burial.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1921393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921393", "title": "Sima Shi", "text": "Sima Shi\n\nSima Shi () (208 – 23 March 255), courtesy name Ziyuan, was a military general and regent of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. In 249, he assisted his father Sima Yi in overthrowing the emperor Cao Fang's regent Cao Shuang, allowing the Sima family to become paramount authority in the state, and he inherited his father's authority after his father's death in 251. He maintained a tight grip on the political scene and, when the emperor, Cao Fang, considered action against him in 254, had him deposed and replaced with his cousin, Cao Mao. This tight grip eventually allowed him to, at the time of his death in 255 after just having quelled a rebellion, transition his power to his younger brother, Sima Zhao, whose son Sima Yan eventually usurped the throne and established the Jin dynasty.\n\nAfter Sima Yan became emperor, he, recognising Sima Shi's role in his own imperial status, posthumously honoured his uncle as Emperor Jing of Jin (景帝), with the temple name Shizong (世宗).\n\nSima Shi was born in 208. He was Sima Yi's oldest son, born of Sima Yi's wife, Zhang Chunhua (張春華). When he was young, he was known for the elegance in his conduct and his intelligence, earning him a reputation equal to that of Xiahou Xuan and He Yan, with He Yan having gone as far as to once state: \"The only person who could have the great achievements under the heaven is probably Sima Ziyuan.\" As his father was an important Wei official, Sima Shi himself climbed up the ranks of officials fairly rapidly. Between the years of 237 and 239, Sima Shi was appointed as Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary (散騎常侍), and received some promotions to the post of Military Protector of the Palace (中護軍).\n\nWhen Sima Yi started planning a coup d'état against Cao Shuang; according to the \"Jin Shu\", Sima Yi confided only in Sima Shi, excluding even Shi's younger brother Sima Zhao from the discussion (although Sima Guang found this unlikely and, in his \"Zizhi Tongjian\", opined that Sima Yi planned the coup with both Sima Shi and Sima Zhao). Sima Shi put together a group of 3,000 loyal men without knowledge by Cao Shuang or his associates, and when Sima Yi set to carry out his plans in 249, Sima Shi was able to quickly summon the men to carry out the coup.\n\nOnce Sima Yi overthrew Cao Shuang and became the sole regent for the emperor, Cao Fang, he rewarded his son with the title Marquess of Changpingxiang, a large fief of 1,000 households, and shortly thereafter, the rank of General of the Guards (衛將軍). Sima Shi became his father's assistant, although there was no particular record of his accomplishments during these years. After Sima Yi died in 251, he took over his father's positions without significant opposition—after his father had, earlier that year, suppressed a failed rebellion by Wang Ling (王淩) and massacred the clans of Wang and his associates.\n\nSima Shi would go on to rule the government effectively and impartially, ordering that all officials recommend talents to him, that they define the hierarchical ranks, take care of the impoverished and the orphaned, and deal with the delayed personnel affairs.\n\nShortly after his father's death, the emperor appointed him to the position of General-in-Chief Who Pacifies the Army (撫軍大將軍). In late 251, Deng Ai, the Grand Administrator of Chengyang, submitted a memorial to the court in which he stated that the Xiongnu under Liu Bao were growing too powerful, and therefore proposed a method of giving the Xiongnu under Liu Bao titles and awards, so as to divide and weaken them, and to further settle them somewhere further away from the Chinese citizens and to reeducate them on Chinese cultural traditions, a proposal to which Sima Shi agreed to. \nAt around the start of 252, Sima Shi was further promoted to the position of General-in-Chief (大將軍), while also being bestowed upon a post as Palace Attendant (侍中), effectively giving him all control of the armies stationed both in and outside the palace. He was also given authority over the Imperial Secretariat (錄尚書事). \n\nIt was once proposed to him to alter the existing constitutions, to which he responded: \"A poet used to praise those who ‘abide by the principles of the Heavenly Lord and appear as if they know nothing themselves’. The institutions and rules devised by ancestors of the Three Dynasties should be complied with. If there is no war, there should be no reforms in haste.\"\n\nSima Shi was a capable politician and administrator, but he also quickly wanted to prove his military reputation. Towards the end of 252, he launched a major attack against Eastern Wu, whose founding emperor, Sun Quan, had recently died and whose current emperor, Sun Liang, was under the regency of Zhuge Ke. Zhuge Ke was able to deal Sima Shi's forces, headed by Sima Zhao, a major blow at the Battle of Dongxing, but Sima Shi maintained himself well by making humble admissions of faults to the public and promoting the generals who tried to stop his campaign. In 253, after Sima Shi defeated Zhuge Ke in a major battle, his reputation was established, while Zhuge Ke's own was undermined (due to Zhuge Ke's failure to admit fault), and Zhuge Ke soon fell while Sima Shi's power was affirmed.\n\nIn 254, Sima Shi made a violent move to consolidate his power, at Cao Fang's expense. Cao Fang had aligned himself with the minister Li Feng (李豐), and Sima Shi had growing suspicions that they were plotting against him. He summoned and interrogated Li Feng, and when Li refused to disclose his conversations with the emperor, Sima Shi beat him to death with a sword handle and then accused Li Feng and his friends Xiahou Xuan (夏侯玄) and Zhang Ji (張緝) of treason, and had them and their families summarily executed. Cao Fang was further forced to depose his wife Empress Zhang, who was Zhang Ji's daughter. These moves further terrorised the officials into submission.\nCao Fang was very angry about the deaths of Li Feng and Zhang Ji, and later in 254, his associates submitted a plan to him—that when Sima Shi's brother Sima Zhao would arrive at the palace for an official visit before heading to his defense post at Chang'an, to kill Sima Zhao and seize his troops, and to then use those troops to attack Sima Shi. Cao Fang was apprehensive and paralysed, and did not implement the plan, but news was still leaked to Sima Shi. Sima Shi then forced Cao Fang to step down, although Sima Shi spared his life and gave him his old title of Prince of Qi. When Sima Shi notified Cao Fang's stepmother, Empress Dowager Guo, that he intended to make Cao Pi's brother Cao Ju, the Prince of Pengcheng, emperor, she managed to persuade him that such a succession would be improper—that since Cao Ju was the uncle of her husband, Cao Rui, such a succession would leave Cao Rui effectively sonless with no heir. Sima Shi was forced to agree with her, and he made, as she suggested, Cao Mao emperor instead. Cao Mao, although 14 years old at the time, was known for his intelligence, and Empress Dowager Guo might have believed that he, alone of the princes and dukes, might have had a chance of counteracting the Simas.\n\nDespite Empress Dowager Guo's intentions and Cao Mao's own intelligence, they made very little impact in trying to stem the tide of the Simas' growing power. In reaction to the removal of Cao Fang, the general Guanqiu Jian, in 255, as the commander in the important eastern city of Shouchun (壽春; in present-day Lu'an, Anhui), along with another general Wen Qin (文欽), raised a rebellion against the Simas, but were quickly crushed by Sima Shi's army. Guanqiu Jian was killed, and his clan was slaughtered. Wen Qin and his sons fled to Eastern Wu.\n\nThe campaign had its tolls on Sima Shi, however. He was ill with an eye disorder at the time that Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin's rebellion started, and had just had an eye surgery. He was initially therefore reluctant to lead the forces himself and wanted his uncle, Sima Fu, to lead the forces against Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin. At the urging of Wang Su, Fu Gu (傅嘏), and Zhong Hui, he led the troops himself, which was important in the victory against Guanqiu Jian, but during one of the raids made by Wen Qin's son Wen Yang (文鴦), Sima Shi, in his anxiety, aggravated the eye that he had just had the operation in—causing his eye to pop out—and his conditions soon deteriorated greatly. Less than a month after he put down the rebellion, he died while at Xuchang (許昌; in present-day Xuchang, Henan), with his brother Sima Zhao in attendance to succeed him.\n\nSima Shi first appears as a playable character in the seventh instalment of Koei's \"Dynasty Warriors\" video games series.\n\n\n"}

Wentworth was founded in 1904 and offers career-focused education through its 19 bachelor's degree programs as well as master's degrees.\n\nIn 1903, Boston businessman Arioch Wentworth left the bulk of his estate, estimated at $7 million, for the purpose of founding an industrial school within the city. Accordingly, a board of seven directors incorporated Wentworth Institute on April 5, 1904, as a school \"to furnish education in the mechanical arts\". The directors spent several years investigating the educational needs of the community, increased the endowment ($3.5 million at the time), and reached a settlement with Wentworth's daughter, who had contested his will. The campus was established in Boston's Back Bay Fens, and Arthur L. Williston was hired as the first principal of the college.\n\nOn September 25, 1911, Wentworth opened its doors as a technical school to 242 students. The school quickly gained enrollment and by 1919, it had 1,800 students in day and evening programs and 45 teachers. In 1953, Wentworth named its first president, H. Russell Beatty. Wentworth became a degree-granting institution in 1957 and began awarding its first baccalaureate-level degrees in 1970. Wentworth began a transition from a commuter college to a residential college in the 1960s, with the addition of several residence halls.\n\nIn 1972, the Institute admitted its first female students. By 2005, women represented 21% of the academic population. In 1975, cooperative education programs were introduced at Wentworth. In 1973, Wentworth instructors unionized to join the American Federation of Teachers and on October 28, 1977, the teachers of Wentworth went on strike. Until 1977, the college's lower and upper divisions operated as two separate schools, when they merged and the Wentworth Institute of Technology was created. With admissions numbers growing, Wentworth expanded by acquiring the former Ira Allen School building from the city of Boston in 1980, and the former Boston Trade High School in 1983.\n\nMajor renovations to the third floor of Annex Hall were constructed in 1989 at a cost of $1 million to add architectural studios and facilities, and Wentworth gained accreditation from the National Architectural Accrediting Board in 1991. In 1993, Wentworth introduced a pair of five-year engineering programs to the curriculum: electromechanical engineering, and environmental science. In 2002, these programs received initial accreditation from the Engineering Accreditation Commission.\n\nIn 2001 and 2005 Wentworth opened new residence halls with 473 and 360 beds respectively, ending Wentworth's status as a majority commuter school.\n\nOn June 8, 2005, Zorica Pantic was announced as Wentworth's fourth president. She assumed office on August 1, 2005, as the first female engineer to head an institute of technology. Her inaugural ceremony was held on April 5, 2006. President Pantic, announced on February 20, 2017 that she would be stepping down from the role of President on May 31, 2019.\n\nIn November 2009, Wentworth became a master's degree-granting institution, with the creation and accreditation of its Master of Architecture program. Since then, several other master's programs have been added to the curriculum.\n\nWentworth received approval for “university” status from the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education in July 2017. As required by the Code of the Massachusetts Regulations, the Institute has established graduate programs in four “distinct professional fields of study” and has demonstrated that it has “faculty, facilities, and resources necessary to support sound graduate programs.” Despite being accredited as a university, school officials announced that the school's name would remain \"Wentworth Institute of Technology.\" \n\nWentworth has academic departments dedicated to applied mathematics, architecture, biomedical engineering, civil engineering and technology, computer science and computer networking, construction management, cybersecurity, electrical engineering and technology, humanities and social sciences, industrial design, interdisciplinary engineering, interior design, management, mechanical engineering and technology, and sciences. Wentworth offers bachelor's degrees in 18 engineering, technology, design and management majors. As a fundamental part of Wentworth education, the Institute requires students to complete two cooperative education semesters in work placements.\n\nAccelerate is Wentworth's Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center. Incorporated in May 2012, Accelerate hosts a series of programs and workshops with the goal of nurturing a culture of innovation and entrepreneurial thinking among students. In its first four years, more than 3,500 Wentworth students participated in Accelerate and established 650 product ideas as part of interdisciplinary teams. Students received mentoring from more than 100 alumni and professionals and 42 Accelerate teams were funded for a total of $167,000.\n\nThe Wentworth campus is located in the Fenway neighborhood of Boston. It consists primarily of 15 buildings for administrative and faculty offices, classrooms, laboratories, library, and athletic facilities. Students enrolled for full-time study may live in one of nine residence halls near the main campus buildings. The main buildings are on Huntington Avenue, and are served by two stations of the MBTA Green Line \"E\" Branch. In the Fall of 2016, the newly renovated Douglas D. Schumann Library & Learning Commons opened, a modern learning space which aims to forward student collaboration. The library is named for Wentworth alum Douglass Schumann, whose $5 million gift kick-started the renovation. The facility includes a number of private rooms that can be booked by students or faculty for meetings, project collaboration or study.\n\nThe Institute's collaborating neighbors include the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, Northeastern University, the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, and the Museum of Fine Arts. Wentworth is a member of the Colleges of the Fenway consortium, and shares many facilities and activities with nearby institutions. The campus is adjacent to the Mission Hill section of Boston's Roxbury neighborhood, which is popular for off-campus housing, for dining out, and for community service volunteering.\n\nThe Center for Community and Learning Partnerships supports neighborhood concerns while enhancing the educational and professional environment at Wentworth. It is the hub for community service, service learning, and college access and success initiatives at the Institute.\nProjects and programs facilitated through the Center during the 2007–08 academic year engaged more than 1,800 students who contributed 116,000 hours to community-based work and service. According to the Independent Sector and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a volunteer hour in Massachusetts was valued at $25.47 in 2007. Based on this figure, Wentworth's service efforts had an estimated economic impact of approximately $3 million for the 2007–08 academic year.\n\nWentworth's civic engagement work garnered national recognition in 2008, earning the Elective Classification for Campus and Community Engagement from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.\n\nMost Wentworth students are US citizens or permanent residents. The Institute also has international students from Asia, Latin America, and Europe. Most students choose on-campus housing, which creates a large, diverse residential community.\n\nA larger portion of the student body has historically been composed of male students. To balance this, the Institute has placed an emphasis on female applicants and has a number of programs and areas dedicated to women. Resources for women include the Women's Center (a designated female lounge), the Woman to Woman Program, and the establishment of the Society of Women Engineers on campus. More women entering fields such as architecture and engineering has led to more female applicants and female enrollment has recently increased.\n\nTotal enrollment (2018): 4,516 total (4,341 undergraduate and 175 graduate students)\n\nWentworth's athletics programs include 17 varsity, two club, and six intramural sports, emphasizing both men's and women's sports. The athletic program competes as a Division III member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and holds memberships in the Commonwealth Coast Conference (CCC), the Great Northeast Athletic Conference (GNAC), and the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC).\n\nSince 1989, the Leopards have captured 24 conference championships in Men's Volleyball, Baseball, Men's Basketball, Hockey, Golf, Men's Soccer, Men's Tennis, Men's Cross Country, and Women's Soccer. Wentworth has earned an invitation to the NCAA Division III Tournament 9 times (Men's Basketball: 1997 and 2007; Hockey: 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004; Men's Volleyball: 2016, 2017; Women's Soccer 2016) in the last 20 years. Wentworth received ECAC Tournament bids in baseball, men's basketball, hockey, lacrosse, men's soccer and women's soccer within the last 12 years.\n\nA multi-purpose athletic field, a gift from Myles Sweeney '28 and his wife, Eugenia, opened in 1996. Sweeney Field is in front of the main building of the Institute - Wentworth Hall. Since 1996, the men's and women's soccer teams have enjoyed a combined home record of 81-27-2 (75% won).\n\nIndividual student-athletes have garnered numerous all-league, rookie of the year, and player of the year honors throughout Wentworth's history, with 11 Academic All-America honorees including the Division III softball Academic All-America in 2015.\n\n\n"}

O'Toole was drama critic for the \"New York Daily News\" from 1997 to 2001 and is a regular contributor to \"The New York Review of Books\". He is an author, literary critic, historical writer, and political commentator. His recent books have focused on the rise, fall, and aftermath of Ireland's Celtic Tiger. He has been a strong critic of political corruption in Ireland throughout his career.\n\nO'Toole was born in Dublin, grew up in a working-class family, and was educated at University College Dublin. In 2011, he was named by \"The Observer\" as one of \"Britain's top 300 intellectuals\", although he does not live in the UK and was one of five on the list who would not claim to be British. In 2012 and 2013 O'Toole was a visiting lecturer in Irish letters at Princeton University, and contributed to the Fund for Irish Studies Series.\n\nO'Toole was born in Dublin and was educated at Scoil Íosagáin and Coláiste Chaoimhín in Crumlin (both run by the Christian Brothers) and at University College Dublin, where he studied English and philosophy.\n\nSoon after graduation, he became drama critic of \"In Dublin\" magazine in 1980. He joined the \"Sunday Tribune\" on its relaunch by Vincent Browne in 1983, and worked as its drama critic, literary editor, arts editor, and feature writer. From 1986 to 1987 he edited \"Magill\" magazine.\n\nHe joined \"The Irish Times\" as a columnist in 1988 and his columns have appeared twice-weekly ever since. He took a sabbatical in 1990–1991 to work as literary adviser to the Abbey Theatre. In 1994 he was one of the presenters for the last season of BBC TV's \"The Late Show\". From 1997 to 2001 he was drama critic of the \"Daily News\" in New York. In 2011, he was appointed as literary editor of \"The Irish Times\". He also has published articles regularly in the \"New York Review of Books\".\n\nIn 1999, Fintan O'Toole published an article about the Serbian war crimes against Albanian civilians in Kosovo mentioning, among other publications Trotsky being shocked by the \"\"viciousness of the assault on the general Albanian population which followed Serbia's invasion and annexation of Kosovo in 1912\"\".\n\nO'Toole has criticised what he sees as negative attitudes toward immigration in Ireland, the state of Ireland's public services, growing inequality during Ireland's economic boom, the Iraq War, and the U.S. military's use of Shannon Airport, among many other issues. In 2006, he spent six months reporting for \"The Irish Times\" in China.\n\nHis former editor, Geraldine Kennedy, was paid more than the editor of the UK's top non-tabloid newspaper, \"The Daily Telegraph\", which has a circulation about nine times that of \"The Irish Times\". Later, O'Toole told a rival Irish paper, the \"Sunday Independent\": \nWe as a paper are not shy of preaching about corporate pay and fat cats but with this there is a sense of excess. Some of the sums mentioned are disturbing. This is not an attack on Ms Kennedy, it is an attack on the executive level of pay. There is double standard of seeking more job cuts while paying these vast salaries.\n\nIn June 2012, O'Toole compared the Irish Constitutional Convention to the American Citizens Union, a reformist political organisation that the New York City political machine Tammany Hall did not bother suppressing so long as it did not threaten its hegemony.\n\nIn August 2019, after the selection of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, O'Toole proposed to get Parliament to back an alternative Cabinet who would push back the October deadline for Brexit to allow a trade deal to be negotiated. The proposal required seven Sinn Féin MPs in northern Irish border constituencies to resign in favor of a pact between the four largest anti-Brexit parties in Ireland, thereby triggering by-elections at a certain date in mid-September. O’Toole believed they would result in a more hardline anti-Brexit parliamentary faction that would make a stronger case for a no-confidence vote in Johnson. The proposal received sharp criticism from Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, who claimed the existing anti-Brexit factions in Parliament were strong enough without the party making too many policy concessions.\n\nA June 26, 2018 column in The Irish Times by O'Toole examined how the Trump administration's policies as well as public-facing communications concerning immigration and asylum-seekers from Mexico may be deliberately calculated to bring elements of fascism to the world's leading democracy.\n\nAn April 2020 column in The Irish Times by O'Toole asserted that the destruction of the public image and reputation of the United States by Donald Trump culminated with his bungling of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, and that now, pity was the only appropriate feeling for the American people, the majority of whom had not voted for him.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Castle Technology later released the Iyonix PC in November 2002, the first desktop computer to use the Intel XScale microarchitecture and then bought the rights to the RISC OS Technology from Pace in July 2003.\n\nAfter Acorn withdrew from the desktop computer industry in 1998, Castle Technology acquired the rights to produce the A7000, A7000+ and RISC PC using the \"Acorn\" brand.\n\nThe Iyonix PC (codenamed \"Tungsten\") was developed as a set-top unit (STU) in secret by engineers at Pace's Shipley campus along with a 32-bit version of RISC OS 4 (known as RISC OS 5). When management discovered the project the campus was closed.\n\nCastle Technology acquired the proposed designs and the original engineers from Pace to further develop the Tungsten into a desktop computer. Robert Sprowson, the original hardware designer, declined to join Castle Technology and so Peter Wild was recruited.\n\nThe Iyonix PC was released six months later. Although it was well received, it was not designed for long-term production and therefore used some components that were near obsolete when it was released.\n\nA problem for the Iyonix PC was that it used leaded components which were outlawed with the adoption of Directive 2002/95/EC in February 2003 by the European Union. However, by this time Castle Technology was financially troubled and could not afforded to re-engineer the Iyonix PC without the leaded components. The remaining Iyonix stock were passed to Iyonix Limited which stopped distribution on 30 September 2008.\nIn 2018 RISC OS Developments acquired Castle Technology Ltd including the Intellectual Property.\n\nIn 2004, Castle Technology acquired Tematic to further development of RISC OS in embedded systems.\n\nIn December 2005, Castle Technology moved its main office to the former premises of its software development division, following the migration of Tematic to a neighbouring premises in Signet Court, Cambridge.\n"}

{"id": "1921431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921431", "title": "Media activism", "text": "Media activism\n\nMedia activism is a broad category of activism that utilizes media and communication technologies for social and political movements. Methods of media activism include publishing news on websites, creating video and audio investigations, spreading information about protests, or organizing campaigns relating to media and communications policies.\n\nMedia activism is used for many different purposes. It is often a tool for grassroots activists and anarchists to spread information not available via mainstream media or to share censored news stories. Certain forms of politically motivated hacking and net-based campaigns are also considered media activism. Typically, the purpose of media activism is to spread awareness through media communications which sometimes leads to action.\n\nSocial media is often used as a form of media activism. Because of the interactive features and widespread adoption, users can quickly disseminate information and rally supporters. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter can reach a much larger audience than traditional media. Although often only a small percentage of people who express interest in a cause online are willing to commit to offline action, social media interaction is viewed as \"the first step in a ladder of engagement\".\"Social media has helped us organize without having leaders,\" said Victor Damaso, 22, demonstrating on São Paulo's main Paulista Avenue on Thursday night. \"Our ideas, our demands are discussed on Facebook. There are no meetings, no rules\".\n\nLive streams applications or websites such as Livestream is another media form which can replace TV when there is a kind of censorship. The protests in Istanbul can be an example of this way of broadcasting in terms of the lack of the objectivity of the actual media and the television.\nOn the other hand, a lot of protestors used Whatsapp or the Walkie-Talkie application with their smartphones in order to improve communication between protestors during the manifestations thanks to its quick and instantaneous sharing of information. Moreover, the usage of applications such as Whatsapp can improve organization among protestors with added features such as group message. Similarly, YouTube is another efficient tool of spreading information and is generally used with other social media forms such as Facebook and Twitter.\n\nCulture jamming, another form of media activism, is a subversive strategy of protest that re-appropriates the tropes of mainstream media \"in order to take advantage of the resources and venues they afford\".\n\nMedia activism has expanded its scope to include fields of study such as journalism and news media. Media activism additionally educates the audience to be producers of their own media. Media activism to be expanded to facilitate action through media production and involvement.\n\nSocial Media has become a primary organizing tool for political and social movements globally. They serve to strengthen already existing networks of political and social relationships among activists offline. Media activism among youth can be linked to the way youth protest and create communities online over specific issues and social connections.\n\nChina has strong censorship laws in place, where the press freedoms are not considered free, rather oppressive. Youth in China have worked towards stronger press freedoms online and a dedication to utilizing the principles of media activism. Intensive civic conversation occurs online in China. Youth satirized the government through what came to be known as \"the River Crab critique,\" in turn spurring civic conversation on the internet. Media Activists in China used their online presence and freedom to alter images, such as Marilyn Monroe, to have the face of Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong. This image was coined as Maorilyn Maoroe, which in the image is juxtaposed next to a homophone for profanity. \"Maorilyn Maoroe\" was an opponent to the societal River Crab, which is a pun on \"harmonious,\" a principle that Chinese censorship was created to promote, but has failed to do so.\n\nIn China, youth and other media activists have discovered and utilized new methods to indirectly criticize the political and societal environments, going around the government censorship. Social media is among the newest method of critique. Activists use \"microblogs\" to critique the government. Blogging can therefore be seen as a media activist approach to civic participation within the bounds of government censorship.\n\nThe 2011 Arab Spring uprisings made extensive use of social media activism within the countries of Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. These nations concentrated on the ability of the society to operate social media and begin organizing a grassroots initiative for a globalized form of democracy. Arab youth population are described as \"opening\" societies through social media in places where governments are otherwise repressive.\n\nEgyptian protesters utilized social media to reduce the difficulties and cost associated with organizing rallies and a readily-mobilized political force. This facilitation of assembly through social media allowed the creation of new gateways for civic engagement where Egypt had suppressed such opportunities under emergency power for the last 30 years. This facilitation of assembly through social media allowed the creation of new gateways for civic engagement where Egypt had suppressed such opportunities under emergency power for the last 30 years. This uprising led to violent conflict within each of the nations, and can thus media and media activism can be viewed as a fundamental contributor to the nation's new national identity under a new rule.\n\nThe Philippines was once said to have the freest press in Southeast Asia, after the ousting of Ferdinand Marcos, due to the subsequent rapid expansion of newspapers, radio stations, and programming throughout the country. This has changed over the years, especially after events such as the Maguindanao massacre, where 34 journalists were killed in a single event. Competing interests within traditional media also complicate the landscape of journalistic transparency—a number of the country's largest newspapers are owned by a few select families who compete in both business and politics. In response, local organizations have turned to alternative forms of information dissemination. For example, indigenous groups in the Philippines have developed their online media presence in order to build international awareness of local issues—such as land grabbing—since local corporations and political powers and influence over the mainstream media.\n\nIn 2010, Mary Jane Veloso, an overseas Filipino domestic worker, was arrested and convicted in Indonesia for attempting to smuggle 5.7lb of heroin. She was placed on death row and was initially set to be executed. Human rights organizations claimed that Veloso was used by her recruiters as a drug mule and should be given the opportunity to defend herself in court. Through a joint effort of legal advocacy and online media activism, Veloso's execution was delayed. The petition on Change.org to support her was one of the fastest-growing and most signed online petitions from the region.\n\nMedia activism has a long history in the United States including the revolutionary pamphleteers of the Revolutionary War, the abolitionist press in the decades leading up to the Civil War and the socialist press during the years of the labor movement such as \"The Appeal to Reason\" which supported the presidential candidate Eugene Debs.\n\nThe Occupy Wall Street movement, which began during the fall of 2011, is another instance were social media largely contributed to the efforts of the initiative. It was a people powered movement beginning September 17, 2011 in Liberty Square in Manhattans financial district. As Occupy Wall Street sprang up in parks and under tents, one of the main issues the protesters pushed was economic inequality. Then with the winter pressing forward the police swept the protesters away. All across the country the crowds began to thin and enthusiasm diminished, and eventually the movement all but dissolved. The catch phrase that became well known by the occupants was \"We are the 99 percent.” The 99 percent were referred to as the lower-income people that are struggling to make a change. This was in contrast to the 1% who were well off financially and were in control of social, political and economic levers of powers. From here it spread to cities all over the United State, and globally. The movement came about because of the popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. Its main goal was to fight against the unequal income gap and the corrupting influence of money. Although many people believed that the movement disappeared, it has instead evolved into a variety of different causes. One of Occupies largest unrecognized victories is the drive for a higher minimum wage. The occupy protests helped to motivate workers in the fast food industry in New York City to walk off their jobs in November, 2012, triggering national movement to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. This march in New York helped lead the way for tens of thousands of workers who marched in hundreds of cities asking for better paying conditions. Occupy Wall Street protesters capitalized on the tools of social media to spread awareness about the movement, to inform participants about organized meetings, rallies, and events, and to ultimately generate national news and mainstream media attention. Social media handles like Facebook and Twitter were used to bring people from all over to one place for an agreed upon cause. It started off with the small number of people who had the idea. Once the events, rallies and protests began, it gained the attention from mass media. This ultimately created a huge platform for the change these participants yearned for.\n\nBlack Lives Matter, a campaign against violence and systemic racism towards African Americans, has been influenced strongly by Social Media Activism with leaders, hashtags, and policy proposals brought forward because of Social Media. The hashtag #blacklivesmatter was created in 2013 by Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi after the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the murder in Florida of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin. Garza wrote a Facebook post titled \"A Love Note to Black People\" in which she said: \"Our Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter.” Once the hashtag was formed, it has been a rallying cry for various organizing efforts across the country centered on Black lives.\n\nIt is a movement that brings the African American community together. It is a campaign that does not promote violence but instead unity. There can be both negative or positive views on the movement due to the way the media affects people. This movement began in 2013 when people started hash tagging #BLM, #BlackLivesMatter, and #equality on Twitter, Facebook, and many social media platforms. In response to the visible violent acts against Black communities more than 50 organizations from across the country have come together to fight this unfairness based on color. Today this is still an issue, and in some peoples' opinion media does not have a positive effect on BLM. It causes people to riot and build more hatred for each other instead of the whole concept of unity. Sometimes the media, which has fake news can take things out of context, in result people will have an upsetting reaction.\n\nAfrican Americans use Twitter at a higher rate than their white counterparts with 22 percent of online blacks using the service in 2014 compared to 16 percent of online whites. Hashtags such as #OscarsSoWhite, #handsupdontshoot, and #icantbreathe have sprung up as offshoots in the social movement and have helped create a subculture on the website that some have called “Black Twitter”. Jelani Cobb, professor of Journalism at Columbia University, has argued that that “Black Twitter” has been as vital to Black Lives Matter as television was for the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nCitizen reporting on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook help drive the coverage of traditional media on stories of violence, discrimination, and harassment.\n\nThe ALS Ice Bucket Challenge was a form of media activism that swept through online communities to bring awareness to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease, a fatal disease which causes damage to a person's motor functions through the break down of nerve cells. The challenge involves pouring a bucket of cold water over a person's head, and donating to the ALS Association. It began in July 2014, when Chris Kennedy first challenged his sister, Jeanette Senerchia, to participate in the challenge. Senerchia was inspired to partake in order to support her husband who had previously been diagnosed with the disease. Soon the challenge became widespread across mainstream media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The challenge picked up a mass following due to the amount of lives touched by the disease and the desire to see progress in the fight against ALS. The accumulation of donations made by supporters of the cause resulted in as much as $115 million being donated to the ALS Association in an effort to find a cure and bring awareness to the cause.\n\nJoseph Kony was the leader of Uganda's Lords Resistance Army (LRA) in 2012. He was accused of abducting over 60,000 Ugandan children, turning the boys into brainwashed killing machines and the young girls into sex slaves. He killed anyone who stood in his way. In 2012, an American charity named \"Invisible Children\" took Kony's actions and turned them into a short film, posting it on YouTube. It was the fastest growing viral video of all time, receiving over 100 million views in the span of 6 days. Kony had been wanted by the International Criminal Court since 2005 for crimes against humanity. After gaining so much attention from social media sites like YouTube and Twitter, the U.S. finally declares the LRA a terrorist group in 2008. They even sent 100 of their own troops to support Uganda in tracking Kony and taking him down. Hundreds of thousands of people tweeted with the hashtag \"#stopkony\". The Kony video resulted in never before seen international efforts to end Africa's longest lasting issue. The video incorporated people form all over the world who probably had no idea this problem was occurring otherwise. It proved that if people knew about an issue and were given the opportunity to help, they in fact would. Social justice campaigns have been using new media strategies to communicate to the public. Things like online distribution, podcasts and the new cultural norm of social media have been fused with the traditional rallies, protests and lobbying efforts and have created a new type of change that is somewhat convenient for its followers. These new social platforms have made it possible for the public to be both the consumer and producer of media, making their efforts for change reach numbers of people at never before seen speed, like the Kony video.\n\nToday nearly 32 percent of Venezuelan internet-users utilize social media on regular basis.\n\nMost recently, social media has been used politically to achieve success during elections, including the 2012 re-election campaign of President Hugo Chávez and the 2013 presidential campaign between Nicolás Maduro and Henrique Capriles Radonski. Social media was used to organize rallies and political platforms and affected campaign content. Opposition candidate Capriles used social media as an activist approach to \"drum up\" support and connect with voters politically. This form of media activism connected most dominantly in the Venezuelan youth population—a generation considered to be tech-savvy.\n\nOn March 14, 2013, Lourdes Alicia Ortega Pérez was imprisoned by the Scientific Penal and Criminal Investigation Corps of Venezuela for tweeting a message that was considered \"destabilizing to the country\".\n\nRotuman in Fiji, the Rotuman people are deemed the minority, causing vast outmigration of nearly 80 percent of the population. Digital communication is relied on heavily to conserve the Rotuman culture. The communication aspects of digital media are of great benefit. The use of digital media allows the Rotuman people to remain in touch and conserve their culture.\n\nScholars have attempted to create theoretical frameworks to illustrate the use of media within social movements and activism.\n\nOne example is the four-stage model for political movements using social media created by Rodrigo Sandoval-Almazan and J. Roman Gil-Garcia.\n\nLimitations of social media activism have also been pointed out by scholars. Some critics argue that media activism and internet activism still require the coverage of traditional mass media outlets in order to gain significant traction. Social movements, especially ones rooted in online social media, also require a critical mass of participants in order to sustain the presence on social media platforms.\n\nA study of the protests and media activism sparked by the 2009 Iranian presidential election also suggests that digital creations and media have to be emotionally moving in order to in order to spur civic engagement and mobilization of citizens.\n\nMedia activism has also provided an opportunity for Indigenous peoples to address issues of local government inadequacy. Through the usage of media technology and online communication, Indigenous groups are able to reach out further than their specific localities and build solidarity with other national minorities who face similar issues. Indigenous groups in the Philippines have been able to use online media to debunk stereotypes propagated in national media and to communicate their causes and claims with an international audience. Media activism also allows indigenous groups to mobilize external support from international allies, especially when local conditions become too dangerous to mobilize locally, due cases of political harassment or extrajudicial killings. Agents of media in terms of activism, are a doubled edged sword which indicate the historic importance, while also laying stepping stones for its significance in the future. Similarly, indigenous life writing is a phenomenon which not only signifies its historic importance but also lays the foundation for the future white settler conception of colonialism and a medium to secure land rights for the indigenous.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people use social media at higher rates than non-Indigenous Australians. As a form of activism, they use social media and especially memes, to challenge dominant views of Australian history. In a comprehensive study of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social media use, Bronwyn Carlson and Ryan Frazer found that many people experience unpleasant interactions like trolling and racism, but still value social media: “For many, it had become an invaluable tool in the realisation of their hopes and dreams; it helped them ‘find’ and share their identities and produce intimate communities of mutual trust, respect, care and kindness.” Social media is an important tool for developing activists’ collective identities.\n\nIn light of the benefits of media activism, there are those who oppose the usage of it as an organizing tool. One caveat of technology is that those in power can use the internet to track down and target activists. Dominant elites, or those challenged by media activism, have tried to push back by filtering the internet, blocking specific websites, decreasing the connection speeds, and tracking users who view political information.\n\nStates such as North Korea, Venezuela, and China have attempted to curtail media activism through a variety of tactics. The Chinese state engages in media censorship in the name of national harmony, although the Council on Foreign Relations argues that suppression of online activism is to protect authorities' political or economic interests. In North Korea, the state curtails virtually all forms of digital communication, but a few transnational citizen-journalists have used technology like cell phones and thumb drives to communicate accurate news to citizens and abroad.\n\nAlthough media activism is a form of activism it is not a form of high risk activism, more a form of organization through communication. Slacktivism is a term coined to emphasize on the lack of action media activism enrolls, through engaging in the talk of social issues but not reacting. Critics argue that media activism does not seem to be the most efficient engine in taking action towards social regimes, however many recognize it as a powerful tool of communication to connect like minded populations.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1921444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921444", "title": "Affective fallacy", "text": "Affective fallacy\n\nAffective fallacy is a term from literary criticism used to refer to the supposed error of judging or evaluating a text on the basis of its emotional effects on a reader. The term was coined by W.K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley in 1949 as a principle of New Criticism which is often paired with their study of \"The Intentional Fallacy\".\n\nThe concept of affective fallacy is an answer to the idea of impressionistic criticism, which argues that the reader's response to a poem is the ultimate indication of its value. It is the antithesis of affective criticism, which is the practice of evaluating the effect that a literary work has on its reader or audience. The concept was presented after the authors had presented their paper on \"The Intentional Fallacy\".\n\nFirst defined in an article published in \"The Sewanee Review\" in 1946, the concept of an affective fallacy was most clearly articulated in \"The Verbal Icon\", Wimsatt's collection of essays published in 1954. Wimsatt used the term to refer to all forms of criticism that understood a text's effect upon the reader to be the primary route to analyzing the importance and success of that text. This definition of the fallacy, if strictly followed, touches on or wholly includes nearly all of the major modes of literary criticism, from Ovid's \"docere delictendo\" (to teach by delighting), Aristotle's catharsis, and Longinus's concept of \"transport\" to late-nineteenth century belles-lettres and the contemporary Chicago Critics. For Wimsatt, the fallacy led to a number of potential errors, most of them related to emotional relativism. A view of literature based on its putative emotional effects will always be vulnerable to mystification and subjectivity; Wimsatt singles out the belletristic tradition exemplified by critics such as Arthur Quiller-Couch and George Saintsbury as an instance of a type of criticism that relies on subjective impressions and is thus unrepeatable and unreliable.\n\nFor Wimsatt, as for all the New Critics, such impressionistic approaches pose both practical and theoretical problems. In practical terms, it makes reliable comparisons of different critics difficult, if not irrelevant. In this light, the affective fallacy ran afoul of the New Critics' desire to place literary criticism on a more objective and principled basis. On the theoretical plane, the critical approach denoted as affective fallacy was fundamentally unsound because it denied the iconicity of the literary text. New Critical theorists stressed the unique nature of poetic language, and they asserted that—in view of this uniqueness—the role of the critic is to study and elucidate the thematic and stylistic \"language\" of each text on its own terms, without primary reference to an outside context, whether of history, biography, or reader-response.\n\nIn practice, Wimsatt and the other New Critics were less stringent in their application of the theory than in their theoretical pronouncements. Wimsatt admitted the appropriateness of commenting on emotional effects as an entry into a text, as long as those effects were not made the focus of analysis.\n\nAs with many concepts of New Criticism, the concept of the affective fallacy was both controversial and, though widely influential, never accepted wholly by any great number of critics.\n\nThe first critiques of the concept came, naturally enough, from those academic schools against whom the New Critics were ranged in the 1940s and 1950s, principally the historical scholars and the remaining belletristic critics. Early commentary deplored the use of the word \"fallacy\" itself, which seemed to many critics unduly combative. More sympathetic critics, while still objecting to Wimsatt's tone, accepted as valuable and necessary his attempt to place criticism on a more objective basis.\n\nHowever, the extremism of Wimsatt's approach was ultimately judged untenable by a number of critics. Just as New Historicism repudiated the New Critics' rejection of historical context, so reader-response criticism arose partly from dissatisfaction with the concept of the text as icon. Reader-response critics denied that a text could have a quantifiable significance outside its being read and experienced by particular readers at particular moments. These critics rejected the idea of text as icon, focusing instead on the ramifications of the interaction between text and reader.\n\nWhile the term remains current as a warning against unsophisticated use of emotional response in analyzing texts, the theory underlying the term has been thoroughly eclipsed by more recent developments in criticism.\n\n\"The Affective Fallacy is a confusion between the poem and its results (what it is and what it does), a special case of epistemological skepticism [ ... which ...] begins by trying to derive the standard of criticism from the psychological effects of the poem and ends in impressionism and relativism [with the result that] the poem itself, as an object of specifically critical judgment, tends to disappear.\"\n\n\"The report of some readers ... that a poem or story induces in them vivid images, intense feelings, or heightened consciousness, is neither anything which can be refuted nor anything which it is possible for the objective critic to take into account.\"\n\nWimsatt and Beardsley on an ideal, objective criticism: \"It will not talk of tears, prickles or other physiological symptoms, of feeling angry, joyful, hot, cold, or intense, or of vaguer states of emotional disturbance, but of shades of distinction and relation between objects of emotion.\"\n\n\"The critic is not a contributor to statistical countable reports about the poem, but a teacher or explicator of meanings. His readers, if they are alert, will not be content to take what he says as testimony, but will scrutinize it as teaching.\"\n\n"}

However, in 2003 a British court ruled that the charges against Raissi were without evidence, and that he had no association with the attacks. In April 2010 it was announced that he was eligible for compensation, the amount of which was as yet undecided.\n\nRaissi was born and grew up in Bab el Oued, a suburb of Algiers. In November 1996 he moved to Phoenix, Arizona, USA, to attend flight school, including a 1998 stint at Sawyer School of Aviation a month after Hani Hanjour quit.\n\nIn April 2000, when his student visa expired, he moved back to Algeria and then to London, with his wife Sonia (née Demolis), whom he had met in the United States.\n\nFrom June 11–18, 2001, Raissi had apparently visited Las Vegas, while Ziad Jarrah was in the city.\nOn his way home from the city, he was given a citation for speeding in Arizona.\n\nRaissi was living outside Colnbrook (near Heathrow) at the time of the attacks. He was arrested at 3 am on September 21, 2001, when he was taken from his house naked, along with his wife Sonia and his brother.\n\"The Times\" obtained a copy of the FBI's initial request for information about Raissi. In it, \"The Times\" asserts, the FBI requested that British authorities use discretion, in order not to tip him off that he was under suspicion.\n\nRaissi's brother and wife Sonia were released by British police four days after the arrests, although Sonia lost her job working with Air France and his brother's wife lost her job at Heathrow Airport as well.\nFrom there Raissi was detained for five months at Belmarsh Prison, under suspicion of training the pilots who flew the jet into the Pentagon. He was also charged with using a \"false identity\" having gone by the name \"Fabrice Vincent Algier\", and for conspiring to help Redouane Dahmani lie on his visa application.\n\nAfter a week of interrogation US officials, and British prosecutor James Lewis, made an extradition request; ironically, due to a lack of evidence that he was involved in the September 11 attacks, the only charge he could be held on was lying on his pilot's licence application by not revealing he had undergone knee surgery after a tennis injury, and a charge for shoplifting at a London airport dating to 1993. Raissi's attorney was Richard Egan\n\nBritish prosecutor Arvinder Sambei (who became a director of Amicus Legal Consultants, which is now Sambei, Bridger & Polaine) publicly announced that the FBI had discovered Raissi's name in Salem al-Hazmi's rental vehicle; that a raid on Raissi's home had turned up video evidence of him and Hani Hanjour celebrating together on his computer; that further telephone records confirmed their suspicions that he had trained four of the hijackers in an effort to help support terrorism against U.S. interests, that his pilot logbook was missing all data from March 2000 to June 2001, and stated that they might seek the death penalty.\nHowever once his trial began, they were unable to produce any such evidence. According to \"The Times\";\n\nOn February 12, 2002, Judge Timothy Workman allowed Raissi to post £10,000 bail and surrender his passport, after stating that there seemed to be no credibility to the US claims.\nHe was formally released from charges on April 21.\n\nIn September 2003, Raissi announced he was suing the FBI and the Department of Justice for $10 million over claims that his life had been ruined by his being branded a terrorist and that he was unable to find work.\n\nThe suit, carried by Richard Egan and Jules Carey of Tuckers Solicitors, alleges false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, malicious continuation of prosecution, abuse of process, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence in infliction of emotional distress. Amnesty International's Paul Hoffman was one of the lawyers handling the case.\n\nRaissi launched a civil suit against the \"Mail on Sunday\" for printing false information about criminal charges he faced, and citing the fact that airlines will not hire him because of the accusations against him. He was awarded an undisclosed sum.\n\nOn February 22, 2007, Mr Raissi lost his case in the UK High Court to claim compensation for wrongful arrest and the 5 months he spent in Belmarsh. Judges ruled him ineligible on the grounds that he had been held as part of an extradition case rather than 'in the domestic criminal process'. He took his case to the Court of Appeal and the High Court ruling was overturned, Appeal Judges stating that evidence showed the CPS and the Police were responsible for \"serious defaults\".\n\nRaissi's case remains a contentious issue in Algeria, whose government refuses to sign an agreement with Britain about extraditing hijackers until Britain acknowledges that its treatment of Raissi was flawed. British authorities continue to insist that British police and prosecutors acted properly, and it was American authorities who were at fault for supplying them with bad intelligence.\n\nIn February 2008 the Court of Appeal rejected this position, 'completely exonerated' Raissi, and ordered British authorities to reconsider his entitlement to compensation, which had previously been rejected. It also found that the Crown Prosecution Service and the police had presented false evidence to the courts.\n\nHis application for permission to enforce the order of the Court of Appeal, and contempt of court proceedings against the Home Office, resulted in an announcement on 23 April 2010 by the Secretary of State for Justice Jack Straw that Raissi is eligible for up to £2m compensation.\n\n"}

{"id": "1921467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921467", "title": "Backpacker murders", "text": "Backpacker murders\n\nThe backpacker murders were a spate of serial killings that took place in New South Wales, Australia, between 1989 and 1993, committed by Ivan Milat. The bodies of seven missing young people aged 19 to 22 were discovered partially buried in the Belanglo State Forest, south-west of the New South Wales town of Berrima. Five of the victims were foreign backpackers (three German, two British) and two were Australian travellers from Melbourne. Milat was convicted of the murders on 27 July 1996 and was sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences, as well as 18 years without parole. He died in prison on 27 October 2019, having never confessed to the murders for which he was convicted.\n\nUp until the mid-1990s, hitchhiking in Australia was viewed as an adventurous and inexpensive, if not completely safe, means of travel. Encouraged in the 1980s by successful tourism campaigns such as \"Shrimp on the barbie\" and articles in travel publications such as \"Lonely Planet\", backpackers on limited budgets sought ways to travel cheaply, such as purchasing used cars or using buses. However, unsolved Australian missing-person cases such as that of Trudie Adams (1978), Tony Jones (1982), Naoko Onda (1987) and Anna Rosa Liva (1991) led to those who still hitchhiked to begin to travel in pairs for safety.\n\nBy the time of the first Belanglo State Forest discoveries, several other backpackers had also disappeared. One case involved a young Victorian couple from Frankston, Deborah Everist (19) and James Gibson (19), who had been missing since leaving Sydney for ConFest, near Albury, on 30 December 1989. Another related to Simone Schmidl (21), from Germany, who had been missing since leaving Sydney for Melbourne on 20 January 1991. Similarly, a German couple, Gabor Neugebauer (21) and Anja Habschied (20), had disappeared after leaving a Kings Cross hostel for Mildura on 26 December 1991. Another involved missing British backpackers Caroline Clarke (21) and Joanne Walters (22), who were last seen in Kings Cross on 18 April 1992.\n\nOn 19 September 1992, two runners discovered a concealed corpse while orienteering in Belanglo. The following morning, police discovered a second body from the first. Police quickly confirmed, via dental records, that the bodies were those of Clarke and Walters. Walters had been stabbed 14 times; four times in the chest, once in the neck, and nine times in the back which would have paralysed her. Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head at the burial site, and police believe she had been used as target practice. After a thorough search of the forest, investigators ruled out the possibility of further discoveries within Belanglo State Forest.\n\nIn October 1993, a local man searching for firewood discovered bones in a particularly remote section of the forest. He returned with police to the scene where two bodies were quickly discovered and later identified as Gibson and Everist. Gibson's skeleton, found in a foetal position, showed eight stab wounds. A large knife had cut through his upper spine causing paralysis, and stab wounds to his back and chest would have punctured his heart and lungs. Everist had been savagely beaten; her skull was fractured in two places, her jaw was broken and there were knife marks on her forehead. She had been stabbed once in the back. The presence of Gibson's body in Belanglo puzzled investigators as his camera had previously been discovered on 31 December 1989, and his backpack later on 13 March 1990, by the side of the road at Galston Gorge, in the northern Sydney suburbs, over to the north.\n\nOn 1 November 1993, a skeleton was found in a clearing along a fire trail in the forest during a police sweep. It was later identified as that of Schmidl, and bore at least eight stab wounds: two had severed her spine and others would have punctured her heart and lungs. Clothing found at the scene was not Schmidl's, but matched that of another missing backpacker, Habschied. The bodies of Habschied and Neugebauer were then found on a nearby fire trail, on 4 November 1993, in shallow graves apart. Habschied had been decapitated, and despite an extensive search, her skull was never found. Neugebauer had been shot in the head six times.\n\nThere was evidence that some of the victims did not die instantly from their injuries.\n\nIn response to the finds, on 14 October 1993, Task Force Air, containing more than 20 detectives and analysts, was set up by the NSW Police. On 5 November 1993, the NSW government increased the reward in relation to the Belanglo serial killings to $500,000. Public warnings were also given, particularly aimed at international backpackers, to avoid hitchhiking along the Hume Highway. After developing their profile of the killer, the police faced an enormous volume of data from numerous sources. Investigators applied link analysis technology to Roads and Traffic Authority vehicle records, gym memberships, gun licensing, and internal police records. As a result, the list of suspects was progressively narrowed to a short list of 230, then to an even shorter list of 32.\n\nThere were similar aspects to all the murders. Each of the bodies had been dumped in remote bush-land and covered by a pyramid of sticks and ferns. Forensic study determined that each had suffered multiple stab wounds to the torso, and many showed signs of sexual assault. The killer, probably a local with a 4WD, had evidently restrained and spent considerable time with the victims both during and after the murders, as campsites were discovered close to the location of each body. Matching .22 bullets, shell casings, and cartridge boxes from two weapons also linked the crime scenes. Speculation arose that the crimes were the work of several killers, given that most of the victims had been attacked while as pairs, had been killed in different ways, and buried separately.\n\nOn 13 November 1993, police received a call from Paul Onions (24) in the U.K. On 25 January 1990, Onions had been backpacking in Australia and, while hitchhiking from Liverpool station towards Mildura, had accepted a ride south out of Casula from a man known only as \"Bill\". South of the town of Mittagong, and less than 1 km from Belanglo State Forest, Bill stopped and pulled out a revolver and some ropes stating it was a robbery, at which point Onions managed to flee while Bill pursued and shot at him. Onions flagged down Joanne Berry, a passing motorist, and together they sped off and described the assailant and his vehicle to the Bowral police. On 13 April 1994, detectives re-found the note regarding Onions' call and sought the original report from Bowral police, but it was missing. Fortunately, a constable had recorded details in her notebook. Onions' statement was corroborated by Berry, who had also contacted the investigation team, along with the girlfriend of a man who worked with Ivan Milat, who thought he should be questioned over the case.\n\nOn 26 February 1994, police surveillance of the Milat house at Cinnabar Street, Eagle Vale commenced. Police learnt that Milat had recently sold his silver Nissan Patrol four-wheel drive shortly after the discovery of the bodies of Clarke and Walters. Police also confirmed that Milat had not been working on any of the days of the attacks and acquaintances also told police about Milat's obsession with weapons. Milat's brother, Bill, who often had his identity used by his brother for work or vehicle registrations, was questioned by investigators. When the connection between the Belanglo murders and Onions' experience was made, Onions flew to Australia to help with the investigation. On 5 May 1994, Onions positively identified Milat as the man who had picked him up and attempted to assault him.\n\nMilat was arrested at his home on 22 May 1994 on robbery and weapon charges related to the Onions attack after 50 police officers surrounded the premises, including heavily armed officers from the Tactical Operations Unit. The search of Milat's home revealed various weapons, including a .22-calibre Anschütz Model 1441/42 rifle and parts of a .22 calibre Ruger 10/22 rifle that matched the type used in the murders, a Browning pistol, and a Bowie knife. Also uncovered was foreign currency, clothing, a tent, sleeping bags, camping equipment and cameras belonging to several of his victims. Homes belonging to his mother and five of his brothers were also searched at the same time by over 300 police, uncovering a total of 24 weapons, 250 kg of ammunition, and several more items belonging to the victims.\n\nMilat appeared in court on 23 May, but he did not enter a plea. On 31 May, Milat was also charged with the seven backpacker murders. On 28 June, Milat sacked his defence lawyer, Marsden, and sought legal aid to pay for his defence. Meanwhile, brothers Richard and Walter were tried in relation to weapons, drugs and stolen items found on their properties. A committal hearing for Milat regarding the murders began on 24 October and lasted until 12 December, during which over 200 witnesses appeared. Based on the evidence, at the beginning of February 1995, Milat was remanded in custody until June that same year.\n\nOn 26 March 1996, the trial opened at the NSW Supreme Court and was prosecuted by Mark Tedeschi. His defence argued that, in spite of the evidence, there was no non-circumstantial proof Milat was guilty and attempted to shift the blame to other members of his family, particularly Richard. 145 witnesses took the stand, including members of the Milat family who endeavoured to provide alibis, and, on 18 June, Milat himself. On 27 July 1996, after 18 weeks of testimony, a jury found Milat guilty of the murders. He was given a life sentence on each count without the possibility of parole. He was also convicted of the attempted murder, false imprisonment and robbery of Onions, for which he received six years' jail each.\n\nPolice maintain that Milat could have been involved in more attacks or murders than the seven for which he was convicted. Based on MO similarities, examples include Keren Rowland (20, disappeared 26 February 1971, found in the Fairbairn Pine Plantation in May 1971), Peter Letcher (18, missing November 1987, found in the Jenolan State Forest in 1988), and Dianne Pennacchio (29, disappeared 6 September 1991, found in the Tallaganda State Forest in November 1991). Further, given the possibility of an accomplice, the murder cases were kept open. On 18 July 2005, Milat's former lawyer, Marsden, made a deathbed statement in which he claimed that Milat had been assisted by his sister, Shirley Soire (1946–2003), in the killings of the two British backpackers.\n\nIn 2001, Milat was ordered to give evidence at an inquest into the disappearances in the Newcastle area of three other female backpackers (Leanne Goodall, 20, disappeared 30 December 1978; Robyn Hickie, 18, disappeared 7 April 1979; Amanda Robinson, 14, disappeared 21 April 1979). A related cold case is that of Gordana Kotevski (16) who disappeared in 1994. Although Milat was working in the area at the time of the crimes, no case has been brought against him due to a lack of evidence. Similar inquiries were launched in 2003, in relation to the disappearance of two nurses and again in 2005, relating to the disappearance of hitchhiker Annette Briffa, but no charges were laid.\n\nIn 2010, in a media interview, Onions described how he accepted, but did not use, a $200,000 reward granted for his part in the conviction of Milat.\n\nOn 8 November 2004, Milat gave a televised interview on \"Australian Story\", in which he denied that any of his family had been implicated in the seven murders. The 2005 Australian film \"Wolf Creek\" is based on the backpacker murders of two British females. A sequel, \"Wolf Creek 2\", based on backpacker murders of two Germans, was released in 2013. In March 2017, the case was covered by \"Felon True Crime\", and in March 2019, \"Casefile True Crime Podcast\" began airing a five-part series on the Belanglo crimes.\n\n"}

{"id": "1921474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921474", "title": "Erling Dekke Næss", "text": "Erling Dekke Næss\n\nErling Dekke Næss (5 September 1901 – 7 February 1993) was a Norwegian shipowner and businessman. Brother of philosopher Arne Dekke Næss, his nephew was the mountaineer and businessman Arne Næss Jr. Best known for his early adoption of flags of convenience, Næss was Deputy Head of Nortraship's New York office from 1942 to 1946. Næss was the initiator behind the OBO carrier. He is also credited as proposing the very successful Norwegian International Ship Register, which allowed Norwegian shipowners to compete on an equal footing with flags of convenience.\n\nErling Dekke Næss was born in Bergen, Norway and was son of Ragnar Næss, a businessman and banker. He had two brothers, the younger being the well-known philosopher Arne Næss. The family moved to Kristiania in 1911 were his father died in 1913. The family seems to have been well off, although in no way affluent. Næss studied economy at the Royal Frederick University and earned a B.S. in 1920, achieved mostly by studying on his own. He contemplated continued studies and travelled to Britain to finish a Ph.D. at the London School of Economics.\n\nNæss however did not have the financial resources to study, so he had to work; after a short stint at Midland Bank he changed over to C. J. Hambro & Son. He started out as a typist, writing letters to Scandinavian customers, but after a year he was made assistant in the new currency department. In the evenings he continued his studies in economics, and was greatly influenced by John Maynard Keynes. Of special interest for his research and work were the imbalances created by the German war reparations, as their consequences could be seen clearly in the currency market with the German mark rapidly losing value against other main currencies. The young Næss was amazed at being in the center of the disastrous decline of the mark, severely undermining the Weimar Republic. By the middle of 1923 Næss decided to concentrate on his Ph.D. and thus ended his engagement with the bank.\n\nThe aim of his research was to show how fluctuations in the currency market influenced each nation's prices, and he became a member of the Royal Economic Society in order to follow lectures by Keynes and others. Keynes was an eager proponent of economists investing in the market, in order to \"live as one learned\", and young Næss followed this. He started out with small investments in rubber, as there were huge imbalances in supply and demand which he had found through his research. With the profits he continued into tin, and as he was successful he was offered a job as an analyst by his broker, so leaving him with less time for concluding his research.\n\nIn 1927 Næss got to know Rupert Trouton, and he presented Næss with a plan to buy control of his father-in-law's whaling enterprise, the Norwegian company \"A/S Hektor\". In establishing the \"Hektor Whaling Ltd\" Næss got good use for his banking experience and contacts in City. Næss himself took £50,000 of the company's total capital of £600,000, a gamble that was to make him a huge profit. Due to his success in this enterprise he was in the summer of 1928 contacted by the Norwegian whaling pioneers Torger Moe and Johan Rasmussen, asking his help to arrange financing of their \"Viking Whaling Company Ltd\", as they planned to build one of the world's first whale factory ship. The vessel \"Vikingen\" was to be built as a tanker, with the whale processing factory on its deck; thus being able to trade both as a factory ship and a tanker.\n\nNæss found the prospect very interesting, arranged the financing and the first whaling company trading on the LSE started in January 1929. Næss did receive some critique from Norway for \"selling out know-how\" to the British, as whaling was a huge Norwegian industry. Næss' view was that the capital was difficult to obtain in Norway; moreover that the crew and supplies anyway would come from Norway. \"Vikingen\", with a deadweight tons of 15,000 tons was delivered in September 1929 and sailed for its first season, which was a huge success.\n\nThere were however problems: as \"Vikingen\" was British registered, Norwegian stockowners were taxed twice. In order to remedy this, Næss found the innovative solution of moving the administration to France and registering the vessel \"Vikingen\" in Panama, as US-owned vessels had done since 1922. Næss had to overcome a number of obstacles, one of them arranging a tax agreement between the US and Panama. In concluding this agreement Næss got assistance from Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. After much research and work a Panama company named Viking Corporation was established and the \"Vikingen\" with its whaling vessels was sold to that company in 1931. The various Norwegian sailors' organisations were informed that all wages and agreements would remain as before, and a bonus would be given covering the fact that the seamen would not receive Norwegian public pensions. This was accepted by the powerful head of the seamen's union, Mr. Ingvald Haugen.\n\nThe purpose of the \"Viking Whaling Company Ltd\" was not only to operate its own whale factory ships but to buy shares in Norwegian companies. It bought shares in A/S Vestfold, A/S Sydhavet and A/S Rosshavet, all controlled by Johan Rasmussen & Co. Besides ships these companies had a whaling station on South Shetland. The profits were impressive; for the years 1924 - 1928 above 60%, with a maximum of 147% as net profit to capital. With the depression the prices collapsed, and in the beginning of the 1930s there were a number of vessels laid up and restructuring in the business. Næss was closely involved in this, especially the sale of the huge new whale factory ship \"Vestfold\" () to a newly established company in London, as A/S Vestfold could not service its debtors. This was made possible by Næss's good connections in London, and saved the Norwegian company from bankruptcy.\n\nDuring the years 1932-34 the prices on whale oil sank from £25 to £10 per ton. To counter this the first voluntary reductions of production came forth, as governed by a quota agreement signed 9 June 1932. The agreement set limits on production of whale oil and the length of the season, it was to start 7 October 1932 and end 30 April 1933. This resulted in that the companies Næss was involved with used only the modern \"Vestfold\" for that season.\n\nIn December 1934 Næss travelled to Cape Town in order to study the whale hunt, and reached the \"Vestfold\" in January 1935. He saw the whole process of hunting and processing the whales. He was trying his luck at shooting whales and was very much impressed by the gunners' skill. The largest whale caught was some 33 m with a weight of over 100 tonnes. Næss seemed to regret part of his involvement in the whaling business, as it ended almost exterminating the large whales. Næss was back in London in March 1935, and though the market was still down it had improved, due to large purchases of whale oil by the German government. In the season 1937 - 1938 the market was down again, and with \"Vestfold\" producing a loss it was decided to sell \"Vikingen\".\n\nThe only buyer was the German government, and it could only pay with building a tanker. It was a huge political gamble, but the agreement was signed in Berlin early 1938 and the building of the tanker started at Deutsche Werft in Hamburg. Næss was acutely aware of war looming and followed the building himself. The vessel named \"Norness\" and delivered on 4 May 1939. The remaining whale factory vessel in the cooperating companies was now \"Vestfold\"; it would do its last season 1939 - 1940. After delivering some of its cargo to Procter & Gamble in New York and the rest in Liverpool it would act as a bunker vessel in Freetown until 1944, when it departed and was sunk by a German submarine.\n\nThe whale factory vessels were actually tankers with the whale processing equipment added, so it was natural for Næss and his partners to venture into tankers. The first small step was in 1930 with two motor tankers, \"Nore\", a vessel and \"Norvinn\" , both considered large by then current standards. The vessels were to have traded in the spot market, but as the rates were low both were laid up. Næss was not discouraged by this and on 20 February 1936 established the company \"Viking Tanker Company Limited\" with capital raised in London. The administration was in Paris and the vessels were to sail under the Panama flag. It bought the two previous mentioned tankers from Rasmussen & Moe's Rederi A/S, and as the tanker market was good it ordered and bought several vessels. By 1938 the company had 5 vessels, \"Nore\", \"Norvinn\", \"Norvik\", \"Norlys\" and \"Norbris\", totalling - a large tanker fleet for that period. The financial results were good with a net profit of £192,575 for the company's second year of operation.\n\nIn September 1939 World War II began, and the tanker markets became very strong. Even though sailing under a neutral flag the \"Viking Tanker Company\" vessels were able to trade as they followed British regulations. Næss travelled to Norway in April 1940, as he had been requested by the British Ministry of Trade to contact Norwegian shipowners that did not fully support the blockade of Germany. He would also meet his colleagues in Sandefjord, Johan Rasmussen and Torger Moe. Næss managed to have a meeting on 8 April 1940 with the Norwegian Foreign Minister, Halvdan Koht and woke up the day after, 9 April with the German invasion of Oslo, seeing the German transport planes landing at the Fornebu airport from his brother Arne Næss's house in Holmenkollen. Næss was pessimistic about Norway's chances towards the German invasion and escaped Oslo on 10 April, heading westwards by air. The journey would be by train, air, car and small boats and he finally ended up in Ålesund where he volunteered as an interpreter for the British Expeditionary Force. On the way he was twice locked up by Norwegian police, suspecting him of being a spy. After a few weeks in Ålesund the British forces had to withdraw and Næss followed them back to Britain.\n\nBack in London Næss had to establish contact with the seven vessels operated by the group; until the invasion they had been controlled by the office in Sandefjord, Norway. These were the whale factory ship \"Vestfold\" (built in Framnæs shipyard), the tankers \"Norness\", \"Norbris\", \"Norlys\", \"Norvinn\" and finally the dry cargo vessels \"Nordal\" and \"Nortun\". The British government also wanted control of his fleet, demanding to have the vessels on bare-boat charter. This was a major blow to Næss, he felt insulted by what he viewed as unfriendly treatment of a friend of Britain. Næss insisted on running the company himself; knowing both the vessels and the crew he felt he would be the most competent person for that. The British government initially did not accept this; weeks followed where Næss virtually was a hostage, not allowed to contact his vessels or leave the country. The solution came through the banker Sam Guinness, as the companies had substantial amounts of US dollars in New York banks. This money could only be released by Næss, and the British government needed dollars. So for $1,125,000 Næss got his travel permit to the US.\n\nIn August 1940 Næs arrived in New York on the White Star/Cunard liner \"Scythia\", and he immediately proceeded to secure premises in State Street for his company office. The British government was however still insistent on controlling the vessels, and their weapon was the bunkering permit needed for British-controlled harbours. As Næss thought he was the most capable person to control the fleet he took his case to the United States Maritime Commission. After a 10-minute meeting with its leader, Admiral Emory S. Land, in September 1940 he was instructed that two of his vessels should be chartered to the British and five to the US. Thus Næss, as one of the few, if not the only, private shipowners allowed to continue his operations during the war. As the trade was good this was indeed a boon, but also a challenge. The other countries controlled their vessels' crews, while Næss with his Panama flag had to recruit his seamen on a voluntary basis. Overall the business went well, and Næss established a good working relationship with the \"United States Maritime Commission\". For the accounting year ending 31 July 1940 the net profit was £150,325, for 1941 it was £155,844, and for 1942 £158,397.\n\nThe first vessel the company lost was \"Norness\", torpedoed off Long Island in January 1942. It was the first vessel to be sunk that close to the US coast. The sinking was huge news and the press coverage was extensive, even though the whole crew was saved.\n\nSome time during the summer of 1942 Næss was called for a meeting with Johan Ludwig Mowinckel, former prime minister of Norway. He was not satisfied with how Nortraship was administered and wanted Næss into the management of the organisation, as he had good connections with the \"United States Maritime Commission\". In November 1942 Næss was given the position as Deputy Head of the Nortraship New York office. For Næss it was a sacrifice as he had to give up his job as head of the \"Viking Tanker Company\" and sell his shares, in order not to have conflicts of interest.\n\nImmediately after joining \"Nortraship\" Næss was thrown into negotiating a new tonnage agreement with his British and US counterparts, Bill Weston from the Ministry of War Transport and David Scoll from the War Shipping Administration. The negotiations took months and were hard bargaining. The agreement signed on New Year's Eve 1942 and thus named the Hogmanay agreement. The agreement was to last for the rest of the war and Næss played the inexperienced US negotiator against the British, thus landing as many benefits as he could for the Norwegians.\n\nWith the tonnage agreement settled Næss focused on the bad relationship between the main \"Nortraship\" offices, London and New York. He initiated an exchange of reports between the offices, and made a number of visits to the London office, thus gradually improving the cooperation between them. When the war ended in 1945 Næss was asked to stay on to help liquidate Nortraship and to arrange the negotiations for new vessels replacing the ones sunk during the war. Næss stayed for another year and, together with Nortraship's representative in Washington, George O. Mejlænder, a number of vessels were secured for Norwegian owners. Næss later regretted the decision to stay on as his rivals Onassis and Niarchos got a head start on him.\n\nIn November 1946 after leaving Nortraship Næss established the company \"Næss, Mejlænder & Co. Inc.\" in New York with a capital of $50,000. They quickly set up two companies in Panama, \"Nortuna Shipping Company Inc.\" and \"Norness Shipping Company Inc.\" Næss managed to secure financing from J. P. Morgan & Co. which became a pillar in the group's growth. \"Nortuna\" bought four old US general cargo ships, and two liners were ordered from \"Mitsubishi Shipbuilding & Engineering\" in Tokyo, to be built by their dock in Yokohama. Næss made his first visit to Japan in 1949 when the country was still occupied by US forces, and the orders were the first from a foreigner after the war. In the years to come Japanese shipyards were to deliver around 30 vessels to the Næss group. The vessels were named \"Sagura\" and \"Yama\", the latter sold just after delivery as the market was bad. That was a huge mistake as the war in Korea broke out and the demand for vessels soared.\n\nAfter selling the four old vessels Næss liquidated \"Nortuna Shipping\" and concentrated on \"Norness Shipping\", and after a dull start he started using \"Contracts of Affreightment\" in a 1954 agreement with \"American Independent Oil Company\", of San Francisco. The contract stipulated that a given amount of oil was to be transported to Houston, Texas from the Persian Gulf. The form of the contract gave Næss room to arrange the best possible conditions for transporting the oil, both for him and the oil company. The terms of the contract created a small sensation and Næss was summoned for a lunch in the Petroleum Club of Houston.\n\nAfter the Korea war the market dived, but as an economist Næss was sure the market would rise again. If one took a longer view, say 15 years, the fluctuations would level out and ships on long-time charter would be profitable. To realize this idea Næss organised the \"Naess Scheme Charters\", where he would take other shipowners' vessels on long-term charters. The spirit behind this was pooling resources; each would do what one did best. The shipowners supplying tonnage would build, finance and manage, while Næss as the charterer would do his utmost to place the vessels. From 1954 ten vessels were chartered by \"Scandinavian American Shipping Company\" (owned 57% by \"Norness Shipping\" and 43% by the Rockefeller family) on \"Naess Scheme Charters\", from reputed Scandinavian shipping companies, among them A. P. Møller. Næss's theory seemed to hold; although for some years the charters ran with losses, the shipping boom after 1967 ended the 15-year charters with a solid profit.\n\nThe year 1956 was to be the start of strong growth for the Næss business as he started to order vessels he anticipated the oil companies would need in the coming years. The basis was long-term financing from banks and insurance companies in the US and other countries; this made it fairly easy to arrange short-time financing for building vessels. He ordered four big tankers from Japanese builders; each was around , to be delivered from September 1957 to June 1958. It was a gamble, but it paid off; within a few months all four were on long-term charter, two to Socal and two to Texaco. By April 1957 Næss had ordered 20 new buildings, to be delivered over the following five years. Except for three of the vessels, they were covered by long-time charters. Seven of the vessels were to be built by Japanese shipyards, due to their high quality and prompt delivery. George Mejlænder decided to start his own brokerage firm and Næss paid him out; the company name was changed to \"Næss Shipping Co. Inc.\" As the \"battle of convenience flags\" heated up Næss decided to secure his position and on the 15 November 1958 he established \"Anglo American Shipping Co. Ltd\" on Bermuda; thus the vessels could fly the British flag.\n\nIn 1958 the battle of convenience flags heated up and a boycott of ships sailing under such flags was declared by the ITF. Næss was having problems with insurance for his vessels and from a number of accusations of him being a \"pirate\". He was the chairman of the \"American Committee for Flags of Necessity\" and as such a highly visible target. As mentioned above he countered by registering vessels on Bermuda; the island required no taxes, the only inconvenience being that he had to employ a British captain, chief engineer and radio officer. Another benefit from using Bermuda was that quite a few charters were settled in British pounds; using the British flag removed the currency risk.\n\nNæss also counter-charged by attending a conference with major British newspapers on 10 July 1958, where he stressed his view that flags of convenience did not need to be substandard. If the ITF encountered substandard vessels he and any sane shipowner would support a boycott of them, Næss argued. Ships with crews paid according to standards, and with a technical standard on a line with what international regulations required, should however not be targeted.\n\nIn the 1950s Næss had offices in Nassau, Bahamas, but as he was not satisfied with the political conditions he started searching for other options. He surveyed Panama City but found the city to be too far from New York, and it would be difficult to recruit good management there. He was advised to have a look at Bermuda and found it favourable, so he moved his offices there.\n\n\"Anglo American Shipping Co. Ltd\" was introduced on the London Stock Exchange in November 1959, the majority of the shares owned by \"Norness Shipping\", the remainder owned by British investors and Næss's friends within New York finance. Five vessels were ordered for the company, the largest being the \"Naess Sovereign\" and \"Naess Champion\"; both were around and built by Mitsubishi in Nagasaki, Japan. When delivered in January 1961 \"Naess Sovereign\" was the third largest tanker in the world, and the largest under the British flag. To manage the vessels Næss linked up with a company in Glasgow, establishing the firm \"Næss Denholm & Co. Ltd\". For the shipping industry at large 1960 was a difficult year, with old tonnage laid up; \"Anglo American\" with its new vessels and long-time charters was an exception.\n\nCreating \"Anglo American\" and the transfer of a number of vessels on time-charter to that company partly changed \"Norness Shipping\" to an investment company, as it held 68.5% of \"Anglo American's\" shares. As the years 1959 - 1961 were bad in the tanker market Næss placed his attention on developing large bulk carriers and arranging \"affreightment\" contracts for them. The focus on \"Norness Shipping\" created anxiety among \"Anglo American\" shareholders as to whether enough was being done to expand that company. This created the basis for a merger between the two companies, but that was complicated as there were serious problems connected to taxation of shareholders. The tax problem for the US \"Norness Shipping\" shareholders was solved in February 1962 and the merger talks could start in detail. The final agreement was signed on 15 December 1962; the value of Næss's original $50,000 was now $44,000,000 and the new company was named \"Anglo Norness Shipping Company Ltd.\".\n\nIn 1962 Næss learned that the P&O had ordered four bulk carriers, each of around . Næss knew that this was a new area for P&O and arranged a meeting with the chairman, Sir Donald F. Anderson, whom he knew well from his Nortraship days. Næss proposed that the two companies should cooperate and pool their vessels into one joint owned company. P&O found the idea attractive and \"Associated Bulk Carriers Ltd.\" was established on 8 April 1964. The joint company was a huge success and by 1970 \"ABC\" contained 36 vessels with a total of . Part of the success was that Næss was able to persuade the more conservative P&O to order a number of OBO carriers, thus adding flexibility to the concept.\n\nNæss was always searching for increased efficiency, and the long voyages ballasted for tankers posed an intriguing problem. In the mid of the 1950s he started to think about a combination ship that could carry both oil and bulk cargoes. Oil and ore ships had been in operation since the 1920s, but a vessel with the capability of carrying both oil and bulk cargoes seemed impossible to construct. Næss pushed his chief naval architect T. M. Karlsen to keep researching the combined vessel, also checking in on various failed projects like the \"Mando Theodoracopulos\". One of the deficiencies of that vessel was the small hatches, too small for efficient discharging.\n\nIn 1964 the Naess group started a collaboration with P&O in the form of the jointly owned company Associated Bulk Carriers, thus giving them access to P&O's vast technical department. The last hurdles were cleared under a meeting at the A. G. Weser shipyard in Bremen on 6 April 1964, and a contract for building the first combined vessel was signed. The vessel was christened 16 June 1965 as Naess Norseman. The German industrialist owning the shipyard proposed the type to be called \"Naess-type\"; Næss himself however found it more appropriate to name it after the cargoes carried. Thus the name for the new type was to be OBO for Oil-Bulk-Ore. The vessel performed as expected, with some 75% of the time with cargo and only 25% in ballast. The much increased time with cargo would then more than outweigh the 15% higher cost of the vessel. Adding to the versatility of the type was that the oil and bulk market often developed differently. The OBO ship could then trade with bulk cargoes when that market was on top, and change to oil when the demand for tanker tonnage was high.\n\nAfter the boom from mid 1956 to mid 1957 the shipping markets were depressed for years to come. In spite of this the \"Anglo Norness Shipping Company\" had impressive results:\n\nThe cooperation with \"P&O\" in bulk carriers had started through \"Associated Bulk Carriers Ltd.\", and the battle of flags of convenience had been won. In twelve years the \"Anglo Norness\" fleet had expanded into one of the largest in the world, with 58 vessels totalling including new buildings and charters. The three years from 1964 were meagre for the Næss group.\n\nThe market continued to be depressed, and the group had losses on the chartered vessels. Næss was put under considerable pressure to abandon his policy of operating in the spot market but he strongly resisted long time charters as he believed the markets would recover. Then, in June 1967 the Six-Day War erupted, and the Suez Canal closed for years to come. This created an enormous surge in demand for tanker tonnage and the Næss group was ideally positioned with 16 large tankers available, receiving extremely good rates for its vessels.\n\nWith a strong financial situation Næss started thinking about the group's long-term strategy; the world economy was volatile, and there were inflationary pressure and currency problems. The company was courted by \"Occidental Petroleum Company\" and \"Zapata Offshore Company\" (founded in 1953 by George H. W. Bush), and the latter won the merger with an offer of $5 per share, valuing the company at $47.5 million. As a diversified offshore company Zapata seemed to be well positioned to take advantage of the expected boom in oil exploration and its offer was accepted in May 1968, and the company name changed to \"Zapata Norness Inc.\".\n\nNæss started as a member of the board of the new company and initiated a huge expansion program, ordering a number of ship with a total costing $163 million. As Zapata had its offices in Houston it became tedious for Næss to attend board meetings; he withdrew and his son Michael was elected in his place. By 1972 Næss grew more and more concerned over the huge volume of new buildings, he feared a collapse of the market and was thus positive when approached by \"P&O\" and Hilmar Reksten who offered to buy his fleet. Næss had very mixed feelings as he had been in shipping for more than 40 years, however, with his experience and background as an economist he anticipated a downturn in the market. He did not have to wait long to see his decision pay off.\n\nIn July 1973 the deal was closed and \"Anglo Norness\" was sold for $208 million. Today it would equal $1.2-1.6 billion. In October the OPEC cartel quadrupled the oil price creating the 1973 oil crisis and the tanker market crashed. Næss was quite self-critical and had lambasted himself after other decisions; however, he had reasons to be proud of the perfect timing of this deal.\n\nEven though being a staunch defender of personal initiative and unregulated business, Næss supported organisations that could solve problems specific for the business area voluntarily. The reasoning behind INTERTANKO was to organise the independent tanker owners and solve problems particular to the tanker market. In the 1960s it was scrapping old vessels; after the 1973 oil crisis this problem surfaced again. With his large fleet of tankers Næss was a natural participant, and after being a member of the executive committee he was elected chairman in 1976. Due to the large number of new buildings the rates in 1975 gave the shipowners huge losses; some $125 million on Persian Gulf to Europe alone. Of a total tanker tonnage of close to were laid up, while an equal amount sailed with reduced speed.\n\nAs the INTERTANKO president Næss concentrated on scrapping old tonnage, pollution and utilizing supertankers as floating storage tanks. Scrapping older vessels would reduce the amount of surplus tonnage, and this would then in the long run produce better rates. In trying to reduce the surplus tonnage Næss however got into arguments with the US Justice Department as they were on the verge of viewing his actions as violating the anti-trust laws. His job of promoting scrapping of old tonnage was however made easier by the grounding of the \"Argo Merchant\" off Nantucket in December 1976, a 23-year-old run-down tanker. The spillage from the grounding pushed the major US oil companies to examine the vessels they were chartering closely, thus eliminating a large group of old, badly kept vessels.\n\nAs a citizen of Bermuda Næss was acutely aware of the problem with marine pollution; taking a walk on his beach he could easily spot lumps of tare that most probably came from tankers. Næss was therefore a staunch supporter of reducing oil waste as much as possible. Næss linked up with the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl who had himself witnessed the increased pollution during his expeditions. Næss pushed forward various recommendations that INTERTANKO then took to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN organisation responsible for improving maritime safety and to prevent marine pollution.\n\nNæss settled in Bermuda, buying land and building a hotel, but well into his old age seemed always on the lookout for a good deal that could have him started again in shipping. He made generous donations to Bergen, especially the museum documenting the old hanseatic influence on the city. His personal lifestyle was frugal as always; a striking contrast to his shipowner colleagues who kept large yachts and mansions.\n\nHe loved gardening, and guests at his hotel sometimes took pity on the old guy having to work in the garden, giving him a dollar as they passed by.\n\n\n"}

Born in Glasgow, Barrowman moved to the U.S. with his family in 1975. Encouraged by his high school teachers, he studied performing arts at the United States International University in San Diego before landing the role of Billy Crocker in Cole Porter's \"Anything Goes\" in London's West End. Since his debut, he has played lead roles in various musicals both in the West End and on Broadway, including \"Miss Saigon\", \"The Phantom of the Opera\", \"Sunset Boulevard\", and \"Matador\". After appearing in Sam Mendes' production of \"The Fix\", he was nominated for the 1998 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical and, in the early 2000s, returned to the role of Billy Crocker in the revival of \"Anything Goes\". His most recent West End credit was in the 2009 production of \"La Cage aux Folles\".\n\nAlongside his theatrical career, Barrowman has appeared in various films including the musical biopic \"De-Lovely\" (2004) and musical comedy \"The Producers\" (2005). Before venturing into British television, he featured in the American television dramas \"Titans\" and \"Central Park West\" but he is better known for his acting and presenting work for the BBC that includes his work for CBBC in its earlier years, his self-produced entertainment programme \"Tonight's the Night\", and his BAFTA Cymru-nominated role of Captain Jack Harkness in the science fiction series \"Doctor Who\" and \"Torchwood\". Barrowman has also had a number of guest roles in television programmes alongside both in the US and the UK. He appeared as a contestant on the first series of celebrity ice skating show \"Dancing on Ice\" while his theatrical background allowed him to become a judge on Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical talent shows \"How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?\", \"Any Dream Will Do\" and \"I'd Do Anything\". In 2006, he was voted Stonewall's Entertainer of the Year. He hosted the BBC One quiz show \"Pressure Pad\" in 2013 and 2014. Barrowman starred in The CW's \"Arrow\" and \"Legends of Tomorrow\" as Malcolm Merlyn.\n\nBarrowman is also featured on more than a dozen musical theatre recordings, including cover tunes found on his 2007 album, \"Another Side\", and 2008's \"Music Music Music\". Both albums accrued places on the UK Albums Chart, as did his self-titled \"John Barrowman\" (2010), which reached number 11, his highest chart placing to date. Furthermore, Barrowman has published two memoirs and autobiographies, \"Anything Goes\" (2008) and \"I Am What I Am\" (2009), with his sister Carole as co-author. The siblings also teamed up to write a novel, \"Hollow Earth\" (2012). The second book in the series, \"Bone Quill\", has been released in the UK and was released in the US in July 2013.\n\nJohn Scot Barrowman was born in Glasgow on 11 March 1967, the youngest of three children. His older sister, Carole, later became a university professor. He lived in Glasgow for the first eight years of his life. His mother was a singer who also worked in a record shop, while his father was employed by the Caterpillar heavy machinery company in nearby Uddingston. In 1975, his father's company relocated the family to the United States, where his father managed the Caterpillar tractor factory in Aurora, Illinois. The family settled in Joliet, Illinois, where Barrowman attended Joliet West High School in the heart of a \"quintessentially middle-class conservative town\". Barrowman's high school music and English teachers changed the future course of his life, with his music tutor instilling in him the love of performing, and his English teacher encouraging Barrowman to rise to his true artistic potential. His English teacher moved him into a Gifted Programme and coached him for the school's speech team. With the support of his teacher, he competed with other schools in statewide speech competitions, where he sharpened his skills reading scenes from plays.\n\nAfter his classmates mocked his native Scottish accent, Barrowman learned to speak with a General American accent, which hinted at the Mid-Atlantic accent. As a freshman, he won parts in several musical productions and from 1983 to 1986, he performed in such musical productions as \"Oliver!\", \"Camelot\", \"Hello, Dolly!\", \"Li'l Abner\", and \"Anything Goes\". Looking back, he acknowledged that \"without the support he received in high school, chances are that he would not now be appearing in royal command performances in the West End in front of the Royal Family or having Stephen Sondheim ask him to play opposite Carol Burnett\". Barrowman spent his senior year shovelling coal for an Illinois power company. His father had arranged the job (and similar jobs for his brother and sister) to give Barrowman the experience of manual labour. His father told him: \"If you want to do manual labour for the rest of your life you'll know that when you do it; it's a choice. But if you don't like it, you'll understand the importance of educating yourself and – if you decide what you want to do – being good at your craft or your skill.\" Barrowman worked for the power company for the entire summer, but did not like the job. Eventually, he convinced the company to move him to work in the storeroom.\n\nBarrowman graduated from high school in 1985, and he later became a naturalised U.S. citizen while retaining his British citizenship. After he graduated from high school, he attended the University of Iowa for a semester to study drama and music.\nHe then attended DePaul University, studying voice for a trimester, before performing at the Opryland for two summer seasons. He then transferred to the United States International University in January 1988, where he studied performing arts. As part of an student exchange programme, he returned to his native Britain in the summer of 1989 to study Shakespeare for six months, where he remained.\n\nBarrowman's professional acting career began in London's West End in October 1989, playing the role of Billy Crocker in Cole Porter's \"Anything Goes\" at the Prince Edward Theatre, alongside Elaine Paige as Reno Sweeney and Bernard Cribbins as Moonface Martin. He continued to appear in West End productions for the next decade, taking the title role of Domingo Hernandez in \"Matador\" at the Queen's Theatre in 1991; as Raoul in \"The Phantom of the Opera\" at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1992; as Claude in \"Hair\" at the Old Vic Theatre in 1993; as Chris in \"Miss Saigon\" at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1993; as Joe Gillis in \"Sunset Boulevard\" at the Adelphi Theatre from 1994–1995; and as Beast in \"Beauty and the Beast\" at the Dominion Theatre in 1999.\n\nBarrowman was part of the musical \"Godspell\" in 1994, and was a soloist in two songs, \"We Beseech Thee\" and \"On The Willows\". He was lead vocalist on a rendition of Strike Up the Band in \"Who Could Ask for Anything More? A Celebration of Ira Gershwin\" at the Royal Albert Hall in 1996, and he was nominated for an Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical in 1998 for originating the role of Cal Chandler in \"The Fix\", a performance he repeated in Cameron Mackintosh's 1998 gala concert \"Hey, Mr Producer!\". Barrowman played Joe Gillis in \"Sunset Boulevard\" in the West End and, briefly, on Broadway. His only other Broadway credit is in the role of Barry in the Stephen Sondheim revue \"Putting It Together\" (1999–2000) at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre opposite Carol Burnett and George Hearn.

Barrowman first starred as Peter Fairchild in \"Central Park West\" (1995) a show American film critic Ken Tucker calls \"a tale of ritzy, ditsy New York City careerists—some struggling to make it, others plotting to retain their status and power.\" Television critic David Hiltbrand called Barrowman's character a \"Prince Charming ... a virtuous, hardworking assistant DA who keeps getting distracted by women who swoon in his path.\" Tucker noted Barrowman's character of Peter Fairchild to be \"physically an eye-widening cross between John Kennedy Jr. and Hugh Grant\". The show lasted for two seasons on CBS, from September 1995 to June 1996. Barrowman then appeared as Peter Williams in \"Titans\" (2000). According to writer Joanna Bober, in \"Titans\", Barrowman plays a \"ruthless mogul\" who gains \"control of the family's private aviation company (a fleet of 'Titans') from his semi-retired father\" while increasing the profitability of the company amidst a series of soap opera intrigues. \"Titans\" was cancelled after airing eleven episodes. Barrowman was also considered for the role of Will in \"Will and Grace\", but the producers reportedly felt he was \"too straight\" and the role eventually went to straight actor Eric McCormack instead.

By July 2016, he signed a deal that allows him to continue being a series regular on \"Arrow\" as well as the other superhero shows produced by Greg Berlanti, including \"The Flash\" and \"Legends of Tomorrow\". In the \"Flash\" third-season episode \"Duet\", he plays gangster Cutter Moran in the dreamworld the Music Meister sets up. Despite announcing in May 2017 that he is leaving the Arrowverse television franchise, Barrowman returned as Malcolm Merlyn in the second part of the Elseworlds crossover, hallucinated by Barry Allen, situated in a universe rewritten by the Book of Destiny where Allen is perceived to be Oliver Queen.

Jack became so popular, he was given his own show – \"Torchwood\", a \"Doctor Who\" spin-off series featuring a team of alien hunters based in modern-day Cardiff, which premiered in 2006. American film and television critic Ken Tucker describes Barrowman's role on \"Torchwood\" as \"dashing\", \"utterly fabulous\", \"celestially promiscuous\", and \"like Tom Cruise with suspenders, but minus the Scientology\". In the show, Jack \"tracks down—and occasionally beds—ETs with the help of his quartet of bedazzled groupies—slash—Experts in Their Fields: One's a doctor, one's a cop, one's a scientist, and one... makes coffee and late nights piping hot. It's like the Justice League of Extended-Pinkie Nerds.\"\n\nBarrowman continued to guest star in \"Doctor Who\" in 2007, appearing in \"Utopia\", \"The Sound of Drums\", and \"Last of the Time Lords\". He also participated in a \"Doctor Who\" special on the BBC's \"The Weakest Link\".

His sister, English professor and journalist Carole Barrowman, helped write the book using her brother's dictations. In 2009, Barrowman published \"I Am What I Am\", his second memoir detailing his recent television work and musings on fame.\n\nBarrowman's first published work of original fiction was a \"Torchwood\" comic strip, titled \"Captain Jack and the Selkie\", co-written with sister Carole. Commenting on the characterisation of Jack Harkness in the comic strip Barrowman states: \"We'd already agreed to tell a story that showed a side of Jack and a part of his history that hadn't been explored too much in other media. I wanted to give fans something original about Jack.\" Barrowman's début fantasy novel titled \"Hollow Earth\", co-written with his sister Carole, was published in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2012 by Buster Books. The novel is about twins Matt and Emily (\"Em\") Calder who share an ability that allows them to make artwork come to life, due to their powerful imaginations. Their ability is sought after by antagonists who wish to use it to breach Hollow Earth—a realm in which all demons and monsters are trapped. Two sequels from the same team concerning Hollow Earth followed – \"The Bone Quill\" (2013) and \"The Book of Beasts\" (2014) – and \"Conjuror\" (2016), the first in a new series (the \"Orion Chronicles\") featuring the same twins, as well as a separate novel \"Torchwood: Exodus Code\" (2013).\n\nBarrowman worked with Stonewall, a gay rights organisation in the UK, on the \"Education for All\" campaign against homophobia in schools. In April 2008, the group placed posters on 600 billboards that read, \"Some people are gay.

In the 2012 presidential election, Barrowman endorsed Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama, who was running for re-election. Barrowman publicly supported Scotland remaining in the United Kingdom in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, and was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to \"The Guardian\" opposing Scottish independence.\n\nBarrowman is openly gay; he met his husband, Scott Gill, during a production of \"Rope\" at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 1993, after Gill came to see Barrowman in the play. They share homes in London, Cardiff, and Palm Springs. Barrowman and Gill entered into a civil partnership on 27 December 2006. A small ceremony was held in Cardiff with friends and family, with the cast of \"Torchwood\" and executive producer Russell T Davies as guests. The pair were legally married in California on 2 July 2013, following the Supreme Court's decision to deny an appeal against the reversal of California Proposition 8.\n\nOn 30 November 2008, Barrowman exposed himself during an episode of Radio 1's \"Switch\" programme. Although the act was not seen (a show staff member had covered the webcam), the BBC and Barrowman subsequently apologized for any offence caused.\n\nIn 2011, Barrowman released his own skin care line, entitled HIM.\n\nIn mid-March 2017, Barrowman and his husband held a \"big bad garage sale\" in their Palm Springs home. The garage sale was packed with \"Doctor Who\" and \"Torchwood\" memorabilia. Neighbours and fans showed up for the occasion and Barrowman documented most of the day on his social media accounts via pictures and short videos.\n\nPerforms two songs in \"The Flash\" episode, \"Duet\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is an American sociologist and professor. She describes herself as a humanistic psychoanalytic sociologist and psychoanalytic feminist. Throughout her career, she has been influenced by psychoanalysts Sigmund Freud and Karen Horney, as well as feminist theorists Beatrice Whiting and Phillip Slater. She is a member of the International Psychoanalytical Association, and often speaks at its congresses. She began as a professor at Wellesley College in 1973, a year later she began at the University of California, Santa Cruz until 1986. She then went on to spend many years as a professor in the departments of sociology and clinical psychology at the University of California, Berkeley until her retirement in 2005. Later, she began her career teaching psychiatry at Harvard Medical School/Cambridge Health Alliance. Chodorow is often described as a leader in feminist thought, especially in the realms of psychoanalysis and psychology.\n\nChodorow has written a number of influential books in contemporary feminist writing, including \"The Reproduction of Mothering: Psychoanalysis and the Sociology of Gender\" (1978); \"Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory\" (1989); \"Femininities, Masculinities, Sexualities: Freud and Beyond\" (1994); and \"The Power of Feelings: Personal Meaning in Psychoanalysis, Gender, and Culture\" (1999). In 1995, Chodorow was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship for Social Sciences. In 1996, \"The Reproduction of Mothering\" was chosen by \"Contemporary Sociology\" as one of the ten most influential books of the past 25 years.\n\nBorn on January 20, 1944, in New York, New York to a Jewish family. Her parents were Marvin and Leah Chodorow. Her father was a professor of applied physics. Chodorow married Michael Reich, a professor of economics. They had two children, Rachel and Gabriel. In 1977, they separated.\n\nChodorow graduated from Radcliffe College in 1966. There she studied under Beatrice and W.M. Whiting. Chodorow's work focused on personality and cultural anthropology now classified as pre-feminist work. She focused on the study of personality through a Freudian lens. In 1975, she received her Ph.D. in sociology from Brandeis University. Under the instruction of Philip Slater, Chodorow was influenced to focus her studies on the unconscious phenomena of psychoanalysis. Following her Ph.D., Chodorow received clinical training at the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute from 1985 to 1993.\n\nChodorow's most profound influence stems from Freudian psychoanalysis. She incorporates Freudian analysis with a feminist perspective to understand the mother-child relationship. Chodorow uses the Freudian model of female development to reveal that a girl's gender development is related to her closeness with her mother. Therefore, the girl is pursuing a privilege that a boy has already achieved. The boy has already received this attention, because he is more valued by the mother, as an object since he is a source of her own Oedipal gratification. However, the boy has both the need and the ability to detach himself from his mother. The female solves her inner conflict by converting her envy of male privilege into heterosexual desire. Using Freudian psychoanalytic theory, Chodorow explains that the Oedipus complex symbolically separates the male child from his mother, but young girls continue to identify with their mother. Chodorow notes that Freud's theory of the Oedipal conflict and the Oedipal revolution is due to chance; the father must be in the right place at the right time. Chodorow's analysis led to the hypothesis that a female's desire for men is a direct result of her strong desire for her mother.\n\nAdditionally, Chodorow uses Sigmund Freud's theory to explain that the differences between men and women are largely due to capitalism and the absent father. Chodorow acknowledges the ways in which the economy changed in 2003, and the psychological impact this had on both sexes in regards to shared parenting. The development of shared parenting has challenged the traditional mothering role, resulting in a paradigm where mother and children have insufficient time for each other.\n\nChodorow also argues that Freudian theory suppresses women. Nonetheless, the theory provides grounds for how people become gendered, how femininity and masculinity develops, and how sexism via sexual inequality is reproduced. Furthermore, Freud explains how nature becomes culture resulting in a second nature. Chodorow argues that this explains that the formation and organization of gender occur, not only through social institutions, but also through transformations in the consciousness and the psyche.\n\nChodorow draws on Freud's idea of intraspsychic structures to understand the developmental differences between girls and boys. Freud explains that there are three parts to an individual: the id, the ego, and the super-ego. These parts produce rigid boundaries in the internal workings of our brains and impact our interactions in society. Chodorow uses this intrapsychic structure to explain that the internal workings of males and females are structurally different. Therefore, developmental differences are not inherent, rather these differences are produced through socialization.\n\nChodorow also draws influence from Karen Horney, a 20th-century psychoanalyst who challenged Freudian ideas, ultimately leading to the foundation of feminist psychology. Horney argued against Freud's idea that females are defective or limited, and rather argued an that women possess positive feminine qualities and self valuation. \n\nNancy Chodorow studied under the sociologist Philip Slater while she was earning her PhD at Brandeis University in 1975. Slater encouraged her to study unconscious phenomena in order to deepen her understanding of personality. Chodorow refers to Slater's book, \"Glory of Hera\", as one of the most influential books in regards to a man's immense fear of women and its manifestation in culture. \n\nChodorow views mothering as a dual structure, where motherhood is partly fixed by childhood experience and the social structure of kinship. She explains that the process of a woman becoming a mother goes beyond biology and instinct alone. Chodorow argues in her book, \"The Reproduction of Mothering\" (1978; 2nd ed., 1999), that gender differences are compromised from formations of the Oedipal complex. She begins with Freud's assertion that the individual is born bisexual and that the child's mother is its first sexual object. Chodorow, drawing on the work of Karen Horney and Melanie Klein, notes that the child forms its ego in reaction to the dominating figure of the mother. The male child forms this sense of independent agency easily, identifying with the agency and freedom of the father, and emulating his possessive interest in the mother/wife. This task is not as simple for the female child. The mother identifies with her more strongly, and the daughter attempts to make the father her new love object. The female child is then is stymied in her ego formation by the intense bond with the mother. Where male children typically experience love as a dyadic relationship, daughters are caught in a libidinal triangle where the ego is pulled between love for the father, the love of the mother, and concern and worry over the relationship of the father to the mother.\n\nThe strong bond between the mother and the infant, not only shapes her identity, but allows the child to acknowledge that the father is a separate being. Except, in circumstances where the father provides a similar form of primary care as the mother. This separation of the father and child can result in the child developing an ambivalence with the father. Therefore, the child is confused by the failure to recognize the mother's separateness. Consequently, children are more obedient to their father, but not because he is considered the authority figure or because of his strictness, but rather because of the child's initial relationship to the father.\n\n\"The mother is the early caregiver and primary source of identification for all children... A daughter continues to identify with the mother.\" Sociologically, Chodorow explains that the strong bond between mother and daughter inhibits the daughter from forming her own identity. The first bonding beings in infancy with the mother. This initial bond is true for both sexes, except, boys breakaway at an early age to identify with their fathers. Thus, maintaining the mother-daughter relationship and identity.\n\nFor Chodorow, the contrast between the dyadic and triadic first love experiences explains the social construction of gender roles. This is through the universal degradation of women in culture, cross-cultural patterns in male behavior, and marital strain in Western society after Second Wave feminism. In marriage, the woman takes less of an interest in sex and more in the children. Her ambivalence towards sex eventually drives the male away. She devotes her energies to the children once she does reach sexual maturity.\n\nFurthermore, Chodorow examines the psychological development of adult females and males. Chodorow argues that the psyches of men and women are structured differently because of dissimilar childhood experiences. The justification for why women tend to be more empathic is because women's ego boundaries are less fixed. Chodorow hypothesizes that if women are perceived by society as primarily and exclusively as mothers, then any liberation of women will continue to be experienced as traumatic by society.\n\nChodorow argues that masculinity learned in the absence of an ongoing personal relationship with the father and without an available masculine role model, boys are taught more consciously how to be masculine. Boys' development of masculinity is used as a tool that would be used against them by the father. Therefore, masculine identity is due to gender role development. On the other hand, femininity is less consciously instilled in girls rather it is embedded in the ongoing relationship to the mother. Thus, female identification is predominantly parental.\n\n“Masculinity is defined as much negatively as positively.” Chodorow argues that the production of feminine identification is a rational process. In comparison, the production of male identification is defined by rejection rather than acceptance.\n\nIn her book, \"Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory\", Chodorow expands on the finding that a man's suppression and denial of his need for love, often leads to an inability to tolerate others who can express their desire for love. Women, on the other hand, have not suppressed these needs, and thus may be willing to deal with their lover or husband being somewhat emotionally unresponsive, in exchange for some amount of caring and love. Since this desire for love cannot be silenced through repression, men will simultaneously protect themselves against the threat of invasion by women, while still being in a heterosexual relationship. Chodorow suggests that if the father figure could become more visible and participatory in family life, then the emotional ambiguities in both sexes would be rectified. \n\nChodorow further synthesizes the female closeness with the mother quiets the sex drive toward men, because their inner emotional lives are far more satisfied. On the other hand, she suggests that the intense sex drive of men is a result of repression, and thus men fall in love much more romantically. She argues that this idea may be the basis for male aggression toward women.\n\nAdditionally, Chodorow focuses on the ways in which society values women for \"being,\" but men for \"action.\" More specifically, women are often viewed as objects, but men are rather viewed as subjects. She suggests that this idea has deeper implications, as women tend to be very relationship-oriented. Chodorow ties this idea back to Freudian theory by arguing that men pay a price for the rushed detachment from their mother, and the resulting repression of their feminine selves. \n\nChodorow has received some criticism by sociologists for lacking empirical evidence and for her individualistic approach to social theory. Other sociologists argue that she lacks emphasis on the impact of social reality in her theories, and does not understand the idea of social determinism. Conversely, Lacanian psychoanalytic feminists argue that she is too empirical and socially deterministic. They further argue against her view of the unconscious as a sociological phenomena rather than an indisputable level of analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the largest commune in the Allier department, although the department's préfecture is located in the smaller town of Moulins. Its inhabitants are known as \"Montluçonnais\". The town is in the traditional province of Bourbonnais and was part of the mediaeval duchy of Bourbon.\n\nMontluçon is located in the northwest of the Allier department near the frontier of the Centre-Val de Loire and Nouvelle Aquitaine regions.\n\nMontluçon is linked with surrounding regions and towns via four main road axes, plus the highway A71 from Orléans to Clermont-Ferrand; through a railway linking in the North Vierzon then Paris (3-5h). Formerly the canal de Berry linked Montluçon towards the north.\n\nMontluçon is south of Bourges, from Paris, from Clermont-Ferrand, (3h) from Lyon, (2h) from Limoges and from the Atlantic coast.\n\nMontluçon is close to the \"Méridienne verte\" (an architectural project marking the Paris meridian) and to the Greenwich meridian.\n\nMontluçon is also close to the geographic centre of Metropolitan France.\n\nMontluçon was built in the Middle Ages. The first mention of a place called \"Monte Lucii\" (Mont de Lucius) dates from the eleventh century. Guillaume, son of Archambaud IV of Bourbon, built the castle in a defensible position on a small rocky hill on a bend in the Cher River.\n\nThe town, which formed part of the duchy of Bourbon, was taken by the English in 1171, and by Philip Augustus in 1181; the English were finally driven out in the 14th century.\n\nIn the 14th century, Louis II de Bourbon re-built the castle and walls. Montluçon and other Bourbon lands reverted to the French crown in 1529, and Henry IV further improved the defenses.\n\nMontluçon became the administrative seat of the area in 1791, then entered the industrial era thanks to the presence of coalpits distant in Commentry, the Canal de Berry in 1830 and the railway in 1864. These transport links allowed the import of ore and export of coal, wood and manufactured goods. The population grew from 5000 inhabitants in 1830 to 50 000 in 1950.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Germans occupied the Dunlop tyre plant (even though Montluçon was in the free zone) to exploit the research laboratory to synthesize rubber, since natural rubber could not be imported by the Nazis. The manufacturing of tyres for Luftwaffe aircraft was also of interest for the Nazis.\n\nFor this reason, the Allies bombed the site on 12–16 September 1943, as well as part of the nearby town Saint-Victor, causing 36 deaths and injuring more than 250 civilians.\n\nA notable act of resistance occurred in the city on January 6, 1943 when a mob of citizens overran guards supervising a massive deportation of men to Germany in accordance with the \"Service de Travail Obligatoire\" (Obligatory Work Service) plan that sent able Frenchmen to fill vacancies in German factories during the war. All the men who were to be deported managed to escape into the countryside, evading the forced industrial service awaiting them in the Reich.\n\nSince 1945, traditional industry (blast furnaces and glassware) has declined. Today Montluçon has chemical industries, tyre manufacture (Dunlop), and electronics (Sagem), and more recently a technopole at La Loue was established for high-tech companies.\n\nNew Zealand-born Australian Nancy Wake, the most decorated woman of World War II, led her small army of resistance fighters in the countryside around Montluçon. On March 11, 2013 Nancy Wake's ashes were scattered in a small wood outside Montluçon. The ceremony was followed by a civic reception in the town. Wake died in August 2011, aged 98.\n\nThere is a small airport from Montluçon (Montluçon - Guéret Airport) with flights mainly for Paris, and a smaller aerodrome in Montluçon itself (Montluçon - Domérat Aerodrome).\nThe nearest international airports are Clermont-Ferrand Airport and Limoges Airport.\n\nMontluçon is linked to French and European road networks, by three major routes:\n\nThe Gare de Montluçon-Ville railway station is served by three main passenger rail lines.\n\nMontluçon's local buses are run by Maelis.\n\nThe upper town, on the right bank of the Cher, consists of steep, narrow, winding streets, and preserves several buildings of the 15th and 16th centuries. The lower town, traversed by the Cher, is the industrial zone.\n\nThe church of Notre-Dame dates from the fourteenth century, the church of St Pierre partly from the 12th. The town hall, with a library, occupies the site of an old Ursuline convent, and two other convents are used as a college and hospital. Overlooking the town is the castle rebuilt by Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, and taken by Henry IV during the French Wars of Religion; it serves as a barracks.\n\n\n\nMontluçon is twinned with:\n\nAdministration:\nMontluçon is a sub-prefecture and has courts, a board of trade arbitration, a chamber of commerce and several schools (general public, private, commercial).\n\nSport:\n\nMontluçon was the birthplace of:\n\n\n"}

Lees escaped her attacker, but Falconio was never found, and in 2005 Murdoch was convicted of his murder. Lees was the chief crown witness in the subsequent murder trial of Bradley John Murdoch conducted in Darwin. She later wrote a 2006 book, and this was made into a , about her experiences.\n\nLees was born on 25 September 1973, and lived her first 11 years with her mother Jenny (who had separated from her father). Her mother then remarried to Vincent, who already had a son named Sam, and the new family of four lived in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England. During high school and later studies, she had several part-time jobs as a barmaid, and bacon packer, before securing a job at her local Thomas Cook travel agency.\n\nLees first met Falconio in a nightclub in Huddersfield in 1996 and began living with him the following year in Brighton, England where Falconio was studying at Brighton University. She then transferred her job to a local Cook agency, before the couple took short trips to Italy, Greece and Jamaica. From 1998, the couple had planned a trip to Thailand, Singapore, and Australia (though recent news of the Backpacker Murders, Port Arthur killings, and Childers Palace Backpackers Hostel fire there had made their families anxious). On 15 November 2000, the couple departed, travelling through Nepal, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia (where Lees' traveller's cheques and return ticket were stolen). By 16 January 2001, they had arrived in Sydney on a working holiday visa, and Lees then job-hunted, finally securing work at the Dymocks bookstore on George Street. After five months, in which the couple had enjoyed Sydney's night-scene, Falconio purchased a car for the next stage of their travel plan, a road trip from Sydney to Melbourne, Adelaide, Darwin, and Brisbane.\n\nFalconio and Lees were travelling at night along the Stuart Highway near Barrow Creek (between Alice Springs and Tennant Creek) in the Northern Territory, outback Australia, on 14 July 2001, when a man in another vehicle flagged them down, and told them that he had noticed that their camper van had engine trouble. After Falconio went to the rear of the vehicle with the man to investigate, Lees heard a shot. The man then threatened Lees with a gun, and tied her up, but she escaped while he was distracted (apparently while moving Falconio's body). She hid for five hours in nearby bushes before running out onto the road and flagging down a truck driver who took her to safety.\n\nIn the aftermath of attack, Lees was both supported and suspected by the media (as had happened in the Chamberlain case). Expert testimony presented at the trial indicated that Bradley Murdoch was the man captured in the CCTV footage at the service station. Lees identified Murdoch from police photographs shown to her in November 2002 by NT Police and finally face-to-face during the trial on 18 October 2005. This, combined with the DNA match on Lees' T-shirt, formed the case for Murdoch being charged with the murder. DNA testing procedure and this DNA result greatly assisted in the conviction of Murdoch. Murdoch was found guilty by a jury in a unanimous verdict.\n\nLees agreed to an interview with Martin Bashir, which was later televised in Australia, for which she was paid £50,000. She later testified in court that she had agreed to this interview to raise awareness of the case in Australia, as she felt the public profile of the case had diminished.\n\nLees wrote \"No Turning Back\", a book about her life. She went to the UK for the launch of the book in October 2006 and a serialisation appeared in \"The Times\" newspaper on 2 and 3 October. A lengthy interview with Lees was aired on Andrew Denton's show, \"Enough Rope\" on 9 October 2006. On 9 October 2006, Lees was interviewed on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 by John Humphrys. On 10 October 2006, Lees was interviewed by BBC News 24.\n\nIn July 2011, Lees was interviewed by Australia's Woman's Day in the lead-up to the tenth anniversary of the murder of Peter Falconio. She stated that she was still single and living a solitary life, and had worked at a travel agency and as a social worker with disabled people. She had also studied sociology at Sheffield University.\n\nOn 12 February 2017, Australia's Nine Network presented a 60 Minutes extended interview with Joanne Lees who \"is determined to honour her partner's memory by confronting the awful past.\" Australian sculptor Ewen Coates is working with Lees to construct a memorial for Falconio at the crime scene.\n\nIn March 2007, Channel Ten in Australia presented a docudrama covering events from the night of the murder through to sentencing, from Lees' perspective. The roles of Lees and Falconio were played by Joanne Froggatt and Laurence Breuls. It was also shown by ITV1 in the UK on 8 April 2007, by TV One in New Zealand on 10 June 2007 and by RTL 2 in Germany on 12 January 2009.\n\n"}

He will be 74 when eligible for parole in 2032. Murdoch is being held in Darwin Correctional Centre in Darwin, Northern Territory. He has lodged two appeals against his conviction; both of which were unsuccessful. The High Court of Australia refused special leave to appeal on 21 June 2007. He is forbidden to talk to the press.\n\nMurdoch was born on 19 February 1958 in Geraldton, Western Australia, an unexpected third son (the others were aged 11 and 14) to parents Colin Murdoch (a mechanic) and Nancy Murdoch (a hairdresser). The family lived in nearby Northampton, before moving to Perth when he was 12 years old. Murdoch had problems adjusting to city life, and soon became involved with a biker gang.\n\nAt 15 years old, he left high school and moved back to Geraldton where he started becoming involved in biker gang criminal activities. He also had his own trucking business, but declared bankruptcy in 1983. In 1980, he had met his partner Dianne, whom he married in July 1984 – they had a son, but they were separated by 1986 due to domestic violence. He was then employed as a truck driver (and illicit-drug smuggler), and admitted in court to smuggling large amounts of cannabis. He also began to display white supremacist tendencies (particularly in the wake of the 1992 Mabo decision), alongside a racist tattoo. By 1998, after release from prison, he was living in Derby, running drugs, and driving road trains, before resettling in Broome and running drugs to Sedan.\n\n\nShortly after his acquittal for unrelated rape and abduction charges, Murdoch was arrested in 2003 and charged with the murder of Peter Falconio on a remote part of the Stuart Highway near Barrow Creek on 14 July 2001. The case was heard before the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in Darwin, and began on 17 October 2005. Murdoch pleaded not guilty to charges of murdering Peter Falconio and assaulting and attempting to kidnap his girlfriend Joanne Lees. Murdoch was convicted on 13 December 2005 for Falconio's murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 28 years. He was also convicted of other assault-related charges on Joanne Lees.\n\nOn 12 December 2006, he appealed against his life sentence in the Supreme Court, claiming the evidence of Lees was tainted because she had seen a photograph of him on the internet before she was interviewed by police, as well as an article linking him to the murder. The appeal was dismissed on 10 January 2007. In mid-August 2007, some sections of the Australian media speculated that Murdoch might soon reveal the whereabouts of Falconio's remains. Specifically, the press mentioned that Murdoch did not enjoy the conditions of the Berrimah Prison, on the outskirts of Darwin and might reveal the location of Falconio's body in exchange for a transfer to a prison in Western Australia, given that all avenues of appeal had been exhausted. An appeal to the High Court was unsuccessful. He launched another appeal to the Northern Territory criminal court of appeal in 2013; the appeal was later withdrawn by his lawyers in March of 2014 .\n"}

It is located on the Stuart Highway, about 280 km north of Alice Springs, about halfway from there to Tennant Creek. The main feature of the town is the roadhouse/hotel. A number of mining companies are currently exploring in the area, although none of the current residents are involved in the mining industry.\n\nThe Barrow Creek area is the traditional home of the Kaytetye Aboriginal people. Humans have lived in Australia, and perhaps this area, for at least 40,000 years.\n\nWith the arrival of Europeans in the latter part of the 19th century, settlers competed with the Kaytetye for land and resources. Cultural misunderstandings on land and property rights resulted in mutual killings.\n\nJohn McDouall Stuart passed through the area in 1860. He named a creek near the current town after John Henry Barrow, a preacher, journalist and politician who was born in England in 1817 and migrated to South Australia in 1853. At the time of first European habitation of the site, he was the Treasurer of South Australia.\n\nBarrow Creek was chosen as a site for an Overland Telegraph morse repeater station by John Ross in September 1871. The station was officially opened on 16 August 1872 by Charles Todd. It was one of 15 such repeater stations on a network traversing Australia and linking to Europe, providing essential communication services. A manned repeater station in newer buildings remained in operation until at least the 1970s. There was also a post office and telephone exchange servicing local cattle stations. The original Telegraph Station has been preserved and is now a monument to the troubles which beset the early days of the Territory.\n\nIn 1873, 5,000 sheep were overlanded from Adelaide by Alfred Giles for distribution to Telegraph Stations along the line. During 1877 and 1878 Alfred Giles and Arthur Giles overlanded stock for W. J. Browne to the Katherine River. On the 1878 journey Frank Withall, a young Englishman, was included on the suggestion of Browne \"to gather some colonial experience\". Alfred Giles later started Springvale, Delamere and the Newcastle Waters runs.\n\nDuring the Second World War Barrow Creek was used by the Australian Army as a staging camp for convoys of troops and supplies, which was known as No. 5 Australian Personnel Staging Camp. It was the first overnight stop on the northern trip from Alice Springs to Birdum.\n\nBarrow Creek has always had a problem with both quantity and quality of groundwater supplies. This problem was already recognized in the 1870s, and only 20 years after the Telegraph Station was built there is evidence of plans to shift it about 40 kilometres further north to the crossing at Taylor Creek because of better groundwater supplies. There is still a bore at that locality called New Barrow Bore. Today, the only good water at Barrow Creek is rainwater and that is limited due to the arid climate.\n\nDuring 1870 some 3,000 sheep from the Lake Hope area in South Australia were overlanded to the Northern Territory, for the men working on the line at Roper River, by Ralph and John Milner. Near Wauchope Creek 900 sheep died after eating poisonous herbs. John Milner was killed by the Aborigines and Ralph arrived at the Roper River with only 1,000 sheep.\n\nOn 22 February 1874, a group of Kaytetye men attacked the Overland Telegraph repeater station at Barrow Creek, whose staff were relaxing outside the compound, immediately killing linesman John Frank, mortally wounding Canadian telegraphist and stationmaster James Lawrence Stapleton (died on the following day) and injuring several others. A monument was erected at Barrow Creek to their memory (the spelling \"Franks\" is almost certainly incorrect). \nContemporary press reports described the incident as the \"Barrow's Creek outrage\".\n\nOn orders from Adelaide, police trooper Samuel Gason recruited a group of volunteers to apprehend the perpetrators. Several Aborigines were killed in two separate battles over the two months that followed, with Gason reporting that some of the dead had been identified as having taken part in the 'outrage'. Anthropologist Ted Strehlow reported in 1932 that Alex Ross, who'd visited the area in 1875, doubted whether the real culprits had been found. \"Well of course nobody ever knew,\" Ross was quoted as saying.\n\nBarrow Creek was central to the last major Aboriginal massacre in the Northern Territory. In the 1920s Mounted Constable William George Murray was in charge of the local police station and also the Chief Protector of Aborigines in the area. When an old dingo trapper, Fred Brooks, was killed by Aborigines on Coniston Station, Murray led a posse which killed an estimated 70 Aborigines in a series of bloody reprisals. When Murray was called to Darwin to explain his actions he was greeted as a conquering hero. When asked why he had taken no prisoners he expressed the racist attitudes which prevailed at the time by telling the Darwin court \"What use is a wounded black feller a hundred miles from civilisation?\" He was exonerated of all charges.\n\nBarrow Creek has recently become famous for being the closest town to the location of where Peter Falconio was murdered by Bradley John Murdoch, and Joanne Lees was abducted. The scene of the crime was 13 kilometres to the north of Barrow Creek.\n\nThe graves are marked by a wall around the graves and headstones. They are well looked after. In a small graveyard at the front are remains of two telegraph station workers killed in a surprise attack by Aboriginals in 1874.\n\nThe old pub was built in 1926 by Joe Kilgariff, uncle of Northern Territory senator Bernie Kilgariff, and it still has the original old bar, underground cellar and tin ceilings. There is accommodation outside and rooms inside and a caravan park. On the wall in the kitchen of the building is a cartoon of two Australian comic icons, \"Bluey and Curley\", drawn by the artist John Gurney when he passed through during the Second World War. The hotel is a popular stop for travellers along the highway and contains a tremendous collection of memorabilia and items of interest which have been gathered over the years. The current publican of 25 years, Lesley Pilton, initiated what he terms the \"Barrow Creek Bank\" - travellers post on the wall a signed banknote of their native country, \"to be used in a later journey in case they need a beer\".\n\nFor many years the Telegraph Station was the home of Tom Roberts, a linesman from Charters Towers who lived in the building and repaired breakdowns of the line. Now deceased, a corner of the hotel is devoted to his memory.\n\nPart of the Graham Masterton novel ‘’Lords of the Air’’ is set in Barrow Creek.\n\nThe population of Barrow Creek at the moment is 4 people who work at the roadhouse and nearby Aboriginal camp caretaker yard. There are two Aboriginal communities - the Tara community which is 12 km northeast and Pmatajunata at Stirling Station which is about 35 km from Barrow Creek. There are about 120 people there and 80 people at Tara.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1921552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921552", "title": "El Caracol, Michoacán", "text": "El Caracol, Michoacán\n\nEl Caracol is a small village in the mountains of the Mexican state of Michoacán, in the municipality of Hidalgo. It is located off the State route of Mexico-Morelia-Guadalajara, about 12 km (7.5 mi) south of Mil Cumbres at an elevation of 2896 m (9501 ft) above mean sea level. Seasonal temperatures vary from 40–79 °F (4–26 °C) July to February and 60–89 °F (16–32 °C) March to June with relatively low humidity. There are almost no mosquitoes, snakes or other pests.\n\nEl Caracol is said to be one of the oldest villages in the region dating as far back to the mid-15th century. There are few records of its history, only tales of the native people that passed them on from generation to generation.\n\nFolk tales tell of a very painful separation caused by two priests. One decided to relocate the village because the terrain where it was located would not allow it to grow, and most of the people followed the priest to a valley now known as San Antonio Villalongin. The rivalry started when San Antonio's priest wanted to take all the church's belongings (saints and a three-ton gold-plated bell). There are accounts of trying to drag the four foot San Isidro Labrador statue out the temple and the statue would not fit out the door. After the unsuccessful robbery the evil priest walked up the mountain to La Cruz del Toro and cursed the town.\n\nIn the late-1970s and 1980s, El Caracol was a major lumbermill center with up to 34 lumberyards, cabinetry, and bedboard making shops, producing thousands of woodcrafting products and distributing them throughout the Mexican Republic. The population of the village grew close to 5,000. The primary, tele-secondary schools, and a bigger temple were built to accommodate the increasing population.\n\nEl Caracol has been a stepping stone. In the 1950s and 1960s people from the surrounding villages migrated to El Caracol, while the natives moved to Mexico City. Similarly in the 1980s and 1990s people from El Caracol started migrating to Morelia and the United States – especially to Los Angeles, CA; Chicago, IL; and Atlanta, GA – and people from surrounding villages such as La Palma, San Juan, El Astillero and others moved to El Caracol.\n\nNow there are only about 2,700 people left in the village, most of whom are under 15 or over 45 years old. A few left to Morelia to continue their studies and the majority are working in the United States.\n\nTraditional village ceremonies include a re-enactment of the Birth, Last Supper and the Passion of Christ. Another big tradition is the migration on July 16 the day of La Virgen Del Carmen.\n\nFiesta De San Isidro Labrador 2017\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT-UrMra3Ek&t=36s\n\nAvocado Farm\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbIm6lV1Aiw\n\nEl Caracol y sus alrededores\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0cAjsripWE&t=9s\n\nVisit the Spanish version for more pictures or https://web.archive.org/web/20120311213643/http://gavpa13.webs.com/,\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDm9UqtI4Xk,\nor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT-UrMra3Ek&t=36s https://www.panoramio.com/photo/15083557\n"}
{"id": "1921562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921562", "title": "Sierra de la Plata", "text": "Sierra de la Plata\n\nThe Sierra de la Plata (\"Silver Mountains\") was a mythical source of silver in the interior of South America. The legend began in the early 16th century when castaways from the Juan Díaz de Solís expedition heard indigenous stories of a mountain of silver in an inland region ruled by the so-called White King. The first European to lead an expedition in search of it was the castaway Aleixo Garcia, who crossed nearly the entire continent to reach the Andean altiplano. On his way back to the coast, Garcia died in an ambush by indigenous tribespeople in Paraguay, but survivors brought precious metals back to corroborate their story. The legend inspired other expeditions, all of which ended in failure.\n\nThe Río de la Plata (literally \"Silver River\") and the modern country of Argentina (from the Latin \"argentum\", \"silver\") both take their names from the myth. The legend of the Sierra de la Plata may have been based on the Cerro Rico de Potosí in Bolivia, which was discovered by a Spanish expedition traveling from Peru in 1545.\n\nThe legend of the White King and the Sierra de la Plata began with the expeditions of Juan Díaz de Solís along the coast of South America. On his first voyage in 1512, Solís followed the coast of Brazil until he came across an enormous estuary, the Río de la Plata, which Amerigo Vespucci had named the River Jordan on his 1501-02 expedition and the local inhabitants called Paranaguazu (\"river like the sea\" or \"great water\"). Solís decided to call it the Mar Dulce (\"Freshwater Sea\") due to its great size. After exploring the area and guessing it could be a strait connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific, Solís returned to Spain to stake his claim as conqueror and governor of the region. In 1516, he returned with the title of Captain General, but when Solís and his party landed on the eastern bank of the Río de la Plata, they were attacked and killed by Guaranís. Seeing this, the crew remaining on the ships decided to weigh anchor and return to Spain.\n\nOn their way back to Europe, one of the Solís expedition's vessels shipwrecked off the coast of Santa Catarina Island in what is now Brazil, leaving eighteen men stranded. One of them, the Portuguese explorer Aleixo Garcia, became friendly with the local Tupí-Guaranís, and through them learned of a great mountain of shining metals far into the mainland.\n\nGarcia left Santa Catarina along with other castaways and a large indigenous party to search for the Sierra de la Plata, crossing most of South America before reaching the Andean altiplano. This was supposedly the home of the White King, whose throne was entirely decorated with silver. After taking a few valuable pieces, the explorers headed back to the Brazilian coast, but along the way, Aleixo Garcia and the other Europeans were killed in a Payaguá ambush. The few Tupí-Guaranís who managed to escape told their story, showing off the silver pieces they had gotten from the realms of the White King.\n\nIn 1526, the Venetian explorer Sebastian Cabot left Spain with the goal of reaching the Molucca Islands in Indonesia by way of the Straits of Magellan. During a stopover in Pernambuco in northern Brazil, he first heard the story about a land rich in precious metals far inland, which could be reached via an enormous estuary further south. The estuary ended up being called the Río de la Plata for its role as the supposed natural gateway to the treasure. The legend captivated Cabot, so he abandoned his mission and decided to find the Sierra de la Plata, assuming that the royal authorities would be indulgent if he found enough silver.\n\nOn Santa Catarina, the castaways Melchor Rodríguez and Enrique Morales confirmed the stories, telling Cabot about Aleixo Garcia's expedition and showing him the metals that had been brought back. Cabot headed toward Río de la Plata, where he disembarked to repair two ships that had been damaged in a storm. There, the expedition met former cabin boy Francisco del Puerto, the sole survivor of Solís's landing party. Del Puerto, who was living with the Guaranís, also verified the legend and offered his services as guide and interpreter.\n\nAfter entering the Río de la Plata, the expedition divided in two: Cabot would continue up the Paraná River and Antón de Grajeda would travel up the Uruguay River. In 1527, at the confluence of the Paraná and Carcarañá Rivers, Cabot established the fort of Sancti Spiritu, the first European settlement in the Río de la Plata basin, and a future base for expeditions to the land of the White King. The party was suffering from hunger and sickness, and since they could not travel by land, they continued north upriver until they landed at an island they named Año Nuevo (\"New Year\"). There, they traded colored glass with the Timbús for food, but Cabot, thinking he had been shortchanged, ordered his men to kill them, burn their homes, and take their food.\n\nIn February 1529, they reached an indigenous town they called Santa Ana, where they were treated hospitably, fed well, and told rumors of other \"white men\" who were coming up the river behind them. Cabot, however, stuck to his plan and continued up the Paraguay River until strong currents prevented him from going further. There, he had a brigantine sent ahead under the command of Miguel de Rifos. Near the confluence of the Pilcomayo River, Rifos decided to disembark with a few men after being welcomed by some indigenous people on the shore. The Europeans headed through the forest to the village, where they were unexpectedly ambushed. Supposedly, it was a trap arranged by the local chief and Del Puerto, who wanted a larger share of the plunder.\n\nThose who had stayed in the brigantine managed to escape, and when they returned to Cabot, he decided to head back to Sancti Spiritu. On the way, he came across Diego García, the \"other white man\" he had been told about. García, like Cabot, had been commissioned to travel to the Moluccas, but had deserted when he heard the tales of the White King. After a brief dispute, the two captains decided to join forces to find the Sierra de la Plata, with Cabot in charge of the unified fleet.\n\nAt Sancti Spiritu, Captain Francisco César was chosen to explore the local region together with another fifteen soldiers. Three months later César returned with half of his men and a rumor that nearby was a great city full of riches that from then on would be known as the Ciudad de los Césares (\"City of the Caesars\").\n\nThe Sebastian Cabot expedition ended in failure when Cabot and Diego García made their next attempt to find the Sierra de la Plata. The local indigenous people took advantage of their absence to attack and destroy Fort Sancti Spiritu, killing many of his men. Low on morale, food, and supplies, Cabot and his crew were finally forced to give up their goal and return to Europe.\n\nIn 1534, King Charles I authorized Pedro de Mendoza to \"conquer and populate the lands and provinces around the Solís River, which some call the Plate\". With fourteen ships and some 1,200 men, it was at the time the largest and most important expedition that had left Europe for America.\n\nIn 1536 Pedro de Mendoza founded the port of Santa María de los Buenos Ayres, which was probably located in what is now the Parque Lezama in Buenos Aires. Resources were in short supply to support such a population, and after the Spaniards mistreated the local Querandís, they stopped supplying food to the settlement. Mendoza decided to send out two fleets in search of food: the first, led by his nephew Gonzalo de Mendoza, headed toward Brazil, and the second, led by Juan de Ayolas, went up the River Paraná with three ships and 270 men. Meanwhile, Mendoza ordered his brother Diego to take 300 soldiers and 30 cavalrymen to fight the Querandís. The battle was a failure. Diego de Mendoza was killed, and the Querandís began a long-lasting siege of Buenos Aires. Cut off from supplies, the settlers began to eat their horses and their dead. Finally, the Querandís withdrew, and in a few days, the Juan de Ayolas expedition returned with the news that they had managed to build a fort called Corpus Christi upriver near the modern-day town of Gaboto and had encountered some indigenous people who talked about the Sierra de la Plata. Pedro de Mendoza decided to travel to the fort with Ayolas and some 400 men.\n\nDuring the voyage, some 200 men died of sickness and hunger, and once they reached Corpus Christi, Mendoza consulted Cabot's map to find that they were still far from their destination. These major setbacks, along with the syphilis he had contracted, convinced Mendoza to return to Europe after a short stop in Buenos Aires.\n\nPedro de Mendoza died on the open sea on June 23, 1537. Juan de Ayolas, who had left Corpus Christi on October 14, 1536 with a fleet of three brigantines and 170 soldiers, inherited his title of \"adelantado\". Meanwhile, Buenos Aires had overcome its famine thanks to provisions Gonzalo de Mendoza brought from Brazil, and was left under the provisional command of Captain Francisco Ruiz Galán, who ordered the first planting of corn with the goal of making the fort self-sustainable.\n\nBefore Pedro de Mendoza left Buenos Aires, having no news of the Ayolas expedition, he sent Juan de Salazar Espinosa upriver in search of him. On August 15, 1537, Espinosa established the fort of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción (today Asunción, Paraguay) at the junction of the rivers Paraguay and Pilcomayo.\n\nMeanwhile, Juan de Ayolas was further up the river Paraguay in Payagua territory, where he met one of Aleixo Garcia's former companions, who told him how difficult the journey had been, due to all the gold and silver that weighed them down. Hearing this story, Ayolas decided to found the port of Candelaria on the spot (close to present-day Corumbá) and commissioned Domingo Martínez de Irala as provisional Lieutenant Governor until he returned from an overland expedition with 130 soldiers. After a short time, with no news of Ayola, Irala decided to abandon his post and return downriver to the fort of Asunción.\n\nHowever, the Juan de Ayolas expedition had successfully reached a mountainous area where precious metals were mined. On his return trip, his party suffered losses from skirmishes with indigenous people, and before he reached the Paraguay River, he ordered his men to bury most of the treasure they carried. When he returned, he was disappointed to find the port of Candelaria abandoned, so he accepted the invitation of the Payaguas to rest in their village. On his way there, a fight broke out between the Spaniards and the local people, and almost the entire expedition was killed, including Juan de Ayolas.\n\nAfter this, Domingo Martínez de Irala became the expedition's new leader, and he took up the goal of conquering the Sierra de la Plata and the lands of the White King. Irala decided to convert Asunción into the headquarters of the conquest, and ordered the colonists at Buenos Aires to tear down their buildings and move to Asunción. However, their newly planted corn was yielding a good crop, and they refused to move. Six months later, Irala disembarked at Buenos Aires to carry out the order. The first settlement at Buenos Aires was finally destroyed and abandoned in 1541.\n\nWhile Irala was preparing his expedition to the Sierra de la Plata, Spain had chosen Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca as the official successor to Pedro de Mendoza's title of \"adelantado\". Known for his long residence among the Indians of modern-day Texas and northern Mexico, Cabeza de Vaca decided to cross Paraguay on foot rather than travel by boat up the Río de la Plata. In October 1541, his expedition left Santa Catalina, crossing jungles, mountains, and rivers to reach Asunción. In January 1542, they passed Iguazú Falls and on March 11, 1542, they reached Asunción, where they met Domingo Martínez de Irala.\n\nCabeza de Vaca clashed with the colonists at Asunción, calling the village a \"Moorish paradise,\" as each colonist had taken multiple indigenous women as wives.\n\nSoon, Cabeza de Vaca began to prepare an expedition to the lands of the White King. First, he sent Irala up the Paraguay River to see if it led to the Sierra de la Plata. He reached La Gaiba Lake in the Pantanal region, where he founded the Puerto de los Reyes. In September 1543, Cabeza de Vaca led his own expedition through the forest, but sickness and clashes with his officers, mostly Irala's men, convinced him to abandon his search and return to Asunción.\n\nWith his authority undermined and disliked by the colonists, the Captain General was soon overthrown. On April 25, 1544, Irala's men entered Cabeza de Vaca's house and took him prisoner. Eleven months later, he was sent to Spain on a ship under the command of Gonzalo de Mendoza. During the voyage, a violent storm broke out, which the superstitious sailors interpreted as divine punishment, so they decided to free all of their prisoners. In Spain, Cabeza de Vaca denounced the colonists' actions to the court, but the case was never resolved, and he never returned to the Americas.\n\nWith his authority confirmed, Domingo Martínez de Irala organized an expedition of 300 Spanish men and 3,000 indigenous men in search of the Sierra de la Plata. After a few battles with indigenous peoples, Irala's men reached a tribe of Macasís, who immediately began speaking to them in Spanish. They told them their lord was Pedro Anzures, and therefore they were out of their jurisdiction. Irala sent a party to speak with the governor of Peru, Pedro de la Gasca, who only ordered the expedition to go no further under pain of death, so they had no choice but to return to Asunción.\n\nIrala organized several other expeditions to legendary locations like the \"Land of Riches\", the \"Lake of El Dorado\", and \"Paititi\". All of these expeditions ended in failure, with great cost in human lives and materials. Meanwhile, the king named Juan de Sanabria as the new \"adelantado\" in the region, but he died during preparations and was replaced by his son Diego, who ended up staying in Europe even though several of his ships had already sailed. Finally, the crown decided to formalize Irala's de facto power, so as Irala was preparing his next expedition, a royal emissary arrived in Asunción, informing Irala that he had been named governor of the Governorate of New Andalusia (also known as the Governorate of the Río de la Plata and Paraguay) with express orders not to lead any more expeditions. With Buenos Aires destroyed and the Sierra de la Plata under another jurisdiction, Paraguay experienced a long period of isolation under Irala, who finally died in October 1556 at the age of 70.\n\nThe Sierra de la Plata legend likely corresponds to the Cerro Rico de Potosí in Bolivia, and the White King to the Inca Huayna Cápac. When Aleixo Garcia explored the region and discovered precious metals in the early 16th century, Spain had barely begun colonizing the coasts of Panama and Colombia, and Portugal had barely begun colonizing the coast of Brazil. Neither of the two crowns knew about the existence of the Inca Empire until Francisco Pizarro encountered it in 1528, traveling from the Pacific coast. King Charles I tried to solve conflicts between conquistadors by dividing South America into several governorates: New Castile, under Francisco Pizarro, which reached from the Santiago River, Ecuador to Pisco, Peru; New Toledo, under Diego de Almagro, from Pisco to Taltal, Chile; and New Andalusia, under Pedro de Mendoza, two hundred leagues south. Of these three, it was Almagro's men who first found the Cerro Rico de Potosí, leaving New Andalusia without any claim to the Sierra de la Plata.\n\n\n"}

A decorated Marine veteran of the Vietnam War, Dye is the founder and head of Warriors, Inc., a technical advisory company specializing in portraying realistic military action in Hollywood films. Dye has also offered his expertise to television, such as the HBO miniseries \"Band of Brothers\" and \"The Pacific\", and video games, including the \"Medal of Honor\" series.\n\nDye was born on October 8, 1944, in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to Dale Adam and Della Grace (née Koehler) Dye. His father was a liquor salesman in and around St. Louis and took Dale with him as he visited working-class taverns. There he heard war stories from World War II veterans. One particular story about man-to-man fighting told by a Marine who said he had fought in the Pacific Theater piqued Dale's attention. He looked up the Battle of Iwo Jima that night and made up his mind to join the U.S. Marines. Dye was educated at St. Joseph's Military Academy in Chicago and the Missouri Military Academy in Mexico, Missouri.\n\nDye had hoped to attend the U.S. Naval Academy, but after failing the entrance exam three times – \"my math and science skills were weak, and my English skills were huge\" – and having exhausted his family's meager funds getting through military academy, he enlisted in the U.S. Marines in January 1964. His unit was among the first to deploy to Vietnam in 1965. Officers in the unit noticed his keen observational skills and literary interest and encouraged him to reclassify as a combat correspondent. He became one of a very few Marine combat correspondents. He sent stories to military publications and to the home town newspapers of fellow Marines. As a correspondent, he saw more battles than many low-ranking infantrymen. Dye developed an immense respect for the grunts who took the brunt of any action.\n\nDye was wounded during the Tet Offensive in 1968. While recuperating in a rear area, the 2nd Battalion 3rd Marines, the unit he had traveled with, was preparing for Operation Ford. Dye persuaded the battalion commander to let him accompany the battalion as a war correspondent. During the next week, the battalion engaged in a number of fire fights with units of the North Vietnamese People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN). On March 18, 1968, Dye replaced an assistant machine gunner who had been killed. The machine gun position was isolated forward of the remainder of the battalion. Although he was wounded, Dye exposed himself to \"intense enemy fire\" to retrieve ammunition for the machine gun to help hold off PAVN soldiers during an all-night firefight. During other engagements, he exposed himself to enemy fire to rescue several wounded Marines and a Navy corpsman. As a result of his actions, he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Combat \"V\" for heroism.\n\n\"Dye's heart is with the grunts,\" says Bob Rea, who worked with Dye as a combat correspondent during the worst of Tet. \"He feels like he owes something to those people. He is a grunt wannabe.\" During three tours of duty in South Vietnam, he participated in 31 combat operations. During his 1967 to 1968 and 1969 to 1970 tours of duty, he was attached to two different battalions of the 1st Marine Division. Dye spent a total of 13 years as an enlisted Marine, rising to the rank of Master Sergeant before being appointed a warrant officer in 1976. Afterwards he entered into the Limited Duty Program and became commissioned as a captain. He is considered a \"mustang\" (an enlisted man who receives a commission as an officer). While he was a captain, he was deployed to Beirut for duty with the Multinational Force in Lebanon in 1982 and 1983. Shortly after his return, the Marine barracks were attacked, killing 241 Americans.\n\nFellow Marine correspondent Gustav Hasford dubbed him \"Daddy D.A.\" (as he was among the oldest of the correspondents) and included him as a character in his first semi-autobiographical Vietnam novel, \"The Short-Timers\", and more extensively in his second, \"The Phantom Blooper\". The movie based on Hasford's first novel, \"Full Metal Jacket\", included the \"Daddy D.A\" character (played by Keith Hodiak), though neither the character nor Dye's name is explicitly mentioned in the dialogue.\n\nIn his book \"Dispatches\", journalist Michael Herr provides a vivid picture of Dye during the chaos of the Tet Offensive and the Battle of Huế:\n\nDye retired from the Marine Corps in 1984 and founded Warriors, Inc. The company specializes in training actors in war films to portray their roles realistically and provides research, planning, staging, and on-set consultation for directors and other film production personnel. His company is the top military consultant to Hollywood. While on active duty, Dye was a combat correspondent and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the University of Maryland University College. After retiring, Dye became a correspondent for Soldier of Fortune Magazine. He worked for the magazine for one year during which he worked in Central America, providing guerrilla warfare training to troops in El Salvador and Nicaragua while reporting on conflicts in the region.\n\nDye has written several novels, including \"Run Between The Raindrops\" in 1985 (also published as \"Citadel\") and \"Conduct Unbecoming\" (1992), and the novelization of the film \"Platoon\". Along with wife Julia and comic book artist Gerry Kissell, Dye created the critically acclaimed and best-selling graphic novel \"Code Word: Geronimo\" (IDW Publishing, 2011), which tells the story of the Navy SEAL raid on Osama bin Laden's compound.\n\nDye was determined to make Hollywood's depictions of battle more realistic. After unsuccessfully offering his services to a number of directors, he pitched fellow Vietnam War veteran Oliver Stone a plan to put actors through a mock boot camp before production of the movie \"Platoon\". Dye put the principal actors—including Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe, Johnny Depp and Forest Whitaker—through an immersive 30-day military-style training regimen. He limited how much food and water they received; when the actors slept, he fired blanks to keep the tired actors awake. Dye, who had a small role in the movie as Captain Harris, also wrote the novelization based on Stone's screenplay. After \"Platoon\"s critical success, Dye played a role in another Vietnam War movie, \"Casualties of War\", and also played Colonel Robert Sink in the HBO miniseries \"Band of Brothers\", on which his company also worked. Dye also worked as a military technical adviser on the HBO companion piece to \"Band of Brothers\", the ten-part mini-series \"The Pacific\", which was shot in Australia.\n\nDye appeared in \"Outbreak\" portraying Lieutenant Colonel Briggs, a U.S. Army officer. He played Theodore Roosevelt's superior officer, Colonel Leonard Wood, in the TNT miniseries \"Rough Riders\". He appeared in \"Saving Private Ryan\" as an aide to General George Marshall; in \"Under Siege\" and \"\" as Captain Garza, an admiral's aide; in \"Spy Game\" as Commander Wiley during the rescue sequence; in \"Mission Impossible\" as Frank Barnes of the CIA; in \"JFK\" as General Y; and in \"Starship Troopers\" as a high-ranking officer in the aftermath of the Brain Bug capture. Dye played himself in \"Entourage\", teaching Vince to scuba-dive in preparation for his role in \"Aquaman\". He appeared in the 2011 Tom Hanks film \"Larry Crowne\". He was the technical adviser for the 1994 Oliver Stone movie \"Natural Born Killers\", making a brief appearance as a fictionalized, police-lieutenant version of himself. Dye played Col. Porter in the TNT science fiction series \"Falling Skies\" from 2011 to 2013. he was preparing to direct two films, \"No Better Place to Die\", which he wrote, and \"Citizen Soldiers\".\n\nDuring the Iraq War, Dye was hired as a military commentator by radio station KFI AM 640 in Los Angeles and given a two-hour radio show. He hosted the History Channel's documentary series \"The Conquerors\". Dye consulted during development of the \"Medal of Honor\" video games series. He was featured in two tracks on Hoobastank's CD \"Every Man for Himself\". Dye voiced Colonel Robert Sink in the \"Brothers in Arms\" video game series. Dye had a cameo appearance as New Founding Father Donald Talbott in the 2014 film \"\".\n\n\nDye's military decorations and awards include:\n\n\n"}

Michael Straczynski, who participated in a number of Internet venues to discuss elements of his work with his fans, including the rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5 Usenet newsgroup, where he continued to communicate as late as March 2007. This flow of information and feedback had a substantial impact on \"Babylon 5\", as well as Straczynski's other shows and his fan base. This interaction pre-dated the coining of the term \"blog\", but is functionally similar.\n\n\"Babylon 5\" was one of the first shows to employ Internet marketing to create publicity among online readers far in advance of the airing of the pilot episode. Straczynski participated in online communities on Usenet (in the rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated newsgroup), and the GEnie and Compuserve systems before the web came together as it exists today. Straczynski had long participated in many online forums since the 1980s, and is widely credited as being the first notable artist and celebrity to interact with fans online, even before the advent of the world wide web.\n\nThis free interaction with his fans was not without its problems. A third-season episode (\"Passing Through Gethsemane\") was originally developed a year earlier in 1994 but had to be \"scuttled\" because a fan posted a story idea on GEnie that matched the plot of the episode. The story was not put back into the production pipeline until Straczynski could obtain a signed legal release from the fan. The moderated Usenet group was created as a consequence, specifically to filter out story ideas. Straczynski also asked fans not to engage in fan-fiction while the show was in production, and most fans complied with this request.\n\nOn rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated, Straczynski regularly discussed with fans the process of creating and producing the show, the meaning of the work, and the development of the plot. He confirmed or denied fan theories and interpretations of the show, and answered questions – though often cryptically. In November 1995, Straczynski temporarily left the newsgroup due to an increasing number of flames, but returned in December when a process was put in place to filter the threads that reached him.\n\n\"Babylon 5\" also inspired a number of fan sites. One of the first was \"The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5\". It was noticed by \"The Washington Post\" and acknowledged by Straczynski in a Season 5 DVD commentary. Its root URL at the time, Hyperion, was used on the show as the name of a heavy cruiser. It also received early news from the show's copyright holders.\n\nIn 1995, Warner Bros. started the Official Babylon 5 web site which was hosted on the now defunct Pathfinder portal. In September 1995 they hired a fan, Troy Rutter, to take over the site and move it not only to its own domain name at www.babylon5.com, but also to oversee the \"Keyword B5\" area on America Online. The fans continued to play an important role in the development of the series and the online support campaign is credited with helping persuade former PTEN station owners to carry the fourth season of the show in 1996.\n\nOver the course of the series, Warner Bros. encouraged the use of pictures and images on fan web sites, and eventually created a home-page community called AcmeCity where users could create a homepage using logos and graphics without fear of lawsuits. Also during this time, Warner Bros. executive Jim Moloshok created and distributed electronic trading cards to help advertise the series.\n\nA contest was conducted in conjunction with Sound Source Interactive called the \"Mystery Alien Sweepstakes,\" with the grand-prize to portray an alien on the show.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Viking Airlines primarily operated charter flights for European tour operators. The airline was established in 2003. Viking Airlines had its head office in Spånga, Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nViking Airlines ceased operations on 18 October 2010 and was granted protection from creditors and placed in the hands of an administrator on 2 December 2010. The company was formally declared bankrupt in February 2011.\n\nViking Airlines started operations on 5 May 2003, with two McDonnell Douglas MD-83 which were used for charter operations throughout Europe. In 2004 another MD-83 was added to the fleet and by 2006 it was operating four MD-83s. Three aircraft were sold in 2008 leaving a single McDonnell Douglas MD-83 aircraft being operated in 2008, which was supplemented with aircraft from Sky Wings to meet seasonal demand.\n\nIn December 2008 Viking Airlines took delivery of one Boeing 737-800, which entered service from a new base at London Gatwick Airport, UK on 19 December 2008. Viking Airlines also took delivery of 5 more Boeing 737-800's and 3 Boeing 737-300's in April 2009. Some aircraft were leased from Sunwing Airlines. Viking also opened bases at Manchester and Bristol Airport where it launched new flights to holiday destinations in Greece, Bulgaria, Egypt, the Canary Islands, France and Italy. Another base was also opened in Glasgow later in the year, with new flights to the Mediterranean.\n\nFrom December 2008 through to October 2010 Viking Airlines operated regular flights to Iraq, serving Erbil, Baghdad and Sulaymaniyah from London Gatwick Airport connecting in Sweden before continuing on to their destination in Iraq. Gatwick based Cabin Crew would operate these flights. The services into Iraq were operated via Sweden in conjunction with sanctions at the time preventing aircraft from the United Kingdom flying into the war torn country, for a short time during that period flights were stopped due to a report of a Swedish aircraft being shot at during take off from Sulaymaniyah International Airport, however restrictions were lifted and flights resumed, life insurance policies were granted to the Cabin Crew and Flight Crew operating these flights due to the high risk zone in which the aircraft were flying into, they were also only able to operate services into the country during the night and had to ensure that all aircraft lights were switched off inside and out to make the aircraft less visible during approach.\n\nOn 16 July 2010, Goldtrail, the UK's leading tour operator for packaged holidays to Turkey and Greece collapsed leaving an estimated 16,000 customers stranded overseas. Viking Airlines was one of the three charter airlines that operated flights for Goldtrail.\n\nOn 17 August 2010, the airline stated that, as a consequence of Flight Options' going into administration, it was to cut three aircraft \"immediately\" from its fleet. On 15 October 2010, Viking suspended operations for the winter season, returning all remaining aircraft to their lessors. On 17 August 2010, Kiss Flights went into liquidation. Viking cut their fleet back to 6 aircraft because Viking was also an airline that operated for Kiss. Viking's fleet was further reduced to 2 during September/October 2010.\n\nOn 15 October 2010, Viking confirmed that the remaining aircraft had been handed back to the lessors. On the 19 October 2010, all operational staff employed by Viking Airlines AB in the United Kingdom by the wholly owned subsidiary Viking VIP Limited received a letter of Termination of Contract from the Director of Flight Operations, Bo-Göran Svensson.

{"id": "1921594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921594", "title": "Ken Uston", "text": "Ken Uston\n\nKen Uston (January 12, 1935 – September 19, 1987) was an American blackjack player, strategist and author, credited with popularizing the concept of team play at blackjack. During the early to mid-1970s he gained widespread notoriety for perfecting techniques to do team card counting in numerous casinos worldwide, earning millions of dollars from the casinos, with some bets as high as $12,000 on a single hand.\n\nHe was banned from casinos around the world and would adopt various costumes in order to conceal his identity and still be able to play. He filed a high-profile lawsuit against these casinos and successfully received a ruling from the New Jersey courts that absent a valid New Jersey Casino Commission regulation excluding card counters, casinos could not ban someone simply for counting cards at blackjack. In response, many casinos changed their systems, increasing the number of decks in games or changing rules to increase the house edge.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Uston also authored several popular books on video games and personal computers. He was the subject of a 1981 segment on \"60 Minutes\" and in 2005, he was the subject of the History Channel documentary, \"The Blackjack Man\".\n\nUston was born Kenneth Senzo Usui in New York City, the oldest of three children born to Elsie Lubitz, a native of Austria and Senzo Usui, a Japanese immigrant and businessman. At the age of 16, Uston was accepted to and henceforth began attending Yale University, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Shortly after graduating from Yale, he went on to earn an MBA from Harvard University. He became district manager of the Southern New England Telephone Co., then a senior management consultant with Cresap, McCormick & Paget in San Francisco, where he relocated with his wife and two daughters. After several years in consulting, he became corporate planning manager for American Cement in Los Angeles before returning to San Francisco where he became a Senior Vice-President at the Pacific Stock Exchange. On weekends, beginning in his years at Cresap, he read Thorp's \"Beat the Dealer\" and began to spend time in the casinos, becoming what the Cleveland \"Plain Dealer\" called \"a genius card-counter\". Uston was also a talented musician, proficient on the bass as well as the piano. He was frequently asked to play in several San Francisco jazz clubs.\n\nIn a 1983 \"Blackjack Forum\" interview, Uston related that he became fascinated by blackjack and its inherent strategies after meeting professional gambler Al Francesco in a poker game. Francesco had recently launched the first \"big player\" type of blackjack card counting team, and he recruited Uston to be one of his main team players. Their system was that members of the team would play at different tables around a casino, counting cards. When a count became extremely positive, they would flag the \"big player\" member of the team who would come in and place large bets. This technique would prevent the increased bet spread from being noticed by the pit bosses. On his first five-day run, the team won $44,100, of which Uston's share was $2,100. After two months of being a counter, Uston was promoted to \"Big Player\".\n\nAlthough Al Francesco and other team members have recounted in subsequent \"Blackjack Forum\" interviews that Uston made very little money for \"their\" team, Uston co-authored with Roger Rapoport a book entitled \"The Big Player\" in which he shared credit for many of his card-counting successes with his fellow team members, including noted Blackjack master-strategist Bill Erb. Soon after the publication of Uston's book, it is reported that Al Francesco's team found itself effectively barred from playing in Las Vegas.\n\nIn 1978, the year legal gambling began in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Uston moved to the area and formed a profitable blackjack team of his own (discussed at length in a 2005 \"Blackjack Forum\" interview with team member Darryl Purpose). As with most other casinos around the globe, Uston was soon barred from playing at those locations within Atlantic City as well. After he was barred in January 1979 by Resorts International, he filed a lawsuit, claiming that casinos did not have the right to bar skilled players. In \"Uston v. Resorts International Hotel Inc.\", 445 A.2d 370 (N.J. 1982), the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that Atlantic City casinos did not have the authority to decide whether card counters could be barred absent a valid New Jersey Casino Commission regulation excluding card counters. To date, New Jersey casinos—by statute—are not allowed to bar them. In response to Uston's legal victory, Atlantic City casinos began adding decks, moving up shuffle points, and taking other measures to decrease a skilled player's potential advantage.\n\nAfter his numerous casino barrings—now on his own and without a team—Uston adopted a wide variety of physical disguises in order to continue to play blackjack. He was also known for his aggressive approach along with his flamboyant playing style. In an article in \"Blackjack Forum\", Arnold Snyder describes playing with Ken Uston at Circus Circus Las Vegas near the end of Uston's life. He states that Uston was disguised as a worker from Hoover Dam and got away with spreading his bets from \"table minimum\" to \"table maximum\" on a single-deck game. Since this took place at a time when card counting was well understood by casino executives and managers, and since the primary clue by which casinos detect card counting is a card counter's \"bet spread\" pattern, most card counters would also consider Uston a genius of disguise, and/or \"card counting camouflage\".\n\nAfter \"The Big Player\", Uston went on to write \"Million Dollar Blackjack\". This book includes details about professional gamblers' techniques for gaining an advantage at the game. Uston also authored a companion piece, \"Ken Uston on Blackjack\".\n\nIn an interview published in \"Video Games\", Uston revealed he got hooked on the games \"Pong\" and then \"Breakout\". In 1979 \"Space Invaders\" became his video game of choice and, after his blackjack team made $350,000 in Atlantic City, they rented a house in California and bought a \"Space Invaders\" machine. The game appealed to him in part because of the trick of counting one's shots to get the maximum number of points for the spaceship at the top of the screen.\n\nIn 1981, Uston began frequenting the Easy Street Pub near the Playboy Casino in Atlantic City. It was there he began a competition with some other regulars for having the high score on the bar's \"Pac-Man\" arcade game. He realized the game had patterns and, in order to gain an advantage, he began experimenting and writing them down on diagrams of the maze he had created, but he was unable to go beyond a certain level. On a trip back to San Francisco, he came across two Chinese-American boys by the names of \"Tommy\" and \"Raymond\" who taught him how to go further in the game. People had been telling Uston he should write a book about \"Pac-Man\", but he had felt he didn't have enough knowledge. After receiving lessons from the two boys, Uston decided to go ahead with the book, titled \"Mastering Pac-Man\", and wrote it in four days. It went on to appear in the New York Times Best Seller list.\n\nUston went on to write several more books about video games and home computers during the 1980s. He also licensed his name to Coleco for the ColecoVision game, \"Ken Uston's Blackjack/Poker\". In 1983, Screenplay published software titled for the Apple II series, Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 64, and IBM PC to assist in the learning and practice of Uston's relatively complex, yet highly accurate card-counting techniques.\n\nHe was also credited with the idea for the 1984 game \"Puzzle Panic\".\n\nOn the morning of September 19, 1987, Ken Uston, age 52, was found dead in his rented apartment in Paris. The cause of death was listed as heart failure.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1921596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921596", "title": "Granholm v. Heald", "text": "Granholm v. Heald\n\nGranholm v. Heald, 544 U.S. 460 (2005), was a court case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in a 5–4 decision that ruled that laws in New York and Michigan that permitted in-state wineries to ship wine directly to consumers, but prohibited out-of-state wineries from doing the same, were unconstitutional. The case was unusual because the arguments centered on the rarely invoked 21st Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1933, which ended Prohibition in the United States.\n\n\"Granholm v. Heald\" was the conclusion of an eight-year fight by small wineries against these laws. Although direct shipments to consumers constituted only about 2% of wine sales in the United States (whose total sales were $21.6 billion in 2003), direct sales were thought to be an opportunity for growth. Laws varied from state to state, but typically a winery could distribute wine only by selling it to a wholesaler in the state. Retailers were then required to purchase from the wholesalers. This made the large wholesalers very powerful in the wine industry; if wholesalers in New York decided not to purchase wine from a particular winery, then that winery would be completely shut out of the New York market.\n\nThe court case, which was a consolidation of two separate lawsuits, pitted the Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine, inferred from the Constitution's Article I, against Section Two of the 21st Amendment. \nSection Two of the 21st Amendment reads:\nThe Commerce Clause of Article One of the Constitution grants Congress the power:\n\nIn turn, the Dormant Commerce Clause (or \"DCC\") has been inferred from the Commerce Clause. The DCC is a doctrine, evolved over many decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, that the states do not have the power to enact anticompetitive laws that discriminate against sellers in other states without the permission of Congress.\n\nEleanor Heald, a wine collector, and eleven other plaintiffs, argued that Michigan's Liquor Control Code violated the DCC by making it a misdemeanor for an out-of-state winery to ship wine directly to a Michigan resident while not prohibiting direct shipping by in-state wineries. The same argument was made in a separate case against the government of the state of New York by Juanita Swedenburg and other owners of out-of-state wineries.\n\nIn these two cases, the state governments of Michigan and New York had argued that Section 2 of the 21st Amendment granted them \"carte blanche\" to regulate liquor. One of their justifications for the laws was that by regulating out-of-state wineries in this way, they might be able to hinder the shipment of alcohol to underage minors; this would serve a valid state purpose.\n\nThe government of New York had won in the federal Second Circuit Court, and the government of Michigan had lost in the Sixth Circuit. The cases were consolidated and heard together by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court decided the states' laws were unconstitutional. The context of the 21st Amendment, they wrote, was to return to the \"status quo\" that existed before Prohibition, making it clear that the states had the power to regulate alcohol however they wished, including banning alcoholic beverages entirely within the state if desired. Before Prohibition, the states did not have the power to violate the Dormant Commerce Clause, and the 21st Amendment was not intended to grant them this power.\n\nMichigan's liquor control board announced it would recommend to the state government that it ban \"all\" direct wine sales to consumers, joining the 15 other states currently banning all such sales.\n\nNew York governor George Pataki unveiled a bill that would limit each winery's direct sales to consumers to two cases per month per consumer. As a \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial noted, two cases per month is a relatively large amount of wine for a consumer, but the measure was intended to reduce competition for New York alcohol distributors. New York State enacted a bill in 2006 that allows direct shipment of wine to consumers on a reciprocal basis; New York residents can purchase wine shipped from a state that grant New York wineries the same rights.\n\nSince the ruling, many more states have allowed direct shipping from wineries. According to the Wine Institute (a public policy advocacy association of California wineries) 37 states permit at least some form of direct shipping from wineries to consumers (as of July 2010). Different states have enacted different regulations. An editorial article on the commercial wine selling web site \"Appelation America\" says that many of the conditions in these regulations are either so complex or so expensive as to discourage wineries from complying.\n\nIn March 2011, a bill was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that would explicitly allow states to regulate alcohol products from outside of the state differently from those produced within the state.\n\n\n"}

The program ran from 1985 to 1994.\n\nThe block premiered on Sunday, September 15, 1985 and included an array of both old and new Hanna-Barbera original cartoon shows. The show aired on Sundays in most markets, but some stations broadcast it on Saturdays. The 1985 to 1987 edition was hosted by legendary Hanna-Barbera mainstays, Yogi Bear, Quick Draw McGraw, Huckleberry Hound and Snagglepuss (all voiced by Daws Butler). \n\nEach show included HBTV segments featuring music videos of classic Hanna-Barbera cartoon clips (similar to Disney's \"D-TV\" and Nickelodeon's sister network MTV). It included hits like \"Bad Moon Rising\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival and \"Somebody's Watching Me\" by Rockwell. \"\"It's Fun! Fun! Fun!

Houston's performance of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Super Bowl XXV, and 1988 Olympics tribute \"One Moment in Time\" are also included in the set. The collection includes four new songs—\"Could I Have This Kiss Forever\", duet with Enrique Iglesias, \"If I Told You That\", duet with George Michael, \"Same Script, Different Cast\", duet with Deborah Cox and \"Fine\"—all of which were released as singles. It also includes three other songs that had never appeared on a Houston album: \"One Moment in Time\", \"The Star Spangled Banner\", and \"If You Say My Eyes Are Beautiful\", a duet with Jermaine Jackson from his 1986 \"Precious Moments\" album. Along with the album, an accompanying VHS and DVD was released featuring the music videos to Houston's greatest hits, as well as several hard-to-find live performances including her 1983 debut on \"The Merv Griffin Show\", and interviews.\n\nHouston's compilation album had been in development for several years prior to its release. As early as 1995, Billboard Magazine listed Houston's Greatest Hits album as an upcoming release scheduled for October of that year. Billboard magazine mentioned a \"long-promised\" Greatest Hits collection again in July 1996, this time due that autumn. Speculation on the timing of the release continued into 1997, with Houston quoted that year as saying: \"Oh, Clive is on my case about this greatest hits album. He's like, Whitney, we have to do a greatest hits album, I mean you're far long overdue.\"\n\nUpon its release \"Whitney: The Greatest Hits\" was a commercial success, but it received mixed reviews from music critics. Many complained about the inclusion of remixes on disc two, instead of their original versions. It peaked within top ten in most European countries, United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and received numerous platinum and multiplatinum awards. However, the album's commercial performance was considerably stronger outside the United States. Unlike prior Houston albums where typically one album is sold internationally for every album sold in the U.S., for The Greatest Hits the ratio was four to one in favor of international sales. Domestic sales, while respectable, may have lagged Arista's expectations; in the summer of 2000, Arista President L.A. Reid reportedly had a terse meeting with top executives, a few weeks after his appointment into the role, to discuss the \"uncharacteristically meager sales\" of \"Whitney: The Greatest Hits.\"\n\nAfter Houston's passing in February 2012, it saw resurgence in sales and re-entered album charts in many countries in Europe and in North America. In the United States, it reached a new peak of number two on the \"Billboard\" 200. In July 2012, it was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales exceeding 2.5 million in the United States, because it's a double disc album, its CDs are therefore counted separately for certification purposes, meaning the album achieved platinum status in the United States after 500,000 copies were shipped, not one million. In Europe, the IFPI certified the album three times platinum in 2000 for sales exceeding 3 million copies across Europe.\n\nIn the United States, copies sold at Circuit City stores included a third disc containing new club remixes. \"Whitney: The Unreleased Mixes\" is a limited-edition four-record vinyl set, containing eight full club versions of selected remixes found on the American release. In June 2006, it was released digitally and re-titled \"Dance Vault Mixes: Whitney Houston – The Unreleased Mixes (Collector's Edition)\". In January 2011, the album was re-issued in Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand with the international track listing, but the set was re-titled as \"The Essential Whitney Houston\", as part of Sony Legacy's \"The Essential\" series. In addition to the title change, the re-release also features different artwork. The cover picture of the original release was taken by David LaChapelle.\n\nFollowing the release of her \"Greatest Hits\" album, Houston promoted it by performing three sold-out shows at Caesars in Atlantic City from June 30 to July 3, 2000. She performed an additional date during the fall on November 10, at the Aladdin Theatre in Las Vegas, with husband at that time, Bobby Brown opening the show. Brown performed a few of his hit songs, both performers closed the show singing their hit duet, \"Something in Common\".\n\nSet list\n\nShows\nUpon its release, \"Whitney: The Greatest Hits\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics. CANOE reviewer Jane Stevenson felt that it is \"a greatest hits package that makes good listening sense.\" Steve Huey from AllMusic showed his dissatisfaction with Arista's choice for the accompanying second disc included their remix instead of the original version, stating \"the Greatest Hits disc amply reinforces once again what a fine singles artist Houston has been for the entirety of her career. Still and all, though, it's a frustrating package marred by record company greed.\" Unlike Huey, Jim Farber of \"New York Daily News\" rated the second disc more highly than the first which \"recycles Houston's boring old ballads.\" He commented: \"In her dance mixes, she exudes an erotic dynamism that no one else has the lung power to match. This album['s second disc] isn't just an ecstatic piece of party music ― it utterly redefines Houston as an artist.\" \"Newsweek\"s Allison Samuels wrote \"No one of her generation sings with more character and conviction\", giving the album four stars out of five. Ken Tucker from \"Entertainment Weekly\" commented harshly on the album: \"To listen to the two discs is to hear the sound of a gift being squandered\", advising her \"Continually pursuing mega record sales at the expense of invention, Houston needs to exhale — to loosen up and put more shoop-shoop R&B into her creative life.\"\n\nA reviewer from \"The Guardian\" commented that \"[disc two] is eminently more listenable. The likes of I Will Always Love You and Greatest Love of All weren't just a waste of one of the potentially great soul voices; they opened the door for Celine Dion. But Houston remembers her gospel and R&B roots often enough to counterbalance the slush with rootsier offerings like I'm Your Baby Tonight and It's Not Right But It's Okay. New duets with George Michael and (especially titanically) Enrique Iglesias complete a couple of hours of diva-style fun.\" Steve Jones form \"USA Today\" rated the album four stars out of four, commenting that \"\"Whitney: The Greatest Hits\" [...] puts its subject in context by smartly arranging the material so it's easy to follow Whitney Houston's 15 year progression from ingenue to mature singer. [...] The set does its job well, encapsulating a career that's still a work in progress.\" \"Billboard\" called it \"quite [a] stellar collection\", adding that \"timing couldn't be better for this [...] career retrospective.\" In contrast, according to \"NME\" \"[t]he timing couldn't be worse. Issuing a double CD of Whitney Houston's finest moments was intended to shore up her rapidly eroding soul diva supremacy against the rising tide of clued-up, modern successors to her throne – Missy Elliott, Lauryn Hill, Kelis.\" It rated the collection, however, five stars out of five.\n\n\"LA Weekly\" reviewed the collection negatively, stating that \"it's damn near unlistenable. The first of the two discs is the \"Cool Down\" side, i.e., the ballads. One track slides too smoothly into the next, with Whitney's voice — so strong, so assured, so boring — anchoring saccharine production and even sappier songwriting. [...] The 'Throw Down' disc is filled with astonishingly bad dance remixes of old hits[.]\" According to \"Ebony\", \"\"Whitney: The Greatest Hits\" reminds listeners of the enormous talent this artist demonstrated on \"You Give Good Love\" 15 years ago, how she has grown, and the fact she has a long career road ahead.\" Sonia Murray from \"Atlanta Journal and Constitution\" graded the album B+, commenting that \"What makes Whitney Houston's first collection of hits great is her. Not the songs. [...] On the first CD there's her masterfully manipulated big pop confections (\"I Will Always Love You\"), the occasional, really soulful R&B tunes (\"Saving All My Love for You\") and new radio-ready duets with Whitney-in-training Deborah Cox and Latin smolderer Enrique Iglesias. The second CD of dance remixes is an appropriate nod to an artist who has held sway over so many genres. But without a gospel single from \"The Preacher's Wife\" soundtrack --- some of her most emotive work --- this isn't Whitney at her best.\" AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that \"\"The Essential Whitney Houston\" plays much like \"The Greatest Hits\"; even if it has a handful of songs not on the 2000 collection, it covers the same territory equally well and equally entertainingly.\" \"The Orlando Sentinel\" wrote that the \"double album contains almost all of her hit singles from the past 15 years\".\n\nIn February 2012, following Houston's death, the album re-entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at number 6 with 64,000 copies sold. It sold 886,000 copies in 2012; all but 2,500 were sold after her death. The album had previously sold 1,738,000 copies prior to 2012.\n\nIn Canada, the album jumped up to number 3 with 7,800 copies sold. On February 29, Houston became the first woman to place three albums in the top 10 of the \"Billboard\" 200 chart at the same time (\"Whitney: the Greatest Hits\" at #2, \"The Bodyguard\" at #6 and \"Whitney Houston\" at #9). On March 7, 2012, Houston set two \"Billboard\" chart records; she became the second female artist after Adele to place two albums in the top five of the \"Billboard\" 200 with \"Whitney: The Greatest Hits\" at #2 and \"The Bodyguard\" at #5, and the first female to place nine albums within the top 100(with \"Whitney: The Greatest Hits\" at #2, \"The Bodyguard\" at #5, \"Whitney Houston\" at #10, \"I Look to You\" at #13, \"Triple Feature\" at #21, \"My Love Is Your Love\" at #31, \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" at #32, \"Just Whitney\" at #50 and \"\" at #80).\n\nAccording to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), \"Whitney: The Greatest Hits\" was the 32nd global best-selling album of 2012 with sales of one million copies.\n\nAdapted from AllMusic.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is the 2004 Olympic silver medalist in all-around, a two-time (2003, 2005) World all-around bronze medalist, the 2004 European all-around bronze medalist and 2000 Grand Prix Final all-around silver medalist.\n\nTchachina was born to a Russian family as the eldest of three children. She has a younger brother and sister.\nIn late 2011, Tchachina married Russian businessman Evgeny Arkhipov.\n\nTchachina was a technical gymnast, known for her expressive hands, high and big leaps, her switch leap with changing legs (almost similar to a Butterfly twist leap) was her signature leap. She has also executed reverse illusion turns.\n\nTchachina began training at the age of six in her hometown of Omsk (also the hometown of Galima Shugurova, Evgenia Kanaeva, Tatiana Druchinina, Ksenia Dudkina, Sofya Skomorokh). After she became impressed watching the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships on television, her grandfather, a devoted amateur sportsman, took her to a sports school. Her early days were filled with music lessons, swimming and rhythmic gymnastics. Faced with a choice at age 11, she chose gymnastics. She was coached by Vera Shtelbaums and her daughter Elena Arais since the age of five. Her favourite gymnasts are Olena Vitrychenko and Yanina Batyrchina.\n\nTchachina's first victory was at age eight at the Omskaya oblast championship. By age 12 she was a member of Russia's national team and routinely travelled to Moscow to take part in training camps. As a junior, she placed first at the CIS Spatakiada, and won the Russian women's championships twice in a row.\n\nIn August 1999, Tchachina began training at the Olympic Preparatory School under the guidance of Irina Viner, and around the same time she won the World Championships in Osaka, Japan. In 2001, she won the gold in the hoop and silver in the individual all-around, ball, clubs and rope at the 2001 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships in Madrid, Spain, but Tchachina and her teammate Alina Kabaeva tested positive for a banned diuretic and were stripped of their medals. Irina Viner, the Russian head coach, who also served as the Vice President of the FIG Rhythmic Gymnastics Technical Committee at the time, said her gymnasts had been taking a food supplement called \"Hyper\" containing mild diuretics, which, according to Viner, the gymnasts were taking for pre-menstrual syndrome. When the supply ran out shortly before the Goodwill Games, the team physiotherapist restocked at a local pharmacy. According to Viner, the supplement sold there was fake and contained furosemide. The commission requested the Goodwill Games organizing committee nullify Kabaeva and Tchachina's results.\n\nIn 2003, Tchachina sustained an ankle injury, and dealt with it for two years. The same year she and Kabaeva made their return to competitive gymnastics following their ban. Tchachina won the all-around bronze medal at the 2003 World Championships, silver in clubs and bronze in hoop event finals.\n\nIn 2004, Tchachina won the all-around bronze medal at the 2004 European Championships behind Ukraine's Anna Bessonova. At the 2004 Athens Olympics, Tchachina won the silver medal in the all-around competition, scoring 107.325 points (Hoop 27.100, Ball 27.100, Clubs 26.825, Ribbon 26.300) – her teammate Alina Kabaeva took the gold with a score of 108.400.\n\nAfter the Olympic season, Tchachina experienced a recurring ankle injury. Although no longer in top form, she was still able to win the bronze medal in all-around at the 2005 World Championships and a pair of bronze medals in clubs and rope finals. She retired from rhythmic gymnastics in early 2006.\n\nAfter her retirement, Tchachina was invited to the Russian television project \"Dances on Ice\", partnering with Olympic bronze medalist ice dancer Ruslan Goncharov. She also appeared on the project \"Circus with stars\" along with other athletes, including Svetlana Khorkina. Tchachina then starred as the lead heroine in the Russian film \"The Way\" (2009 film) with Artem Mikhalkov. Tchachina wrote an autobiography titled \"Irina Tchachina: Being Yourself\". Commenting on her sport, she said: \"Besides your body, you should train your mind too. Intelligence is crucial to rhythmic gymnastics.\"\n\nOn 4 December 2012 at the conference of the Russian Federation of Rhythmic Gymnastics in Novogorsk, Tchachina was elected vice-president of The Russian Rhythmic Gymnastics Federation (RRGF) along with 2008 and 2012 Olympic champion Evgenia Kanaeva. Tchachina was recommended by Irina Viner for the position of President of the Russian Rhythmic Gymnastics Federation (RRGF) but she declined.\n\nOn May 2013, Tchachina opened up her rhythmic gymnastics school named after her in Barnaul, Altai Krai. The Opening Ceremony was attended by other rhythmic gymnasts Liubov Charkashyna, Natalia Godunko and Olga Kapranova.\n\nOn February 15, 2015, a star-studded gala was held in Russia for the 80th founding anniversary of Rhythmic Gymnastics. The venue was held in the historical Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. Among those who performed at the gala were Russian former Olympic champions, Olympic medalists and World champions including: Tchachina, Evgenia Kanaeva, Yulia Barsukova, Daria Dmitrieva, and Yana Batyrshina.\n\n"}

Its members were known as \"Maraisards\", or derogatory \"Toads\" () as toads live in marshes. They sat between the Girondists' right-wing and Montagnards' left-wing. None of these three groups was an organized party as is known today. The Mountain and the Girondists did consist of individuals with similar views and agendas who socialized together and often coordinated political plans. However, The Plain consisted of delegates that did not belong to either of these two groups and as such was even more amorphous. The Plain constituted the majority of delegates to the Convention and would vote with either the Girondists or Mountain depending on the issue at hand, the current circumstances and mood of the Convention. They initially sided with the Girondists, but later backed the Mountain in executing Louis XVI and inaugurating the Terror. They later abandoned the Mountain, inaugurating the Thermidorian Reaction.\n\n"}

With Maya Usova, he is a two-time Olympic medalist (1994 silver, 1992 bronze), the 1993 World champion, and the 1993 European champion. They also won gold medals at Skate America, NHK Trophy, Nations Cup, and Winter Universiade. They represented the Soviet Union, the Unified Team, and Russia.\n\nCoach Natalia Dubova paired him with Maya Usova in 1980. In 1988, they made their first appearance at the European Championships, placing fourth. The next season, they won silver at the 1989 European Championships in Birmingham, England and silver in their World Championships debut, in Paris. The next two seasons, they took bronze at Worlds.\n\nAt the 1991 World Figure Skating Championships they were very close to winning. They led after both the compulsory dances and original dance (although finishing 2nd in the original dance portion), and in the free dance received 4 1st place ordinals from the 9 judges. Nonetheless a strange ordinal situation led to them finishing only 3rd in the free dance and dropping to 3rd overall behind the Duchensays and Klimova and Ponomarenko.\n\nIn the 1991–92 season, Usova/Zhulin won silver at the 1992 European Championships in Lausanne, Switzerland and then captured their first Olympic medal, bronze, at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. Usova/Zhulin ended their season with silver at the 1992 World Championships in Oakland, California. They moved with Dubova from Moscow to Lake Placid, New York in September 1992.\n\nIn the 1992–93 season, Usova/Zhulin won the 1993 European Championships in Helsinki and the 1993 World Championships in Prague.\n\nThe next season, they were third at the 1994 European Championships in Copenhagen, behind Jayne Torvill / Christopher Dean and Oksana Grishuk / Evgeni Platov. They had been sitting in 1st place and seemingly ensured the title as Grishuk & Platov were mathematically out of gold medal contention, after Torvill & Dean were placed behind them in the free dance 5 judges to 4. However Grishuk & Platov won the free dance and changed the ordinals between Usova & Zhulin, and Torvill & Dean, dropping Usova & Zhulin to a 3rd-place finish. This loss seemed to indicate a loss of their #1 Russian status and instilled fear in their chances for the Olympic Gold medal. Their new free program to a collection of Nina Rota tunes also received negative reviews from fans and judges alike as it was a sharp departure from their previous work, and many critics felt it did not suit their sensual and elegant style.\n\nAt the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, they won the silver medal behind Grishuk/Platov. They tied for 1st place with Grishuk & Platov in the compulsory dances, and went into the free dance tied for overall 1st with Torvill & Dean who won the original dance, setting up an intense 3-way battle for gold. Unlike the Europeans all 3 teams in position to win gold simply by winning the free dance. In the free dance they received 3 1st place ordinals and 6 2nd place ordinals, but lost the gold to Grishuk & Platov who received 5 1st place ordinals, 1 2nd place ordinal, and 3 3rd place ordinals, losing the free dance and gold based on the majority rule, despite having no judges place them 3rd and a lower total of ordinals than Grishuk & Platov. Had 1 of 3 judges changed their mark by .1 Usova & Zhulin would have won the gold. Upset about the controversial Olympic loss, Usova & Zhulin withdrew from the 1994 World Figure Skating Championships, which they had intended to be their final amateur event.\n\nUsova/Zhulin skated together professionally from 1994 to 1997. They toured with Champions on Ice and won the World Professional Championships. Zhulin then skated with former rival, Oksana Grishuk, for one year. His former partner, Maya Usova, would compete for many years as a professional with former rival, Evgeni Platov.\n\nAfter retiring, Zhulin became a skating coach and choreographer. He coached in New Jersey before moving back to Russia in 2006. He is based in Moscow and often coaches in collaboration with Oleg Volkov. Zhulin has also been involved in Russian ice shows, such as \"Ice Age\".\n\nAmong others, Zhulin has coached:\nHis current students include:\n\nZhulin married Maya Usova in 1986 but the two eventually divorced. He was romantically involved with competitive rival Oksana Grishuk. In 2000, he married Tatiana Navka, with whom he has a daughter, Sasha, born in May 2000.\n\nZhulin became an American citizen in 2006. In April 2010, he and Navka filed for divorce. He married Natalia Mikhailova in August 2018. Their daughter, Ekaterina, was born on 10 January 2013 in Moscow.\n\nWith Usova\n\n"}

Brunansky averaged 24 home runs per 162 games. He finished his career with 1543 hits in 6289 at bats, 69 stolen bases, and 306 doubles.\n\nAfter being drafted in the 1st round (14th pick) of the 1978 amateur draft by the California Angels organization after his senior year at West Covina High School in California, Brunansky spent the next four years working his way up the Angels' minor league system before appearing in 11 games in 1981 after making his major league debut on 19 April. On May 11, 1982, he was traded by the Angels, along with pitcher Mike Walters, to the Minnesota Twins for pitcher Doug Corbett and infielder Rob Wilfong. The 21-year-old Brunansky was then inserted into the Twins' line up where he saw time at all three outfield positions and slugged his way to the first of his 8 consecutive seasons in which he hit at least 20 home runs.\n\nFollowing the 1982 season, Brunansky became a fixture in right field for the Twins starting there through the 1987 season. In 1982, Brunansky became the only Twin in franchise history to hit a grand slam, inside-the-park home run. He accomplished this in a July 19 home game at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in the 3rd inning off the Brewers' Jerry Augustine. Ironically, all four runs were considered unearned because of two Brewers' fielding errors earlier in the inning. Only 40 major league players have hit a grand slam, inside-the-park home run since 1950.\n\nHe was the Twins sole All-Star representative in 1985 and was a starter for the World Champion 1987 Minnesota Twins during what was arguably his best overall season (hitting .259, with 32 HR, 85 RBI and 83 Runs). Brunansky helped the Twins upset the Detroit Tigers in the American League Championship Series by hitting .412 with 2 home runs and 9 RBI in the 5-game series. He then had a somewhat invisibile World Series, only hitting .200 with one RBI. Just months after playing each other in the World Series, the Twins shocked both their fans and Tom Brunansky by trading him on 22 April 1988 to the St. Louis Cardinals for second baseman Tom Herr. Although the move was meant to strengthen the top of the order, Herr spent one lackluster season with the Twins in which he complained about being in Minnesota, while Brunansky continued his home run hitting ways for six more seasons.\n\nOn May 4, 1990, he was traded by the Cardinals to the Red Sox for closer Lee Smith. Brunansky played three seasons for the Red Sox, and is best remembered by Boston fans for his diving catch of an Ozzie Guillén line drive in the ninth inning of the season ending game that preserved the Red Sox victory, sending them to the 1990 ALCS. However, Brunansky hit .083, and the team as a whole hit a pitiful .183, as the Oakland A's swept the Sox in 4 games (before being swept themselves by the Cincinnati Reds in the 1990 World Series).\n\nAt the end of the 1992 season, he became a free agent and signed with the Milwaukee Brewers on 28 January, 1993. Brunansky struggled with the Brewers, batting just .183 with six home runs over 80 games that season. He played only 16 games the following season before being traded back to the Red Sox on June 16, 1994, for Dave Valle. He put up decent power numbers in Boston, hitting 10 doubles and 10 home runs in 48 games, but the strike-shortened 1994 season would be his last in the majors.\n\nFollowing retirement, Brunansky was hired in 2004 as the coach for the Poway High School baseball team in Poway, California. In July 2010 after finishing his sixth season at Poway, Brunansky accepted a job as the hitting coach for the Twins' Rookie League team, the Gulf Coast League Twins. At the end of the season, he was promoted to be the hitting coach for the Twins' AA League team, the New Britain Rock Cats. On November 1, 2011, Brunansky was again promoted to become the hitting coach for the Rochester Red Wings where he would help the team to their best season since 2008, finishing 72-72. On October 22, 2012, Brunansky was promoted to be the Twins' hitting coach. He was fired after the 2016 season.\n\nOn May 9, 2012, the Boston Red Sox honored Brunansky for his diving catch that helped the Red Sox clinch the AL East in 1990.\n\n\n"}

She accomplished this at the 2002–03 Junior Grand Prix Final in The Hague.\n\nAndo was born on December 18, 1987 in Nagoya, Japan. Her father died in a traffic accident when she was eight years old. In 2006, Ando joined Toyota and also entered Chukyo University as an adult learner, from which she graduated in March 2011. She learned English during her time training in the U.S. In January 2013, she left Toyota Motor.\n\nAndo gave birth to her daughter, named Himawari, in April 2013. Himawari means \"sunflower\" in Japanese.\n\nAndo began skating in 1996 at the age of eight. Her first coach was Rina Horie. Yuko Monna, whose students at that time included Mao Asada and Mai Asada, soon began teaching Ando. Beginning in the 2000–01 season, she was coached by Nobuo Satō, and her program already featured a 3Lz-3L.\n\nMaking her junior international debut, Ando won both of her 2001–02 ISU Junior Grand Prix (JGP) assignments and qualified for the JGP Final, where she also won gold. Nationally, she became the Japanese junior champion and senior bronze medalist. She concluded her season with bronze at the 2002 World Junior Championships.\n\nAndo won both of her 2002–03 JGP assignments. At the JGP Final, she became the first female skater to land a quad jump of any kind in a competition, performing a 4S on her way to the bronze medal. She remained the only woman ever to perform this feat until January 2018, when junior skater Alexandra Trusova ratified the same jump in competition. That season she defended her national Junior crown and took silver at the World Junior Championships.\n\nAndo was prominent in 2003–04, winning all her junior competitions including the Junior Grand Prix Final, her third consecutive national junior title, and the Junior Worlds. She also won the Japan Championships (senior) and placed 4th at her first senior World Championships.\n\nThe 2004–05 season was her first full season as a senior skater. She won two medals in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series and qualified for the Grand Prix Final, where she placed fourth. She won her second national senior title and placed sixth at 2005 Worlds.\n\nAndo relocated to the United States to train with Carol Heiss Jenkins in preparation for the 2005–06 season which included the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino. The season began well, when she won the silver medal at the 2005 Cup of Russia, but she finished 4th at the 2005 NHK Trophy and narrowly qualified for the Grand Prix Final, where she placed 4th. At Japanese Nationals, she placed 6th.\n\nAndo was named to the Japanese Olympic team in accordance with the criteria that were to include two seasons into consideration. At the Olympics, she placed 15th, after falling three times in her free skate, once on her quad attempt. She was not placed on the team to the World Championships the following month.\n\nAndo changed coaches again for the 2006–07 season. Training with her new coach, Nikolai Morozov, Ando won gold at the 2006 Skate America and silver at the 2006 Trophée Eric Bompard. She qualified for the Grand Prix Final, where she placed 5th. It was later revealed that Ando, along with the rest of the Japanese team, competed in Saint Petersburg while suffering stomach flu.\n\nAt the Japanese Nationals, Ando dislocated her shoulder while performing a spin in her free skate but skated on to place second overall behind Mao Asada.\n\nAt the 2007 Worlds, Ando placed second in both the short program and the free skate, and scored a total of 195.09 points to win the World Championship by less than one point over Asada. Ando set new personal bests in both the short program and the free skate, and a new personal best total score. She was named one of Vogue Japan's \"Women of the Year for 2007\" and received six other awards including the \"most valuable mention\" from the Japanese Olympic Committee.\n\nAndo's 2007–08 season began with a silver medal at the 2007 Skate America but placed fourth at the 2007 NHK Trophy, where she fell three times in her free skate. She did not qualify for the Grand Prix Final. At the Japan Championships, she won the free skate to place second overall, again behind Asada.\n\nIn the following February, Ando competed for the first time at Four Continents, where she attempted a 4S but popped it to a double. She won the bronze medal. At Worlds, Ando was 8th after the short program and was forced to withdraw during her free skate due to a leg muscle strain she had been suffering since that morning.\n\nIn the 2008–09 Grand Prix season, Ando placed third after Yuna Kim and Yukari Nakano at Skate America and placed second, behind Kim, again, at the Cup of China. At the Grand Prix Final, Ando stayed on her foot after an attempted 4S in her free skate program, the first time in competition since 2004, though the rotations were not considered enough and the jump was downgraded. Despite her last place finish, Ando stated that she was very happy with her performance, and that she would continue to work on her 4S.\n\nAt the Japan Championships, she was in 3rd place after the short program. During the free skate warm-up, she collided with Fumie Suguri, and injured her knee. She placed third and earned one of Japan's three spots at the 2009 World Championships. Before the event, the Japanese skating federation wanted her to leave Morozov. There, she won the bronze medal with a total of 190.38 after placing fourth in the short program and second in the free program.\n\nAndo represented Japan in a team competition, 2009 ISU World Team Trophy, in Tokyo, Japan, where she placed 3rd at the short program, 6th at the free skate and 5th overall. Team Japan was placed 3rd, winning the bronze medal.\n\nThe Japan Skating Federation set, as one of its criteria for choosing the skaters to send to the 2010 Winter Olympics, the highest Japanese medal finisher at the Grand Prix Final. With this in mind, Ando competed at Rostelecom Cup; she placed third in the short program and won the free skate to win the competition overall. At the NHK Trophy, she placed second in both segments and first overall. The two wins qualified Ando for the Grand Prix Final.\n\nAt this GP Final in Tokyo, Ando placed first in the short program, 0.56 points ahead of second-place finisher Yuna Kim, and second in the free skate. She was awarded the silver medal behind Kim but ahead of the bronze medalist Akiko Suzuki. With this result, she earned a spot in Japan's Olympic team despite placing fourth at the Japanese Championships.\n\nIn February 2010, Ando competed at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In the short program, she executed a 3Lz-3L combination but the 3L was downgraded. She earned levels 3 and 4 on spins. Ranked fourth in the short program and sixth in the free skate, she finished fifth overall. Although she originally intended to miss the 2010–11 season, she changed her mind following the Olympics.\n\nAt the 2010 World Championships, she finished fourth overall after placing eleventh in the short – having fallen on her opening 3Lz – and third in the free.\n\nAndo was assigned to Cup of China and the Rostelecom Cup for the 2010–11 Grand Prix season. In August, shortly before the beginning of the season, she changed her training base while abroad from Hackensack, New Jersey, USA, to Daugavpils, Latvia. She was originally said to have intended to move to Russia, but this plan had to be changed due to the smog and heat wave in Moscow.\n\nAt Cup of China, Ando attempted a 3Lz-3L combination in the short program, but the loop was deemed underrotated by the technical panel, and she placed third in this segment. She won the free skate segment with a clean performance and won the event overall, ahead of silver medalist Akiko Suzuki and bronze medalist Alena Leonova.\n\nAndo competed with a back injury at Rostelecom Cup after a collision with Abzal Rakimgaliev, from Kazakhstan, earlier in the week in practice. An underrotated 3F in the short program left her in 5th place after the short program but she placed first in the long program, winning the gold medal ahead of silver medalist Suzuki and bronze medalist Ashley Wagner.\n\nWith two gold medals in the Grand Prix circuit, Ando qualified for the Grand Prix Final in Beijing, where she performed her renewed short program that was completed only a week prior. Mistakes on two jumps left her in 5th place following the short program. She ranked first in the free skate but it was not enough to make up the gap from the short program, and she stayed 5th overall.\n\nOn December 26, Ando won her third Japanese National title over silver medalist Mao Asada and bronze medalist Kanako Murakami, and these three were nominated into the Japanese team for the World Championships, which at the time were scheduled to be held in Tokyo in March 2011. At the Four Continents Championships in February, Ando placed first in both the short program and free skating segments to win the competition overall. Her total score of 201.34 was a season's and personal best.\n\nAndo won the gold medal at the World Championships in Moscow, Russia, beating silver medalist Yuna Kim by 1.29 points and bronze medalist Carolina Kostner by 11.11 points.\n\nIn June, it was reported that Ando would sit out the 2011–12 Grand Prix series. She later decided not to compete all season, and in ISU events she appeared only once as an invited skater in the exhibition of the World Team Trophy. Instead, Ando participated in numerous shows worldwide, and among them, a benefit event for the victims of the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, called \"Reborn Garden\", was planned, co-choreographed and co-produced by Ando herself. The characteristic choreography by Ando and Tsurutani is to a non-stop sequence of various music assembled into one story scene, similar to a ballet program.\n\nAndo was assigned to the 2012 Cup of China and 2012 Trophee Eric Bompard. In May, Ando said she was uncertain if she was ready to return to competition but she had to sign a commitment. In October, she withdrew from both events because she was unable to find a permanent coach. At the end of the same month, Ando learned she was pregnant. She gave birth in April 2013 to a baby girl and resumed training a month later.\n\nAfter two years away from competition and five months after giving birth, Ando appeared at the 2013 Nebelhorn Trophy and won the silver medal behind Russian senior debutant Elena Radionova. Following her seventh-place finish at the 2014 Nationals, Ando announced her retirement from competitive skating and said that she intended to pursue a coaching career.\n\nAndo has worked for Japanese television and begun coaching.\n\nGP: Grand Prix; JGP: Junior Grand Prix\n\nSmall medals for short program and free skating awarded only at ISU Championships.\n\n\n"}

Kappes (born August 22, 1951) was the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (DDCIA), until his resignation on April 14, 2010. He had served in the CIA since 1981, with a two-year hiatus. A career clandestine operations professional, Kappes supervised the extraordinary rendition program, a non-judicial system of rendering persons suspected of terrorism to secret locations where most of them were interrogated. Kappes also helped persuade Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi to abandon his nuclear weapons program in 2003. In 2009, Kappes was convicted \"in absentia\" by an Italian court for his headquarters-based role in the rendition and torture of an Egyptian citizen who was kidnapped from Italian soil by the CIA.\n\nKappes earned a Bachelor of Science degree in pre-medicine from Ohio University and a Master of Science degree in pathology from Ohio State University. He served as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1976 to 1981.\n\nKappes joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 1981 and has held a variety of operational assignments in Europe, Middle East and managerial positions at CIA Headquarters. Kappes has been station chief in New Delhi, Frankfurt, Kuwait City and Moscow from 1996 to 1999. He also served in Pakistan. Kappes served as Chief of the Near East and South Asia Division from 1999 to 2000. Kappes served as Associate Deputy Director of Operations for Counterintelligence from 2000 to 2002, then as associate deputy director (ADDO) under Deputy Director for Operations (DDO) James Pavitt till 2004.\n\nTowards the end of his tenure with the CIA, he worked with President George W. Bush in negotiations with Libya that ended that country's weapons-of-mass-destruction (WMD) programs. In a joint diplomatic mission with the United Kingdom's MI6 head of counter terrorism Sir Mark Allen, the pair engaged with Libya's secret service head (Moussa Koussa, who later defected to the UK), which resulted in an end of support for terrorist activity by Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi’s Libya, and a resultant end of international sanctions against Libya.\n\nKappes was named Deputy Director for Operations (DDO) for the CIA in June 2004 and took office in August 2004 while the appointment of Porter Goss as the next Director of Central Intelligence was still pending in the Senate. Kappes succeeded James Pavitt, who resigned in June 2004. Both Kappes and Pavitt (and others) oversaw the CIA’s Directorate for Operations during the controversial Iraq WMD reporting. He served in that position until he resigned in November 2004. John E. McLaughlin, the then-Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, announced his departure the same week Kappes quit, thus exacerbating the rumored management problems for Goss.\n\nIt had been widely reported in the press that Kappes quit the Agency rather than carry out a request by Goss to reassign Michael Sulick, his then deputy. It is also reported that this incident occurred because Goss's chief of staff admonished the then assistant Deputy Director for Counterintelligence, Mary Margaret Graham – who later worked for the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) John Negroponte – about leaking personnel information. According to some news reports, Sulick had engaged in a shouting match with Goss's chief of staff.\n\nFor a brief period in between his appointments at the CIA, Kappes worked in the private security industry. In April 2005, ArmorGroup, a British security firm, named him vice president in charge of global strategy, and named him Chief Operating Officer (COO) in November 2005.\n\nKappes was named as the next DDCIA by Negroponte in May 2006. Kappes was believed to be the preferred choice for Director of the CIA in the incoming Obama administration by Senators Jay Rockefeller, the outgoing chairman, and Dianne Feinstein, the incoming chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Instead, Leon Panetta was appointed to the position in February 2009, and Kappes was retained as DDCIA, the latter a condition set by Feinstein in exchange for her support for the former.\nOn November 4, 2009, in a landmark ruling, Italian judge Oscar Magi convicted 22 American CIA operatives of kidnapping Muslim cleric Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr, known as Abu Omar, from the streets of Milan in 2003. Most of the top CIA officers had left the agency, with the exception of Kappes, who at the time was the assistant director of the CIA's clandestine branch.\n\nPer official reports, Kappes was responsible for the alteration of records regarding the death of a detainee at the 'Salt Pit', a secret CIA interrogation operation in Afghanistan. A detainee froze to death, after having been showered with water, and left outside overnight. Kappes made certain that the death was retained 'off the books'. According to two former officials who read a CIA inspector general's report on the incident, Kappes coached the base chief—whose identity is being withheld at the request of the CIA—on how to respond to the agency's investigators. They would report it as an accident.\n\nOn April 14, 2010, CIA Director Leon E. Panetta reported that Kappes would be retiring in May. The odd timing of the retirement, and lack of Presidential thanks for his years of service, led many to comment that this was a departure in disgrace.\n\n"}
{"id": "1921667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921667", "title": "Thomas Brassey", "text": "Thomas Brassey\n\nThomas Brassey (7 November 1805 – 8 December 1870) was an English civil engineering contractor and manufacturer of building materials who was responsible for building much of the world's railways in the 19th century. By 1847, he had built about one-third of the railways in Britain, and by time of his death in 1870 he had built one in every twenty miles of railway in the world. This included three-quarters of the lines in France, major lines in many other European countries and in Canada, Australia, South America and India. He also built the structures associated with those railways, including docks, bridges, viaducts, stations, tunnels and drainage works.\n\nAs well as railway engineering, Brassey was active in the development of steamships, mines, locomotive factories, marine telegraphy, and water supply and sewage systems. He built part of the London sewerage system, still in operation today, and was a major shareholder in Brunel's \"The Great Eastern\", the only ship large enough at the time to lay the first transatlantic telegraph cable across the North Atlantic, in 1864. He left a fortune of over £5 million, equivalent to about £600 million in 2020.\n\nThe Brassey family traced themselves back to a Norman ancestor from the town of Brécey in Lower Normandy who crossed to England with William the Conqueror in 1066. Initially their home was at Bulkeley, near Malpas in Cheshire, where they lived for nearly 600 years. At some time, and certainly by 1663, the family moved to Manor Farm in Buerton, a small settlement in the parish of Aldford, south of Chester. Thomas Brassey was the eldest son of John Brassey, a prosperous farmer, and his wife Elizabeth.\n\nThomas Brassey was educated at home until the age of 12, when he was sent to The King's School in Chester. Aged 16, he became an articled apprentice to a land surveyor and agent, William Lawton. Lawton was the agent of Francis Richard Price of Overton, Flintshire. During the time Brassey was an apprentice he helped to survey the new Shrewsbury to Holyhead road (this is now the A5), assisting the surveyor of the road. While he was engaged in this work he met the engineer for the road, Thomas Telford. When his apprenticeship ended at the age of 21, Brassey was taken into partnership by Lawton, forming the firm of \"Lawton and Brassey\". Brassey moved to Birkenhead where their business was established. Birkenhead at that time was a very small place; in 1818 it consisted of only four houses. The business flourished and grew, extending into areas beyond land surveying. At the Birkenhead site a brickworks and lime kilns were built. The business either owned or managed sand and stone quarries in Wirral. Amongst other ventures, the firm supplied the bricks for building the custom house for the port which was developing in the town. Many of the bricks needed for the growing city of Liverpool were supplied by the brickworks and Brassey devised new methods of transporting his materials, including a system similar to the modern method of palletting, and using a gravity train to take materials from the quarry to the port. When Lawton died, Brassey became sole manager of the company and sole agent and representative for Francis Price. It was during these years that he gained the basic experience for his future career.\n\nBrassey's first experiences of civil engineering were the construction of of the New Chester Road at Bromborough, and the building of a bridge at Saughall Massie, on the Wirral. During that time he met George Stephenson, who needed stone to build the Sankey Viaduct on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Stephenson and Brassey visited a quarry in Storeton, a village near Birkenhead, following which Stephenson advised Brassey to become involved in building railways. Brassey's first venture into railways was to submit a tender for building the Dutton Viaduct on the Grand Junction Railway, but he lost the contract to William Mackenzie, who had submitted a lower bid. In 1835 Brassey submitted a tender for building the Penkridge Viaduct, further south on the same railway, between Stafford and Wolverhampton, together with of track. The tender was accepted, the work was successfully completed, and the viaduct opened in 1837. Initially the engineer for the line was George Stephenson, but he was replaced by Joseph Locke, Stephenson's pupil and assistant. During this time Brassey moved to Stafford. Penkridge Viaduct still stands and carries trains on the West Coast Main Line.\n\nOn completion of the Grand Junction Railway, Locke moved on to design part of the London and Southampton Railway and encouraged Brassey to submit a tender, which was accepted. Brassey undertook work on the section of the railway between Basingstoke and Winchester, and on other parts of the line. The following year Brassey won contracts to build the Chester and Crewe Railway with Robert Stephenson as engineer and, with Locke as the engineer, the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway and the Sheffield and Manchester Railway.\n\nFollowing the success of the early railways in Britain, the French were encouraged to develop a railway network, in the first place to link with the railway system in Britain. To this end the Paris and Rouen Railway Company was established, and Locke was appointed as its engineer. He considered that the tenders submitted by French contractors were too expensive, and suggested that British contractors should be invited to tender. In the event only two British contractors took the offer seriously, Brassey and William Mackenzie. Instead of trying to outbid each other they tendered jointly, and their tender was accepted in 1841. This set a pattern for Brassey, who from then on worked in partnership with other contractors in most of his ventures. Between 1841 and 1844 Brassey and Mackenzie won contracts to build four French railways, with a total mileage of , the longest of which was the Orléans and Bordeaux Railway. Following the French revolution of 1848 there was a financial crisis in the country and investment in the railways almost ceased. This meant that Brassey had to seek foreign contracts elsewhere.\n\nIn January 1846, during the building of the long Rouen and Le Havre line, one of the few major structural disasters of Brassey's career occurred, the collapse of the Barentin Viaduct. The viaduct was built of brick at a cost of about £50,000 and was high. The reason for the collapse was never established, but a possible cause was the nature of the lime used to make the mortar. The contract stipulated that this had to be obtained locally, and the collapse occurred after a few days of heavy rain. Brassey rebuilt the viaduct at his own expense, this time using lime of his own choice. The rebuilt viaduct still stands and is in use today.\n\nDuring the time Brassey was building the early French railways, Britain was experiencing what was known as the \"railway mania\", when there was massive investment in the railways. Large numbers of lines were being built, but not all of them were built to Brassey's high standards. Brassey was involved in this expansion but was careful to choose his contracts and investors so that he could maintain his standards. During the one year of 1845 he agreed no less than nine contracts in England, Scotland and Wales, with a mileage totalling over . In 1844 Brassey and Locke began building the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway of , which was considered to be one of their greatest lines. It passed through the Lune Valley and then over Shap Fell. Its summit was high and the line had steep gradients, the maximum being 1 in 75. To the south the line linked by way of the Preston–Lancaster line to the Grand Junction Railway. Two important contracts undertaken in 1845 were the Trent Valley Railway of and the Chester and Holyhead line of . The former line joined the London and Birmingham Railway at Rugby to the Grand Junction Railway south of Stafford providing a line from London to Scotland which bypassed Birmingham. The latter line provided a link between London and the ferries sailing from Holyhead to Ireland and included Robert Stephenson's tubular Britannia Bridge over the Menai Strait. Also in 1845 Brassey received contracts for the Caledonian Railway which linked the railway at Carlisle with Glasgow and Edinburgh, covering a total distance of and passing over Beattock Summit. His engineer on this project was George Heald. That same year he also began contracts for other railways in Scotland, and in 1846 he started building parts of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway between Hull and Liverpool, across the Pennines.\n\nA contract for the Great Northern Railway was agreed in 1847, with William Cubitt as engineer-in-chief, although much of the work was done by William's son Joseph, who was the resident engineer. Brassey was the sole contractor for the line of . A particular problem was met in the marshy country of The Fens in providing a firm foundation for the railway and associated structures. Brassey was assisted in solving the problem by one of his agents, Stephen Ballard. Rafts or platforms were made of layers of faggot-wood and peat sods. As these sank, they dispersed the water and so a firm foundation was made. This line is still in use and forms part of the East Coast Main Line. Also in 1847 Brassey began to build the North Staffordshire Railway. By this time the \"railway mania\" was coming to an end and contracts in Britain were becoming increasingly more difficult to find. By the end of the \"railway mania\", Brassey had built one-third of all the railways in Britain.\n\nFollowing the end of the \"railway mania\" and the drying up of contracts in France, Brassey could have retired as a rich man. Instead he decided to expand his interests, initially in other European countries. His first venture in Spain was the Barcelona and Mataró Railway of in 1848. In 1850 he undertook his first contract in the Italian States, a short railway of , the Prato and Pistoia Railway. This was to lead to bigger contracts in Italy, the next being the Turin–Novara line of in 1853, followed by the Central Italian Railway of . In Norway, with Sir Morton Peto and Edward Betts, Brassey built the Oslo to Bergen Railway of which passes through inhospitable terrain and rises to nearly . In 1852 he resumed work in France with the Mantes and Caen Railway of and, in 1854, the Caen and Cherbourg Railway of . The Dutch were relatively slow to start building railways but in 1852 with Locke as engineer, Brassey built the Dutch Rhenish Railway of . Meanwhile, he continued to build lines in England, including the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway of , the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway of , the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway of and the North Devon Railway from Minehead to Barnstaple of .\n\nIn 1852 Brassey took out the largest contract of his career, which was to build the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada. This line passed from Quebec, along the valley of the Saint Lawrence River, and then to the north of Lake Ontario to Toronto. The line totalled in length. The consulting engineer for the project was Robert Stephenson and the company's engineer for the whole undertaking was Alexander Ross. Brassey worked in partnership with Peto, Betts and Sir William Jackson. The line crossed the river at Montreal by the Victoria Bridge. This was a tubular bridge designed by Robert Stephenson and was the longest bridge in the world at the time, measuring some . The bridge opened in 1859 and the formal opening ceremony was carried out the following year by the Prince of Wales. The construction of the line caused considerable problems. The main problem was the raising of the necessary finance and at one stage Brassey travelled to Canada to appeal personally for assistance. Other difficulties arose from the severity of the Canadian winter, the waterways being frozen for around six months each year, and resistance from Canadian businessmen. The line was an engineering success but a financial failure, with the contractors losing £1 million.\n\nThe contract for the Grand Trunk Railway included all the materials required for building the bridge and the railway, including the rolling stock. To manufacture the metallic components, Brassey built a new factory in Birkenhead which he called \"The Canada Works\". A suitable site was found by George Harrison, Brassey's brother-in-law, and the factory was built with a quay alongside to take ocean-going ships. The works was managed by George Harrison with a Mr. Alexander and William Heap as assistants. The machine shop was in length and included a blacksmiths' shop with 40 furnaces, anvils and steam hammers, a coppersmiths' shop, and fabrication, woodwork and pattern shops. There was also a well-stocked library and a reading room for all the workforce.\n\nThe fitting shop was designed to manufacture 40 locomotives a year and a total of 300 were produced in the next eight years. The first locomotive, given its trial in May 1854, was named \"Lady Elgin\", after the wife of the Governor General of Canada of the time, the Earl of Elgin. For the bridge hundreds of thousands of components were required and all were manufactured in Birkenhead or in other English factories to Brassey's specifications. These were all stamped and coded, loaded into ships to be taken to Quebec and then by rail to the site of the bridge for assembly. The central tube of the bridge contained over 10,000 pieces of iron, perforated by holes for half a million rivets, and when it was assembled every piece and hole was true.\n\nBrassey played a part in helping the British forces to success in the Crimean War. The Black Sea port of Sevastopol was held by the Russians. The British government, in alliance with the French and the Turks, sent an army of 30,000 to Balaclava, another port in a neighbouring bay of the Black Sea, from which to attack Sevastopol. Sevastopol was besieged in September 1854 by the British and allied forces. It was hoped that the siege would be short but with the coming of winter the conditions were appalling and it was proving difficult to transport clothing, food, medical supplies and weaponry from Balaclava to the front. When news of the problem arrived in Britain, Brassey joined with Peto and Betts in offering to build a railway \"at cost\" to transport these necessary supplies. They shipped out the equipment and materials for building the railway, which had been intended for other undertakings, together with an army of navvies to carry out the work. Within seven weeks, in severe winter conditions, the railway from Balaclava to the troops besieging Sevastopol was completed. It then became possible to move supplies easily to the front and Sevastopol was finally taken in September 1855.\n\nIn addition to building more railways in Britain and in other European countries, Brassey undertook contracts in other continents. In South America his railways totalled , in Australia , and in India and Nepal .\n\nIn 1866 there was a great economic slump, caused by the collapse of the bank of Overend, Gurney and Company, and many of Brassey's colleagues and competitors became insolvent. However, despite setbacks, Brassey survived the crisis and drove ahead with the projects he already had in hand. These included the Lemberg (now Lviv) and Czernowicz (now Chernivtsi) Railway in Galicia (part of Austrian Empire) which continued to be constructed despite the Austro-Prussian War which was taking place in the locality.\n\nFrom 1867 Brassey's health was beginning to decline, but he continued to negotiate further contracts, including the Czernowicz and Suczawa Railway in the Austrian Empire. In 1868 he suffered a mild stroke but he continued to work and in April 1869 he embarked on an extensive tour of over in Eastern Europe. By the time of his death he had built one mile in every twenty miles of railway in the world.\n\nBrassey's works were not limited to railways and associated structures. In addition to his factories in Birkenhead, he built an engineering works in France to supply materials for his contracts there. He built a number of drainage systems, and a waterworks at Calcutta. Brassey built docks at Greenock, Birkenhead, Barrow-in-Furness and London. His London docks were the Victoria Docks which had a water area of over . The contract for this was agreed in 1852 in partnership with Peto and Betts and the docks were opened in 1857. Also included in the contract were warehouses and wine vaults totalling an area of about . The dockside machinery was worked by hydraulic power supplied by William Armstrong. The dock had links to Brassey's London, Tilbury and Southend Railway and thereby to the entire British rail system.\n\nIn 1861 Brassey built part of the London sewerage system for Joseph Bazalgette. This was a stretch of the Metropolitan Mid Level Sewer of which started at Kensal Green, passed under Bayswater Road, Oxford Street and Clerkenwell to the River Lea. It was one of the earliest ventures to use steam cranes. The undertaking was considered to have been one of Brassey's most difficult. The sewer is still in operation today. He also worked with Bazalgette to build the Victoria Embankment on the north bank of the River Thames from Westminster Bridge to Blackfriars Bridge.\n\nBrassey gave financial help to Brunel to build his ship \"The Leviathan\", which was later called \"The Great Eastern\" and which in 1854 was six times larger than any other vessel in the world. Brassey was a major shareholder in the ship and after Brunel's death, he, together with Gooch and Barber, bought the ship for the purpose of laying the first Transatlantic telegraph cable across the North Atlantic in 1864.\n\nBrassey had other ideas which were ahead of his time. He tried to interest the governments of the United Kingdom and Europe in the idea of a tunnel under the English Channel but this came to nothing. He also wanted to build a canal through the Isthmus of Darién (now the Isthmus of Panama) but this idea similarly had no success.\n\nIn most of Brassey's contracts he worked in partnership with other contractors, in particular with Peto and Betts. The planning of the details of the projects was done by the engineers. Sometimes there would be a consulting engineer and below him another engineer who was in charge of the day-to-day activities. During his career Brassey worked with many engineers, the most illustrious being Robert Stephenson, Joseph Locke and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The day-to-day work was overseen by agents, who managed and controlled the activities of the subcontractors.\n\nThe actual work was done by labourers, in those days known as navvies, supervised by gangers (or foremen). In the early days the navvies were mainly English and many of them had formerly worked on building the canals. They were later joined by men from Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The number of Irish workers particularly increased following the potato famine. Brassey paid his navvies and gangers a wage and provided food, clothing, shelter and, in some projects, a lending library. On overseas contracts local labour would be used if it were available, but the work was often done or supplemented by British workers. The agent on the site had overall responsibility for a project. He had to be a man of great capability, working for a fee plus a percentage of the profits, with penalties for late finishing and inducements to complete the work early.\n\nBrassey had considerable skill in choosing good men to work in this way and in delegating the work. Having taken on a contract at an agreed price he would make a suitable sum of money available to the agent to meet the costs. If the agent were able to fulfil the work at a lower cost he could keep the remainder of the money. If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable, Brassey would cover these additional costs. He used hundreds of such agents. At the peak of his career, for well over 20 years, Brassey was employing on average some 80,000 people in many countries in four continents.\n\nDespite this he had neither an office nor office staff, dealing with all the correspondence himself. Much of the detail of his works were held in his memory. He travelled with a personal valet and later had a cashier. But all his letters were written by him; it is recorded that on one occasion after the rest of his party had gone to bed, 31 letters had been written by Brassey overnight. Although he won a large number of contracts, his bids were not always successful. It has been calculated that for every contract awarded, around six others had been unsuccessful.\n\nBrassey was given a number of honours to celebrate his achievements, including the French Légion d'honneur, the Italian Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus and the Austrian Iron Crown (the first time this had been awarded to a foreigner).\n\nIn 1831 he married Maria Harrison, the second daughter of Joseph Harrison, a forwarding and shipping agent with whom he had come into contact during his early days in Birkenhead. Maria gave Thomas considerable support and encouragement throughout his career. She encouraged him to bid for the contract for Dutton Viaduct and, when that was unsuccessful, to apply for the next available contract. Thomas' work led to frequent moves of home in their early years; from Birkenhead to Stafford, Kingston upon Thames, Winchester and then Fareham. On each occasion Maria supervised the packing of their possessions and the removal. The Harrison children had been taught to speak French, while Thomas himself was unable to do so. Therefore, when the opportunity arose to apply for the French contracts, Maria was willing to act as interpreter and encouraged Thomas to bid for them. This resulted in moves to Vernon in Normandy, then to Rouen, on to Paris and back again to Rouen. Thomas refused to learn French and Maria acted as interpreter for all his French undertakings. Maria organised the education of their three sons. In time the family established a more-or-less permanent base in Lowndes Square, Belgravia, London. They had three surviving sons, who all gained distinction in their own right:\n\nIn 1870 Brassey was told that he had cancer but he continued to visit his working sites. One of his last visits was to the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway, only a few miles from his first railway contract at Penkridge. In the late summer of 1870 he took to his bed at his home in St Leonards-on-Sea. There he was visited by members of his work force, not only his engineers and agents, but also his navvies, many of whom had walked for days to come and pay their respects.\n\nWhen Brassey's business friend, Edward Betts, became insolvent in 1867, Brassey bought Betts' estate at Preston Hall, Aylesford in Kent on behalf of his second son, Henry.\n\nIn 1870 Brassey purchased Heythrop Park, a baroque house situated in an estate of northeast of Oxford as a wedding present for his third son, Albert.\n\nOn 8 December 1870 Thomas Brassey died from a brain haemorrhage in Victoria Hotel, St Leonards and was buried in the churchyard of St Laurence's Church, Catsfield, Sussex where a memorial stone has been erected. His estate was valued at £5,200,000 which consisted of \"under £3,200,000 in UK\" and \"over £2,000,000\" in a trust fund. The \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" describes him as \"one of the wealthiest of the self-made Victorians\".\n\nIt is not easy to be objective about the nature of Thomas Brassey's character because the earliest biography by Helps was commissioned by the Brassey family and the latest, rather short, biography was written by his great-great-grandson, Tom Stacey. There is virtually no remaining material of value to a biographer available today. There is no private correspondence, there are no diaries and none of his personal reminiscences.\n\nJudging by his achievements alone, he must have been a remarkable man. He had enormous drive, an ability to remain calm despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He was a man of honour who always kept his word and his promise. He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.\n\nWalker, in his 1969 biography, tried to make an accurate assessment of Brassey using Helps and other sources. He found it difficult to discover anyone who had a bad word to say about him, either during his life or since. Brassey expected a high standard of work from his employees; Cooke states that his \"standards of quality were fastidious in the extreme\". There can be no doubt about some of his qualities. He was exceptionally hardworking, and had an excellent memory and ability to perform mental arithmetic. He was a good judge of men, which enabled him to select the best people to be his agents. He was scrupulously fair with his subcontractors and kind to his navvies, supporting them financially at their times of need. He would at times undertake contracts of little benefit to himself to provide work for his navvies. The only faults which his eldest son could identify were a tendency to praise traits and actions of other people he would condemn in his own family, and an inability to refuse a request. No criticism of him could be found from the engineers with whom he worked, his business associates, his agents or his navvies. He paid his men fairly and generously.\n\nThe \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" states \"His greatest achievement was to raise the status of the civil engineering contractor to the eminence already attained in the mid-nineteenth century by the engineer\". Walker regards him as \"one of the giants of the nineteenth century\".\n\nNone of his three sons became involved in their father's work and the business was wound up by administrators. The sons created a memorial to their parents in St Erasmus' Chapel in Chester cathedral. This consists of a backcloth to the altar inscribed to their parents' memory, and a bust of their father to the north of the altar. The memorial is by Sir Arthur Blomfield and the bust by M. Wagmiller. There is also a bust of Thomas in Chester's Grosvenor Museum and plaques to his memory in Chester station. Streets named after him in Chester are Brassey Street and Thomas Brassey Close (which is off Lightfoot Street).\n\nIn November 2005, Penkridge celebrated the bicentenary of Brassey's birth and a special commemorative train was run from Chester to Holyhead. In January 2007, children from Overchurch Junior School in Upton, Wirral celebrated the life of Brassey. In April 2007 a plaque was placed on Brassey's first bridge at Saughall Massie. In the village of Bulkeley, near Malpas, Cheshire, is a tree called the 'Brassey Oak' on land once owned by the Brassey family. This was planted to celebrate Thomas' 40th birthday in 1845. It was surrounded by four inscribed sandstone pillars tied together by iron rails but due to the growth of the tree these burst and the stones fell. They were recovered and in 2007 were replaced in a more accessible place with an information board.\n\nIn 2019 a blue plaque was installed by Conservation Areas Wirral on the remaining structure of his Canada Works building in Beaufort Road, now part of the Wirral Waters area in Birkenhead.\n\n\n"}

They played their first gig at the Champion Hotel, Fitzroy in January 1980. Nic Chancellor was previously a roadie for 1970s punk band, the News, and a doorman at Bernhardt's Nite Club. Darren Smith played in the Proles. Andrea Jones of \"Rolling Stone\" felt that the group members were \"very cynical about the softening of the new music. They are adamant that it will be rapidly followed by a resurgence in aggression and when that happens, The Zorros will be the front runners.\" Chancellor told her that \"We get more of a kick out of playing. Hopefully we'll be round long enough to make a record. But it's a big thrill to play for an audience. It'd be an even bigger thrill to play and make money\"\n\nThe Zorros were popular in the Melbourne music scene of the early 1980s, playing at numerous local venues such as the Crystal Ballroom, Bombay Rock, Brunswick and The Esplanade, St Kilda. In October 1981 released a 7\" single on Au Go Go Records, \"Too Young\", written by Chancellor. It was mixed and produced by Tony Cohen (The Birthday Party), which went to number 3 on the Melbourne 3RRR charts.\n\nIn 1988 they released a self-titled, eight-track, EP via Funnel Web Records and Dreamtime Software on a music cassette.\n\nThey played at the final live performances at the Crystal Ballroom on 31 October 1987 and played at inner city venues such as Prince of Wales and the Esplanade until 1994. Evolving from Melbourne's indie rock scene, The Zorros played with other bands such as INXS, Rose Tattoo, 21 Faces, Z Cars, Marching Girls and La Femme.

SR 90 begins at Lincoln Boulevard (State Route 1) near Marina del Rey as the Marina Expressway. It then goes past a few intersections before becoming the Marina Freeway. It then continues eastward approximately along the border between the Del Rey and Westchester neighborhoods of the city of Los Angeles before terminating in Slauson Avenue in southern Culver City to just past Culver Boulevard.\n\nThe eastern portion of SR 90 runs along Imperial Highway between Beach Boulevard (State Route 39) in La Habra and State Route 91 in Anaheim Hills, also passing through Brea and Yorba Linda. A stretch in Yorba Linda between Yorba Linda Boulevard and Orangethorpe Avenue was relinquished to the city in 2002 and built to freeway standards. The city renamed it the Richard M. Nixon Freeway in honor of the 37th President of the United States, Richard Nixon, who was born in Yorba Linda less than half a mile away from the road.\n\nThe west segment of SR 90 begins at Lincoln Boulevard (State Route 1) in the Del Rey district of Los Angeles. It heads east along the Marina Expressway, past several intersections, and becomes the Marina Freeway after crossing Ballona Creek. After two interchanges - with Centinela Avenue and Interstate 405 - SR 90 and the freeway end at Slauson Avenue.\n\nThe east segment begins at the intersection of Imperial Highway and Beach Boulevard (State Route 39) in La Habra. It heads east and southeast on Imperial Highway, ending at State Route 91 about after crossing the Santa Ana River from Yorba Linda into Anaheim. A portion of the road in Yorba Linda is built to freeway standards; it is now known as the Richard M. Nixon Parkway after the city accepted maintenance in 2002. However, the same state law that authorized relinquishment required the city to \"maintain signs directing motorists to the continuation of Route 90\".\n\nSR 90 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.\n\nLegislative Route 221 (the Slauson Freeway, now the Marina Freeway) was defined in 1947 to run from pre-1964 Legislative Route 60 (now State Route 1) east to pre-1964 Legislative Route 165 (now Interstate 110). A 1959 extension took it east to pre-1964 Legislative Route 170 (now Interstate 605).\n\nTo the east, Legislative Route 176 (the Yorba Linda Freeway, now also the Marina Freeway) was defined in 1939 from pre-1964 Legislative Route 62 (now State Route 39) east and southeast to pre-1964 Legislative Route 43 (now State Route 91). A 1959 extension took it west to pre-1964 Legislative Route 174 (later State Route 42) near Norwalk.\n\nIn the 1964 renumbering, LR 221 was assigned State Route 90, but LR 176 all became part of State Route 42, along with the connecting LR 174 to the west. The piece of LR 176 between I-605 and SR 39 was reassigned to SR 90 in 1965, and the rest east to SR 91 became part of SR 90 in 1968 (at the same time as SR 42 became Interstate 105).\n\nOriginally planned as the \"Slauson Freeway\", Route 90 was slated to extend across southern Los Angeles County and northern Orange County, ending at the Riverside Freeway in eastern Anaheim. However, by the 1960s, community opposition had reduced it to what is effectively a minor spur of I-405 to Marina Del Rey (derisively dubbed the \"Slauson Cutoff\" by comedian Johnny Carson). It was renamed the Richard M. Nixon Freeway for a brief period in the early 1970s, but after Nixon's resignation in the wake of the Watergate scandal, its name was changed to the current appellation.\n\nFrom I-405 west to Centinela Avenue, the Marina Freeway is 8 lanes wide, before it quickly narrows to 4 lanes at the Culver Boulevard exit. The freeway ends approximately west of Culver Boulevard, and continues as an expressway. There has been talk of extending the Marina Expressway slightly west of Lincoln Boulevard (Route 1) to Admiralty Way (approximately ) to accommodate ongoing expansion of the Marina Del Rey area. Strong opposition to this makes actualization of this plan uncertain.\n\nThere were once plans to connect the two sections via the Slauson Freeway and Yorba Linda Freeway, mostly parallel to Slauson Avenue, but this was never built. The full route was added to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959.\n\nIn 2002 the City of Yorba Linda assumed responsibility for Imperial Highway to complete various construction projects within city limits when the State Assembly passed AB 887; it lost its state route designation in the process and is now called the Richard M. Nixon Parkway within the city.\n\nBy 2005, construction on the western end of the Marina Freeway began, to extend the freeway terminus from Culver Boulevard to approximately west of Culver Boulevard by building a full interchange at Culver. The freeway extension was completed in early 2007. The freeway extension also allows Route 90 drivers to avoid a traffic signal at Alla Road (just west of Culver Boulevard.). After the end of the freeway, a pair of frontage roads operating as an expressway continues as Route 90 up to Route 1 (Lincoln Boulevard). Signalized intersections occur at Mindanao Way and Lincoln Boulevard, which is the end of the expressway in Marina del Rey. The reason for the extension is to relieve traffic congestion on surface streets.\n\n"}

Built in 1985 as the Market Post Tower, it was designed to provide a mix of office and retail space. When first built, the building was controversial due to its gold-colored glass exterior, which produced high light and heat reflection. In its early years, the owners struggled financially with the property and were forced to put it up for sale in 1987. While the intended tenants did not materialize, the building proved popular with telecom carriers as an Internet exchange center, with MAE-West on the 13th floor, one of the oldest and most well known Internet exchanges. Many carriers maintain collocation space in the building to support their interconnections through MAE-West (so-called \"public peering\") as well as direct interconnections (\"private peering\").\n\nTower 55 remains mixed-use, comprising office, telecom, and retail space, but it is perhaps most well known for its use by internet network service, peering, and colocation providers.

{"id": "1921678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921678", "title": "Thomas Chubb", "text": "Thomas Chubb\n\nThomas Chubb (29 September 1679 – 8 February 1747) was a lay English Deist writer born near Salisbury. He saw Christ as a divine teacher, but held reason to be sovereign over religion. He questioned the morality of religions, while defending Christianity on rational grounds. Despite little schooling, Chubb was well up on the religious controversies. His \"The True Gospel of Jesus Christ, Asserted\" sets out to distinguish the teaching of Jesus from that of the Evangelists. Chubb's views on free will and determinism, expressed in \"A Collection of Tracts on Various Subjects\" (1730), were extensively criticised by Jonathan Edwards in \"Freedom of the Will\" (1754).\n\nOne of Chubb's published tracts, \"The Previous Question with Regard to Religion\", went through four editions, three in 1725. His tracts were collected in a quarto volume in 1730 and attracted wide notice. (A second, two-volume edition in 1754 included 35 tracts.) Chubb was encouraged to write further tracts. A disciple of Samuel Clarke, he gradually moved from Arianism into a modified Deism.\n\nIn 1731 he published a \"Discourse concerning Reason... [showing that] reason is, or else that it ought to be, a sufficient guide in matters of Religion\". Some \"reflections\" upon \"moral and positive duty\" were added, as suggested by Clarke's \"Exposition of the Catechism\". In 1732 \"The Sufficiency of Reason further considered...\" was appended to an \"enquiry\" against a recent sermon by Samuel Croxall arguing that to celebrate Charles I's martyrdom was inconsistent with celebrating William III's arrival.\n\nIn 1734 came four tracts of his attacking the common theory of inspiration, arguing that the resurrection of Christ was no proof of his divine mission and criticising the story of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac. The whole argument showed increasing scepticism, and the assertion about Abraham led to some controversy. He returned to the question in 1735, in some \"Observations\" on Thomas Rundle's nomination to the Diocese of Gloucester, Rundle having been accused of disbelieving the story. Three tracts were added that continued the former discussion.\n\nIn 1738 Chubb published \"The True Gospel of Jesus Christ asserted\", which provoked various attacks, including one from Ebenezer Hewlett. It was followed by \"The True Gospel of Jesus vindicated\", and \"An Enquiry into the Ground and Foundation of Religion, wherein it is shown that Religion is founded on Nature\". He persisted in stating that true Christianity consisted of a belief that morality alone could make men acceptable to God, that repentance for sin would secure God's mercy, and that there would be future retribution. His \"Enquiry into the Ground and Foundation of Religion\" (1740) includes a controversy with Henry Stebbing. Chubb argues against interpreting literally the command to give all to the poor, noting that Stebbing himself was a pluralist with two livings, a preachership and an archdeaconry, and due to be chancellor of the Diocese of Salisbury, so that he could hardly interpret the command literally to himself.\n\nChubb's 1741 \"Discourse on Miracles\" states that they could at most afford a \"probable proof\" of a revelation. In 1743 his \"Enquiry concerning Redemption\" is a defence of himself against some sneers by William Warburton. \"The Ground and Foundation of Morality considered\" (1745) is an attack on Thomas Rutherforth's theory of self-love. The last work that Chubb published himself was \"Four Dissertations\" (1746), attacking some Old Testament passages with a freedom that gave wide offence.\n\nJoseph Waligore states in a 2012 article, \"The Piety of the English Deists\", that Chubb discussed prayer more than any other deist. Chubb's longest writing on the subject was a 30-page pamphlet, \"An Enquiry Concerning Prayer\", where he began by insisting that prayer was a duty God required for achieving a closer relationship with him. The purpose of prayer was to render someone\n\"a suitable and proper object of God's special care and love. For as prayer is an address or application of a dependent being to his supreme governour, and original benefactor... It naturally draws forth our souls in filial fear, in hope and trust, in love, delight, and joy in God; and creates in us a just concern to please him, and to approve ourselves in his sight; and consequently to put on that purity and piety, humility and charity which is the spirit and practice of true Christianity.\"\n\nChubb said we should pray often and\n\n\"it is when we forget God, when God is not in all our thoughts, that we do amiss; then our minds and lives are corrupted and defiled.\"\n\nHe also discussed whom we should pray to. First he said we should not pray to dead human souls, as we have no reason to think they hear our prayers or have any power to help us. Then he discussed whether we should pray to angels. Unlike Morgan – who thought we should pray to both God and angels – Chubb thought we probably should not pray to angels. He said even though they were \"ministering spirits\", we could not be sure they heard our prayers, and they might not be at liberty to help us without God's direct guidance. He spent a final ten pages wondering whether we should pray to Jesus or just to God the Father, concluding we should pray to God the Father \"in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ\".\n\nChubb was sure that God heard all our petitions, but he did not think God answered them all in the way we wished. God answered only if they were for lawful things and people prayed earnestly \"with a modest resignation to God's will\".[vi] Chubb thought that God sometimes gave us harmful things we had prayed for, but then God acted \"in displeasure\". In another tract, he was more pessimistic about God's positive response rate to our prayers. He cited evidence that God did not often answer our prayers: over the previous 200 years, millions of sincere, fervent prayers had petitioned God for the defeat of the Antichrist, but the Roman Catholic hierarchy or other interests ostensibly bent on defeating God's kingdom still existed.\n\n\n\n"}

After the original tour in 2003 ended, it was released on DVD, CD, and was written into a trilogy of novels and series of comic books.\n\n\"!HERO\" is a rock opera modernizing Jesus's last two years of life, as described in the Bible. The story takes place in New York City, in Brooklyn. The world government in this near-future dystopic Earth is centered under the International Confederation of Nations (ICON). Under the iron fist of I.C.O.N., nearly all religion in the world has been wiped out, except for small occult and mystic sects. Only one synagogue in Brooklyn exists. Currently, New York City is a police-occupied warzone between ethnic gangs and small, isolated revolutionary groups fighting I.C.O.N. Of all the ancient world religions, only Judaism survives and flourishes, at least, as much as it can.\n\nIn Bethlehem, PA, a child named Jesus, but referred to as HERO, is born and forced to flee with his family to the small Jewish section of Brooklyn. Jesus grows up and begins to preach and teach the principles of Christianity to the people of New York City, teaching people to love their enemies and care for each other. I.C.O.N. realizes HERO is a threat, and the Chief of police Devlin (a derivative of the Devil or Satan), with the help of chief Rabbi Kai (Caiaphas), conspire to end HERO's revolutionary teachings.\n\nThe Opera is narrated by \"Agent Hunter\", a former I.C.O.N. agent who met HERO and was soon thrown into prison for joining him against I.C.O.N. The opera also features Petrov (Peter), Maggie (Mary Magdalene), and Jude (Judas Iscariot) the latter who conspires with Kai and Devlin to betray HERO. The storyline progresses through several stories about Jesus' miracles and sermons, using references from the Bible's four gospels, continues through Jesus' execution, at the hands of I.C.O.N's angry mob, and eventually ending with his resurrection.\n\n\n"}

The \"Almanac\" has been called \"definitive and essential for anyone writing seriously about campaigns and Congress.\" Barone is also a regular commentator on United States elections and political trends for the Fox News Channel. In April 2009, Barone joined the \"Washington Examiner\", leaving his position of 18 years at \"U.S. News & World Report\". He is based at the American Enterprise Institute as a resident fellow. He has written numerous books and essays on American political and demographic history.\n\nBarone was born in Highland Park, Michigan, the son of Alice Katherine (née Darcy) and Charles Gerald \"Jerry\" Barone, MD, a surgeon. His father was of Italian descent and his mother of Irish descent. He graduated from Cranbrook School in 1962. He received a bachelor's degree from Harvard College in 1966 and a law degree from Yale Law School in 1969, where he was an editor of the \"Yale Law Journal\". After law school he clerked for Judge Wade H. McCree of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Although he has been conservative as an adult, in the 1960s he worked as an intern for Jerome Cavanagh, the Democratic mayor of Detroit. He was also a supporter of George McGovern in 1972. In 1975 Barone married Joan Shorenstein. She died at age 38 in 1985 after a 10-year battle with cancer. In 2011 he married the Brazilian novelist and diplomat Alexandre Vidal Porto, in New York City.\n\nBarone is a senior political analyst for the \"Washington Examiner\", where he writes a twice weekly column and contributes to their blog.

Barone has said he is not religious, although he is sympathetic to and respectful of social conservatives.\n\nHis commentary has been concerned with the topic of immigration. Perhaps partly as a result of being a descendant of Italian immigrants, Barone takes an optimistic view of contemporary immigration into the US. He says that Hispanic immigration has parallels to the Italian experience and that, given the right circumstances, current and future Hispanic and other immigrants can become Americanized and assimilated, just as the Italians were.\n\nIn November 2008, Barone said journalists criticized Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin because \"she did not abort her Down syndrome baby.\" Barone later said he was \"attempting to be humorous and ... went over the line.\"\n\nBarone has been covering the 2020 presidential election through numerous opinion pieces published in the Washington Examiner.\n\nHe is the author of several books:\n• \"Shaping Our Nation: How Surges of Migration Transformed America and Its Politics\" (Growth Forum, 2013)\n\n"}

He was a pitcher in Major League Baseball for seventeen years and racked up 164 wins. All but one of those wins came with the Chicago White Sox. A knuckleball specialist, he threw left-handed and batted right-handed, stood tall and was listed at . He was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1960, Wood was signed out of Belmont High School by the Boston Red Sox. He pitched on-and-off for them for a few seasons before being traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in late September 1964. After two seasons with Pittsburgh, he was traded to the White Sox after the 1966 season. When he arrived, knuckleball specialist Hoyt Wilhelm advised him to use his knuckleball exclusively. Taking Wilhelm's advice, Wood's career took off, first as a relief pitcher, and then as a starting pitcher. With the White Sox, Wood became well known as a durable workhorse, and one of the last pitchers to consistently throw well over 300 innings in a season.\n\nAs a relief pitcher in 1968, Wood set the major league record (since broken) of 88 games pitched in a season. He converted to starting pitcher in 1971, and continued to display unusual durability. During the years 1971-74, Wood averaged 45 games started and 347 innings pitched, winning a total of 90 games, while losing 69. He led the American League in games started in each year from 1972 through 1975, and he was the league leader in both wins and innings pitched in 1972 and 1973. Wood finished second in the voting for the American League Cy Young Award, losing a close vote to Gaylord Perry.\n\nWood's resilience, which was attributed to the less stressful nature of the knuckleball delivery, led to some unusual feats of endurance. On May 28, 1973, while pitching for the White Sox against the Cleveland Indians, Wood pitched the remainder of a 21-inning carryover game that had been suspended two nights earlier, allowing only two hits in five innings to earn the victory. He then started the regularly scheduled game and pitched a four-hit complete game shutout, earning two wins in the same night. Later that season, on July 20, Wood started both ends of a doubleheader, making him the last pitcher to do so. He lost both of those games. The knuckleball is also difficult to control, and in 1977, Wood tied a record by hitting three consecutive batters in the first inning.\n\nWood's 1976 campaign was cut short on May 9 when a line-drive single hit by Ron LeFlore fractured his left kneecap in the sixth inning of a 4–2 White Sox victory over the Detroit Tigers at Tiger Stadium. He had surgery the next day, but the outlook was bleak. Many predicted that he would never pitch again, but after considerable rehabilitation, he did some pitching for two more seasons with the White Sox. However, he showed few signs of his former mastery. He retired in 1978, moving back to his native New England.\n\nIn a seventeen-year major league career, Wood compiled a 164-156 record with a 3.24 ERA in 661 games played. He had 1,411 strikeouts in 2,684 innings pitched. He compiled 24 shutouts and 114 complete games in 297 games started.

Jacob Hacker describes him as the \"dean of welfare state scholars.\" Over the past decade his research has moved towards family demographic issues. A synthesis of his work was published as \"Families in the 21st Century\" (Stockholm, SNS, 2016). \n\nEsping-Andersen is professor emeritus at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona (Spain), and member of the Scientific Committee of the Juan March Institute and of the Board of Trustees and the Scientific Council at the IMDEA Social Sciences Institute, both in Madrid (Spain). He is a member of the American Academy of Social Sciences and the British Academy. He was awarded a honoris doctor causa from Copenhagen University in 2012. He is now research professor at Bocconi University in Milano.\n\nHis major, most influential and highly cited book titled \"The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism\" was published in 1990 and it laid out three main types of welfare states, in which modern developed capitalist nations cluster: \n\nIt is important to note that these categories have little to do with the contemporary labels of American politics, and rather have much more to do with general political theory. The traditional examples of the three types of welfare states are the United States (liberal), Germany (corporatist-statist) and Sweden (social democratic).\n\nOther sociologists and political scientists went on to apply his theoretical analysis to the real world. One such example is a book entitled \"Real Worlds of Welfare Capitalism\", written by Robert E. Goodin, Bruce Headey, Ruud Muffels, and Henk-Jan Dirven. While some critics claim Esping-Andersen's categories are becoming outdated, many political scientists are attracted by its intuitive simplicity.\n\nIn the past decade, his research has moved to demographic issues and in particular to the consequences of women's changing roles. He has, most notably, developed a multiple equilibrium framework for the understanding of changing family behaviour. See in particular his 'Families in the 21st Century and Esping-Andersen and Billari (2015) 'Retheorizing family demographic change'. \"Population and Development Review (2015)\"\n\nThe evolving nature of welfare states often makes it difficult to categorize. Arguably, many welfare states have components from some or all typologies, making them more akin to points on a continuum rather than rigid typologies, a fact Esping-Andersen acknowledges in his writings.\n\nAccording to French sociologist, Georges Menahem, Esping-Andersen's \"decommodification index\" aggregates both qualitative and quantitative variables for ”sets of dimensions” which fluid, and pertain to three very different areas. Similarly, Menahem has concerns regarding the validity of the index, and its potential for replication.\n\nIn 1996, the Italian Social Scientist Maurizio Ferrera, further developed Esping-Andersen's Worlds of Welfare by identifying a fourth subtype of the welfare state model, the Southern European Model of Welfare. \n\nEsping-Andersen, Gosta Families in the 21st Century (Stockholm, 2016).\n"}

An earlier study, the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission, was conducted by the colonial authorities in British India in 1893–94. The reports systematically contradicted claims made by the U.S. Treasury Department that smoking marijuana results in insanity, deteriorates physical and mental health, assists in criminal behavior and juvenile delinquency, is physically addictive, and is a \"gateway\" drug to more dangerous drugs.\n\nThe report was prepared by the New York Academy of Medicine, on behalf of a commission appointed in 1939 by New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia who was a strong opponent of the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act. Released in 1944, the report infuriated Harry Anslinger, who was campaigning against marijuana. Anslinger condemned it as unscientific.\n\nAnslinger went on an offensive against what he saw as a \"degenerate Hollywood\" that was promoting marijuana use. After high-profile arrests of actors like Robert Mitchum, Hollywood gave Anslinger full control over the script of any film that mentioned marijuana.\n\nAfter more than five years of research the members of the committee drew up a catalog of 13 salient points with the conclusions they reached.\n\n\nTherefore, according to the LaGuardia Report, the gateway drug theory is without foundation (points 7 and 9).\n\nPublished in 1944, the report offended Harry Anslinger, who branded it as \"unscientific\". Harry Anslinger denounced Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, the New York Academy of Medicine and the doctors who had worked for more than five years on the research. Anslinger said that they should not conduct more experiments or studies on marijuana without his personal permission. Anslinger interrupted, between 1944 and 1945, each current research on derivatives of cannabis, and according to some personally commissioned the American Medical Association to prepare a position which would reflect the one of the government. \n\nThe study conducted by AMA between 1944 and 1945 on Anslinger's personal request, having as objective to disprove the statements of the LaGuardia Report, leveraged again on racism, asserting that \"of the experimental group, thirty-four men were black, and only one was white\", and \"those who smoked marijuana, became disrespectful of white soldiers and officers during military segregation\".\n\nOnly in 1972, the same institutional source that spread the series of scientifically unfounded rumors about the dangers of cannabis admitted that \"these stories were largely false\" and that \"with careful consideration of the documentation there is no confirmation of the existence of a causal relationship between marijuana use and the possible use of heroin\". Thus, it was declared that the ban on cannabis was imposed and still subsisted \"without any serious and comprehensive research had been conducted on the effects of marijuana\".\n\n\n"}

In 1949 a Pittsburgh police superintendent even singled out the sweater girl as a symptom of the moral decline of postwar youth: \nNew, soft fabrics like cashmere and angora were being used to make sweaters. The conical shape bra, sometimes called a bullet bra, raises and separates her breasts. In its original form, the look was often tied to the promotion of new bra technology.\n\nInterest in the bullet bra revived after Madonna wore a cone bra during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour. The bra was designed by Jean Paul Gaultier who was inspired by the vintage Perma-Lift bullet bra of the 1940s. By that time, the style was regarded as erotic and provocative. The bullet bra has also become popular with burlesque and rockabilly enthusiasts, both of which draw inspiration from the 1950s.\n\nLana Turner's appearance in the 1937 film \"They Won't Forget\" in a tight-fitting knit top is sometimes considered the first case of the \"sweater girl\", as Hollywood publicists sought for a catchy phrase to describe the impact she made on the screen. Movie magazines nicknamed her \"The Sweater Girl,\" just as Ann Sheridan was \"The Oomph Girl,\" Dorothy Lamour \"The Sarong Girl,\" and Clara Bow \"The It Girl.\"\n\n\"Sweater Girl\" is the name of a 1942 film written by Robert Blees and Beulah Marie Dix, directed by William Clemens and starring Eddie Bracken, June Preisser, Phillip Terry, and Betty Jane Rhodes.\n\nFrom the 1944 \"Army–Navy Screen Magazine\" #20, a one-reel short that showed portions of a special \"Armed Forces Radio Network\" recording session, Bob Hope introduces \"sweater girl\" Judy Garland. Before she sings \"Over the Rainbow\", they perform a short comic sketch, Judy asking why men are so crazy about sweater girls. Bob says he doesn't know and wisecracks, \"That's one mystery I'd like to unravel\".\n\nIn September 1968 an obscure clerical worker named Francine Gottfried briefly attained international celebrity as \"Wall Street's Sweater Girl\" as large crowds of gawking men and newspaper reporters awaited her arrival at the Wall Street subway stop each morning and mobbed her on her way to work.\n\n"}

{"id": "1921776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921776", "title": "Time and a Word", "text": "Time and a Word\n\nTime and a Word is the second studio album by English rock band Yes, released on 24 July 1970 by Atlantic Records. It was put together several months after the release of the band's 1969 eponymous debut, during which they continued to tour heavily and recorded \"Time and a Word\" during gaps between shows. Yes continued to follow their early musical direction of performing original material and cover versions of songs by pop, jazz, and folk artists. A small orchestra of brass and string session musicians was used on most of the album's songs.\n\nGuitarist Peter Banks did not support the idea of adding an orchestra to the album, resulting in increased tensions between himself and the rest of the group. During their UK tour in April 1970 and before the album's release, Banks was fired from Yes and was replaced by Steve Howe. The UK album cover was considered inappropriate for the American market, so a new photograph of the band was used, putting Howe on the cover of an album on which he did not perform.\n\n\"Time and a Word\" received mixed reviews from critics, but became the band's first release to enter the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number 45; however, it did not chart in the United States. In 2003, the album was remastered with several previously unreleased tracks.\n\nAfter the release of their debut album \"Yes\" in July 1969 for Atlantic Records, Yes resumed extensive touring across the UK. The line-up of the group at this time included lead vocalist Jon Anderson, guitarist Peter Banks, bassist Chris Squire, drummer Bill Bruford, and organist Tony Kaye. Towards the end of 1969, they booked time at Advision Studios in London during gaps between shows to record \"Time and a Word\". In a November 1969 interview during a tour of Switzerland, Bruford talked about the album, saying Anderson was \"pouring out new numbers for us to play ... Usually he writes a tune and we listen to the tape and take it from there\". At Advision, Yes were joined by producer Tony Colton, a friend of Anderson's who was also the singer of the rock band Heads Hands & Feet. Phil Carson, the European managing director of Atlantic and a fan of the band, brought in audio engineer Eddy Offord to assist Colton in the album's production because of his skills and hard work. Offord would become a key figure in the band's history in the 1970s as their producer and live sound mixer.\n\nThe group continued to follow their early musical direction of performing original material and rearranged cover versions of songs by pop, jazz, and folk artists. They followed the same format as \"Yes\"; an album of eight tracks with two covers. A discussion amongst Squire, Anderson, and Colton during the writing process led the decision of incorporating orchestral arrangements into some of their new songs. Anderson wished to use an orchestra as their new ideas needed \"some additional ... sounds\". He observed that Banks and Kaye had not worked together to create a strong sound that their new arrangements required. To attempt to solve this, the group discussed using a Mellotron and tested one out, but the idea fell through. Instead, a brass section of session players and a string section formed of students from the Royal College of Music were hired to perform arrangements written and conducted by Tony Cox.\n\n\"Time and a Word\" was met with \"Yes-style controversy\", as described by band biographer and reporter Chris Welch. Banks became the most outspoken member over his issues surrounding the album which began the strain on his relationship with the rest of the group. He did not support the idea of an orchestra and thought it merely followed what rock bands Deep Purple and the Nice had already done. He argued it merely played parts originally written for the guitar or organ, leaving his active participation to the album a minimum or his guitar buried into the album's mix. Banks also disagreed with the decision to have Colton produce the album and claimed that Colton lacked the experience and personally disliked Banks and his playing. Colton's ability was also questioned by Squire, who recalled one incident during the mixing of \"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\", by which time Banks's replacement Steve Howe had joined and attended; Colton mixed the song using \"a crappy pair of cans that did not reproduce bass\", rather than using the studio's monitoring equipment. Colton asked for more bass, but Squire and Howe noticed the bass levels on the monitors were already high. In 1995, Offord said that he too thought Colton had not been the right person to produce the band at that time.\n\nThe album's six original tracks are credited to Anderson with either Squire or David Foster, Anderson's former bandmate in The Warriors. Banks said he made contributions to the writing of the album, but his name was not included in the credits. It did not bother him at first, but it caused some discontent years later when he missed out on royalties. \"Time and a Word\" marked a development in Anderson's lyric content, who began to move from simple love themes to topics of greater scale, described by band biographer Dan Hedges as \"life, oneness and the future\".\n\n\"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\", the album's first cover song, was written by American artist Richie Havens. It opens with an orchestral theme taken from the soundtrack to the 1958 Western film \"The Big Country\" by Jerome Moross.\n\nAnderson wrote \"The Prophet\" telling the story of a man, followed by many, who tells others to find and believe in themselves and not follow \"like sheep\". The song borrows a theme from \"Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity\" from \"The Planets\" suite by English composer Gustav Holst and shows Anderson incorporating other themes from classical music, to which he listened regularly.\n\n\"Sweet Dreams\" was particularly well-received by future Yes guitarist Trevor Rabin, who requested the band perform the song in concert during the \"90125\" tour in 1984.\n\nThe song \"Time and a Word\" saw the band searching for an anthem-type song. Anderson, who was still musically naive, presented its basic theme to the group on a guitar, using only two or three chords, leaving the other band members trying to discern what he was playing. The song was recorded with Foster on acoustic guitar. Again Banks didn't agree and claimed it was not meant to be part of the final mix, having been intended only as a guide track. On the final version, Banks played his parts over Foster's.\n\nYes also recorded \"Dear Father\" at Advision Studios, but decided not to include the track on the album.\n\nThe sleeve for the album's original UK pressing was designed and photographed by Laurence Sackman and co-ordinated by Graphreaks. The front cover features an artistic black-and-white Dada-esque chequered design featuring a nude woman, while the back cover included photographs of each member in front of a wind machine, distorting their faces. The front cover art was deemed inappropriate by the American record distributors, so Atlantic Records arranged for photographer Barrie Wentzell of Wardour Street, London to take a new photo of the band for use on the US printing. By the time the photograph was taken, Steve Howe had replaced Peter Banks as Yes' guitarist, so Howe appears on the American version of the album cover. However, the back of the US record sleeve is identical to the UK version, so it includes a picture of Banks. Howe has said that the original album cover was rejected because it was sexist, but that he was angry at Atlantic Records for continually printing and selling an album with his photo on the cover even though he did not play on the record.\n\nYes premiered most of \"Time and a Word\" during their two solo concerts at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 21 and 22 March 1970. For the second half, they played songs from the album with a twenty-piece orchestra led by Tony Cox. Anderson later considered the shows a failure, due to a lack of rehearsal time and a poor sound system. To record the orchestra, microphones were left dangling above the players using coat hangers. Banks thought the experiment was a \"daft idea\". Nevertheless, Chris Welch wrote a positive review in \"Melody Maker\" noting that despite the amplification problems, the \"musical break-through\" reaction from the audience suggested to him that the group had \"arrived\". The shows were the last in which Yes performed with an orchestra, until the 2001 Symphonic Tour to support their nineteenth studio album \"Magnification\", which also featured orchestral arrangements.\n\nTensions within the band increased, and just after the album's recording was completed in early 1970, Banks was asked to leave. Steve Howe would join the line-up, as a replacement, that June.\n\nFollowing the UK release of \"Time and a Word\" in July 1970, the album became the group's first to enter the UK Albums Chart, with a peak at number 45. Its US release followed in November 1970. Two singles were released: \"Time and a Word\" in March 1970 and \"Sweet Dreams\" in June 1970. The album sold no more copies than did the debut album \"Yes\", which led management at Atlantic to consider dropping the band from the label. Carson managed to convince them to withdraw the notice, by which time the band had recruited Howe and secured Brian Lane as their new manager.\n\nThe album received a mixed reception. It received an enthusiastic review by Roy Carr in \"New Musical Express\" in August 1970, which hailed it as one of the best releases of the year. To the reviewer, its material was \"mentally exhilirating\", and \"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\" set the standard and mood of the remaining seven tracks. Cox's arrangements were praised, which blended well with the group's ability \"to perform intricate and highly complex ensemble passages with meticulous dexterity and precision\". The review credited the band's instrumental strength from Squire's \"identifiable\" bass playing, which created a \"formidable\" rhythm section when paired with Bruford's \"expertise\" drumming.\n\n\n2003 remaster\nNote: Tracks 9–11 first appeared on early West German CD issues of \"Time and a Word\".\n\nCredits are adapted from the album's 1970 and 2003 liner notes.\n\nYes\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nProduction\n\n"}

Inishbofin has around 180 inhabitants and is a popular tourist destination.\n\nThe island's English name Inishbofin is derived from the Irish name \"Inis Bó Finne\" ('Island of the White Cow'). There are several legends concerning the origins of the island's name. According to one legend, the island was actually a floating place until some fishermen landed on it in a fog. By bringing fire onto the island, they dispelled the magic, fixing it in place. They then saw an old woman driving a white cow, which turned into a rock when the woman struck it with a stick.\n\nThe Irish name has also been anglicised as 'Innisboffin' and 'Boffin' or 'Bophin' island.\n\nInishbofin lies around off the Connemara coast opposite of Ballinakill Harbour and Cleggan Bay. It is separated by a narrow channel from Inishark (Shark island). It is about long and wide. The highest point is in the Westquarter and rises to .\n\nMuch of the island is a Special Area of Conservation (due to the presence of corn crakes and seals). The island has no trees or forests whatsoever. Any wood was cut down and used as heating fuel. Because of the salt-enriched air, trees were never able to re-establish themselves.\n\nIt is not known when Inishbofin was first settled. There is no evidence of a Mesolithic, and only circumstantial evidence of a significant Neolithic presence. Although there are pre-historic field systems, their age has not been definitely established and could be anywhere between Bronze Age and early Medieval. Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments, found in significant numbers on the Connemara mainland, are conspicuous by their absence. Definite traces of human settlement are available only from the Iron Age onwards, such as the remains of promontory ring forts like 'Dun Mor'.\n\nAround 665, Saint Colmán founded a monastery on Inishbofin. According to some accounts, Guairim of Inisbofin was the ruler of the island when Colmán came here. The Annals of the Four Masters report the monastery's Abbots until the early 10th century (see below).\n\nThe island belonged to the O'Flahertys until 1380, when the O'Malleys captured it. In the 16th century, according to local tradition, a Spanish pirate or Barbary corsair named Alonzo Bosco built a stronghold on Port Island, where the Cromwellian fort stands today. According to the tales he raided the Irish coast and shipping in the area. \"Don\" Bosco was supposed to have been an ally of Gráinne O'Malley, chieftain of the O'Malley clan and 'Ireland's pirate queen'. One story had them stretching a defensive iron chain across Inishbofin's harbour entrance to make it impassable to enemy ships. Across the harbour entrance from Port Island sits 'Dún Gráinne', the fort where Gráinne O'Malley supposedly lived.\n\nEventually, Elizabethean forces took the island. In 1609, both Inishbofin and Inishark were the property of the Earl (or Marquis) of Clanricard (alternatively spelled Clanricarde or Clanrickard). The Marquis was of the de Burgo (Burke) family.\nIn the years of war following the Irish rebellion of 1641, the island was an important staging posts for arms deliveries to the Irish Catholic rebels and their allies, the Royalists, from the Duke of Lorraine. The Royalists were supporters of King Charles I of England in the English Civil War against the Parliamentarians. In August 1649, the Parliamentarian forces under Oliver Cromwell had landed in Ireland and over the next few years conquered it. In early 1653, Cromwellian warships threatened to bombard the island and Inishbofin surrendered on 14 February to Sir John Reynolds. It was thus one of the last Royalist strongholds to fall to Cromwell's army. According to some accounts, after Galway had fallen in 1652, Rory O'Moore, one of the initiators of the 1641 rebellion fled to Inishbofin, where he lived in a cave.\n\nAfter taking the island, the mark cunnane Inishbofin into a prison for Catholic priests arrested elsewhere in Ireland. Most of the star fort commanding the harbour dates from this period. It is known today as \"Cromwell's Barracks\" and was used, aside from its role as a prison, to protect the harbour against pirates and Dutch raiders (with whom the Protectorate was at war). At the time, a considerable fishery and whaling activity was based on the island.\n\nIn 1690, the fort was garrisoned during the Williamite War in Ireland by Jacobites, supporters of King James II of England. Commanded by one Colonel O'Riordan, they surrendered to King William's forces soon after the fall of Galway in 1691.\n\nIn 1779, a British ship carrying officers and new recruits of the 84th Regiment of Foot and the King's Orange Rangers, diverted from their planned course from Newfoundland to New York City during the American War of Independence, was blown off course and wrecked at Inishbofin (Royal Oak Cove). 56 of the soldiers died, many of the survivors deserted and were hunted down by troops from Westport.\n\nAround 1830, Inishbofin passed from the possession of the Clanricards to the Browne family of Westport, descendants of the O'Malleys. In 1837, the island was in the Barony of Murrisk, County of Mayo, and Province of Connaught. It belonged to Howe Browne, 2nd Marquess of Sligo.\n\nCirca 1855, George Browne sold the island to Henry William Wilberforce. Cyril Allies, an English Catholic, bought it from Wilberforce in 1876, after having held it in mortgage since 1859. It was eventually acquired by the Congested Districts Board for Ireland (later known as the Land Commission). The exact date is not known, but negotiations were \"well advanced\" by 1910.\n\nAs of 1 February 1873, Inishbofin (as in the Civil Parish of Inishbofin which included Inishark as well) was no longer legally part of County Mayo but had become a part of County Galway. this was a consequence of a severe localised famine in the winter of 1872/3 which necessitated relief be organised via the nearer Poor Law Union based in Clifden Workhouse rather than the previously responsible Poor Law Union based around Louisburgh Workhouse and in view of the particular concentration of distress in West Connemara and Inishbofin/Inishark.\n\nThe table below reports data on Inishbofin's population taken from \"Discover the Islands of Ireland\" (Alex Ritsema, Collins Press, 1999) and the Census of Ireland. Censuses in Ireland before 1841 are not considered complete and/or reliable.\n\nThe island's population has shrunk dramatically since pre-famine times. In 1837, 1462 people lived on Inishbofin. By 1881, the number was down to 959. In 1990, there were around 200 inhabitants, the 2011 Census found just 160 inhabitants.\n\nToday, tourism is the island's main industry. There are three hotels and a hostel on the island. Inishbofin offers scuba diving, walking trails, cycling, horse riding, sailing, paddle boarding, kayaking, snorkelling, shore and sea angling.\n\nInishbofin can be reached by ferry from the pier in Cleggan. There is also a helipad, and an airstrip has been built on the island. However, despite the Inishbofin and Cleggan airfields costing almost EUR10 million to build and continuing to cost hundreds of thousands annually to maintain, neither airstrip is licensed for use and general aviation pilots are forbidden to land on them.\n\nThe island features a football pitch and a community centre with an indoor sports hall. It also houses a small island library which provides a reference and local studies collection with information on the history and heritage of the area. \n\nInishbofin hosted the 2008 All-Ireland Islands Football Tournament, and again in September 2017. The current Galway Senior Men's Football team goalkeeper, Ruairi Lavelle, hails from Inishbofin. Another islander, Michael Day, also made his debut in midfield for the Senior team in 2017.\n\n\nInishbofin was mentioned at some length by Irish artist and author Robert Gibbings, writing in 1946. He also referred in passing to some Inishbofin placenames that appear to be no longer extant, suggesting that the villages have now vanished. These include: Alladoon, Bunamullen, Cooltra, Mweelanbwee, Ooghnagunnel. Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney's poem \"Seeing Things\" begins with a boat ride to Inishbofin. \"Inishbofin on a Sunday Morning. / Sunlight, turfsmoke, seagulls, boatslip, diesel\". The island served as the setting for Deborah Tall's 1987 book, \"The Island of the White Cow\". Richard Murphy wrote several poems about his time on Inishbofin, best known perhaps is' Sailing to an Island'.\n\n\n\n"}

It is named after a knee-shaped water-filled rock hole at the base of Uluru, and is located in the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. Its people are traditional owners and joint managers of the park with Parks Australia. At the 2011 census, Mutitjulu had a population of 296, of which 218 (71.2%) were Aboriginal.\n\nThe majority of the Anangu (people) are Pitjantjatjara but there are also associated Yankunytjatjara, Luritja and Ngaanyatjarra people with the languages spoken being Pitjantjatjara, Luritja and Yankunytjatjara. Arrernte people also have a traditional relationship with Uluru.\n\nMutitjulu community run a number of guided tours for tourists visiting Uluru, who show tourists certain sites, and share Tjukurpa the story of Uluru, as well as of its inhabitants. These tours are called Anangu Tours, from the Pitjantjatjara word Anangu which means \"people\".\n\nAccess to the community is controlled by Anangu, who do not allow visitors to go to Mutitjulu community without permission. The community reserves the right to forbid visitors from entering their land.\n\nThe people of Mutitjulu are also the traditional owners of Uluru, and have an art exhibition there where they sell paintings and other artefacts.\n\nMuch of the economy of Mutitjulu comes from tourism at Uluru and nearby Yulara, a small proportion of which is funnelled back to the local economy. Despite this, Mutitjulu is not wealthier than most other Indigenous Australian communities.\n\nMaruku Arts & Crafts is a large and successful Aboriginal Australian-owned and -operated enterprise, run by Anangu (people of the Western and Central Deserts of Australia) since about 1990. It has a warehouse based in Mutitjulu, a retail gallery at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park Cultural Centre, as well as a market stall in Yulara town square. Its artwork consists mainly of paintings and woodcarvings. With about 900 artists in the collective, it provides an important source of income living in remote communities across central Australia. It seeks to \"keep culture strong and alive, for future generations of artists, and [to] make culture accessible in an authentic way to those that seek a more in-depth understanding\".\n\nMaruku is one of ten Indigenous-owned and -governed enterprises that go to make up the APY Art Centre Collective, established in 2013.\n\nThe community has a school which services students from Year 1 to Year 7, and a high school, Nyangatjatjara College. The cultural traditions of Mutitjulu dictate that once reaching adolescence, children must be taught only with peers of the same sex. Nyangatjatjara College is a boarding school, and hosts the young men and young women of the community separately in consecutive semesters.\n\nAs with housing and health, Anglo-European education standards at Mutitjulu, are far lower than the Australian average.\n\nLanguages spoken are Pitjantjatjara, Luritja and Yankunytjatjara. Communication between the languages, however, is not difficult as most residents speak several languages and these Aboriginal languages are closely related, all being mutually intelligibly varieties of the Western Desert Language.\n\nEfforts are made to preserve traditional customs, including traditional languages, but some English is spoken by most residents. The level of English literacy by Mutitjulu residents is higher than in many Indigenous Australian communities primarily due to the regular exposure to tourists at Uluru.\n\nMany stories have been told by Indigenous Australians from all around Central Australia about Uluru. Some of these stories are recreated in paintings and artwork, and many relate to the dreamtime. Uluru is seen as having an explanation for why we are humans, and the stories help to describe much of the surrounding flora and fauna.\n\nThe local Indigenous community from 1990 requested that visitors respect the sacred status of Uluru by not climbing the rock, with signs posted to this effect in late 1989. In 2017 the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park board decided unanimously to ban the activity, from October 26, 2019.\n\nThe Anangu consider themselves caretakers rather than owners of Uluru. For many years, Uluru was controlled by non-Aboriginal Australians, with motels placed close by. Traditional owners who had been forced out of the national park returned and settled at Mutitjulu, and worked towards restoring their land rights. Tourist facilities have been moved about 24 km north to Yulara, just outside the national park boundary.\n\nTitle to the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park was returned to the traditional owners on 26 October 1985.\n\n"}

Soares would become Prime-Minister again in January 1978, in coalition with the Democratic Social Center, but in July this party would force the end of the government due to disagreements about agrarian reform. In August, Nobre da Costa became Prime-Minister by personal decision of the President of President Ramalho Eanes, after a failed attempt to unite the parties on the Parliament. However, the program of Nobre da Costa's government was never approved and two months later, da Costa was replaced by Mota Pinto who would govern with extreme difficulties for less than one year.\n\nIn July 1979, the President finally decided to dissolve the Parliament and call for a new election for December.

A commercial disappointment upon release, The Aquabats were dropped from Goldenvoice the following year, leading to a lengthy semi-hiatus from touring and recording until the band's 2005 comeback album \"Charge!!\" would renew their popularity.\n\nFollowing the modest commercial success and high-profile tours behind their 1997 album \"The Fury of The Aquabats!\", The Aquabats had begun to feel pigeonholed by their media portrayal as a \"cheesy ska band\", unanimously agreeing to explore newer and more varied musical styles rather than just produce another ska album. As such, \"Floating Eye\" marked a drastic stylistic shift in The Aquabats' sound, almost entirely abandoning the brass-driven ska which had characterized their previous albums in favor of an eclectic mix of guitar- and keyboard-driven rock music strongly influenced by punk rock and new wave, a style the band would continue to develop on their subsequent albums.\n\nHaving written upwards of forty different songs and partial songs for the album, The Aquabats produced approximately thirty tracks during the recording sessions for \"Floating Eye\", only fourteen of which were ultimately included on the album. In November 2000, the band released a companion compilation album, \"Myths, Legends and Other Amazing Adventures, Vol. 2\", featuring the remaining songs not selected for inclusion, while also releasing a large number of unreleased songs and rough demos for free on their website.\n\nThe material recorded for \"Floating Eye\" and \"Myths & Legends\" mark the only Aquabats studio material to feature drummer Dr. Rock, as well as the last to feature guitarist The Mysterious Kyu and co-founding trumpeter Catboy, all of whom would depart from the band prior to the recording of their next studio album. To date, \"Floating Eye\" is the final Aquabats studio album to feature a horn section, as the departure of Catboy in 2002 would persuade the band to move away from the use of brass instruments.\n\nWith the near-complete lack of The Aquabats' formerly marketable ska sound, Goldenvoice Records expressed mixed feelings over \"Floating Eye\", reportedly telling the band that the album had no satisfactory single and would be difficult to promote. In a 2005 interview, bassist Chad Larson retrospectively agreed with this assessment on the album's lack of a commercial sound, noting that while he felt the material was strong, it \"probably wasn't the record we should have put out at that time\". True to the label's predictions, \"Floating Eye\" failed to match the success of \"The Fury\", placing only at number 35 on \"Billboard\"s Top Heatseekers chart. Goldenvoice nevertheless granted the band a budget to shoot a music video, which The Aquabats instead used to film an unsuccessful television pilot entitled \"The Aquabats! In Color!\".\n\nDespite its relatively poor commercial success, critical reception to \"Floating Eye\" was mostly positive. Steve Huey of Allmusic gave \"The Aquabats vs. the Floating Eye of Death!\" a rating of four stars out of five, writing \"Sure, the humor is frothy and avoids substance like the plague, but anybody expecting anything else from a typical third-wave ska album is waging a pointless battle. Better to just hang on and enjoy the ride, because the Aquabats conduct that ride with a panache few other third-wavers can match, and their songwriting skills continue to improve with each record.\"\n\nCoupled with Goldenvoice's ongoing financial troubles at the time as a result of the first Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the disappointing sales of \"Floating Eye\" eventually contributed to The Aquabats' dismissal from the label in 2000, beginning an extended period of relative inactivity which would last the band throughout the early 2000s until they would independently return to recording in 2004, with the EP \"Yo! Check Out This Ride!\", which helped them sign to Nitro Records later in the year.\n\nAll songs written by The Aquabats, except where noted otherwise.\n\n\n"}

He also spoke at TED, giving a lecture on \"Faith versus tradition in Islam\".\n\nMustafa Akyol's articles on Islamic issues, in which he mostly argues against Islamic extremism and terrorism from a Muslim point of view and defends the Islamic faith, have appeared in publications like \"Foreign Affairs\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The Washington Post\", \"The Forward\", \"First Things\", \"The Huffington Post\", \"The Weekly Standard\", \"The Washington Times\", \"The American Enterprise\", \"National Review\", \"FrontPage Magazine\", \"Newsweek\" and \"Islam Online\".\n\nAkyol is also author of the English-language book \"Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case For Liberty\" (W.W. Norton). This, according to the publisher, is \"a desperately needed intellectual basis for the reconcilability of Islam and religious, political, economic, and social freedoms.\" Schwartz critiques the author’s lack of full disclosure regarding his own family’s Turkish history and involvement in politics. He also faults the author for not carefully laying out the facts surrounding Turkish democracy and rushing to conclusions about the country’s AKP political party that are not fully supported by the evidence.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2018, he was a senior visiting fellow at Wellesley College, and since 2018 has been senior fellow at the Cato Institute.\n\nAkyol used to be an outspoken promoter of intelligent design and was identified as a former spokesman for Science Research Foundation (\"Bilim Araştırma Vakfı\"), an Islamic creationist group, started by Adnan Oktar. Akyol later noted that he had ended all his \"cooperation with [Bilim Araştırma Vakfı]... due to some serious disagreements on issues other than intelligent design.\" He was also affiliated with the Discovery Institute. He has testified in the Kansas evolution hearings in favor of introducing Intelligent Design and arranged a government-sponsored Intelligent Design conference in Istanbul. In 2019, he said he changed his mind, noting that \"the theory of evolution is perfectly compatible with the faith.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1921972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1921972", "title": "Democratic Alliance (Portugal)", "text": "Democratic Alliance (Portugal)\n\nThe Democratic Alliance (, AD) was a centre-right conservative political alliance, in Portugal, between the Social Democratic Party (PPD/PSD), the Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) and the People's Monarchist Party (PPM) existing between 1979 and 1983.\n\nThe alliance was composed of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), the Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) and the People's Monarchist Party (PPM), including also a group of dissidents of the right wing of the Socialist Party (PS) who were disappointed by the previous Soares government, called The Reformers, including José Medeiros Ferreira (who would later rejoin the PS), António Barreto (who remained a more or less centre/rightwing aligned independent) and Francisco Sousa Tavares (who joined the Social Democratic Party afterwards). The coalition was first formed in 1979 in order to run to the December 1979 legislative election. The alliance was led by Francisco Sá Carneiro and Freitas do Amaral, and won the 1979 and 1980 legislative elections, which led to Sá Carneiro becoming Prime Minister of Portugal, but lost the presidential election of 1980 to the independent candidate António Ramalho Eanes.\n\nAfter the death of Sá Carneiro on 4 December 1980, the coalition was unable to find a leader with his charisma. Francisco Pinto Balsemão, the incoming PSD leader, became Prime Minister, but was unable to consolidate the support enjoyed by his predecessor. After its defeat in the municipal elections of 1982, it was disbanded in 1983.\n\nMarcelo Rebelo de Sousa led an attempt to establish a new Democratic Alliance in 1998, between the PSD and the People's Party (CDS–PP; the former CDS), led by Paulo Portas. It contested the 2004 European elections as \"Força Portugal\", but was subsequently dissolved. However, both the PSD and CDS–PP later agreed to contest the 2014 European elections under a joint list called the Portugal Alliance.\n\n\n\n"}
