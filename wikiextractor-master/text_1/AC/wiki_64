Originally known for \"bel canto\" performances of Rossini, Donizetti, and Vincenzo Bellini, she was the first non-Italian ever to win the prestigious Bellini d'Oro prize.\n\nSubsequently, she has extended her repertoire to include a wide variety of other roles, including those from the Russian repertoire and works by Richard Strauss. In 2008, Anderson was elevated to \"Commandeur\" of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government and in 2007 received a \"Victoire d'honneur\" at the \"Victoires de la Musique Classique\" in Paris.\n\nAnderson has performed in noted opera houses including La Scala, Covent Garden, La Fenice, Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago and Colón Theater. She has collaborated with conductors Leonard Bernstein, James Levine, Charles Dutoit, Zubin Mehta, Riccardo Muti, Seiji Ozawa, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Kent Nagano and Michael Tilson Thomas.\n\nJune Anderson was born in Boston, Massachusetts and raised in Wallingford, Connecticut. She attended Lyman Hall High School where she was the 5th highest in academic standing among 505 graduates in the class of 1970. She began vocal studies at age 11 and at age 17 was the youngest finalist (at that time) in the Metropolitan Opera auditions.\n\nShe received a degree from Yale University in French, graduating \"cum laude\" and then decided to pursue a career in singing. Anderson studied voice under Robert Leonard in New York City. She had numerous auditions but no engagements at first. She has said that she continued her pursuit as a challenge, giving herself a deadline of two years (after which she would, if unsuccessful, enter law school). \"No one wanted to know my name. I was down to my last $50. That's when I decided I was going to be a singer if it killed me!\"\n\nAnderson sang in several productions in the Yale/New Haven area while still a high school student. In 1968, she sang in a production of Haydn's \"L'infedeltà delusa\" at Yale University. In 1970 she appeared as Gilda with the New Haven Opera Company in a production of Verdi's \"Rigoletto\".\n\nShe made her professional opera debut as the Queen of the Night in Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\" at the New York City Opera in 1978.\nSeveral years later, she would voice the Queen of the Night in the Oscar-winning \"Amadeus\", directed by Miloš Forman. While at New York City Opera, she sang in a wide range of operas including \"The Golden Cockerel\" by Rimsky-Korsakov, \"Rigoletto\" and \"La Traviata\" by Verdi, Rossini's \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\", \"Giulio Cesare\" by Handel, and Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" (as Elvira). In 1981, she sang the three lead soprano roles in \"Les Contes d'Hoffmann\" by Jacques Offenbach, the first soprano to do so at New York City Opera since Beverly Sills in 1973.\n\nAnderson left New York City Opera in 1982 and embarked on a European career. Anderson's career in this decade was marked by numerous debuts in quintessential \"bel canto\" roles in major European opera houses. She also participated in the recording of operatic works rarely heard in this era, including: Rossini's \"Mosè in Egitto\", Wagner's \"Die Feen\", Bizet's \"La jolie fille de Perth\", Adolphe Adam's \"Le postillon de Lonjumeau\", Fromental Halévy's \"La Juive\", and Daniel Auber's \"La muette de Portici\".\n\nAfter being recommended to an Italian agent by Sherrill Milnes, she made her European performance debut in 1982 in the title role of Rossini's \"Semiramide\" in Rome. In 1983, Anderson debuted in Florence and Geneva in the title role of \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" by Donizetti, a part which became one of her most frequent portrayals. She also sang \"Die Feen\" by Wagner in Munich, and appeared in North America: Bellini's \"I puritani\" in Edmonton and \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\" in Seattle.\n\nIn 1984, she performed her first Amina in Vincenzo Bellini's \"La sonnambula\" in Venice, opening 135 years to the day after Maria Malibran's final Amina in that same theatre. She also appeared as Marie in \"La fille du régiment\" by Donizetti in Parma. In 1985, Anderson debuted as Isabelle in the historic revival of \"Robert le Diable\" by Meyerbeer in Paris. That year she also appeared in a rarely seen Verdi work, \"La battaglia di Legnano\", in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn 1986, she performed her first Desdemona in Rossini's \"Otello\" in Venice. The same year, she made her debut at La Scala in Milan in \"La sonnambula\", and her debut at Covent Garden in productions of \"Semiramide\" and \"Lucia di Lammermoor\". She also appeared in \"La fille du régiment\" at the Opéra-Comique in Paris.\n\nAnderson returned to the Opéra-Comique in 1987, appearing as Elvira in Bellini's \"I Puritani\", and gave a recital at the Paris Opera with Alfredo Kraus. In Italy, she returned to La Scala for her debut as Giuletta in \"I Capuleti e i Montecchi\" and returned to Venice for her first performance of \"Beatrice di Tenda\", also by Bellini.\n\nAnderson also appeared in a 1988 concert version of \"Beatrice di Tenda\" at Carnegie Hall, with the Opera Orchestra of New York. \nElsewhere in 1988, Anderson focused on Rossini roles: playing her first \"Armida\" in Aix-en-Provence, appearing in \"Otello\" at the Pesaro Festival, and debuting as Anna in \"Maometto II\" (an early version of Rossini's \"Le siège de Corinthe\") at the San Francisco Opera (she had previously recorded this work with Samuel Ramey in 1983). She also appeared that year in \"Luisa Miller\" by Verdi at the Opéra National de Lyon. In 1989, she made her long-awaited debut at New York's Metropolitan Opera as Gilda in \"Rigoletto\", with Luciano Pavarotti. The \"New York Times\" review wrote of her Met debut:Miss Anderson's debut as Gilda, although belated, could not have been more welcome. The Metropolitan is not rich in artists of this caliber. The tall soprano left America a decade ago to build a phenomenal European career, chiefly in the florid works of Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini. She demonstrated in a \"Caro nome\" of exquisite taste, effortless fluidity and pinpoint precision that she is a master of the bel canto style. She is comfortable above high C, but the lower ranges do not suffer in quality or power. The wide leaps of the \"Caro nome\" coda were taken effortlessly and squarely on the note. The Met audience does not often hear a trill as thrushlike and as precise as Miss Anderson's, nor a soprano who can soar as grandly over the ensemble in the quartet.\n\nIn July 1989, she sang at the inaugural gala of the new Opéra Bastille in Paris, performing \"Ombre légère\" from \"Le pardon de Ploërmel\", by Meyerbeer. (Not a fan of the modernist space, Anderson was later quoted as saying, \"The place looks like a gymnasium.\" )\n\nLeonard Bernstein selected her to perform as Cunegonde in a December 13, 1989 London concert version of \"Candide\" conducted by the composer (for which she later shared an award for Best Classical Album at the 34th annual Grammy Awards (1992), given for the December 1989 Abbey Road Studios recording by the same cast and conductor).\n\nTwelve days later, again with Bernstein, she appeared in Berlin for a Christmas Day performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D minor \"Choral\" at the Schauspielhaus, celebrating the fall of the Berlin Wall. The December 25, 1989 concert was broadcast live in more than twenty countries to an estimated audience of 100 million people, and was performed by an orchestra and chorus made up of many nationalities: from Germany, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, the Chorus of the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, and members of the Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden; from the Soviet Union, members of the Orchestra of the Kirov Theatre, from the United Kingdom, members of the London Symphony Orchestra; from the USA, members of the New York Philharmonic, and from France, members of the Orchestre de Paris.\n\nIn the next decade, Anderson continued to pursue traditional \"bel canto\" roles, but also expanded her repertoire. Anderson began with a January 1990 performance of the Berlioz song cycle \"Les nuits d'été\" at Carnegie Hall, with Giuseppe Sinopoli conducting London's Philharmonia Orchestra. Later that year, she appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in an opulent production of Rossini's \"Semiramide\", with Marilyn Horne and Samuel Ramey. In 1990, Anderson also performed in Pesaro in a production of the rarely seen \"Ricciardo e Zoraide\", also by Rossini, and visited the Lyric Opera of Chicago in a new production of \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" directed by Andrei Şerban. She closed 1990 with her New Year's Eve gala concert with Zubin Mehta and the New York Philharmonic broadcast nationwide on \"Live from Lincoln Center\" on PBS.\n\nIn February 1991, she returned to Carnegie Hall to perform \"La sonnambula\" with the Opera Orchestra of New York. Also in 1991, she participated in the Gala celebrating the Silver Anniversary of the \"new\" house of Metropolitan Opera, performing \"Je suis Titania\" from \"Mignon\", conducted by James Levine. She also sang with Pavarotti at a gala concert in Teatro Valli in Reggio Emilia, Italy to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his first stage appearance.\n\nIn 1992, she created her first Elena in \"La donna del lago\" at La Scala, the house's first production of the opera in 150 years, staged to mark the bicentenary of Rossini's birth. That same year, she appeared in a controversial new production of \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" at the Metropolitan Opera staged by Francesca Zambello. Edward Rothstein wrote in \"The New York Times\":\n\n[S]ome of the audience's outrage may have been due to the contrast between the staging and the many musical virtues that survived in the performance, which was the most complete version of the score ever presented at the Met. June Anderson -- who must have had black-and-blue arms by the evening's end, so often was she grabbed and tossed about -- sang Lucia with more and more refined empathy as the opera proceeded...She delivered a mad scene that combined virtuosic control with a lovely, haunting innocence.\nThe following year, Anderson appeared as Maria in Tchaikovsky's \"Mazeppa\", in a concert performance at Carnegie Hall with the Opera Orchestra of New York. In 1993, she also appeared in Verdi's \"La traviata\" at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Of that performance, the \"Chicago Tribune\" critic wrote:\nThe show belongs, of course, to Violetta Valery. Anderson quite simply has done nothing finer for Lyric Opera. She internalized every emotion of the role with her usual intensity and conviction, from desperate gaiety to startled joy at her first stirrings of love for Alfredo, right on through to her deathbed scene, which tugged mightily at the heartstrings of even the most jaded opera-goers Every dramatic gesture seemed careful thought out, yet nothing appeared mannered or merely gratuitous. . . .[H]er fiorature were uniformly true, she was able to project easily throughout the theater even when singing softly (how beautifully she floated the bel canto line of \"Addio, del passato\", giving us both verses of the aria), and she commanded the audience's sympathy like the canny singing actress she is. Anderson's Violetta lives up to the great Lyric tradition.\nAnderson began 1995 by appearing in Paris with Roberto Alagna in another controversial production of \"Lucia di Lammermoor\", staged by Andrei Şerban and designed by William Dudley. While the \"International Herald Tribune\" noted that Şerban and Dudley were greeted by a \"chorus of boos\", it wrote of Anderson's performance:[T]here were nothing but cheers for the impressive cast. June Anderson is surely the Lucia of the moment, and although she lent herself heroically to the frenetic demands of the staging, she also sang the role with superb possession of her vocal means and understanding of the psychological subtext.\nLater in 1995, Anderson returned to the Metropolitan Opera in a new production of \"La fille du régiment\" with Pavarotti, of which \"The New York Times\" wrote:\nMs. Anderson's take on Marie is a legitimate one. Winsome charm is at a minimum; tomboy toughness takes over. The role is, of course, one of the coloratura soprano's richest gold mines. Ms. Anderson takes its long series of hurdles with courage, adventure and cool beauty of singing. Wearing a uniform as well as she does is no small help to the evening.\nAfter appearing as Desdemona in Rossini's \"Otello\" for many years, in 1995 Anderson debuted in the same role in Verdi's \"Otello\" in Los Angeles, opposite Plácido Domingo. She also created her first Lucrezia in Verdi's \"I due Foscari\" at Covent Garden and ended the year with her debut as Rosalinde in \"Die Fledermaus\" at the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nIn 1996, Anderson portrayed Joan of Arc in Verdi's \"Giovanna d'Arco\", both in concert versions in New York and Barcelona, and in a stage production at Covent Garden. She returned to Tchaikovsky in 1996, portraying her first Tatiana in \"Eugene Onegin\" in Tokyo. She also appeared in \"La Traviata\", alongside the Italian tenor Salvatore Fisichella, in Tokyo that same year. She participated in the Gala celebrating James Levine's 25th Anniversary at the Metropolitan Opera, singing with Carlo Bergonzi and Ferruccio Furlanetto a selection from \"I Lombardi alla prima crociata\", a work she recorded in its entirety with Levine, Luciano Pavarotti, Samuel Ramey and the Metropolitan Opera orchestra that same year.\n\nIn 1997, Anderson made her first appearance in Vincenzo Bellini's \"Norma\" at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. The \"Chicago Tribune\" noted that Anderson's \"clear, bright upper range was at its clarion best, the soprano singing with strength and nuanced sensitivity\" and hailed her acting as well: \"[D]ramatically, Anderson was exceptional, drawing out all of the conflicting emotions with an intensity tempered by dignity.\" Later in 1997, she returned to the Opera Orchestra of New York to portray her first Elvira in Verdi's \"Ernani.\" In 1998, Anderson spoke in \"Opera News\" of her move away from light coloratura roles \"into deeper water\":I wanted to put it off as long as possible. I kept saying, and it's been quoted so many times, I didn't want to do \"Normina.\" I wanted to do Norma. And Leonora. I didn't want to sound like a soubrette trying to do these things. I've done things like Il Corsaro and La Battaglia di Legnano very early in my career, so Verdi's always been a presence. I did mostly Rigolettos and Traviatas, and then I added Desdemona a few years ago. ... So I suppose Leonora would be next in line.\"\n\nIndeed, in 1998, Anderson played her first Leonora in Verdi's \"Il trovatore\" at the Metropolitan Opera, in a cast including Richard Margison and Dolora Zajick.\n\nIn recent years, Anderson has returned occasionally to her prior roles – appearing in \"Lucia\" in São Paulo in 2000 and Athens in 2002, \"La traviata\" at the Metropolitan Opera in 2001, and new productions of \"La sonnambula\" (Opéra de Marseille, 2004) and \"Maometto II\" (Bilbao, 2005). She continues to appear as \"Norma\", in Parma in and Teatro Colón 2001, and at the Opéra de Marseille and the Canadian Opera Company in 2006. Of that latter performance, Toronto's \"The Globe and Mail\" wrote: Bel canto is a term too often bandied about, but it does mean what it says: beautiful singing, but beautiful as distinct from merely pretty; beautiful not only in its musical sensitivity and accuracy of pitch in the face of extreme vocal challenges devised by the composer, but also in its penetration and detailed communication of the emotions encompassed in the music and drama. It was all this that June Anderson's Norma comprehended and conveyed. . . .\nAnderson, [] also, as a bonus, looked the part: feminine, classy and dignified. I doubt there's been a markedly better Norma since Callas and Sutherland.\nThe \"Toronto Star\" wrote of Anderson's portrayal in \"Norma\":[T]he title role is a jewel for any soprano diva's crown. . . .And how very special that one of the great contemporary Normas, American soprano June Anderson, is present to bring down the house. . . . Anderson, a late addition to the cast, has a remarkable dramatic presence. . . Anderson captures the full conflict that besets Norma...The American soprano also captures the role's intimate side, first shown in the famous aria \"Casta diva\", which invokes the goddess of the moon. Anderson alone is worth the price of admission.\nAnderson continues to claim new territory as well, with debut performances in Donizetti's \"Anna Bolena\" (Pittsburgh 2000) and \"Le convenienze ed inconvenienze teatrali\" (Monte Carlo 2004), \"The Bassarids\" by Hans Werner Henze (Théâtre du Châtelet, 2005), Rossini's \"Il viaggio a Reims\" (Monte Carlo 2005), and the Richard Strauss operas \"Capriccio\" (Naples 2002) and \"Daphne\" (La Fenice 2005). Of her debut in \"Daphne\" a reviewer in \"Opera\" magazine wrote:\n\nThe performance seemed to me an absolute triumph for June Anderson. At a career stage where she could reasonably be expected to scale down effort, ambition and new projects, she has instead taken the admirable decision to continue expanding her artistic range - as this first-ever Daphne (follow-up to her recent first ever Capriccio Countess) demonstrated... [T]he singing offered countless ravishments: crystalline timbre, clean-cut line-delineation, dead-on-target intonation, awesomely easy projection of one perilously exposed high phrase after another.\nIn 2007, Anderson performed Verdi's \"Requiem\" in Paris with conductor Christoph Eschenbach and the Orchestre de Paris, \"Norma\" in Leipzig, and at galas at La Fenice in Venice (June 2007), and the Odeon of Herodes Atticus in Athens (July 2007) honoring the 30th anniversary of the death of Maria Callas. She appeared as Anna Bolena in Bilbao in October 2007, and ended the year with Verdi's \"Requiem\" in Manchester and at St. Paul's Cathedral in London.\n\nIn January 2008, Anderson was elevated from \"Officier\" to \"Commandeur\" of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government, the highest level of commendation within the Ordre recognizing \"eminent artists and writers, as well as individuals who have contributed to the recognition of French culture in the world.\" Her 2008 schedule included recitals and concerts in Aix-en-Provence, Brussels, Bordeaux, Paris, a performance with conductor Kent Nagano and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, at the Bel Canto Festival in Québec, and a Christmas concert in Geneva. In 2009, Anderson appeared in the title roles of \"Norma\" at Teatro Verdi in Trieste, Italy (February - March 2009), and \"Lucrezia Borgia\" at Opéra Royal de Wallonie in Liège, Belgium (June 2009).\n\nIn the 2010-11 season, June Anderson added two new roles to her repertoire: Madame Lidoine, in Dialogues des Carmelites at the Opéra de Nice, and \"Salome (opera)\" at the Opéra Royal de Wallonie. Her 2012 schedule included a further role debut as Pat Nixon in John Adams' \"Nixon in China\" at the Théâtre du Châtelet.\n\nRecordings include:\n\nVincenzo Bellini\n\nGioachino Rossini\n\nGaetano Donizetti\n\nGiuseppe Verdi\n\nLeonard Bernstein\n\nOther composers/recordings\n\n"}

He also wrote essays, worked as an editor, and was a publisher of short-lived newspapers and literary journals. He is best known for his novel \"The Blacker the Berry: A Novel of Negro Life\" (1929), which explores discrimination within the black community based on skin color, with lighter skin being more highly valued.\n\nThurman was born in Salt Lake City to Beulah and Oscar Thurman. When Thurman was less than a month old, his father abandoned his wife and son. It was not until Wallace was 30 years old that he met his father. Between his mother's many marriages, Wallace and his mother lived in Salt Lake City with Emma Jackson, his maternal grandmother. Jackson ran a saloon from her home, selling alcohol without a license.\n\nThurman's early life was marked by loneliness, family instability and illness. He began grade school at age six in Boise, Idaho, but his poor health eventually led to a two-year absence from school, during which he returned to his grandmother Emma in Salt Lake City. From 1910 to 1914, Thurman lived in Chicago. Moving with his mother, he finished grammar school in Omaha, Nebraska. During this time, he suffered from persistent heart attacks. While living in Pasadena, California in the winter of 1918, Thurman caught influenza during the worldwide Influenza Pandemic. He recovered and returned to Salt Lake City, where he finished high school.\n\nThurman was a voracious reader. He enjoyed the works of Plato, Aristotle, Shakespeare, Havelock Ellis, Flaubert, Charles Baudelaire and many others. He wrote his first novel at the age of 10. He attended the University of Utah from 1919 to 1920 as a pre-medical student. In 1922 he transferred to the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, but left without earning a degree.\n\nWhile in Los Angeles, he met and befriended the writer Arna Bontemps, and became a reporter and columnist for a black-owned newspaper. He started a magazine, \"Outlet\", intended to be a West Coast equivalent to \"The Crisis\", operated by the NAACP.\n\nIn 1925 Thurman moved to Harlem. During the next decade, he worked as a ghostwriter, a publisher, and editor, as well as writing novels, plays, and articles. In 1926, he became the editor of \"The Messenger\", a socialist journal addressed to blacks. There he was the first to publish the adult-themed stories of Langston Hughes. Thurman left the journal in October 1926 to become the editor of \"World Tomorrow,\" which was owned by whites. The following month, he collaborated in founding the literary magazine \"Fire!! Devoted to the Younger Negro Artists.\" Among its contributors were Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Bruce Nugent, Aaron Douglas, and Gwendolyn B. Bennett.\n\nHe was able to publish only one issue of \"Fire!!\". It challenged such figures as W. E. B. Du Bois and African Americans who had been working for social equality and racial integration. Thurman criticized them for believing that black art should serve as propaganda for those ends. He said that the New Negro movement spent too much energy trying to show white Americans that blacks were respectable and not inferior.\n\nThurman and others of the \"Niggerati\" (the deliberately ironic name he used for the young African American artists and intellectuals of the Harlem Renaissance) wanted to show the real lives of African Americans, both the good and the bad. Thurman believed that black artists should fully acknowledge and celebrate the arduous conditions of African American lives. As Singh and Scott wrote,\n\nThurman's Harlem Renaissance is, thus, staunch and revolutionary in its commitment to individuality and critical objectivity: the black writer need not pander to the aesthetic preferences of the black middle class, nor should he or she write for an easy and patronizing white approval.\n\nDuring this time, Thurman's flat in a rooming house, at 267 West 136th Street in Harlem, became the central meeting place of African-American literary avant-garde and visual artists. Thurman and Hurston mockingly called the room \"Niggerati Manor.\" He had painted the walls red and black, which were the colors he used on the cover of \"Fire!!\" Nugent painted murals on the walls, some of which contained homoerotic content.\n\nIn 1928, Thurman was asked to edit a magazine called \"Harlem: A Forum of Negro Life\"; its contributors included Alain Locke, George Schuyler, and Alice Dunbar-Nelson. He put out only two issues. Afterward, Thurman became a reader for a major New York publishing company, the first African American to work in such a position.\n\nThurman married Louise Thompson on August 22, 1928. The marriage lasted only six months. Thompson said that Wallace was a homosexual and refused to admit it. They had no children together.\n\nThurman died at the age of 32 from tuberculosis, which many suspect was exacerbated by his long fight with alcoholism.\n\nLangston Hughes described Thurman as \"...a strangely brilliant black boy, who had read everything and whose critical mind could find something wrong with everything he read.\" Thurman's dark skin color attracted comment, including negative reactions from both black and white Americans. He used such colorism in his writings, attacking the black community's preference for its lighter-skinned members.\n\nThurman wrote a play, \"Harlem\", which debuted on Broadway in 1929 to mixed reviews. The same year his first novel \"The Blacker the Berry: A Novel of Negro Life\" (1929) was published. The novel is now recognized as a groundbreaking work of fiction because of its focus on intra-racial prejudice and colorism within the black community, where lighter skin has historically been favored.\n\nThree years later Thurman published \"Infants of the Spring\" (1932), a satire of the themes and the individuals of the Harlem Renaissance. He co-authored his final novel, \"The Interne\" (1932), with Abraham L. Furman, a white man.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2136788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2136788", "title": "Stigmatized property", "text": "Stigmatized property\n\nIn real estate, stigmatized property is property that buyers or tenants may shun for reasons that are unrelated to its physical condition or features. These can include death of an occupant, murder, suicide, and belief that a house is haunted. \n\nControversy exists regarding the definitions of stigma and what sorts of stigma must be disclosed at sale. It is argued that the seller has a duty to disclose any such history of the property. This, in practice, falls into two categories: demonstrable (physical) and emotional. Local jurisdictions vary widely in their interpretation of these issues and occasionally contradict federal law.\n\nMany jurisdictions recognize several forms of stigmatized property, and have passed resolutions or statutes to deal with them. One issue that separates them is disclosure. Depending on the jurisdiction of the house, the seller may not be required to disclose the full facts. Some specific types must always be disclosed, others are up to the jurisdiction, and still others up to the realtor.\n\nThe types of stigma include:\n\n\nAt least in the United States, the principle of \"caveat emptor\" (\"let the buyer beware\") was held for many years to govern sales. As the idea of an implied warranty of habitability began to find purchase, however, issues like the stigma attached to a property based on acts, \"haunting\", or criminal activity began to make their way into legal precedents.\n\nIn \"Stambovsky v. Ackley\" the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, affirmed a narrow interpretation of the idea of stigmatized property. The court held that since the property in question was previously marketed by the seller as a \"haunted house\" he was estopped from claiming the contrary. The majority opinion specifically noted that the veracity of the claims of paranormal activities were outside the purview of the opinion. Notwithstanding these conclusions, the court affirmed the dismissal of the fraudulent misrepresentation action and stated that the realtor was under no duty to disclose the haunting to potential buyers.\n\nA previous version of this article stated that serious illness (such as AIDS) is also a reason a property may become stigmatized, citing a Florida law that contradicts federal law. However, under federal fair-housing laws, persons with AIDS are considered handicapped and members of a protected class. The fact that an occupant of a property has AIDS does not require disclosure to a prospective buyer. \n\nSeveral states have created specific statutes in the US adding \"stigmatised property\" verbiage to their legal code.\n\nFamous homes, such as those used in television productions or filmmaking, can also be stigmatized by increased traffic from fans wanting to see the house in person. One example is the house at 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, New York where Ronald DeFeo, Jr. murdered his family, later made famous by best-selling book \"The Amityville Horror\" and numerous film adaptations. The Lutz family claimed the house was haunted by evil spirits who drove them out. Their claims are supported by paranormal investigators such as Ed and Lorraine Warren and Hans Holzer, but dismissed as fraudulent by skeptics such as Robert Carroll. Since the film's release, the house has been renovated and the address changed in an attempt to prevent sightseers from disturbing the neighborhood.\n\n\n"}

Engineering technology facilities and workshops are based in the block, as well as the Graphic Design rooms.\nE Block\n\nThe Errington Block, which was named after an ex-governor of the college, holds additional classrooms for Language, Sociology, Psychology, Business Studies, Child Care, Key Skills and GCSE courses. Each room is fitted with digital projectors and computers.\n\nSports Centre\n\nThe sports centre holds all main functions regarding sports, and also contains a Fitness Suite which is opened to the public and college staff during the day and after college hours. The sports centre is also home to the National Volleyball League's New Forest Volleyball Club\n\nThe Hard Brock Café\n\nThe Hard Brock Café is a main social attraction for many college students and also holds the offices of the Students' Union. The café provides hot and cold meals, quick snacks, drinks and ice creams.\n\nLRC (Learning Resources Centre)\n\nThe LRC was originally the college main hall and is now the main study area for students at Brock. The LRC has a small library containing a wide selection of course books and relevant course DVDs and CDs, as well as a wide selection of magazines from the NME to The Economist. As well as this on the top floor is an ILT Suite. In this building there is also reprographics and private study rooms.\n\nSTEM Centre / T Block\n\nThe STEM Centre was constructed from 2015–2016 and replaced most of the portable classrooms which formed H Block. Funding partly came from the M3 Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP). The centre contains computer suites, study and social space, plus the Mathematics department on the first floor.\n\nPupil teachers' centre 1909–1921\n\nBrockenhurst College began its existence in 1909 as a pupil teachers' centre – a school where girls from age 13 learned to be teachers. The classes were held in the Wesleyan Church Sunday School, with only 18 children attending under the head mistress, Miss Moore. Although classes were first held in the church Sunday school, Brockenhurst never had any religious affiliation or received any funding from ecclesiastical authorities. It was always funded by the Hampshire Education Authority, and the Sunday school room was used simply because it offered suitable accommodation. Between 1913 and 1935 the school moved location twice and changed head mistress to Miss Emma Clara Ward. During this time the school increased further with more problems continuing for teaching space.\n\nCounty school 1921–1939\n\nTaking in both boys and girls, the school was still expanding further with more pupils joining, by now numbering 150. Along with this the education board granted more funding and further building work; this was followed by a new hall, kitchen and a woodwork room. Miss Ward died in October 1935 to be replaced by the former head of Farnborough Grammar School, Mr R H May.\n\nCounty High School 1939–1950\n\nThe school by this time had grown even further to a high school enrolling 400 students and as young as eleven.\n\nGrammar school 1950–1953\n\nIn 1950 the headmaster decided that the school should be turned into a grammar school and students would therefore have to pass the 11-plus to join. At this stage the school was still taking in both sexes and was resisting the change wanted by the local community. It was also at this time that the headmaster changed Brock's motto to what it is today without any warning to staff or pupils. The motto in the early 50s was \"Manners Makyth Man\", borrowed from Winchester College (the school song \"Forty Years On\" was borrowed from Harrow). The new motto \"Inter Silvas Quaerere Verum\" (Seek Truth [or Learning] Amongst the Trees), an adaptation from Horace's Epistles, refers to the school's location in the New Forest. In spite of the borrowings from boys' public schools it is said that Dr Wood, formerly of Bedales school, accepted the post of Headmaster only on the condition that Brockenhurst remained co-educational rather than becoming boys only as had been proposed.\n\nCounty High School (again) 1953–1960\n\nIn 1953 the headmaster made another unexpected decision changed the name back to a high school. The name remained for seven years until the Hampshire Education Authority sanctioned the change to a grammar school.\n\nGrammar school 1960–1970\n\nFinally the name of grammar school remained for the following ten years after being reinstated by the Education Authority.\n\nCollege 1970–\n\nThe school was converted into a college in 1969, leaving all the surrounding schools to continue lower school education in the area, and became a tertiary college in 1985.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Often a freestyler will need little more than a board and a smooth, flat surface. Music and choreography have always been an essential part of the professional freestyle routine.\n\nFreestyle in the 1950s was created by members of the surfing culture who thought an alternative during times when conditions were not conducive to surfing—surfers would imitate their water-based maneuvers on skateboards when ocean conditions were poor. In the 1960s, many freestyle tricks were derived from gymnastics and dancing.\n\nThe following two decades were defined by a progression towards technical, fluid, and more creative routines. Influential freestyle skateboarders of the 1970s and 1980s included Russ Howell, Rodney Mullen, Joe Humeres and Per Welinder. The style changed significantly in the 1980s, when ollies and ollie-based flip tricks were invented and introduced to the discipline, with Mullen playing a significant role in this process.\n\nIn the 21st century, the style has, to an extent, been incorporated into street skateboarding through skateboarders such as Mullen, Kilian Martin, and Darryl Grogan. The mainstream skateboarding media remains focused on street and \"vert\" (a style of skateboarding that involves skateboarding on a vertical \"u\"-shaped ramp) styles of skateboarding; however, freestyle has been covered by magazines that focus on other \"alternative\" skateboarding styles, such as bowl, slalom and longboarding.\n\n“California Amateur Skateboard League” was founded in 1982, by Frank Hawk with the help of two other “skater parents”, Sonja Catalano & Jeanne Hoffmann. C.A.S.L. is where most of the top professional skateboarders from around the world started competing and is still run today. In 1995, professional freestyle skateboarder Stefan \"Lillis\" Åkesson started the International Network for Flatland Freestyle Skateboarding (INFFS) and, with Daniel Gesmer, produced Flatline and the online version Flatline Online. Following the inception of these initiatives, freestyle skateboarders connected and interacted on a global scale in a manner that had not been experienced previously. The World Freestyle Skateboard Association (WFSA) was then founded by Bob Staton, Åkesson, and Gesmer in the year 2000, thereby attracting further interest in freestyle skateboarding.\n\n\n"}

The Front drew many of its members from amongst the officer class and veterans thereof, groups with which Borghese was already closely linked, and co-operated closely with the Stefano Delle Chiaie's \"Avanguardia Nazionale\" and Pino Rauti's \"Ordine Nuovo\", even sharing members with both groups. With a nationwide structure and a network of funding from business sources the Front soon had a few thousand members and even set up underground \"B groups\" to prepare the ground for an armed uprising.\n\nThe Front's mission was fulfilled in the Golpe Borghese, a failed coup attempt launched in December 1970, with the group disappearing soon afterwards. Like its close cousin in the National Vanguard the party was proved to have been promoting terrorism and to have been infiltrated by the Italian intelligence agencies which used it as a recruiting ground for expendable pawns to be used in 'wet' and 'dirty' operations which would have been outside their jurisdiction or supposed ethics (see strategy of tension).\n"}

{"id": "2136810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2136810", "title": "Veedon Fleece", "text": "Veedon Fleece\n\nVeedon Fleece is the eighth studio album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, released in October 1974. Morrison recorded the album shortly after his divorce from wife Janet (Planet) Rigsbee. With his broken marriage in the past, Morrison visited Ireland on holiday for new inspiration, arriving on 20 October 1973 (with his fiancée at the time, Carol Guida). While there he wrote, in fewer than three weeks, the songs included on the album (except \"Bulbs\", \"Country Fair\" and \"Come Here My Love\").\n\nIt has been compared to \"Astral Weeks\" (1968) with the same \"stream of consciousness\" lyrics but musically it is more Celtic, acoustic and heavily influenced by Morrison's Irish trip. It has been called a genuinely underground album that he seemed to disown quickly after recording and has been referred to as Morrison's \"forgotten masterpiece\".\n\nDuring the summer months of 1973, Morrison had embarked on a three-month tour with his eleven-piece band, the Caledonia Soul Orchestra. Although the resulting concerts and live album, \"It's Too Late to Stop Now\", have come to be known as a performing high for Morrison, the tour was physically and emotionally exhausting. Morrison decided afterwards to take a vacation break, returning to Ireland after a six-year absence obtensibly to record an RTÉ national TV show. Having gone through divorce proceedings earlier in the year, Morrison was now accompanied by his new fiancée, Carol Guida. The vacation visit lasted nearly three weeks during which time he only toured the southern part of the island and did not venture into his native Northern Ireland as the province was engulfed in the Troubles.\n\nIn 1978, Morrison recalled that he recorded the songs about four weeks after writing them: \"\"Veedon Fleece\" was a bunch of songs that I wrote and then I just recorded it about four weeks after I wrote it. When you make an album you write some songs; you might have four songs and maybe you write two more, suddenly you've got enough songs for an album.\" According to the drummer Dahaud Shaar, the tracks were laid down in a very informal manner: \"During that time I kinda haunted the studio, and Van would come in and we'd just do tracks.\" David Hayes recalled about the recording sessions: \"Every night for about a week he came in with two or three new tunes and we just started playing with him.\" Jim Rothermel also recalled that during the California recording sessions for the album the songs were often a first take and that the band members had sometimes not heard the songs previously. The strings and woodwinds were arranged by Jef Labes in a New York studio. The song \"Come Here My Love\" was inspired during the week of the sessions and another song \"Country Fair\" was left over from the \"Hard Nose the Highway\" album and provided a fitting sense of closure. \"Bulbs\" and \"Cul de Sac\" were recut in New York later with musicians with whom Morrison had never worked before: guitarist John Tropea, bassist Joe Macho and drummer Allen Schwarzberg. Given a rock music treatment, these songs were released as the single for the album.\"\n\nThe songs, as recorded on the album, were influenced by his vacation trip to Ireland in 1973; it was his first visit since he left Belfast in 1967. (At this time his parents had moved to California and resided near him.) According to biographer Erik Hage: \"\"Veedon Fleece\" from a lyrical standpoint, shows maturity, renewed poetical confidence, and a direct nod to actual literary influences.\" Hage further comments that musically it \"can be seen as a companion album to \"Astral Weeks\". The soft and complex musical textures (often augmented by flute) of this album are the closest he will ever again get to that vaunted 1968 album.\"\n\nThe opening track, \"Fair Play\" derived its name from Morrison's Irish friend, Donall Corvin's repeated use of the Irish colloquialism \"fair play to you\" as a wry compliment. It's a 3/4 ballad that name checks Oscar Wilde, Edgar Allan Poe and Henry David Thoreau. According to Morrison, the song derived \"from what was running through my head\" and it marked a return to the stream of consciousness channeled song-writing that had not been evident since several of the songs contained in his 1972 album, \"Saint Dominic's Preview\".\n\n\"Linden Arden Stole the Highlights\" segues into \"Who Was That Masked Man\" (sung in falsetto) which has a similar melody. The story line pertains to a mythological Irish expatriate living in San Francisco who, when cornered, turns violent and then goes into hiding, \"living with a gun\", and references a childhood interest in The Lone Ranger. Morrison described the anti-hero Linden Arden as being \"about an image of an Irish American living in San Francisco - it's really a hard man type of thing, whilst the latter was a song about what it's like when you absolutely cannot trust anybody. Not as in some paranoia, but in reality.\"\n\n\"Streets of Arklow\" describes a perfect day in \"God's green land\" and is a tribute to the Wicklow town visited during this vacation trip. The opening lines of the song: \"And as we walked through the streets of Arklow, oh the colours of the day warm, and our heads were filled with poetry, in the morning coming onto dawn\" were said to \"contain the thematic seeds of the whole album: nature, poetry, god, innocence re-found and love lost\" by PopMatters critic John Kennedy.\n\n\"You Don't Pull No Punches, but You Don't Push the River\" is frequently regarded as one of Morrison's most accomplished compositions. He revealed that the song owed a considerable debt to his readings in Gestalt therapy. Johnny Rogan felt that this track was representative of \"an experimental peak, a step beyond even his most ambitious work.\"\n\nOn the second side of the album, the songs \"Bulbs\" and \"Cul de Sac\" focus on emigration to America and homecoming.\n\nThe album concludes with the love songs, \"Comfort You\", \"Come Here My Love\", and \"Country Fair\"—the latter two employing the traditional Irish ballad style. To Clinton Heylin, the songs also spoke to \"the healing power of love... here at last are songs that speak of what he can do for her, rather than concerned solely with his needs and wants.\" Heylin comments on the song, \"Come Here My Love\": \"This is no 'Autumn Song'. Rather, it sounds a lot like a man learning how to love again.\" Morrison spoke of \"Country Fair\" as having the same kind of feeling as \"And It Stoned Me\", although that song was used to open the \"Moondance\" album, instead of as a kind of closure.\nYears before \"Twilight Zone\" was released as a bonus track on the 2008 re-mastered version of \"Veedon Fleece\", Brian Hinton had said about the version of the song on \"The Philosopher's Stone\": \"'Twilight Zone' is a very slow, bluesy, late-night song that would fit right in on \"Veedon Fleece\".\"\n\nWhen \"Veedon Fleece\" was released, it sold poorly and was received unfavourably by critics from \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Melody Maker\". The latter wrote that the first side of the album features \"some of his least memorable shots at songwriting since \"Tupelo Honey\"\". Jim Miller from \"Rolling Stone\" found the entire album \"self-indulgent\" and called it \"mood music for mature hippies.\"\n\nIn a retrospective review for \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" (2004), Rob Sheffield hailed \"Veedon Fleece\" as \"the culmination of everything Van was doing up to that point, all Celtic mystic tumult in the vocals and pastoral beauty in the music\" and ranked it among \"his most majestic music\". Allmusic critics Jason Ankeny and Thom Jurek called the album \"brilliant\" and commented that \"With its elegiac tone and deeply autobiographical lyrics, this was a Morrison who didn't so readily associate himself with the feel-good, peace, love, and rhythm & blues sound American audiences were used to.\" John Kennedy from PopMatters felt it is beautiful in the sense defined by French poet Charles Baudelaire, \"a poet's album, a jazz lover's album, a masterpiece of soul-singing, a blue and green journey into the places of the heart that were first opened up for dowsing with \"Astral Weeks\".\" Derek Miller of \"Stylus Magazine\" believed it is astonishing, \"so frothy and thick, that requires silence when it's over ... To me that's the better explanation for Morrison's three-year absence. He'd just finished \"Veedon Fleece\".\" Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in \"\" (1981), and said it is Morrison's most shamelessly cathartic work since \"Astral Weeks\", \"soothing, evocative late-night music\", but suffers from his long-windedness and a second side highlighted only by \"Bulbs\".\n\nThis album was followed by a three-year hiatus for Morrison from recording, and except for an appearance with the Band in 1976 on \"The Last Waltz\" concert at Winterland, from performing live. Clinton Heylin noted that \"Veedon Fleece\" is by far the most underplayed album in Morrison's canon. By 2010, only seven of the ten songs from the album have ever been played by Morrison in concert. Of those seven, only \"You Don't Pull No Punches, but You Don't Push the River\" and \"Streets of Arklow\" have been played more than twenty times live. \"Fair Play\" was performed for the first time live in June 2009. After \"Veedon Fleece\", most of Morrison's albums would chart higher in the UK than in the United States, partly due to his move back to Europe several years afterward.\n\nThe 30 June 2008 reissued and remastered version of the album contains an alternative take of \"Cul de Sac\" and \"Twilight Zone\". \"Who Was That Masked Man\" from this album was listed as one of the standout tracks from the six album reissue.\n\nBiographer Brian Hinton has said that when he agreed to write \"Celtic Crossroads\", it was with the hope that he might \"turn a few people on to this album, above all others in Morrison's rich oeuvre.\"\n\nSinéad O'Connor reviewed the album on 28 November 2007 on The Dave Fanning Show and praised it as: \"the record I always come back to again and again...It is far superior to \"Astral Weeks\" and I love \"Astral Weeks\". This is the definitive Van album with the definitive Van song, \"Who Was That Masked Man\"...It's the most obvious album he's ever done about Ireland...\"Veedon Fleece\" is the only thing I listen to just before I go on stage.\" When asked in an interview in 2005 to name something she considered \"a mind-altering work of art\", she answered: \"Van Morrison's \"Veedon Fleece\".\"\n\nSinger-songwriter Elvis Costello has referred to this album as one of his favourites and names \"Linden Arden Stole the Highlights\" as the song that makes this album \"special to (him).\"\n\nJosh Klinghoffer (Red Hot Chili Peppers and Dot Hacker) hails the record in Q Magazine in November 2011. When asked which record he could not be without, he answered: \"At this point I’ve determined that \"Veedon Fleece\" by Van Morrison is my favourite record of all time. I love it from start to finish; it’s perfect\".\n\nThe album cover photograph shows Morrison sitting in the grass between two Irish wolfhounds. The photographer, Tom Collins, took the original photograph that situated Morrison and the dogs adjacent to the Sutton Castle Hotel, a converted mansion overlooking Dublin Bay, where Morrison first stayed upon arriving in Ireland for his vacation.\n\nSeveral authors have commented on the mysterious object, \"Veedon Fleece\" as it appears in the album title and in the lyrics of the song \"You Don't Pull No Punches, but You Don't Push the River\". Scott Thomas states in his review: \"The Morrison-conceived Veedon Fleece is the symbol of everything yearned for in the preceding songs; spiritual enlightenment, wisdom, community, artistic vision and love.\" Steve Turner concludes: \"The Veedon Fleece...appears to be Van's Irish equivalent of the Holy Grail a religious relic that would answer his questions if he could track it down on his quest around the west coast of Ireland.\" Morrison explained the title with: \"I haven't a clue about what the title means. It's actually a person's name. I have a whole set of characters in my head that I'm trying to fit into things. \"Veedon Fleece\" is one of them and I just suddenly started singing it in one of these songs, It's like a stream of consciousness thing.\" Morrison once told a fan when questioned about the meaning, \"It doesn't mean anything, I made it up myself.\"\n\nThe songs are so personal and idiosyncratic in nature that they have not been covered by well-known musicians except for versions of \"Fair Play\" and \"Linden Arden Stole the Highlights\" by Robyn Hitchcock. Hitchcock's first performances of the two songs were in May 1991 at McCabe's Guitar Shop. Scout Niblett recorded a version of \"Comfort You\" with Will Oldham on her album \"This Fool Can Die Now\". A version of \"Come Here My Love\" was recorded by dream pop collective This Mortal Coil on their 1986 album \"Filigree & Shadow\".\n\nAll songs written by Van Morrison\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBillboard (North America)\nUK Album Chart (United Kingdom)\n"}

He was also a professional football player, actor and author.\n\nErnest Barnes Jr. was born during the Jim Crow in \"the bottom\" community of Durham, North Carolina, near the Hayti District of the city. He had a younger brother, James (b. 1942), as well as a half-brother, Benjamin B. Rogers Jr. (1920–1970). Ernest Jr. was nicknamed \"June\". His father, Ernest E. Barnes Sr. (\n–1966), worked as a shipping clerk for Liggett Myers Tobacco Company. His mother, Fannie Mae Geer (1905–2004), oversaw the household staff for a prominent Durham attorney and local Board of Education member, Frank L. Fuller Jr.\n\nOn days when Fannie allowed \"June\" (Barnes' nickname to family and childhood friends) to accompany her to work, Mr. Fuller encouraged him to peruse the art books and listen to classical music. The young Ernest was intrigued and captivated by the works of master artists. By the time Barnes entered the first grade, he was familiar with the works of such masters as Toulouse-Lautrec, Delacroix, Rubens and Michelangelo. When he entered junior high school, he could appreciate, as well as decode, many of the cherished masterpieces within the walls of mainstream museums – although it would be many more years before he was allowed entrance because of segregation.\n\nA self-described chubby and unathletic child, Barnes was taunted and bullied by classmates. He continually sought refuge in his sketchbooks, finding the less-traveled parts of campus away from other students. One day Ernest was drawing in his notebook in a quiet area of the school. He was discovered hiding there by the masonry teacher, Tommy Tucker, who was also the weightlifting coach and a former athlete. He was intrigued with Barnes' drawings, so he asked the aspiring artist about his grades and goals. Tucker shared his own experience of how bodybuilding improved his strength and outlook on life. That one encounter would begin Barnes' discipline and dedication that would permeate his life. In his senior year at Hillside High School, Barnes became the captain of the football team and state champion in the shot put.\n\nBarnes attended racially segregated schools. In 1956 he graduated from Hillside High School with 26 athletic scholarship offers. Segregation prevented him from attending nearby Duke University or the University of North Carolina. His mother promised him a car if he lived at home so he attended the all-Black North Carolina College at Durham (formerly North Carolina College for Negroes, now North Carolina Central University). At North Carolina College he majored in art on a full athletic scholarship. His track coach was Dr. Leroy T. Walker. Barnes played the football positions of tackle and center at NCC.\n\nAt age 18, on a college art class field trip to the newly desegregated North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh, Barnes inquired where he could find \"paintings by Negro artists\". The docent responded, \"Your people don't express themselves that way\". 23 years later, in 1979, when Barnes returned to the museum for a solo exhibition, North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt attended.\n\nIn 1990 Barnes was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts by North Carolina Central University.\n\nIn 1999 Barnes was bestowed \"The University Award\", the highest honor by the University of North Carolina Board of Governors.\n\nIn December 1959 Barnes was drafted in the 10th round by the then-World Champion Baltimore Colts. He was originally selected in the 8th-round by the Washington Redskins, who renounced the pick minutes after discovering he was a Negro.\n\nShortly after his 22nd birthday, while at the Colts training camp, Barnes was interviewed by N.P. Clark, sportswriter for the Baltimore News-Post newspaper. Until then Barnes was always known by his birth name, Ernest Barnes. But when Clark's article appeared on July 20, 1960, it referred to him as \"Ernie Barnes,\" which changed his name and life forever.\n\nBarnes was the last cut of the Colts' training camp. After Baltimore released Barnes, the newly formed Titans of New York immediately signed him because the team had first option on any player released within the league.\n\nBarnes loathed being on the Titans. He said, \"(New York team organization) was a circus of ineptitude. The equipment was poor, the coaches not as knowledgeable as the ones in Baltimore. We were like a group of guys in the neighborhood who said let's pretend we're pros.\"\n\nAfter their seventh game on October 9, 1960 at Jeppesen Stadium, his teammate Howard Glenn died. Barnes asked for his release two days later. The cause of Glenn's death was reported as a broken neck. However, Barnes and other teammates have long attributed it to heatstroke. In a later interview, Barnes said, \"They never really said what he died of. (Coach) Sammy Baugh said he'd broken his neck in a game the Sunday before. But how could that be? How could he have hit in practice all week with a broken neck? What he died of, I think, was more like heat exhaustion. I told them I didn't want to play on a team like this.\"\n\nBarnes decided to accept a previous offer from Coach Al Davis at the Los Angeles Chargers. Barnes joined their team at mid-season as a member of their taxi squad. The following season in 1961 the team moved to San Diego. It was there Barnes met teammate Jack Kemp, and the two men would share a very close lifelong friendship. \nDuring the off-seasons with the Chargers, Barnes was program director at San Diego's Southeast YMCA working with parolees from the California Youth Authority. He also worked as the Sports Editor for \"The Voice\", a local San Diego newspaper, writing a weekly column called \"A Matter of Sports.\"\n\nBarnes also illustrated several articles for \"San Diego Magazine\" during the off-seasons in 1962 and 1963.\n\nBarnes' first television interview as a professional football player and artist was in 1962 on \"The Regis Philbin Show\" on KGTV in San Diego. It was Philbin's first talk show. They would see each other again 45 years later when Philbin attended the tribute to Barnes in New York City.\n\nMidway through Barnes' second season with the Chargers, he was cut after a series of injuries. He was then signed to the Denver Broncos.\n\nBarnes was often fined by Denver Coach Jack Faulkner when caught sketching during team meetings. One of the sketches that he was fined $100 for sold years later for $1000.\nMany times during breaks, Barnes would run off the field onto the sideline to give his offensive line coach Red Miller the scraps of paper of his sketches and notes.\n\n\"During a timeout you've got nothing to do – you're not talking – you're just trying to breathe, mostly. Nothing to take out that little pencil and write down what you saw. The shape of the linemen. The body language a defensive lineman would occupy... his posture... What I see when you pull. The reaction of the defense to your movement. The awareness of the lines within the movement, the pattern within the lines, the rhythm of movement. A couple of notes to me would denote an action... an image that I could instantly recreate in my mind. Some of those notes have been made into paintings. Quite a few, really.\"\n\nOn Barnes' 1964 Denver Broncos Topps football card he is shown wearing jersey #55 although he never played in that number. His jersey was #62.\n\nBarnes was called \"Big Rembrandt\" by his Denver teammates. Coincidentally, Barnes and Rembrandt share the same birthday.\n\nIn 1965, after his second season with the Broncos, Barnes signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders in Canada. In the final quarter of their last exhibition game, Barnes fractured his right foot, effectively ending his professional football career.\n\nShortly after his final football game, Barnes went to the 1965 NFL owners meeting in Houston in hopes of becoming the league's official artist. There he was introduced to New York Jets owner Sonny Werblin, who was intrigued by Barnes and his art. He paid for Barnes to bring his paintings to New York City. Later they met at a gallery and unbeknownst to Barnes, three art critics were there to evaluate his paintings. They told Werblin that Barnes was \"the most expressive painter of sports since George Bellows.\"\n\nIn what was one of the most unusual posts in the history of the NFL, Werblin retained Barnes as a salaried player, but positioned him in front of the canvas, rather than on the football field. Werblin told Barnes, \"You have more value to the country as an artist than as a football player.\"\n\nBarnes' November 1966 debut solo exhibition, hosted by Werblin at the Grand Central Art Galleries in New York City was critically acclaimed and all the paintings sold.\n\nIn 1971 Barnes wrote a series of essays (illustrated with his own drawings) in the Gridiron newspaper titled \"I Hate the Game I Love\" (with Neil Amdur). These articles became the beginning manuscript of his autobiography, later-published in 1995 titled \"From Pads to Palette\" which chronicles his transition from professional football to his art career.\n\nIn 1993 Barnes was selected to the \"Black College Football 100th Year All-Time Team\" by the Sheridan Broadcasting Network.\n\nBarnes credits his college art instructor Ed Wilson for laying the foundation for his development as an artist. Wilson was a sculptor who instructed Barnes to paint from his own life experiences. \"He made me conscious of the fact that the artist who is useful to America is one who studies his own life and records it through the medium of art, manners and customs of his own experiences.\"\n\nAll his life, Barnes was ambivalent about his football experience. In interviews and in personal appearances, Barnes said he hated the violence and the physical torment of the sport. However, his years as an athlete gave him unique, in-depth observations. \"(Wilson) told me to pay attention to what my body felt like in movement. Within that elongation, there's a feeling. And attitude and expression. I hate to think had I not played sports what my work would look like.\"\n\nBarnes sold his first painting \"Slow Dance\" at age 21 in 1959 for $90 to Boston Celtic Sam Jones. It was subsequently lost in a fire at Jones' home.\n\nNumerous artists have been influenced by Barnes' art and unique style. Accordingly, several copyright infringement lawsuits have been settled and are currently pending.\n\nErnie Barnes framed his paintings with distressed wood in homage to his father. In his 1995 autobiography, Barnes wrote of his father: “... with so little education, he had worked so hard for us. His legacy to me was his effort, and that was plenty. He knew absolutely nothing about art.”\n\nWeeks before Ernie Barnes’ first solo art exhibition in 1966, he was at the family home in Durham as his father lay in the hospital after suffering a stroke. He noticed the usually well-maintained white picketed fence had gone untended since his father’s illness. Days later, Ernest E. Barnes Sr. died. “I placed a painting against the fence and stood away and had a look. I was startled at the marriage between the old wood fence and the painting. It was perfect. In tribute, Daddy’s fence would hug all my paintings in a prestigious New York gallery. That would have made him smile.”\n\nA consistent and distinct feature in Barnes' work is the closed eyes of his subjects. \"It was in 1971 when I conceived the idea of \"The Beauty of the Ghetto\" as an exhibition. And I showed it to some people who were Black to get a reaction. And from one (person) it was very negative. And when I began to express my points of view (to this) professional man, he resisted the notion. And as a result of his comments and his attitude I began to see, observe, how blind we are to one another's humanity. Blinded by a lot of things that have, perhaps, initiated feelings in that light. We don't see into the depths of our interconnection. The gifts, the strength and potential within other human beings. We stop at color quite often. So one of the things we have to be aware of is who we are in order to have the capacity to like others. But when you cannot visualize the offerings of another human being you're obviously not looking at the human being with open eyes.\" \"We look upon each other and decide immediately: This person is black, so he must be... This person lives in poverty, so he must be...\"\n\nMoving to an all-Jewish neighborhood in Los Angeles known as the Fairfax District in 1971 was a major turning point in Barnes' life and art.\n\"Fairfax enlivened me to everyday life themes,\" he said, \"and forced me to look at my life – the way I had grown up, the customs within my community versus the customs in the Jewish community. Their customs were documented, ours were not. Because we were so clueless that our own culture had value and because of the phrase 'Black is Beautiful' had just come into fashion, Black people were just starting to appreciate themselves as a people. But when it was said, 'I'm Black and I'm Proud,' I said, 'proud of what?' And that question of 'proud of what' led to a series of paintings that became “The Beauty of the Ghetto.'\"\n\nIn response to the 1960s \"Black is beautiful\" cultural movement and James Brown's 1968 \"Say it Loud: I'm Black and I'm Proud\" song, Barnes created \"The Beauty of the Ghetto\" exhibition of 35 paintings that toured major American cities from 1972 to 1979 hosted by dignitaries, professional athletes and celebrities.\n\nOf this exhibition, Barnes said, \"I am providing a pictorial background for an understanding into the aesthetics of black America. It is not a plea to people to continue to live there (in the ghetto) but for those who feel trapped, it is...a challenge of how beautiful life can be.\"\n\nWhen the exhibition was on view in 1974 at the Museum of African Art in Washington, DC, Rep. John Conyers stressed the important positive message of the exhibit in the Congressional Record.\n\nThe Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee named Barnes \"Sports Artist of the 1984 Olympic Games\". LAOOC President Peter V. Ueberroth said Barnes and his art \"captured the essence of the Olympics\" and \"portray the city's ethnic diversity, the power and emotion of sports competition, the singleness of purpose and hopes that go into the making of athletes the world over.\" Barnes was commissioned to create five Olympic-themed paintings and serve as an official Olympic spokesman to encourage inner city youth.\n\n1985: Barnes was named the first \"Sports Artist of the Year\" by the United States Sports Academy.\n\n1987: Barnes created \"Fastbreak\", a commissioned painting of the World Champion Los Angeles Lakers basketball team that included Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Kurt Rambis and Michael Cooper.\n\n1996: Carolina Panthers football team owners Rosalind and Jerry Richardson (Barnes' former Colts teammate) commissioned Barnes to create the large painting \"Victory in Overtime\" (approximately 7 ft. x 14 ft.). It was unveiled before the team's 1996 inaugural season and hangs permanently in the owner's suite at the stadium. Richardson and Barnes were Baltimore Colts teammates briefly in 1960.\n\n1996: To commemorate their 50th anniversary in 1996, the National Basketball Association commissioned Barnes to create a painting with the theme, \"Where we were, where we are, and where we are going.\" The painting, \"The Dream Unfolds\" hangs in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. A limited edition of lithographs were made, with the first 50 prints going to each of the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team. \n2004: Barnes was named \"America's Best Painter of Sports\" by the American Sport Art Museum & Archives.\n\nOther notable sports commissions include paintings for the New Orleans Saints, Oakland Raiders and Boston Patriots football team owners.\n\nShortly after Barnes was drafted by the Baltimore Colts, Barnes was invited to see their Colts' NFL Championship Game vs. the New York Giants at Memorial Stadium in Maryland on December 27, 1959. The Colts won 31–16 and Barnes was filled with layers of emotion after watching the game from the Colts' bench. At age 21, he had just signed his football contract and met his new teammates Johnny Unitas, Jim Parker, Lenny Moore, Art Donovan, Gino Marchetti, Alan Ameche and \"Big Daddy\" Lipscomb.\n\nAfter he returned home, without making any preliminary sketches, he went directly to a blank canvas to record his point of view. Using a palette knife, \"painting in quick, direct movements hoping to capture the vision...before it evaporated,\" Barnes said, he created \"The Bench\" in less than an hour. Throughout his life, \"The Bench\" remained in Barnes' possession, even taking it with him to all his football training camps and hiding it under his bed. It would be the only painting Barnes would never sell, despite many substantial offers, including a $25,000 bid at his first show in 1966.\n\nIn 2014, Barnes' wife Bernie presented \"The Bench\" painting to the Pro Football Hall of Fame for their permanent collection in Canton, Ohio.\n\nBarnes created the painting \"The Sugar Shack\" in 1971. It gained international exposure when it was used on the \"Good Times\" television series and on the 1976 Marvin Gaye album \"I Want You\". \nAccording to Barnes, he created the original version of \"The Sugar Shack\" after reflecting upon his childhood, during which he was not \"able to go to a dance.\" In a 2008 interview, Barnes said, \"\"The Sugar Shack\" is a recall of a childhood experience. It was the first time my innocence met with the sins of dance. The painting transmits rhythm so the experience is re-created in the person viewing it. To show that African-Americans utilize rhythm as a way of resolving physical tension.\"\n\n\"The Sugar Shack\" has been known to art critics for embodying the style of art composition known as \"Black Romantic,\" which, according to Natalie Hopkinson of \"The Washington Post\", is the \"visual-art equivalent of the Chitlin' circuit.\"\n\nWhen Barnes first created \"The Sugar Shack\", he included his hometown radio station WSRC on a banner. (He incorrectly listed the frequency as 620, though it was actually 1410. Barnes confused what he used to hear WSRC's on-air personality Norfley Whitted saying \"620 on your dial\" when Whitted was at his former station WDNC in the early 1950s.)\n\nAfter Marvin Gaye asked him for permission to use the painting as an album cover, Barnes then augmented the painting by adding references that allude to Gaye's album, including banners hanging from the ceiling to promote the album's singles.\n\nDuring the \"\" anniversary television special on March 25, 1983, tribute was paid to \"The Sugar Shack\" with a dance interpretation of the painting. It was also during this telecast that Michael Jackson introduced his famous \"moonwalk\" dance.\n\nThe original piece is currently owned by Jim and Jeannine Epstein, and is on display at the North Carolina Museum of History in Raleigh. A duplicate created by Barnes was created in 1976 on display at the California African American Museum (CAAM).\n\nBarnes' work appears on the following album covers: \n\n1992: In the wake of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Mayor Tom Bradley used Barnes' painting \"Growth Through Limits\" as an inspirational billboard in the inner-city. Barnes contributed $1,000 to the winner of a slogan contest among the city's junior high school students that best represented the painting.\n\n1995: Barnes' work was included in the traveling group exhibition \"20th Century Masterworks of African-American Artists II\".\n1998: Barnes' painting \"The Advocate\" was donated to the North Carolina Central University School of Law by a private collector. Barnes felt compelled to create the painting from his \"concern with the just application of the law... the integrity of the legal process for all people, but especially those without resource or influence.\"\n2001: While watching the tragic events of 9/11, Barnes created the painting \"In Remembrance\". It was formally unveiled at the Seattle Art Museum. It was later acquired on behalf of the City of Philadelphia and donated to its African American Museum. A limited number of giclée prints were sold with 100% of the proceeds going to the Hero Scholarship Fund, which provides college tuition and expenses to children of Pennsylvania police and fire personnel killed in the line of duty.\n\n2005: Three of Barnes' original paintings were exhibited at London's Whitechapel Gallery in the 2005 \"Back to Black: Art, Cinema & Racial Imaginary\" art exhibition.\n\n2005: Kanye West commissioned Barnes to create a painting to depict his life-changing experience following his near-fatal car crash. \"A Life Restored\" measures 9 ft. x 10 ft. In the center of the painting is a large angel reaching out to a much smaller figure of West.\n\nOctober 2007: Barnes' final public exhibition. The National Football League and Time Warner sponsored \"A Tribute to Artist and NFL Alumni Ernie Barnes\" in New York City.\n\nAt the time of his passing, Barnes had been working on an exhibition \"Liberating Humanity From Within\" which featured a majority of paintings he created in the last few years of his life. Plans are under way for the exhibition to travel throughout the country and abroad.\n\nBarnes appeared on a 1967 episode of the game show \"To Tell the Truth\". The panelists correctly guessed Barnes was the professional football player-turned-artist.\n\nBarnes played Deke Coleman in the 1969 motion picture \"Number One\", which stars Charlton Heston and Jessica Walter. Barnes played Dr. Penfield in the 1971 movie \"Doctors' Wives\", which starred Dyan Cannon, Richard Crenna, Gene Hackman and Carroll O'Connor.\n\nIn 1971 Barnes, along with Mike Henry, created the \"Super Comedy Bowl\", a variety show CBS television special which showcased pro athletes with celebrities such as John Wayne, Frank Gifford, Alex Karras, Joe Namath, Jack Lemmon, Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett and Tony Curtis. A second special aired in 1972.\n\nThroughout the \"Good Times\" television series (1974–79) most of the paintings by the character J.J. are works by Ernie Barnes. However a few images, including \"Black Jesus\" in the first season (1974), were not painted by Barnes. \"The Sugar Shack\" made its debut on the show's fourth season (1976–77) during the opening and closing credits. In the fifth season (1977–78) \"The Sugar Shack\" was only used in the closing credits for five early episodes during that season. In the sixth season (1978–79), \"The Sugar Shack\" was only used in opening credits for the first eight episodes and in the closing credits for five early episodes during that season. In the fifth and sixth seasons (1977–79), \"The Sugar Shack\" appears in the background of the Evans family apartment. Barnes had a bit part on two episodes of \"Good Times\": The Houseguest (February 18, 1975) and Sweet Daddy Williams (January 20, 1976).\n\nBarnes' artwork was also used on many television series, including \"Columbo\", \"The White Shadow\", \"Dream On\", \"The Hughleys\", \"The Wayans Bros.\", \"Wife Swap\", and \"Soul Food\", and in the movies \"Drumline\" and \"Boyz n the Hood\".\n\nIn 1981 Barnes played baseball catcher Josh Gibson of the Negro League in the television movie \"Don't Look Back: The Story of Leroy ‘Satchel' Paige\" with Lou Gossett Jr. playing Paige.\n\nThe 2016 film \"Southside with You\" (about Barack and Michelle Obama's first date) prominently features Barnes' work in an early scene where the two characters visit an art exhibition.\n\nBarnes passed away on Monday evening, April 27, 2009 at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, California from myeloid leukemia. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in two places: at his hometown Durham, North Carolina, near the site of where his family home once stood, and at the beach in Carmel, California, one of his favorite cities.\n"}

It was established to bridge the gap for 18 to 25 year olds between membership of youth organisations—such as the Boys' Brigade and Boy Scouts—and the period of responsible adulthood. Another impetus for its creation was the failure of the British government to extend the legislation for the Territorial Force—introduced in 1908—to Ireland. It was hoped that the War Office would absorb the YCV into the Territorial Force, however such offers were dismissed. Not until the outbreak of World War I did the YCV—by then a battalion of the UVF—become part of the British Army as the 14th Battalion of the Royal Irish Rifles.\n\nThe YCV was launched in Belfast City Hall on 10 September 1912 at a meeting chaired by the Lord Mayor, Robert James McMordie, who became its first president. The ideals of the YCV at its onset was stated as being \"non-sectarian\" and \"non-political\", and despite its leadership and membership being largely drawn from unionist families it included prominent Belfast nationalist Francis Joseph Biggar as part of its committee. The creation of the YCV had nothing to do with the Home Rule Crisis or Ulster Day on 28 September 1912, which saw the signing of the anti-Home Rule Ulster Covenant. However, by May 1914 the YCV—despite some controversy—merged with the anti-Home Rule Ulster Volunteer Force.\n\nDespite its name implying that it covered the whole of Ireland it never extended outside of Belfast, however there were plans to set up battalions in places such as counties Londonderry and Fermanagh.\n\nThe YCV's name would later be resurrected by the YCV youth movement attached to the 1966 Ulster Volunteer Force (also UVF). Although there is no direct continuity between the two groups, they share the same emblem of a shamrock surmounted by a Red Hand of Ulster.\n\nThe YCV had its origins in the Belfast Citizens Association, a conservative ratepayers group. The YCV had its first meeting just prior to the signing of the Solemn League and Covenant (Ulster), opposing Home Rule, in Belfast City Hall on 10 September 1912. The group was inaugurated by Robert James McMordie in his role as Lord Mayor of Belfast and was led by Frederick Crawford. Other leading figures in the group's foundation included Councillor Frank Workman and foundry owner James Mackie. The group initially struggled to attract a Commanding Officer before eventually appointing Colonel R Spencer Chichester, a strongly right-wing Unionist who favoured purchasing guns for the YCV. Although officially called the YCV of Ireland it had no members beyond Belfast.\n\nEach member was to pay 2s.6d (12.5 p) on joining the YCV and a further 6d (2.5p) each month as well as instalments on a £1.10s fee for purchase of their grey uniform. he was to attend weekly drills to learn \"modified military and police drill, single stick, rifle and baton exercises, signalling, knot-tying and other such exercises\". If possible, he was also to gain some knowledge of \"life-saving and ambulance work\". \n\nThe constitution of the YCV insisted that members should not take part in any political meeting or demonstration, or wear their YCV uniforms at such events. They were stated as being \"non-sectarian and non-political\" and their objectives were considered to be:\n\nMembership was open to anyone aged between eighteen and thirty-five who was over five feet in height and could present \"credentials of good character\". Some Roman Catholics did join the YCV, though it was overwhelmingly Protestant in numbers. Made up mainly of middle class members, the YCV was patterned after the Scout movement, albeit for young men who were too old for that group, as well as the Boys' Brigade and Church Lads' and Church Girls' Brigade. The group was formed in part because the Territorial Force had not been extended to Ireland and members wanted a substitute.\n\nThe foundation of the YCV was hailed by the \"Northern Whig\", a Unionist daily paper, although the \"Irish News\", a nationalist paper, was less enthusiastic, speculating that the YCV had been set up as an organised strike-breaking force, with memories of the 1907 Belfast Dock strike still fresh.\n\nThe anti-Home Rule Ulster Volunteer Force was created in January 1913 and there is evidence of co-operation between them and the YCV including the Larne gun-running. As the Home Rule crisis escalated, pressure grew for the YCV to become part of the UVF, and such a proposal was made in March 1914. This caused a degree of controversy and division amongst its membership, even with those who were members of both organisations who sought for the YCV to remain non-political. The 1st Battalion YCV went ahead and merged with the UVF, leading to a resolution being proposed and seconded at a YCV council meeting declaring regret that they were not consulted beforehand and that the 1st Battalion had no authority to proceed. Some members of the YCV resigned because of the merger, however the majority didn't and on 17 May 1914 it ceased to be an independent organisation becoming a battalion of the UVF. At the time of the merger the YCV had around 400 Catholic members who drifted from the movement rather than switch to the Protestant UVF.\n\nFrom soon after its inception the YCV faced financial problems as it tried and failed to solicit donations from major local businesses. By early 1914 the situation had become so dire that Frank Workman, a wealthy industrialist who was a partner in Workman and Clark ship builders, was paying for the upkeep of the group out of his own pocket. Despite Chichester's attempts to fully militarise the group, the British government refused to offer financial assistance to the YCV, in return for placing themselves at the government's disposal. \n\nThe Ulster Volunteers were most closely associated with the 36th (Ulster) Division during the First World War and the YCV as a unit formed the 14th Battalion of the Royal Irish Rifles, which was part of the 36th. The Battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Chichester, who addressed the soldiers as \"young citizens\", and wore the grey uniform of the YCV, although the group's 750 members were augmented by troops from mainland Britain (who made up 25% of the 14th) and the rest of Ireland (17%). A large group of English conscripts in the Battalion were nicknamed the \"Gawd Blimey Brigade\" by the original Belfast members, many of whom came from middle and upper-class families and looked down on the more rough and ready English soldiers. The more well off origins of the YCV members saw the Battalion itself acquire the nickname \"Young Chocolate Soldiers\".\n\nThe group mutinied twice in 1915, first in June when soldiers drilling at Shane's Castle near Randalstown refused to march back to barracks, insisting that a train be sent to carry them instead. Chichester acceded to this demand. This was followed in September when the group mutinied over the cancellation of leave as part of a wider mutiny within the 36th. The mutiny in the 14th was defused however by a \"Major B\" who convinced the soldiers to abandon their plans. Soon after this they were attached to the 12th Brigade following a reorganisation of the Ulster forces.\n\nBy 1917, the 14th was generally seen as one of the poorer combat units of the Ulster Division. A letter by Major General Oliver Nugent to the Adjutant General in December 1917 described them as \"totally wanting in any military spirit\" and stated that \"the Brigadier says he cannot trust them and I know that he is right [as] they are poor stuff either as workers or fighters and have been a constant source of anxiety during the past three weeks\". The group was disbanded in early 1918 as part of a wider reduction in size for the 36th (Ulster) Division.\n\nPlans were made in 1919 to revive the YCV under the patronage of James Johnston, the serving Mayor of Belfast. Edward Carson however had little enthusiasm and suggested they contact the British authorities at Dublin Castle for their opinion. When this line of contact was ignored the plan was abandoned and the YCV did not return. The name was revived in 1972 for a separate group with no direct connection to the original.\n\n"}

Forney\n\nMatthias Nace Forney (March 28, 1835 – January 14, 1908) was an American steam locomotive designer and builder. He is most well known for the design of the Forney type locomotive. Locomotives that he designed served the elevated railroads of New York City for many years before that system converted to electric power. One example of a Forney 0-4-4T locomotive built in 1902 by Baldwin Locomotive Works has been restored for daily operations on the Disneyland Railroad in Anaheim, California, as the railroad's number 5, \"Ward Kimball\".\nForney was born March 28, 1835 in Hanover, Pennsylvania. He apprenticed with another prominent locomotive builder, Ross Winans, before joining the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) as a draftsman in 1855. He left the B&O in 1858, then worked for the Illinois Central Railroad from about 1861 to 1864. In that position, he patented an 0-4-4T locomotive that was the first of the \"Forney\" types of locomotives, characterized by the truck (US) or bogie (UK) under the coal bunker/water tank. In 1865 Forney changed employers again, this time to the Hinkley Locomotive Works, where he stayed until 1870. At that time, he started working as an associate editor for \"Railroad Gazette\" and quickly earned a reputation as an expert in steam locomotive theory. In late 1886, he bought the rival publication \"American Railroad Journal\", as well as \"Van Nostrand's Engineering Magazine\". He merged the two titles as \"The Railroad and Engineering Journal\", describing himself as \"Editor and Proprietor\". He renamed the publication \"American Engineer and Railroad Journal\" in 1893.\n\nForney was a founding member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and he participated heavily in other engineering organizations such as the Master Car Builders Association.\n\nHe died on January 14, 1908 in New York, New York.\n\nForney was the author of the book \"Catechism of the Locomotive\", first published in 1873. This work is recognized as the seminal authority on steam locomotive construction in the late 19th century. \n\nHe was an editor for \"The Railroad Gazette,\" an influential weekly newspaper, for many years, including 1880 (with S. Wright Dunning).\n\nThe Forney Transportation Museum in Denver, Colorado, has a Forney Locomotive 040-T on display. The museum was founded by Matthais Forney's second cousin J.D.

{"id": "2136842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2136842", "title": "Sardine run", "text": "Sardine run\n\nThe sardine run of southern Africa occurs from May through July when billions of sardines – or more specifically the Southern African pilchard \"Sardinops sagax\" – spawn in the cool waters of the Agulhas Bank and move northward along the east coast of South Africa. Their sheer numbers create a feeding frenzy along the coastline.\nThe run, containing millions of individual sardines, occurs when a current of cold water heads north from the Agulhas Bank up to Mozambique where it then leaves the coastline and goes further east into the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn terms of biomass, researchers estimate the sardine run could rival East Africa's great wildebeest migration. However, little is known of the phenomenon. It is believed that the water temperature has to drop below 21 °C in order for the migration to take place. In 2003, the sardines failed to 'run' for the third time in 23 years. While 2005 saw a good run, 2006 marked another non-run.\n\nThe shoals are often more than 7 km long, 1.5 km wide and 30 metres deep and are clearly visible from spotter planes or from the surface.\n\nSardines group together when they are threatened. This instinctual behaviour is a defence mechanism, as lone individuals are more likely to be eaten than large groups.\n\nThe sardine run is still poorly understood from an ecological point of view.\nThere have been various hypotheses, sometimes contradictory, that try to explain why and how the run occurs.\n\nA recent interpretation of the causes is that the sardine run is most likely a seasonal reproductive migration of a genetically distinct subpopulation of sardine that moves along the coast from the eastern Agulhas Bank to the coast of KwaZulu-Natal in most years if not in every year.\n\nThe migration is restricted to the inshore waters by the preference of sardine for cooler water and the strong and warm offshore Agulhas Current, which flows in the opposite direction to the migration, and is strongest just off the continental shelf.\nA band of cooler coastal water and the occurrence of Natal Pulses and break-away eddies make it possible for sardine shoals to overcome their habitat constraints. The importance of these enabling factors is greatest where the continental shelf is narrowest.\n\nThe presence of eggs off the KwaZulu-Natal coast suggests that sardine stay there for several months and their return migration during late winter to spring is nearly always unnoticeable because it probably occurs at depths where the water is cooler than at the surface.\n\nIn some years there does not appear to be a sardine run. This may be because it is not detected by coastal observers either because it actually does not occur due to high water temperatures and/or other hydrographic barriers, or the migration may occur farther offshore and possibly deeper due to unusual conditions.\n\nSardine prefer water temperatures between 14 and 20 °C. Each southern winter the nearshore sea temperature along the South African south east coast drops to within this range. Along the KwaZulu-Natal coast, sardine may be found in water warmer than 20 °C.\nIt was hypothesized that factors beside temperature may influence the movement of sardine along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline, One of these factors may be predation pressure.\n\nThe KwaZulu-Natal coast includes varied oceanographic regions, each influenced by distinct environmental forces.\n\nThese distinct regions may affect sardine distribution and movement.\n\nSome oceanographic variables have been found useful for describing conditions influencing sardine presence.\n\nOther conditions associated with sardine presence are:\n\nFavourable:\nUnfavourable:\nNorth-easterly and north-westerly winds and north to south currents have a cooling effect upon nearshore sea surface temperatures, but south-easterly winds and increasing air temperatures cause nearshore sea surface temperature warming.\n\nDolphins (estimated as being up to 18,000 in number, mostly the common dolphin (\"Delphinus capensis\")) are largely responsible for rounding up the sardines into bait balls. These bait balls can be 10–20 metres in diameter and extend to a depth of 10 metres. The bait balls are short lived and seldom last longer than 10 minutes. Once the sardines are rounded up, sharks (primarily the bronze whaler), and birds (like the Cape gannet), and Bryde's whales take advantage of the opportunity. Other whale species, regardless of whether they do or not join the run, may appear in the vicinity such as humpback, southern right, and minke whales.\n\nThe Cape gannet is the predator species most closely associated with sardine presence along the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal coastline and is the most useful indicator of sardine run activity.\n\nSharks and large gamefish presence is also strongly associated with sardine presence during the run, but as they are not as easily observed from the surface they are not as useful a predictor of sardine presence.\n\nThe presence of common dolphins inshore along the east coast during winter is significantly associated with sardine presence, and the common dolphin can be considered the third most useful species for predicting sardine presence.\n\nThe resident population of bottlenose dolphin does not appear to associate with the sardine run, whereas the migrant stock does. This may explain why the bottlenose dolphin is less likely to predict sardine presence.\n\n2005 records:\nIn June and July 2005 the avian and mammal predators included Bryde’s whale (\"Balaenoptera edeni\"), African penguin (\"Spheniscus demersus\"), Cape cormorant (\"Phalacrocorax capensis\"), which were predominantly found in the cooler southern part of the region.\nPeak sardine run activity occurred within 4 km of shore at the northward limit of a strip of cool water (<21 °C) stretching along the East Coast. The principal predators at this stage were common dolphins (\"Delphinus capensis\") and Cape gannets (\"Morus capensis\").\n\nThe recent interest in the sardine run has had significant impact on the local economy. International and domestic divers join local tour operators on sardine run diving expeditions. Such expeditions run from Eastern Cape towns, including East London, Port Saint Johns, and Port Elizabeth. The run has become important to tourism and is considered to be one of the main attractions in KwaZulu-Natal during the winter holiday period. Both local and international tourists are attracted to the spectacle and are provided with opportunities to participate in activities such as dive charters and boat based predator viewing tours.\nThe KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board and East Coast Radio, facilitate a ‘Sardine Run Hotline’, which provides information on the position and movement of sardine shoals. Information is also provided on the internet.\n\nThe Sardine Run Association (www.thesardinerunassociation.org) has been formed to provide a link between tour operator s, tourists, non-governmental organisations,\nscientists, and local and national governments.\n\nThe sardine run also supports a small-scale, seasonal beach seine fishery.\n\nThe oldest known record of the run is a mention in the Natal Mercury newspaper of 4 August 1853.\nMore recently, the run has been the subject of natural history documentaries (e.g., the BBC’s Nature's Great Events) and printed popular media\n(e.g., National Geographic).\n\nPilot shoals were netted at Hibberdene on 20 June 2011, while the main shoal was sighted near Port St. Johns. Small pockets of sardines were seen between Mfazazana and Margate. About 25 crates of sardines were hauled out from the first netting at Hibberdene. A further 33 crates of sardines were netted and were sold at R700 per crate or R30 per dozen sardines. The 58 crates were sold \"within minutes\". An attempt was also made to net sardines at Banana Beach. About 500 common dolphins and numerous sharks were noted near Margate. Shark nets had been removed between Umgababa and Port Edward.\n\nSardines were netted at Park Rynie on 21 June 2011. Some large nets of 200–300 baskets of sardines were taken. The baskets sold at R600 each. A large gathering of sardine predators was seen off Port Grosvenor on the Wild Coast. Thousands of Cape gannets and dolphins were seen in a continuous line of about 6 km between Brazen Head and just north of the Umtata River. It is suspected that this year's shoal is \"massive\", and will produce a \"bumper run\". Shark nets have been removed to the south of Durban. The first shoals were expected to reach Amanzimtoti on 23 June 2011. The main shoal was still near Port St Johns.\n\nOn 22 June 2011, a \"few\" baskets were netted at Umgababa beach, and a \"handful\" of baskets were netted at Warner Beach in the afternoon. Sardines were also netted at Isipingo, where 14 baskets were hauled out. The sardines therefore reached the Amanzimtoti area a day earlier than predicted.\n\nRough seas (with waves up to 4.7 m) caused by strong winds associated with a cold front kept the sardines from the shore on 23 June 2011. Pockets of sardines were seen far out to sea off the Bluff. The rough water and far distance of the sardines from shore made it impossible for the fish to be netted. No dolphin or bird activity was seen in the Durban area associated with the sardines. The main shoal was still suspected to be off the Eastern Cape coastline, with a report of some sardines still seen near Port St Johns on 22 and 23 June 2011.\n\nDurban beaches were the scene of most netting activity on 27 June 2011. \"Hundreds of baskets\" of sardines were hauled onto the beaches in 13 nets. The price per basket was R350 in the morning, but later in the afternoon the price had dropped to R120 per basket. Each net contained in excess of 300 baskets of sardines, with one net containing around 500 baskets. Sardines were also netted at Umhlanga, Port Shepstone, Margate, Umgababa, and Port Edward. Cape gannets and other seabirds were seen \"plunging from considerable heights\" to catch the sardines, especially on the South Coast. Most of the sardines were netted along the Durban beaches as this was the area of calmest waters; swells along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline were around 2.5 m. Shark nets had been removed from Salt Rock to Port Edward, and bathers were requested to consult with lifeguards before entering the water. Meanwhile, a baby dolphin washed up on the beach at Scottburgh, with a gash behind its \"flipper\" (the photo showed a gash between the dorsal fin and the tail) that exposed the spine. The \"weeks old\" dolphin was taken to a nearby paddling pool, but authorities later euthanased it due to the severity of the injuries. Speculation was that the dolphin had been injured by a shark, or by a boat propeller; possibly related to the sardine run.\n\nSwells dropped to 1–1.5 m on 28 June 2011, allowing more netting of sardines. Sardines were netted at Amanzimtoti; on the main beach and at Chain Rocks. A 22-year-old American marine biology student (research diver) named Paulo Edward Stanchi was attacked by a large dusky shark while diving at Aliwal Shoal Marine Protected Area. The group of divers had encountered a pocket of sardines when a 3 m long dusky shark bit Mr Stanchi on his left leg and hands. Mr Stanchi managed to free himself from the shark, and was treated on the diving boat before being transported to Rocky Bay, where medics stabilised him. He was then airlifted to Nkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital, where he underwent surgery. Dusky sharks generally live offshore, but come closer to the shore during the sardine run. The annual sardine run allowed more dusky sharks in the Aliwal Shoal MPA than usual, but there was no reason for them to show any more interest in divers than usual. Mr Stanchi had been wearing split fins with black and grey stripes, and this may have looked like a small shoal of fish to the shark. Meanwhile, a woman in her 40s broke her leg in the frenzy at Amanzimtoti when the sardines were netted. The woman is believed to have been trying to get some of the sardines when she \"stepped wrong\" and fractured her leg. Paramedics stabilized her before transporting her to hospital.\n\n5 July 2011 was a \"quiet day\" for the sardine run. \"Plenty of birds\" were seen diving at Karridene close to the shore. 50 crates of sardines were taken at Umgababa in the early afternoon, while a net of sardines pulled in at Karridene contained some Garrick. More Garrick were caught by fishermen at Karridene, but in general there was little other game fish activity. There was reported to be a \"massive shoal\" of sardines off Coffee Bay in the Eastern Cape.\n\nOn 15 July 2011, 100 baskets were netted at Pennington. It was difficult to predict the sardines' movements as they were staying offshore.\n\nOn 20 July 2011, 300 baskets of sardines were netted at Pennington in the morning. There were lots of gannets off Ballito, and \"quite a bit of fish\" between Park Rynie and Mtwalume.\n\nA strong cold front hit South Africa towards the end of July, causing land surface temperatures to drop below 10 °C over much of the country. Heavy snow falls were experienced in high lying areas, including Nottingham Road, Mooi River and Newcastle in the Midlands, while Van Reenen’s Pass was snowed in. The cold front caused swells of up to 4 meters on the KwaZulu-Natal coast and a 25 to 30 knot wind with rough sea conditions. A ship called the Phoenix ran aground at Salt Rock, Ballito on 26 July 2011 because of the rough conditions. This cold front may have put an end to the 2011 Sardine Run.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2136854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2136854", "title": "1:5:200", "text": "1:5:200\n\nIn the construction industry, the 1:5:200 rule (or 1:5:200 ratio) is a rule of thumb that states that: \n\nThe rule originated in a Royal Academy of Engineering paper by Evans \"et al\".\n\nSometimes the ratios are given as 1:10:200. The figures are averages and broad generalizations, since construction costs will vary with land costs, building type, and location, and staffing costs will vary with business sector and local economy. The RAE paper started a number of arguments about the basis for the figures: whether they were credible: whether they should be discounted; what is included in each category. These arguments overshadow the principal message of the paper that concentration on first capital cost is not optimising use value: support to the occupier and containment of operating-cost. Study by the Constructing Excellence Be Valuable Task Group, chaired by Richard Saxon, came to the view that there is merit in knowing more about key cost ratios as benchmarks and that we can expect wide variation between building types and even individual examples of the same type.\n\nHughes \"et al\", of the University of Reading School of Construction Management and Engineering, observed that the \"Evans ratio\" is merely a passing remark in the paper's introduction (talking of \"commercial office buildings\" and stating that \"similar ratios might well apply in other types of building\") forming part of a pitch that the proportion of a company's expenditure on a building that is spent directly on the building itself (rather than upon staffing it) is around 3%, and that no data are given to support the ratio and no defence of it is given in the remainder of the paper. In attempting to determine this ratio afresh, from published data on real buildings, they found it impossible to reproduce the 1:5:200 ratio, in part because the data and methodology employed by Evans et al. were not published and in part because the definitions employed in the original paper could not be applied. The ratios that they determined were different by an order of magnitude from the 1:5:200 ratio, being approximately 1:0.4:12. They observed that \"everyone else who deals with real numbers\" pitches the percentage somewhere between 10% and 30%, and that their data support 12%.\n\nThey note (as does Clements-Croome) that the three costs for every individual building are affected by a plethora of factors, yielding a wide variation in ratios. They suggest that \"[p]erhaps the original 1:5:200 ratio was simply meant to be a statement to focus clients' attention\" on the importance of considering the higher staffing costs of a building relative to its operating and construction costs, and to encourage people to not be too concerned with higher initial build costs to improve build quality and reduce later lifetime costs. They state that if this is so \"then subsequent users of the ratio have misused it\", and that the frequency of use of the ratio is not problematic, but that the authority and gravitas that are assigned to it is. They conclude that \"perhaps the most worrying feature of this whole discussion is how this passing introductory remark in the paper by Evans \"et al\" has gained the status of a finding from research carried out by the Royal Academy of Engineering, which it most certainly is not!\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2136858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2136858", "title": "Pokémon episodes removed from rotation", "text": "Pokémon episodes removed from rotation\n\nThe \"Pokémon\" anime debuted in Japan on April 1, 1997, with over 1,000+ episodes as of 2018. However, for various reasons, some have been taken out of rotation of reruns in certain countries, while others were altered or completely banned.\n\n aired on TV Tokyo in Japan on December 16, 1997, at 6:30 PM Japan Standard Time. 20 minutes into the episode, there is a scene in which Pikachu stops some vaccine missiles with its Thunderbolt attack, resulting in a huge explosion that rapidly flashes red and blue lights. Although there were similar parts in the episode with red and blue flashes, an anime technique called \"paka paka\" made this scene extremely intense, for these flashes were extremely bright strobe lights, with blinks at a rate of about 12 Hz for about 5 seconds in almost , and then for 2 seconds outright fullscreen.\n\nAt this point, viewers started to complain of blurred vision, headaches, dizziness and nausea. A few people even had seizures, blindness, convulsions, and lost consciousness. Japan's Fire Defense Agency reported a total of 685 viewers, 310 boys and 375 girls, were taken to hospitals by ambulances. Although many victims recovered during the ambulance trip, more than 150 of them were admitted to hospitals. Two people remained hospitalized for over 2 weeks. Some other people had seizures when parts of the scene were rebroadcast during news reports on the seizures. Only a small fraction of the 685 children treated were diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nThe news of the incident spread quickly through Japan. The following day the television station that had aired the episode, TV Tokyo, issued an apology to the Japanese people, suspended the program, and said it would investigate the cause of the seizures. Officers acting on orders from the National Police Agency questioned the program's producers about the cartoon's contents and production process. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare held an emergency meeting, discussing the case with experts and gathering information from hospitals. The series exited the airwaves.\n\nLater studies showed that 5–10% of the viewers had mild symptoms that did not need hospital treatment. 12,000 children reported mild symptoms of illness, but their symptoms more closely resembled mass hysteria than a grand mal seizure. A study following 103 patients over three years after the event found most of them had no further seizures. Scientists believe the flashing lights triggered photosensitive seizures in which visual stimuli like flashing lights can cause altered consciousness. Although about 1 in 4,000 people are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by this \"Pokémon\" episode was unprecedented.\n\nAfter the airing of \"Dennō Senshi Porygon\", the \"Pokémon\" anime took a four-month break, the TV Tokyo red circle logo and the チュシ! text were both removed from the Pokémon Season 1: Indigo League Opening & Ending Credits, the lightning flash has been removed from the Dare da? (だれだ?, Who is it?) segment, and rerun 37 episodes of Pokémon Season 1: Indigo League on Kids Station, and they showed the EP039 Pikachu's Goodbye Preview until it returned on April 16, 1998. After the hiatus, the time slot changed from Tuesday to Thursday. The opening theme was also redone, and black screens showing various Pokémon in spotlights were broken up into four images per screen, opening animation ends just the テレビ東京 logo without the TV Tokyo red circle logo and without the チュシ! text, also, the Dare da? (だれだ?, Who is it?) segment was also redone, it starts with a black screen without the lightning flash, and it continues on the blue screen without the lightning flash. Before the seizure incident, the opening was originally one Pokémon image per screen, the opening animation ends was originally showing the TV Tokyo red circle logo and the チュシ! text, the Dare da (だれだ?, Who is it?) segment was originally have the lightning flash. Before the resumption of broadcast, was shown. Broadcast in Japan on April 11, 1998, host Miyuki Yadama went over the circumstances of the program format and the on-screen advisories at the beginning of animated programs, as well as showing letters and fan drawings sent in by viewers, most of whom were concerned that the incident would lead to the anime being cancelled. The seizures were actually caused by animation errors. After that episode aired, prior episodes with seizure-like effects were edited for rebroadcasting (especially the non-Japanese releases).\n\n4Licensing Corporation (formerly 4Kids Entertainment and originally Leisure Concepts) did dub this episode in the United States, although the validity of this statement has been questioned.\n\nIn \"Battle of the Quaking Island! Dojoach (Barboach) vs. Namazun (Whiscash)!!\" Ash Ketchum has just finished the Mossdeep City Gym, and his next goal is the final Gym at Sootopolis City. Ash and friends journey toward Jojo Island on the way and are caught in an earthquake caused by Whiscash. They then meet a Pokémon trainer named Chōta.\n\nThe episode was originally set to air in Japan on November 4, 2004, but was skipped due to the episode's similarities to the Chūetsu earthquake on October 23, 2004. The episode was later postponed, but was skipped in rotation order and eventually discontinued. While most of the other episodes were either not dubbed for English-language release or taken out of English-language syndication rotations, this episode of \"Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation\" was the second episode not to air outside of Japan, and the first episode not to air in Japan. Since then the move Earthquake alongside similar moves such as Fissure and Magnitude have not been used in the anime.\n\nThe two-part episode \"Team Rocket vs. Team Plasma!\" was originally scheduled to be broadcast on March 17 and March 24, 2011. The Pokémon Smash episode on the week that would've followed by the first part was preempted from broadcast due to the news coverage of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, before being postponed due to the content of the episodes wherein Castelia City is destroyed. There were plans for the episodes to be broadcast at a later date, but the episode was never actually aired. Footage from this episode was later used in the episode \"Meloetta and the Undersea Temple\" which aired on September 27, 2012, as well as in \"Strong Strategy Steals the Show\", which aired on December 13, 2012.\n\nAnother episode, \"Hiun City Fishing Competition! Fishing Sommelier Dent Appears!!\" was scheduled to air on April 7, 2011, but was postponed due to the tsunami as well. It was later retitled \"Fishing Sommelier Dent Appears!!\" and aired on June 23, 2011, with all references to Hiun (Castelia) City removed to fit into the new continuity.\n\nThe episode \"A Fishing Connoisseur in a Fishy Competition!\" was postponed from its original airdate of April 7, 2011, to June 23, 2011 due to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The episode was originally titled \"Hiun City Fishing Competition! Fishing Sommelier Dent Appears!!\" (ヒウンシティのつり大会！釣りソムリエ・デント登場!! Hiun Shiti no Tsuri Taikai! Tsuri Somurie Dento Tōjō!!), but to fit in with its new airdate, references to the setting of Hiun (Castelia) City were removed.\n\nThe episode \"An Undersea Place to Call Home!\", featuring Ash, Clemont, Serena, and Bonnie helping a Skrelp (Kuzumo) return to its family in a sunken cruise ship, was originally set to broadcast on April 24, 2014. However, the sinking of MV \"Sewol\" led to the episode being pulled from its timeslot with plans for a later broadcast which Japan did eventually see officially on November 20, 2014.\nIt has had its world debut in South Korea on August 8, 2014 right after Episode 824 as originally planned. It also finally made its English debut on February 7, 2015, with the season 18 theme song \"Be a Hero\"\n\nThese seven episodes were postponed from their original air dates of April 26, 2020, May 3, 2020, May 10, 2020, May 17, 2020, May 24, 2020, May 31, 2020 and June 7, 2020 respectively due to the COVID-19 pandemic and replaced with reruns. On May 31, 2020. Pokemon anime will resume on the new episode following COVID-19 state of emergency.\n\nThe Pikachu short Pikachu & Pichu (Japanese: ピチューとピカチュウ) has never been released on video, or shown on TV since 2009 after Noriko Sakai was arrested for possession and abuse of drugs.\n\nThese episodes were never aired outside of Asia (with one notable exception of Episode 18 in the United States).\n\n\"Beauty and the Beach\" is the 18th episode of the original Japanese series. It was the first episode to be originally skipped by 4Licensing Corporation (formerly 4Kids Entertainment and originally Leisure Concepts) upon the original American broadcast of the series until 2000. On June 24, 2000, an English-language version of the episode aired on Kids' WB as \"Beauty and the Beach\". Promoted as a \"lost episode\" special presentation, it has only received one rerun and has not yet been shown elsewhere, nor was it included in the English Indigo League DVD boxset or the English Indigo League Champions Edition Blu-ray boxset released in November 2017.\n\nIn this episode, the female characters all enter a beauty contest. Team Rocket also enters, with James donning a suit with inflatable breasts. One scene of the episode involved James showing off his artificial breasts for humorous effect, taunting Misty by saying: \"Maybe, one day when you're older, you'll have a chest like this!\" In one scene, he puffs up his breasts to over twice their original size. When it was dubbed and aired in 2000, all scenes of James in a bikini (about 40 seconds) were edited. There were a number of other sexualized scenes, such as one in which Ash and Brock are stunned at the sight of Misty in a bikini and another in which an older man appears to be attracted to her. In addition, all Japanese text on signs, etc. remains intact in this episode, as opposed to other first-season episodes in which it was digitally replaced with English text.\n\nA continuity problem created with this episode's removal is due to a flashback in \"Hypno's Naptime\" Also, this episode marks the first time chronologically that Misty and Brock meet Gary and Delia.\n\n was the second episode to be banned by 4Licensing Corporation (formerly 4Kids Entertainment and originally Leisure Concepts). This was the 35th episode of the original Japanese series.\n\nIt was banned due to the frequent appearances of firearms and due to the presence Meowth's Song from Team Rocket throughout the episode. The removal of this episode leads to continuity problems, as Ash captured 29 Tauros in this episode, with a 30th Tauros coming from Brock using one of his Safari Balls. The Tauros appear in later episodes and are used in tournaments by Ash, and only one episode alludes to where they came from.\n\n would have been part of \"\" (season 5), but it was the third episode to be skipped over by 4Licensing Corporation (formerly 4Kids Entertainment and originally Leisure Concepts) and therefore never shown outside of Asia. This episode, much like episode 39 \"\", was banned because of the appearance of the controversial Pokémon Jynx. Some people believed Jynx was a racial stereotype of Africans similar to those from \"The Story of Little Black Sambo\" because of its big pink lips and black skin, or that it looked like a blackface actress. Jynx was later re-edited and given purple skin instead in later episodes. Also, Brock contracts what appears to be SARS.\n\n\"Satoshi (Ash Ketchum) and Nagetukesaru (Passimian)! A Touchdown of Friendship!!\" is the 64th episode of the series \"Pocket Monsters Sun & Moon\". It aired in Japan on March 1, 2018, but never aired in the United States. Although it was never explained why the episode was skipped over, some speculated that the face paint Ash used to disguise himself as a Passimian could resemble blackface.\n\n\"Challenge of the Samurai\" was the first episode to be banned by Seoul Broadcasting System due to a cultural problem. This was the 4th episode of the original Japanese series.\n\nWhile wandering through Viridian Forest, a Samurai challenges Ash to a battle, Samurai has a Pinsir (カイロス, Kairosu), and it turns out to be Metapod vs. Metapod. After a short time, a swarm of Beedrill attacks, and Ash's Metapod is taken by them. Ash is able to rescue his Metapod and it evolves once more into Butterfree.\n\n\"The Ghost of the Maiden's Peak\" was the second episode to be banned by Seoul Broadcasting System for unknown reasons, likely because of the extensive representation of Shinto religious elements in ways that are against Islamic culture. This was the 20th episode of the original Japanese series.\n\nThe boat that Ash and his friends arrive in the port city of Maiden's Peak to attend the Summer's End Festival. Brock and James both fall for a beautiful girl standing by the sea who disappears. Ash, Misty, and Team Rocket learn that she is the ghost of a maiden who waited for her lover to return from an ancient war and eventually turned into stone. While trying to protect Brock and James with some stickers bought from an old woman, the maiden reveals herself as the old woman, who in turn reveals herself to be Gastly (ゴース, Gōsu), a ghost Pokémon. Ash tries to fight Gastly to release James and Brock from its spell but fails, until the sun rises and Gastly is forced to disappear. It is revealed that the ghost of the maiden actually exists and is a friend of Gastly, and is still waiting for the one she loves to return.\n\n\"Pokémon Scent-sation!\" was the third episode to be banned by Seoul Broadcasting System unknown reasons. This was the 26th episode of the original Japanese series.\n\nWhen Ash reaches the Celadon Gym, he is kicked out because of his hatred for perfume, so with the help of Team Rocket (who plotted to steal Erika's special perfume), Ash sneaks into the gym disguised as a girl. In the gym, his disguise is ruined by Misty, Brock, and Pikachu, but the Gym Leader, Erika grants him a battle. During the battle, Team Rocket interrupts and sets the gym on fire. After rescuing Erika's Gloom (クサイハナ, Kusaihana), Ash is presented with the Rainbow Badge.\n\n\"The Ninja-Poké Showdown\" was the fourth episode to be banned by Seoul Broadcasting System, likely because of references to Japanese culture. This was the 32nd episode of the original Japanese series.\n\nThe group finds a strange-looking ninja-style mansion. They explore it and encounter various traps. This ninja girl has a Venonat (コンパン, Konpan). Koga has Venomoth (モルフォン, Morufon) & Golbat (ゴルバット, Gorubatto). Ash's friends saw a Voltorb (ビリリダマ, Biriridama). Soon, they discover that this is the Fuchsia Gym in Fuchsia City (セキチクシティ, Sekichiku Shiti) and Ash battles Koga, the Gym Leader, for the Soul Badge. When Team Rocket disrupts their battle, Misty discovers how powerful her Psyduck really is.\n\n\"Dennō Senshi Porygon\" was the fifth episode to be banned by Seoul Broadcasting System. This was the 38th episode of the original Japanese series.\n\nAsh and his friends arrive at Pokémon Center where the Monster Ball transfer machine has been causing problems, as the transferred Pokémon never end up at the other side. Ash and his friends decide to accompany Porygon (ポリゴン, Porigon), a computerized Pokémon, used by Professor Akihabara to investigate the problem, only to discover that Team Rocket and another Porygon are to blame.\n\n\"Riddle Me This\" was the sixth episode to be banned by Seoul Broadcasting System due to its references to the Japanese culture and the overall tensions between the two countries. This was the 58th episode of the original Japanese series.\n\nAfter reaching Cinnabar Island (グレン島, Guren Shima), Ash, Brock, and Misty are dismayed to find that the Gym has closed due to crowds of tourists coming to the island and lack of serious trainers. Desperate for his seventh badge, Ash goes around and meets a riddle master who gives him clues about the real Gym's secret location. After finding the Gym in the island's volcano, the riddle master appears and reveals that he is actually Blaine, the Gym Leader Ash has been searching for. Ash begins his battle against Blaine with his first Pokémon, Squirtle who loses to Blaine's Ninetales (キュウコン, Kyūkon) and Charizard simply refusing to battle Blaine's Rhydon. Eventually, Pikachu wins against Rhydon (サイドン, Saidon) but Blaine has a secret weapon up his sleeve in the form of the Fire Pokémon, Magmar (ブーバー, Būbā). With Pikachu's electric attacks rendered useless, Magmar pushes Pikachu closer and closer to the edge of the battlefield. The episode ends in a cliffhanger as it shows Pikachu standing, determined as Magmar's Fire Blast, the most powerful attack that Fire Pokémon have edges ever closer to the Electric Mouse. In the Dare da? (だれだ?, Who is it?) segment, the Japanese audience saw Kas' Pokémon, Electabuzz (エレブー, Erebū).\n\n\"Holiday Hi-Jynx\" was the seventh episode to be banned by Seoul Broadcasting System for unknown reasons. This was the 65th episode of the original Japanese series.\n\nAsh, Misty, Brock, and their Pokémon must return a lost Jynx to Santa before Christmas, with the help of a Lapras. Meanwhile, Jessie attempts to take revenge on Santa for stealing her favorite doll when she was young.\n\n\"Snow Way Out\" was the eighth episode to be banned by Seoul Broadcasting System for unknown reasons. This was the 66th episode of the original Japanese series.\n\nAsh and his friends are trapped in a snowstorm when a strong gust of wind blows Pikachu away, he has a Pidgeotto, and Ash tries to save him. Soon, Ash finds himself separated from the rest of the group, and he and his other Pokémon must brave out the rest of the storm together in a cave.\n\n\"Bad to the Bone!\" was the ninth episode to be banned by Seoul Broadcasting System for unknown reasons. This was the 75th episode of the original Japanese series.\n\nAsh and his friends offer to help Otoshi, a trainer that is heading for the Pokémon League, who has a Marowak, to retrieve his stolen gym badges from Team Rocket.\n\n\"The Fourth Round Rumble (Part 4)\" was the tenth episode to be banned by Seoul Broadcasting System due to Jeanette's Japanese clothing. This was the 79th episode of the original series.\n\nDuring the 4th Round, Gary ends up losing to a trainer named Melissa after Gary's Nidoking is defeated by Melissa's Golem. Meanwhile, Ash faces against his toughest opponent yet, a trainer named Jeanette, who uses a Beedrill, a Scyther, and a Bellsprout. After a hard fought battle, the match ends with Ash victorious, and he moves on to the 5th round, becoming one of the final sixteen members of the tournament.\n\nThese episodes were temporarily removed after the September 11 attacks for destruction of buildings, the name, and/or weapons in the episode.\n\nThis episode was temporarily removed from rotation after the September 11 attacks of 2001, mainly because of the similarities between the attacks and Tentacruel attacking the city. The character Nastina also used military-style weapons during the fight scenes in the episode. However, Tentacruel striking a building was not removed from the dub's opening theme, and the episode is still available on the home video and DVD markets. The episode was aired a month after the September 11 attacks, and was not aired in the US again until the series began airing on Cartoon Network and Boomerang. It was also not shown for a short time in 2005 following Hurricane Katrina as it portrays a city flooded underwater.\n\nThis episode was temporarily withdrawn after the September 11 attacks due to its title. It has since been aired in the regular episode rotation. The episode features Ash and his friends travelling to Lavender Town to catch a Ghost Pokémon in the Pokémon Tower. Ash Ketchum and his Pokémon, Pikachu, ‘died’ during this episode and haunted his friends with the ghost type Pokémon Gastly, Haunter, and Gengar, before his spirit went back into his living body and came back to life. While the episode in question has no similarities to the September 11 attacks, the episode was likely pulled due to the title.\n\n\n"}

In 1872, the headquarters were moved to Rome, and a Central Committee was formed. Since then, the IRC has expanded its operations throughout the entire territory of the country, and has been deployed to face a growing array of activities and emergencies, starting with the Casamicciola earthquake of 1883.\n\nThe American Red Cross has long been active in Italy, working in cooperation with the Italian Red Cross. Ernest Hemingway worked for the American Red Cross in Italy in 1918. The American Red Cross continues to have an office in Naples, Italy.\n\nDuring the Korean War, the Italian Red Cross Field Hospital 68 (\"Ospedale da campo CRI n. 68\") was despatched to Korea to aid the humanitarian disaster there, even though Italy was not a member of the United Nations at the time.

He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1975.\n\nJack Lawrence was born in Brooklyn, New York to an Orthodox Jewish family of modest means as the third of four sons. His parents Barney (Beryl) Schwartz and Fanny (Fruma) Goldman Schwartz were first cousins who had run away from their home in Belaya Tserkov (Bila Tserkva, Ukraine) to go to America in 1904.\n\nLawrence wrote songs while still a child, but because of parental pressure after he graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School, he enrolled in the First Institute of Podiatry where he received a doctoral degree in 1932. The same year, his first song was published and he immediately decided to make a career of songwriting rather than podiatry. That song, \"Play, Fiddle, Play\", won international fame and he became a member of ASCAP that year at age 20.\n\nIn the early 1940s, Lawrence and several fellow hitmakers formed a sensational review called \"Songwriters on Parade\", performing all across the Eastern seaboard on the Loew's and Keith circuits.\n\nLawrence joined the United States Maritime Service during World War II and wrote the official song of the Maritime Service and Merchant Marine, \"Heave Ho! My Lads, Heave Ho!\" as a lieutenant in 1943, while bandleader at Sheepshead Bay Maritime Service Training Station in New York.\n\nOne of Lawrence's first major songs after leaving the service was \"Yes, My Darling Daughter\", introduced by Dinah Shore on Eddie Cantor's radio program. The song was Shore's first record. His song \"If I Didn't Care\" introduced the world to The Ink Spots. And although Frank Sinatra was already a well-known big band singer, Lawrence's \"All or Nothing at All\" was Sinatra's first solo hit.\n\nIn 1946, Lawrence published a song he had written during his tour of duty in World War II. It was released in February 1947 and eventually spent 2 weeks at #1. He wrote it for the then-five-year-old daughter of his attorney, Lee Eastman: Linda Eastman, future first wife of Beatle Paul McCartney. The song was called \"Linda\".\n\nLawrence also wrote the lyrics for \"Tenderly\", Sarah Vaughan's first hit and Rosemary Clooney's trademark song (in collaboration with composer Walter Gross), as well as the English language lyric to \"Beyond the Sea\" (based on Charles Trenet's French language song \"La Mer\"), Bobby Darin's signature song. Another French song for which Lawrence wrote an English lyric was \"La Goualante de Pauvre Jean\", becoming \"The Poor People of Paris\".\n\nTogether with Richard Myers, Lawrence wrote \"Hold My Hand\", which was featured in the film \"Susan Slept Here\" and nominated for the 1954 Academy Award for Best Song. He also wrote the song \"Never Smile at a Crocodile\".\n\n\nLawrence also wrote the lyrics to \"Sleepy Lagoon\", a hit by The Platters. The music to \"Sleepy Lagoon\" was written by Eric Coates in 1940. It was originally a hit for Harry James and his Orchestra in the early 1940s.\n\nLawrence was a gay man and was open about his sexuality later in life. He was the longtime companion of Walter David Myden (birth surname Cohn or Cohen). Myden was born in Cooperstown, New York, in 1915 to Jewish parents who had immigrated from the Russian Empire, much like Lawrence's family. He and Lawrence met while serving in the United States Merchant Marines during World War II. Myden was a psychologist and a social worker at a Los Angeles community council. His UCLA dissertation was published in 1957, on the personalities of creative types, such as composers.\n\nIn 1968, Lawrence and Myden made a sizable donation of 20th-century American art to the then-new American Pavilion of Art and Design at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. The gift was noted in an interview with the couple in the New York Times that made clear that the two were a couple who lived together and were making the donation together, an unusual and brave admission for gay men in pre-Stonewall America.\n\nMyden died suddenly of a heart attack on May 21, 1975, in Los Angeles. Lawrence wrote in his autobiography how surprised and touched he was that his Orthodox Jewish family, which had rarely acknowledged his homosexuality or the existence of their longtime partnership, was gracious and kind to him as he mourned Myden.\n\nIn 1979, Lawrence adopted Richard (\"Rick\") Debnam as his son and heir.\n\nLawrence died on March 16, 2009, at age 96, after a fall at his home in Redding, Connecticut.\n\n"}

It typically comes in waves due to ureteric peristalsis, but may be constant. It is often described as one of the most severe pains.\n\nAlthough this condition can be very painful, kidney stones usually cause no permanent physical damage. The experience is said to be traumatizing due to pain, and the experience of passing blood, blood clots, and pieces of the stone. In most cases, people with renal colic are advised to drink an increased amount of water; in other instances, surgery may be needed. Preventive treatment can be instituted to minimize the likelihood of recurrence.\n\nThe diagnosis of renal colic is same as the diagnosis for the Renal calculus and Ureteric stones.\n\nThe renal colic must be differentiated from the following conditions:\n\n\nMost small stones are passed spontaneously and only pain management is required. Above the rate of spontaneous stone passage decreases. NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as diclofenac or ibuprofen, and antispasmodics like butylscopolamine are used. Although morphine may be administered to assist with emergency pain management, it is often not recommended as morphine is addictive and raises ureteral pressure, worsening the condition. Vomiting is also considered an important adverse effect of opioids, mainly with pethidine. Oral narcotic medications are also often used.\n\nThere is typically no antalgic position for the patient (lying down on the non-aching side and applying a hot bottle or towel to the area affected may help). Larger stones may require surgical intervention for their removal, such as shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Patients can also be treated with alpha blockers in cases where the stone is located in the ureter.\n"}
{"id": "2136884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2136884", "title": "Bernard Brodie (military strategist)", "text": "Bernard Brodie (military strategist)\n\nBernard Brodie (May 20, 1910 – November 24, 1978) was an American military strategist well known for establishing the basics of nuclear strategy. Known as \"the American Clausewitz,\" and \"the original nuclear strategist,\" he was an initial architect of nuclear deterrence strategy and tried to ascertain the role and value of nuclear weapons after their creation.\n\nBrodie was initially a strong supporter of the concept of escalating responses; he promoted the view that a war in Europe would be started with conventional forces and escalate to nuclear only if and when necessary. After a meeting with French counterparts in 1960, he came to espouse a very different policy, one based purely on nuclear deterrence with the stated position that the US would use nuclear arms at the first instance of hostilities of any sort. Brodie felt that anything short of this seriously eroded the concept of deterrence and might lead to situations where one side might enter hostilities believing it could remain non-nuclear. This change in policy made Brodie increasingly at odds with his contemporaries.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Bernard Brodie was the third of four sons of Max and Esther (Bloch) Brodie, immigrants from the Russian Empire. He graduated from the University of Chicago with a Ph.B in 1932, and received a Ph.D in 1940 under Jacob Viner.\n\nBrodie was an instructor at Dartmouth College from 1941 to '43. During World War II, he served in the U.S. Naval Reserve Bureau of Ordnance and at the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. He then taught at Yale University from 1945 to 1951, where he was a member of the Yale Institute of International Studies, and worked at the RAND Corporation as a senior staff member between 1951 and 1966. Brodie was a full professor and taught Political Science and International Relations at UCLA from 1966 until his death in 1978.\n\nHe married Fawn McKay Brodie – who became a well-known biographer of Richard Nixon, Joseph Smith, Thomas Jefferson and others – on August 28, 1936. They were the parents of three children.\n\nInitially a theorist about naval power, Brodie shifted his focus to nuclear strategy after the creation of the nuclear bomb. His most important work, written in 1946, was entitled \"The Absolute Weapon: Atomic Power and World Order\", which laid down the fundamentals of nuclear deterrence strategy. He saw the usefulness of the atomic bomb was not in its deployment but in the threat of its deployment. In a now famous passage he said \"Thus far the chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win wars. From now on its chief purpose must be to avert them. It can have almost no other useful purpose.\" In the early fifties, he shifted out of academia and began work at the RAND Corporation where a stable of important strategists, Herman Kahn and others, developed the rudiments of nuclear strategy and warfighting theory.\n\nWhile working at the RAND Corporation, Brodie wrote \"Strategy in the Missile Age\" (1959) which outlined the framework of deterrence. By arguing that preventative nuclear strikes would lead to escalation from limited to total war, Brodie concluded that deterrence through second strike capability would lead to a more secure outcome for both sides. Due to the virtual abandonment of first strike as a strategy, Brodie suggested investment in civil defense, which included the \"hardening\" of land based missile locations to ensure the strength of the second strike capability. The building of protected missile silos around the United States is a testament to this belief in second strike capability. It was also important for the second strike force to have first strike capabilities to provide the stasis necessary for deterrence. Brodie believed that the second strike force should not be targeted towards cities but towards military installations. This was meant to give the Soviets an opportunity to limit escalation and allow the United States to win the war. Brodie also advocated the funding of conventional military personnel as a means of ensuring communist containment through limited wars or to fight total war if deterrence fails.\n\nBrodie, who had a fascination with Freud and psychoanalysis, sometimes used it to refer to his work in nuclear strategy. In an internally circulated memorandum at the RAND Corporation, Brodie compared his no cities/withhold plan to coitus interruptus, while the SAC plan was like \"going all the way\". Following those comments, fellow RAND scholar Herman Kahn told an assembled group of SAC officers \"Gentlemen, you don't have a war plan, you have a war orgasm!\". Similar sexual imagery was liberally used in Stanley Kubrick's film \"Dr. Strangelove\", a satire of Cold War nuclear strategy. \nBrodie was also responsible, along with Michael Howard and Peter Paret, for making the writings of Carl von Clausewitz more accessible to the English-speaking world. Brodie's incisive \"A guide to the reading of On War\" in the Princeton translation of 1976 corrected most of the misinterpretations of the Prussian's theory and provided students with an accurate synopsis of this vital work.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the seventh Henry to rule Germany, but in order to avoid confusion with the Luxembourg emperor Henry VII, he is usually numbered Henry (VII).\n\nHenry was born in Sicily, the only son of King Frederick II and his first wife, Constance of Aragon. He was the elder brother of Conrad IV, who eventually succeeded him as king.\n\nWhile Frederick sought to be elected German king against his Welf rival Otto IV, he had his new-born son crowned King of Sicily (as Henry II) by Pope Innocent III in March 1212, since an agreement between Frederick and the Pope stated that the kingdoms of Germany and Sicily should not be united under one ruler. For this, the regency of the Sicilian kingdom went to his mother Constance and not to his father. \n\nHowever, after the death of the Pope in 1216, Frederick called his son to Germany, entrusted him with the Duchy of Swabia, and again assumed the title of King of Sicily in 1217. Henry's mother remained as regent in Sicily, now on behalf of her husband, until 1220. After the extinction of the Swabian Zähringen line in 1219 Henry also received their title of a \"Rector of Burgundy\", though that title disappeared when Henry was elected king.\nOn 20/26 April 1220, the German princes assembled at Frankfurt elected Henry King of the Romans, for which the Emperor issued \"Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis\", favoring the prince-bishops. The election had been a condition to Frederick II redeeming his Crusade promises of 1215, because the succession question, in case of the emperor's death on the crusade, was clarified by them. However, Pope Honorius III did not recognize the election and also deprived Henry of his rights over the Sicilian kingdom, because he (just as his predecessor) wanted to prevent the union of both countries. Also, numerous German princes had rejected the election in the first moment.\n\nAfter Frederick II returned to Italy in 1220, Henry was placed under the tutelage of Archbishop Engelbert I of Cologne, who crowned him German king on 8 May 1222, in Aachen. Despite the fact that Henry was formally betrothed to the Přemyslid princess Agnes of Bohemia, daughter of King Ottokar I of Bohemia, Engelbert planned his marriage with Isabella of England, one of the daughters of King John Lackland; however, this union never took place. After Engelbert's death in 1225, Duke Louis I of Bavaria took over the guardianship. The young King was mostly in the care of imperial \"ministeriales\". They also acted as administrators over his Swabian duchy. In the meanwhile, the betrothal between Henry and the Bohemian princess was cancelled.\n\nIn Nürnberg on 29 November 1225, by order of his father, Henry married Margaret of Babenberg, daughter of Duke Leopold VI of Austria, a woman seven years older than he was. Sixteen months later, on 23 March 1227, she was crowned German queen in Aachen. The marriage produced two sons, Henry and Frederick, who both died at a young age.\n\nHenry seems to have been a lively, cultured ruler and kept many \"Minnesänger\" at his court. It is possible he wrote some \"Minnelieder\" (courtly love poetry) himself. He was physically robust, although lame, and about 1.66 m (5' 4½\") tall.\n\nIn 1228, he had a falling-out with Duke Louis of Bavaria, who was suspected of plotting with Pope Gregory IX against Emperor Frederick II. Around Christmas of that year, Henry took over the rule for himself, forced Louis to submit, and then turned against the Bishop of Straßburg. The German princes, angered by his city-friendly policies, forced him however to issue in Worms on 1 May 1231 the \"Statutum in favorem principum\", directed against the cities, and by their complaints turned Frederick II against his son. The emperor was dependent on the support of the princes for his Italian policies against the Pope. Among other things which augmented the discord between father and son, Frederick lifted several regulations Henry had stipulated during his minority years to reduce his authority, and on the other side, the elevation of the Swabian count Egeno V of Urach, a staunch enemy of the Emperor, who became the most important of Henry's advisers.\n\nIn 1232, Frederick came to terms with Pope Gregory, confirmed the \"Statutum\", and had Henry swore obedience in Cividale. In the same year, Henry renewed the league between the Hohenstaufen and the French royal Capetian dynasty. In the following year he entered into a conflict with the House of Wittelsbach and subdued Otto II of the Palatinate, the son of Duke Louis of Bavaria. Frederick, fearing the discontent of the German princes, demanded the release of all hostages. In 1233/34, however, Henry made his father angry again, when he intervened against some inquisition measures, especially the Archbishop of Bremen's crusade against rebellious peasants of Stedingen. Pope Gregory IX, who had authorised the crusade, excommunicated Henry. Emperor Frederick outlawed his son on 5 July 1234 and announced his return to Germany.\n\nHenry revolted and in September formed an alliance with several German bishops and Swabian nobles. However, further negotiations with King Louis IX of France and the Lombard League failed. The princes adopted a wait-and-see stance, while Henry's forces were stuck in fights with the Lords of Hohenlohe, Margrave Herman V of Baden, and the City of Worms. Emperor Frederick, once he had entered Germany, soon gained a large following. When both sides met in Swabia, Henry was forced to submit to his father on 2 July 1235 at Wimpfen Castel, forsaken by most of his followers. Frederick II and the princes tried Henry on 4 July 1235 in Worms and dethroned him. His sons were deprived of the succession jointly with him. Henry's younger brother Conrad was appointed Duke of Swabia instead and also elected King of the Romans.\n\nHenry's allies were mostly pardoned. Frederick II reacted to the weakening of the royal power originated by his dispute with his son, among other things, with the diet in Mainz on 25 August 1235, which for first time passed a law on the public peace (German: \"Landfriedensgesetz\") and fundamentally reformed the Regalia.\n\nHenry was kept prisoner in various places, first in Heidelberg and Alerheim Castle, later in Apulia and at Rocca San Felice in Campania. His seclusion may have been dictated as much by his health as by his rebelliousness: analysis of his skeleton in 1998–1999 has shown that he was suffering from advanced leprosy in his last years. This was perhaps the real cause which prevented the emperor from forgiving him.\n\nPossibly on February 12 (according to other sources February 10), 1242 Henry died near Martirano in Calabria after a fall from his horse when he was moved there from Nicastro. Some chroniclers report that it had been an attempted suicide. His father had him buried with royal honours in the cathedral of Cosenza, in an antique Roman sarcophagus.\n\nFrederick, the only surviving son of Henry (VII), was named in the testament of his grandfather Frederick II, were the Emperor entrusted him with the Duchy of Austria, the Marquisate of Styria and 10,000 uncias. His death in 1251 was recorded by Matthew Paris, who claimed that both he and his older brother were poisoned (\"veneno interfecit\").\n\nAmong the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, Henry is numbered only in parentheses, as he did not exercise the sole kingship. He is not to be confused with the later emperor Henry VII who actually ruled the Empire from 1308 onwards.

His family moved to Canada when he was eight years old. Problems within his dysfunctional family led him to quit school at the age of 14. \n\nChetwynd returned the following year but was promptly expelled. He then enlisted in the Canadian Army. After serving with The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada, Chetwynd turned his life around.\n\nHe walked into Sir George Williams University — now Montreal's Concordia University — and waited two hours to meet its principal, Henry F. Hall, who had a reputation for giving students a second chance. After a battery of tests, Chetwynd received conditional admittance as a mature student.\n\nChetwynd became an honours student in philosophy and economics. He also championed Sir George Williams University on televised youth panels and in debating competitions. Shortly after graduating as valedictorian, Chetwynd married future Hollywood actor Gloria Carlin, whom he met at Sir George.\n\nHe excelled to the point that he earned a scholarship to Montreal's McGill University Law School. At McGill law he served as a contributing editor for the \"McGill Law Journal\".\n\nWhile a law student he also found employment at the beginning of preparations for the forthcoming Expo67, beginning as a laborer on the man-made islands. He quickly found a transfer to the Critical Path Section and then was moved into the Entertainment Branch. By January, 1967, three months before the opening of the fair, he had risen to a senior position within the E Branch with responsibility for approving all media licenses to the fair with the title \"Directeur de Reproduction, Terre des Hommes\" (Director of Reproduction, Man and World)\n\nAfter obtaining his degree, Chetwynd did graduate work in law in the United Kingdom at Trinity College, Oxford. After completing his studies, he remained in London, working for Columbia Pictures's distribution branch where he worked his way up to assistant managing director. Pursuing an interest in writing screenplays, after he met Canadian film director Ted Kotcheff, Chetwynd co-wrote the script for the film \"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz\" with fellow Montrealer Mordecai Richler who had written the novel from which it was adapted.\n\nWith the script complete, Chetwynd moved to New York City, where the 1974 release of \"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz\" saw his career get a big boost when he won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium and a nomination for the Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay. In 1975 he wrote and produced \"Goldenrod\" starring his wife Gloria Carlin and Tony LoBianco, and in that same year wrote and produced \"Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye\" (A Christopher Award winner), the story of John Kennedy's first run for congress, based on the book by Dave Powers and Kenny O'Donnell. In 1977, he was hired by Marlo Thomas to pen a gender-reversal made-for-television version of \"It's a Wonderful Life\" entitled \"It Happened One Christmas\", in which Thomas played the lead role portrayed by James Stewart in the original.\n\nHired to write scripts for CBS (Love of Life) and PBS television networks, Chetwynd soon turned to directing his own screenplays, meeting with success for his 1978 film \"Two Solitudes\". Adapted by Chetwynd from the Hugh MacLennan book, and starring Jean-Pierre Aumont, Stacy Keach, and Claude Jutra, the film dealt with societal issues relative to Canada's French and English speaking population and the Conscription Crisis of 1917. The film marked a turning point for Chetwynd and he would go on to write, direct, and produce numerous issue or event-based American films.\n\nA supporter of Ronald Reagan, Chetwynd's work, pronouncements, and endorsement of conservative ideologies, made him a favorite of the political right in the United States. \n\nChetwynd's diverse film works include productions such as the 1981 made for television story \"Miracle on Ice\" (Christopher Award) that recounted the U.S. ice hockey team's dramatic upset victory over the Soviet Union at the 1980 Winter Olympics. Under the pen name Peter Dion, he scripted \"The Hot Touch\" for which he received a Canadian Genie nomination but which, sadly, was both the last film directed by Roger Vadim and the last film that included Melvin Douglas. A member of the National Sponsoring Committee of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, Chetwynd wrote and directed the 1987 drama \"The Hanoi Hilton\" that dealt with the treatment of American P.O.W.s during the Vietnam War in Hanoi's notorious Hoa Lo prison. That year he was commissioned to create and write a special tribute to the United States Congress as part of the Constitutional Bicentennial celebration.\n\nIn 1988, Chetwynd also wrote the four-hour miniseries for A&E Television, \"To Heal a Nation\"(George Washington Medal), a biopic of Jan Scruggs, a Vietnam veteran who returned home disillusioned and disenchanted, later founding the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. He also wrote and helped produce the gala that celebrated the 200th anniversary of the U.S. Constitution starring Ben Vereen, that was presented in Philadelphia before members of congress and the Supreme Court. His 1983 \"Sadat\" starring Lou Gossett, which was cited by the NAACP Image Awards, was the first OPT mini-series. He produced the Christopher Award-winning \"Evil in Clear River\".\n\nFrom 1992 to 1996 he executive produced, wrote, and frequently directed episodes of the PBS series \"Reverse Angle\" and its successor \"National Desk\", public affairs series that earned multiple Telly Awards and a New York Festival Gold Medal. In 1993 he wrote \"Heroes of Desert Storm\" (directed by Don Ohlmeyer). Among his other issue-based works, Chetwynd wrote the screenplay and produced the Genie-nominated \"Kissinger and Nixon\" (1995), \"Color of Justice\" (1997) and wrote the scripts for \"\", a four-hour miniseries for CBS, and \"The Man Who Captured Eichmann\". In 1999 he wrote the teleplay for the ABC miniseries, \"Tom Clancy's Net Force\".\n\nChetwynd has also made biblical films, notably \"Jacob\" (1994), \"Joseph\" (1996 - Emmy winner, Best Miniseries) and \"Moses\" (1996), which was also nominated for an Emmy; the later two were both nominated for Emmys.\n\nIn 2001, Chetwynd wrote and directed \"Varian's War\", the story of Varian Fry, an American who helped numerous intellectuals and artists escape from Nazi-occupied France during World War II. The film earned Chetwynd his fifth Writers Guild of American \"Best Screenplay\" nomination, as well as a special citation from The American Society of Yad Vashem and the Jewish Image Award for best film.\n\nIn 2001, Chetwynd was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve on the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities. In 2003, Chetwynd wrote and produced \"\", a docudrama for Showtime Networks recounting the nine days in the Bush administration between the time of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon and the president's televised address to the nation before Congress.\n\nIn 2002, Chetwynd wrote, produced and directed \"\", a PBS documentary that recounted the life and career of American Communist Party member Carl Foreman. The story deals with events during McCarthyism that saw Foreman, a talented film producer and screenwriter, blacklisted by the Hollywood movie studio bosses in the 1950s.\n\nAfter \"Darkness at High Noon,\" he subsequently received an Emmy nomination for writing and producing \"\" starring Tom Selleck, and wrote and produced the political documentary \"Celsius 41.11\" and the historical film \"We Fight To Be Free\".\n\nChetwynd continued his work in documentaries, notably producing and directing \"An Improbable Dream\" (2016) which traced the lives of students of Canada's National Ballet School from their 10th and 11th birthdays into their early 50s. It met with great success, receiving New York Festival Gold Medals for both directing and also producing, as well as a People's Telly Award. During this time he has worked on several other projects including a series for FX and a mini-series dealing with the end of the Cold War and the Armenian genocide.\n\nChetwynd has more than 60 longform and feature credits and over two dozen documentary credits, which have received numerous citations including six Writers Guild of America nominations (including an award), New York Film festival Gold Medal, two Christophers, six Tellys, two Genie nominations and two George Washington medals from the Freedom Foundation at Valley Forge.\n\nIn 2003, Chetwynd received the Caucus of Writers, Producers and Directors Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 2011 he received their Writer of the Year award. In 2003 he was also conferred an honorary doctorate by Columbia College-Hollywood. In 2008, he received the John Singleton Copley Medal from the National Portrait Gallery/Smithsonian.\n\nIn 2004, Chetwynd became a founding member of Friends of Abe, an organization of Hollywood conservatives.\n\nChetwynd appeared with Roger L. Simon, founder of Pajamas Media, in the internet's Pajamas TV's (PJTV) \"Poliwood\" show, discussing topics that cover the intersection of politics and Hollywood.\n\nChetwynd is married to actress Gloria Carlin, who has appeared in several of his films. They have two sons and reside in Beverly Hills, California.\n\n"}

Green helped his father on the family farm, and in winter months he attended school. At age 14 he was apprenticed to a carpenter in the county, but he returned home after one month. At age 16 he was sent to live with his brother in Columbus to learn cabinetmaking, but his apprenticeship ended after only two weeks. Green left home and found employment as a Columbus store clerk, a job that lasted four years. When a recruiter from the Mountain Rifle Regiment opened an office in Columbus in 1846, Green and a friend enlisted in the army. Green was promoted to sergeant at Newport, Kentucky, after one month of duty.\n\nGreen entered the army July 1, 1846. he fought in the Mexican–American War under General Winfield Scott as a first sergeant of the U.S. Mounted Rifles. He was discharged in August 1848, but he re-enlisted with the same regiment in September 1852. By the time the American Civil War began, Green was a first lieutenant of the 2nd Dragoons. On August 13, 1861 he was promoted to captain and served with the same regiment throughout the war, though it was renamed the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. He received a brevet promotion to major for service at the Battle of Gettysburg and to lieutenant colonel for service during the war.\n\nGreen was promoted to major of the 1st Cavalry Regiment in June 1868, and fought against the Apaches in Arizona. He was in command at Fort Klamath, Oregon when the Modoc War began. He received the Medal of Honor during the First Battle of the Stronghold though the U.S. forces were defeated. Colonel Alvan C. Gillem, commanding officer of the 1st Cavalry, assumed command of the expedition against the Modocs. Green commanded a battalion of cavalry and infantry under Gillem during the Second Battle of the Stronghold in which U.S. forces succeeded in capturing Captain Jack's Stronghold. Green retired in 1889 after serving as commander of Fort Boise and alternately as commander of Fort Walla Walla. He received a brevet promotion to brigadier general in 1890.\n\nAt the First Battle of the Stronghold during the Modoc War Green's men displayed a reluctance to fight Modoc warriors, who had been inflicting casualties on their unit. Green left cover, and, standing in full view of the Modoc warriors, proceeded to pace in front of his men, slapping his gloves in his palm for emphasis. Although exposed to enemy fire, Green survived, although he was injured, and remained in command.\n\nRank and Organization: Major, 1st U.S. Cavalry. Place and Date: At the Lava Beds, Calif., January 17, 1873. Entered Service At: Ohio. Birth: Germany. Date of Issue: November 18, 1897.\n\nIn order to reassure his command, this officer, in the most fearless manner and exposed to very great danger, walked in front of the line; the command, thus encouraged, advanced over the lava upon the Indians who were concealed among the rocks.\n"}

He has had an extensive and successful career both at club and international level. He led both Ajax and Feyenoord to Dutch championships and also had domestic success with Real Madrid. At international level, he led Trinidad and Tobago to the 2006 FIFA World Cup and Poland to UEFA Euro 2008, both firsts for each nation. His role in Spanish football has earned him the nickname Don Leo, largely due to his fondness of cigars and dry humour.\n\nBeenhakker has been the coach of several prestigious clubs including Ajax, Feyenoord, Real Madrid, and Real Zaragoza. He has also coached the national teams of Saudi Arabia, Poland and the Netherlands. He coached the Trinidad and Tobago national team in the year leading up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Under Beenhakker's guidance, the team managed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, where the team secured a 0–0 draw against Sweden in their first match, and gave England cause for concern in the second match.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2003, Beenhakker was director of technical affairs with Ajax. In that period, he fired head coach Co Adriaanse and replaced him with Ronald Koeman.\n\nOn 11 July 2006, Beenhakker was appointed as the manager of the Poland national team. Originally, he was appointed to manage Poland until the end of UEFA Euro 2008, however his contract was extended until November 2009, the end of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup. On 17 November 2007, after Poland defeated Belgium 2–0, he managed to qualify Poland for the UEFA European Championship for their first time – even in Poland's \"golden years\" of the 1970s and '80s, the nation never qualified for the Euro final stages. On 20 February 2008, Beenhakker was decorated with the Order of Polonia Restituta by President of Poland Lech Kaczyński. The Order is conferred for outstanding achievements in the fields of education, science, sport, culture, art, economics, defense of the country, social work, civil service, or for furthering good relations between countries. However, after Poland's failure to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, Beenhakker was sacked.\n\nWhile still in charge of Poland, Feyenoord hired Beenhakker on 5 May 2007 as an interim coach to lead the club through the 2006–07 play-offs. After his departure from Poland, he was named the sports director of the club, signing a contract on 9 October 2009 lasting until 30 June 2011.\n\nFollowing his spell in the Netherlands, Beenhakker agreed on a three-year deal with Hungarian first division side Újpest, and was officially introduced as the new sports director of \"the purple-whites\" in a press conference on 29 July 2011. As managing director Csaba Bartha revealed, Beenhakker's main duty was to work with the first team. However, the club also intended to use his diverse and extensive personal relationships to establish a scouting network across Europe, which could be used in both directions. His contract was terminated in October 2011, after Belgian businessman Roderick Duchatelet, son of Roland Duchâtelet, purchased the club.\n\nSince November 2017, Beenhakker has been technical advisor at Sparta Rotterdam.\n\nBeenhakker speaks several languages, including Dutch, English and Spanish.

{"id": "2136925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2136925", "title": "Lip", "text": "Lip\n\nLips are a visible body part at the mouth of many animals, including humans.\n\nLips are soft, movable, and serve as the opening for food intake and in the articulation of sound and speech. Human lips are a tactile sensory organ, and can be an erogenous zone when used in kissing and other acts of intimacy.\n\nThe upper and lower lips are referred to as the \"Labium superius oris\" and \"Labium inferius oris\", respectively. The juncture where the lips meet the surrounding skin of the mouth area is the vermilion border, and the typically reddish area within the borders is called the vermilion zone. The vermilion border of the upper lip is known as the cupid's bow. The fleshy protuberance located in the center of the upper lip is a tubercle known by various terms including the procheilon (also spelled \"prochilon\"), the \"tuberculum labii superioris\", and the \"labial tubercle\". The vertical groove extending from the procheilon to the nasal septum is called the philtrum.\n\nThe skin of the lip, with three to five cellular layers, is very thin compared to typical face skin, which has up to 16 layers. With light skin color, the lip skin contains fewer melanocytes (cells which produce melanin pigment, which give skin its color). Because of this, the blood vessels appear through the skin of the lips, which leads to their notable red coloring. With darker skin color this effect is less prominent, as in this case the skin of the lips contains more melanin and thus is visually darker. The skin of the lip forms the border between the exterior skin of the face, and the interior mucous membrane of the inside of the mouth.\n\nThe lip skin is not hairy and does not have sweat glands. Therefore, it does not have the usual protection layer of sweat and body oils which keep the skin smooth, inhibit pathogens, and regulate warmth. For these reasons, the lips dry out faster and become chapped more easily.\n\nThe lower lip is formed from the mandibular prominence, a branch of the first pharyngeal arch. The lower lip covers the anterior body of the mandible. It is lowered by the depressor labii inferioris muscle and the orbicularis oris borders it inferiorly.\n\nThe upper lip covers the anterior surface of the body of the maxilla. Its upper half is of usual skin color and has a depression at its center, directly under the nasal septum, called the philtrum, which is Latin for \"lower nose\", while its lower half is a markedly different, red-colored skin tone more similar to the color of the inside of the mouth, and the term \"vermillion\" refers to the colored portion of either the upper or lower lip.\n\nIt is raised by the levator labii superioris and is connected to the lower lip by the thin lining of the lip itself.\n\nThinning of the vermilion of the upper lip and flattening of the philtrum are two of the facial characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome, a lifelong disability caused by the mother's consumption of alcohol during pregnancy.\n\nThe skin of the lips is stratified squamous epithelium. The mucous membrane is represented by a large area in the sensory cortex, and is therefore highly sensitive. The \"Frenulum Labii Inferioris\" is the frenulum of the lower lip. The \"Frenulum Labii Superioris\" is the frenulum of the upper lip.\n\n\nThe facial artery is one of the six non-terminal branches of the external carotid artery.\n\nThis artery supplies both lips by its superior and inferior labial branches. Each of the two branches \"bifurcate\" and \"anastomose\" with their companion branch from the other terminal.\n\nThe muscles acting on the lips are considered part of the muscles of facial expression. All muscles of facial expression are derived from the mesoderm of the second pharyngeal arch, and are therefore supplied (motor supply) by the nerve of the second pharyngeal arch, the facial nerve (7th cranial nerve). The muscles of facial expression are all specialized members of the panniculus carnosus, which attach to the dermis and so wrinkle, or dimple the overlying skin. Functionally, the muscles of facial expression are arranged in groups around the orbits, nose and mouth.\n\nThe muscles acting on the lips:\n\nBecause they have their own muscles and bordering muscles, the lips are easily movable. Lips are used for eating functions, like holding food or to get it in the mouth. In addition, lips serve to close the mouth airtight shut, to hold food and drink inside, and to keep out unwanted objects. Through making a narrow funnel with the lips, the suction of the mouth is increased. This suction is essential for babies to breast feed. Lips can also be used to suck in other contexts, such as sucking on a straw to drink liquids.\n\nThe lips serve for creating different sounds—mainly labial, bilabial, and labiodental consonant sounds as well as vowel rounding—and thus are an important part of the speech apparatus. The lips enable whistling and the performing of wind instruments such as the trumpet, clarinet, flute, and saxophone. People who have hearing loss may unconsciously or consciously lip read to understand speech without needing to perceive the actual sounds.\n\nThe lip has many nerve endings and reacts as part of the tactile (touch) senses. Lips are very sensitive to touch, warmth, and cold. It is therefore an important aid for exploring unknown objects for babies and toddlers.\n\nBecause of their high number of nerve endings, the lips are an erogenous zone. The lips therefore play a crucial role in kissing and other acts of intimacy.\n\nA woman's lips are also a visible expression of her fertility. In studies performed on the science of human attraction, psychologists have concluded that a woman's facial and sexual attractiveness is closely linked to the makeup of her hormones during puberty and development. Contrary to the effects of testosterone on a man's facial structure, the effects of a woman's oestrogen levels serve to maintain a relatively \"childlike\" and youthful facial structure during puberty and during final maturation. It has been shown that the more oestrogen a woman has, the larger her eyes and the fuller her lips, characteristics which are perceived as more feminine. Surveys performed by sexual psychologists have also found that universally, men find a woman's full lips to be more sexually attractive than lips that are less so. A woman's lips are therefore sexually attractive to males because they serve as a biological indicator of a woman's health and fertility. A woman's lipstick (or collagen lip enhancement) attempts to take advantage of this fact by creating the illusion that a woman has more oestrogen than she actually has, and thus that she is more fertile and attractive.\n\nLip size is linked to sexual attraction in both men and women. Women are attracted to men with masculine lips, that are more middle size and not too big or too small; they are to be rugged and sensual. In general, the researchers found that a small nose, big eyes and voluptuous lips are sexually attractive both in men and women. The lips may temporarily swell during sexual arousal due to engorgement with blood.\n\nThe lips contribute substantially to facial expressions. The lips visibly express emotions such as a smile or frown, iconically by the curve of the lips forming an up-open or down-open parabola, respectively. Lips can also be made pouty when whining, or perky to be provocative.\n\nAs an organ of the body, the lip can be a focus of disease or show symptoms of a disease:\n\n\nLips are often viewed as a symbol of sensuality and sexuality. This has many origins; above all, the lips are a very sensitive erogenous and tactile organ. Furthermore, in many cultures of the world, a woman's mouth and lips are veiled because of their representative association with the vulva, and because of their role as a woman's secondary sexual organ.\n\nAs part of the mouth, the lips are also associated with the symbolism associated with the mouth as orifice by which food is taken in. The lips are also linked symbolically to neonatal psychology (see for example oral stage of the psychology according to Sigmund Freud).\n\nLip piercing or lip augmentation is sometimes carried out for cosmetic reasons. Products designed for use on the lips include lipstick, lip gloss and lip balm.\n\nIn most vertebrates, the lips are relatively unimportant folds of tissue lying just outside the jaws. However, in mammals, they become much more prominent, being separated from the jaws by a deep cleft. They are also more mobile in mammals than in other groups, since it is only in this group that they have any attached muscles. In some teleost fish, the lips may be modified to carry sensitive barbels. In birds and turtles, the lips are hard and keratinous, forming a solid beak. Clevosaurids like \"Clevosaurus\" are notable for the presence of bone \"lips\"; in these species the tooth-like jaw projections common to all sphenodontians form a beak-like edge around the jaws, protecting the teeth within.\n\n\n\n"}

Conquest of Elysium is a fantasy turn-based strategy game. The game can be played with up to eight human players. Single player against computer is possible. The game can run on very old computers and has support for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X and Solaris.\n\nThe goal of the game is the elimination of other players by either eliminating their commanders or capturing their citadels. In the start the player can choose whether he wants to create a random map or load a scenario. Random maps ask not only the size of the map and the amount of some terrain features but they also require the player the select the so-called society the map will be based on. The societies range from early human settlements to a crumbled central empire. The societies affect how many settlements there will be, what kind of non-player creatures threaten the players and what kind of general shape the map takes. For example, the \"Monarchy\" setting has independent castles surrounded by farms and minor settlements as a dominant feature.\n\nNext choice is what character to play. There are nineteen different characters to play. The characters are split into Warlords, Magic users, Priests and Non-humans. The character is in practice the \"nation\" the player selects. Different characters have different strengths and require vastly different playstyles. Warlords have strong military units and occasionally some special features such as the ability to levy soldiers or construct watchtowers. Magic users gather some unique resource and their strength is in their summoned or constructed creatures. Priests differ greatly from each other but they have either need to capture civilized settlements, either for converts or blood sacrifices, in order to use their powers which are at best quite apocalyptic or they need to gather herbs or fungi and use them for summoning or spiritual attacks.\n\nThe game map, made out of separate terrain tiles, is littered with different terrain types and locations such as old battlefields, settlements of varying size, mines and locations which can be used as additional citadels. Some locations have other uses for different player characters. Seasons change and affect the amount of money you get and how some spells work. Winter greatly reduces tax income and herbs and fungi don't grow.\n\nThe game is heavily combat oriented as the control of your nation is basically limited to buying units or changing the tax. Units are recruited centrally and are deployed into special structures called \"citadels\" which range from castles to wooden watchtowers. Large cities also double as citadels. The units cannot be moved without a commander who can command troops. Troops range from spearmen to siege engines and mythological and imaginary creatures of varying strength.\n\nCombat is handled in a separate combat mode: when two armies clash the game calculates combat results in the turn generation and the player gets to see the battles during the turn generation. The combat is completely automated and the player can only watch once the combat starts. The opposing armies line against each other. Some units have special abilities which come into play in combat. The combat's graphical presentation is simple: the only things displayed are the units on a black background and the possible walls protecting the defenders. Sound effects are few and simple as are spell effects.\n\nThe game's interface is partially usable by both mouse and partially keyboard only. While this ensues that the game runs in truly minimally equipped computers it also makes the interface somewhat awkward to use.\n\nDespite being Illwinter's least known game they have continued to support it and latest patch was released in 2014. On August 15, 2011, Illwinter announced development of \"Conquest of Elysium III.\"\n\n"}

It is from the capital city of San Fernando and from Metro Manila. The town is bounded on the north by the towns of Bacolor and Santa Rita; on the south by the towns of Sasmuan and Lubao; on the east, Macabebe and Sasmuan; and on the west, Porac and Floridablanca.\n\n\"Wawa\" (Lán-nâng: 偎岸, \"Hua-hua\"), which means \"river mouth\" (Kapampangan: \"alua\" or \"bukana\"), was the earliest recorded form of the town's name according to records dating back to 1590. The town is strategically located along a river which played a vital role in trade and transportation during the precolonial era.\n\nWawa was already a prosperous settlement when Spanish colonists took control of the town in the year 1561, from then on calling it \"Guagua\", which is a Hispanised form of the original name. Indeed, archeological artifacts have been excavated in a nearby town which affirmed the existence of a prehistoric community in Guagua.\n\nEarly inhabitants opted to stay in the town because it was here that they could engage in barter trade with people from different islands, along with other means of livelihood like fishing and farming. The navigable river with which the town was endowed allowed shipping vessels to transport commodities to and from other chief localities, particularly the imperial Manila. The first cargo boat to arrive in Guagua was the \"Doña Dominga\" on 7 May 1884. Much later it was followed by the steamships \"Kaibigan\" and \"Kababayan\", which anchored at the pier in Bgy Santo Niño, better known as the Yañgco Landing.\n\nIn 1892, when the Manila–Mabalacat railroad was inaugurated, Guagua was virtually the port of embarkation to and from Manila that served the province. Commerce was further improved when the San Fernando–Guagua line of the railroad was chartered on 17 November 1907.\n\nThe Chinese have long been part in Guagua's social and economic mainstream. In the 18th century, they sought refuge in the town to escape discrimination and persecution in Manila. After their near-total slaughter, the Chinese lived in relative peace while they freely practiced their craft and mingled hand-in-hand with the local residents. The Chinese residents were merchants, masons, woodcarvers, carpenters, agriculturists and labourers. Their influence on the cultural and economic life of Guagua cannot be overlooked. The town could not have prospered so well without the economic services provided by the Chinese.\n\nThe town took significant part in the revolutionary struggles against the foreign intruders. A house near a church was made a secret cell of the Katipuneros in August 1897. In March 1898, a massacre of all Spanish sympathisers in Guagua marked the end of Spanish colonialism and the outset of American rule. Moreover, during the Philippine–American War and the ensuing Second World War, Guagua became an important battleground.\n\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, a new system of education was introduced and made popular and available to the Filipinos. The Guagua Elementary School in Bgy Santa Filomena, is believed to be the first to be established in the town in the year 1901. Later in that year, an English teacher came to Betis district and opened a primary school which functioned on a regular basis. In 1908, Colegio del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús (now St Mary's Academy in Bgy San Roque) was established in a two-storey building donated by a charitable matron, in downtown Guagua. Later in 1918, Guagua National Institute (now Guagua National Colleges in Bgy Santa Filomena) was founded at the convent of the Catholic church. Further, in 1941, the then-parish priest felt the need for another high school in town, so he opened Saint Michael's College.\n\nAt the overthrow of the Marcos dictatorship in 1986, the local government carried out a sustainable development program to address the town's destitute state. From its income classification in 1986 as a third-class municipality, Guagua grew to a first-class one. Guagua garnered several outstanding citations for its achievement, including of several \"Most Outstanding LGU\" awards.\n\nGuagua was severely devastated by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991.\n\nThe town is mostly flat and is suitable to any kind of development; agricultural, industrial, commercial and others. It is only a meter above sea level.\n\nIn general, the soils of Guagua are of recent alluvial origin consisting of fine sand, silt loam and hydrosol. The average chemical analysis of its top soils is : nitrogen, 0.02 to 0.1; phosphorus, 0.06 to 0.28; potassium, 0.46 to 1.74; organic carbon, 0.41 to 3.02; and pH value (acidity and alkalinity), 5.61 to 6.99\n\nThe climate and topographical features of the vast land of Guagua make it ideal for the growing of fruit trees and vegetables. Among the fruit trees most fitting to be planted are mangoes, guavas, santol, star apples, and bananas. For vegetables, sitao, upo, ampalaya, gabi and cucumber are the most commonly produced by farmers and which thrive best in the community.\n\nBeing void of forest areas, its fauna are mostly the domesticated ones like, chicken, ducks, cattle, and others.\n\nGuagua is divided into four (4) districts, subdivided into 31 barangays:\n\nSan Rafael was constituted from Dock Island in 1956.\n\nIn the , the population of Guagua, Pampanga, was people, with a density of .\n\nRoman Catholic 88%, Members Church of God International 4%, Iglesia ni Cristo 3%, Seventh-day Adventists 3%, Others (Including Buddhism,Islam and Other Religionist) 2%.\n\nLike other towns in the Philippines, Guagua is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the town's departments in executing the ordinances and improving public services. The vice mayor heads a legislative council (Sangguniang Bayan) consisting of councilors from the Barangays of Barrios.\n\nThe seat of Government is vested upon the Mayor and other elected officers who hold office at the Town hall. The Sanguniang Bayan is the center of legislation.\n\nFor elementary and high school education, Guagua has numerous schools.\n\n\nThe town has interesting culture and heritage attractions and landmarks, including Rufino Santos Catholic Center, Capt. Ruben P. Sonco Freedom Square, Monument of Aurelio Tolentino (1867-1915). The Guagua National Colleges is also declared as a national historical landmark by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines during the college's 75th Foundation anniversary in 1993.\n\nThe 1607 Santiago Apostol Parish Church, commonly known as Betis Church is a Baroque (heritage) Church, located in Guagua, Pampanga (Betis Area). It is a Spanish-era church declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines and the NCCA (under R.A. 4896 as amended by P.D. 374 and R.A. 8492), on November 5, 2001 (one of only 26 churches in the country bestowed that honor). It is part of the Ecclesiastical Provinces of the Archdiocese of San Fernando. In 2009, the National Museum installed a marker of its 2005 Proclamation.\n\nThe first church edifice was constructed in 1587 but was unfortunately razed by fire. The current Church structure was constructed in 1772 under the administration of the Augustinians. The Church was greatly improved in 1862 until 1870. The interiors are simple and the centerpiece attraction is the main altar, a creation of noted local artist Willy Layug. While still simple, the exteriors on the other hand, are marked by massive strength. The Cathedral-type church is located immediately adjacent to the Guagua Municipal Building and houses the Cardinal Santos Catholic Center and the Immaculate Conception Parochial School.\n\n"}

Influenced by the French La Pléiade, his poetry introduced Renaissance forms and themes previously unknown in German verse. \n\nIn his political career, Weckherlin worked in the service of the Electorate of the Palatinate, serving on diplomatic missions to France and England. Weckherlin would eventually come to be employed by the English crown as an expert on foreign languages and cryptography, and continued to serve in this position in the Commonwealth of England.\n\nGeorg Weckherlin was born at Stuttgart. After studying law in Tübingen he settled at Stuttgart, and, as secretary to Duke Johann Friedrich of Württemberg, was employed on diplomatic missions to France and England.\n\nBetween 1620 and 1624 he lived in England in the service of the Electorate of the Palatinate, and from this connection came to be employed in various positions in the English government. He was chief clerk to a succession of Secretaries of State and was especially skilled in foreign languages and cryptology. He acted as a licenser of London foreign news publications for Charles I and in the mid-1630s he assisted with the negotiations for the development of an offensive and defensive treaty with France that would have brought Britain directly into the Thirty Years' War. Although employed by the English crown, when civil war came in 1642, Weckherlin chose to remain in London and serve the bureaucracy that supported the Long Parliament. In 1644 he was appointed \"Secretary for Foreign Tongues\" in England, a position in which, on the establishment of the Commonwealth, he was followed by Milton. His son had a position in the household of Charles I's oldest son Prince Charles and went into exile with the royalists. He did not return to England until 1660 after the death of his father in 1653 in London.\n\nWeckherlin was the most distinguished of the circle of South German poets who prepared the way for the Renaissance movement associated in Germany with Martin Opitz. His models were the poets of the French Pleiade, and with his psalms, odes and sonnets he broke new ground for the German lyric. An epic poem on the death of Gustavus Adolphus, in alexandrines, seems to have won most favor with his contemporaries.\n\nTwo volumes of his \"Oden und Gesänge\" appeared in 1618 and 1619; his collected \"Geistliche und weltliche Gedichte\" in 1641. Weckherlin's \"Gedichte\" (\"Poems\") have been edited by Hermann Fischer for the \"Stuttgarter Literarischer Verein\" (vols. cxcix.-cc., 1894–1895). Selections were published by W. Müller (1823) and Karl Goedeke (1873).\n\nHis chief English poems were “Triumphal Shows Set Forth Lately at Stuttgart” (1616) and “Panegyricke to Lord Hay, Viscount of Doncaster” (1619).\n\n\n"}

He also contributed with 8 goals in 47 matches in the team's back-to-back national titles (1994–96).\n\nIn the following years, Ricken's success was hampered by a series of injuries. He gained his first cap for Germany on 10 September 1997, in a 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Armenia, but missed that major international tournament as well as UEFA Euro 2000. Later, he restored his form, helping Dortmund to claim the league title in 2002 by scoring a career-best six goals and being selected by national coach Rudi Völler for the squad at that year's World Cup; he did not play in the competition, however, as Germany emerged runners-up.\n\nRicken's injury woes returned after the World Cup and, as a consequence, he failed to earn recognition at both European or international level.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nMacabebe, an ancient town in the modern-day province of Pampanga, is intimately linked to the Pampanga River (Río Grande de la Pampanga). The town was named Macabebe because it is geographically situated along the shores (Pampangan: \"bebe\"; Tagalog: \"baybay\") or banks of Río Grande de Pampanga. The town is sometimes referred to as \"Makabibe\" because of the abundance of corals and shells along the Río Grande in earlier times. The Macabebes were the first Kapampangans to appear in European recorded history. In the Spanish Colonial period of the Philippines, Macabebe was considered one of the oldest and most important communities of Pampanga.\n\nThe ancient town of Macabebe owes its importance to its location along the Rio Grande de la Pampanga (Pampanga River). The river's routes and its northern tributaries provided the pathways to the early major settlements in Pampanga. The English translation of Macabebe, meaning: \" 'surrounded by rivers' \" describes the historical heritage of the ancient town.\n\nThe Macabebe dialect is said to be harsher and louder than others due to how the townspeople communicate across the river.\n\nThe Pampanga River is of great importance to Macabebe. Fishing is still a major source of sustenance and income for its residents. A number of fisheries can be found along the river.\n\nThe province of Pampanga is also the traditional homeland of the Kapampangan people. The Kapampangan of Macabebe had played a dynamic and at times conflicting role in the history of the Philippines. They fought against the Spanish in 1571, such as the case when the youthful Tarik Soliman (Bambalito) became the first Kapampangan and Filipino martyr who fought against Spanish rule. They also defended the last Spanish garrison against revolutionaries in 1898. The services of the Macabebes led to the naming of a street in Spain's capital city of Madrid in their honor, \"Calle de Voluntarios Macabebes.\"\n\nThe Capampangans of Macabebe as well, is the great ally of imperial Spain when the Dutch invaders tried to colonize the Philippines. They fought together with the Spaniards to protect the islands from its invaders, and in return only the Capampangan is allowed to study in prominent exclusive schools and universities ran by the Spaniards. \n\nIn 1901, American General Frederick Funston and his troops captured Philippine President Emilio Aguinaldo in Palanan, Isabela, with the help of some Kapampangans (later called the Macabebe Scouts after their home locale) who had joined the Americans' side. The Americans pretended to be captives of the Macabebes, who were dressed in Philippine Army uniforms. Once Funston and his \"captors\" entered Aguinaldo's camp, they immediately apprehended Aguinaldo and his men.\n\nDuring World War II, Japanese fighter and bomber planes air raided the municipalities of Macabebe in December 1941. Macabebe was subsequently occupied by the Japanese Imperial Army in 1942.\n\nMacabebe is located in the southern part of Pampanga. It is bordered to the north by the municipalities of Minalin, Guagua and Apalit; to the east by the municipalities of Calumpit and Hagonoy in Bulacan; to the west by the municipality of Sasmuan; and to the south by the municipality of Masantol and Manila Bay.\n\nMacabebe is politically subdivided into 26 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Macabebe, Pampanga, was people, with a density of .\n\nRoman Catholicism is the town inhabitants' main religion.

It was founded in 1575 under the advocation of San Nicolas de Tolentino. The heritage church measures long, wide and high. The facade of the church has scant ornamentation and its architectural symmetry is lost amid the various forms assumed windows, and the main entrance. Simple neo-classic lines of the facade.\n\nMacabebe is also home to San Gabriel Chapel. This newly erected chapel is a replacement of the old chapel that has been devastated by the flooding after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. It was then formally constructed in 2002 and came into completion and inaugurated in May 2010.\n\nAnother important church in the town is the Presentation of the Lord Parish in barangay Batasan. The chapel has been built over a century ago and was elevated to a parish church in 1995. Its first “cura parroco” was Father Gabriel Torres. \n\nOne of the most visited churches in Macabebe is the Sta Maria Chapel, the home of the barangay's Queen and Patroness (NUESTRA SENIORA DELA PAZ). The chapel is under the jurisdiction of San Rafael Archangel Parish Church. The newly erected chapel is a replacement of the old chapel because the old one has always been flooded during the rainy season. After the completion of its renovation, it was inaugurated in April 2005, and blessed by his Excellency Archbishop Paciano Aniceto, DD. The place where the church is erected was called \"baliti\". The name was attributed to the fact that prior to the arrival of the Spaniards in Macabebe, at that exact place, it was believed that a big balete tree was planted.\n\nLike other towns in the Philippines, Macabebe is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected for three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the town's departments in executing the ordinances and improving public services.

Prior to the LSE, he was professor at the Theseus International Management Institute.\n\nCiborra was an original thinker in his field: the Social Study of Information Systems. His contribution ranks among that of the top names in this and related fields such as Shoshana Zuboff, Wanda Orlikowski, Steve Barley, Lynn Markus, Lucas Introna, Jannis Kallinikos, Geoff Walsham, Rob Kling, Daniel Robey, Chrisanthi Avgerou and Richard Boland. He collaborated widely, including with such scholars as Ole Hanseth (University of Oslo) and Giovan Francesco Lanzara (University of Bologna).\n\nCiborra contributed to the following areas.\n\nCiborra goes beyond the typical characterisation of improvisation as situated, pragmatic and contingent action by referring to the existential condition of the actor (his “moods feelings, affectations and fundamental attunement with the situation”). By eschewing the notion of the actor as a “robot” adapting to changing circumstances he reintroduces the personal human aspects that shape our encounters with the world and shows how our affectations define the situation at hand and so shape action.\n\nAs expounded by Ciborra, bricolage can be seen as the constant re-ordering of people and resources, the constant \"trying out\" and experimentation that is the true hallmark of organisational change. But bricolage is not a random trying out: Ciborra emphasises that it is a trying out based on leveraging the world \"as defined by the situation\".\n\nHospitality is Claudio's attempt to present an alternative conception of how IT/IS is implemented. He rejects the scientific explanations of IS implementation (planning, design, goals, targets, methods, procedures) and instead views technology as an alien embodying and exemplifying its alien culture and affordances. Successful implementation is achieved when the \"host\" organisation (i.e. that implementing the technology) is able to extend courtesy and to absorb and appropriate/assimilate the alien culture where it offers advantages such as new ways of working. Claudio also warns that the host must beware that the guest can quickly become hostile.\n\nCiborra claims that much of the IS and IT world (particularly their strategic management, marketing, academia and training organisations) are in crisis. He teaches that this is because IS and IT are treated as scientific disciplines when in fact they are social disciplines and hence thinking about them is based in an inappropriate paradigm which we might call \"Positivism\" (although Ciborra does not use this term).\n\nCiborra drew on the work of Roberto Unger and showed how IS can embody and so be enacted as Formative Context.\n\nCiborra analyses Information System infrastructure using Heidegger's concept of Gestell.\n\nFor further information see \"Labyrinths of Information\", OUP, 2002.\n\n"}

In reality, Marvel purchased the line to prevent DC Comics from buying Malibu, in order to increase DC's market share.\n\nMarvel canceled the entire Ultraverse line, but (during the controversial \"Black September\" event) re-launched a handful of the more popular titles as well as a number of crossovers with Marvel characters. The initial move was foreseen with popular franchises and characters from the Avengers guest-starring in their books. The \"volume 2\" series each started with \"#∞\" (infinity) issues and were canceled a short time later. Within the Marvel Comics multiverse, the Malibu Universe is designated as Earth-93060.\n\nWhen Malibu was bought out by Marvel Comics, the entire Ultraverse line was cancelled and restarted. Only a few of the more popular series were rebooted and relaunched, with some being radically altered. The history and continuity of the Ultraverse was retconned in numerous ways, and a number of characters simply ceased to exist (or in the new continuity, to have ever existed). This now-modified Ultraverse lasted less than a year and a half before being cancelled once again.\n\nThe event connects issues that were part of the countdown to Black September — \"Ultraforce\" #8-10, \"Ultraforce/Avengers Prelude\", \"Avengers/Ultraforce\", \"Ultraforce/Avengers\" — after which all the surviving Ultraverse titles restarted with a special \"∞\"-numbered issue.\n\nIn June 2005, when asked by Newsarama whether Marvel had any plans to revive the Ultraverse, Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada replied:\n\nSenior Vice President of Publishing Tom Brevoort has stated in the past that the reason Marvel cannot discuss the Ultraverse properties is because of non disclosure agreements in place with certain parties, which has been speculated to pertain to Scott Mitchell Rosenberg's contractual position as \"ongoing producer deal for all Malibu Comics properties\".\n\n\n"}

His father was a merchant in the Indian trade. Stephenson joined the Royal Navy aged fourteen in 1892 when he began his training at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. As a midshipman he was posted to and . While with \"Forte\" he was involved in the Punitive Expedition of 1897 in Benin. Following promotion to sub-lieutenant on 15 June 1898, he went first to the First Destroyer Flotilla. In February 1900 he was posted to , flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet, and served on for the voyage to Malta. The following year he was given his first command, the torpedo boat, \"TB 90\". He was promoted lieutenant in June 1900.\n\nStephenson managed to make a favourable impression on Admiral Sir Jackie Fisher, the then Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean. As a result, Stephenson, aged just 23, was given command of the destroyer, . He then took the torpedo course at Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and was posted to the staff of , the Royal Navy's torpedo school. This was followed by appointments as torpedo officer aboard the cruisers and . After promotion to lieutenant commander, he served as First Lieutenant on the battleship . He was promoted commander in 1912.\n\nAt the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Stephenson was based in the Admiralty, attached to the Naval Intelligence Division. However, he soon managed to obtain a seagoing role as executive officer of . He was involved in operations in the Dardanelles, and then commanded a fleet of naval trawlers undertaking patrols from Crete. He went on to command the gunboat and, (as an acting captain) the Otranto Barrage, a fleet of small boats which attempted to control the exit from the Adriatic Sea, particularly trying to prevent submarines of the Austro-Hungarian Navy breaking out into the Mediterranean. In this last role, he also undertook early experiments into the use of hydrophones to detect submarines. He was Mentioned in Despatches in December 1918, appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1919 New Year Honours, awarded the Greek decoration of Commander of the Order of the Redeemer for his service in the Mediterranean and Adriatic, and was also awarded the United States Navy Distinguished Service Medal.\n\nThese experiments led to Stephenson's first post-war role, as director of the anti-submarine division of the Admiralty. He found many of his fellow officers conservative in their approach, and struggled to get new techniques accepted. He left this role in 1921 to command the cruiser , and then in 1923 the battleship , where he had the young Louis Mountbatten as one of his junior officers.\n\nStephenson then served ashore, first as Chief of Staff to the Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth and then as Commodore of Portsmouth Naval Barracks, where he undertook many innovations to raise morale including regular community singing. In 1929, he was part of the official British delegation at the funeral of Marshal Ferdinand Foch, acting as Naval Aide-de-camp to Prince George, and later that year was placed on the retired list, with promotion to rear admiral. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1930. From 1932 to 1935 he was Secretary of the Navy League, and he was promoted to vice admiral in 1934. He also ran a boys' club near his Hampshire home, where he was nicknamed \"Monkey Brand\" as the boys thought his heavily whiskered face was like the image used to advertise a well-known household cleaning product.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Stephenson was recalled as Commodore, Royal Navy Reserve. Initially he served as a Commodore of Convoy and made several trips in that capacity. He was also involved in the Dunkirk evacuation.\n\nIn 1940 Stephenson was tasked with setting up the training base at Tobermory on the Isle of Mull in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. This was to be the Royal Navy's Anti-Submarine Training School for the remainder of the war and Stephenson's greatest legacy was that his training methods had an influence within the service that lasted long after the cessation of conflict.\n\nStephenson realised that the task of training war-time reservist officers and hostilities-only ratings required a different approach to that of training regulars. He believed that the most important priority was making the trainees determined to win; then that they understood the importance of discipline; next the importance of correct administration; and finally technical proficiency—he felt that skill would be worthless if overall spirit were lacking. He emphasised strict discipline in his training combined with encouraging a willingness to adapt quickly to various situations with surprise inspections and orders to trainees as well as creative wargames to simulate difficult situations at sea.\n\nA frequently recounted anecdote is that when inspecting a corvette and its crew, Stephenson suddenly threw his hat on the deck and called it an unexploded bomb. A trainee (variously reported as quartermaster, or a sub-lieutenant) immediately kicked it into the water. After Stephenson commended him for quick action, but wanting his heavily gold-braided hat back, he then suddenly said the hat was now a man overboard and the trainee had to dive in to retrieve it.\n\nStephenson had the reputation of being a very hard taskmaster, with officers being replaced before the ship was allowed to leave (and even commanding officers being dismissed on occasion). However, he was reportedly very pleasant to those who matched his standards. Although he was disliked by the trainees, who called him \"The Terror of Tobermory\" and \"The Monkey\", Stephenson was credited in producing capable sailors who were able to meet the demands of the Battle of the Atlantic. As such, Stephenson is credited with being a factor in turning the tide in favour of the Allies in that critical contest in the war.\n\nA noted fictionalised depiction of Stephenson and his Second World War assignment is presented in Nicholas Monsarrat's novel \"The Cruel Sea\". Stephenson was reportedly very proud of this depiction.\n\nOver the four-and-a-half years Stephenson ran the school, 911 ships went through 1132 training courses at HMS \"Western Isles\". He was again Mentioned in Despatches in 1940, knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1943 Birthday Honours, and was later given the decoration of Commander with Star of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. He retired for the second time in 1945, with the anti-submarine battle won.\n\nThis second retirement saw Stephenson just as active as he had been previously. He was appointed Honorary Commodore of the Sea Cadet Corps in 1949, a post he held until the age of eighty in 1958, when he finally felt it necessary to step down.\n\nStephenson settled in Saffron Walden, and took a strong interest in local affairs, being known locally as \"The Admiral\". He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Essex in 1949, but resigned with 7 others in 1968. His name was listed as a sponsor of the National Fellowship in a full-page advertisement placed in \"The Times\" by the Fellowship in 1962.\n\nStephenson died in Saffron Walden on 27 May 1972, at the age of 94.\n\n"}

Bush from 2004–2007, and is currently a political pundit on TV. She previously served as Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Combating Terrorism. In 2008, Townsend joined CNN as a contributor, but later switched over to CBS where she is now a national security analyst for them. Townsend is president of the Counter Extremism Project.\n\nFrances Mary Fragos was born on December 28, 1961 in Mineola, New York, the daughter of John Fragos, a Greek American roofer, and Dorothy, an Irish American office manager for a construction company. Raised in Wantagh, Long Island, Townsend was the first in her family to finish high school. At the age of 11, she penned letters requesting that she be allowed to be an altar boy, first to her priest, then to the bishop, the Cardinal, and ultimately to the Vatican. After her requests were refused, her priest caught her trying to sneak into Mass with a borrowed robe. Her parents were determined that their only child should receive a college education, but could not afford to send her to school. Townsend saved money by accelerating her course load, waiting tables and working as a dormitory adviser.\n\nTownsend graduated \"cum laude\" from the American University in 1982, receiving a B.A. in Political Science and a B.S. in Psychology. She received her J.D. from the University of San Diego School of Law in 1984, and in 1986, attended the British Institute of International and Comparative Law in London, England.\n\nTownsend began her prosecutorial career in 1985, serving as an Assistant District Attorney in Brooklyn, New York. She gained the support and mentorship of federal prosecutors Rudolph Giuliani and Louis Freeh. In 1988, she was hired by Giuliani for the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York where she worked on white-collar crime. Townsend also ran the office's organized crime unit, where she conducted one-on-one interviews with members of the Gambino crime family.\n\nTownsend moved to the Justice Department in the early 1990s to work on international legal matters. In 1991, she worked in the Office of the Attorney General to assist in establishing the newly created Office of International Programs, the predecessor to the Executive Office for National Security. In December 1993, she joined the Criminal Division where she served as Chief of Staff to the Assistant Attorney General, where she took part in establishing the Division's international training and rule of law programs.\n\nDuring the Clinton administration, Townsend served in a series of positions at the Justice Department, eventually working as intelligence policy counsel for Attorney General Janet Reno. She served as Director of the Office of International Affairs in the Criminal Division from November 1995 until November 1997, when she was appointed Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General. Townsend was appointed Counsel for Intelligence Policy in March 1998, heading the office of Intelligence Policy and Review, whose various functions included approving intelligence-gathering activities related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Townsend managed the Justice Department's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review until 2001. She was one of Reno's key advisers, acting as a \"back channel\" between the attorney general and FBI Special Agent John P. O'Neill, who was also her friend. The incoming Bush administration did not opt to keep Townsend on. Instead, she served as Assistant Commandant for Intelligence for the United States Coast Guard. While she was on maternity leave during the September 11 attacks in 2001, Townsend assisted the Coast Guard in updating intelligence legislation to switch the branch's priority from drug smuggling to the vulnerability of U.S. ports.\n\nDespite concerns about Townsend's past as a Democratic appointee, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice hired her for the National Security Council in Spring 2003 at the urging of counterterrorism chief John A. Gordon and Homeland Security Advisor Richard A. Clarke. In December 2003, she coordinated government terrorism responses that led to the grounding of flights from Europe during the holiday season. She was appointed Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism on May 28, 2004. During her tenure, she oversaw an intelligence reorganization and conducted the first post-9/11 review of the White House's anti-terrorism campaign. Townsend served as the public face of the Bush administration while it was under criticism for allegedly overreacting to dated intelligence in its decision to raise terrorist threat levels during an election season. She also inspected Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison as an envoy of President Bush. Townsend was tapped to implement broad changes in the intelligence community recommended by a presidential commission headed by former Senator Chuck Robb and U.S. District Judge Laurence Silberman.\n\nTownsend then served in the United States Department of Justice, including a stint as Counsel to the Attorney General for Intelligence Policy in the George W. Bush administration. In May 2007, she was appointed \"National Continuity Coordinator\" under the auspices of National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 51.\n\nTownsend currently serves as an Advisory Board member for Protiviti Inc. a global consulting firm. She also sits on the Atlantic Council's Board of Directors. Other memberships include the Partnership for a Secure America, Council on Foreign Relations, and the Leadership Council for Concordia.\n\nIn November 2016, the UAE Ambassador to the United States al-Otaiba recommended through Tom Barrack that Townsend become President Donald Trump's Director of National Intelligence or Secretary of Homeland Security. In May 2017, Townsend was on the short list for the Director of the FBI following James Comey's firing.\n\nFrances Fragos married lawyer John Michael Townsend on October 8, 1994 in an Episcopal ceremony at Manhattan's Church of the Incarnation. As of 2006, they have two children, both sons. With a self-professed \"triple type-A\" personality, Townsend has been described as having a characteristic bluntness and a \"sometimes salty, streetwise style\" that once led her coworkers to nickname her \"The Hurricane\".\n\n"}

There he devoted his attention to physical and natural science, and in particular to mineralogy. Waltershausen was named after Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who was close friends with his parents. Waltershausen's father, Georg, was a writer, lecturer and professor of economics and history at Göttingen. Georg Sartorius (later Sartorius von Waltershausen) is best known in his role of translator and popularizer of Adam Smith's \"Wealth of Nations\". Waltershausen's son, August, was a well known economist who studied the American economy, and had at least one of his books translated into English.\n\nDuring a tour in 1834-1835 Waltershausen carried out a series of magnetic observations in various parts of Europe. He then gave his attention to an exhaustive investigation of the volcano of Mount Etna, in Sicily, and carried on the work with some interruptions until 1843 including with Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters. The chief result of this undertaking was his great \"Atlas des Ätna\" (1858–1861), in which he distinguished the lava streams formed during the later centuries.\n\nAfter his return from Mount Etna, Waltershausen visited Iceland, and subsequently published \"Physisch-geographische Skizze von Island\" (1847), \"Über die vulkanischen Gesteine in Sizilien und Island\" (1853), and \"Geologischer Atlas von Island\" (1853).

{"id": "2137053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2137053", "title": "Parable of the Ten Virgins", "text": "Parable of the Ten Virgins\n\nThe Parable of the Ten Virgins, also known as the Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins or the Parable of the ten bridesmaids, is one of the parables of Jesus. According to , ten virgins await a bridesgroom; five have brought enough oil for their lamps for the wait, while another five need to purchase more oil after the arrival is delayed. The five virgins who are prepared for the bridegroom's arrival are rewarded, while the five who are not prepared are disowned. The parable has a clear eschatological theme: be prepared for the Day of Judgement. It was one of the most popular parables in the Middle Ages and had influence on Gothic art, sculpture and the architecture of German and French cathedrals.\n\nIn the Parable of the Ten Virgins, Jesus tells a story about a party of virgins, perhaps bridesmaids or torchbearers for a procession, chosen to participate in a wedding. Each of the ten virgins is carrying a lamp or torch as they await the coming of the bridegroom, which they expect at some time during the night. Five of the virgins are wise and have brought oil for their lamps. Five are foolish and have only brought their lamps.\n\nAt midnight, all the virgins hear the call to come out to meet the bridegroom. Realising their lamps have gone out, the foolish virgins ask the wise ones for oil, but they refuse, saying that there will certainly not (Greek \"ou mē\") be enough for them to share. While the foolish virgins are away trying to get more oil, the bridegroom arrives. The wise virgins then accompany him to the celebration. The others arrive too late and are excluded.\n\nThe parable is one of a sequence of responses to a question in Matthew :\n\nOther parables in this sequence include the parable of the budding fig tree (Matthew 24:32–35) and the parable of the Faithful Servant (Matthew 24:42–51). The parable of the Ten Virgins reinforces the call for readiness in the face of the uncertain time of this second \"coming.\" It has been described as a \"watching parable.\" Like the parable of the Lost Coin, it is a parable about women which immediately follows, and makes the same point as, a preceding parable about men.\nIn this parable, Jesus Christ is the bridegroom, echoing the Old Testament image of God as the bridegroom in Jeremiah and similar passages, and the virgins are the Christians. The awaited event is the Second Coming of Christ. R. T. France writes that the parable is \"a warning addressed specifically to those inside the professing church who are not to assume that their future is unconditionally assured.\"\n\nThe parable does not criticise the virgins for sleeping, since both groups do that, but for being unprepared as they brought no oil (it is unclear as to whether the foolish virgins succeed in purchasing any oil that night: most shops would not have been open). The New Testament scholar, Dan O. Via, considers the story of the bridesmaids as an example of a tragic parable with an inverted U-shaped plot. The rising action of the parable is the preparation for the coming of the bridegroom, but a crisis occurs when the bridegroom is delayed. This is the turning point (reversal or peripety) that leads to disaster. A recognition scene (\"anagnorisis\") of the five foolish maidens occurs too late to reverse their fortunes (cf. Matthew 25:12). Yet the reader can benefit from their folly by considering the fatal flaw or \"hamartia\" that causes their downfall and by asking how their error in judgment can be avoided.\n\nThe parable is not written in praise of virginity, and indeed Louis of Granada, in his \"The Sinner's Guide\" of 1555, writes \"No one makes intercession with the Bridegroom for the five foolish virgins who, after despising the pleasures of the flesh and stifling in their hearts the fire of concupiscence, nay, after observing the great counsel of virginity, neglected the precept of humility and became inflated with pride on account of their virginity.\"\n\nSpencer W. Kimball gave an LDS perspective on the difference between the wise and the foolish virgins, and why they could not share the oil: \"This was not selfishness or unkindness. The kind of oil that is needed to illuminate the way and light up the darkness is not shareable. How can one share obedience to the principle of tithing; a mind at peace from righteous living; an accumulation of knowledge? How can one share faith or testimony? How can one share attitudes or chastity... Each must obtain that kind of oil for himself.\"\n\nThe parable occurs in all ancient New Testament manuscripts, with only slight variations in some words. Bible commentators and scholars do not entirely agree on the nature of the parable: whether it is an authentic parable of Jesus, based on an authentic parable but significantly modified, or entirely an invention of the early Church. According to Jan Lambrecht, \"a considerable number of exegetes in fact suppose that the parable of 'The Wise and Foolish Virgins' ultimately goes back to Jesus.\" Other scholars believe that this parable has only been lightly edited. \n\nThe argument for modification is due to the parable's eschatological nature, which seems to speak more directly to the situation of the early Church rather than the situation during Jesus's life (\"Sitz im Leben\"). A large majority of fellows on the Jesus Seminar, for example, designated the parable as merely similar to something Jesus might have said or simply inauthentic (\"grey\" or \"black\"). Bart Ehrman wrote that the parable makes sense within the context of the Church during the time period before the Gospel of Matthew was written, around 60–90 AD. Many early Christians believed the Second Coming of Jesus and the establishment of the Kingdom of God was imminent, yet this did not occur. In the parable, the bridegroom has been \"delayed\". The parable is thus an encouragement to keep watch and stay prepared for Christians who expected Jesus to have already returned.\n\nIn the Catholic Church, the parable is the Gospel reading for the 32nd Sunday in Ordinary Time in Cycle A; in the extraordinary form of the Roman rite (Tridentine Mass), the parable is the Gospel reading for Masses of virgins and virgin martyrs. The parable is the Gospel reading for the 27th Sunday after Trinity in the traditional Lutheran lectionary. In the Revised Common Lectionary, the parable is read in \"Proper 27 (32nd Sunday in Ordinary Time)\".\n\nIn the Armenian Orthodox Church the parable is the main theme of Holy Monday. A special Church service enacting the parable of the ten virgins is celebrated on Tuesday evening of the Holy Week.\n\nIn the Syriac Orthodox Church, the parable is used to commemorate the Sunday vespers service of Nahire. Nahire symbolizes our lives in accordance with the 10 virgins that only through a life of dedication, vigilance, fasting and prayer can we be ready for the Bridegroom himself.\n\nThis parable has been a popular subject for painting, sculpture, music, and drama.\nThe parable has been depicted in several paintings, including altarpieces in Northern Europe. A recent example, from 1954, is by Tove Jansson. In the 19th century, the artists of the Nazarene movement also took up this theme.\n\nSculptures of the wise and foolish virgins were a common motif in medieval ecclesial architecture in Europe, especially for the decoration of doorways, and carved figures representing them appear on many of the medieval churches and cathedrals of the Gothic style, including:\n\nThe virgins are also depicted on cathedrals in Switzerland and other countries; the portal leading into the main church of Hovhannavank (1216-1221) in Armenia has carved scenes from the Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins.\n\nThe ubiquity of such sculptures has inspired a fictional description: the carvings on the doors of Kingsbridge cathedral in Ken Follett's novel \"World Without End\", set in the Late Middle Ages.\n\nSeveral religious musical compositions have been inspired by the parable. Its message was formed into a hymn, \"Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme\", by Philipp Nicolai, which Johann Sebastian Bach used for his chorale cantata \"Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme\", BWV 140. The parable forms the theme for several hymns, including the 19th century hymn \"Behold the Bridegroom Cometh\" by George Frederick Root, which begins:\nOur lamps are trimmed and burning,<br>\nOur robes are white and clean;<br>\nWe’ve tarried for the Bridegroom,<br>\nOh, may we enter in?\nThe Wise Virgins is a one-act ballet, written in 1941 by William Walton, based on the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, with choreography by Frederick Ashton.\n\n\"Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning\" is a gospel blues song based on the parable. It has been recorded by such artists as Blind Willie Johnson, Reverend Pearly Brown, and Rev. \"Blind\" Gary Davis.\n\nNon-religious music has also used the parable as a theme, such as the ballet \"The wise and the foolish virgins\" by Swedish composer Kurt Atterberg (1887–1974), written in 1920.\n\nA reference is made to the parable in the 2002 Johnny Cash song \"The Man Comes Around,\" which draws heavily on the Bible.\n\nOn the 1974 album by Genesis - \"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\", a reference to the parable is made in the song \"The Carpet Crawlers\": \"and the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright.\"\n\nAmerican composer Emily Freeman-Brown has also composed an oratorio based on the parable. \n\nFrom early Christian times, the story of the ten virgins has been told as a mystery play. St Methodius wrote the \"Banquet of the Ten Virgins\", a mystery play in Greek. \"Sponsus\", a mid-11th-century play, was performed in both Latin and Occitan. The German play \"Ludus de decem virginibus\" was first performed on 4 May 1321. There was also a Dutch play of the late Middle Ages.\n\n"}

One of the brothers, Kynaston was also Lord Mayor of London.\n\nDuring his mayoralty was the re-opening of the transplanted London Bridge at Lake Havasu City, Arizona. The old bridge, which dated from 1831, had been sold by the City authorities for £1,025,000, and shipped to America to become the centrepiece of a new community.\n\nAs Alderman Sheriff of the City of London in 1967, Studd and his wife attended the laying of the foundation stone and in October 1970 he returned in full regalia to join the state governor in an opening ceremony which featured a Lord Mayor's procession.\n\nPeter Malden Studd was born 15 September 1916. Studd's father, Brigadier Malden Studd DSO MC, was ADC to King George VI during the early part of World War II.\n\nLike his forebear Sir Kynaston Studd, he was a governor of the Regent Street Poly (now part of the University of Westminster).\n\nBetween 1973-4 Studd was also a master of the Merchant Taylors' Company, thus maintaining another long-standing Studd family connection. An equally long-standing family connection was English Freemasonry, and Peter Studd was an active member of the organisation, and a Past Master of the Lodge of Assistance No 2773 (London, England).\n\nAmongst his other positions were:\n\nStudd was knighted in 1969 and advanced to GBE in 1971. He was appointed KCVO in 1979 in recognition of his work for the Prince's Trust, and became a Deputy Lieutenant for Wiltshire in 1983.\n\nIt was Studd's hope that he might be remembered for his work as leader of the campaign to save the structure of St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nThe roof and fabric of the building had suffered from the ravages of time and the constant vibration from the London traffic. During his mayoralty he was able to help raise £3 million towards the project and for him was a highlight of his year of office. His fundraising efforts were impressive and he was even able to persuade President Richard Nixon to be the project's patron in America. As a result, money flooded in, including one donation of $10 from an American pensioner who had visited the cathedral during the First World War in 1917.\n\nHer Majesty, Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother attended the celebrations at Mansion House which were held as a tribute to Sir Peter just before he left office.\n\n\n\n"}

It had some differences to the English-language version that Lawrence later wrote. Trenet's French version was a homage and ode to the changing moods of the sea, while Lawrence, by just adding one word \"Beyond\" to the title, gave him the start whereby he made the song into a love song.\n\n\"Beyond the Sea\" has been recorded by many artists, but Bobby Darin's version released in late 1959 is the best known by many, reaching No. 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, No. 15 on the US R&B Chart, and No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart. in early 1960.\n\nBefore Bobby Darin's, two recordings reached the Top 40 of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Benny Goodman's version charted in 1948, and was featured in the Cary Grant/Betsy Drake romantic comedy \"Every Girl Should Be Married\".

It is under the governance of its board and is under the monitor of the Secretary for Food and Health of the Hong Kong Government. Its chairman is Henry Fan.\n\nBefore the establishment of the authority, all health and medical issues were under the management of the Medical and Health Department. In 1990, a new health administration system was introduced as part of the 1989 reforms. The establishment of the Authority served to rebuild state capacity amid the emergence of party politics in Hong Kong. The department became the Department of Health and in 1991, the management of all the public hospitals was passed to a new statutory body, the Hospital Authority, which was established in 1990 under the Hospital Authority Ordinance. In 2003, the General Outpatient Clinics of Department of Health were transferred to the authority.\n\nHospital Authority has been providing services to the public under a cluster-based structure since 1993. It currently manages 42 public hospitals and institutions, 48 specialist outpatient clinics and 73 general outpatient clinics. These facilities are organised into seven hospital clusters according to their geographical locations, as shown in the table below. Each hospital cluster comprises a mix of acute and convalescent or rehabilitation hospitals to provide a full range of healthcare services.\n\nAccording to the Hospital Authority Ordinance (Cap 113), the Chief Executive of Hong Kong appoints members of the Hospital Authority Board governing the authority. The present board consists of 27 members, including the chairman. Membership of the authority comprises 23 non-public officers, three public officers and the chief executive of the authority. Apart from the chief executive of the authority, other members are not remunerated in their capacity as board members.\n\n\n\nTo perform its roles and exercise its powers, the board has established 11 functional committees:\n\nTo enhance community participation and governance of public hospitals, the authority has established 31 Hospital Governing Committees in 38 hospitals and institutions. These committees received regular management reports from the hospital chief executives, monitored operational and financial performance of the hospitals, participated in human resources and procurement functions, as well as hospital and community partnership activities.\n\nTo provide the authority with advice on the healthcare needs for specific regions of Hong Kong, the authority has established three Regional Advisory Committees. Each of the committees meets four times a year.\n\nThe authority is funded primarily by Hong Kong Government subvention, which amounted to HK$42.5 billion for 2012–2013, equating to over 90% of the authority's total income. Its other incomes include hospital and clinic fees and charges, donations, and investment.\n\nThe authority's total expenditure was HK$46.1 billion for 2012–2013, with 70% used to pay staff, and 14% to pay for drugs and other supplies.\n\nIn 2003, Hong Kong suffered from the outbreak of SARS and recorded considerable number of patients and casualties. The slow and delayed response of Hospital Authority was criticized. Believing that Hong Kong was safe from infectious diseases, the HA had inadequate preparation for facilities like isolated wards and single rooms that are important for the treatment of highly contagious diseases. In the early phase of the outbreak, public hospitals placed SARS patients in non-quarantined rooms that severely increased the chance of infection.\n\nOn the day when a Hong Kong girl was diagnosed as the territory's first victim of the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, anxious parents were frustrated to discover that doctors at the special unit set up at the Princess Margaret Hospital were taking the day off. Deputy Director of Health Gloria Tam said that it was \"not something so urgent that it needs to be dealt with in 24 hours... They can go during office hours tomorrow\". Medical sector legislator Leung Ka-lau said the lack of daily cover during the crisis was \"insensitive\". While the first victim left hospital after successful treatment one day later, two more children were admitted to hospital on 22 September; the Hospital Authority was reportedly overwhelmed when over 100 parents demanding check-ups for their children at Princess Margaret amids confusion about referrals and registration procedures, causing Secretary for Food and Health, York Chow to grovel for having underestimated the problem. Chow pledged 18 additional facilities around Hong Kong would be operational the next day.\n\nWaiting time for elective treatment is quite high. The average waiting time for cataract surgery in 2014 was 22 months.\n\n"}

He was Lord Deputy of Ireland in the last months of his life.\n\nWandesford was born on 24 September 1592 at Bishop Burton, near Beverley, Yorkshire, the son of Sir George Wandesford (1573–1612) of Kirklington, Yorkshire and his wife Catherine Hansby, daughter of Ralph Hansby of Gray's Inn.\n\nEducated at Clare College, Cambridge, and Gray's Inn, he entered Parliament as MP for Aldborough in 1621 and 1624. He was then returned for Richmond in 1625 and 1626 and Thirsk in 1628. His rise to importance was due primarily to his close friendship with Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards Earl of Strafford, who was his distant cousin. Although at first hostile to Charles I, as shown by the active part he took in the impeachment of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, Wandesford soon became a royalist partisan, and in 1633 he accompanied Wentworth to Ireland, where he became Master of the Rolls. Wandesford said that he went to Ireland not out of ambition, but simply out of his affection for Wentworth. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Kildare in the Irish Parliaments of 1634 and 1639 and was a member of the Privy Council of Ireland.\n\nWandesford's services to Wentworth were fully recognised by the latter, who wrote that of all the Privy Council he confided only in Wandesford and George Radcliffe, for whose services he could never be sufficiently thankful. In 1640 Wandesford succeeded Strafford as Lord Deputy of Ireland, but he had only just begun to struggle with the problems of his new position when he died, after a short illness which seems to have been a severe fever, on 3 December 1640. The medical treatment he received, which included applying split pigeons to the soles of his feet, is unlikely to have improved his chances of survival.\n\nHe had married Alice (1592–1659), the only daughter of Sir Hewett Osborne and his wife Joyce Fleetwood, and sister to Sir Edward Osborne, 1st Baronet, vice-president, under Wentworth, of the Council of the North. They had seven children, five of whom survived to adulthood. During the Irish Rebellion of 1641 his widow and children were forced to flee from their home and after some hardship returned safely to Yorkshire. In the general confusion Wandesford's will disappeared and was not found until 1653: this led to bitter family disputes and years of litigation.\n\nHis son Christopher (1628–1687), made a baronet in 1662, was the father of Sir Christopher Wandesford, who was created an Irish peer as Viscount Castlecomer in 1707, Castlecomer in Kilkenny having been acquired by his grandfather when in Ireland. Christopher, the 2nd viscount, was Secretary-at-War in 1717–1718. In 1758 John, 5th viscount, was created Earl Wandesford, but his titles became extinct when he died in January 1784. Wandesford's younger daughter Alice Thornton (1626–1707) is still remembered for her \"Autobiography\", first published in 1875, which is a valuable source for her father's life and career. Alice married William Thornton in 1651 and had three surviving children. Her elder sister Katherine (died 1645) married Sir Thomas Danby and had sixteen children, of whom ten survived infancy. There were two other surviving sons, John and George. George drowned accidentally near Richmond in 1651.\n\nDefence was a priority for Christopher Wandesford, who built a castle in Castlecomer sometime between 1635 and 1640. He had been granted Castlecomer after he argued that the O'Brennans or Brennans who had been there since 1200 held the area without legal right. Because of this he had to build a castle \"to protect his steward and collieries from the wild Irish\". Apparently he regretted this decision on his death bed and asked that half the rent for the entire area for the last 21 years be repaid to the O'Brennans. This was not done, despite the legal efforts of the clan. Finally in 1686 the Lord Chancellor of Ireland pronounced judgment in their favour, although it seems that this was not the end of the matter.\n\nThe Wandesford family were influential in Leinster, lending military aid to suppress the Irish rebellion of 1798 in Enniscorthy. A member of the family also married into the Butler family of Ormonde.\n\nStrafford's biographer, C. V. Wedgwood, describes Wandesford as shy, self-effacing, tolerant and charitable, a profound thinker, a fine lawyer and a man who was deeply concerned for social justice. Even though public opinion in Ireland had turned against Strafford's associates in his final months, Wandesford's death was genuinely mourned.\n\n\n \n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality is named after the santol trees that used to grow abundantly in the area.\n\nThe reason is either because there was a proliferation of santol trees in the area, or because the town was where santol fruits were heavily bartered (Kapampangans being fond of 'sinigang' dish).\n\nA legend of how the town got its name goes like this: 'A Spanish missionary came to the town for the first time. Upon reaching a roadside corner store, he parked his horse-driven vehicle and inquired from the store keeper the name of the place. A middle-aged woman vendor, believing that the Spanish priest was asking for the name of the fruits she was selling, readily responded in broken Spanish language, \"Padre, todos dulce Masantol.\" The priest took from his pocket a pencil and a small diary and wrote down the word \"mas santol,\" referring to the name of the place he has visited. At the time, the locality abounded with santol trees, and santol fruits were in season when the priest visited the place.'\n\nOriginally named San Miguel de Masantol and a part of the town of Macabebe, three of the town's leading patriarchs - Manuel Fajardo, Gregorio Bautista, and Juan Lacap - filed a motion on June 26, 1877, to separate the barrios of Bebe, Bulacus, Caingin and Nigui from Macabebe thereby creating a new Spanish pueblo called San Miguel. This new pueblo was approved by Spanish Governor General Domingo Moriones y Murillo and was inaugurated on May 1, 1878. On November 30, 1893, the Catholic Parish of San Miguel was formally acknowledged through a Royal Decree. For a while it came to be known San Miguel Masantol, until popular usage reverted it to the original name.\n\nOn July 26, 1904, Masantol once more became part of Macabebe. However, in 1907, Masantol was again reinstated as a separate independent municipality and this lasted up to the present.\n\nTarik Sulayman Bambalino / Bankau or for some Historians the Unnamed ruler of Macabebe was the indigenous leader of Macabebe from the \"Masantol area\", who refused to ally with the Spaniards and therefore mounted an attack against the Spanish forces of Miguel López de Legazpi during the Battle of Bangkusay Channel on June 3, 1571. The Joint Force of Macabebe, Calumpit, Hagonoy and Maynila \"Old Rajahnate of Maynila under Rajah Sulayman III / Rajah Mura/Muda of Manila\" were defeated, by the Joint Force of Spanish Armada and Tagalog mercenaries and Tarik Sulayman himself was killed in the Battle, and Consequently, this victory enabled the Spaniards to establish themselves throughout the city \"Territory of Kingdom of Tondo\" and its neighboring Kingdoms and towns.\n\nOn January 7, 2008, one person drowned, another missing and 40 others were injured due to electric shocks, when a live cable hit the floating pagoda boat in the fluvial festival of Virgen La Purisima Concepcion at Barangay Alauli.\n\nIn 2020, Masantol and the entire Province of Pampanga was placed under community quarantine starting March 15 to May 31 due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, or the NCovid-19.\n\nMasantol is almost surrounded by the municipality of Macabebe (For it was once a former part of the town). It is known to be the southernmost town in the province of Pampanga. It is bounded to the north by the municipality of Macabebe; to the east by the municipalities of Calumpit and Hagonoy in Bulacan; to the west by Macabebe; and to the south by some parts of Macabebe and Manila Bay.\n\nMasantol is politically subdivided into 26 barangays and 2 independent/dependent sitios.\nSitios:\n\nIn the , the population of Masantol, Pampanga, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe majority of the population are members of the Catholic church and each village or barangay has its own fiesta. The main Roman Catholic parish church of the town is the San Miguel Parish Church in Barangay San Nicolas, established in the late 20th century.\n\n\n\nMasantol is home to several primary, secondary, Vocational and Collage School among them are:\n\nBY NOW, Kapampangans should be totally convinced that the derogatory term dugong aso is not derogatory at all. Its original meaning was \"fierce and fearless\" (the British general William Draper wrote that Pampangos fought like mad dogs \"gnawing at our bayonets\") and \"loyal to a fault\" (the Spaniards called Kapampangans the \"loyal companions of our disgraces and our glories\").\n\nIt was only later when people started interpreting dugong aso as \"treacherous,\" which is totally the opposite of what dogs are.\n\nI will not make excuses for their acts; I will just say that when you are colonized, you are forced to make compromises to survive. We never lived in those times and therefore never know their sufferings and the moral dilemmas they faced every single day of their tortured lives.\n\nBesides, non-Kapampangans were just as traitorous. The Macabebe soldiers were only following orders. A Tagalog, Hilario Tal Placido, and an Ilocano, Cecilio Segismundo, defected on their own from Aguinaldo's camp and revealed his hiding place to the Americans.\n\nAll these thoughts about traitors and heroes come to mind. In life and in death, Andres Bonifacio was tormented by traitors-from fellow Katipuneros who abandoned, humiliated and executed him, to those who, after his death, disarranged, destroyed, and covered up evidence in an attempt to diminish his role in history.\n\nAt Tejeros where Katipuneros convened to choose between Aguinaldo who wasn't there and Bonifacio who was there, the electors who were mostly upper-class Caviteños chose the absentee as their new president. When they proceeded to vote for vice president, they ignored Bonifacio again and chose another Caviteño (Mariano Trias). And when they finally, reluctantly gave him the crumbs (the position of interior secretary), someone objected and had the gall to say that the Katipunan founder was not educated enough for the position. It was obvious the whole proceeding had been scripted from the start.\n\nWhen the split occurred, Aguinaldo ordered Bonifacio arrested. You'd think that with Bonifacio's stature the arresting party would politely salute him before putting on the handcuffs. Instead, they barged into his headquarters and mauled him and his two brothers Ciriaco and Procopio (some say they also raped his wife Gregoria de Jesus). The mauling was so extreme that Ciriaco died on the spot. Andres was stabbed in the neck before being hauled off.\n\nBonifacio had to be carried on a hammock to his trial, where he and Procopio were sentenced to die by execution. Aguinaldo tasked Bonifacio's former aide, Lazaro Macapagal, to carry out the execution, perhaps to further embitter Bonifacio.\n\nThey took the Bonifacio brothers to the mountain where they were killed-Procopio shot in the back and Andres hacked with a bolo. Were they left there to rot? Were they buried in unmarked shallow graves? Was it on Mount Buntis, Mount Tala or Mount Nagpatong? No one knows for sure. They destroyed all records about Bonifacio in an effort to promote someone else's role in history, according to HAU researcher Ian Alfonso.\n\nIn life, Bonifacio was shut out because he was poor, unschooled and an outsider in the circle of Caviteño elites who controlled a bloc in the Katipunan. In death, Bonifacio was sidelined because the American colonizers considered the elite, educated and pacifist Rizal as a worthier role-model for Filipinos, and also because Bonifacio's nemesis, Aguinaldo, lived long enough to perpetuate only his version of events (he died in 1964 at age 95).\n\nSome historians are saying that Bonifacio, not Aguinaldo, should be considered first President of the Philippines for heading the first revolutionary government before Aguinaldo's Tejeros convention replaced it. Others are suggesting that Bonifacio should be equally ranked with Rizal for launching Asia's first anti-colonial revolution that Rizal merely inspired and Aguinaldo merely continued.\n\nToday, a group of scholars, cultural workers and common folk are coming together in Barangay Sta. Cruz, Masantol, Pampanga to mark Bonifacio Day in a special way. They will use research and folk tradition to establish Andres Bonifacio's Kapampangan roots. The project is spearheaded by HAU faculty member and researcher Joel S. Regala.\n\nAccording to Regala, the Bonifacios originated in Masantol, not Tondo. His proofs? \n\n(1) A certain Domingo Bonifacio served as Macabebe capitan (mayor) in 1731. \n\n(2) More than a thousand voters surnamed Bonifacio are listed in Masantol and 256 more in Macabebe, compared to only 102 in all of Tondo. \n\n(3) There is an oral tradition among old folks in Masantol about Andres Bonifacio being their blood relative.\n\nRegala says he cannot find hard evidence about Andres Bonifacio's birth in 1863 in Masantol because all church records were destroyed in 1898 when Aguinaldo ordered the burning of Macabebe church after the Macabebes helped the Spaniards escape from his revolutionary army. Masantol was a barrio of Macabebe until 1878.\n\nRegala adds that Tondo is only an hour away from Masantol by boat. Then as now, Kapampangan merchants regularly went to Tondo to ply their trade. There were so many Kapampangan settlers there that they assigned a Pampanga Street.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the fact that Tondo formerly belonged to the linguistic orbit of the ancient Kapampangan Region.\n\nWhen Andres Bonifacio founded the Katipunan, he had Kapampangans with him, most notably Aurelio Tolentino. After Bonifacio's death, Aguinaldo also got help from Kapampangan generals (Maximino Hizon, Jose Alejandrino, Francisco Makabulos, Servillano Aquino).\n\nOther heroes had Kapampangan blood in them, too. Marcelo H. del Pilar was a cousin of the Hilarios of Bacolor (the H in his name stands for Hilario). Jose Rizal was related to the Mercados of Sasmuan (his father Francisco Mercado was descended from Domingo Lamco of Guagua).\n\nWith so many Kapampangan patriots and heroes, I don't understand why some people stay fixated on the few traitors.\n\nAs for the Macabebes, let me just say that even Aguinaldo himself asked to be photographed with them after his capture. Enough said\n\nThey must be referring to the Macabebes who helped the Americans capture Aguinaldo, and to two Macapagals in history: Juan Macapagal of Arayat who helped the Spaniards put down the Kapampangan Revolt of 1660, and Lazaro Macapagal who carried out the execution of Andres Bonifacio in 1897.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people. It was also formerly known as Nuevo México during the Spanish period.\n\nAccording to folk etymology, the original pre-Hispanic name of the village was purportedly \"Masicu\" or \"Maca-sicu\", which the Spaniards spelled as \"México\". It is claimed that this was a reference to an abundance of \"chico\" trees. However \"chico\" trees are not endemic to the Philippines and were introduced by the Spaniards. Another claim is that it is derived from \"siku\" (\"elbow\") and was a reference to the elbow-shaped bends of the nearby Abacan and Pampanga Rivers. But there are no records of the town ever being called \"Masicu\". Instead, the origin of the latter name is believed to be simply a common mispronunciation by the locals.\n\nAccording to the Augustinian records in \"Libros de Gobierno Eclesiástico\", the town was founded as a river trading port at around 1581 and was originally named Novo México (the Old Spanish form of Nuevo México, \"New Mexico\") after Mexico City.\n\nThe Spanish colonists made México the capital of the newly formed Province of Pampanga. Gaspar de San Agustin wrote that being the capital, México was one of the most “beautiful and charming” centers in the province. A lavish church made of stone and tiles, the Parish of Santa Monica, was built in 1581 with Masangsang and Matúlid serving as its \"visitas\". Mexico also formerly included the city of San Fernando, including parts of Angeles City (formerly the \"barrio\" San Angelo).\n\nIn 1660, Don Francisco Maniago, a native leader from México, led the Pampanga Revolt against the Spanish. It was caused by the imposition of forced labor (\"polo\") and rice tributes (\"bandala\") by the Spanish colonial government. Maniago also inspired similar revolts in neighboring cities. These were suppressed in 1661 by Governor-General Sabiniano Manrique de Lara.\n\nThe Spanish colonial authorities stripped México of its political importance after the Pampanga Revolt by moving the provincial capital further downstream to Bacolor. But it retained its strategic economic importance especially among the Lúsung Chinese and their mestizo descendants. México was still a regular drop off point of forest products from the upper reaches of the Ábacan River. It was also a favored destination by merchants from as far north as Pangasinan. By the 18th century, the Chinese traders and their mestizo de sangley descendants living in México, Guagua and Malabon had formed and maintained business and social alliances with each other. Cascos and sampans maintained the flow of goods along the Malabon-Guagua-México chain. Like the Chinese section of Manila, the commercial center of México became known as the Parián.\n\nIn 1898, General Maximino Hizon, rallied Kapampángans to fight the Spaniards under Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary banner and ordered the execution of the Parish priests of México and San Fernando. When the Americans replaced the Spaniards as the new colonists, General Maximino Hizon soon rose up to become supreme commander of all the Philippine Forces in Pampanga. He was captured by the Americans in 1901 and exiled to Guam after refusing to pledge his allegiance to the United States. He died in exile on September 1, 1901.\n\nMexico is administratively subdivided into 43 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Mexico, Pampanga, was people, with a density of .\n\nParish churches and Spanish-era chapels:\n\n\nIt has various educational institutions including:\n\n\n"}

Minalin is also known for its \"\"Aguman Sanduk\"\" New Year's Celebration, where in which the town's straight men dress up as beauty queens and ride through town on festive floats. The town is also referred to as the \"\"Egg Basket of Central Luzon\"\" because of its large-scale production of eggs and chickens, prompting the town to put up the Philippines' first egg festival in 2008.\n\nPansomun (grandson of Prince Balagtas, the ruler of the Kapampangan empire and Luzon), in his will, claimed to be a cousin of Rajah Soliman and Lakandula, the chieftains of Manila and Tondo in 1571 (conquest by Spain). Pansomun, as Christian convert Fernando Malang Balagtas signed in 1589 a will on the Kapampangan territory. Pansomun/Balagtas stated that he was born in Tabungao (Santa Maria, the old location of Minalin).\n\nThe legend of Minalin's name came from \"minalis la ding dutung, minalis ya ing pisamban\" (the lumber moved, and so must the church). Lumber stocks at Santa Maria for the church construction were carried by floods to a hilly Burol. Capitan Diego Tolentino wrote \"minalis\", thus, the name Minalin evolved.\n\nA Malayan settlement of Kahn Bulaun, Prince Balagtas' descendant, also found in the place, beautiful women. The Spaniards called the sitio, \"mina linda de las mujerers\" (a mine of beautiful women), which could also be the source of the town's name. Subsequently, Chinese traders abbreviated the words to \"Minalin\".\n\nMinalin's name might have originated also from \"minalis\" (\"to move to\"). \"Mina\" means mine, a word written on a rock left at the sitio in 1700 by a Spaniard José Espeleta, and \"Lin\", the founder's name.\n\n\"Gobernadorcillo\" (Mayor) Diego Tolentino wrote Minalin in lieu of Minalis and the Calendario Manual y Guia de Forasteros, 1839 to 1841, spelled Minalin, thus Minalin.\n\nIn 1860 Minalin was a producer of rice, corn, sugar cane, cacao, indigo (añil) and fruits, including dye, nipa wine, vinegar and mats (petates).\n\nMinalin is politically subdivided into 15 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Minalin, Pampanga, was people, with a density of .\n\nMinalin is one of the fastest growing economy in Pampanga despite its propensity to develop flooding.\n\nMerchandising, farming and fishing are the usual source of living of Minalenos.

Whether you are a known public figure, a farmer, or a professional, it is with utmost pride that a man from Minalin will dare step out of his status to give joy (pikatulan) to his people. With the continuous celebration of the festival, it is a living proof of how Minaleños value camaraderie (pamakiabe). It is the dare that keeps the community’s bond and strengthen the ties of Minaleños.\n\nThis annual display of beautiful dresses and expertise in women’s make up signifies that this town follows the dynamic changes in women’s fashion not only in the Philippines but also in Europe, Asia and in other countries.\n\nOn June 4, 2008, Minalin celebrated its fame for producing over a million chicken eggs per day by holding the country's first \"First Egg Festival.\" An exhibit of Minalin's egg produce was put up, and a taste test of 10,000 boiled eggs was held.

It was once among the largest municipalities in the archipelago before it was divided into separate municipalities.\n\nPorac was founded on October 31, 1594, upon acceptance by Fray Mateo Peralta in the Friar's Intermediate Chapter (recorded by Fray Gaspar de San Agustin, by saying Porac has its First Minister and Friar, Fray Mateo de Mendoza.\n\nThe General Headquarters and Military Camp Base of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary was stationed in Porac from 1942 to 1946 and the local military operates against the Imperial Japanese military and local collaborators from 1942 to 1945. The Mexican Expeditionary Air Force were given a base around Porac to help liberate the country from the Japanese Empire in World War II. (Marker: October 31, 2008, 412th Anniversary of Porac).\n\nPorac is west from the provincial capital San Fernando, south of Angeles City and north of Floridablanca. A portion of Mount Pinatubo is in the municipality.\n\nPorac has a hilly to mountainous terrain in the majority of its plains. Most rivers, if not all, are heavily silted by mudflow due to the eruption of Mount Pinatubo and succeeding lahar flows. Tourist spots include Darabulbul Falls (nicknamed Dara Falls) in Jalung, Miyamit Falls in Sapang Uwak, and the hot springs of Sitio Puning, accessed through Sapang Bato in Angeles City. Babo Pangulo offers a view of Porac and Mount Negron.\n\nPorac is politically subdivided into 29 barangays.\n\nThe town of Porac has two distinct climates, rainy and dry. The rainy or wet season normally begins in May and runs through October, while the rest of the year is the dry season. The warmest period of the year occurs between March and April, while the coolest period is from December through February.\n\nIn the , the population of Porac, Pampanga, was people, with a density of .\n\nPorac is an important source of granite and a tamping ground of minerals.\n\nPorac is home to the Mekeni Food Corporation, an \"AAA\" Meat Processing Plant accredited with the National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS). Being classified under the \"AAA\" category, it is qualified to market its products, not just in the local, but in the international market as well. This means that it is compliant to all government regulatory requirements to assure food quality and safety in its operations (Sun Star, 2006).\n\nIn 2014, Ayala Land and Leonio Land embarked on developing a mixed-used estate in Porac known as Alviera. The development project combines business, residential, recreational, leisure, and institutional. The local government dubbed Alviera as the regional growth center of Central Luzon. Now, it is a premiere tourist destination in the north.\n\nThe municipal government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judiciary. The judicial branch is administered solely by the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The executive branch is composed of the mayor and the barangay captains for the barangays. The legislative branch is composed of the Sangguniang Bayan (town assembly), Sangguniang Barangay (barangay council), and the Sangguniang Kabataan for the youth sector.\n\nSince the founding of the town of Porac in 1867, various Roman Catholic structures have been built in the area to aid in the religious practices of the devout Kapampangans. As of writing, three notable Spanish-era religious structures are extant within the municipality. The largest of the three, the Santa Catalina de Alejandria Church is located at Barangay Poblacion and still functions as one of Porac’s main parochial structures. The other two are currently utilized as barangay chapels.\n\nThe Santa Catalina de Alejandria parish church is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fernando. Its original structure, built in 1872, is largely intact but slight revisions have been made to the inside. It underwent restoration in the 1980s. The church is long, wide and high.\n\nThe 1861 Pio Chapel is a circular chapel built by Don Felino Gil, founder of the Escuela de Artes y Oficios (now the Don Honorio Ventura Technical State University).\n\nAnother vintage chapel is located at Barangay Dolores, north of the Porac town proper. The Our Lady of Sorrows Chapel was said to be built by the Dolores family within the old Hacienda Dolores in 1856. The chapel, like the Pio chapel, is currently utilized as a community chapel. The chapel boasts of a slender octagonal belfry and Doric columns adorning the two-level façade. Notable features of the chapel are finials found on both levels of the façade.\n\nThe area in and around Babo Balukbuk in Porac has strong indications of human habitation, according to investigations published on the University of the Philippines Archaeological Studies Program website. Later test excavations confirmed this conclusion through the presence of materials dated around 12th century to 17th century C.E.\n\n"}

In fact, today, a fishnet is permanently installed high above the altar precisely to catch thousands of bats that are roosting inside the church. The interior is dark, has an ambience of antiquity and mystery and overpowering odor of bat urine. The main attraction is the three-tower facade, perhaps one of its kind in the country.

The Sanguniang Bayan is the center of legislation.\n\nThe Local Government Unit LGU of Santa Rita, Pampanga's Elected officials for the term of 2016-2019 are:\n\n\n(San Basilio)\n\nSanta Rita is the home of Dúman and Ocampo-Lansang Delicacies (Turones de Casuy, Sansrival, Uraro and other sweets that sell in SM City Malls nationwide).\n\nDúman is made of malagkit rice (lacatan malútû) that is beaten from its husks and toasted in a clay oven. To the rest of the country, it may just be plain green rice or even un-popped pinipig. But it is a prized seasonal food that can be found during the Christmas season, after the rice harvest in November. The younger kernels of rice that don’t fall off the husks are colored green. These husks are beaten against a hard surface until they fall off. They are then soaked in water, cooked for 30 minutes and then pounded. This rigorous process helps release the sweet oils and nuttiness of the rice.\n\nFamilies who produce duman rice are called Mágdurúman. They pass their methods from generation to generation and have kept to the manual production process. Throughout Pampanga, street vendors selling green rice in bilaos or flat baskets are seen. These vendors often sell dúman near churches or marketplaces. It can be eaten plain and munched on like popcorn. It can also be snacked on in spoonfuls with sugar, or made into rice cakes. Kapampangans also like adding dúman to other dishes like fresh carabao’s milk or hot chocolate as a breakfast cereal, or even ice cream.\n\nSanta Rita is known as a producer of dúman. The region holds a yearly festival dedicated to this simple-looking treat. The festival started when the community found themselves gathered in the streets, pounding away the dúman with their large wood mortars at two o’clock in the morning. To the local folk, dúman can be bought at PhP 40 by the glass. However, it is also exported to other parts of the country and the world at around $35 a kilo.\n\nHarvested and processed through the end of December, dúman is usually eaten with fresh carabao milk (gátas damúlag) for breakfast or stirred into sucláti (drinking chocolate made with Philippine cacao). In Santa Rita, a Pampangan municipality and the epicenter of dúman production, the eagerly awaited specialty is honored annually with its own festival.\n\nYears ago, during dúman season, Santa Rita’s streets rang daily with the “tok-tok” of baseball bat-sized wooden pestles hitting meter-high mortars as lacatan malútû, a red-husked variety of glutinous rice, was transformed into dúman. Nowadays, only a few barangays engage in the laborious and time-consuming production process.\n\nThe Dúman Festival started in 2002, which originated from the long-standing tradition of pounding and winnowing unripe glutinous rice (lacatan). The festival features alfresco dining in front of the Santa Rita Church patio were rows and rows of delicacy stalls would sell various pastries and native dishes of the town with duman being the major highlight. The food sold during the festival would include native pastry attractions of the town like sansrival, masa podrido, mamón and mamón tostado.\n\nDúman is relatively expensive. Food critic Claude Tayag explains that unlike the regular rice variety, which can be planted and harvested three times a year, dúman can only be harvested in the cool air of November and December, otherwise it will not be a bountiful one. For every hectare (San Agustín and Santa Mónica), a farmer can produce only a maximum of 4.5 cavans of duman, while a maximum of 300 cavans can be harvested from the regular rice variety. Dúman prices range from P600 to P1,000 per kilo depending on the quality.\n\nThe heritage Church is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fernando.\n\nFr. Pedro de San Nicolas served as minister of both Porac and Santa Rita in 1722, but it was only in 1726 when Santa Rita had its own priest and therefore became an independent parish. Fr. Francisco Royo built the present church in 1839; Fr. Juan Merino completed it in 1868. These two priests also opened the road linking Santa Rita with Porac and Guagua. During the Revolution, the townspeople hid their last Augustianian parish priest, Fr. Celestino Garcia in their houses until the forces of Gen. Maximino Hizon captured him in Bacolor and took him all the way to Lepanto in the Cordilleras.\n\nBuilding of the church had to be delayed until the late 19th century due to economic adjuristicial conditions. The single-nave church is 55m long, 13m wide and 10m high. It has a large and well lit transept. The solid brass facade has baroque characteristics and the single columns are relatively slender.\n\nThere are five heritage bells in this town: the Señora de la Correa was installed at the belfry in 1869; Dolorosa bell in 1878; and the bells of Virgen de Lourdes, San Jose and Santa Rita—all installed on May 20, 1911. The last three pieces of relic bells were declared “Centenary Bells” by then-Archbishop Paciano Aniceto.\n\nThe installation of these bells was initiated by Fr. Braulio Pineda, the first Filipino priest of the town and a native of Santa Rita, before the 1898 Revolution against Spain broke out and after the cessation of the Filipino-American war in 1903, according to Msgr. Eugenio G. Reyes, J.C.D, P.A., Parish Priest from 2009-2014. Enrique Guanlao, then-president of the parish pastoral council, has indicated in a paper that the foundry of H. Súnico Jaboneros manufactured the five bells. By the time that Msgr. Reyes was appointed parish priest here in 2009, only the tandem of the medium-sized Dolorosa bell (campanang menor) and the huge Santa Rita bell (campanang mayul) gave the town a sense of time and ceremony.\n\nMsgr. Reyes learned that a steel hammer was used to strike the brass-made Santa Rita bell whenever it was rung, further damaging the bell. The wooden flanks holding up the bells and the wooden flooring of the belfry were crumbling. In 2010, Msgr. Reyes and Teresita Guanzon raised funds to repair the bells.\n\nIn August 3, 2010, Royal Bells Philippines (RBP) took them down for repairs. They were restored 47 days later and were blessed by then-Auxiliary Bishop Pablo Virgilio David (now Bishop of Kalookan). A note from RBP describes the Santa Rita bell as “the most beautiful sounding bell of its vintage and style that we have ever rehabilitated.” Msgr. Reyes says the pair of bells has been attached to an automated system. But the bells may still be rung manually, Msgr. Reyes says. Their last campanero (bell ringer), a man named Tátang César, is still alive. Guanlao says the bells are an important part of the lives of Santa Rita folk. The bells announced weddings, processions, feasts, floods, fire, deaths, the Angelus and the end of the 8 p.m. recitation of the rosary. In this small town of gentle people, the agunyas (agonías or the funeral sound made by the bell) for the dead is gender-specific. The Santa Rita bell announces the death of a man, while the Dolorosa does so for a woman.\n\nThe parish is the site where the Holy Relic of Saint Rita de Cascia is enshrined. The parish first obtained the First Class Relic of the saint through the help and assistance of His Excellency, Most Rev. Riccardo Fontana of Spoleto-Norcia, Italy, the archdiocese to which Cascia belongs. Archbishop Fontana forwarded the Relic through the mediation of the Apostolic Nunciature in Manila to Archbishop Paciano Aniceto who in turn handed it over to the parish of Santa Rita de Cascia on August 17, 2008. The First Class Relic is from the flesh “ex carne”of the Saint. As noted in its accompanying Certificate of Authenticity, the relic was part of the last batch extracted from the incorrupt body of Saint Rita on 20 August 1972.\n\nThe reliquary is laid open for public veneration every August 17. St. Rita of Cascia (1381) was born in the Italian town of Roccaporena. When her husband and twin sons died, she entered the Augustinian Nuns. The next 40 years of her life saw St. Rita devoting herself to a life of prayer, and works and deeds of charity as dictated by the rules of St Augustine. At age 60, while meditating before the cross, a wound seeming afflicted by a thorn appeared on her forehead. St. Rita began boring the sign of stigmatization which is considered being one with Jesus. Because of the stigmata, she suffered in pain for the next 15 years which she courageously accepted. St. Rita died on May 22, 1457. Her intact and incorrupt body is kept and honored in the shrine at her hometown on Cascia, Italy.\n\nThe Grand Old House of Santa Rita is the film site of \"Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang\", \"Tanging Yaman\" and many other films.\n\nThe villa was named after Dona Epifania who came from an equally rich and powerful Floridablanca-based clan, the Alvendias. The ancestral lot was owned by the Guanzon patriarch Don Agapito Guanzon (Captain Pitong) the then Captain Municipal (equivalent to today’s municipal mayor) of Santa Rita.\n\nCapitan Pitong’s son, Don Olympio Guanzon (former Pampanga Governor) would later inherit the lot and an earlier old house in the same lot by 1925. The old house would later be dismantled to give way for the villa and would later pass on to Don Felipe Guanzon. The villa was designed and constructed by Architect Mariano Pineda, a native of Santa Rita and relative of the Guanzons. Pineda would later join the Federal Architects of America.\n\nConstructed between the years 1931-1932, the house was one-of-a-kind at that time; it was the only all-concrete house in Santa Rita and the architectural design is incomparable with other historical landmarks in the town. The whole house is made of concrete with few exemptions, like the upper wall on the western side of the house facing the north.\n\nThis part showcases a gallery of windows as old as the house itself. The main walls of the house are concrete, about a foot thick on all the major sidings. The concrete materials were imported from Guiguinto in Bulacan. The villa’s wood portions are of the finest Philippine hardwood (narra, camagong and molave) and the furniture is of King Louis style. The furniture was acquired for the villa in 1931 and was bought from the Philippine Carnival in Manila and allegedly made by the prisoners of Bilibid prison. An azotea flanks the north side of the house which gives a perfect view of the western farm lands in Santa Rita, a major portion of which were once owned by the Guanzons and other notable lords from the Pineda, Lansang and Gosioco clans.\n\nThe doors of the former house that stood in the lot found their way into the second floor of the house. The doors and windows are made of colored glass with hues of green and orange. Wrought iron bars and grills protect the glass frames of the windows and the doors. A \"portico\" with granite staircase, will greet the visitor upon approaching the house and above it is a grand veranda accented with baroque pillars. Another small porch is located at the second floor near the grand veranda.\n\nThis porch though smaller is equally grand; the truth is there is no point in comparing the architectural designs from one another. An architect friend once said that the designs of the villa are “asymmetrical”, each with its own beauty and dominance in the house. No two sides are actually the same. The irregular symmetry unfolds into a united design, “baroque yet classical”.\n\nThe inside of the house is much the same design. However, a lot is still in store for an inquisitive visitor. The villa also offers other verandas at the second floor and a minor rooftop and chimneys for the kitchen. Not bad for a house made in 1932 at a hefty value of (reportedly) P90,000.\n\nIt was used as headquarters by the Japanese officers, USAFE guerillas and alcaldes during World War II and would late pass on as a relic of the past. But such beauty would not go unnoticed and soon enough it caught the eyes of location directors. The house was first featured in the Lino Brocka film “Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang” in 1976. Later in the 90s it was used as the backdrop for the movie “Tanging Yaman.”\n\nThe villa is located along Ocampo Street in San Jose, north of the town church and west of the municipal hall facing the east. The villa had served as a house that would later shape the political and social life of the town. From this villa came illustrious names in business and politics. The grandeur of this residence has done well to lift the bearings of this clan.\n\nAt present, the villa is unoccupied except by a caretaker (but the keys are held by the family of the late Epifania, the same owner of the Lourdes Church and Grotto at San Jose Del Monte City, Bulacan).\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt was known as Sexmoan until January 15, 1991. The town's former name in Spanish was Sexmoán, as was initially transcribed by Spanish friars. In Spanish, the letter <x> used to be pronounced as a voiceless postalveolar fricative /ʃ/, identical to the digraph <sh> in English. It was derived from the ancient Kapampangan rootword \"sasmo\", which means to meet, according to a 17th-century Kapampangan dictionary. \"Sasmuan\" therefore is synonymous with \"\"pitagmuan\"\" or \"meeting place of the datus\" or \"meeting point\". It was named \"Sasmuan\" because it is where the Pampangos meet when they were at war with the Chinese in Guagua. In 1991, it was unanimously changed into Sasmuan, since the previous name, Sexmoán, denoted a very negative sexual connotation not only to the town, but also to the people living within the town itself due to the inculture of believing that the prefix \"\"Sex-\"\" had something to do with the English word \"sex\".\n\nSasmuan already had a well-developed system of government well before the era of Spanish colonization. It evolved to be one of the oldest and major settlements in Pampanga by the 16th century. The Santa Lucia Church was one of the first Roman Catholic churches built in the Philippines by the Spaniards with the political and financial support of the Principalia.\n\nSasmuan is located in the southern part of Pampanga. It is one of the three towns in the province touching the Manila Bay (Others are Macabebe and Lubao). It is bounded to the north by the municipalities of Guagua and Minalin; to the east by the municipality of Macabebe; to the west by the municipality of Lubao; and to the south by Manila Bay.\n\nSasmuan is politically subdivided into 12 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Sasmuan, Pampanga, was people, with a density of .\n\nSasmuan has a unique geography in that it is surrounded by fish ponds. Aquaculture has been the main industry that drives the local economy. The fish from ponds and other areas are sold at the Fish Port.\n\nThe town has 2 prime business ventures and both are in the food industry. These two are Sasmuan Delicacies which was founded in 1990 and Aiza's Sweets which was started in 2000. For Sasmuan Delicacies, their products are being sold in many big supermarkets and malls in the Philippines, including SM City Malls. Aiza's Sweets on the other hand, has SM City Malls as one of their primary customer, but they also sell to several popular local shops such as Susie's Sweets, Nathaniels, etc. Also, Aiza's Sweets exports to the United States and Canada.\n\n\n\nThe Santa Lucia Parish Church in Sasmuan is the first church in the province built by Augustinian priests. It stands right beside the Río Grande, a river that connects Pampanga to Manila Bay. The structure is said to have been built by Jose Duque in the 17th century, was rebuilt in early 1800's, and was reinforced by Toribio Fanjul in 1884.\n\nThe edifice has decorative floral carvings on its main entrance. The old town church is one of the few, if not the only church in the country where the single belfry is situated between the church and the convento. The church, which measures long, wide, and high, also features a grotto of Our Lady of Fatima. Devotees from all over the province flock here to honor Saint Lucy, believed to be a miraculous saint.\n\nFounded in 1590, Santa Lucia is a parish of the Vicariate of St. Joseph in the Archdiocese of San Fernando. The parish celebrates the feast day of its titular patron on December 13.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nAs the youngest and smallest Pampanga town, Santo Tomas has a total land area of 1,467 hectares. It is a mainly agricultural and fishing community; industry includes casket manufacture, ceramics, and carpentry.\n\nThe town's name is derived from Baliwag (\"tardy\" in Spanish) a reference to local habit of arriving late for Mass. Baliwag, whose original name was Santo Tomas, had its Patron, St. Thomas the Apostle. He is also called \"Doubting Thomas\" or \"Didymus\" (meaning \"twin,\" as does \"Thomas\" in Aramaic) and was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. The Patronal Feast is celebrated yearly on the 21st of December from the town's original founding date of 1792.\n\nOn September 15, 1792, Santo Tomas was severed from its parent Minalin, Pampanga. On May 4, 1899, the town was under the U.S. Force's administration. On January 2, 1905, it was ceded to San Fernando, Pampanga until 1905. On October 12, 1951, Executive Order No. 476 (issued by Elpidio Quirino) created Santo Tomas and its five barrios of San Matias, San Vicente, San Bartolome, Santo Rosario and Santo Tomas with the seat of government at barrio San Vicente.\n\nOn January 11, 1952, the municipality of Santo Tomas was re-inaugurated. The first municipal hall was temporarily at the house of late Mayor Patricio Gomez, the first municipal mayor.\n\nIn 1955, RA 1250, the San Matias seat was transferred to Santo Tomas. Presidential Decree No. 1441 was issued by President Ferdinand E. Marcos on June 11, 1978, transferring the seat of municipal government from Barangay SantoTomas to Barangay San Vicente.\n\nThe town became the site of the bloody encounter between Filipino and American forces during Philippine Revolution known as the Battle of Santo Tomas.\n\nThe municipality of Santo Tomas, the smallest town in Pampanga, is at the heart of the province. The capital city of San Fernando bounds it on the north-west the municipality of San Simon on the north-east, the municipality of Minalin on the south-east and Bacolor on the west.\n\nSanto Tomas is politically subdivided into seven barangays:\n\nIn the , the population of Santo Tomas, Pampanga, was people, with a density of .\n\nIn the records of Department of Trade and Industry (Philippines), the town holds the title “casket capital of Central Luzon.” It is home to 300 family-owned casket businesses that each produce about 80 caskets monthly or a total production of 24,000 a month. Casket capital of the Philippines, Oct. 22, 2012\n\nSanto Tomas' main attractions and events are:\n\nPursuant to the local government the political seat of the municipality is at the Municipal Town Hall. The gobernadorcillo is the chief executive who holds office in the Presidencia. During the American rule (1898–1946), the elected mayor and local officials, including the appointed ones, hold office at the Municipal Town Hall. The legislative and executive departments perform their functions in the Sangguniang Bayan (Session Hall) and Municipal Trial Court, respectively, and are in the Town Hall.\n\nSanto Tomas' incumbent mayor is Johnny A. Sambo and the municipal vice mayor is Gloria P. Ronquillo.\n\nOn July 23, 2012, incumbent mayor Joselito Naguit filed his counter-affidavit to the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon on graft charges against him by former municipal administrator Rodelio Garcia. The mayor said over the weekend that \"the P9.5 million in cash advances he allegedly made for the months of May to November 2011 were all returned, accounted for to the last centavo and deposited in the municipal fund of Santo Tomas.\"\n\nOn March 2012, Mayor Naguit opened the LGU’s approved project under the Local Government Support Fund (LGSF) on February 29, 2011: \"P 700, 000 Improvement and Concreting of Balangcas Road.\"\n\nThe 1767 St. Thomas the Apostle Parish Church (Santo Tomas, Pampanga) belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fernando.

It provides public broadcasting and currently exists next to sister channels NPO 2 and NPO 3. A wide range of broadcasting organisations of the Publieke Omroep deliver programs. A wide variety of programs is broadcast on the channel, usually for larger audiences. In 2018, it was the most viewed channel in the Netherlands, reaching a market share of 22.0%.\n\nIn the Netherlands the first television experiments took place in the 1930s. Dutch technology company Philips played an important role in these experiments. In 1951 public radio broadcasters AVRO, KRO, VARA and NCRV established the NTS, Nederlandse Televisie Stichting (Dutch Television Foundation). The very first public broadcast began from studio Irene in Bussum on 2 October 1951 at 8:15 pm. It was transmitted from Lopik, soon followed by Hilversum as well. On 5 January 1956 the NTS broadcast their first news programme, \"NTS Journaal\". In the 1950s television attracted only a low number of viewers. The high prices of television sets were the main reason why. During the 1950s television became available nationally by the introduction of more transmitters and repeaters in Goes, Roosendaal, Loon op Zand, Mierlo, Roermond, Markelo, Ugchelen, Zwolle, Smilde and the new Gerbrandy Tower in IJsselstein.\n\nFrom October 1960 NTS began broadcasting daily from 8:00 pm till 10:20 pm. Two years later the broadcasting hours were extended from 26 to 30 hours a week. On 1 October 1964, a second public television channel began broadcasting, Nederland 2 and the first public broadcasting channel was renamed into Nederland 1. In 1967 Colour television broadcasts were introduced by using the PAL-system. Also in that same year advertising between programmes was introduced. In 1969 the Dutch government adopted the so-called open-system for the public broadcasting system, allowing more public broadcasting organisations. Though, a potential new organisation must have 100,000 members or more to be allowed in. On 29 May 1969, the NTS and the Dutch Radio Union (NRU) merged into the NOS serving as an umbrella organisation for the public broadcasting organisations. Its main focus is on general news and sports broadcasts and also provides technical and administrative coordination.\n\nIn anticipation of the launch of new commercial channels broadcast by satellite, a third television network, Nederland 3 launched in April 1988. After the launch of Nederland 3 in 1988, Nederland 1 was the mainstay of the broadcasters KRO, NCRV, VARA and EO. On 30 September 1991, Nederland 1 introduced a new logo which depicts a yellow \"1\"-numeral that is placed inside a blue diamond, and at the same time, VARA was moved to Nederland 2, while AVRO moved to this channel, thus earning the nickname AKN (AVRO-KRO-NCRV). Another restructuring was made on 28 September 1992 when Nederland 1 abolished in-vision continuity, in favour for voiceover continuity and at the same time, religious and humanism broadcasters moved from Nederland 3 to Nederland 1, where they were given more airtime for their output. In return, EO moved to Nederland 2, before making their programming output available on all three channels on 24 August 2000 before the huge revamp from 4 September 2006.\n\nLuxembourg-based RTL-Véronique began broadcasting in October 1989. In 1992, the government of the Netherlands legalised commercial television, and a number of new commercial channels were established resulting in a reduction in the market share of the public networks.\n\nUntil 2006 each public broadcasting organisation had been associated with just one channel, being either Nederland 1, Nederland 2 or Nederland 3. In the 2006/2007 season, the three channels got re-arranged. Nederland 1 became the flagship television channel aimed at a wide audience, Nederland 2 got a more highbrow programming with news, current affairs and documentaries and Nederland 3 is oriented towards children, youth and innovative television. The NOS is no longer the coordinating organisation. This function is taken over by the newly formed NPO.\n\nOn 16 September 2007, Nederland 1, Nederland 2 and Nederland 3 switched completely to anamorphic widescreen—before that time, only some of the programming was broadcast in widescreen. On 4 July 2009, all three channels began simulcasting in 1080i high-definition. Before the launch of the permanent HD service, a test version of the Nederland 1 HD channel was made available from 2 June 2008 until 24 August 2008 in order to broadcast Euro 2008, the 2008 Tour de France and the 2008 Summer Olympics in HD.\n\nOn 12 March 2013, the NPO announced that Nederland 1, 2 and 3 would be renamed as NPO 1, 2 and 3. The reason for this change is to make the channels and its programmes more recognizable. The rebranding completed on 19 August 2014.\n\nNPO 1 launched its first trials with ultra-high-definition television through KPN, CanalDigitaal and some minor networks on 14 June 2018, using the HLG-standard.\n\nKPN started to switch its digital terrestrial television platform to the DVB-T2 HEVC standard in October 2018, this transition completed on 9 July 2019. Since then NPO 1 is also available FTA in HD.\n\nCurrently, most of the biggest productions of Dutch public broadcasting television programs are shown on NPO 1, sometimes called the \"flagship\" of the NPO. Some notable programmes broadcast through the year are:\n\n\n"}

Renault wrote several historical novels in which Alexander appears: \"The Mask of Apollo\" (1966), \"Fire from Heaven\" (1969), \"The Persian Boy\" (1972) and \"Funeral Games\" (1981). She felt these were not enough to tell the whole story of Alexander, and so she completed her nonfiction biography.\n\nThe book makes no attempt to be impartial or neutral, but rather unabashedly advocates Alexander as a truly great man. For example, Renault rejects the usual terminology of the \"murder\" of Kleitos, pointing out that legally, \"murder\" refers only to a killing with premeditation, which absolutely was not the case when the King killed Kleitos in a drunken brawl, after much drink and much provocation. She also points out that the beauty of the mummy of Alexander was still much admired even many generations after his death. She refutes many slurs against Alexander, both ancient and modern. Renault also defends Alexander's friend Hephaistion, pointing out that he corresponded with Aristotle and was successful in every mission and independent command he undertook.\n\nThe hardcover edition is illustrated.\n\n\n"}

An initial 132-bit state is produced at the first stage using four inputs (the 128-bit key, the Bluetooth address on 48 bits and the 26-bit master counter). The output is then processed by a polynomial operation and the resulting key goes through the second stage, which generates the stream used for encoding. The key has a variable length, but is always a multiple of 2 (between 8 and 128 bits). 128 bit keys are generally used. These are stored into the second stage's shift registers. 200 pseudorandom bits are then produced by 200 clock ticks, and the last 128 bits are inserted into the shift registers. It is the stream generator's initial state.\n\nSeveral attacks and attempts at cryptanalysis of E0 and the Bluetooth protocol have been made, and a number of vulnerabilities have been found.\nIn 1999, Miia Hermelin and Kaisa Nyberg showed that E0 could be broken in 2 operations (instead of 2), if 2 bits of output are known. This type of attack was subsequently improved by Kishan Chand Gupta and Palash Sarkar. Scott Fluhrer, a Cisco Systems employee, found a theoretical attack with a 2 operations precalculation and a key search complexity of about 2 operations. He deduced that the maximal security of E0 is equivalent to that provided by 65-bit keys, and that longer keys do not improve security. Fluhrer's attack is an improvement upon earlier work by Golic, Bagini and Morgari, who devised a 2 operations attack on E0.\n\nIn 2000, the Finn Juha Vainio showed problems related to misuse of E0 and more generally, possible vulnerabilities in Bluetooth.\n\nIn 2004, Yi Lu and Serge Vaudenay published a statistical attack requiring the 24 first bits of 2 Bluetooth frames (a frame is 2745 bits long). The final complexity to retrieve the key is about 2 operations. The attack was improved to 2 operations for precomputation and 2 for the actual key search.\n\nIn 2005, Lu, Meier and Vaudenay published a cryptanalysis of E0 based on a conditional correlation attack. Their best result required the first 24 bits of 2 frames and 2 computations to recover the key. The authors assert that \"this is clearly the fastest and only practical known-plaintext attack on Bluetooth encryption compare with all existing attacks\".\n\n\n"}

It is mathematically identical to the more commonly used long multiplication algorithm, but it breaks the process into smaller steps, which some practitioners find easier to use.\n\nThe method had already arisen by medieval times, and has been used for centuries in many different cultures. It is still being taught in certain curricula today.\n\nA grid is drawn up, and each cell is split diagonally. The two multiplicands of the product to be calculated are written along the top and right side of the lattice, respectively, with one digit first column across the top fo first multiplicand (the number written left to right), and one digit per row down the right side for the second multiplicand (the number written top-down). Then each cell of the lattice is filled in with product of its column and row digit.\n\nAs an example, consider the multiplication of 58 with 213. After writing the multiplicands on the sides, consider each cell, beginning with the top left cell. In this case, the column digit is 5 and the row digit is 2. Write their product, 10, in the cell, with the digit 1 above the diagonal and the digit 0 below the diagonal (see picture for Step 1).\n\nIf the simple product lacks a digit in the tens place, simply fill in the tens place with a 0.\n\nAfter all the cells are filled in this manner, the digits in each diagonal are summed, working from the bottom right diagonal to the top left. Each diagonal sum is written where the diagonal ends. If the sum contains more than one digit, the value of the tens place is carried into the next diagonal (see Step 2).\n\nNumbers are filled to the left and to the bottom of the grid, and the answer is the numbers read off down (on the left) and across (on the bottom).\nThe lattice technique can also be used to multiply decimal fractions. For example, to multiply 5.8 by 2.13, the process is the same as to multiply 58 by 213 as described in the preceding section. To find the position of the decimal point in the final answer, one can draw a vertical line from the decimal point in 5.8, and a horizontal line from the decimal point in 2.13. The grid diagonal through the intersection of these two lines then determines the position of the decimal point in the result.\n\nLattice multiplication has been used historically in many different cultures. It is not known where it arose first, nor whether it developed independently within more than one region of the world. The earliest recorded use of lattice multiplication:\n\n\nThe mathematician and educator David Eugene Smith asserted that lattice multiplication was brought to Italy from the Middle East. This is reinforced by noting that the Arabic term for the method, \"shabakh\", has the same meaning as the Italian term for the method, \"gelosia\", namely, the metal grille or grating (lattice) for a window.\n\nIt is sometimes erroneously stated that lattice multiplication was described by Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī (Baghdad, c. 825) or by Fibonacci in his \"Liber Abaci\" (Italy, 1202, 1228). In fact, however, no use of lattice multiplication by either of these two authors has been found. In Chapter 3 of his \"Liber Abaci\", Fibonacci does describe a related technique of multiplication by what he termed \"quadrilatero in forma scacherii\" (“rectangle in the form of a chessboard”). In this technique, the square cells are not subdivided diagonally; only the lowest-order digit is written in each cell, while any higher-order digit must be remembered or recorded elsewhere and then \"carried\" to be added to the next cell. This is in contrast to lattice multiplication, a distinctive feature of which is that the each cell of the rectangle has its own correct place for the carry digit; this also implies that the cells can be filled in any order desired. Swetz compares and contrasts multiplication by \"gelosia\" (lattice), by \"scacherii\" (chessboard), and other tableau methods.\n\nOther notable historical uses of lattice multiplication include:\n\n\nDerivations of this method also appeared in the 16th century works \"Umdet-ul Hisab\" by Ottoman-Bosnian polymath Matrakçı Nasuh. Matrakçı Nasuh's triangular version of the multiplication technique is seen in the example showing 155 x 525 on the right, and explained in the example showing 236 x 175 on the left figure.\nThe same principle described by Matrakçı Nasuh underlay the later development of the calculating rods known as Napier's bones (Scotland, 1617) and Genaille–Lucas rulers (France, late 1800s).\n"}

He was also a personal secretary to Leon Trotsky from 1932 to 1939, and from then until 1947, an American Trotskyist activist.\n\nVan Heijenoort was born in Creil, France. His family's financial circumstances were difficult as his Dutch immigrant father died when van Heijenoort was two. He nevertheless acquired a powerful traditional French formal education, to which his French writings attest. (He also published in Spanish.) Although he eventually became a naturalized American citizen, he visited France twice a year from 1958 until his death, and remained very attached to his French extended family and friends.\n\nIn 1932, he joined the Trotskyist movement (recruited by Yvan Craipeau) and the Communist League. Very soon thereafter, the recently exiled Trotsky hired van Heijenoort as a secretary and bodyguard, primarily because of his fluency in French, Russian, German, and English. Thus began seven years in Trotsky's household, during which he served as an all-purpose translator, helping Trotsky write several books and keep up an extensive intellectual and political correspondence in several languages.\n\nIn 1939, van Heijenoort moved to New York City to be with his second wife, Beatrice \"Bunny\" Guyer, where he worked for the Socialist Workers Party (US) (SWP) and wrote a number of articles for the American Trotskyist press and other radical outlets. He was elected to the secretariat of the Fourth International in 1940 but resigned when Felix Morrow and Albert Goldman, with whom he had sided, were expelled from the SWP. Goldman subsequently went on to join the US Workers Party but Morrow joined no other party/grouping. In 1947, he too was expelled from the SWP. In 1948, he published an article, called \"A Century's Balance Sheet\" in which he criticized that part of Marxism which saw the \"proletariat\" as the revolutionary class. He continued to hold other parts of Marxism as true.\n\nVan Heijenoort was spared the ordeal of McCarthyism because everything he published in Trotskyist organs appeared under one or other of more than a dozen pen names. Moreover, Feferman (1993) states that van Heijenoort the logician was quite reticent about his Trotskyist youth, and did not discuss politics. Nevertheless, in the last decade of his life he contributed to the history of the Trotskyist movement by writing the monograph \"With Trotsky in Exile\" (1978), editing a volume of Trotsky's correspondence (1980), and advising and working with the archivists at the Houghton Library in Harvard University, which holds many of Trotsky's papers from his years in exile.\n\nAfter completing a Ph.D. in mathematics at New York University in 1949 under the supervision of J. J. Stoker, he taught mathematics there but evolved into a logician and philosopher of mathematics, in good part because of the influence of Georg Kreisel. He began teaching philosophy, first part-time at Columbia University, then full-time at Brandeis University, 1965-77. He spent much of his last decade at Stanford University, writing and editing eight books, including parts of the \"Collected Works\" of Kurt Gödel.\n\nThe \"Source Book\" (van Heijenoort 1967), his book on the history of logic and of the foundations of mathematics, is an anthology of translations. It begins with the first complete translation of Frege's 1879 \"Begriffsschrift\", which is followed by 45 historically important short pieces on mathematical logic and axiomatic set theory, originally published between 1889 and 1931. The anthology ends with Gödel's landmark paper on the incompletability of Peano arithmetic. For more information on the period covered by this anthology, see Grattan-Guinness (2000).\n\nNearly all the content of the \"Source Book\" was difficult to access in all but the best North American university libraries (e.g., even the Library of Congress did not acquire a copy of the \"Begriffsschrift\" until 1964), and all but four pieces had to be translated from one of six continental European languages. When possible, the author of the original text was asked to review the translation of his work, and suggest corrections and amendments. Each piece included editorial footnotes, all references were combined into one list, and many misprints, inconsistencies, and errors in the originals were corrected. Especially important are the remarkable introductions to each translation, most written by van Heijenoort himself. A few were written by Willard Quine and Burton Dreben.\n\nThe \"Source Book\" did much to advance the view that modern logic begins with, and builds on, the \"Begriffsschrift\". Grattan-Guinness (2000) argues that this perspective on the history of logic is mistaken, because Frege employed an idiosyncratic notation and was far less read than, say, Peano. Ironically, van Heijenoort (1967a) is often cited by those who prefer the alternative model theoretic stance on logic and mathematics. Much of the history of that stance, whose leading lights include George Boole, Charles Sanders Peirce, Ernst Schröder, Leopold Löwenheim, Thoralf Skolem, Alfred Tarski, and Jaakko Hintikka, is covered in Brady (2000). The \"Source Book\" underrated the algebraic logic of De Morgan, Boole, Peirce, and Schröder, but devoted more pages to Skolem than to anyone other than Frege, and included Löwenheim (1915), the founding paper on model theory.\n\nVan Heijenoort had children with two of his four wives. While living with Trotsky in Coyoacán, now a neighborhood of Mexico City, van Heijenoort's first wife left him after clashing with Trotsky's spouse. Van Heijenoort was also one of Frida Kahlo's lovers; in the film \"Frida\", he is played by Felipe Fulop. Having parted company with Trotsky in 1939 for personal reasons, van Heijenoort was innocent of all circumstances leading to Trotsky's 1940 murder. Van Heijenoort himself was also murdered, in Mexico City 46 years later, by his estranged fourth spouse whom he was visiting at the time. She then took her own life.\n\n\nBooks which Van Heijenoort edited alone or with others:\n\n\n"}

McLachlin found that there was no violation of the section. The Crown had conceded that the law adversely affected the child's security of person, so the issue was whether the violation offended a principle of fundamental justice. The Foundation proposes three claims as mentioned above. McLachlin rejected the first claim that it failed to give procedural protection as children receive all the same protection as anyone else. On the second claim, she rejects that the \"best interests of the child\" is a principle of fundamental justice as there is no \"consensus that it is vital or fundamental to our societal notion of justice.\"\n\nOn the third claim she rejects the claim that the law is vague and overbroad on grounds that the law \"delineates a risk zone for criminal sanction\". She examines the meaning of \"reasonable under the circumstances\" stating that it includes only \"minor corrective force of a transitory and trifling nature\", but it does not include \"corporal punishment of children under two or teenagers\", or \"degrading, inhuman or harmful conduct\" such as \"discipline by the use of objects\", \"blows or slaps to the head\" or acts of anger. The test is purely objective, McLachlin claims.\n\nSection 12 prevents \"cruel and unusual punishment\". Citing the standard of showing cruel and unusual punishment from \"R. v. Smith\" [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045 as \"so excessive as to outrage standards of decency\", McLachlin rejects the claim as the section only permits \"corrective force that is reasonable\" thus cannot be excessive by definition.\n\nSection 15(1) is the equality guarantee that protects individuals from discrimination. McLachlin examines the claim using the analytical framework from \"Law v. Canada\".\n\nWhen identifying from whose perspective the analysis must be, McLachlin notes that rather than take the perspective of a young child, which would prove too difficult, it must be viewed from the perspective of a \"reasonable person acting on behalf of a child\" and apprised of the law.\n\nMcLachlin says that the claim hinges on demonstrating the lack of \"correspondence between the distinction and the claimant's characteristics or circumstances\" (the second contextual factor from the \"Law v. Canada\" test). On this point she acknowledges that children need to be protected, and in furtherance of this goal parents and teachers require protection as well. Section 43 decriminalizes \"only minimal force of transient or trivial impact\" and to remove such protection would be dangerous as it would criminalize acts such as \"placing an unwilling child in a chair for a five-minute \"time-out\"\" which would risk destroying the family.\n\n\n"}

Stoneover, the manor house in which he grew up, today houses the administrative and faculty offices of the Oak Knoll School. Larned Road in Summit honors both father and son; Brayton School in Summit was named in honor of his younger brother Brayton, who died at age 15.

Although the common names in various languages refer to the species as a \"pine\", it does not belong in the genus \"Pinus\".\n\nThe genus \"Araucaria\" was part of terrestrial flora since the Triassic and found its apogee in Gondwana. Today, it is restricted to the Southern Hemisphere and has 19 species. \n\nCovering an original area of , it has now lost an estimated 97% of its habitat to logging, agriculture, and silviculture. It is native to southern Brazil (also found in high-altitude areas of southern Minas Gerais and in the east and south of São Paulo, but more typically in the states of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul). According to a study made by the Brazilian researcher Maack, the original area of occurrence represented 36.67% of the Paraná state (), 60.13% of the Santa Catarina state (), 21.6% of the São Paulo state () and 17.38% of the Rio Grande do Sul state (). It is also found in the northeast of Argentina (Misiones and Corrientes), locally in Paraguay (Alto Paraná), growing in low mountains at altitudes of and in northern regions of Uruguay where it was thought to be extinct until recent discoveries.\n\nThe prehistoric distribution of \"A. angustifolia\" in earlier geologic periods was very different to the present day, fossils were found in the Northeast Region, Brazil. The present day range is recent, the species moving into this area during the later Pleistocene and early Holocene. This chorological shift may possibly be due to climatic change and the migration of mountain flora by way of river courses.\n\nIt is an evergreen tree growing to tall and diameter at breast height. However, the largest individual, near Nova Petropolis, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil is 147.7 feet (45 meters) in height with a D.B.H. (diameter at breast height) of 12.5 feet (twelve meters girth). The leaves are thick, tough and scale like, triangular, long, broad at the base, and with razor-sharp edges and tip. They persist 10 to 15 years, so cover most of the tree except for the trunk and older branches. It is closely related to \"Araucaria araucana\" from further southwest in South America, differing most conspicuously in the narrower leaves.\n\nIt is usually dioecious, with the male and female cones on separate trees. The male (pollen) cones are oblong, long at first, expanding to long by broad at pollen release. Like all conifers it is wind pollinated. The female cones (seed), which mature in autumn about 18 months after pollination, are globose, large, in diameter, and hold about 100–150 seeds.

{"id": "2137292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2137292", "title": "Drag (physics)", "text": "Drag (physics)\n\nIn fluid dynamics, drag (sometimes called air resistance, a type of friction, or fluid resistance, another type of friction or fluid friction) is a force acting opposite to the relative motion of any object moving with respect to a surrounding fluid. This can exist between two fluid layers (or surfaces) or a fluid and a solid surface. Unlike other resistive forces, such as dry friction, which are nearly independent of velocity, drag forces depend on velocity.\nDrag force is proportional to the velocity for a laminar flow and the squared velocity for a turbulent flow. Even though the ultimate cause of a drag is viscous friction, the turbulent drag is independent of viscosity.\n\nDrag forces always decrease fluid velocity relative to the solid object in the fluid's path.\n\nExamples of drag include the component of the net aerodynamic or hydrodynamic force acting opposite to the direction of movement of a solid object such as cars, aircraft and boat hulls; or acting in the same geographical direction of motion as the solid, as for sails attached to a down wind sail boat, or in intermediate directions on a sail depending on points of sail. In the case of viscous drag of fluid in a pipe, drag force on the immobile pipe decreases fluid velocity relative to the pipe.\n\nIn the physics of sports, the drag force is necessary to explain the performance of runners, particularly of sprinters.\n\nTypes of drag are generally divided into the following categories:\nThe phrase \"parasitic drag\" is mainly used in aerodynamics, since for lifting wings, drag is generally small compared to lift. For flow around bluff bodies, form drag and skin friction drag dominate, and then the qualifier \"parasitic\" is meaningless.\nFurther, lift-induced drag is only relevant when wings or a lifting body are present, and is therefore usually discussed either in aviation or in the design of semi-planing or planing hulls. Wave drag occurs either when a solid object is moving through a gas at or near the speed of sound or when a solid object is moving along a fluid boundary, as in surface waves.\nDrag depends on the properties of the fluid and on the size, shape, and speed of the object. One way to express this is by means of the drag equation:\nwhere\nThe drag coefficient depends on the shape of the object and on the Reynolds number\n\nwhere \"formula_8\" is some characteristic diameter or linear dimension and formula_9 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (equal to the viscosity formula_10 divided by the density formula_11). At low formula_12, formula_6 is asymptotically proportional to formula_14, which means that the drag is linearly proportional to the speed. At high formula_12, formula_6 is more or less constant and drag will vary as the square of the speed. The graph to the right shows how formula_6 varies with formula_12 for the case of a sphere. Since the power needed to overcome the drag force is the product of the force times speed, the power needed to overcome drag will vary as the square of the speed at low Reynolds numbers and as the cube of the speed at high numbers.\n\nIt can be demonstrated that drag force can be expressed as a function of a dimensionless number, which is dimensionally identical to the Bejan number. Consequently, drag force and drag coefficient can be a function of Bejan number. In fact, from the expression of drag force it has been obtained:\n\nformula_19\n\nand consequently allows expressing the drag coefficient formula_6as a function of Bejan number and the ratio between wet area formula_21and front area formula_22:\n\nformula_23\n\nwhere formula_24is the Reynold Number related to fluid path length L.\n\nAs mentioned, the drag equation with a constant drag coefficient gives the force experienced by an object moving through a fluid at relatively large velocity (i.e. high Reynolds number, Re > ~1000). This is also called \"quadratic drag\". The equation is attributed to Lord Rayleigh, who originally used \"L\" in place of \"A\" (\"L\" being some length).\n\nThe reference area \"A\" is often orthographic projection of the object (frontal area)—on a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion—e.g. for objects with a simple shape, such as a sphere, this is the cross sectional area. Sometimes a body is a composite of different parts, each with a different reference areas, in which case a drag coefficient corresponding to each of those different areas must be determined.\n\nIn the case of a wing the reference areas are the same and the drag force is in the same ratio to the lift force as the ratio of drag coefficient to lift coefficient. Therefore, the reference for a wing is often the lifting area (\"wing area\") rather than the frontal area.\n\nFor an object with a smooth surface, and non-fixed separation points—like a sphere or circular cylinder—the drag coefficient may vary with Reynolds number \"R\", even up to very high values (\"R\" of the order 10).\nFor an object with well-defined fixed separation points, like a circular disk with its plane normal to the flow direction, the drag coefficient is constant for \"R\" > 3,500.\nFurther the drag coefficient \"C\" is, in general, a function of the orientation of the flow with respect to the object (apart from symmetrical objects like a sphere).\n\nUnder the assumption that the fluid is not moving relative to the currently used reference system, the power required to overcome the aerodynamic drag is given by:\n\nNote that the power needed to push an object through a fluid increases as the cube of the velocity. A car cruising on a highway at may require only to overcome aerodynamic drag, but that same car at requires . With a doubling of speed the drag (force) quadruples per the formula. Exerting 4 times the force over a fixed distance produces 4 times as much work. At twice the speed the work (resulting in displacement over a fixed distance) is done twice as fast. Since power is the rate of doing work, 4 times the work done in half the time requires 8 times the power.\n\nWhen the fluid is moving relative to the reference system (e.g. a car driving into headwind) the power required to overcome the aerodynamic drag is given by:\n\nWhere formula_28 is the wind speed and formula_29 is the object speed (both relative to ground).\n\nThe velocity as a function of time for an object falling through a non-dense medium, and released at zero relative-velocity \"v\" = 0 at time \"t\" = 0, is roughly given by a function involving a hyperbolic tangent (tanh):\n\nThe hyperbolic tangent has a limit value of one, for large time \"t\". In other words, velocity asymptotically approaches a maximum value called the terminal velocity \"v\":\n\nFor an object falling and released at relative-velocity \"v\" = v at time \"t\" = 0, with v ≤ v, is also defined in terms of the hyperbolic tangent function:\n\nActually, this function is defined by the solution of the following differential equation:\n\nOr, more generically (where F(v) are the forces acting on the object beyond drag):\n\nFor a potato-shaped object of average diameter \"d\" and of density \"ρ\", terminal velocity is about\n\nFor objects of water-like density (raindrops, hail, live objects—mammals, birds, insects, etc.) falling in air near Earth's surface at sea level, the terminal velocity is roughly equal to\n\nwith \"d\" in metre and \"v\" in m/s. For example, for a human body (formula_37 ~ 0.6 m) formula_38 ~ 70 m/s, for a small animal like a cat (formula_37 ~ 0.2 m) formula_38 ~ 40 m/s, for a small bird (formula_37 ~ 0.05 m) formula_38 ~ 20 m/s, for an insect (formula_37 ~ 0.01 m) formula_38 ~ 9 m/s, and so on. Terminal velocity for very small objects (pollen, etc.) at low Reynolds numbers is determined by Stokes law.\n\nTerminal velocity is higher for larger creatures, and thus potentially more deadly. A creature such as a mouse falling at its terminal velocity is much more likely to survive impact with the ground than a human falling at its terminal velocity. A small animal such as a cricket impacting at its terminal velocity will probably be unharmed. This, combined with the relative ratio of limb cross-sectional area vs. body mass (commonly referred to as the Square-cube law), explains why very small animals can fall from a large height and not be harmed.\n\nThe equation for viscous resistance or linear drag is appropriate for objects or particles moving through a fluid at relatively slow speeds where there is no turbulence (i.e. low Reynolds number, formula_45). Note that purely laminar flow only exists up to Re = 0.1 under this definition. In this case, the force of drag is approximately proportional to velocity. The equation for viscous resistance is:\n\nwhere:\n\nWhen an object falls from rest, its velocity will be\n\nwhich asymptotically approaches the terminal velocity formula_50. For a given formula_47, heavier objects fall more quickly.\n\nFor the special case of small spherical objects moving slowly through a viscous fluid (and thus at small Reynolds number), George Gabriel Stokes derived an expression for the drag constant:\n\nwhere:\n\nThe resulting expression for the drag is known as Stokes' drag:\n\nFor example, consider a small sphere with radius formula_53 = 0.5 micrometre (diameter = 1.0 µm) moving through water at a velocity formula_57 of 10 µm/s. Using 10 Pa·s as the dynamic viscosity of water in SI units,\nwe find a drag force of 0.09 pN. This is about the drag force that a bacterium experiences as it swims through water.\n\nIn aerodynamics, aerodynamic drag is the fluid drag force that acts on any moving solid body in the direction of the fluid freestream flow. From the body's perspective (near-field approach), the drag results from forces due to pressure distributions over the body surface, symbolized formula_58, and forces due to skin friction, which is a result of viscosity, denoted formula_59. Alternatively, calculated from the flowfield perspective (far-field approach), the drag force results from three natural phenomena: shock waves, vortex sheet, and viscosity.\n\nThe pressure distribution acting on a body's surface exerts normal forces on the body. Those forces can be summed and the component of that force that acts downstream represents the drag force, formula_58, due to pressure distribution acting on the body. The nature of these normal forces combines shock wave effects, vortex system generation effects, and wake viscous mechanisms.\n\nThe viscosity of the fluid has a major effect on drag. In the absence of viscosity, the pressure forces acting to retard the vehicle are canceled by a pressure force further aft that acts to push the vehicle forward; this is called pressure recovery and the result is that the drag is zero. That is to say, the work the body does on the airflow, is reversible and is recovered as there are no frictional effects to convert the flow energy into heat. Pressure recovery acts even in the case of viscous flow. Viscosity, however results in pressure drag and it is the dominant component of drag in the case of vehicles with regions of separated flow, in which the pressure recovery is fairly ineffective.\n\nThe friction drag force, which is a tangential force on the aircraft surface, depends substantially on boundary layer configuration and viscosity. The net friction drag, formula_61, is calculated as the downstream projection of the viscous forces evaluated over the body's surface.\n\nThe sum of friction drag and pressure (form) drag is called viscous drag. This drag component is due to viscosity. In a thermodynamic perspective, viscous effects represent irreversible phenomena and, therefore, they create entropy. The calculated viscous drag formula_62 use entropy changes to accurately predict the drag force.\n\nWhen the airplane produces lift, another drag component results. Induced drag, symbolized formula_63, is due to a modification of the pressure distribution due to the trailing vortex system that accompanies the lift production. An alternative perspective on lift and drag is gained from considering the change of momentum of the airflow. The wing intercepts the airflow and forces the flow to move downward. This results in an equal and opposite force acting upward on the wing which is the lift force. The change of momentum of the airflow downward results in a reduction of the rearward momentum of the flow which is the result of a force acting forward on the airflow and applied by the wing to the air flow; an equal but opposite force acts on the wing rearward which is the induced drag. Induced drag tends to be the most important component for airplanes during take-off or landing flight. Another drag component, namely wave drag, formula_64, results from shock waves in transonic and supersonic flight speeds. The shock waves induce changes in the boundary layer and pressure distribution over the body surface.\n\nThe idea that a moving body passing through air or another fluid encounters resistance had been known since the time of Aristotle. Louis Charles Breguet's paper of 1922 began efforts to reduce drag by streamlining. Breguet went on to put his ideas into practice by designing several record-breaking aircraft in the 1920s and 1930s. Ludwig Prandtl's boundary layer theory in the 1920s provided the impetus to minimise skin friction. A further major call for streamlining was made by Sir Melvill Jones who provided the theoretical concepts to demonstrate emphatically the importance of streamlining in aircraft design. \nIn 1929 his paper ‘The Streamline Airplane’ presented to the Royal Aeronautical Society was seminal. He proposed an ideal aircraft that would have minimal drag which led to the concepts of a 'clean' monoplane and retractable undercarriage. The aspect of Jones's paper that most shocked the designers of the time was his plot of the horse power required versus velocity, for an actual and an ideal plane. By looking at a data point for a given aircraft and extrapolating it horizontally to the ideal curve, the velocity gain for the same power can be seen. When Jones finished his presentation, a member of the audience described the results as being of the same level of importance as the Carnot cycle in thermodynamics.\n\nLift-induced drag (also called induced drag) is drag which occurs as the result of the creation of lift on a three-dimensional lifting body, such as the wing or fuselage of an airplane. Induced drag consists primarily of two components: drag due to the creation of trailing vortices (vortex drag); and the presence of additional viscous drag (lift-induced viscous drag) that is not present when lift is zero. The trailing vortices in the flow-field, present in the wake of a lifting body, derive from the turbulent mixing of air from above and below the body which flows in slightly different directions as a consequence of creation of lift.\n\nWith other parameters remaining the same, as the lift generated by a body increases, so does the lift-induced drag. This means that as the wing's angle of attack increases (up to a maximum called the stalling angle), the lift coefficient also increases, and so too does the lift-induced drag. At the onset of stall, lift is abruptly decreased, as is lift-induced drag, but viscous pressure drag, a component of parasite drag, increases due to the formation of turbulent unattached flow in the wake behind the body.\n\nParasitic drag is drag caused by moving a solid object through a fluid. Parasitic drag is made up of multiple components including viscous pressure drag (form drag), and drag due to surface roughness (skin friction drag). Additionally, the presence of multiple bodies in relative proximity may incur so called interference drag, which is sometimes described as a component of parasitic drag.\n\nIn aviation, induced drag tends to be greater at lower speeds because a high angle of attack is required to maintain lift, creating more drag. However, as speed increases the angle of attack can be reduced and the induced drag decreases. Parasitic drag, however, increases because the fluid is flowing more quickly around protruding objects increasing friction or drag. At even higher speeds (transonic), wave drag enters the picture. Each of these forms of drag changes in proportion to the others based on speed. The combined overall drag curve therefore shows a minimum at some airspeed - an aircraft flying at this speed will be at or close to its optimal efficiency. Pilots will use this speed to maximize endurance (minimum fuel consumption), or maximize gliding range in the event of an engine failure.\n\nThe interaction of parasitic and induced drag \"vs.\" airspeed can be plotted as a characteristic curve, illustrated here. In aviation, this is often referred to as the \"power curve\", and is important to pilots because it shows that, below a certain airspeed, maintaining airspeed counterintuitively requires \"more\" thrust as speed decreases, rather than less. The consequences of being \"behind the curve\" in flight are important and are taught as part of pilot training. At the subsonic airspeeds where the \"U\" shape of this curve is significant, wave drag has not yet become a factor, and so it is not shown in the curve.\n\nWave drag (also called compressibility drag) is drag that is created when a body moves in a compressible fluid and at speeds that are close to the speed of sound in that fluid. In aerodynamics, wave drag consists of multiple components depending on the speed regime of the flight.\n\nIn transonic flight (Mach numbers greater than about 0.8 and less than about 1.4), wave drag is the result of the formation of shockwaves in the fluid, formed when local areas of supersonic (Mach number greater than 1.0) flow are created. In practice, supersonic flow occurs on bodies traveling well below the speed of sound, as the local speed of air increases as it accelerates over the body to speeds above Mach 1.0. However, full supersonic flow over the vehicle will not develop until well past Mach 1.0. Aircraft flying at transonic speed often incur wave drag through the normal course of operation. In transonic flight, wave drag is commonly referred to as transonic compressibility drag. Transonic compressibility drag increases significantly as the speed of flight increases towards Mach 1.0, dominating other forms of drag at those speeds.\n\nIn supersonic flight (Mach numbers greater than 1.0), wave drag is the result of shockwaves present in the fluid and attached to the body, typically oblique shockwaves formed at the leading and trailing edges of the body. In highly supersonic flows, or in bodies with turning angles sufficiently large, unattached shockwaves, or bow waves will instead form. Additionally, local areas of transonic flow behind the initial shockwave may occur at lower supersonic speeds, and can lead to the development of additional, smaller shockwaves present on the surfaces of other lifting bodies, similar to those found in transonic flows. In supersonic flow regimes, wave drag is commonly separated into two components, supersonic lift-dependent wave drag and supersonic volume-dependent wave drag.\n\nThe closed form solution for the minimum wave drag of a body of revolution with a fixed length was found by Sears and Haack, and is known as the Sears-Haack Distribution. Similarly, for a fixed volume, the shape for minimum wave drag is the Von Karman Ogive.\n\nThe Busemann biplane is not, in principle, subject to wave drag when operated at its design speed, but is incapable of generating lift in this condition.\n\nIn 1752 d'Alembert proved that potential flow, the 18th century state-of-the-art inviscid flow theory amenable to mathematical solutions, resulted in the prediction of zero drag. This was in contradiction with experimental evidence, and became known as d'Alembert's paradox. In the 19th century the Navier–Stokes equations for the description of viscous flow were developed by Saint-Venant, Navier and Stokes. Stokes derived the drag around a sphere at very low Reynolds numbers, the result of which is called Stokes' law.\n\nIn the limit of high Reynolds numbers, the Navier–Stokes equations approach the inviscid Euler equations, of which the potential-flow solutions considered by d'Alembert are solutions. However, all experiments at high Reynolds numbers showed there is drag. Attempts to construct inviscid steady flow solutions to the Euler equations, other than the potential flow solutions, did not result in realistic results.\n\nThe notion of boundary layers—introduced by Prandtl in 1904, founded on both theory and experiments—explained the causes of drag at high Reynolds numbers. The boundary layer is the thin layer of fluid close to the object's boundary, where viscous effects remain important even when the viscosity is very small (or equivalently the Reynolds number is very large).\n\n\n\n"}

The modern village of Böttstein is first mentioned in 1087 as \"Botistein\". During the 11th to 13th Centuries it was the seat of the lords of Böttstein, who ruled over the village. The other, neighboring villages were under the lower court of the Knights Hospitaller order house at Leuggern. After the conquest of the Aargau in 1415, the \"Herrschaft\" was held by the district of Leuggern in the County of Baden. The ownership of the administrative rights of the village wend through about ten changes until 1606 when it was bought by the von Roll family of Uri. Between 1615-17, they replaced the original castle with a late-Gothic - early Baroque mansion with chapel. Through marriage, the property came in 1674 to the Schmid family of Bellikon, who ruled over the village until 1798 and occupied the castle until 1893. The chapel of St. Anthony was given a wide range of ornamentation in the manner of Italian baroque churches with excellent stucco work, all done by northern Italian masters. In 1816 the municipality was formed by dividing the large municipality of Leuggern.\n\nBöttstein and the other villages were part of the parish of Leuggern.\n\nUntil the late 19th Century the major economic activities were farming, viticulture and handicrafts. During the late 19th Century, the timber industry grew along the Aare river, which provided many new jobs. The new jobs along the river allowed the small village of Kleindöttingen to expand rapidly.

The attack was published in 1999 by David Wagner, who used it to break the COCONUT98 cipher.\n\nThe boomerang attack has allowed new avenues of attack for many ciphers previously deemed safe from differential cryptanalysis.\n\nRefinements on the boomerang attack have been published: the amplified boomerang attack, then the rectangle attack.\n\nThe boomerang attack is based on differential cryptanalysis. In differential cryptanalysis, an attacker exploits how differences in the input to a cipher (the plaintext) can affect the resultant difference at the output (the ciphertext). A high-probability \"differential\" (that is, an input difference that will produce a likely output difference) is needed that covers all, or nearly all, of the cipher. The boomerang attack allows differentials to be used which cover only part of the cipher.\n\nThe attack attempts to generate a so-called \"quartet\" structure at a point halfway through the cipher. For this purpose, say that the encryption action, \"E\", of the cipher can be split into two consecutive stages, \"E\" and \"E\", so that \"E(M)\" = \"E\"(\"E\"(M)), where \"M\" is some plaintext message. Suppose we have two differentials for the two stages; say,\nfor \"E\", and\n\nThe basic attack proceeds as follows:\n\nOne attack on KASUMI, a block cipher used in 3GPP, is a related-key rectangle attack which breaks the full eight rounds of the cipher faster than exhaustive search (Biham et al., 2005). The attack requires 2 chosen plaintexts, each of which has been encrypted under one of four related keys, and has a time complexity equivalent to 2 KASUMI encryptions.\n\n\n"}

The branding is used for reprints of popular, top-selling games for each console in the PlayStation family, which are deliberately sold with a lower MSRP than the original production runs of a game, and feature special branding—colored in red since PlayStation 2—on their box art, as well as red-colored cases on PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 releases (instead of the traditional clear or blue-colored casing).\n\nEquivalent programs exist in Europe and Oceania (as \"Essentials\"), Japan and select Asian countries (as \"The Best\"), South Korea (as \"BigHit\"), and in South America (as \"Favoritos\"). PlayStation Hits is used as the branding label for PlayStation 4 games in North America, Europe, Oceania, Japan, and select Asian countries.\n\nWhen Sony introduced the program for PlayStation in March 1997, games could become Greatest Hits titles after selling at least 150,000 copies and being on the market for at least a year. Minimum sales required eventually rose to 250,000. When the program came to PlayStation 2 in 2002, games could become Greatest Hits titles after selling at least 400,000 copies and being on the market for at least one year. Suggested retail prices of Greatest Hits titles were initially $24.99, but they now typically retail for $19.99. Though Sony-developed games are virtually guaranteed to eventually become Greatest Hits titles by meeting their sales and age requirements, 3rd party developers are not required to release their titles with a Greatest Hits label even if said titles meet the criteria. Additionally, Sony allows 3rd party developers some flexibility in the pricing of their own Greatest Hits titles, but most of them stick to the agreed-upon suggested retail price. Games that are multi-million sellers may become Greatest Hits titles much later than 9 months to maximize profits. It is also a common practice for a game to re-release on the Greatest Hits label at a close proximity to the release of that game's sequel or follow-up.\n\nIn 2006, Sony extended the Greatest Hits program to the PlayStation Portable. To qualify, a title must be on the market for at least 9 months and have sold 250,000 copies or more. The Greatest Hits price for PlayStation Portable games typically begins at $19.99.\n\nOn July 28, 2008, the program was introduced on the PlayStation 3. A PlayStation 3 game must be on the market for 10 months and sell at least 500,000 copies to meet the Greatest Hits criteria. PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits titles currently sell at $29.99.\n\nSony announced the launch of Greatest Hits on PlayStation 4 in Mexico, Canada, and the United States, renamed PlayStation Hits, on June 19, 2018. As with PS3 Greatest Hits releases, they will feature red-colored packaging and a red banner on their box art. PlayStation Hits pricing will also be available on PlayStation Store.\n\nWhile Greatest Hits titles are usually just a re-release of the original game with altered packaging and a lower price, occasionally a game is given a \"special edition\" of its original version, released under the Greatest Hits label. Usually these additions are small bonuses, such as the inclusion of bugfixes, new game demos or soundtrack CDs, or slight improvements such as adding analog control or vibration functionality to games that did not have these features in their original releases. Occasionally, significant changes are implemented into the game. Noteworthy examples of this are the Greatest Hits special editions of \"\", \"\", \"Heavy Rain\", \"Jet Moto 2\", \"\", \"\", \"Midnight Club Los Angeles\", \"Silent Hill 2\", \"\", and \"\", which were enhanced significantly from their original releases with added characters, levels, modes, features, etc.\n\nThe following titles have been released on the Greatest Hits label for PlayStation.\n\nThe following titles have been released on the Greatest Hits label for PlayStation 2.\n\nThe following titles have been released on the Greatest Hits label for PlayStation 3.\n\n\nThe following titles have been released on the Greatest Hits label for PlayStation Portable.\n\nThe following list shows only PlayStation Hits titles for North America.

{"id": "2137340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2137340", "title": "Watcher (comics)", "text": "Watcher (comics)\n\nThe Watchers are a race of fictional extraterrestrials appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics whose purpose is to watch over the multiverses of the series. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the first Watcher to appear in the comics—named Uatu—appears in \"Fantastic Four\" #13 (April 1963).\n\nThe Watchers appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" (2017). \n\nThe Watchers are one of the oldest species in the universe and are committed to observing and compiling knowledge on all aspects of the universe. This policy of total non-interference came into existence due to a former, well-meant attempt by the Watchers to bestow advanced knowledge on the Prosilicans, who used the nuclear technology gained to create weapons and destroy themselves. When the Watchers returned to Prosilicus, the survivors blamed them for causing the catastrophe by giving the Prosilicans nuclear technology before they were ready for it. The Watchers then took a vow never to interfere with other civilizations.\n\nDespite this, the Watcher Uatu has revealed himself to the superhero team the Fantastic Four, telling them of his race. In his first appearance, he made them battle the Red Ghost and his Super-Apes for control of the Moon. He complimented Reed Richards and claimed he would go to a more distant part of the galaxy to observe humanity. He aids them on several occasions against global threats such as the Molecule Man, Galactus, and the Overmind. The Leader discovered his existence and tracked him to his world. He transported the Hulk there to get the Ultimate Machine, which contains all the information in the Universe. The Hulk battled the Amphibious Qnax, who had also been sent to recover the machine. The Watcher transported them away from his machines to battle, and when the Hulk won, he transported Qnax back to his homeworld. He then took the Hulk back to his base, where the Hulk took the Machine despite the Watcher's warnings. The Leader transported him back to Earth and tried to use the device. However, the tremendous amount of knowledge proved too much for the Leader. He collapsed to the ground, unmoving, and the Hulk assumed that he died of shock. When the Hulk tried to use the machine himself, Uatu allowed him to hear the voice of Rick Jones, after which the Hulk removed the device. The Watcher then transported the Ultimate Machine back to his planet. After blatant interference with the mission of the Kree soldier Mar-Vell, Uatu is put on trial by his own race, but is released on the provision that he never directly interfere again.\n\nUatu is later banished by his race for aiding the Fantastic Four against the threat of his rogue nephew, Aron, the Renegade Watcher, who tries to destroy the universe. The Dreaming Celestial later scans Uatu and learns the Watcher has broken his pact of non-interference almost 400 times. The Celestial also reveals the Watchers, like the Celestials themselves, are servants of a concept called Fulcrum, with apparent consequences for interference. Despite this, the other Watchers have interfered in other civilizations' events, though rarely, notably when the world-ending robot Omegex approached the Milky Way and they deemed it dangerous enough to act directly against it.\n\nThere is also a tongue-in-cheek, splintered-off faction of Watchers that call themselves The Critics, who not only observe events, but also give dramatic critique as they take place. The only known Critic looks similar to other Watchers, but wears a mustache, goatee, dark sunglasses, and, rather than toga, dresses in a tweed sport coat.\n\nWhen Nova briefly visits Uatu and witnesses him watching various alternate realities, he learns that Uatu's father was the Watcher who originally gave nuclear technology to the Prosilicans, with Uatu's search of parallel universes being motivated by the desire to find the one world where his father's act of charity was proved to be the right thing to do.\n\nThe Watchers are cosmic beings, who possess the innate ability to achieve virtually any effect desired, including augmenting personal attributes, time and space manipulation, molecular manipulation, energy projection, and a range of mental powers. They also have access to highly advanced technology.\n\n\nThe Watcher Uatu often observes how key events from the Earth-616 Marvel Universe differed in alternate universes and speculates on the related consequences.\n\nThe Watcher appears as the host of Marvel Comics spoof. On the first page, he appears as a peeping-tom.\n\nIn the alternate reality of Earth X (Earth-9997), the Watchers are slaves of the Celestials. As punishment for their non-interference during the birth of their arch-enemy Galactus, the Celestials force the Watchers to observe the impregnation of newly formed planets with their Celestial eggs, and the eventual birth of the Celestial within, which ultimately destroys that planet.\n\nIn the Ultimate Marvel alternate universe limited series \"Ultimate Origins\", the Watchers are depicted as machines that speak through a human host (Sue Storm). They choose Rick Jones as their \"herald\" to help humans survive an \"upcoming crisis\".\n\n\n\nThe Watchers appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" where their close-up appearances are portrayed by Walt Linscott. They are seen in both in the film and a post-credits scene. In these scenes, an informant of theirs (portrayed by Stan Lee) tells the uninterested group of Watchers about the experiences he has had on Earth when they meet with him on an asteroid. During the post-credits part, the Watchers meeting with their informant take their leave as the informant protests that they are his only ride back to Earth. Director and screenwriter James Gunn has stated that the scene was created because of the online fan-theory that Stan Lee's cameos throughout the franchise are due to his relation to the Watchers.\n\nThe Watchers are referenced in \"\". If the player asks Uatu about the Watchers, Uatu will bring up a history of the Watchers introducing technology to the residents of Prosilicus.\n\nThe Watcher is the title of a web series that runs on Marvel's official YouTube page hosted and written by Lorraine Cink, featuring news about Marvel comics, film, television, and toys.\n\n"}

The album is produced by Lovich and Les Chappell with additional production by Roger Bechirian and Alan Winstanley. It was recorded at the Wisseloord Studios in Hilversum, Netherlands. She worked with Chappell and Judge Smith on writing the songs.\n\nThe cover sleeve depicts Lovich wearing a wedding dress and playing with hockey pucks on a string. It was taken inside a stainless steel fermentation tank at a Guinness brewery, after it had been emptied prior to cleaning. It caused controversy and few members of the Baptist church tried to get the album banned in the United States, saying it depicted an act of witchcraft.\n\nLovich described \"Flex\" as her more introverted album. After its release, it received relatively positive reviews praising album's enhanced production compared to her previous album \"Stateless\"' rough sound. It was also more successful in charts, peaking at number 94 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number 19 on the UK Albums Chart. The lead single \"Bird Song\" peaked at number 39 on the UK Singles Chart. The following singles were \"Angels\" and \"What Will I Do Without You?\", of which the latter peaked at number 58.\n\nThe release of the album was followed by Lovich's first sold-out tour in the United States and a three-month tour within Europe, the highlight of which was a sold-out show in front of 10,000 fans in Belgrade.\n\nAfter the release of her successful debut album \"Stateless\" (1978), Lovich embarked on the Be Stiff '78 tour along with four other artists from the recording label. In the middle of 1979, she had two top 20 hits, \"Lucky Number\" and \"Say When\", and was voted \"Top Female Recording Artist of the Year\" by Music Week. She went on to record her second more improved album and enhance the quality of productions by using modern technology and instruments to achieve a better sound than her previous record. She again collaborated with Les Chappell and also brought Judge Smith, who wrote two songs on the album. \"Flex\" was recorded at the Wisseloord Studios in Hilversum, Netherlands.\n\nDescribed as Lovich's more introverted album, \"Flex\" deals with subjects that include more of emotional and mental activity, and are often inspired by dream images. The opening track \"Bird Song\" was written by Lovich and Les Chappell. When Lovich woke up in the night from a dream, she recorded different sounds on a tape recorder. The recording later served as an inspiration for the song, where at the beginning she mimics the sounds of birds. \"What Will I Do Without You?\" is a song written especially for the album by Judge Smith. Another song written by him appears on the album, \"You Can't Kill Me\", which he had already written in 1972. It deals with reincarnation. \"Angels\" is a song dedicated to people who like to live dangerously. Lovich spoke on people who do dangerous jobs and that they serve as an inspiration to other people. She also said, working in the music industry can be sometimes mentally damaging, but is also a good recreation. \"The Night\" is a cover of The Four Seasons' song. Lovich picked up the record in a second hand shop out of curiosity, since she had been interested in the band's music and later decided to record it for the album.\n\nIn \"Egghead\", Lovich sings about people constantly learning a lot of facts, but not understanding life and practical things. In \"Wonderful One\", she expresses her feelings about music and how blessed she feels being able to create it. \"Monkey Talk\" was allegedly inspired by two books, one by Charles Darwin and \"Planet of the Apes\" by Pierre Boulle. It points out the transience of success. Using the image of Joan of Arc, \"Joan\" speaks about the necessity of self-confidence to trust your own ideas.\n\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\n"}

Dargel has also sung music by other living composers, including Eve Beglarian, k. terumi shorb, Phil Kline, Nick Brooke, and Pauline Oliveros. Formally trained in music composition, Dargel studied with Oliveros, John Luther Adams, and Brenda Hutchinson, and received a B.M. from Oberlin.\n\nAccording to Dargel, \"The singer-songwriter approach to art song composition is a natural and refreshing alternative to the hegemony of traditional art song and operatic performance.\" Dargel typically writes both words and music for all of his songs and, in his earlier compositions, he accompanies his own voice with a prepared electronic soundtrack. His debut album, \"Less Famous Than You\", released in May 2006 on Use Your Teeth records, is clearly within the singer-songwriter tradition despite its incorporation of totalist rhythmic relationships. But his follow-up, \"Other People's Love Songs\", released in 2008 on the contemporary classical label New Amsterdam Records, further blurs the lines between indie pop and the conceptual and post-minimalist conceits of downtown contemporary classical music.\n\nIn May 2010, New Amsterdam released a follow-up, a 2-CD set entitled \"Someone Will Take Care of Me\", which combines two song-cycles performed by Dargel with live musicians most usually associated with contemporary classical music performance: On \"Removable Parts\", he is joined by pianist Kathleen Supové, and on \"Thirteen Near-Death Experiences\" he is joined by members of the International Contemporary Ensemble [ICE] and composer/drummer David T. Little. The instrumentation for these two cycles clearly references the classical song cycle tradition; the former voice and piano combination is the original instrumentation for 19th century romantic song cycles (e.g. Franz Schubert's \"Die schöne Müllerin\", Robert Schumann's \"Dichterliebe\", etc.), while the latter's small ensemble of flute, clarinet, violin, cello, and piano was introduced by Arnold Schoenberg for his 1912 song cycle \"Pierrot Lunaire\" and, with or without the addition of a percussionist, has become a ubiquitous ensemble for the performance of 20th and 21st century classical music and has been also used in countless vocal works including Peter Maxwell Davies's \"Eight Songs for a Mad King\".\n\n"}

He established new track records in three races and was inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame. Manikato was the second Australian horse, after Kingston Town, to win $1 million in stakes, and, by today's standards, won 20 races which are currently (2012) classed as Group One (G1) races.\n\nHe was a tall, heavily topped chestnut gelding by the VRC Newmarket Handicap winner Manihi from Markato by Natural Bid (USA). Markato was the dam of eight named foals, but Manikato was her only stakes-winner. Costing only A$3,500, Manikato had a double cross of Fair Trial in the fourth generation (4m x 4f) and was a descendant of Nearco through his dam.\n\nHe was originally trained by Bon Hoysted who died soon after Manikato's 1978 Golden Slipper victory. His brother Bob Hoysted took over his training subsequently.\n\nAs a two-year-old, Manikato won the Blue Diamond Stakes and Golden Slipper Stakes double.\n\nManikato won eight races and was second three times out of twelve starts. He finished second three times, including one to champion stayer, Dulcify, in the Australian Cup over 2,000 metres.\n\nManikato commenced the season with a win in the Ascot Vale Stakes in record time. Three weeks later he started against older horses in the Marlboro Cup which he also won. In the Caulfield Guineas Manikato defeated Karaman by about two lengths after a protest against him was dismissed, but his jockey Gary Willetts was suspended. \nHe then started in the Craven A Stakes (now known as the Salinger Stakes) but had a slight rise in temperature on the day of the race. Manikato was defeated in this race by Always Welcome by the margin of a neck.\nAfter being spelled Manikato won the first of his five victories in the William Reid Stakes on 29 January 1979. The C F Orr Stakes at Sandown was Manikato’s next start and another victory. His win the Futurity Stakes was the first of four wins that he had in this race. In 1978 the race was run over 1800 metres and in his first attempt at a distance beyond a mile, Manikato won untouched and easing up by 4 lengths in a course record time. IAt his next start in the Australian Cup over 2000 metres he was taken on in front by three horses during the running and was only caught in the shadows of the post by Dulcify who was unbeaten at Flemington until his tragic injury in the 1979 Melbourne Cup, Manikato next started in the George Ryder Stakes where he dropped back 500 metres in distance and won by six lengths, again in record time with Joyita finishing second.\nA week later Manikato started as a 3yo in the Doncaster Handicap carrying 57.5 kg. This was 3.5 kg over the weight carrying record for a three-year-old in the Doncaster held by Tontonan, himself a great champion of the Australian turf. Manikato was again challenged for the lead throughout the race and dead heated for third place. A new Australian record was set for the 1,600 metres race. \nIn early July 1979 Manikato was taken to Brisbane for the Rothmans 100,000 (now known by its original name of the Doomben 10,000). Carrying a 3yo weight record of 58 kg he equalled Baguette’s weight carrying record and became the first 3yo to win over $500,000 in prize money.\n\nFive weeks later Manikato started his 4yo season with the first of two wins in the Freeway Stakes. On 24 September 1981 he finished second in the Marlboro Cup over 1,400 metres after he struck himself and was galloped on during the running of the race. He won William Reid Stakes and Futurity Stakes. In Sydney Manikato won the G1 George Ryder Stakes. Two weeks later he started in the AJC Galaxy Stakes with 60.5 kg and finished in 8th position. After the race he was found to have suffered a bleeding attack.\n\nIn 1981 Manikato won the William Reid Stakes, Futurity Stakes and Orr Stakes again. In the autumn Manikato had to overcome serious adversity again when he damaged his suspensory tendons. After every race, Bon wrapped the horse's legs with plastic shopping bags filled with ice, to reduce inflammation.\nAfter a spell Manikato resumed racing at Sandown with a win on 1 September 1981 in a handicap in carrying 63.5 kg. Two weeks later he lined up in the Marlboro Cup with 60.5 kg finishing second to Soldier of Fortune to whom he conceded 8 kg. \nOn 29 September 1981 Manikato started in the Queen Elizabeth Cup run in honour of the Queen’s attendance at the Caulfield meeting. Manikato won from Lawman with Sovereign Red in third place and equalled the course record of 1:35.7. His next start was in the Chirnside Stakes where he finished second.\n\nAfter a spell Manikato returned to again win the William Reid Stakes. Four weeks later on 24 February 1982 Manikato contested his fourth consecutive Futurity Stakes but finished second this time. In the Canterbury Stakes at Sydney two weeks later Manikato defeated Opera Prince and Ubetido. He then finished third in the All Aged Stakes before being spelled for 18 weeks.\n\nDuring 1982/3 season Manikato had 11 starts for five wins including the Freeway Stakes, Futurity Stakes, A J Moir Stakes, William Reid Stakes and Memsie Stakes.\n\nHe had 47 starts for 29 wins, 9 seconds and 4 thirds, including five successive William Reid Stakes and four Futurity Stakes winning 11 Group 1 races in all for $1,154,210.\n\nAfter retiring from racing in 1983, Manikato was plagued by a virus which he could not shake off. He was humanely euthanized on 13 February 1984. He is buried within sight of some of his greatest wins in \"Manikato's Garden\" at Moonee Valley Racecourse.\n\nThe Group 1 Manikato Stakes, named in his honour is contested annually at the Moonee Valley Racecourse. The Manikato Restaurant in the grandstand at Caulfield Racecourse is also named in his honour.\n\nHe was inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\n\n"}

F.\" Frank Doherty (14 October 1872 – 29 December 1910) was a British tennis player and the older brother of tennis player Laurence Doherty. He was known in the tennis world as \"R.F.\" rather than \"Reggie\". He was a four-time Wimbledon singles champion and a triple Olympic Gold medalist in doubles and mixed doubles.\n\nDoherty was born on 14 October 1872 at Beulah Villa in Wimbledon, Surrey, the oldest son of William Doherty, a printer, and his wife, Catherine Ann Davis. Doherty began tennis early in life and as a boy at Westminster School showed great promise. At age 14 he won the boys' singles title at an open championship in Llandudno. Doherty was educated at the University of Cambridge (Trinity Hall), where he played for the Cambridge University Lawn Tennis Club. In 1895 and 1895 he was part of the Cambridge team that beat Oxford and won the Scottish and Essex championships.\n\nGrand Slams\n\nDoherty played in his first Wimbledon Championships in 1894 and lost in the first round to Clement Cazalet in four sets. In 1897 Doherty won his first singles Wimbledon title after beating reigning champion Harold Mahony in three straight sets (6–4, 6–4, 6–3). He successfully defended his title for the next three years (1898, 1899, 1900). In 1898 he did so by beating his brother in the Challenge Round in five sets (6–3, 6–3, 2–6, 5–7, 6–1). In 1901 he finally lost his Wimbledon crown when he was defeated in the Challenge Round by Arthur Gore in four sets (6–4, 5–7, 4–6, 4–6). He was also a runner-up at the US Championships in 1902 where he was beaten by the defending American champion William Larned in four sets (6–4, 2–6, 4–6, 6–8). Together with his brother Laurie he won eight Wimbledon Championships doubles titles and two US Championship doubles titles.\n\nDavis Cup\n\nDoherty represented the British Isles in the prestigious Davis Cup contest from 1902 to 1906. In 1902 he won the doubles match with his brother but lost the final and decisive singles match against American Malcolm Whitman in straight sets (1–6, 5–7, 4–6). In 1903 he contributed significantly to his team's first Davis Cup title against the United States by winning the doubles match and the decisive singles match against Robert Wrenn. Doherty won the Davis Cup trophy a further three times (1904, 1905, 1906) although in these years he only competed, and won, in the doubles matches.\n\nOlympics\n\nDoherty won the doubles title (gold medals were not given at the 1900 Games) at the 1900 Olympic Games in Paris with his brother. He also competed in the singles tournament and reached the semifinal, where he was scheduled to play against his brother. Reggie withdrew, since the brothers refused to play each other before the final. He also won the mixed doubles title with five-time Wimbledon champion Charlotte Cooper. Doherty did not compete in the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis. In the 1908 Olympics in London Reggie again won the doubles title, this time with compatriot George Hillyard.\n\nR.F. Doherty was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1980 together with his brother.\n\nDoherty died of heart failure and neurasthenia on 29 December 1910 at age 38 at his home in Kensington a day after returning from a convalescence stay in a sanatorium in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nAccording to his obituary in The New York Times, Doherty had \"been in ill health for some time\". The article further stated, he \"held at various times every important championship the world of tennis has for a man to win. He was not beaten until he began to fail in health\". Both brothers apparently suffered from respiratory problems throughout their lives.\n\nR.F. and his brother had been urged to take up lawn tennis by their father, reportedly for health reasons.\n\n"}
{"id": "2137362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2137362", "title": "Puss Gets the Boot", "text": "Puss Gets the Boot\n\nPuss Gets the Boot is a 1940 American one-reel animated cartoon and is the first short in what would become the \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoon series. It was directed by William Hanna, Joseph Barbera and Rudolf Ising, and produced by Rudolf Ising and Fred Quimby. As was the practice of MGM shorts at the time, only Rudolf Ising is credited. It was released to theaters on February 10, 1940 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nA cat named Jasper takes great pleasure in tormenting a mouse named Jinx (not referred to in name on-screen), who is trying to run away from Jasper while he keeps grabbing Jinx's tail to keep him from running anywhere. Eventually, Jinx breaks free but goes into Jasper's mouth, narrowly escaping. Jasper then draws a mouse hole on the wall to trick Jinx into entering it. Jinx bangs against the wall so hard that it knocks him silly. Jasper revives him using water from the fish tank and picks him up. Having slowly realized the situation, Jinx punches Jasper in the eye, causing him to yelp and screeched in pain. The angered cat chases Jinx and accidentally bumps into a Greek pillar, where it breaks upon falling onto him along with the flowerpot that was standing on it. Mammy Two Shoes enters the room and scolds Jasper for his unacceptable behavior, issuing him an ultimatum that if she catches him making one more mess, he will get kicked out of the house. Jasper sulks off, Jinx chuckles at him and this causes Jasper to chase him, but when Jinx holds a glass over the edge of the table, Jasper backs off after seeing a furious Mammy walking away with the remains of the broken flowerpot, fearing that he will get himself into trouble again.\n\nAfter Jinx puts the cup down, seeing his chance, Jasper rushes at him, but he holds back Jasper by threatening to drop the glass again. Then Jinx drops the cup and Jasper rushes to catch it. Jinx throws more cups, making it very hard for Jasper to catch them all. As Jinx walks away with the last cup, feeling pretty smug that he has the advantage, Jasper gets the idea: he drops a bunch of pillows on the ground. When Jinx tries to humiliate Jasper by dropping the cup, it stays intact when it lands on the soft surface of one of the pillows. Jinx tries to escape but Jasper catches him by the tail. Jasper inadvertently throws Jinx onto a shelf, where he escapes and begins pelting him with several dishes, making sure that in order to blackmail Jasper, he will force him to immediately \"get the boot\". Jasper begins to feel tired of holding all the dishes, after which, in humiliation, Jasper can only watch as Jinx drops one last dish on the ground, breaking it, and thus alerting Mammy to thinking Jasper violated her ultimatum.\n\nMammy once again enters the room in frustration just as Jinx swims in Jasper's milk bowl, uses his tail as a towel and finally kicks Jasper, causing Jasper to drop all of the dishes, creating a huge mess and forcing him to take the blame. Enraged, Mammy hits and throws Jasper out of the house and shuts the door. As soon as Jasper is kicked out from the house, Jinx waves to him, sticks his tongue out, puts a HOME SWEET HOME sign in front of his hole, and enters it.\n\n\nIn June 1937, animator and storyman Joseph Barbera began to work for the Ising animation unit at MGM, then the largest studio in Hollywood. He learned that co-owner Louis B. Mayer wished to boost the animation department by encouraging the artists to develop some new cartoon characters, following the lack of success with its earlier cartoon series based on the \"Captain and the Kids\" comic strip. Barbera then teamed with fellow Ising unit animator and director William Hanna and pitched new ideas, among them was the concept of two \"equal characters who were always in conflict with each other\". An early thought involved a fox and a dog before they settled on a cat and mouse. The pair discussed their ideas with producer Fred Quimby, then the head of the short film department who, despite a lack of interest in it, gave them the green-light to produce one cartoon short.\n\nThe short, \"Puss Gets the Boot\", featured a cat named Jasper and an unnamed mouse, named Jinx in pre-production, and an African American housemaid named Mammy Two Shoes. Leonard Maltin described it as \"very new and special [...] that was to change the course of MGM cartoon production\" and established the successful \"Tom and Jerry\" formula of comical cat and mouse chases with slapstick gags. It was released onto the theatre circuit on February 10, 1940, and the pair, having been advised by management not to produce any more, focused on other cartoons including \"Gallopin' Gals\" (1940) and \"Officer Pooch\" (1941). Matters changed, however, when Texas businesswoman Bessa Short sent a letter to MGM asking whether more cat and mouse shorts would be produced, which helped convince management to commission a series. A studio contest held to rename both characters was won by animator John Carr, who suggested Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse after the Christmastime drink. Carr was awarded a first place prize of $50. \"Puss Gets the Boot\" was a critical success, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Short Subject: Cartoons in 1941 despite the credits listing Ising and omitting Hanna and Barbera.\n\nAfter MGM gave the green-light for Hanna and Barbera to continue, the studio entered production on \"The Midnight Snack\" (1941). The pair would continue to work on \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons for the next fifteen years of their career.\n\nBlu-ray\nDVD\nVHS\nLaserdisc\n\n"}

After a careful education abroad, concluding with one year under Cesare Cremonini at Padua, he returned to Denmark in 1629 and quickly won the favor of King Christian IV. In 1634 he was made a Knight of the Order of the Elephant, in 1636 became Councillor of State, in 1637 Governor of Copenhagen, and in 1643 Steward of the Realm. He is commonly known and recognized as the most notorious traitor in Danish history.\nIn 1637 Ulfeldt married Leonora Christina (1621–1698) who was the daughter of King Christian IV of Denmark.\nShe had been betrothed to him from her ninth year. Ulfeldt was the most striking personality at the Danish court in all superficial accomplishments, but his character was marked by ambition, avarice and absolute lack of honor or conscience. He was largely responsible for the disasters of the Swedish war of 1643-45, and when the Treaty of Brömsebro was signed there was a violent scene between him and the King, though Ulfeldt's resignation was not accepted.\n\nIn December 1646 he was sent as ambassador extraordinary to the Hague, but the results of his embassy by no means corresponded to its costliness, and when he returned to Denmark in July 1647 he found the king profoundly irritated. Ulfeldt, supported by the Rigsråd and the nobility, who objected to Christian's fiscal policy, resisted his father-in-law, and triumphed completely. As Steward of the Realm he was the virtual ruler of Denmark during the two months which elapsed between the death of Christian IV and the election of Frederick III (6 July 1648); but the new king was by no means disposed to tolerate the outrageous usurpations of Ulfeldt and his wife, and this antagonism was still further complicated by allegations of a plot (ultimately proved to be false, but believed at the time to be true) on the part of Dina Vinhofvers, a former mistress of Ulfeldt, to poison the royal family. Dina was convicted of perjury and executed, but Ulfeldt no longer felt secure at Copenhagen, and on the day after the execution he secretly left Denmark (14 July 1651) with his family.\n\nAfter living for a time in concealment at Amsterdam, Ulfeldt moved to Stralsund in Swedish Pomerania. In 1657, King Charles X of Sweden invaded Denmark. In July 1657, Ulfeldt responded to the King's invitation to enter his service. Sweden was Denmark's deadliest foe. Ulfeldt's purpose was twofold: humiliate his monarch and secure a personal fortune. He persuaded the commandant of Nakskov (a strategically crucial fortress) to surrender to Charles X, and did his best to convince his countrymen that resistance was useless. He even loaned the Swedish king a fortune to finance the war with money that, it is believed, was embezzled from the Danish state. Finally, as one of the Swedish negotiators at the Treaty of Taastrup, he was instrumental in assuring the humiliation of his native land.\n\nUlfeldt's treason was rewarded by Charles X of Sweden with ennoblement as the Count of Sölvesborg in Blekinge; however a discontented Ulfeldt instead began intriguing against his new master. He was soon discovered, and in May 1659 was sentenced to death. On 7 July the Swedish regents amnestied him, and he returned to Copenhagen to try to make his peace with his lawful sovereign, who promptly imprisoned him and his wife. In the summer of 1660 they were conveyed to Hammershus in Bornholm, as prisoners of state.\n\nTheir captivity was severe to brutal and they were released in September 1661 in the most degrading conditions. The fallen magnate henceforth dreamed of nothing but revenge, and in the course of 1662, during his residence at Bruges, he offered the Danish crown to the Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg, proposing to raise a rebellion in Denmark for that purpose. Frederick William betrayed Ulfeldt's treason to Frederick III, and the Danish government at once impeached the traitor; on 24 July 1663 he and his children were degraded, his property was confiscated, and he was condemned to be beheaded and quartered.\n\nHe escaped from the country, but the sentence was actually carried out on his effigy; and a pillory was erected on the ruins of his mansion at Copenhagen. During a new flight he died February 1664 in a boat on the Rhine not far from Basel. The circumstances of his death or his final resting place are not known.\n\nTo posterity Corfits Ulfeldt has stood as the prototype of a traitor in Danish history. In addition, modern historians have been liable to view him as a highly mentally unstable man whose lust for power ended in megalomania and insanity.\n\nIn contrast his wife Leonora Christina has been admired because of her long time as a prisoner after his death. She spent twenty-one years in confinement in the royal dungeon, Blåtårn, prior to her release during 1685. \n\"Jammers Minde\" is an autobiography completed in 1674 by Leonora Christina. It was first published in 1869 and translated into English as \"Memoirs of Leonora Christina\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2137376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2137376", "title": "HMGN", "text": "HMGN\n\nHMGN (High Mobility Group Nucleosome-binding) proteins are members of the broader class of high mobility group (HMG) chromosomal proteins that are involved in regulation of transcription, replication, recombination, and DNA repair.\n\nHMGN1 and HMGN2 (initially designated HMG-14 and HMG-17 respectively) were discovered by E.W. Johns research group in the early 1970s. HMGN3, HMGN4, and HMGN5 were discovered later and are less abundant. HMGNs are nucleosome binding proteins that help in transcription, replication, recombination, and DNA repair. They can also alter the chromatin epigenetic landscape, helping to stabilize cell identity. There is still relatively little known about their structure and function. HMGN proteins are found in all vertebrates, and play a role in chromatin structure and histone modification. HMGNs come in long chains of amino acids, containing around 100 for HMGN1-4, and roughly 200 in HMGN5. Recent research on the HMGN family is focused on their effect on cell identity, and how reduction of HMGNs relates to induced reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).\n\nMuch of the research that has been done HMGN proteins have been done in vitro, while there is relatively little on the in vivo function and roles of HMGN proteins.\n\nDue to these proteins being predominantly found in higher eukaryotes, the use of microorganisms and other lower eukaryotes has deemed insufficient to determine the in vivo roles of HMGN proteins. A study was done with knockout mice to see the effect if any that HMGN proteins play on a full organism level. This resulted in the mice showing increasing sensitivity to UV radiation when having less than normal levels of HMGN(2). This would indicate that HMGN might facilitate repair of UV damage. The same increase in sensitivity was observed  in mice when exposed to gamma radiation, however the cellular processes that repair DNA in either case are drastically different, leading to an inconclusive state whether HMGN proteins facilitate DNA repair in vivo.\n\nHMGN1 and HMGN2 do not co-localize within living cells. This is indication of possible different roles of each HMGN.\n\nHMGN proteins are part of broader group of proteins referred to as High Mobility group chromosomal (HMG) proteins. This larger group was named this for their high electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gels and is differentiated into 3 distinct but related groups, one of them being HMGN proteins. HMGN family can be further divided into specific proteins, these being HMGN1, HMGN2, HMGN3, HMGN4, and HMGN5.  The overall sizes of the proteins vary to each specific one, but HMGN1-4 average 100 amino acids. Whereas the larger HMGN5 proteins are 300+ amino acids long in mice and roughly 200 in length for humans.\n\nHMGN1 and HMGN2 are among the most common of the HMGN proteins. The main purpose and function are reducing the compaction of the cellular chromatin by nucleosome binding. NMR evidence shows that reducing compaction occurs when the proteins targets the main elements that are responsible for the compactions of the chromatin. These have an expression rates that correlate to the differentiation of the cells it is present in. Areas that have experienced differentiation have reduced expression levels in comparison to undifferentiated areas, where HMGN1 and HMGN2 are highly expressed.\n\nHMGN3 has two variants, HMGN3a and HMGN3b. Unlike the HMGN1 and HMGN2 proteins, both forms of HMGN3 tend to be tissue and development specific. They are only expressed in certain tissues at specific developmental stages. There is no preference to a certain tissue given by the two variants of the HMGN3 proteins. There is equal likelihood that either be present in a certain highly expressed HMGN3 tissue. The brain and the eyes in particular are areas that HMGN3 is heavily expressed as well as in adult pancreatic islet cells. It has been shown that the loss of HMGN3 in mice has led to a mild onset of diabetes due to ineffective insulin secretion.\n\nThe discovery of HMGN4 was done by GenBank during a database search and identified it as a \"new HMGN2 like transcript\", indicating that HMGN4 is closely related to HMGN2. There has been very little research done on HMGN4 proteins. The gene associated with the production of the HMGN4 is located in a region associated with schizophrenia on chromosome 6. Until this point every kind of HMGN has been identified in the vertebrates, but HMGN4 has only been seen and identified in primates. Within humans, HMGN4 has shown high levels of expression in the thyroid, thymus and the lymph nodes.\n\nThe most recent addition to the HMGN protein family is of HMGN5. It is larger than the previous HMGNs, containing 300+ amino acids, due to a long C-terminal domain that varies with species, explaining  why mice and humans have a different size of HMGN5. Its biological function is unknown but has shown expression in placental development. There have also been cases where HMGN5 was present in human tumors including, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, etc. For this reason, it is thought that HMGN5 might have some link to cancer and might be a potential target for cancer therapy in the future.\n\nThe location of HMGN during mitosis is the subject of several studies. It is very difficult to date their intra-nuclear organization during the various stages of cell cycle. There is a superfamily of abundance and ubiquitous nuclear proteins that bind to chromatin without any known DNA sequence, which is composed of HMGA, HMBG, and HMGN families. HMGA is associated with chromatin throughout the cell cycle, located in the scaffold of the metaphase chromosome. Both HMGB and HMGN are associated with the mitotic chromosome. The interactions of all HMGs with chromatin is highly dynamic, proteins move constantly throughout the nucleus.\n\nThe sample nucleosomes for potential binding sites in a \"stop and go\" manner, with the \"stop\" step being longer than the \"go\" step. Through the use of immunofluorescence studies, live cell imaging, gel mobility shift assays, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, the above was determined and also by comparing the chromatin binding properties of wild-type and HMGN mutant proteins. In conclusion, HMGNs can associate with mitotic chromatin. However, the binding of HMGN to mitotic chromatin is not dependent on a functional HMGN nucleosomal binding domain, and weaker than the binding to interphase nucleosomes in which HMGNs form specific complexes with nucleosomes.\n\nNucleosomes serve as the protein core (made from 8 histones) for DNA to wrap around, functioning as a foundation for the larger and more condensed chromatin structures of chromosomes. HMGN proteins compete with Histone H1 (linker histone not part of the core nucleosome) for nucleosome binding sites. Once occupied one protein cannot displace the other. However both proteins are not permanently associated to the nucleosomes and can be removed via post transcriptional modifications. In the case of HMGN proteins, Protein kinase C (PKC) can phosphorylate the serine amino acids in the nucleosome binding domain present in all HMGN variants. This gives HMGNs a mobile character as they are continuously able to bind and unbind to nucleosomes depending on the intracellular environment and signaling.\n\nActive competition between HMGNs and H1 serve an active role in chromatin remodeling and as result play a role in the cell cycle and cellular differentiation where chromatin compaction and de-compaction determine if certain genes are expressed or not. Histone acetylation is usually associated with open chromatin, and histone methylation is usually associated with closed chromatin.\n\nWith use of ChIP-sequencing it is possible to study DNA paired with proteins to determine what kind of histone modifications are present when the nucleosomes are bound to either H1 or HMGNs. Using this method it was found that H1 presence corresponded to high levels of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, which means that the H3 histone is heavily methylated suggesting that the chromatin structure is closed. It was also found that HMGN presence corresponded to high levels of H3K27ac and H3K4me1, conversely meaning that the H3 histone methylation is greatly reduced suggesting the chromatin structure is open.\n\nWhile the role of HMGNs are still being researched, it is clear that the absence of HMGNs in knock out (KO) and knock down (KD) studies result in a significant difference of a cell's total transcriptional activity. Several transcriptome studies have been conducted which show various other genes are either unregulated or down regulated due to HMGN absence.\n\nInterestingly in the case of HMGN1&2 only knocking out HMGN1 or HMGN2 results in changes for just few genes. But when you knock out both HMGN1&2 there is far more pronounced effect with regard to changes in gene activity. For example, in mice brain when only HMGN1 was knocked out only 1 gene was up-regulated, when only HMGN2 was knocked out 19 genes were up-regulated and 29 down-regulated. But when both HMGN1&2 are knocked out 50 genes were up-regulated and 41 down-regulated. If you simply tallied the totals for the HMGN1 and HMGN2 knock outs you would not get the same results as an HMGN1&2 DKO (double knock out).\n\nThis is described as functional compensation since both HMGN1 and HMGN2 are only slightly different in terms of protein structure and essentially do the same thing. They have largely the same affinity for nucleosomal binding sites. That means a lot of times if HMGN1 is absent, HMGN2 can fill in and vis versa. Using ChIP-seq it was found in mice chromosomes there were 16.5K sites were both HMGN1&2 could bind, 14.6K sites that had HMGN1 preference and only 6.4K sites that had HMGN2 preference. Differences in HMGN1 and HMGN2 activity are pronounced in the brain, thymus, liver, and spleen suggesting HMGN variants also have specialized roles in addition to their overlapping functionality.\n\nThis overlapping functionality may seem redundant or even deleterious, however these proteins are integral to various cellular processes, especially differentiation and embryogenesis as it provides a means for dynamic chromatin modeling. For example, in mice embryo, during ocular development HMGN1,2&3. HMGN1 expression is elevated during initial stages of eye development in progenitor cells, but is decreased in newly formed and fated cells, such as lens fiber cells. HMGN2 in contrast stays elevated in both embryonic and adult eye cells. HMGN3 was found to be especially elevated at 2 weeks (for an adult mouse) in the inner nuclear and ganglion cells. This shows there is an uneven distribution of HMGNs in pre-fated and adult cells.\n\nIn human brain development HMGNs have been shown to be a critical component of neural differentiation and are elevated in neural stem cells (neural progenitor cells). For example, in a knock down study, loss of HMGN1,2&3 resulted in lower population of astrocyte cells and higher population of neural progenitor cells.\n\nIn oligodendrocyte differentiation HMGNs are critical, since when HMGN1&2 are both knocked out the population of oligodendrocytes in spinal tissue was reduced 65%. However, due to functional compensation this effect is not observed when only HMGN1 or HMGN2 are knocked. This observation if not just correlation. With ChIP-seq analysis it is shown that chromatin modeling at the OLIG1&2 genes (transcription factors involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation) is in an open conformation and has HMGNs bound to the nucleosomes.\n\nIt can be inferred that this redundancy is actually beneficial as the presence of at least one HMGN variant vastly improves tissue differentiation and development. These findings are summarized in the figure to the right.\n\n"}

In the PWF the team was managed by George South. The duo would return to the PWF in 1996 and won the PWF Tag Team Title.\n\nWhile in the USWA the team feuded with Jerry Lawler, Jeff Jarrett and other faces being pushed as the “Monster threat” due to their size. Their work in the PWF and the USWA got them noticed by the WWF and they were signed to a contract in 1993.\n\nWhen Men on a Mission began appearing on WWF television on June 14, 1993, their vicious heel gimmick had been repackaged as faces. They wore bright clothes, had positive attitudes, and teamed with a rapping manager called “Oscar” and they were now known as “Mabel”, “Oscar”, and “Mo”, collectively “M.O.M.” or “Men On a Mission”. They had the image of three people who could be loved by the crowd but who were also attempting to make positive changes in their neighborhood. This was accomplished through use of several vignettes showing them walking down streets in the ghetto but saying positive things and talking about how things could be made better.\n\nThe team met with moderate success and got over with the crowd because of Mabel’s unusual size, their in-ring personas, and Oscar’s crowd pleasing raps. Their fun loving personalities were prominently displayed at the 1993 Survivor Series, when they, along with The Bushwhackers, dressed up as Doink the Clown and wrestled as \"The Four Doinks\" in a comedy match against Bam Bam Bigelow, Bastion Booger, and The Headshrinkers. The team even won the match in comedic fashion, with all four team members garnering the pin on Bigelow. Their next feud was against the WWF Tag Team Champions The Quebecers. Men on a Mission won the titles on March 29, 1994 at a house show in London, England. This happened when the large Mabel fell on Pierre and stunned him. When the ref went to make his count, Pierre did not kick out as was scripted. Two days later, to fix the error, the Quebecers regained the titles in Sheffield, England. The title change was also reported on WWF television.\n\nMen on a Mission were temporarily sidelined when Mo injured his leg in a singles match against Owen Hart on the May 1st episode of Wrestling Challenge (taped April 12th in Syracuse, NY). Mo would not return to competition until October ; meanwhile Mabel, who was seen as the big star of the group, began wrestling more singles matches in an attempt to get over as a solo wrestler. He was also used to help get rising stars over, due to his size. \n\nMen on a Mission returned to regular teaming in late 1994, and moved almost immediately back into the Tag Team Championship picture. The team was entered in an eight-team tournament for the WWF Tag Team Championship, which was vacant at the time due to champions Shawn Michaels and Diesel breaking up. The team was eliminated in the first round on December 17, 1994 by Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow (who went on to lose in the tournament final to Bob \"Spark Plugg\" Holly and The 1-2-3 Kid). After that they continued to climb the ranks in the tag division, culminating in a match against the then champion Smoking Gunns on an episode of \"Action Zone\" which aired in March 1995. The Gunns defeated Mabel and Mo, who responded by attacking them postmatch as a precursor to a villainous turn.\n\nThe next week on \"Action Zone\" Oscar offered an apology to The Gunns, and on the show after that Mabel and Mo decided to bring out the Gunns to shake their hands. After shaking their hands and raising the arms of the Gunns, Mabel and Mo then responded by clotheslining Billy and Bart Gunn to the mat. As Mabel repeatedly splashed Bart while Mo assaulted Billy, Oscar tried to intervene and pleaded with his charges to stop. Mo shoved Oscar to the mat and held him there while Mabel nailed him with a running leg drop, completing the heel turn as Mabel and Mo mocked the Gunns by parading around the ring wearing their cowboy hats and antagonized the fans. With the turn, Mabel and Mo dropped the rapping and \"trying to make a difference\" characters and reverted to the ruthless thug characters they portrayed before joining the WWF.\n\nOriginally, Oscar was to remain as the team's manager, but he objected to the idea of the heel turn and decided to leave the company. In an interview for Pro Wrestling Insider, Oscar explained that the reason why he signed on to be part of Men on a Mission was that he was a positive person and believed in the nature of the characters, and turning them into thugs was something he did not want to be part of. He retired from wrestling after the turn.\n\nAfter a short feud with the Smokin’ Gunns, Mabel returned to singles competition and was immediately given the spot as the top villain in the company. He won the 1995 King of the Ring and began referring to himself as King Mabel, with Mo becoming Sir Mo and taking on more of a managerial role. Mabel was put into a feud with Diesel, the reigning WWF Champion, with the two scheduled to wrestle at Summerslam. However, the WWF's plans changed on the August 14, 1995 broadcast of \"Monday Night Raw\". That night, Men on a Mission were to face the Allied Powers in the main event. However, Lex Luger did not show and The British Bulldog asked Diesel to team with him. Bulldog then turned heel by attacking Diesel and assisting Men on a Mission in beating him down. The entire situation was referred to on air as the \"Royal Plan\" and was to involve Jim Cornette, who took the Bulldog as a client following the match. However, the feud between Mabel and Diesel was cut off following SummerSlam after Mabel injured the champion by performing a seated senton onto his lower back.\n\nWith the Bulldog now taking over Mabel's top villain spot, Mabel was placed in a feud with The Undertaker. The feud ended just as quickly and once again, it was due to Mabel injuring his opponent as he broke several bones in Undertaker's face with a leg drop. In January 1996 they left the WWF after Royal Rumble 1996.\n\nShortly after leaving the WWF, Frazier and Horne (still wrestling as Mabel and Mo) moved to the United States Wrestling Association. They feuded with The Moondogs and Doug Gilbert and Brian Christopher. Then they were both entered in a tournament for the Unified Heavyweight Championship. Mabel defeated Mo on March 4, 1996 and went on to lose in the tournament final to Jerry Lawler. The team broke up in June 1996. They met each other once again on January 4, 1997 when Mabel won a Lumberjack match in USWA.\n\nFrazier eventually returned to the WWF as Mabel in 1998 doing a run in on 1998 King Of The Ring Ken Shamrock and getting beaten by Shamrock later that night. Frazier made an appearance in ECW as a part of The Full Blooded Italians after a match between Tracy Smothers and Tommy Rogers until Spike Dudley took him down with an acid drop. Frazier made his return at the 1999 Royal Rumble, taking on Mankind and later that night jumped one of The Headbangers to enter the Royal Rumble match. Undertaker and his Ministry of Darkness pulled him out of the match and threw him in the back of a hearse. This led to him being repackaged as Viscera, a member of the Ministry of Darkness. Frazier was released from his WWF contract in August 2000. In March 2003, Frazier, as \"Nelson Knight\", made a surprise appearance at a weekly NWA: Total Nonstop Action pay-per-view at the side of Ron Killings. A second appearance followed the next week, but Frazier soon returned to the independent circuit. On September 21, 2004, Frazier returned again to the WWE as Viscera. In 2007, he was repackaged as \"Big Daddy V\" and began appearing on the ECW brand. Frazier was released from his WWE contract on August 8, 2008. After wrestling for promotions such as the National Wrestling Alliance and the Insane Clown Posse's Juggalo Championship Wrestling, Frazier began wrestling for All Japan Pro Wrestling, as Big Daddy Voodoo, where he is a former All Asia Tag Team Champion with TARU and is part of the Voodoo Murders stable\n\nHorne stayed in the independent promotions and wrestled as both Mo and Rob Harlem. He and Frazier both resurfaced in Memphis Wrestling for a show in 2003, during which Horne (as Mo) turned on Frazier (as Mabel), which led to a one-off match which Frazier won. Horne retired from wrestling in March 1, 2006, and Frazier died of a heart attack on February 18, 2014.\n\n\n"}

He served as a journalist for the newspaper \"Le Devoir\" from 1951 to 1953 and created the publishing companies Éditions de l'Homme in 1958 and Éditions du Jour in 1961.\n\nHe was a reporter during the Wilbert Coffin trial in 1954 and he later published two books on the subject: \"Coffin était innocent\" (1958) and \"J'accuse les assassins de Coffin\" (1963). The latter book caused such controversy that the provincial government established a Commission of Inquiry into the case.\n\nHébert was a close friend of Pierre Trudeau and traveled with him to the People's Republic of China in 1960 in the midst of the Great Leap Forward. The two met both Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai and recorded their observations in the book \"Deux innocents en Chine rouge\" (1961). The book was published in English as \"Two Innocents in Red China\" in 1968. A Chinese-language version was published in China in 2005 - Hébert attended the launch in Shanghai with Alexandre Trudeau.\n\nIn 1971, Hébert founded Canada World Youth, an organization that expands \"the role of youth in developing their communities and promoting world peace\".\n\nHe was appointed to the Senate on April 20, 1983, representing the senatorial division of Wellington, Quebec, and retired at the mandatory age of 75 in 1998. From 1991 to 1993 he was the Opposition Whip in the Senate and from 1993 to 1998 he was the Government Whip in the Senate.\n\nIn 1986, he went on a hunger strike for 21 days to protest a decision by the Progressive Conservative government to end the Katimavik program for Canadian youth, which he created in 1977.\n\nIn 1978, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was awarded two honorary doctorates: one from Ryerson University in 1997, and one from the University of Prince Edward Island in 2004.

{"id": "2137404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2137404", "title": "Shinji Mikami", "text": "Shinji Mikami\n\nMikami grew up in the Yamaguchi Prefecture of Honshū island. As a child, Mikami wanted to be a Formula One driver. He was also “obsessed” with the horror genre and films, such as \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" and \"The Evil Dead\". Studying karate and kendo as a teenager, he studied product and merchandise at university. Mikami graduated from Doshisha University, where he majored in the study of merchandise.\n\nMikami attended a meet-and-greet for college graduates hosted by Capcom, and was interested in the presentation enough to apply. His application was initially rejected, then he was hired by Capcom a week later “out of the blue,” according to Mikami. He joined Capcom in 1990 as a junior game designer, and soon after created his first title there, a quiz game for the Game Boy titled \"Capcom Quiz: Hatena? no Daibōken\". The game took over three months to develop. His following three games were all based on Disney-licensed properties: \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" for the Game Boy, and \"Aladdin\" and \"Goof Troop\" for the Super NES. \"Aladdin\" was his first hit, selling over 1.75 million units worldwide. Mikami also worked on \"Super Lap\", an unreleased F1 racing game for the Game Boy that was scheduled to be released in 1992, but was canceled after eight months of development.\n\nAfter the release of \"Goof Troop\", Mikami began development in 1993 of a horror-themed adventure game for the PlayStation set in a haunted mansion, called \"Resident Evil\", originally conceived as a remake of \"Sweet Home\" (an earlier Famicom game by Capcom based on the Japanese horror film of the same name). \"Resident Evil\" was initially conceived by \"Sweet Home\" director Tokuro Fujiwara; he entrusted Mikami, who was initially reluctant because he hated \"being scared\", with the project, because he \"understood what's frightening.\" Mikami said that \"Resident Evil\" was a response to his disappointment with \"Zombie\", a gory 1979 film by Italian director Lucio Fulci; Mikami was determined to make a game with none of the failings of the movie. The resulting game became \"Biohazard\", an action-adventure game which combined 3D polygonal characters and objects with pre-rendered backgrounds and featured zombies (among other monsters) heavily influenced by George A. Romero's \"Dead\" films. The game was retitled \"Resident Evil\" during its English localization under Capcom USA's suggestion and was released in Japan and North America on March 22, 1996, and became one of the PlayStation's first successful titles. It was the first game to be dubbed a survival horror, a term Capcom coined to promote the game. It was later ported to the Sega Saturn.\n\n\"Resident Evil\" was considered the defining title for survival horror games and was responsible for popularizing the genre. Its control scheme becoming a staple of the genre, and future titles would imitate its challenge of rationing highly limited resources and items. The game's commercial success is credited with helping the PlayStation become the dominant game console, and also led to a series of \"Resident Evil\" films. Mikami had creative control over the screenplay and script of the first movie being dubbed a creative consultant. They had Mikami in this position to make sure fans of the games would be happy. He then dropped out of the later movies because he believed that the movies were heading in the wrong direction. Many games have tried to replicate the successful formula seen in \"Resident Evil\", and every subsequent survival horror game has arguably taken a stance in relation to it.\n\nAfter the success of \"Resident Evil\", Mikami was promoted from planner to producer. As producer, he oversaw the development of \"Resident Evil's\" sequel, \"Resident Evil 2\", which he intended to tap into the classic notion of horror as \"the ordinary made strange,\" thus rather than setting the game in a creepy mansion no one would visit, he wanted to use familiar urban settings transformed by the chaos of a viral outbreak. The game sold over five million copies, proving the popularity of survival horror. Following its release in 1998, he oversaw the development of \"\" and also directed another survival horror title \"Dino Crisis\", both of which released in 1999.\n\nShortly after the release of \"Resident Evil 3\" in Japan, Capcom Production Studio 4 was established in 1999. The studio's staff were mainly the key developers in the company's survival horror projects. Mikami was appointed as the general manager of the studio, and worked as executive producer for various games, including the original \"Devil May Cry\" (originally conceived as a \"Resident Evil\" game). In 2000, Mikami became involved as producer of a new \"Resident Evil\" game. \"\". This game was designed from the ground up for the Dreamcast. Being a much more powerful console than the PlayStation, the Dreamcast allowed the team behind the game to add for the first time, 3D environments instead of the usual pre-rendered backgrounds. \"Resident Evil Code: Veronica\" was released in 2000 and went on to sell 1,140,000 units. That same year, Mikami's \"Dino Crisis 2\" was released, selling 1,190,000 copies worldwide.\n\nIn 2001, an expanded version of \"Code: Veronica\" was released for the Dreamcast exclusively in Japan, alongside a PlayStation 2 port that was released worldwide. This version of the game, titled \"Biohazard - Code: Veronica Complete Edition\" in Japan and \"\" abroad, added ten minutes of new cutscenes not in the original release. The PS2 version, which initially came packaged with a trial version of \"Devil May Cry\", went on to sell 1,400,000 units, according to Capcom's sales data for March 2006. In 2001, in what was to be one of his most controversial business decisions, Mikami formed an exclusivity agreement with Nintendo in which the main \"Resident Evil\" games would be sold only for the Nintendo GameCube. The GameCube would receive, in addition to ports of previous PlayStation and Dreamcast installments, three new numbered entries in the series: a remake of the original \"Resident Evil\", \"Resident Evil Zero\", and \"Resident Evil 4\". \"Resident Evil\" and \"Resident Evil Zero\" were both released in 2002.\n\nThe remake of \"Resident Evil\" was released in Japan on the sixth anniversary of the release of the original, on March 22, 2002. The remake was billed as the definitive version of the game, selling 490,000 copies in the US and 360,000 copies in Europe. In total, \"Resident Evil\" managed to sell 1,250,000 units during its first year of release. The remake's sales data was made public by Capcom during its Financial Review Report for 2002.\n\nOn November 12, 2002, \"Resident Evil Zero\" was released. Gaming site gamefront.de reported that 138,855 copies of the game were sold on its first day of release. Capcom expected \"Resident Evil Zero\" to sell 1.42 million copies, but sold only 1.12 million. The fact that \"Resident Evil Zero\" did not match or surpass the remake's sales figures, spread fear among Capcom executives and share holders. They worried that \"Resident Evil 4\" would not sell well enough on GameCube.\n\nIn spite of \"Resident Evil Zero\"s underwhelming sales, Mikami remained confident in his support for Nintendo and announced four exclusive titles for the GameCube under development by Production Studio 4 in addition to \"Resident Evil 4\"; \"P.N.03\", \"Viewtiful Joe\", \"killer7\" and \"Dead Phoenix\". This lineup became known as the Capcom Five.\n\nThe first of these games to be released was the Mikami-directed \"P.N. 03\". The game was both a commercial and critical failure, receiving lukewarm reviews from the press and selling below expectations. As a result, Mikami stepped down as manager of Production Studio 4, while remaining as one of the head producers within the team. After his failure with \"P.N.03\", Mikami decided to concentrate instead on the creative aspects of the Capcom 5. He eventually took over directorial duties for \"Resident Evil 4\" from previous director, Hiroshi Shibata. Under his direction, \"Resident Evil 4\" went through some substantial changes. \"Resident Evil 4\" was released in 2005 and was one of the GameCube's top-selling titles, selling 1,250,000 units worldwide within a year. The game was critically praised, winning many game of the year awards.\n\n\"Resident Evil 4\" is regarded as one of the most influential games of the 2000s decade, due to its influence in redefining at least two video game genres: the survival horror and the third-person shooter. \"Resident Evil 4\" attempted to redefine the survival horror genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming, thus broadening the gameplay of the series with elements from the wider action game genre. It helped redefine the third-person shooter genre by introducing a \"reliance on offset camera angles that fail to obscure the action.\" The \"over the shoulder\" viewpoint introduced in \"Resident Evil 4\" has now become standard in third-person shooters, including titles ranging from \"Gears of War\" to \"\". It has also become a standard “precision aim” feature for action games in general, with examples ranging from \"Dead Space\" and \"Grand Theft Auto\" to the \"Ratchet & Clank Future\" series.\n\nMikami touted the game as a GameCube exclusive. In an interview with a Japanese magazine, Mikami even said that he would \"commit harakiri\" if it came out on another platform. This was loosely translated as Mikami claiming to \"cut [his own] head\" and later parodied in \"God Hand\", which featured a racing dog named \"Mikami's Head\". In a 2017 interview, he apologized for \"Resident Evil 4\" going multiplatform.\n\nAfter the success of \"Resident Evil 4\", Mikami left Studio 4 and was transferred over to and originally established Clover Studio in July 2004, which employed an all-star lineup of Capcom development talent, including Atsushi Inaba (producer of \"Steel Battalion\" and \"Viewtiful Joe\"), and Hideki Kamiya (\"Devil May Cry\" director). At Clover, Mikami directed \"God Hand\", a beat 'em up comedy game that parodies American and Japanese pop culture. It was released in Japan on 14 September 2006, and on 10 October 2006 in North America. After Clover Studio was closed in 2007, Mikami joined Seeds Inc, now known as PlatinumGames, the newly formed successor of his former studio. PlatinumGames is composed of several of Mikami's former Capcom colleagues, including Hideki Kamiya, Atsushi Inaba, Yuta Kimura, Nao Ueda, Mari Shimazaki and Masami Ueda.\n\nMikami formed a private development studio called Straight Story in 2006. The name of the studio is taken from David Lynch's 1999 film. Their works are under the PlatinumGames branding and he is a contract employee (\"external board member\") of PlatinumGames. He also collaborated with Grasshopper Manufacture's Goichi Suda on Shadows of the Damned using the Unreal Engine 3 and published by EA. Mikami revealed that Straight Story will close once development of \"Vanquish\" is completed. Straight Story will be replaced with Mikami's new studio, Tango, which has already been established.\n\nMuch like \"Resident Evil\" and \"Resident Evil 4\" before it, the third-person shooter game \"Vanquish\", released in 2010, has proven to be an influential title for action games. It significantly improved upon the cover system, where in contrast to previous cover-based shooters, the cover in \"Vanquish\" is easily destructible, with often a single shot from a robotic enemy being enough to blast away the wall the player was hiding behind. The game also penalizes the player's ranking for the number of times they have taken cover, though its most important innovation is the power-slide mechanic that allows the player to slide into and out of cover at high speeds, or in bullet time when the player's health is low. The game was given GameSpot's Best Original Game Mechanic award for its rocket-sliding game mechanic, which acts as both a defensive escape and an offensive setup, opening up new gameplay possibilities for shooter games and increasing the pace significantly. The game has set a new trend, with its influence seen in other first-person shooters that have incorporated similar sliding mechanics, including \"Bulletstorm\", \"Crysis 2\", and \"Killzone 3\". \"Vanquish\" was itself inspired by Tatsunoko's 1970s anime series, \"Casshern\".\n\nA teaser website opened on March 18, 2010, titled \"Mikami Project\" with a countdown attached. The website changed into a job employment page, for Mikami's new studio, \"Tango\". On October 28, 2010 ZeniMax Media, parent company of noted game publisher Bethesda Softworks, announced Shinji Mikami joined ZeniMax after it acquired Tango Gameworks. An April 2012 \"Famitsu\" interview with Mikami revealed the codename title of \"Zwei\" for the company's survival horror game \"The Evil Within\", with Mikami directing. The game was released October 2014. It uses a heavily modified external engine although the director wouldn't reveal which one. The game is published by Bethesda on Xbox 360, PS3, PC, PS4 and Xbox One. Mikami stated that this will be the last game he directs. He stated that it will be a \"true\" survival horror game, \"one in which the player confronts and overcomes fear.\" because he was disappointed by recent survival horror games becoming action horror games. In 2019, it was announced at E3 that his studio is working on a new project titled \"\".\n\n"}

RTL 4 is a general entertainment channel with infotainment, television drama, talk shows, game shows, news and talent shows. It is owned by RTL Nederland, a subsidiary of RTL Group. The station has three sister TV channels: RTL 5, RTL 7 and RTL 8, and four thematic TV channels: RTL Z, RTL Lounge, RTL Crime and RTL Telekids.\n\nOfficially RTL 4 - along with RTL 5, RTL 7 and RTL 8 - is headquartered in Hilversum, broadcasting under a Luxembourg TV license. This allows them to avoid more strict control by the Dutch media authorities as Luxembourg's television watchdog is less strict. Despite being intended for Dutch audiences, RTL 4 is encrypted on the Dutch DVB-T Digitenne platform but free-to-air in Luxembourg.\n\nIt originally launched on the Astra 1A satellite as \"RTL Véronique\" on 2 October 1989, before re-branding as RTL 4 the next year. 1, 2 and 3 were already used by the Netherlands' public broadcasters. It was one of the first private commercial broadcaster in the Netherlands. Officially, it still broadcasts from Luxembourg. Private broadcasters were not allowed in the Netherlands until 1992. The encryption system employed by both RTL 4 and 5 analogue services whilst on the Astra 1A and 1C satellites was Luxcrypt. This standard was employed in order to protect the distribution rights sold by foreign studios to RTL. \n\nRTL 4 broadcasts the first and the longest running soap of the Netherlands, \"Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden\" (since 1 October 1990).\n\nRTL 4's latest radical change of programming was on 18 August 2007 when RTL obtained the soccer rights (Eredivisie) but lost the rights to the NOS the following year. In 2008 RTL 4 went back to its roots as a family entertainment channel with programmes such as \"Idols\", \"X Factor\", \"Dancing with the Stars\" and \"Dancing on Ice\". That year RTL 4 also launched \"Ik Hou Van Holland\", a quiz-show around and about the Netherlands with Linda De Mol.\n\nFrom 2009 the talent shows are playing a major role in the programming of RTL 4, the \"X-Factor\" has been rescheduled successfully to Friday night with higher ratings in Season 2 (2009) and Season 3 (2010) on Fridays. In 2010, RTL 4 bought the rights for broadcasting \"Holland's Got Talent\" from SBS 6 and created together with pioneer John De Mol their own talent show \"The Voice of Holland\" in the Autumn of that same year. \"The Voice of Holland\" became a huge hit on Dutch Television with ratings around 3 million viewers every Friday Night. In 2012 yet another new talent show started, \"Beat the Best\".\n\nRTL 4 also owns the rights for the soaps \"As the World Turns\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\". In January 2007, RTL sold the rights for \"B&B\" to SBS6, but bought the rights back in December 2010. With more money and space to buy other TV shows, RTL 4 bought the rights for the first season of the successful drama show \"Brothers & Sisters\" and took over \"\" from sister channel RTL 5.\n\nTelevision host Peter van der Vorst has been appointed Content and Marketing Director of RTL Nederland. He will start on 1 March 2019.\n\nFrom May 1991 until September 2006, the station has had several accompanying radio stations, such as RTL 4 Radio, RTL Radio, RTL Rock Radio, Happy RTL, and RTL FM. Between June 2007 and 1 January 2012 RTL Nederland owned Radio 538, one of the largest radio stations of the Netherlands.\n\nHits on RTL 4 include the RTL Nieuws, Editie NL, RTL Boulevard, Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden and the Saturday night family show Ik hou van Holland. Talent shows are also very popular on RTL 4, such as Idols, X Factor, Holland's Got Talent, Supernanny and The Voice of Holland.

To date, it is his most commercially successful album, it peaked at number 2 on the \"Billboard\" 200 with first-week sales of 226,000 copies and eventually sold over one million copies in the United States, being certified Platinum by the RIAA.\n\nIts two singles were \"Oh Boy\" (featuring Juelz Santana) and \"Hey Ma\" (featuring Juelz Santana, Freekey Zekey, and DJ Kay Slay). \"Oh Boy\" held the number one spot on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles for five straight weeks, the number one spot on the Hot Rap Tracks and peaked at number four on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The second hit was \"Hey Ma\", which reached number three on the Hot 100 and number eight on the UK Singles Chart, becoming his biggest hit. \"Daydreaming\" was a later single released in 2003 but failed to duplicate the success from his earlier singles.\n\nAllMusic's Jason Birchmeier praised Cam's presence throughout the record and Just Blaze supplying him with beats that strengthen him on \"Oh Boy\" and \"The Roc (Just Fire)\", concluding that \"Overall, Cam'ron couldn't return with a stronger comeback album than this: he's affiliated with one of the industry's most successful labels, graced with a hot producer, and armed with a dynamite single.\" Steve 'Flash' Juon of \"RapReviews\" felt the pairing of Cam with Roc-A-Fella's team of featured artists and producers helped utilize his rap flow to its potential by crafting quality tracks with a \"slamming assembly of b-boy beats\" despite a few duds in \"Live My Life\" and the title track, concluding that \"For the beats though, and for some of Cam'Ron's best rhymes to date, \"Come Home With Me\" will be a summer anthem album for Harlemites and Roc-A-Fella Records ryders alike.\" Jon Caramanica, writing for \"Rolling Stone\", commended Cam's unique lyrical abilities but felt the stories he delivered about drugs and women were half-hearted and lacked charisma, and only partially worked when the production gave them \"the substance and emotional center they otherwise lack.\"\n"}

The game dates at least to the 18th century, being first mentioned by the English authoress, Frances Burney, and probably derives from a more ancient drinking and gambling game. References to \"Snip, snap, snorum\", which seems to be the original spelling, go back to at least 1823.\n\n\"Snip, snap, snorum\" is recorded as early as 1767 in England in a way that suggests the game would have been well known and appears, as \"Chnif Chnof Chnorum\", in 1782 and 1790 in France. Vilmar describes it as a children's game popular in the early 19th century in Germany, the original and proper name of which was \"Schnipp, Schnapp, Schnorum, Apostelorum\" although the last word, which means \"of the apostles\" became corrupted to the meaningless word, \"Basalorum\". Five villages in 19th-century Sweden were named after the Swedish equivalent, \"Snipp, snapp, snorum, hej basalorum\": Snipp, Snapp, Snorum, Hej and Basalorum.\n\nThere are several methods of playing the game, but in the most common a full Whist pack is used and any number of players may take part. The pack is dealt, one card at a time, and the eldest hand places upon the table any card of his choosing. Each player in his turn then tries to match the card played just before his; playing it while saying one of the prescribed words: \"Snip!\", \"Snap!\" or \"Snorem!\" in sequence. Thus, if a King is played, the next player lays down another King (if one is in-hand) calling out \"Snip!\". The next player may lay down the third King if available, saying \"Snap!\", and the next the fourth King with the word \"Snorem!\". A player not being able to pair the card played may not discard, and the holder of snorem has the privilege of beginning the next round. The player who gets rid of all cards in-hand first wins a counter from the other players for each card still held by them. \n\nEarl of Coventry is just the same, but played without counters for a simple win. The leader says \"There's as good a 6 can be\" (if they had played a six). The second player says \"There's a 6 as good as he\", the third \"There's the best of all the three\", and the fourth \"And there's the Earl of Coventry\". Optionally, players may be required to make a different rhyming statement every time they play a fourth card.\n\nA related game called Jig is somewhat a cross between Snip-Snap and Stops, in that the aim of succeeding players is not to match rank but to play the next higher card of the same suit, from Ace low to King high. \n\nThe leader plays any card and says \"Snip\", and the next four able to continue the sequence announce respectively \"Snap\", \"Snorum\", \"Hicockalorum\", \"Jig\". The last turns down the five-card sequence and starts a new one. When a sequence cannot be continued because the last card was a King or the next card has been played out, the last player says \"Jig\" regardless of position, and leads to the next round. As before, the first out of cards receives 1 counter for each card left in other players' hands.\nAn extended version called \"Schnipp Schnapp Schnurr Burr Basilorum\" is played in Germany. Kings are not stops but are followed by Ace, Two, etc.\nThe rules are recorded as early as 1868 in the Electorate of Hesse under their original name of \"Schnipp Schnapp Schnurr Apostolorum\", the last word \"also being abbreviated to \"Bostelorum\" or \"Bastelorum\"\" and, later, \"Baselorum\". In the variant described by Vilmar, players must lead either with a Seven or a Jack. He goes on to explains that the original meaning was to imply a game being played between the Four Apostles or Evangelists, but that its corruption to \"Baselorum\" by another author diminished its potential irreverence.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2137425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2137425", "title": "Steve Collins", "text": "Steve Collins\n\nStephen Collins (born 21 July 1964) is an Irish former professional boxer who competed from 1986 to 1997. Known as \"The Celtic Warrior\", Collins is the most successful Irish boxer in recent professional boxing history, having held the WBO middleweight and super-middleweight titles, and never losing a fight as champion.\n\nCollins' first nineteen professional fights all took place in the United States. In 1988 he won the Irish middleweight title, and the regional American USBA middleweight title the following year, defending the latter successfully in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. In his first two world championship challenges, both for the WBA middleweight title, Collins lost a unanimous decision to Mike McCallum in 1990 and a majority decision to Reggie Johnson in 1992. He also challenged unsuccessfully for the European middleweight title later in 1992, losing a split decision to Sumbu Kalambay in Italy.\n\nIt was not until Collins reached his early 30s that he fulfilled his potential, becoming WBO middleweight champion in his third world title attempt with a fifth-round TKO victory over Chris Pyatt in 1994, before then moving up in weight to defeat the undefeated Chris Eubank and claim the WBO super-middleweight title in 1995. More success followed, as Collins successfully defended his title by winning the rematch against Eubank later in the year. Collins successfully defended his title another six times before pulling out of a proposed fight in October 1997 against rising Welsh star, Joe Calzaghe, and retiring from the sport, with Collins frustrated by his inability to get a fight against the pound for pound number one boxer of the time, Roy Jones Jr., who was then fighting in the light-heavyweight division.\n\nHaving competed against some of the best boxers on both sides of the Atlantic during his career, Collins tends to be linked more to an era in the UK during which there was a notable rivalry between British boxers Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn, both of whom Collins fought and defeated twice.\n\nSteve Collins won 26 Irish titles as an amateur before turning professional in Massachusetts, US in October 1986. Collins worked out of the Petronelli Brothers gym in Brockton, Massachusetts alongside Marvin Hagler. His debut fight was against Julio Mercado on the undercard of a bill that featured Irish Americans; his future trainer Freddie Roach and the future Fight of the Year winner Micky Ward. Collins beat Mercado by way of knockout in the third round.\n\nIn Boston, Massachusetts in 1988, he defeated former Olympian and British Super Middleweight champion Sam Storey to win the Irish middleweight title, then defeated world No. 5, Kevin Watts to win the USBA middleweight title. After reaching 16–0, Collins stepped in as a substitute in a WBA middleweight title fight after Michael Watson was injured in training, and fought 12 rounds against Mike McCallum in Boston in 1990. Collins was supported by a large crowd of Irish Americans as he battled the champion McCallum, with the fight being close early on before McCallum started to tire as Collins gained momentum in the later stages to bring a close finish at the end of 12 exciting rounds. McCallum got the win by unanimous decision.\n\nIn 1992, Collins lost a majority decision to Reggie Johnson in a closely contested slugfest for the vacant WBA middleweight title (which had been stripped from McCallum because he signed to fight IBF champion James Toney). Collins then lost by split decision to Sumbu Kalambay for the European title in Italy, before beating Gerhard Botes of South Africa to win the WBA Penta-Continental middleweight title in 1993.\n\nCollins then moved to Belfast under the management of Barney Eastwood before basing himself in England where he joined Barry Hearn's Matchroom Boxing. Alongside him was Paul \"Silky\" Jones, his sparring partner and good friend who later went on to become WBO light-middleweight title holder. Collins was trained by Freddie King in the Romford training camp.\n\nIn May 1994, Collins finally won a world title by defeating Chris Pyatt by stoppage in five rounds to become the WBO middleweight champion. Early in 1995, Collins relinquished this title without a defence as he was having difficulty making the 160lbs middleweight limit. \n\nIn March 1995, Chris Eubank (41-0-2) had been scheduled to have a third WBO super-middleweight title fight against Ray Close. Eubank and Close had two fights over the previous two years (their first fight a draw, and their second fight a narrow split decision win for Eubank), but Close was forced to withdraw from their scheduled third fight after failing an MRI brain scan. Collins then stepped into Close's place, moving up to super-middleweight to take on Eubank.\n\nCollins defeated the then unbeaten long-reigning champion Chris Eubank in Millstreet, County Cork, Ireland, in March 1995, by unanimous decision (115–111, 116–114, 114–113), to win the WBO super-middleweight title. Collins had enlisted the help of a guru, and they led the press to believe that Collins would be hypnotised for the fight, which noticeably unsettled Eubank. True to form, Collins sat in his corner and did not move, listening to headphones during Eubank's ring entrance. Collins knocked Eubank down in the eighth round, and was well ahead on the scorecards at the end of Round 9, but Eubank finished the fight strongly as he tried to save his unbeaten record and knocked Collins down in the tenth round, coming close to a stoppage. Eubank was unable to finish the job, and Collins held on for victory.\n\nIn their September 1995 rematch in Cork, Collins performed brilliantly, changing his usual fighting style by adopting wild, brawling tactics throughout which Eubank really struggled to deal with. Despite most TV pundits and commentators giving Collins a wide points victory with scorecards in the region of 117–111 and 118–110, the three judges saw the fight very differently with Collins only winning by a close split decision, 115–113, 115–113 and 114–115. Collins successfully defended his WBO super-middleweight title seven times, including two fights against Nigel Benn in 1996.\n\nIn the summer of 1997, Collins reportedly stated in the press that he had no motivation left, as he had spent the best part of his career chasing Roy Jones Jr. for a fight that had been promised to him many times. Collins is reported to have stated in Boxing World that he had spent so long chasing Roy Jones Jr. that money was no longer important; that he would \"fight him in a phone box in front of two men and a dog\". but the bout never materialised. A WBO super-middleweight title fight against Joe Calzaghe was agreed for October 1997, but Collins got injured 10 days before the scheduled fight, got stripped of his title by the WBO, with Collins then making a statement saying that fighting Calzaghe would do nothing to satisfy the desire he had for fighting Jones. Collins then added he wanted to retire on a high note with a good pay day, \"Joe is a good up-and-coming kid, but he wouldn't fill a parish church\". As Collins couldn't get the fight with Jones, Collins decided to retire.\n\nIn 1999, Collins announced his decision to come out of retirement to fight Roy Jones Jr. Controversy surrounded the proposed fight, as WBC and WBA light heavyweight champion Jones decided to fight the IBF light heavyweight champion and old Collins foe Reggie Johnson (which Jones won by a shutout 120–106 on all three judges' scorecards), and it was revealed that Collins would have to fight Calzaghe before a showdown with Jones. Collins had accepted this and started to prepare to fight Calzaghe. In training, Collins collapsed during a sparring session with Howard Eastman. Although tests and a brain scan could not find any problems, Collins decided that it was a warning to make him stop boxing, and he retired for a second time.\n\nCollins retired in 1997, with a record of 39 fights, 36 wins (21 knockouts) and 3 losses.\n\nCollins has not entirely faded from the spotlight since his retirement. In 1998 he appeared in the film \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" as a boxing gym bouncer. In 1999 he made a cameo appearance in \"Sweetest Thing\", a music video by U2. On 15 January 2013, at the age of 48, Collins announced plans to fight his longtime nemesis Roy Jones Jr. He went on to appear in a number of exhibition bouts in preparation for the proposed Jones fight.\n\nIn 2017 Collins joined the Army Reserve's 253 Provost Company of the 4th Regiment Royal Military Police in London where he had been living for the previous 20 years. He gained promotion to Lance Corporal and qualified as an army boxing coach. He is reputed to be much harder than L/Cpl. Blackburn.\n\nHis brother Roddy Collins is a former professional footballer and now manager.\n\n"}

As a public system, the CBE is required to accept any students who meet age and residency requirements, regardless of religion. It was founded in 1885 as the Calgary Protestant Public School District No. 19.\n\nIn terms of student population and school count, the CBE is the largest school board in Alberta, and over twice the size of the other major school district board in Calgary, the Calgary Catholic School District (CCSD), which teaches mainly, but not exclusively, Catholic students. The other two districts based in the city, both Francophone, are a fraction of the size of the CBE with only a handful of schools each. In land area, the CBE is the smallest of the four Calgary districts, as its territory is limited to municipal limits of Calgary (although its area is only slightly smaller than that of the CCSD). As the city limits have expanded, the CBE boundary has remained in sync. All CBE land overlaps the other three districts.\n\nThe CBE operates 226 schools in grades K-12. Non-adult student enrollment was 111,518, there is an additional enrollment of 2,982 for continuing education which is CBE-Learn and Chinook Learning. A total Enrollment of 114,472 in Sept 2014. The operating budget was $1.3 billion for the 2015/16 fiscal year.\n\nA group of seven elected trustees govern the CBE. Each trustee represents two wards in the city. They are elected every four years, in the regular municipal election. In the election, Calgary voters can only vote for a trustee to one (not both) of the two main school boards. The last election was in October 2013. The public (CBE) and Catholic (CCSD) systems operate independently of each other, and are both under the direct authority of the provincial government of Alberta.\n\nLong serving Trustee and Chair of the Board, Pat Cochrane declined to run in the 2013 municipal elections. Cochrane was first elected in 1999 and has devoted much effort and time to the causes of Public Education. Fellow trustee George Lane was defeated by a wide margin in Wards 6 & 7.\n\nThe CBE operates a number of special programs, usually, but not always operated out of regular schools (with regular instruction).\n\nThe CBE operates an adult and continuing education program through Chinook Learning Services. It offers High School Upgrading, Continuing Education and adult English as a Second Language (ESL) programs.\n\nThe Louise Dean Centre is a school specifically designed for female students that become pregnant before completing high school. It provides daycare for the children, flexible schedules for the students, and special counseling.\n\nThe CBE's Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program assists qualified students with more advanced instruction. GATE compacts and accelerates the typical curriculum. It also provides extra experts and mentors. Currently, nine CBE schools offer the GATE program.\n\nIn 2003, the CBE opened the board's only all-female school, Alice Jamieson Girls' Academy. In the same year, over the board's objections, the Calgary Girls' School (CGS) public charter school was also opened; but as a charter school, CGS is run independently of the CBE. Both schools teach grades 4-9, and are founded on the premise that females learn differently from boys, and will under-perform for social reasons when in the presence of male peers.\n\nIn 2011, the CBE opened the board's first all-male alternative program, based in the Sir James Lougheed School. The program teaches grades K-5, and similar to the all-girls schools - the program is founded on the premise that boys learn differently from girls, and they may behave differently in order to meet \"macho\" expectations, and that they require a more active, hands-on teaching style.\n\nThe board also operates a French immersion program in a limited number of schools. The program is geared mainly for English-speaking families who wish their children to become fully fluent in French. It offers early and late adoption programs.\n\nUp until 2000, the CBE also provided French instruction (as the primary language of instruction) to children from French families (who didn't need or want immersion). When the Greater Southern Francophone School Board was formed in 2000, the CBE relinquished its authority over such schools, and handed over (what was then known as) Ecole Queen's Park (its only such school at the time) to the Francophone board.\n\nIn Alberta, a senior high school teaches grades 10-12. However, some may not teach all three grades. Also, some are combined with junior high schools, which teach grades 7-9. The following is a list of senior high schools operated by the CBE as of 2005, taken from the CBE's complete list. The board divides the city into five areas.\n\nThe CBE, in 2010, launched the CBE Chief Superintendent's Student Advisory Council - a group of high school students with student representation from each of the CBE's high school programs. They meet regularly with the CBE's Chief Superintendent, David Stevenson, to discuss issues in the system and propose solutions.\n\nRideau Park School first opened in 1930.\n\n\n\n"}

Nicknamed \"Red Haired Devil\", he ranks 21st among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nA native of Dongluzhou (東潞州; believed to be present-day Changzhi, Shanxi), Liu Tang is muscular and dark-complexioned. He is nicknamed \"Red Haired Devil\" because his hair is of a crimson hue and his broad face bears a prominent red birthmark. A skilled fighter, he specialises in the use of pudao. With no fixed abode, he mainly does illegal trading in Shandong and Hebei.\n\nLiu Tang gets wind of the conveyance of valuables to the Grand Tutor Cai Jing in the imperial capital Dongjing from Daming. They are birthday gift from Cai's son-in-law Grand Secretary Liang Shijie, the prefect of Daming. Liu rushes to Dongxi village in Yuncheng County to suggest to Chao Gai, the village's headman who is well-known for chivalry, that they together hijack the valuables. Before he reaches Chao's home, he gets drunk and falls asleep in a rundown temple in the village.\n\nLei Heng, a chief constable of Yuncheng, comes to the temple that night while on patrol with his men. Lei is certain that Liu, with his odd and vagabond looks, is up to no good in the village. They pounce on him and tie him up before he could resist. They then stop by at Chao Gai's manor for some refreshment. Out of curiosity, Chao secretly goes to check on Liu, who is suspended in a side room. Liu tells Chao the purpose of his visit. Chao Gai then lies to Lei Heng that Liu Tang is his nephew, thus winning his release. However, feeling sore over the arrest, Liu catches up with Lei Heng as he returns to office and challenges him to a fight. Chao Gai comes to the scene and stops the clash.\n\nThe hijack team eventually comprises seven men, namely Chai Gai, Wu Yong, Gongsun Sheng, Liu Tang and the three Ruan brothers. Disguised as date traders and with the help of Bai Sheng, who imposes as a wine seller, they trick the escort party led by Yang Zhi to take the drugged wine of Bai. When the escorts fall over numb in their limbs, the seven men cart away the valuables. \n\nBut authorities soon track down essential clues and send soldiers to seize Chao Gai at his house. Song Jiang, a clerk of Yuncheng's magistrate, learns of the arrest order and rushes to alert Chao to flee. After beating their pursuers, Chao leads his gang to join the outlaw stronghold at Liangshan Marsh. \n\nWorried that Chao Gai would usurp his position, Wang Lun, the chief of Liangshan, tries to send the group away with gifts and excuses. Wu Yong instigates Lin Chong, who has been cold-shouldered by Wang since joining the stronghold, to kill the chief. Chao Gai is then elected the new chief of Liangshan, with Liu Tang taking the fifth position. \n\nChao Gai sends Liu Tang to take some gold pieces and a letter to Song Jiang to convey his gratitude. Song is shocked when Liu, whose wanted notice bearing his picture is widely posted in the region, greets him openly one night on the street. Besides, Liu could be easily identified by the prominent birthmark on his face. Nevertheless, Song takes Liu to a quiet inn where he accepts only one piece of gold and the letter. It is this letter which later leads to Song killing his mistress Yan Poxi, who threatens to report his link to the outlaws to the authorities. The incident starts Song on the way to become a bandit.\n\nWhen the Liangshan outlaws attack Dongchang Prefecture (東昌府; in present-day Liaocheng, Shandong) for food, they come up against the garrison commander Zhang Qing, who flings stones with great accuracy. Zhang fells many Liangshan warriors from horseback with his stones. Liu Tang, seeing that mounted combat is getting nowhere, charges at Zhang on foot. But he is captured when Zhang knocks him down with a stone. He is freed after the outlaws overran Dongchang.\n\nLiu Tang is appointed as one of the infantry leaders of Liangshan after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan.\n\nIn the battle of Hangzhou in the campaign against Fang La, Liu Tang meets his end when, eager to score merit, he charges into the city upon noticing the gate is open. A beam is dropped on him when he gets past the gate, crushing him to death. He is later awarded the posthumous title \"Martial Gentleman of Loyalty\" (忠武郎).\n\n"}

It was designated a National Historic Landmark on January 29, 1964, for its architecture as a well-preserved 19th-century tavern, and for its role in the early settlement by white men of northeastern Georgia.\n\nTravelers Rest is about 6 miles (10 km) east of Toccoa, Georgia, near the Tugaloo River, on Riverdale Road just north of United States Route 123. It was built upon Cherokee land close to the former Cherokee town of Tugaloo granted to Major Jesse Walton in 1785. Walton, a Revolutionary War soldier and political leader, was killed by Indians near here in 1789. The Walton family sold the land to James Rutherford Wyly who built the main part of the house between 1816 and 1825. Wyly opened the house as an inn for travelers on the newly constructed Unicoi Turnpike. Devereaux Jarrett bought the house on August 21, 1838 and it became the headquarters of his plantation. Jarrett added to the original structure and opened it to the public. Due to the growing population and increased through traffic, the structure served as an inn, trading post, and post office. While the ten room house was open to the public it entertained many illustrious travelers. The Jarrett account books that doubled as hotel registers contain the name of the English scientist and author, George William Featherstonhaugh. \n\nThe main building is a large and rambling two story wood frame structure, more than long. It is built out of wide pine planking and has six chimneys. One of the fireplaces has a mantle with drawers for storage of valuables. The front porch has seven rooms on each level with separate entrances, and an inside staircase providing access to the second floor. The rear of the house is where the innkeeper's family lived, with public rooms (dining room and parlor areas) in between. The post office was located on the second floor. The property includes, in addition to the main building, recreations of typical outbuildings of the 19th century, including slave quarters. It remained in the hands of Jarrett's descendants until 1955, when it was acquired by the state. Today, visitors can tour the house and see many original artifacts and furnishings, some of which were crafted by Caleb Shaw, a renowned cabinetmaker from Massachusetts.\n\n\n"}

He is not one of the 108 Stars of Destiny because he dies before the Grand Assembly of the 108 Stars. However, after his death, he serves as a spiritual guardian of the outlaws, who from time to time dedicate ceremonial sacrifices to him.\n\nChao Gai earned his nickname \"Pagoda-Shifting Heavenly King\" after carrying a pagoda miniature from the west side of a creek to the east, where his village stood, to deter malevolent spirits. His fellows commonly refer to him as \"Heavenly King Chao\" (). Born in a wealthy family, he serves as the \"baozheng\" (保正; a chief of a village with 500 households) of Dongxi Village (東溪村; \"Eastern Creek Village\") in Yuncheng County, Shandong. Apart from having a wide network of friends and acquaintances throughout the \"jianghu\", he also maintains close friendships with the local chief constables Zhu Tong and Lei Heng.\n\nWhen Chao Gai's friend Liu Tang receives news that a convoy escorting some birthday gifts for the Imperial Tutor Cai Jing will be passing by Dongxi Village, he wants to rob the convoy and plans to get Chao Gai to help him. During his journey to Dongxi Village, he gets drunk and falls asleep in a rundown temple. Lei Heng, who passes by the temple, suspects that Liu Tang is a fugitive so he arrests him. Along the way back to the county office, Lei Heng decides to visit Chao Gai and take a break at Dongxi Village. While Lei Heng is enjoying the village's hospitality, Chao Gai surreptitiously meets Liu Tang and finds out what happened. He then lies to Lei Heng that Liu Tang is a distant relative and gets Lei Heng to release Liu Tang.\n\nChao Gai forms a team of seven to rob the convoy. They disguise themselves as date traders and, with Bai Sheng's help, trick the escorts into consuming wine spiked with drugs that will make them unconscious. Once the unsuspecting escorts are knocked out, Chao Gai and his friends escape with the birthday gifts. After the incident, the authorities order the constable He Tao to track down and arrest the robbers. Bai Sheng carelessly reveals his role in the robbery and ends up being arrested. Despite being tortured, Bai Sheng refuses to name his accomplices even though He Tao already knows that Chao Gai is one of them.\n\nSong Jiang secretly warns Chao Gai and his friends that they are wanted by the authorities, and advises them to flee immediately. In the meantime, the local magistrate assigns Zhu Tong and Lei Heng to lead soldiers to arrest Chao Gai and his friends. However, after considering their friendship with Chao Gai, the two chief constables secretly help him and his friends escape.\n\nAfter defeating the soldiers sent to arrest them, Chao Gai and his friends retreat to Liangshan Marsh and join the outlaw band there. Wang Lun, the outlaw chief, feels that Chao Gai and his friends pose a threat to him so he tries to send them away with gifts and excuses. During this time, Wu Yong instigates Lin Chong, who is already unhappy with Wang Lun, to kill Wang Lun. Chao Gai then becomes the new chief of the Liangshan outlaw band.\n\nThroughout his tenure as Liangshan's chief, Chao Gai hardly participates in battles against Liangshan's enemies. For the most part, he lets Song Jiang lead Liangshan forces into battle while he remains behind to guard their base and provide reinforcements.\n\nOn one occasion, the Zeng brothers of the Zeng Family Fortress rob a precious steed from Duan Jingzhu, who originally intended to present it as a gift to Chao Gai. The Zengs have all along been hostile towards Liangshan and have put up slogans around their fortress to insult Liangshan's leaders. After the Zengs ambushed and injured Liu Tang for no apparent reason, Chao Gai can no longer stand their provocations and decides to personally lead Liangshan forces to attack the fortress and teach the Zengs a lesson.\n\nDuring a battle against the Zeng forces, Chao Gai gets hit in the forehead by an arrow coated with poison. The arrow was fired by Shi Wengong, the martial arts instructor in the fortress. Chao Gai dies of poisoning shortly afterwards. Before his death, he says: \"Whoever captures Shi Wengong and avenges me shall become the next chief of Liangshan\". Although Lu Junyi turns out to be the one who defeats and captures Shi Wengong, Song Jiang ultimately succeeds Chao Gai as Liangshan's chief when Lu Junyi and the other outlaw chieftains insist that Song Jiang be their leader.\n\nChao Gai's character is entirely consistent with the ideas presented in the Liangshan outlaws' manifesto: \"delivering justice on Heaven's behalf\". His personal history as an official-turned-outlaw also portends the Liangshan way of life and their subsequent methods of recruiting members who previously served in the government.\n\n\n"}

Taking an interest in art, he made several educational journeys, travelling to Munich, Dresden and Berlin, and spent some months in Italy. After his Ph.D. he addressed himself to art history. He wrote a second Ph.D. thesis on Hegel's theory of history in Tübingen, where he also was involved in the political activities of the Revolution of 1848.\n\nHe settled at Tübingen, but in 1848 returned to Prague and began to lecture at the university on the history of the revolutionary epoch. The liberal tone of these lectures brought him into disfavour with the ruling authorities, and in 1849 he left Bohemia and passed some time in England, France and the Netherlands. In 1852 he settled at Bonn, where he was lecturer and professor (from 1860) for art history. In 1872 he went to the University of Strasbourg, and in 1873 to Leipzig University, where he became Professor for Medieval and Modern Art at the newly founded Institute for Art History.\n\nAs a journalist and a publicist Springer advocated the federal union of the states ruled by the Austrian emperor, and asserted the right of Prussia to the headship of Germany; during the Crimean War he favored the emancipation of the small states in southeast Europe from Turkish supremacy. After many years of feeble health, he died at Leipzig on 31 May 1891.\n\nA fiery personality, he disparaged the art historian Herman Grimm, whom, according to Kessler, he attacked from the lectern as a writer of dime novels for wealthy readers. Likewise he berated the art historian Hermann Knackfuß as \"Hermann Knackwurst.\" Jacob Burckhardt, fully cognizant of Springer's enmity toward him, reportedly gave Springer's student Gustav Pauli a rough reception when Pauli applied to study under him in Basel.\n\nSpringer played an important role in establishing art history as an academic subject. He rejected the more literary or impressionistic approaches of his colleagues like Herman Grimm or Hermann Knackfuß. Among his own works are several treatises on occidental art: a \"Compendium on the Architecture of the Christian Middle Ages\" (1854), a \"Handbook on Art History\" (1855), a \"History of Fine Arts in the 19th Century\" (1858), \"Iconographical Studies\" (1860), a work on \"Contemporary Fine Arts\" (1875), books on Raphael and Michelangelo (1878) and (posthumously) a book on Albrecht Dürer (1892).\n\nHis historical works include his \"Geschichte Österreichs seit dem Wiener Frieden\" (Leipzig, 1863–1865), which was translated into Czech (Prague, 1867), as well as: \"Geschichte des Revolutionszeitalters\" (Prague, 1849); \"Österreich nach der Revolution\" (Prague, 1850); \"Österreich, Preussen und Deutschland\" (Prague, 1851); \"Paris im 18. Jahrhundert\" (Leipzig, 1856); and \"Protokolle des Verfassungs-Ausschusses im Oesterreichischen Reichstage 1848–1849\" (Leipzig, 1885).\n\nHis principal works on art are: \"Leitfaden der Baukunst des christlichen Mittelalters\" (Bonn, 1854); the valuable \"Handbuch der Kunstgeschichte\" (7th ed., Leipzig, 1906), a revised edition of his \"Grundzüge der Kunstgeschichte\" (Leipzig, 1887–1888); \"Geschichte der bildenden Künste im 14. Jahrhundert\" (Leipzig, 1858); \"Bilder aus der neueren Kunstgeschichte\" (Bonn 1867, and again 1886); \"Raffael und Michelangelo\" (Leipzig, 1877 and 1885); and \"Die Kunst des 14. Jahrhunderts\" (Leipzig 1880–1881). Springer wrote two biographies: \"Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann\" (Leipzig, 1870–1872), and \"Albrecht Dürer\" (Berlin, 1892); and was responsible for the German edition of Crowe and Cavalcaselle's \"Lives of the Early Flemish Painters\", which was published at Leipzig in 1875. His book of reminiscences, \"Aus meinem Leben\" (Berlin, 1892), containing contributions by Gustav Freytag and Hubert Janitschek, was edited by his son Jaro Springer (born 1856), who is also known as a writer on art.\n\n"}

In January, Terri claimed to have suffered a miscarriage after she was knocked off of the ring apron by Brown. The guilty Brown became a servant to PMS, who forced him to wrestle his friend, Mark Henry. The deception lasted until February 1, when the ringside doctor told Brown that Terri had not been pregnant. PMS then feuded with Brown by costing him matches and attacking his new manager, Ivory. Jacqueline returned to the women's division in March, and on the April 12 episode of \"Raw Is War\", she, Ivory, Tori, and Sable took part in a four way match for the Women's Championship.

Also, they would force him to do their bidding and wear wrestling tights that resembled a pair of tight underwear. After Shamrock left the WWF, Terri and Jacqueline continued to assist Meat in his matches.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nValencia attained its city status after the ratification of Republic Act No. 8985 on January 12, 2001. The city is the most populous among all cities and municipalities, and the 6th largest in terms of area in the province of Bukidnon. It is also the most populous inland/landlocked city in Mindanao. It is the third largest city in Northern Mindanao in terms of population, after Cagayan de Oro and Iligan City respectively. The city serves as the center of trade and commerce in the province of Bukidnon.\n\nThe territory that now comprises the city of Valencia is combined from thirteen Barangays of the City of Malaybalay, Bukidnon.\n\nThe earliest inhabitants in the area, presently comprising part of the Poblacion, were Bukidnon natives who founded a settlement along the banks of Pulangi River and the confluence of the dumanggas River. The pioneers were led by Darwin Dumanggas Manangkila together with the families of the Binalhays, Laugas, Dongogans, Gua-ans, Lanayans, and the Arenzos. The first site of the settlement was a sitio named \"“Panglibatuhan”\" because the area was thickly forested by tree species called by the natives as “Malibato trees”.\n\nIn 1911, a one-room barrio school was opened, and its first teacher was the late Leon Galorport. The school site is approximately the present location of the \"Poblacion Barangay High School\". Galorport, who came from his hometown, Valencia, Bohol named the school \"“Valencia School”\". When the sitio became a barrio of Malaybalay, the resident agreed to name it “Valencia”. Finally, when the southern portion of Malaybalay was separated as a new municipality, the petitioners agreed to name the municipality as “Valencia”. The barrio which was Valencia is now Barangay Poblacion and is the seat of the city government of Valencia.\n\nThe rich natural resources found in the territory eventually attracted Christian settlers from the highly populated coastal areas of Mindanao, Visayas and Luzon islands.\n\nThe prime mover in the creation of Valencia as a municipality was Teodoro Pepito, who spearheaded a petition by the residents of barrio Valencia and neighboring barrios to convert the territory into a full-fledged municipality. The petition was forwarded to the Provincial Board of the Bukidnon province for consideration. The Provincial Board passed a resolution approving the creation of the Municipality of Valencia and forwarded the same to the Office of the President of the Philippines.\n\nBy virtue of the provisions of \"Executive Order No. 360\", the municipality of Valencia was formally born on January 16, 1961. The barrios of Bagontaas, Cawayanon (Vintar), Guinoyuran, Laligan, Lilingayon, Lumbayao, Lurugan, Maapag, Mailag, San Isidro, Sugod, Tongantongan, and Valencia were separated from then Municipality of Malaybalay to form the Municipality of Valencia. In 1961, President Carlos P. Garcia appointed Teodoro Pepito and Ernesto Garcia as the mayor and vice mayor respectively. Upon the election of President Diosdado Macapagal in November 1961, another set of municipal officials were appointed, with Lucilo Alkuino as municipal mayor and Solomon Gao-ay as vice mayor. Thus, between 1962 and 1963, two sets of municipal officials have served the municipality of Valencia. Later on, some sitios of the original barrios became regular barangays, resulting to the present 31 barangays of Valencia City.\n\nDuring the regular local election in November 1963, Pepito won and became the first elected mayor, with Ernesto Garcia as the vice mayor. Mayor Pepito was re-elected in 1967 and again in 1971. However, before his term expired in 1975, martial law was declared by President Ferdinand Marcos in 1972 and elections for local officials were suspended. Mayor Pepito continued to hold office as mayor until 1978, when he retired from government service. The vice mayor, Absalon Catarata, succeeded as municipal mayor until 1979, when President Ferdinand Marcos appointed Santiago Dablio as acting mayor of Valencia.\n\nIn 1980 local elections, Absalon Catarata was elected municipal mayor, with Romulo Makalood as vice mayor together with all the councilors in the opposition ticket. In February 1986, the People Power Revolution in Manila took place and Corazon Aquino became the President of the Republic.\n\nDuring the campaign for the approval of the new constitution, the municipal government under the leadership of Absalon Catarata wholeheartedly supported it. In January 1988, Catarata was re-elected as mayor and his running mate, Berthobal Ancheta was elected as vice mayor together with seven councilors under his party. Months later, he was elected president of the Bukidnon Mayors League and similarly as president of the Mayor's League of Region X.\n\nOn the evening of April 21, 1988, Absalon Catarata was fatally shot by an unknown assassin in front of his residence while waiting for his service vehicle which would have fetched him to an evening program at the town plaza. After his death, Vice Mayor Berthobal Ancheta became the municipal mayor, and Afrodisia Catarata, the wife of then Mayor, was appointed member of the Sangguniang Bayan. In the synchronized elections of 1990, Mayor Berthobal Ancheta was re-elected while Afrodisia Catarata was elected as vice mayor up to June 2001.\n\nBy virtue of \"Republic Act 8985\", an act converting the municipality of Valencia in the province of Bukidnon into a component City known as the City of Valencia on January 12, 2001. In 2001 elections, Jose Galario, Jr., former Chief of Police of the City was elected as City Mayor; while the son of then Mayor, Absalon Catarata and former Vice Mayor Afrodisia Catarata was also elected as the city's vice mayor in the person of Leandro Jose Catarata. During the 2004 local elections, both the incumbent mayor and vice mayor run for the position of city mayor. Jose Galario, Jr. emerged as the winning candidate together with Benjamin Verano as vice mayor.\n\nIn the 2007 elections, incumbent Mayor Jose Galario, Jr. lost to his rival, Leandro Jose Catarata for city mayor. Benjamin Verano was re-elected as vice mayor of the city. In the 2010 general elections, incumbent Leandro Jose Catarata was reelected for a second term; while Benjamin Verano, Sr., Catarata's running mate, won the vice mayoralty position of the City of Valencia. However early in 2010, Verano died at office and was replaced by Azucena Huervas, the president of Valencia's Association of Barangay Captains.\n\nOn June 9, 2014, Vice Mayor Azucena Huervas assumed the mayorship of the city after the conviction of Mayor Galario for violating the Anti-graft and Corrupt practices Act (RA 3019) in relation to his order transferring Ruth P. Piano from Budget Office to a non-existing office of City Liaison Officer.\n\nMay 9, 2016 Elections, Mayor Azucena P. Huervas was elected by the people of Valencia against her rivals, Amie G. Galario, Renato Centillas, and Leandro Jose H. Catarata.\n\nValencia City is located in the central part of the Province of Bukidnon. It is bounded on the north by the municipality of Lantapan and Malaybalay City; on the east by the municipality of San Fernando; on the west and southwest by the municipalities of Pangantucan and Talakag; and on the south by the municipalities of Maramag and Quezon.\n\nFrom its core, which is the Poblacion, the city is 27 kilometers from the provincial capital of Malaybalay City and 118 kilometers from the regional center of Cagayan de Oro City. The means of transportation is by bus and private vehicles and covers approximately two to three hours ride.\n\nThe relative distance of the barangay from the city proper varies: four barangays are more or less 5 kilometers away, 20 barangays are 6 - 15 kilometers away, while the remaining 7 barangays considered as the most interior, are situated 16 kilometers or more from the city proper.\n\nThere are no seaports in the city because the place is landlocked. The nearest airports and seaports are in Cagayan de Oro City and Davao City.\n\nThe city's topography is characterized as flat to undulating hills with extensive plateaus and mountainous areas and cliffs on both eastern and western portions bounding the municipality of San Fernando on the east and the municipality of Talakag on the west. Its highest point is Mount Kalatungan in the Kalatungan Mountain Range rising above 1,000 meters and above 50 percent slopes. These cover 25.72 percent of the total city area and major portions of Barangay of Lourdes, Guinoyuran and Lilingayon.\n\nThe City's average elevation is 300 meters above sea level. Elevation above 1,000 meters has a bigger area coverage with 28.93 percent of the total city area or 18,262.79 hectares. While elevation below 300 meters covers only 7.0 percent of total city area or 4,419.78 hectares. Elevation ranges from 300–500 meters covers an area of 27,591.10 hectares or 43.70 percent of the total city area. 500–1,000 meter elevation covers an area of 18,262.79 hectares or 28.93 percent of total city area.\n\nThe area distribution of slope of the city are categorized into: level to gently sloping having a slope range of 0-3 percent covering an area of 6,962.53 hectares or 11.02 percent of the total city area; gently sloping to undulating having a slope range of 3-8 percent covering an area of 18,914.79 hectares or 29.96 percent of total city area; undulating to rolling having a slope range of 8-18 percent covering an area of 3,646.33 hectares or 5.78 percent of the total city area; rolling to hilly having a slope range of 18-30 percent with an area coverage of 11,306.28 hectares or 17.92 percent of the total city area; steep hills to mountainous having a slope of 30-50 percent with area coverage of 6,062.53 hectares or 9.60 percent of the total City area and; cliff-like streamline having a slope range of 50 percent above covering an area of 16,233.54 hectares or 25.72 percent of the total area.\n\nValencia City is underlain by three distinct geologic formations. Volcanic rocks believed to be of pliocene-quaternary age underlie the areas west of Pulangi River. The areas east of the broad plains in Valencia City are underlain by stratified sequence of clastic sedimentary rocks and limestone. Alluvial deposits are unconsolidated detrital materials transformed from higher landforms.\n\nThe city generally has clay soil with Adtuyon clay covering 27.89 percent of the total city area suitable for annual cultivated crops and pastures. These are found in all parts of Colonia, Mailag, Bagontaas, Barobo and San Carlos. Maapag clay ranked second with 26.86 percent and covers the whole of San Isidro, Sinayawan, Mabuhay, and Catumbalon and large portions of Vintar, Tongantongan, Maapag and Batangan. Irrigated rice is suitable in these areas. Macolod clay ranked third with 17.51 percent and are generally suited for forest plantation of exotic species. Kidapawan clay loam and undifferentiated mountains soil followed and occupy a combined area of 17.70 percent located within Lilingayon. These areas are also suitable for production forest of native species. Other soil types are San Manuel clay loam (5.31%), La Castellana clay (3.41%), Adtuyon clay stony phase (0.83%), and Mailag clay loam. These types of soil are suitable for annual cultivated crops except for the cliffs along Pulangi River within Poblacion and Lumbo which are not suitable for any land use.\n\nValencia City is politically subdivided into 31 barangays:\n\nPoblacion and its surroundings hold importance in the city, serving as the venue of everyday life in and near the urban center. Due to its large urban population and area, there are informal and unofficial sectors which hold cultural, social, and economic significance to the city. These areas are also referred for transportation means when riding within and from the Poblacion. Some of the sectors/areas in the urban center include:\n\nBalite – a concentration of residences at the northern part of the Poblacion.

Soon-to-open include such stores as NVM Mall-Guinoyuran Road and Robinsons Place Valencia, the second Robinsons Place brand in Northern Mindanao after Iligan. Commercial establishments owned by Maranao, Chinese, and Korean immigrants are also found in the city.\n\nThe city has ample outlets for shopping. Some of the famous known brands include Jollibee, Chowking, Greenwich, McDonald's, Red Ribbon, Goldilocks, 7-Eleven, Penshoppe, Citi Hardware, Rough Rider Jeans, Yamaha, Mitsubishi, Toyota and Honda.\n\nCommercial activities are centered on the Poblacion, particularly at the locally termed \"\"Centro\" (Downtown)\". Several retail stores, banks, and commercial establishments are located in this area of Poblacion. Aside from the \"Centro\" proper, there are some commercial establishments at \"Hagkol\", on the north portion of Poblacion. It is a result of northward urban expansion of the city. Famous motorbike and vehicle retailers, hotels, schools, hospitals and cafes are located at the \"Hagkol\" area.\n\nValencia City has two functional public markets:\n\nOf the 52 banks actively serving region of Bukidnon, 20 banks (about 40% of the province) are located in Valencia City. Nine of the ten largest universal/commercial banks in the country serve the city (except Unionbank). Other banks include Veterans Bank, One Network Bank, Asian United Bank, PSBank, Bukidnon Cooperative Bank, Enterprise Bank, Dumaguete City Development Bank, Rizal Microbank, EastWest Rural Bank, Bank of Makati and Banco Dipolog.\n\nDuring the year 2013, the city had a total generated income of Php 667,728,494. This has continued to surpass 600,000,000 in the following years.\n\nThe city has a total land area of 63,126 hectares. 35,321.74 hectares or 55.95% of this is the total agricultural area that is suitable for crop production. This illustrates that the City is agricultural-based; people depend on much of their source of income through farming, livestock, and poultry. Valencia is nicknamed as the City of Golden Harvest because of its vast rice plains along the barangays north and east of Pulangi River. Valencia's clay-rich, soil which is highly irrigated and favourable to climatic condition, is very conducive for crop production.\n\nThe city is executively administered by the mayor together with vice mayor. The legislative body comprises the members of the Sangguniang Panlungsod which serves as the city council. The mayor is the local chief executive officer of the city and exercises control and supervision over all local administrative offices; while the Sangguniang Panlungsod acts as the legislative body of the city as mandated by the Local Government Code of the Philippines.\n\nMunicipal Mayors from 1961 until 2001:\n\nCity Mayors from 2001 to present:\n\n\nValencia has several tourist destinations and events as tourist attractions:\n\n\n\n\nValencia City is readily accessible by land. There are two functional transport terminals in the city.\n\nJeepneys from nearby municipalities and barangays, and single motorcycles are available at Valencia City Public Transport Terminal (Old Terminal), located at Poblacion. Public utility vehicles in the Old terminal are available for travel to the municipalities of Kadingilan, Kalilangan, Kibawe, Malaybalay City, Maramag, Quezon, San Fernando, and Wao.\n\nBuses from Cagayan de Oro City, General Santos City and Davao City are housed in the Integrated Transportation Terminal Complex located at Barangay Bagontaas, approximately three kilometers north from Poblacion. Pabama Transport, Rural Transit and Tours, and Super 5 serves the city with their regional routes. There are also numerous provincial buses serving the city.\n\nTricycles (locally \"Motorelas)\" and private vehicles facilitate the movement of people and goods to and from all places in the city. Traveling from Poblacion is mainly by land through all kinds of vehicles.\nMajor thoroughfares in the city include Sayre Highway, G. Laviña Avenue (Guinoyuran Road in extension), and Kapalong-Talaingod-Valencia Road.\n\nTraffic in Poblacion has become a serious problem in the city, especially with the major thoroughfares. To reduce congestion of traffic in the city center, Valencia By-pass Road is under construction with its junction in Barangay Mailag. The road will have its other end at Musuan, Maramag, Bukidnon. The City Government also implemented a one-way traffic scheme on the whole stretch of Quezon and Mabini Street. The strict implementation of traffic rules is also observed to promote road safety and order.\n\nCommon traffic choke points, which all intersects Sayre Highway, are the following: Catarata Street junction, G. Laviña Avenue junction, and Batangan Bridge junction (Kapalong-Talaingod-Valencia Road).\n\nValencia has some event centers which allow the city to host many provincial and even regional gatherings, including the Valencia City Gymnasium, SAIT Gymnasium, City Oval Grounds, Bukidnon Football Training Center, CAP Auditorium and many others. It has only one public park, which is the Plaza Rizal.\n\nThe water system of the City is administered by the Valencia City Water District that serves five barangays, namely Poblacion, Lumbo, Bagontaas and Mailag. 29 Barangays enjoy electricity supplied by the First Bukidnon Electric Cooperative. One Barangay enjoys power supply by Bukidnon Second Electric Cooperative.\n\nTelecommuncation services are primarily offered by telephone companies such as Philcom–PLDT and Sotelco, and mobile services by Smart Communications, Globe Telecom, and Sun Cellular. Internet services are also offered by Philcom–PLDT, Smart Communications, and Globe Telecom.\n\n\nValencia City has several colleges:\nSeveral students are enrolled in studies at Central Mindanao University, part of the Municipality of Maramag, approximately 7 kilometers from the city proper.\n\nPrivate primary and secondary schools:\nAlmost every barangay has a public primary school, the largest of which is Valencia City Central School located in Barangay Poblacion. There are other primary secondary schools in the city. However, public secondary education is primarily offered by Valencia National High School, which is also the largest in the city.\n\nFree-to-air television broadcasts are provided by ABS-CBN and GMA Network through their relay broadcast towers located at Mount Kitanglad in nearby Malaybalay City and Myx will transmitter located in the city. Cable television is available through Parasat Cable TV; while satellite cable are primarily provided by Dream Satellite TV and Cignal Digital TV. Radio broadcasts are primarily provided by FM frequency stations such as DXCP-FM, DXWB-FM (Wild FM 92.9 FM), DXEM-FM (Gold FM 96.1), DXRP-FM (Prime FM 94.5), DXBP-FM (Hope Radio 96.9), DXCV-FM (97.7 FM), DXAT-FM (Yes FM 104.1) and Brigada News FM Valencia (Soon to Air); and AM stations such as DXDB-AM (Radyo Totoo 594 AM) (the oldest running radio station in Bukidnon), DXCR AM (1386 AM), and DXMV AM (Radyo Ukay 1134 AM).

In other words, if formula_3 is a prewellordering on a set formula_4, and if we define formula_5 by\nthen formula_5 is an equivalence relation on formula_4, and formula_3 induces a wellordering on the quotient formula_10. The order-type of this induced wellordering is an ordinal, referred to as the length of the prewellordering.\n\nA norm on a set formula_4 is a map from formula_4 into the ordinals. Every norm induces a prewellordering; if formula_13 is a norm, the associated prewellordering is given by\nConversely, every prewellordering is induced by a unique regular norm (a norm formula_13 is regular if, for any formula_16 and any formula_17, there is formula_18 such that formula_19).\n\nIf formula_20 is a pointclass of subsets of some collection formula_21 of Polish spaces, formula_21 closed under Cartesian product, and if formula_3 is a prewellordering of some subset formula_24 of some element formula_4 of formula_21, then formula_3 is said to be a formula_20-prewellordering of formula_24 if the relations formula_30 and formula_31 are elements of formula_20, where for formula_33,\n\nformula_20 is said to have the prewellordering property if every set in formula_20 admits a formula_20-prewellordering.\n\nThe prewellordering property is related to the stronger scale property; in practice, many pointclasses having the prewellordering property also have the scale property, which allows drawing stronger conclusions.\n\nformula_39 and formula_40 both have the prewellordering property; this is provable in ZFC alone. Assuming sufficient large cardinals, for every formula_41, formula_42 and formula_43\nhave the prewellordering property.\n\nIf formula_20 is an adequate pointclass with the prewellordering property, then it also has the reduction property: For any space formula_45 and any sets formula_46, formula_47 and formula_48 both in formula_20, the union formula_50 may be partitioned into sets formula_51, both in formula_20, such that formula_53 and formula_54.\n\nIf formula_20 is an adequate pointclass whose dual pointclass has the prewellordering property, then formula_20 has the separation property: For any space formula_45 and any sets formula_46, formula_47 and formula_48 \"disjoint\" sets both in formula_20, there is a set formula_62 such that both formula_63 and its complement formula_64 are in formula_20, with formula_66 and formula_67.\n\nFor example, formula_39 has the prewellordering property, so formula_69 has the separation property. This means that if formula_47 and formula_48 are disjoint analytic subsets of some Polish space formula_4, then there is a Borel subset formula_63 of formula_4 such that formula_63 includes formula_47 and is disjoint from formula_48.\n\n"}

He was United States Commissioner of Pensions under presidents James A. Garfield and Chester A. Arthur, and was Treasurer of the Republican National Committee. He was wounded and lost his leg at Gettysburg.\n\nWilliam Wade Dudley was born in Weathersfield Bow, Vermont, the son of Reverend John Dudley, a well-known Congregational minister whose sermons were widely reprinted. Reverend Wade was a graduate of Yale Seminary, a sometime missionary to the Choctaw Indians, and a descendant of William Dudley, one of the earliest settlers of Guilford, Connecticut, in 1639. Dudley's mother was Abigail Wade, a granddaughter of Col. Nathaniel Wade, a staff officer to General George Washington during the Revolutionary War.\n\nHe married his first wife, Theresa Fiske, in 1864, and they had four children together. After his wife's death in 1897, he married Nannie A. Robinson. Dudley died in Washington, D.C., in 1909.\n\nAfter studying at Phillips Academy, Danville, in Vermont, and at Russell Military Academy in New Haven, Connecticut, he joined the Union Army as captain of the Richmond City Greys—volunteers for service in the American Civil War. Dudley's company was incorporated into the 19th Indiana Volunteer Regiment of the famed Iron Brigade of the Army of the Potomac. At age 19, at the Battle of Antietam, he took command of the regiment after the death of Lieutenant Colonel Alois O. Bachman. Following the battle, Dudley was quickly promoted to Major (September 18, 1862), and then Lieutenant Colonel (October 6, 1862). \n\nAfter losing 79 percent of his men at the Battle of Gettysburg, and having his right leg amputated on the field, he served as an army inspector and judge advocate and captain in the Veteran Reserve Corps. For gallantry in battle, he was awarded an honorary brevet to Brigadier General of Volunteers on March 13, 1865.\n\nFollowing the end of the war he became a civilian lawyer in 1870, then the U.S. marshal for Indiana in 1879, commissioner of pensions under appointment of Presidents James Garfield and Chester A. Arthur in 1881. In 1888 he was appointed Treasurer of the Republican National Committee. He returned to practicing law in 1887. \n\nIn 1888 having been made Treasurer of the Republican National Committee, Dudley was involved in the 1888 elections and one of the most intense political campaigns in decades, with Indiana dead even between the Democratic incumbent President, Grover Cleveland, and the Republican challenger, Benjamin Harrison.\n\nAlthough this job did not strictly involve him in state politics, Dudley wrote a circular letter to Indiana's county chairmen, telling them to \"Divide the floaters into blocs of five, and put a trusted man with the necessary funds in charge of these five, and make them responsible that none get away and that all vote our ticket,\" and promising adequate funding for this. \nUnfortunately for the Republicans, the Democrats managed to get hold of the letter and they distributed hundreds of thousands of copies in the last days of the campaign. Given Dudley's unsavory reputation, few people believed his denials.\n\nThe attack on \"blocs of five\" with the suggestion that pious General Benjamin Harrison was trying to buy the election enlivened the Democratic campaign and stimulated the nationwide movement to replace ballots printed and distributed by the parties with the secret \"Australian ballot\". Benjamin Harrison's electoral votes topped Cleveland's to win the election.\n\n"}

Dark Horse published an additional ten issues before the series was canceled. Dark Horse also published a special introductory Roachmill story in \"Dark Horse Presents\" No. 17 (April 1988), to announce the acquisition of the character.\n\nTwo trade paperback collections were issued. The first, \"Roachmill Book 1: Framed\" (1988), collects the first five issues.

It is bounded on the north-east by the Libona, at the south by the Lantapan, and on the west by Talakag. It has a land area of 328.34 square kilometres based on the cadastral survey made by the DENR.\n\nTypical of the province environmental condition, Baungon belongs to the third type of climate which is relatively dry from March to April and wet from May to December.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town was once a Barangay of the capital town, Malaybalay. It was named after a Banglas tree, endemic tree species that inhabit and growing abundantly and distinctively only on this portion of the upper Pulangui. Banglas is hardwood that usually grows in the rocky portion of the Bobunawan riverbanks. Kabanglasan literally means a place that has plenty of Banglas.\n\nCabanglasan was created as a separate municipality from Malaybalay on August 13, 1979 by virtue of Republic Act 6489.\n\nThe movement for the separation of Cabanglasan from his mother municipality (Malaybalay) began in the early 1960s when the people of Pulangi region petitioned for the secession. This prompted the passage of House Bill No. 2789 in Congress by the then Congressman Cesar M. Fortich. The bill was enacted into law without executive approval under Republic Act 6489 but its implementation was delayed due to the declaration of martial law.\n\nDue to the persistence of the residents as spearheaded by Datu Maliwanag (Saturnino P. Linsagan), then President Ferdinand E. Marcos referred the matter to the mother municipality, Malaybalay. A plebiscite was then held wherein the majority voted for the implementation of RA 6489. On August 13, 1979, the first set of municipal officials headed by Mayor Saturnino P. Linsagan aka Datu Maliwanag to his tribesmen, took their oath and held their first session.\n\nCabanglasan is geographically located between east longitude 125 degrees 27 minutes and north latitude 8 degrees and 3 minutes. It is located at the eastern part of the province of Bukidnon, bounded in the north and west by the City of Malaybalay and the south by the Municipality of San Fernando, and in the east by the province of Agusan del Sur.\n\nIt has a total area of , of which 38% is Alienable and Disposable (A&D) land and 62% is timberland. It has 15 barangays, 5 of which are situated within timberland namely; Freedom, Mandahican, Mauswagon, Jasaan, and Cananga-an. Five barangays, namely; Anlugan, Cabanglasan proper, Iba, Mandaing and Dalacutan are located within A&D land while the remaining 5 barangays such as; Cabulohan, Capinonan, Imbatug, Paradise and Mauswagon are located within both timberland and A&D.\n\nIt occupies 2.52% of the total provincial area of Bukidnon and 0.74% of the regional area (Northern Mindanao).\n\nThe major part of the municipality is classified under slope class 8 to 15 percent. Where such areas are found, it is contiguous to level areas, identified as water retaining areas potentially suited to intensive palay production. Along its North, East and South boundaries is slope class 30% and above, hilly and mountainous are declared as forestal, but not necessarily foliaged. Cabanglasan has an average elevation of 465 meters above sea level.\n\nCabanglasan fall under the fourth type. It means that rainfall is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. May to December is usually the period with long rainfalls. While driest months last from January to April. Mountain climates reasonably form another type of climate. As far as some climatological elements are concerned, except as to temperature, rainfall generally increases with height.\n\nCabanglasan is politically subdivided into 15 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Cabanglasan was people, with a density of .\n\nCabanglasan was created to become a municipality on August 13, 1979 by virtue of Republic Act 6489. On the following year, 1980, a regular census on population and housing was conducted nationwide, wherein Cabanglasan had an actual population count of 16,843.\n\nIn 1990, there was another census of population and housing. Because of the presence of the two logging companies, the T.H. Valderrama and Talakag Timber Incorporated, the population of this town grew to 26,351, an increase of about 9,508 or 56.45%. During those Censal years Barangays Cabulohan, Capinonan and Imbatug had a greater number of population because it was where the logging companies established their plant and housing camps.\n\nIn 1995, a mid-decade census on population and housing was made. During that year, Cabanglasan had a population of 29,288 or an increase of 11.15%. However, due to the closure of the two logging companies in 1991, the population of the three barangays mentioned above decreased while the population of other barangays increased. Barangay Poblacion had an increase of 68.2116%. In 1990, its population was only 2,287 but it grew to 3,847 in 1995. This increase was due to the influx of former workers from the logging companies who settled in the neighboring barangays. As a result, the overall population count of the municipality increased at an average growth rate of 2.50%.\n\nAnother factor of this population increase is the ongoing progress and development of this municipality, such as road accessibility to the different barangays and sitios, farm modernization, electrification and the coming of small and medium investors to establish their business in the Poblacion. With this positive trend we it can be projected that the increase of population will continue and the coming of investors would provide job opportunities to our people.\n\nBeing typically landlocked, the means of transportation for intra-municipal travel is through jeepneys and motorcycles, buses and jeepneys can be availed of for travels going out of the municipality.\n\nMost of the vehicles (82%) are privately owned. About 16 percent are public utility vehicles while only 2% belonged to the government.\n\nThe whole stretch of the national highway (21.61 km) is still gravel-paved. Of the 15.065 km municipal road, 4% percent has already been converted to concrete pavement, 9% is gravel-paved, and the rest is still earth-paved. The aggregate length of barangay roads in the municipality has been recorded at 287.409 km. Nearly 41 percent (117.603) of this is gravel-paved, a little over half (56%) of the total length is still unpaved while only less than one percent (1%) has been concreted. It can also be noted that earth-paved roads – especially roads going to the interior sitios are not passable during rainy season.\n\nBridges link gaps between rivers. For areas which are not regular routes of land transportation but are bounded by rivers, hanging footbridges were constructed.\n\nPostal services of the municipality is being provided by the Bureau of Post which is manned by a Postmaster. Being undermanned the postmaster also served as the municipality’s letter carrier.\n\nFor telecommunication, the provincial government had installed a single side band radio at the municipality. This is actually part of the Provincial Radio Communication Network. Through this system the municipality is able to reach out to other parts of the province directly or via relay stations. This is being complemented by handheld radios in some barangays which the municipality used for transmitting messages to these areas. Cabanglasan’s populace is also kept abreast of recent information which is of regional and/or national significance through two Television channels which signal covered the municipality. These are the ABS-CBN (Channel 2) and GMA (Channel 12). AM and FM Band radio Stations from Malaybalay, Valencia, Cagayan and Davao also reached the municipality. Print media on the other hand only include a local newspaper (Bukidnon Newswatch) which has a weekly circulation.\n\nSprings, rivers and deep wells are the sources of water supply used for both domestic water supply and irrigation needs. Deep wells and springs are commonly used as potable water supply. Local government, congressional initiative, regional and senatorial funds are used to develop these sources. The municipal government’s ardent thrust to provide basic services to its constituents can be well manifested by its current pursuit to develop a level III type of water system through funding from the World Bank. The municipal government had entered into a loan agreement with the bank to develop a system that will provide for an individual pipe connection for each household within the barangays of Poblacion and Iba. Data shows that Level I and Level II type of systems are the most prevalent type of water supply in the municipality. Level I water system is currently serving 7.17% of the total households. Likewise, Level II is providing water for 47.39% of all households, while Level III only served 3.62% of the total. The rest (41.82%) still remained un-served by a water supply system\n\nThe health service in the Municipality of Cabanglasan is catered by the Municipal Health Office (MHO) and one private lying-in clinic. The former handles the public health services and some clinical services while the latter serves most of the clinical cases. The MHO is located at Poblacion and the nine Barangay Health Stations are located in the different barangays. These serve as channels in providing basic health services to the general populace. The office is manned by one Medical Doctor, one Dentist, one DOH-Nurse, four permanent Rural Health Midwives (RHMs), five Job Order RHMs, one Rural Sanitary Inspector (RSI) and one Dental Aid. The health personnel is augmented by 175 Barangay Health Workers (BHW) 38 “hilots” and other health oriented NGOs such as BIDANI, MAP, and the German Rolling Clinic.\n\nHealth statistics showed that the four leading causes of morbidity fall under communicable diseases which are preventable in nature but there was a gradual increase of such cases in the past few years. This increase could be attributed to the lack of permanent personnel assigned in far-flung and strategically located barangays. Another contributing factor is the inadequate supply of medicines and medical logistics which are necessary in the implementation of health services and programs. Records from the nutrition program of the municipality revealed the high prevalence rate of malnutrition has gradually decreased. This accomplishment was due to the full support of the Local Government Unit and Department of Health, and the increased awareness of the general populace on proper nutrition.\n\nThe total population is 29,288 as of 1995 having a ratio of one policeman per 1,220 inhabitants. The national standard ratio is one policeman per one thousand inhabitants. Therefore, Cabanglasan police force needs 15 Policemen to meet the standard ratio.\n\nSpecial Force (SF) of the Philippine Army (PA) established four strategic detachment, located at Barangay Poblacion, Freedom, Cananga-an and Jasaan. Each detachment is manned by two regular elements of the SF-PA assisted by their respective CAFGUs (Citizen Armed Forces Geographical Units). Cabanglasan police force is headed by one Police Commission Officer (PCO) as Chief of Police (COP), twenty three Police Non-Commission Officer (PCNO’s) with five police community precinct. Each PCP headed by one policeman assisted by their respective Bantay Bayan/CVOs (Civilian Volunteers Organization). The area of responsibility or coverage has one PCP for every three Barangays.\n\nThe data on existing schools and facilities are complete which are indicative of the overall picture of the District of Cabanglasan. There are 26 elementary schools within the municipality three schools are within the urban center, while the remaining 23 schools are distributed throughout the rural areas. Each barangay has at least one elementary school with Iba and Poblacion having the biggest area in terms of hectares. All schools have playgrounds, some have clinics but none of them has a laboratory, shop or library.\n\nThe Municipality of Cabanglasan has two secondary schools, one is a public school and one is a private secondary school, namely: Cabulohan-Paradise Nationalized Agricultural High School and Fr. Leoni Memorial School. A comparative analysis of enrolment showed that the public school has the highest enrolment with a total of 915 students for the current year, while on the private school has maintained its enrolment for the last five years with 587 students.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nHistorically, the first settlers of Damulog were the Manobos. They are the indigenous people of the place. Testimonials of the old folks disclosed that the name of the place was “Ramulog” meaning a place to take a bath. A river at the town proper is a place where the Manobos take a bath. It also became a place of gathering where the men were fishing nearby, their wives washed clothes and the children are either swimming or gathering shells. Over time, “Ramulog” changed to “Damulog” due to assimilation of the Manobos and the new settlers. The river is now called Damulog River.\n\nThe opening of the Sayre Highway in 1953 opened Damulog into external trade. Manobos and Muslims from nearby Cotabato gathered abaca from the forests and sell it to the traders. The traders processed the abaca into raw fiber and resell it in Cagayan de Oro City process these into fiber. More immigrants from the Visayas came and started to acquire farm lots. Slowly, the new settlers soon dominated trade and business.\n\nDamulog celebrates its Araw ng Damulog every 16th day of August with exhilarating activities that comprehends every walk of life. The municipality celebrates its town fiesta every 7th day of October of the year in honor of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary. In line are different activities that draw many expectators from other municipalities and neighboring towns.\n\nDamulog once a barrio of Kibawe was officially created a regular Municipality in January 1972 pursuant to Republic Act No. 6369. The author was Congressman Cesar \"Titang\" Fortich. The approval was on August 16, 1971 and Damulog started as municipality in 1972. Presently, the municipality has seventeen (17) regular barangays, namely: Aludas, Angga-an, Kinapat, Kiraon, Kitingting, Lagandang, Macapari, Maican, Migcawayan, New Compostela, Old Damulog, Omonay, Poblacion, Pocopoco, Sampagar, San Isidro, and Tangkulan.\n\nIt is difficult to trace the political lineage who handled the reins of power prior to the creation of the barrio of Damulog into a municipality. The kapitan del barrio then was Tito C. Balangyao who assumed as mayor upon its creation as a municipality in 1972. He remained mayor until March 1980 when Emiterio D. Luis won the mayoralty election. At the height of the EDSA People Power revolution, Corazon C. Aquino toppled President Ferdinand E. Marcos and subsequently, Mr. Luis was replaced by Erlito Bagas who was appointed as Officer-In-Charge (OIC) in the Office of the Mayor. After about two months, Rev. Romeo P. Tiongco assumed as mayor. He relinquished his post a year after wherein then Vice Mayor Basilio Beltran assumed the top post.\n\nIn 1992 election, Emiterio D. Luis again won the mayoralty post. It was during his term that RA 7160 known as the Local Government Code of 1991 was implemented. It was also this time that local governance became multidisciplinary and multifaceted. He finished his three terms in 1998.\n\nIn July 1998, the first lady chief executive was elected. She was then Josefina G. Tero who served a one-term office. She was succeeded by Fortunato E. Gudito, a retired military intelligence officer, who won the May 2001 local election. He served two terms.\n\nIn the May 2007 elections, Romeo P. Tiongco contested Gudito and won and is serving now as the incumbent mayor of the municipality of Damulog.\n\nDamulog is politically subdivided into 17 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Damulog, Bukidnon, was people, with a density of .\n\nDamulog is accessible by land transportation. The existing land transportation in the city consists of multicabs from nearby towns, single motorcycles, buses from Cagayan de Oro City and General Santos City, tricycles, and private vehicles facilitate the movement of people and goods to and from all places in the town. Traveling from Poblacion is mainly by land through all kinds of vehicles.\n\nDamulog is traversed by Sayre Highway. This is from barangay Sampagar in the north to Old Damulog, Poblacion, Pocopoco, Macapari to Omonay in the south. There is concrete road from Poblacion to Kinapat, then all-weather road from Kinapat to Kiraon, then again concrete from Kiraon to Old Damulog forming a complete loop with the Sayre Highway. Another loo is the Sayre Highway in Pocopoco to Kinapat to Poblacion. The third loop is the Poblacion to Doncilyon to Old Damulog.\n\nMost of these roads were built with grants from Asian Development Bank under the ARC Program. The Poblacion to Kinapat concrete road is also a part of the program.\n\nBarangays Old Damulog and Macapari has covered courts. All 17 barangays have their respective office building, health center, Tanod outpost and complete school buildings.\n\nTo focus on other development concern, the local government spun off its water service creating the Damulog Water System. The spinning-off was a part of the grant in 2013 from the SALINTUBIG program of the Department of Health. Before 2013, the water system provides running water for 2 hours every 2 days. Water was so scarce that water cannot reached households away from the transmission line. The new system now provides 24 hour service which is managed by the water district.\n\n17 Barangays enjoy electricity supplied by the First Bukidnon Electric Cooperative or popularly known in the town as FIBECO. All barangays have either Level 2 or Level 3 water system.\n\nMobile services are primarily offered by Smart Communications, Globe Telecom, and Sun Cellular. Internet services are also offered by Sun Cellular, Smart Communications, and Globe Telecom in 3G and LTE or 4G technology.\n\nAll barangays have complete elementary schools. Day Care centers are also present in barangays and sitios where there is considerable number of children. Secondary schools include the Old Damulog NHS, the swanky Macapari NHS, the private Xavier de Damulog HS and Kitingting Laguna Academy in barangay Kitingting.\n\nWithin Damulog and its periphery, the Korea-based Join Together Society built 34 school buildings with 2-classroom each. Locations are really remote areas providing precious education to children. This is also part of the peace-building effort of the local government promoting co-existence to Lumad, Muslims and Christians.\n\n\n"}

The place was then a little Sitio of Maramag. As the Christian settlers from Luzon & Visayas began to flock and settle in the area. Datu Dangaan followers ran and hide their families in the forest and returned to their home only when they knew the settlers were not around.\n\nThis leads the settler to call the “Dagandagan”. It took ample time for the settler to befriend the natives. When the natives and the Christian settlers finally united, they made representation to the Municipal Government of Maramag to form a regular barrio within the territory of Datu Dangaan. They agreed to call the barrio Dangcagan in honor of the natives.\n\nThe first set of officers was headed by Mayor Vicente Cabiling, originally appointed to the position in 1961 and was elected and served for ten (10) consecutive years, he constructed the old Municipal Hall on top of the hill in the poblacion.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe first people who settled this place before was a certain Datu Andarol, his wife Ba-e Mahanu, and their son Datu ‘Mangginayun’. Datu Andarol was a ruler and the leader of the Manobo tribe settling the village of Minduso, which was the old name of Don Carlos. The place was covered with forests and access by outlanders was prohibited unless permitted by the datu. Minduso was the home of Datu Andarol's descendants. Upon the arrival of the Spaniards, the datu was succeeded by his son, Datu Mangginayun. With their contacts with the Spaniards and missionaries, Spanish naming conventions and Christianity was introduced, and Datu Mangginayun adopted the name \"Antonio\", hence his full name was now Datu ‘Mangginayun’ Antonio Sagandilan Sr. He was married to Ba-e Antonina Manlayuan. His leadership reflects that of his father, as he implemented tribal laws and settled criminal offenses, particularly murder. As the leader of his tribal community, he also presided wedding ceremonies and settled dowries.\n\nThe first popular Spanish stranger who approached Datu ‘Mangginayun’ Antonio Sr. was Tomás Sandoval. He requested a parcel of land that he intend to borrow and to till, the datu conceded to his request. As part of the agreement, Tomás was to give the part of his harvest as a share to the datu. Several years later, another Spaniard by the name of \"Elizalde\" came and, like Tomás, requested the datu for lands to establish ranches. The lands lent by the datu to Elizalde were: lands in Pantil-pantilan, Migtutugop, the lands along the Mulita river, the today-famous Squash Mountain, and the Tugas Falls. As the agricultural ventures of these two Spaniards flourished, Cebuanos (referred by the Lumads, or natives, as \"Dumagats\") and other Spaniards who came from Cagayan de Misamis and other coastal towns of Misamis were encouraged to settle and populate the area that comprises the present-day Don Carlos.\n\nCensus registry for the settlers of Minduso was only located at Ramag (Manobo for ‘breakfast’), which has a fully established local government facilities and would later be known as Maramag. Antonio Sr.'s son, Datu ‘Mangginayun’ Antonio Sagandilan Jr. was born on March 17, 1917 at Miuvan (now Barangay Sinangguyan) and had his birth registered at Maramag. Antonio Jr. was drafted into the USAFFE before World War II and completed his training with the rank of corporal. However, he was called upon to fight on the outbreak of war, and his family did nothing about it.\n\nWhen the war ended, Antonio Jr. succeeded his father in the leadership of his tribe as a datu in 1946. He was first a tribal councilor, and later became a barangay captain of the whole of Minduso. During his time of service, Señora Remedios ‘Meding’ Fortich de Ozamis personally visited Antonio Jr. and she petitioned the name change of Miuvan (which is now Barangay Sinangguyan) to ‘Don Carlos’ in his son's memory, Don Carlos Fortich Ozamis, who was the governor of Bukidnon in 1904 and as a gratitude for living in the land which the Sagandilans flourished. At first, the datu declined, as the flourishing enclave has significance for their patrimony. Eventually, under Republic Act No. 4800, Minduso and other neighboring villages and barangays were clustered to form the municipality of Don Carlos in 1966.\n\nDon Carlos is situated in the southern part of the province. It is located south of the City of Malaybalay, from Cagayan de Oro City, from the Cotabato City, from Davao City, and from south of Manila. The town is bounded by the municipalities of Maramag in the north, Kitaotao in the south, Quezon in the east, Pangantucan and Kadingilan in the west. The town is known for its famous landmark, Lake Pinamaloy.\n\nThere are 3 types of soil that cover the municipality. These soils, which are generally clay, are Kidapawan Clay, Adtuyon Clay and Macolod Clay.\n\nThe terrain of the municipality of Don Carlos is generally flat except the mountain range on the eastern part of the municipality. The highest elevation is above sea level and the lowest elevation is below sea level.\n\nFlat to gently sloping areas ranging in slope from 0-8% is the most prevalent terrain in the municipality, which covers 198.96 km² (93.09%) of the total land area of the municipality. Moderately sloping to undulating lands ranging in slope from 8-18% occupies approximately 7.65 km². Rolling to moderately steep lands, sloping from 18-30%, covers 4.19 km² of land. Areas with slope above 30% covers 2920.09 km².\n\nThe municipality's climate falls under the third type. Climate under this type experiences rainy season in the months of April to September. The latest data from the DA shows that the months July to November registered the highest average annual rainfall that reached its peak in the month of July at .\n\nDon Carlos is politically subdivided into 29 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Don Carlos, Bukidnon, was people, with a density of .\n\nCommercial activities in the municipality of Don Carlos pass through a network of various commercial establishments that scatter all over the municipality. Sari-sari stores dominate these establishments with heavy concentration in barangay centers, especially in barangay Don Carlos Sur.\n\nBased on CY 2000 records of the Municipal Treasurer's Office (MTO), the municipality of Don Carlos had a total of 350 commercial establishments, majority of these commercial establishments are engaged in retailing, merchandising, food and beverage, catering and servicing.\n\nDon Carlos is an agricultural municipality. It is endowed with vast tracts of fertile agricultural lands coupled with a favorable climate. Many people in the area are greatly dependent on the produce of the land. Being the main source of income of the municipality, agriculture utilizes about 149.5894 km² of land, representing 70% of the total land area of the municipality for the production of various crops.\n\nIn terms of production, in the year 1998, rice yielded 3,156.60 metric tons both in irrigated and rainfed farms. White and yellow corn production accounted to 39,086.10 metric tons covering 66.98 km² representing 11.78% to agricultural area. sugarcane production as second major crop next to corn, covers a physical area of 50 km² representing 33.42% with a total production of 21,000 metric tons.\n\nThe cash crops include leafy green vegetables, fruits, legumes and root crops. Coconut, sugarcane, banana, jackfruit, cacao and rubber comprise the commercial crops. Commercial crops cover 24.4194 km² and has a total production 2,523.75 metric tons.\n\nThe Municipality of Don Carlos is naturally endowed with sites which have been seen with strong potentials to be tourist destinations. These are the uncommercialized Lake Pinamaloy in Barangay Pinamaloy; the Sinangguyan and Kahulugan Waterfalls in Barangay Sinangguyan; and the Linking Caves and Spring in Barangay San Antonio East.\n\n\n\n\nEvidently, these sites are enriched with innate natural physical features. Private sector and government efforts would be done to explore these potentials with extensive promotions in order to draw investors and encourage development and tourists.\n\nDon Carlos will be the site of the proposed Bukidnon Domestic Airport which will be located at the unused former Maraymaray Airstrip in the municipality's Barangay Maraymaray. The sequestered airstrip was previously owned by the Cojuancos. The Bukidnon Airport Development Project was included in the Department of Transportation's budget for 2018. Funds for the construction and improvement of all road networks leading to the proposed airport have been allocated by the DPWH. Construction of the domestic airport was scheduled in 2018. It will be the fourth domestic airport operating in Northern Mindanao following Laguindingan Airport in Misamis Oriental, Labo Airport in Ozamiz City and Camiguin Airport in Camiguin. Groundbreaking of the said airport was done in May 2018.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nDuring the earlier times, there was a certain ethnic group headed by its chieftain named Datu Mandaganasa. He was then looking for a place located between two rivers as the possible home for his tribe, Kampong. They found vast tracts of land located between the Iniawan and Pinalpalan Rivers and decided to make the place as their territorial domain. As time passed by, the place got its name, Kadingilan from the corrupted native words Kadiay (which means \"ours\") and Matingilan (which means \"temporary\").\n\nThe growth and development of Kadingilan began after World War II. Migrants from all over the country flocked into its fertile lands. The original occupants were slowly replaced by Cebuanos, Boholanos, Warays and Igorots/Ifugaos. The original inhabitants were eventually eased-out by the influx of incoming Dumagats (a general term used for Christians).\n\nWhen Bukidnon was created as a separate province from Agusan del Norte, Kadingilan became a barrio of Maramag since 1945. It existed as such until Kibawe was created as a regular municipality on July 1, 1956. Kadingilan was then taken from Maramag and became one of the regular barrios of Kibawe.\n\nOn August 16, 1971, Kadingilan was created as a municipality of Bukidnon pursuant to Republic Act 6368.).\n\nThe first set of Municipal Officials who pioneered the development of Kadingilan were:\n\n\nKadingilan lies within grid coordinates from 7O 20’ 31” north longitude and from 124O 49’ to 125O 2’ east latitude. Kadingilan is located along the south-western border of the province of Bukidnon. It is bounded on the north by the municipality of Don Carlos; north-east by the municipality of Dancagan; east by the municipality of Kibawe; southeast by the municipality of Damulog and on the south and south-west by the province of North Cotabato and on the west by the province of Lanao del Sur and north-west by the municipality of Pangantucan.\n\nThe topography of the municipality is characterized as rugged terrain with rolling, hilly and mountainous portions. These hills and mountains are dissected by rivers and creeks, such as the Muleta River on the eastern part which serves as the common natural boundary with the municipalities of Damulog, Dancagan and Kibawe. The Maridugao and Kidanggin Rivers at the southern portion separates Kadingilan from the municipality of Pangantucan and the province of Lanao del Sur.\n\nThe climate of the municipality belongs to type C agro-climatic zone. This zone is the most extensive and covers most of the present and potential agricultural area in the province. Relatively low rainfall is due to rain shadow effect of the mountainous belt on the eastern side of Bukidnon. Rainfall distribution is likely to vary in the southern part of the province because of the presence of adjoining hills and mountain ranges. The heaviest rainfall occurs during the months of May to September.\n\nAbout fifty two percent of the total land area has an elevation of 300–400 meters above sea level while forty percent is between 0–30 m. asl. Only hundred fifty hectares are within the elevation of 500 meters and above and these are mostly found within the Payao and Matampay hills.\n\nTwenty six percent of the total land area of the municipality has slope of 18-30% which is described as rolling to hilly. These are areas classified as timberland within the barangays of Cabadiangan and Mabuhay. Twenty-four percent has a slope category of 3-8%, characterized as sloping to undulating. Only about fifteen percent or a total of 2,628 hectares fall under the slope range of 0-3% (level to gently sloping covering more than thirty six percent of the total alienable and disposable lands.\n\nThe soil type of Kadingilan is predominantly Kidapawan clay. It is characterized as light brown to dark brown in color, hard when dry; plastic and sticky when moist and wet and has fair organic matter content.\n\nThere are two type of drainage identified: internal and external. The former is mainly influenced by soil texture which is the removal of excess water within the soil profile. The latter is influenced by slope and physiographic position, refers to the removal of surface water. Usually when a soil is poorly drained externally, it is also poorly drained internally. Generally, all upland soils like the Kadingilan soils, on the account of their physiographic position are well drained internally and externally. The proposed Maridugao River Irrigation Project, is projected to irrigate 6,000 hectares of ricefields covering the barangays of Baroy, Poblacion, Sibonga, Kibogtok, Salvacion, Malinao, Husayan and portion of Pay-as.\n\nThe municipality has volcanic sedimentary and metamorphic rock origin. One identified rock type is limestone (cord/line limestone, N,Ls) characterized as light cream to cream in color, partly fragmental, calcareous formation including reef limestone, bio-clastic limestone and calcasenite. The other type is sandstone and shale (N1) which is light brown and gray in color, thick transgressive marine deposits, and largely massive sandstone layers imbedded with siltstone and shale strata.\n\nKadingilan is politically subdivided into 17 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Kadingilan was people, with a density of .\n\nThe period from 1975 to 1980 had a population growth of 3.98%. However, the next 10 years registered a population growth on only 1.48% due to disturbances of peace and order which caused out-migration. The 1995 census showed a growth rate of 1.76 percent, slightly higher than the 1990 count. The 1995 data also showed that four barangays - Baroy, Matampay, Pinamangguan and San Andres - experienced a decrease in population. This was due to migration of people to urban areas in search of better opportunities.\n\nThe population density of Kadingilan stood at 147 person per square kilometer in the 1995 census of population. This manifested a slight increase of 8.16 percent over that of the 1990 count which was pegged at 135 persons per square kilometer. Like most other parts of the province, the Poblacion is the most densely populated barangay. The 1995 count revealed the population density of the Poblacion at 598 persons per square kilometer or roughly 6 persons for every hectare of land. Barangays Malinao and Kibalagon followed with a population density of nearly 3 persons per hectare. The most sparsely populated barangay on the other hand is Matampay with only about 86 persons per square kilometer or only about 1 person per one hectare of land.\n\nThe people living in the municipality of Kadingilan are of diverse ethnic origins. Despite the situation, the Cebuano language is still generally the main language spoken by nearly 83 percent of the population. Boholano - a language native to the island of Bohol is also spoken by about 8 percent of the total population. It can also be observed that Manobo - a language spoken by the lumads - is used by nearly 5 percent of Kadingilan's population as of the 1995 census.\n\nProjected labor Force was derived using the Labor Force Profile. Using the percentage share allocation it was derived that the household population 15 years old and over will be at about 19,395 constituting 57.24 percent of the total population. About 14,954 of these is estimated to be gainfully employed providing support to the unemployed population in the labor force which is estimated at 2,525. Further, the same population is also expected to provide the same support to the depended population and those which belong to the same age group (15 years and over) but are not in the labor force.\n\nThe local organization of the municipality is composed of 12 offices. Three of these offices wereunder the national government but are now devolved to the local government in adherence to the implementation of RA 7160. This law, otherwise known as the local government code of 1991 devolved to the local government the office of the Department of Health, Agriculture and the Social Welfare and Development. \nIn addition to the 12 offices, the municipal government also created the Economic Enterprise Division. This is especially for the purpose of generating funds for the local coffers through local efforts. This division had 3 important sections manned by a total of 25 employees. The sections which have helped to augment generation of local financial resources are the Municipal Market and Slaughterhouse, Municipal Waterworks and Heavy Equipment Pool.\n\nThe organizational structure being followed by the municipality of Kadingilan is in adherence to the mandates as dictated by the Local Government Code of 1991\n\n"}

The Mamadas people were nomadic by nature and subsisted on hunting and forest products. They maintained small plots of corn, camote and gabi in places where they built their temporary shelters. They practised a feudal type of government and were responsible only to their datus who governed as their political chieftain, judge, religious leader and armed-forces chief. The most famous among the “datus” was Datu Mambantayao. Datu Mambantayao's bravery and love for his subjects were unexcelled and remain in the hearts and minds of the people to this day. One of the historic events of his life as a datu was the capturing of a lady whom he loved. She was abducted by a tribe from Bugcaon, Malaybalay, Bukidnon, seventy kilometers away from Kibawe. Datu Mambantayao, along with his armed trained warriors marched to Bugcaon, which they attacked heavily, plundering and killing the Bugcaons’ chieftain for the recovery of the lady who he later married. Datu Mambantayao named this place Kibawe from the word “Guibawe” meaning recovery.\n\nBukidnon was eventually created as a separate province from Agusan. Kibawe became a barrio of Maramag.

The growth and development of the municipality served high after the Second World War as immigrants from all over the country (mainly from Visayas and Mindanao) came flocking into the fertile valleys and low mountains of the community.\n\nThe original populace of the town, the Manobos, have practically been replaced by the above-mentioned lowlanders. To date, only a few Manobos remain in the interior barrios. In the year 1972, the big barrios of Damulog and Kadingilan were created into separate municipalities. Thus, Kibawe retained the land area of . The Kibaweños of today are people of diverse ethnic origin including the autochthonous Manobos and Bukidnon Lumad tribes, as well as the immigrant Cebuanos, Boholanos, Ilonggos, Negrenses and Warays.

Due to tremendous influx of settlers coming from the different parts of the country, it becomes an independent municipality.\n\nIn 1951 Kalilangan become one of the settlement areas under the LASEDECO (Land Settlement and Development Corporation). Christian settlers came and settled in this place. When LASEDECO was dissolved, it was replaced immediately by National Resettlement Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA) during the time of then President Ramon Magsaysay. Another batch of settlers came composed of different tribes and other ethnic groups in the country. They were Cebuanos, Waray, Boholanos, Bicolanos, Tagalogs, Ivatans, Ilonggos, Ilocanos, Capangpangan and other tribes in the island of Mindanao. Settlers were given aid by the government particularly working animals, subsistence, farm tools and others. As years rolled on land cultivation progressed and the settlers started planting different kinds of crops. Roads were opened and commerce flowed freely to the new barrio of Kalilangan. Other settlers also started engaging in business\n\nIn view of the fact that Kalilangan was considered as one of the most progressive barrios in the municipality of Pangantucan and by virtue of Republic Act No. 4788 approved on June 18, 1966, a bill was sponsored by ex-Congressman Benjamin N. Tabios, creating Kalilangan into a 6th class municipality and was organized and implemented on January 1, 1968, just after the 1967 elections.\n\nThe Municipality of Kalilangan is bounded on the north by the Municipality of Talakag, on the east and south by the Municipality of Pangantucan and on the west by the Province of Lanao del Sur.

Five years later NSO conducted another Census of Population registering 15,389 inhabitants revealing that for 5 years time 1970-1975 the municipality has reached a population increase of 24.85%. On the next 5 years from 1975-1980 NSO recorded 19.01% of inhabitants as has been added to the population of the municipality, revealing therefore that a population growth rate drop of 5.84% compared to that of 1970-1975 had happened.\n\nAfter 10 years the next population census had been conducted by NSO registering a population of 23,923 inhabitants on 1990. In comparison with the municipality’s census two decades ago, from 1970–1980 and from 1980-1990 a population increase of 48.58% and 30.62% respectively was observed.

When the Spaniards invaded Cotabato, in one of their drives to expand their colonial control over the Philippines, Datu Tayaotao was called upon for help by one Datu Muslim. The combined forces of the Muslims and Manobo successfully repulsed the Spanish operation.\n\nA feast was declared by the Muslim chief to honor and thank Datu Tayaotao and his men. During the feast, the Muslim chief offered his only daughter to Datu Tayaotao to be his wife, as reward and bond, to strengthen the relation of the two tribes.\n\nThe wedding took place at Datu Tayaotao’s enclave, followed by a three-day feast. The Muslim Datu, overwhelmed by the gaiety and lavishness of the celebration, proclaimed and called Datu Tayaotao as Datu Kitaotao, the chief of the land of wealth. After his death, the locality was named after Datu Kitaotao.\n\nKitaotao was once part of the district of Maramag. The creation of Kibawe in 1956 as a new district reclassified Kitaotao as part of Kibawe. After the Second World War, municipalities were created from the existing district and some settlements.

He happened to pass by a group of men who were digging gold on one of the gold mines. Talking in Spanish, the soldier inquired about the name of the place. The natives, who did not understand the language, thought the soldier was asking them how many gold stones they have already gathered.

However, there were divergent opinions to have this name because Abo-on refer only to a small cluster of settlers in the area.\n\nThe name was then changed to Malitbog, on the account of Malitbog River transversing their settlement and likewise the principal source of fishing, the native’s favorite livelihood. Their seat of government near the Malitbog River was also another consideration.\n\nBy virtue of Executive No. 42, dated June 25, 1963, Malitbog became a 5th Class municipality by operation of the provision of Section 2 of Republic Act 1515 and considered a regular municipality pursuant to Republic Act 23 and 88 duly signed by President Diosdado Macapagal.\n\nMalitbog is located at the northernmost part of the province, between parallel 8°25'35\" and 8°36'8\" North Latitude and Meridians 124°49'39\" and 125°11'39\" East Longitude.

Largest part of the area has severe erosion. Other areas with 18 percent slope can also be found near the border of Malitbog and Agusan del Sur. The elevation of this area is 600 to 800 meters ASL with slight erosion based in the erosion map. It can also be well further noted from the map that slope under the 0-3 percent are 3-8 percent are small patches that are scattered mostly in the south-western part and at Calabugao Plain near the Malitbog and Agusan del Sur.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nManolo Fortich used to be known as Maluko; it was renamed in 1957. Maluko also happens to be the name of one of the municipality's barangay.\n\nBefore the coming of the Spaniards, the term \"\"Bukidnon\"\" referred to as the semi-sedentary indigenous inhabitants of the high plateaus and rugged mountain ranges of central Mindanao. The more prominent of these peoples were the \"\"Manobos\"\" who were the earliest settlers of this region. Located on the northern part of Bukidnon, is the Municipality of Manolo Fortich.\nThe great pre-historic Asiatic migration was believed to have brought the early settlers of Bukidnon. It was theorized that they came from places of what is now known as Indonesia. Traveling by the sea, these migrants reached the gulf of Davao where some ventured further to areas of what is now known as Bukidnon and Misamis Oriental. The Asiatic beginnings of these people can be seen from their oral tradition and folktales, like the \"\"Kalikat Hu Mga Elaw Dini Ta Mindanao\"\" (Origin of the People of Mindanao). This folktale revolved on the story of two brothers from Asia \"who crossed the seas\" in their long journey \"towards the east\" which refers to the islands of the Philippines. The brothers reportedly landed in the island of Mindanao. With the region experiencing a drought, one of the brothers was forced to venture Northward in order to survive. He did this by following a dried up river to its almost dried up source, a lake. He settled and inter-married with the local inhabitants in the upstream of what is now known as Pulangi River. He and his family were considered as the ancestors of the present \"Bukidnons\".\nDuring the pre-historic era, the \"Bukidnons\", also called \"Montesses\" or mountain-people, had settled in the area of what is now the Province of Bukidnon. These people have remained traditional till 1860 preserving most of their customs and traditions. Furthermore, these people had not been significantly influenced by the Spanish colonizers because of their isolation. The rugged mountain ranges and high plateaus which serve as home to these people presented an overwhelming obstacle to these colonizers. The \"Bukidnons\" undoubtedly have links to the culture predominant in the Southeast Asian region as evidenced by the similar customs and traditions. Their presence here can be traced to the early migration of these Asians throughout the region. Today, the surviving tribes inhabiting the mountains of Bukidnon still bear the culture they have inherited from their ancestors.\n\nManolo Fortich is named after Don Manolo Fortich, a provincial resident of Barrio Damilag being the first Governor (1902-1914) of the District of Bukidnon.\n\nThe original name of the Municipality is Maluko, was governed by Santiago Mambinonsad who was appointed as Alcalde de Barrio from 1922 to 1924. It was during the term of Ciriaco Asilan as Presidente del Barrio from 1926 to 1928, that the seat of government was transferred in Tankulan, which became the permanent seat of Municipal Government. Mayor Mateo Gumaling, was the first appointed mayor of Manolo Fortich and in 1940 Margarito Cabang became the first elected Mayor.\n\nThe municipality of Manolo Fortich has a total area of , accounting 6.1% of the total land area of the province of Bukidnon.\n\nManolo Fortich is situated in the northern part of the Province of Bukidnon. It is about 40 minutes away from the bustling commercial center of Cagayan de Oro City.\n\nIt is bounded in the north by Cagayan de Oro City, Misamis Oriental, and the Municipality of Malitbog. In the east by the Municipality of Sumilao, in the west by the Municipality of Libona and Baungon and in the south by the rugged ranges of Mount Kitanglad.\n\nThe climate is classified as belonging to type IV or Intermediate. It is characterized by a moderate dry season with average rainfall of about . Its temperature is relatively cool and humid making the place suitable for production of any kind of crops. Production of high valued crops, which include vegetables, cut flowers and ornamentals is a big potential in the area.\n\nManolo Fortich is politically subdivided into 22 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Manolo Fortich was people, with a density of .\n\nIn the 2010 census, the population of the municipality was 91,026 people, up from 82,051 in 2007. Manolo Fortich belongs to a very low-density area which has only approximately 162 persons per square kilometre. The urban population is confined in barangays Agusan Canyon, Damilag and Tankulan.\n\nThere are three major ethnic groups in Manolo Fortich and they are the \"Higaonon\", \"Talaandig\" and the Cebuano-Bohol ethnic groups. the latter were mostly migrants from Cebu and Bohol who came to work as agricultural laborers in the planatation and orchard farms of the highland plateau, about 55% of the residents are \"Higaonons\" who are indigenous people in the area.\n\nCebuano, a Visayan language, is the major spoken language of the town. In the upland barangay plateau areas of Dahilayan, Guilang-guilang, Kalugmanan, Santiago and Ticala, the Higa-onons and Talaandigs speak their indigenous language called \"\"Binukid\"\".\n\nWhile Del Monte Philippines' manufacturing plant is located in nearby Cagayan de Oro, yet its pineapple plantation is located in the municipality specifically in Camp Phillips Road, Barangay Agusan Canyon while the company's clubhouse is located at Barangay San Miguel, still in Camp Phillips Road. The Del Monte Golf Course & Country Club on the other hand is located in Sitio Cawayanon, Barangay San Miguel. Just a few meters from the golf course is the Del Monte School, still located in Sitio Cawayanon. The Cawayanon Compound also located in Sitio Cawayanon is a residential area mostly inhabited by Del Monte employees.\n\nManolo Fortich has three major river systems crisscrossing the upstream and downstream agricultural lands. These are the Tagoloan, Mangima and Agusan Rivers, which serve as natural boundaries and drainage of excess water and run-off from around the municipality. The other rivers of the municipality are, among others: Dicklum, Kumaykay, Guihian, Tasaon and Kulaman Rivers. The river systems also serve as sources of potable water supply for domestic use.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nMaramag from “\"Ag Ramag\"”, a contracted Manobo term for “\"Ag Ramag Ki Dini\"”, which as freely translated, means “Let us eat our breakfast here.” The story as officially published by the late Prescioso Velez Abellanosa Sr. (a former municipal mayor) goes that the Manobos were constantly in conflict with the Maranaos for supremacy over the locality. Each time they set out for the battle they would stop on the bank of Pulangi River where flat stones that serve as their tables abound the area. Atop of these, they would draw their plans and eat their breakfast. This habit becomes their practice that even in times of peace and as a sign of good faith, these “Lumads”, the natives or early settlers invite others who happen to pass by to partake meals with them. Maramag then was a picnic ground were one can rest and take his meal as a short respite either from travel, trekking, hunting and trapping or from battle.\n\nThrough the years, even Christians (referred to as \"Dumagats\", literally 'seaborne/coming from beyond the sea') started to come and settle near the place. They too would stop and eat their meals on these big flat stones during hunting trips or as they travel on foot from one valley to another. As more and more Christian settlers occupied the surrounding places, Ag Ramag became more commonly called as Maramag – a homonym or a contraction of the original Manobo term “Ag Ramag”.\n\nThe political history of the municipality traces back in 1916 when the late Deputy Governor Cenon R. Paulican positively declared that people from different parts of the country began settling in the area. Years later, the people informally elected a leader among them as the incipient local government started to take form. They called their leaders “Captain”. These leaders normally remained in office for as long as their political abilities and faithfulness to duty would allow; Monarchial in so many ways although an election process is in place. This system prevailed up to the Second World War.\n\nIn 1945, the first appointed Mayor was put in place to head the municipal government followed by two others. The first election for the position of the Municipal Mayor was held in 1951. The election for the members of the Barrio Council was held in 1955. From then on, ten other Municipal Mayors were either appointed or elected in the past 56 years up to the present.\n\nMaramag was formally created as a municipality through Executive Order No. 272 issued by then President Carlos P. Garcia on July 1, 1956. The Poblacion of Maramag was formerly located in Barangay Base Camp, three (3) kilometers away from the present Poblacion. After World War II and upon the completion of the Sayre Highway, people started to move along the highway in a linear then nodal fashion and later concentrically forming the Poblacion today, composing Barangay North and South Poblacions.\n\nThe municipal boundaries between Maramag, Pangantucan and Kibawe were established in 1935 by the then deputy Governor Cenon Paulican. Then, Maramag, with the organization of the former barangays Don Carlos and Quezon into regular municipalities, was reduced to its present area of about 58,198.98 hectares. As reported too, in the late sixties, a Memorandum of Agreement between Maramag and Valencia, Bukidnon was forged as to their common boundaries. Purportedly, the Lumbo Creek, as it flows to the Pulangi River defines the demarcation between the two municipalities.\nThe current seat of the government of Maramag consists of two barangays: the North and South Poblacion. When the Central Mindanao University (CMU) is transferred to Musuan, Dologon, Maramag, Bukidnon from Managok, Malaybalay, Bukidnon, the municipality became the host of the premier agricultural school in Mindanao.\n\nThe municipality likewise served as the nodal point of the major national roads of the province to the different places of Mindanao namely: the Bukidnon–Wao (Lanao del Sur) road the Bukidnon – North Cotobato Road and the Bukidnon – Cagayan de Oro Road.\n\nMaramag boasts its agricultural importance to the development of the province. It has the Crystal Sugar Corporation with a rated capacity of 6,000 tons per day. As of 1999, the total area planted to sugarcane was 20,500 hectares, which ranked as the number one crop. Corn ranks second with 10,800 hectares planted and rice accounts for the third major crop in the municipality with the irrigated areas reaching 4,900 hectares.\n\nThe National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR) Pulangi IV Hydroelectric Plant with a rated capacity of 255 megawatts is found in Maramag. The Power Plant contributed the Mindanao Grid.\n\nIn terms of environment, the municipality plays a vital role in the protection of the Bukidnon Watershed. Thirty percent of the land, approximately 17,340 hectares, of Maramag has been designated as forest land. These include the protected forest (10.45%), production forest (85.85%) and buffer zones (3.7%). The forest area categorized under the NIPAS is the 1,939.62 hectares within the confines of Mt. Kalatungan Range, the third highest mountain of the country.\n\nMaramag, a landlocked municipality of Bukidnon, is approximately southeast of Cagayan de Oro City, around south of Malaybalay City, from Davao City and from General Santos City.\n\nIt is bounded on the north and north-eastern by the municipality of Valencia; on the east by the municipality of Quezon; on the south by the municipality of Don Carlos; and on the west by the municipality of Pangantucan, all within the Province of Bukidnon. It is located within the geographic coordinates of 7°41’, to 7°58’ North latitude and 124°47’ to 125°14’ East longitude.\n\nMaramag covers a total land area of and politically divided into 20 barangays. The largest barangay is Kuya.\n\nMaramag is bounded in the North-East by mountain ranges of Mount Kilakron and Mount Kalatungan. Among its important landmarks are the Adtuyon Plateau and the Musuan Peak, at the base of which lies the Central Mindanao University (CMU), a state university at Musuan, Barangay Dologon.\n\nThe municipality is well distributed in terms of slope gradients. The eastern and central sections of Maramag except in some patches are characteristically flat but undulated towards the northern and western boundaries of the area.\n\nAreas having slopes of 0–18 percent occupies almost half (48.84%) of the entire municipality with the 0-3% slope category accounting for 26.47 percent. Another slope category with considerable area is the 8-18% occupying around 9,014.76 hectares and comprising 17.27 percent of the total land area. The largest area in Maramag in terms of the slope grouping is the 18-30%, which comprised 27.39 percent of the land area or an equivalent area of 14,297.30 hectares. The very steep hills and mountains (50% and above in slope) in Maramag occupy only 6,566.63 or 12.58% of the total land area. These areas are located mostly in the western and northern boundaries of Maramag.\n\nBodies of water abound the area, the Baguic-ican River in the east, flowing downstream as tributary of Muleta River that drains in the South to Don Carlos; and the Maramag River whose tributaries upstream originates from the central portion of the municipality, which flows further towards the Pulangi River. Another tributary to Pulangi River that flows within the area are the Kibalagon Creek and the Kulaman River, both found in the North East.\n\nOnly Pulangi Watershed is identified to have an influence on the availability of water resources in Maramag.\n\nMaramag is composed of twenty (20) barangays, further subdivided into 204 sitios or puroks. Five (5) barangays are categorized as urban: Base Camp, Dagumba-an, Dologon, North and South Poblacions; and fifteen (15) as rural.\n\nIn the , the population of Maramag, Bukidnon, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe population in the municipality is a mixture of different tribal origins. We can observe people speaking in different dialects/languages which are an implication of being foreign or in migrant to the locality.\n\nBased from historical accounts, the original inhabitants of Maramag came from the blood of Manobos and Maranaos. Through the years, Christians or Dumagats started to come and settle in the area. Among them, Cebuano tongue predominated the place, while other majority groups find their living in all the corners of Maramag, although Lumads can still be found.\n\nAs shown in the Calendar Year 2000 Census of Population, the inhabitants of Maramag is composed of 77 carried ethnic groups. Cebuano is the dominant group among these carried ethnic groups. Other ethnic groups of higher headcount include Boholano, Hiligaynon/Ilonggo, Bukidnon, Ilocano and Tagalog.\n\nMaramag is home to inland aqua-culture hatcheries and Techno Demo Farm where agricultural technology is developed. The Dole Banana Plantation has a total area of 800 hectares. The plantation contributes to the supply of bananas exportation of the known DOLE Company.\n\nIndustries include mulberry production, mineral and purified drinking water production, and sugar processing.\n\nScreenshots Cafe which opened in 2016 provided home theater facilities, the first of its kind in Bukidnon.\n\nElectric power is generated at the Pulangi IV Hydro Electric Plant in Barangay Camp 1. With rated capacity of 255 megawatts, the power plant supplies power to various provinces of Mindanao.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe name “Pangantucan”, meaning wisdom and strength, is dedicated to a white stallion. The horse uprooted a bamboo stalk in time to warn his master, a \"datu\" of the tribe, of the impending threat of Manobo raiders, thereby saving the tribe from massacre.\n\nPangantucan was once a \"barrio\" of Maramag, and as the seat of government it was merged in 1931 with neighbouring Adtuyon, Dominorog, Panalagsagan, Kalilangan and Barandias to form a separate municipal district. It was granted Municipal status in 1961.\n\nPangantucan is one of 20 municipalities in the Province of Bukidnon. It is situated at the south–western part of the province of Bukidnon and located approximately south of Malaybalay, the capital town of Bukidnon, and is about away from Cagayan de Oro City. Wao, Lanao del Sur, can be reached through a concrete/gravel paved national road south from the municipality.\n\nThe Municipality of Pangantucan is bounded on the south-west side by the province of Lanao del Sur and by the province of North Cotabato on the southern part. The Municipality of Kalilangan lies at the western part of the municipality while on its north-west portion is the Mount Kitanglad Range. Valencia, regarded as the trade center of Bukidnon bounds Pangantucan on its northern part while Maramag and the Municipalities of Don Carlos and Kadingilan are found on its east and south side respectively.\n\nPangantucan has a land area of which is 9th largest among the 20 municipalities and two cities of the province. It composed of 19 barangays, all of which are accessible on summer days by motor vehicle fit for the bad roads.\n\nLocated in Barangay Pigtauranan are the lakes Napalit and Mata. Lake Napalit is a tectonic lake situated outside the range of Mt. Kalatungan. The lake supplies fishes like tilapia, gurami, carp, mudfish and catfish. It has an area of around 36 hectares and an estimated depth of 80 feet. According to the native folks, there used to be 24 islets floating in the lake. To date, only one islet stands. The Department of Tourism declared the lake as a natural park. Around 1 kilometer away from Lake Napalit is Lake Mata. In between the two lakes is a marsh settled with naturally bonsai-ed trees and tikog plants. Tikog is harvested, treated and processed by the women into mats, bags, placemats and other handicrafts. \n\nThe terrain of Pangantucan is characterized by slightly undulating and rolling upland areas. In fact, 62 percent of the municipal land area features rolling or hilly terrain with slopes ranging from 18 percent to 50 percent. Only about 14 percent is suitable for agricultural production. On the north-west portion of the municipality is Mount Kalatungan, the second highest peak in the province with an elevation of . Its ranges occupy about 21 percent of the municipality’s total land area.\n\nThe climate of Pangantucan is of Type IV of the Modified Corona’s Climate Classification. It is characterized by more or less evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year with rare incidence of tropical cyclone. Rainfall distribution variation (Figure 1) is influenced by rain shadow effect of the mountainous belt on the eastern side of Bukidnon and by the presence of adjoining hills and mountain ranges.\n\nBased on the data from 1995–2000, Pangantucan has an annual average rainfall of . June is the wettest month with an average rainfall of , followed by the months of August, September and July with an average rainfall of , , and respectively.

Its density was 205 persons per square kilometer. It registered a population growth of 1.64 percent based on the 1990-2007 census of population. Available data indicated that the population has steadily been increasing from 1976 up to the present. Of the total population 51.45% are male and the rest are the female population.\n\nThe Poblacion is the nucleus of growth within the municipality. It is the center of both government and commercial activities, and the site of various establishments, services, and facilities.\n\nOutside the Poblacion are the rural areas where the majority of the population reside, and whose prime economic activity is farming. Agriculture is the major land user with an aggregate are of 17,429 hectares devoted to its use. Of this area, 4,806 hectares are planted with corn and 1,121 hectares are planted with rice. Commercial/industrial and other crops account for some 11,502 hectares. \n\nBanana, pineapple, and papaya plantation also utilize vast lands in the area. Landowners rent out their lands to big companies for a contract of a period that spans 20 years. In favor of the landowners, the companies then gave them priority to work in the plantation.\n\nIn addition livestock and poultry are also major sources of livelihood in Pangantucan, Total livestock in 2002 reached 20,276. On the other hand, poultry production was reported at 56,710 for the same period.\n\nSupporting the agricultural activities in the municipality are about 74 tractors, 6 rice thresher, 97 corn shellers, 19 rice/corn mills, 6 mechanical dryers, 128 multi-purpose pavement and 5 storage/warehousing facilities.\n\nCommerce and trade play a significant role in Pangantucan economy. Some 232 commercial establishments are reported in the area of which about 4 engaged in a wholesale activity. Among such wholesale establishments include 2 branches of the BS Garces Payless Mart chain of stores – a 2-storey building within the public market-bus terminal area and a 3-storey building with a mezzanine along the main highway.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe natives of Bukidnon known as Tigwahanons and Matigsalugs were the original inhabitants of this area. They settled along the fertile river valleys of the Tigwa and Salug rivers. These people were nomadic by nature and subsisted mainly by hunting and eating forest products but they also maintained small plots of corn and root crops in places where they built their temporary shelters. They have a feudal type of government headed by a political chieftain known as “Datu”, who also acted as their religious leader and armed forces chief.\n\nThe municipality was formerly a district of the municipalities of Maramag, Dangcagan and Valencia City pursuant to Executive Order No. 347 of President Carlos P. Garcia dated July 29, 1959. During the reign of Gov. Teodoro Oblad and Cong. Cesar Fortich, a proposal was submitted to the defunct Congress for the creation of this district into municipality. On June 18, 1966, San Fernando was created into a municipality under R.A. 4789 and was named in honor of Fernando Damasco, the Father of former Gov. Catalino Damasco. The first set of government was installed at Barangay Namnam, approximately 48 kilometers away from Valencia City.\n\nThe government resettlement program for Mindanao during the 1960s and 1970s attracted immigrants from Luzon and the Visayas. The arrival of the migrants, attracted by the town's rich agricultural potential, created more settlements in the area and contributed much in the development of the area. The original occupants of the town, the Tigwahanon and the Matigsalug, were then replaced by these lowlanders or “dumagats””. Only few natives remained in the lowland and the majority of them settled in the interior and mountainous areas of the municipality.\n\nOn July 27, 1970, the municipal council passed a resolution transferring the seat of government from Namnam to Barangay Halapitan.\nHalapitan - The present town of Halapitan used to be an abaca farm of Victoriano Bantug who served as mayor in the 70's. Mr. Tamin, a teacher in Namnam used to drop by at Mr. Bantug's house in present Halapitan on his way to Malaybalay, thus the word \"Hapit\", or drop by. Talangihon which is now Comawas was the loading dock for bamboo rafts as inhabitants sail along Tigoa River connecting Pulangui River onto Lumbayao.

He wrote over 32 volumes on topics such as painting, poetics, sculpture, alchemy, medicine, logic, philosophy and tantra. Mipham's works are still central to the scholastic curriculum in Nyingma monasteries today. Mipham is also considered one of the leading figures in the Ri-me (non-sectarian) movement in Tibet.\n\n\"Ju\" (\"holding\") was Mipham's family name as his paternal clan is said to have originated as clear light deities who came to the human world holding a rope.\n\"Jamgön\" (Skt. Mañjuśrī) indicate that he was considered to be an emanation of the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī. His maternal uncle, Minister-Lama Drupchok Pema Tarjay, named him Mipham Gyamtso (\"Invincible Ocean\" or \"Unconquerable Ocean\").\nIn Tibetan literature, the word \"mi-pham\" is the standard translation of the Sanskrit \"ajita\", meaning \"unconquered\", which is a common epithet of the celestial bodhisattva Maitreya.\n\nMipham the Great was born to an aristocratic family in 1846 in the Derge Principality of Kham or Eastern Tibet. He was recognized as an exceptional child from a young age, memorizing texts as early as age six. By the age of ten he had already composed many texts. At twelve, he entered the monastery as an ordinary monk of the Ogmin Urgyen Mindrolling lineage at a branch monastery of the great Nyingma seat Shechen.\n\nWhen he was fifteen or sixteen, after studying the very difficult Mindrolling system of chanting for only a few days and praying to Manjushri, he is said to have completely mastered it. In an 18-month retreat he accomplished the form of Manjushri known as 'Lion of Philosophers' (Tibetan: smra ba'i seng ge), using a liturgy composed by the fifteenth Karmapa, Khakhyab Dorje. He made many medicinal pills blessed with Manjushri's mantra, and many miraculous signs were said to have been manifest. After this, it was said that he could accomplish any sutra or tantra without any effort, and no text was unknown to him. He went to many lamas to obtain the necessary lungs (oral transmissions), but he needed no study or teachings for any texts.\n\nMipham was \"a luminary of the nineteenth century Nyingma renaissance and Rime movement ecumenical movement, which started in the Kham region of eastern Tibet\". As such he received teachings from masters of all lineages Nyingma and Sarma alike. His root gurus were Dza Patrul Rinpoche, from whom he received instruction on Shantideva's \"Bodhicharyavatara\" and Dzogchen and the renowned master Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, from whom he received transmission of the orally transmitted or Kama and revealed or Terma lineages, and many other teachings. His other teachers included Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye; Dzogchen Khenpo Padma Vajra; Lab Kyabgon Wangchen Gyerab Dorje; Jubon Jigme Dorje; Bumsar Geshe Ngawang Jungne and Ngor Ponlop Jamyang Loter Wangpo.\n\nA key theme in Mipham's philosophical work is the unity of seemingly disparate ideas such as duality and nonduality, conceptual and nonconceptual (nirvikalpa) wisdom, rational analysis and uncontrived meditation, presence and absence, immanence and transcendence, emptiness and Buddha nature. Mimicking the Sarma schools, Mipham attempted to reconcile the view of tantra, especially Dzogchen, with sutric Madhyamaka. This was in departure with the Nyingma school which generally positioned the view of tantra as superior to the view of Madhyamaka.\n\nFor Mipam, the unity of philosophical views is ultimately resolved in the principle of coalescence (Sanskrit: \"yuganaddha\", Tib: \"zung 'jug\"), which is the nonduality of conventional and ultimate realities, of samsara and nirvana. Unlike Tsongkhapa who held that emptiness, as an absolute negation, was the definitive reality and view, Mipham sees coalescence of gnosis and emptiness, form and emptiness, etc. as \"the ultimate hermeneutical cornerstone of his interpretations\".\n\nIn his many texts Mipham explores the tension and dialectic that arises between philosophical reasoning of the ordinary mind (\"rnam shes\") which is represented by the Madhyamaka philosophy and luminous nonconceptual wisdom (\"ye shes\"), which is the focus of the teachings of Dzogchen. He attempts a synthesis of them to show that they are not incompatible perspectives and that the teachings of Dzogchen are in line with reason.\n\nMipham developed a twofold model of the Buddhist two truths doctrine. The first model is the traditional Madhyamaka perspective which presents the two truths of emptiness and appearance, with emptiness representing the level of ultimate truth and appearance representing relative truth. In this model the two truths are really the same reality and are only conceptually distinct.\n\nIn his second model of the two truths, Mipham presents an authentic truth and an inauthentic truth. Authentic experience is any perception that is in accord with reality (\"gnas snang mthun\") and perceptions which do not are said to be inauthentic. This differs from the first model because in the first model only emptiness is ultimate while in the second model the ultimate truth is the meditative experience of unitary wisdom. Instead of just being a negation, it includes the subjective content of the cognition of wisdom as well as the objective nature of reality. In this model the ultimate truth is also reality experienced nonconceptually, without duality and reification, which in Dzogchen is termed rigpa, while the relative truth is the conceptual mind (\"sems\").\n\nAccording to Mipham these two models do not conflict. They are merely different contextually; the first relates to the analysis of experience post meditatively and the second corresponds to the experience of unity in meditative equipose. This synthesis by Mipam is ultimately a bringing together of two different perspectives in Tibetan philosophy, rangtong and shentong, which Mipam associated with the teachings of the second turning (Prajnaparamita sutras) and third turning (Yogacara and Buddha nature sutras) respectively:\n\nThe emptiness taught in the middle wheel and the exalted body and wisdom taught in the last wheel should be integrated as a unity of emptiness and appearance. Without dividing or excluding the definitive meaning subject matters of the middle and last wheels, both should be held to be the definitive meaning in the way of just this assertion by the omniscient Longchen Rapjam. - \"Lion's Roar, exposition of Buddha nature\".\n\nFor Mipham, both of these teachings are definitive and a middle way between both of them is the best way to avoid the extremes of nihilism and essentialism.\n\nAnother original contribution of Mipham is his system of fourfold valid cognition (pramana) which has two conventional and two ultimate valid cognitions:\n\nConventional valid cognitions\n\nUltimate valid cognitions\n\nAs scholar Robert Mayer remarks, Mipham \"completely revolutionised rNying ma pa scholasticism in the late 19th century, raising its status after many centuries as a comparative intellectual backwater, to arguably the most dynamic and expansive of philosophical traditions in all of Tibetan Buddhism, with an influence and impact far beyond the rNying ma pa themselves.\"\n\nIn the Introduction to his critical study of the ontological debates between Mipham and his Gelugpa opponents (\"Mipham's Dialectics and the Debates on Emptiness\") Lopon Karma Phuntsho defines Mipham as a polymath and gives this assessment of the scope of Mipham's work:\n\nMipham's works on both the exoteric or Sutrayana teachings and the esoteric or Vajrayāna teachings have become core texts within the Nyingma tradition. These works now hold a central position in the curriculum of all Nyingma monasteries and monastic colleges — occupying a place of esteem similar to the works of Sakya Pandita and Gorampa in the Sakya tradition; those of Tsongkhapa in the Gelug tradition and of Kunkhyen Padma Karpo in the Drukpa Kagyu. Together with Rongzompa and Longchenpa, Mipham is considered to be one of the three \"omniscient\" writers of the Nyingma tradition.\n\nAlthough Mipham wrote on a wide range of subjects, Prof. David Germano identifies the most influential aspect of Mipham's career in that he \"was the single most important author in the efflorescence of Nyingma exoteric literature in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Grounding himself theoretically in the writings of Longchenpa and other great Nyingma authors, Mipham produced brilliant exegetical commentaries on the great Indian philosophical systems and texts with a Nyingma orientation.\".\n\nE. Gene Smith also judged that Mipham's greatest contribution was \"in his brilliant and strikingly original commentaries on the Indian treatises.\" Prior to Mipham, Nyingmapa scholars \"had seldom written detailed pedagogical commentaries on the \"śāstras\" of exoteric Buddhism.\" Until his time the colleges or shedra associated with the great Nyingma monasteries of Kham, such as Dzogchen, Shechen, Kathog, Palyul and Tarthang lacked their own exegetical commentaries on these exoteric Mahayana \"śāstras\", and students commonly studied Gelug commentaries on these fundamental texts. Grounding himself in the writings of Śāntarakṣita, Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo, and Longchenpa, Mipham produced a whole array of brilliant exegetical commentaries on the great Indian philosophical systems and texts that clearly articulated a Nyingma orientation or view.\n\nThe texts include his commentaries on the \"Mulamadhyamakakarika\" or \"Fundamental Stanzas on Wisdom\" by Nagarjuna; the \"Introduction to the Middle Way\" (Sanskrit: Madhyamakāvatāra) of Chandrakirti; the \"Quintessence of all Courses of Ultimate Wisdom\" (Jnanasarasamuccaya) of Aryadeva; commentaries on the major works of the Indian Buddhist logicians Dharmakirti and Dignaga; commentaries on the \"Five Treatises of Maitreya\" most notably, the \"Abhisamayalamkara\"; commentaries on several works of Vasubandhu including the \"Abhidharmakosha\". Mipham's commentary on the ninth chapter of Shantideva's \"Bodhicaryavatara, \" the \"Shertik Norbu Ketaka\" (), \"threw Tibetan scholarly circles into several decades of heated controversy,\" but \"it was not the only tempest Mipham's new expositions raised.\" His commentary on the \"Madhyamakalamkara\" of Śāntarakṣita was also considered highly controversial.\n\nMipham's commentary on the Guhyagarbha Tantra is entitled \"The Essence of Clear Light\" or \"Nucleus of Inner Radiance\" ()— it is based on Longchenpa's commentary,\" Dispelling Darkness in the Ten Directions\" which explains the Guhyagarbha from the Dzogchen point of view.\n\nMipham showed particular interest in the Kalachakra and the kingdom of Shambhala, and one of his last and most extensive of his esoteric works are his two volumes of commentary, initiation and sadhana related to the Kalachakra Tantra, the esoteric teaching from Shambhala. Before he died in 1912, he said to his students that now he was going to Shambhala.\n\nThroughout his life, Mipham showed a particular interest in the legend of the warrior king Gesar of Ling, a 12th-century figure whose epic is well-known and widely celebrated in eastern Tibet, and about whom Mipham wrote extensively.\n\nThe Gesar practice, known as \"The Swift Accomplishment of Enlightened Activity Through Invocation and Offering\" () arose in the mind of Mipham as a gong-ter and was written down over the course of 3 years from the age of 31 to 34. This practice invokes Gesar and his retinue and requests him to assist practitioners.\n\nMipham's medical works continue to be highly regarded to this day.\nMipham also wrote extensively about astrology which was, in his words, a \"delightful game\" that he mastered in his teens but later applied to more serious topics such as medicine; these two topics, with various texts on more or less related topics of divination, occupy perhaps 2,000 pages of his writing. An entire volume of Mipham's is devoted to Ju-thig or divination using knots, a method that might be termed \"Bon\" in origin, for want of a more accurate term; this may have been the legacy of his family, who were doctors for several generations. Throughout his writings there are many resources for divination, in addition to astrology, including several rituals for looking in mirrors (pra-mo), one using dice (mo), pulling different-length 'arrows' (Wylie: da dar) out of a quiver and so on, compelling a non-human \"bird\" to whisper future news in one's ear, and so on. In one short text he prescribes various methods of divination (all drawn, Mipham emphasizes, from Tantric scriptures and commentaries) that make use of unusual sources of augury such as: the vicariously overheard chatter of women; sudden appearance of various animals, especially birds; weather phenomena; the shape, size and color of flames in the agnihotra or fire puja; the quality of burning butter lamps, especially the size of the flame, the amount and shape of smoke that arises; and the size and shape of the carbon deposit on the wick.\n\nWhen some of his scholarly rivals thought it inappropriate for a monk to devote so much time to matters of future events, Mipham wrote a short essay explaining the purpose of divination, citing sources in the Sutras and Tantras where the utility and value of divination are explained.\n\nMipham’s most important students were Dodrub Rinpoche, Terton Sogyal, the Fifth Dzogchen Rinpoche, Gemang Kyab Gon, Khenpo Padmavajra, Katog Situ Rinpoche, Sechen Rabjam, Gyaltsab Tulku, Palyul Gyaltrul, Karma Yangtrul, Palpung Situ Rinpoche, Ling Jetrung, Adzom Drukpa (1842-1924), Togdan Shakya Shri, Ngor Ponlob, and others. The great tulkus of Sechen, Dzogchen, Katog, Palyul, Palpung, Dege Gonchen, Repkong and others of all lineages, Sakya, Gelug, Kagyu, and Nyingma, all became his disciples.\n\nAccording to one account shortly before he died, Mipham told his attendant:\n\nThis may be interpreted as a statement that his mindstream would have no further 'emanations' (Wylie: \"sprul pa\" (tulpa); \"sprul sku\" (tulku)). Conversely, according to another account in which he mentions the mindstream in passing and prophesies the shortly before his death to his student Khenpo Kunphel:\n\nIn the above account, shortly after the departure of Khenpo Kunphel he stated publicly, \"Now, soon I shall depart. I shall not be reborn again in Tibet, therefore do not search for me. I have reason to go to Shambhala in the north.\"\n\nSubsequently, a number of emanations have been recognized.\n\nAccording to E. Gene Smith \"At least three rebirths were recognized in the decade following his death: 1) Zhe chen Mi pham (a grandnephew of Mi pham rgya mtsho); 2) Tshe dbang bdud 'dul (1915/16-42) the last prince of Sde dge; 3. Khyung po Mi pham, an incarnation recognized by Rdzong gsar Mkhyen brtse 'Jam dbyangs chos kyi blo gros.\"\n\nThe next (third) Mipham in the line of the Dege Prince who died in 1942 was apparently born in Tibet in 1949 and recognised by Tengye Rinpoche of Lab i 1959 At that time he was enthroned and given responsibility for all monasteries previously held by the first and second incarnations. This third incarnation was also confirmed by Patrul Rinpoche who gave him relics of the previous incarnations and by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, who he had recognized in a previous incarnation. This Mipham incarnate is the father of Thaye Dorje, one of two candidates to be recognized as the 17th Karmapa, and of 14th Sonam Tsemo Rinpoche, an important Gelug/Sakya tulku.\nIn 1995, Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo (b. 1962), the eldest son of renowned dharma master Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche and Ani Könchok Palden, was recognized as a reincarnation of Mipham Rinpoche by HH Drubwang Padma Norbu Rinpoche, at the time the head of the Nyingma lineage. He is now known as Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, and is the spiritual head of Shambhala International.\n\n\nIn contemporary scholarship, the nomenclature \"Mi-pam\" and \"Mipam\" has become an accepted alternative. Writers such as Hopkins and Duckworth have adopted this convention (see below).\n\nFor an excellent guide to his works in English, see the Great Masters Series article from Shambhala Publications\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe word “Sumilao” came from a Bukidnon phrase \"\"Kon sumilaw da\"”, which means “When light comes again.”\n\nA story has been told that there lived a man named Walu who possessed supernatural powers. Many believed that he lives somewhere in Kilabong a place near Palaopao Hill. Time came when seven \"“baylan”\" (spiritual leaders who possessed special powers) who were living at the plain below fabricated degrading stories against Walu.\n\nThis angered him. Standing on the hill, he shouted at the top of his voice and pointed to the seven men rebuking them for their evil intentions. At this instant, bright, glaring light emitted from the tip of the pointing finger and the seven \"“baylan”\" were blinded. It was said that their eyesight will be restored when the same light will come again.\n\nOral history from the town’s old-time residents stated that before the Spanish colonization, the present site of the Poblacion was already inhabited. Four big buildings housing several families were already constructed. These families were directly controlled by a settlement datu or chief. They have grouped together to protect themselves from the fierce \"“mangangayaw”\" or headhunters from the hills.\n\nWhen the Spaniards came, Datu Manlomero and Opecio, with their men, fought against the invading \"conquistadores\". Unfortunately, the natives were defeated due to the inferiority of their weapons.\n\nSo they laid down their arms and accepted the new ruler. They were baptized to the Christian religion. In the 1860s, the Recollect missionaries were already making visits to Sumilao.\n\nWhen the Jesuit priests took over the missionary work in Bukidnon in the 1870s, Sumilao was already one of the \"rancherias\" of the Visita of Tagoloan. Regular missionary trips to Sumilao and Linabo were intensified by Fathers Juan Terricarbas and Eusebio Barrado. By 1887, there were 200 Christian residents of the Rancheria de Sumilao.\n\nIn January 1890, Sumilao was created into the first active mission station in Bukidnon, thus making her the nucleus of the Roman Catholic faith in the province. Mission de Sumilao assumed jurisdiction over the \"rancherias\" of Tagoloan up to Bugcaon, formerly all under the parish of Tagoloan.\n\nSumilao was now under the Residencia de Balingasag. The name \"rancheria\" was later changed to reduccion de Nuevo Cristianos. By 1891, Mission de Sumilao had 15 \"reducciones\" with a combined Christian population of 8, 399. The reduccion of Sumilao, however had 11, 340 inhabitants. Father Eusebio Barrado was the missionary curate during that time.\n\nIn 1893, Mission de Mailag (Mailag) was created. This reduced the number of \"reducciones\" of Mission de Sumilao. By 1894, the mission had only 4, 122 Christian inhabitants.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonizations, the local datu were appointed to political positions by the missionary priests. These political leaders were under the administrative control of the higher authorities who are stationed at Misamis Oriental. Some of these local leaders were Capitanes Dalahigon, Alejo Yansao – alis Mandita, Akuman and Tao.\n\nIn 1907, the American took over the administration of Bukidnon. The town’s chief was now called \"president\". In 1914, Sumilao was one of the communities created into municipal districts of Bukidnon pursuant to Executive Order No. 10 issued by Frank Carpenter, Governor of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu on August 15, 1914.\n\nIt was also during the American regime that a parochial school known as Little Flower Academy flourished. Its operation, however, lasted only up to the outbreak of World War II. The Catholic Church and the school building were bombed by the American fighter planes in 1944.\n\nMr. Juan Sumbalan was the president sometime in the 1920s up to the outbreak of the war. Under the Japanese military government, Mr, Restituto Parista was appointed as the town’s chief.\n\nDuring the war, several young and brave men of Sumilao joined the guerilla resistance movement. Some of these men were Lieutenants Candido G. Sumbalan and Alejandro Sale.\n\nWhen liberation came, Mr, Juan Sumbalan, who returned to power, ordered some of his men to settle in Kisolon to protect themselves from the Japanese stragglers who were still roaming in the vicinity of Poblacion, Sumilao. Kisolon which was then a part of Impasugong, was formerly a ranch owned by a certain Guingona.\n\nWhen Mr. Juan Sumbalan died in 1945, Mr. Restituto Parista was appointed to the vacated position. In 1953, Mr, Martin Langue replaced Mr. Parista. However, he did not stay long for on that same year, Mr. Candido G. Sumbalan was appointed Mayor by Provincial Governor Marcus A. Reciña.\n\nAlthough Sumilao was one of the early missionary centers of Bukidnon, its economic and political growth was quite slow. This could be attested by the fact that by 1917, four municipal districts of the province were organized into regular municipalities. These municipalities have bigger populations and their leaders were politically prepared to administer the affairs of their respective municipalities. Population conducted during the period of 1918-1948 showed that Sumilao has the lowest number of inhabitants compared to the other municipal districts. It has only one barangay in the 1900s (Barangay Puntian).\n\nSumilao became a regular municipality on July 1, 1956 pursuant to Executive Order No. 272 signed by the President Carlos P. Garcia. The following were the elected and appointed officials of the municipality from its establishment up to the present.\n\nOn December 3, 2007, 55 farmers of the Higaonon tribe from Sumilao arrived in Metro Manila, 2 months after their march through 13 provinces from Mindanao to ask the government to stop the conversion of the land they are claiming into a hog farm. They farmers petitioned the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to issue a cease-and-desist order (CDO) on the contested 144-hectare property in Barangay (village) San Vicente, Sumilao which San Miguel Foods Inc. (SMFI) converted into a hog farm. The Supreme Court of the Philippines had earlier dismissed the farmers' rights lack of legal standing. Farmer Tuminhay stated that: “Our titles were cancelled because Norberto Quisumbing was allowed to convert his land on condition that he would implement a five-year development plan. Since he did not implement the plan, it is only proper that DAR renew the CARP process and give us back our titles.” Quisumbing's development plan for the property included the establishment of a development academy, a cultural center, an institute for livelihood science, a museum, library, golf course, a sports development complex, an agro-industrial park, forest development and support facilities, and construction of a 360-room hotel, restaurant, housing projects, inter alia.\n\nOn December 17, 2007, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo revoked the conversion order on the disputed 144-hectare lot in Sumilao, resulting to the return of the land ownership to the 55 members of the Higaonon tribe farmers who marched 1,700 kilometers for 2 months from Mindanao to Metro Manila. The order, signed by Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita, reads: “Wherefore premises considered and as recommended by DAR, the petition for cancellation and/or revocation of the conversion order covering 144 hectares of land…is hereby granted.” San Miguel Foods as landowner must be paid the current value of the property before the land can be distributed to the farmers.\n\nIn March 2008, San Miguel and the Sumilao farmers signed a deal giving 50 hectares to the farmers. The farmers will get a total of 144 hectares, which is equivalent in size of the original property they sought for.\n\nSumilao is one of the 20 municipalities of Bukidnon. It is located between latitudes 8 degrees, 11 seconds and 8 degrees, 12 seconds North and longitudes 124 degrees, 52 seconds and 125 degrees and 2 seconds East. It is bounded in the east by the Municipality of Impasugong, in the south by the municipalities of Baungon and Libona and in the north by the Municipality of Manolo Fortich.\n\nIt is particularly bounded in the east by the town of Impasugong, south by Lantapan and Talakag, west and north by Manolo Fortich.\n\nTen barangays comprise the municipality with Kisolon as the seat of government. It occupies an aggregate land area of 20, 445 hectares. Sumilao is traversed by the deep Kulaman Canyon which physically separates six barangays from the Poblacion and Kisolon.\n\nSumilao is approximately 62 kilometers from Cagayan de Oro City and 29 kilometers from the provincial capital, the City of Malaybalay. It is situated between the two growth centers of the province, Manolo Fortich and the City of Malaybalay. It is accessible by land transportation and vehicles plying the Cagayan de Oro City and Malaybalay/Valencia routes passing through the eight kilometer stretch of the National Sayre Highway, which traverses the municipality's area.\n\nSumilao has an aggregate land area of is 207.49 km² representing 2.4% of the total land area of the province. Its participation in the region is 0.7212. Of the ten barangays, Lupiagan has the largest area accounting to about 29.18% of the total land area. San Vicente is the smallest with 8.54 km² or 4.14% of the total land area.\n\nThe Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) data revealed that the information on Sumilao's total land area which is 207.49 km² can be classified as: 155.92 km² are considered alienable and disposable and 51.57 km² of which are forestal/timberland.\n\nGenerally, Sumilao's physical configuration is characterized by extreme features. From the south to the central portion moving towards the north and north-western areas are mountain ranges, canyons, and high relief topography, including part of Mt. Kitanglad, the second highest mountain peak in the Philippines, and the Palaopao Mountains. In the Upper Kulaman areas, settlements sprawl between the vast stretches of pineapple plantations. Per topographic map of the municipality from NAMRIA, the average elevation of Sumilao is 600 meters above sea level.\n\nBukidnon province has two prevailing climate variations based on rainfall pattern existing in its northern and southern sections. The northern part where Sumilao is located falls under the third or intermediate A type. Under this type, seasons are not very pronounced; relatively dry from November to April and wet for the rest of the year, maximum rain period is not very pronounced. Specifically, the climate in the southern part of the municipality is relatively cool and humid throughout the year. These areas are along the foot of the Mt. Kitanglad while in the northern areas, rainfall is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. Most often in these areas, heavy downpour occurs every afternoon while in the morning the sun shines. The average heaviest rainfall for the past five years occurs in June with 431.7 millimeters and the lowest in March with only 89.2 millimeters.\n\nSumilao is politically subdivided into ten (10) barangays, six of which are traversed by the Kulaman River that separate them from the other four barangays. The ten barangays are Kisolon, Kulasi, Licoan, Lupiagan, Occasion, Poblacion, Puntian, San Roque, San Vicente and Vista Villa. Unlike any other municipalities, the seat of government in Sumilao is located at barangay Kisolon; Barangay Poblacion serves as a satellite barangay for other rural barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Sumilao, Bukidnon, was people, with a density of .\n\nSumilao had the lowest population in the census year 1990 and second lowest in 1995, among the 21 municipalities. However, as for population growth, it ranks the highest percent increase of 18.90% with an increase population of 2,146 between 1990 and 1995. On the census conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority on the year 2000, the population of Sumilao increased to 17,958 brought about by in-migration of agro-industrial workers from the neighboring towns of Manolo Fortich, Impasugong, Malaybalay City and from the provinces of Misamis Oriental, Misamis Occidental, Camiguin, Bohol and other places in Luzon.\n\nThe urban barangay of Kisolon and the two urbanizable barangays of San Vicente and Poblacion and one rural barangay of Vista Villa have a density of 160 people/km². The density appears very good and ideal noting the density against the census of 10,000 people/km².\n\nSumilao is basically an agriculture-based community where most of the populace are dependents on agriculture as its main economic activity and as source of main income. Ordinary farmers are planting rice, corn and vegetables both traditional and high value crops while the large corporations, the DOLE Philippines-Skyland Division and the De Monte Philippines, Inc. are engaged in planting commercial crops of sweet lakatan variety banana and pineapple. There is also an influx of agro-industrial establishment in the area, the piggery and breeder farms but required a minimal employment only. The municipality boost of its natural and man-made attractions which when developed can be a source of income for the populace. Small cottage industries like broom making made of guiyong, ceramics and pot made of clay and hollow blocks making are gaining headway in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth as a devolved function, the Municipal Government through the Local Health Board and the Municipal Health Office, has given priority on health related programs. Crude birth rates and crude death rates are maintained and improved through the implementation of programs and projects of health. The Municipal Health Office of Sumilao was renovated and a Philhealth station was constructed adjacent to it manned by the personnel from the Provincial Government under the Provincial Indigency Health Program of Jose Ma. R. Zubiri, Jr. The Municipal Health Office is manned by the designated Officer-in-Charge who is at the same time its medical technologist, including other personnel like the DOH representative, public health nurse, rural sanitary inspector and midwives with the Barangay Health Workers and trained hilots as extension workers. The functions of the OIC of the said office are only focused on signing Daily Time Records, payrolls, communication representing head of office and other administrative functions but not on signing death certificates, medico legal and all claims which are referred to the Provincial Health Office in Malaybalay City.\n\n"}
{"id": "2137581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2137581", "title": "Talakag", "text": "Talakag\n\n', officially the ', is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is located on the border to major cities of Cagayan De Oro and Iligan, and between Marawi City and Malaybalay, the provincial capital.\n\nOnce in the not so distant past, a nomadic tribe wandered down south. Finally, they settled upon a place attuned to their needs and liking. The place, was traversed by a zigzagging creek swollen with clear sparkling water where on its banks grew in abundance wild Malayan trees called “Balangas” (now popularly known as Rambutan – Nephelium lappaceum of the Family: Sapindaceae). The trees were full of attractive bloody red but juicy and delicious fruits, clustered in their very green foliages. Because of fanatical attachment of this tribe to these balangas trees, they decided to name their settlement “Kabalangasan” - a very typical way of simply affixing prefixes. This is the original name of the municipality of Talakag.\n\nHowever, names of places are, often, influenced and affected by events that revolve around it. History goes that aside from this Kabalangasan settlement, there was another settlement further down south called “Dagundalahon”. At first, tribes of both settlements were very friendly and cordial to each other. They would hold social gatherings, \"Kaamulan\" and 'Kaliga\" and other forms of intimate social merry-makings to satisfy their whims and caprices often with paganic undertones.\n\nThis relationship did not last long. A serious breakdown developed and as a consequence, they became bitter enemies. The root cause was the intense rivalry of men/warriors over beautiful and alluring women from either side. This resulted and accounted for ambush, kidnappings and to some extent even killings.\n\nIt was on the Kabalangasan side that men are more daring and aggressive. They adopted and ventured into the “go-chase-kidnap” tactics preying on the women of Dagundalahon who caught their fancy. Because of these, hill tribes in Dagundalahon side renamed “Kabalangasan” to Talakag, the etymology of which came from the Visayan dialect- LAKAG meaning \"to go after” or “follow in pursuit” and the prefix “TA” denoting “fondness in doing such”. In other words, Talakag means “fondness in giving pursuit”.\n\nThus, the settlement that was known as Kabalangasan was named Talakag while the creek traversing the place retained the name Kabalangasan.\n\nIn the late 14th Century, the seat of the highland government was established in Kinolosanglay at Tikalaan headed by Datu Man-utob, a wise and brave ruler. The Datu was described as an imposing giant of a man who has a big mole at the center of his nose bridge. His court was composed of Datu Aliga, Datu Lumbac and Datu Limbubongan (descent from Sharif Alawi). His ambassador was Datu Malinkayao, who was also called Sumagayon.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the kingdom of Datu Man-utob embraced the areas of Cosina, which was ruled by Mansalingay; Dagundalahon which was ruled by Datu Manlugwas; Langawon under the rule of Datu Mantingal; Landang, ruled by Datu Mancabo; Alanib ( now of Lantapan, Bukidnon) under the rules of Datu Malongmong and Datu Manbailana; Mandugao and Salagapon, which was ruled by Datu Tomopa; Tapagkal, ( now of Pangantukan, Bukidnon) ruled by Datu Magayao, Datu Maka-andig, Datu Dupao and Datu Miaday; Damulog which was ruled by Datu Labawan, who was also called Maganuna; Macahambus which was ruled by Datu Manpaklawan; and Tumalaung, which was ruled by Datu Mambalintas and Datu Manbalagon.\n\nDatu Man-utob was such a respected ruler that all the datus under him were all in awe of him. Even the Datus of Cagayhaan (now Cagayan de Oro City) ruled by Datus Abaga, Binandina and Ganza, Datus Tombalan, Mansingkatol, Manimohod, Mansihabo, Tingkayogan, Yagoma and Magoliok, all of Tagoloan and of Maguindanao and Ditsaan (now Lanao del Sur) respected and feared him.\n\nHe was so well known that even Sultan Kabungsuan (also known as Sharif Kabunsuan, the youngest brother of Sharif Alawi) and other Muslim leaders visited him at Tikalaan several times to establish good relationship during the propagation of Islam.\n\nDuring this time Mindanao, tribal wars were prevalent. The inhabitants in the coastal areas could not go up to the mountains for fear of ambush and killings; neither could the inhabitants in the mountains go to the coastal areas. Thus, in response to the request of the Muslims who were already well established in Maguindanao, Lanao, Sulu and Tagoloan, Datu Man-utob acceded to the call for peace among the rulers of Mindanao. He hosted a peace treaty at Tikalaan called \"TAMPUDA HA APAT HA PASAGI TA PUSOD TA DAGAT\" (a Binukid term meaning \"“Peace Treaty of Four Rulers in Central Mindanao”\"). The terms of the treaty was specific – to achieve peace for them to live in an atmosphere of justice and tranquility. Transgressors were dealt with accordingly. Further, intermarriages between their people were encouraged.\n\nTo mark this momentous event in history, a durian tree (Durio zibethinus – Bombacaceae) which has until very recently succumbed to old age and a species of rattan were planted and a gold cross, porcelain jars, a Koran, needles and some other items that were soaked in carabao blood were buried right on top of the spot where the treaty was held. A piece of rattan was cut into pieces and each ruler was given a portion to even make the event memorable. All of these are recorded in the \"Sil-Sila or Sal-sila\" of the Maranaos, the Skrit of the Maguindanaos and the Halads of the Higaonons.\n\nNot long after the peace treaty in Tikalaan, the Spaniards came to Cagayan de Oro to establish their seat of government. Likewise, they came to Tikalaan where they gave the reigning datu a Spanish flag and a \"cabo negro\" cane. The Spaniards were known to be suppressive to people who try to thwart their imperial rule. However the inhabitants were subservient to foreign domination, hence, there was no known occurrence of any serious trouble between them.\n\nSometime in 1902, the Americans arrived in Cagayan de Oro. The American regime encouraged the people to participate in running the government thus, in 1904 Man Sayagnon was appointed 1st Mayor of Talakag. He held office at Patpat, which is now San Isidro and his term of office expired in 1906.\n\nIn 1906, Amay Tigsay was appointed Mayor of Talakag and he continued to hold office at Patpat until 1908 where Man Sayagnon was again appointed Mayor and was in office until 1910. In 1910, Jose Levanta, son of Man Sayagnon, was elected Mayor and was in office until 1918. It was Jose Levanta, who transferred the seat of government from Patpat to the present site of the municipal government of Talakag.\n\nIn World War II, Talakag appeared to have been occupied for virtually the entire war by guerrillas opposing the Japanese occupation of Mindanao. From June 8 to 29, 1944, the Japanese attacked the area. Lieut. Col. James Grinstead had his headquarters in Talakag and before a force of 500 Japanese and Korean troops could take the town, Grinstead ordered his headquarters burned. On June 28 the Japanese-Korean force left Talakag and the guerrillas moved back into town and re-established their headquarters there.\n\nTalakag is politically subdivided into 29 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Talakag was people, with a density of .\n\n"}

Based on the Spanish novel \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, it was adapted for the screen by June Mathis. The film stars Pomeroy Cannon, Josef Swickard, Bridgetta Clark, Rudolph Valentino, Wallace Beery, and Alice Terry.\n\nOften regarded as one of the first true anti-war films, it had a huge cultural impact and became the top-grossing film of 1921, beating out Charlie Chaplin's \"The Kid\". The film turned then-little-known actor Rudolph Valentino into a superstar and associated him with the image of the Latin Lover. The film also inspired a tango craze and such fashion fads as gaucho pants. The film was written by June Mathis, who, with its success, became one of the most powerful women in Hollywood at the time.\n\nIn 1995, \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film is now in the public domain, having been made before 1923. A DVD version was released in 2000 but is now out of print. The film is now available for free download on the Internet Archive.\n\nMadariaga \"The Centaur\" (Pomeroy Cannon), a harsh but popular Argentine landowner, has a German son-in-law whom he dislikes and a French one whose family he openly favors. He is particularly fond of his grandson Julio (Rudolph Valentino), with whom he often carouses at seedy dives in the Boca district of Buenos Aires. In one of these bars, the movie's famous tango sequence occurs. A man and a woman (Beatrice Dominguez) are dancing the tango. Julio strides up and asks to cut in. The woman stares at Julio alluringly. The man brushes him off, and they resume dancing. Julio then challenges the man and strikes him, knocking him into some tables and out of the scene. Julio and the woman then dance a dramatic version of the tango that brings cheers from the people in the establishment. Following the dance, the woman sits on Julio's lap. Madariaga then slides to the floor, drunk. The woman laughs at Madariaga. Julio casts her aside in scorn and helps his grandfather home.\n\nSometime later, Madariaga dies. The extended family breaks up, one half returning to Germany and the other to France.\n\nIn Paris, Julio enjoys a somewhat shiftless life as a would-be artist and sensation at the local tea dances. He falls in love with Marguerite Laurier (Alice Terry), the unhappy and much younger wife (by an arranged marriage) of Etienne Laurier, a friend of Julio's father. The affair is discovered, and Marguerite's husband agrees to give her a divorce to avoid a scandal. It seems as though Julio and Marguerite will be able to marry, but both end up getting caught up in the start of the Great War.\n\nMarguerite becomes a nurse in Lourdes. The bravery of Etienne is reported, and he is blinded in battle. Etienne happens to end up at the hospital where she is working, and Marguerite attends to him there. Julio travels to Lourdes to see Marguerite and instead sees her taking care of Etienne. Julio, ashamed of his wastrel life, enlists in the French Army.\n\nIn the meantime, the German Army overruns Julio's father Marcelo's Marne Valley castle in the First Battle of the Marne. Marcelo is forced to host a German general and staff in the castle. One of Marcelo's three German nephews is amongst the staff and tries to protect him, but Marcelo is arrested after a melee involving an officer's assault of a woman. Marcello is to be executed in the morning, but his life is spared when the French Army counterattacks in the \"Miracle of the Marne\". The castle is destroyed by the French counterattack.\n\nFour years later Julio has survived and become renowned for his bravery in the trenches at the front. During a mission in no man's land, he encounters his last surviving German cousin. Moments later, they are both killed by a shell. Back in Paris, Marguerite considers abandoning the blinded Etienne, but Julio's ghost guides her to continue her care for him.\n\nThe ending scene shows Marcelo Desnoyers mourning over his son's grave. The man who lived upstairs from Julio watches over him. Marcelo asks him, \"Did you know my son?\" The man, with a remorseful expression, lifts his arms, forming the shape of a cross with his body, and says \"I knew them all!\" He then points to the sky and shows Marcelo the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse riding away into the clouds. With this, the man assures him that \"Peace has come—but the Four Horsemen will still ravage humanity—stirring unrest in the world—until all hatred is dead and only love reigns in the heart of mankind.\"\n\nIn 1919, screenwriter June Mathis became head of the scenario department for Metro Pictures. With this position, she became one of the first female executives in film history. Holding a major belief in Spiritualism and the Book of Revelation, Mathis was determined to turn Vicente Blasco Ibáñez's novel \"The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse\" into a film. The book had been a best seller, but most studios found it impossible to adapt to film.\n\nMathis's adaptation so impressed the studio, they asked for her input in director and star. For director, she chose Rex Ingram, who would clash with both her and Valentino. Mathis had seen a young actor named Rudolph Valentino in a bit part of a Clara Kimball Young film, \"Eyes of Youth\", in 1919. Valentino had arrived in Hollywood in 1918, where he had worked in many B movies, including \"All Night\" with Carmel Myers and \"The Delicious Little Devil\" with Mae Murray. He also worked on a picture with Julian Eltinge and Virginia Rappe that would eventually become \"The Isle of Love\". It has been suggested Mathis might have first seen him in that film, as she was a close friend of Eltinge.\n\nMathis insisted Valentino would play Julio; however, studio executives were nervous with the young actor. Valentino, whose parents were French and Italian, had a distinctly Latin look that had not been used much in pictures at that time. However, Mathis got her way, and after seeing the rushes, she and Ingram decided to expand the role of Julio to showcase the talents of Valentino. Valentino had worked as a taxi dancer during his time in New York. To show off his dancing skills, the tango scene was included, though it was not part of the original story.\nAlice Terry was cast as Julio's lover, Marguerite. She would marry Ingram that same year.\n\nMetro paid Ibanez $20,000 and 10% of the gross earnings for the rights to adapt his novel. The film took six months to shoot, cost $80,000, and had a cast of 72 \"principal players\". Valentino was only paid $350 a week, which was much less than other players. To add to his troubles, he also had to provide his own costumes, which he spent thousands on. The French Marne village was constructed at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California. In the scenes between Julio and Marguerite, Valentino and Terry spoke French to impress lip readers. Valentino was fluent in French, as his mother was French.\n\nMathis also injected some early depictions of alternative lifestyles; it featured a scene with German officers coming down the stairs in drag. Of the scene, Mathis would later tell the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"I had the German officers coming down the stairs with women's clothing on. To hundreds of people that meant no more than a masquerade party. To those who have lived and read, and who understand life, that scene stood out as one of the most terrific things in the picture.\"\n\nThe film premiered in New York to great critical acclaim. Many critics hailed it as a new \"Birth of a Nation\". However, the German press was less enthused with the portrayal of Germans in the film.\n\nThe film became a commercial success as well, and was one of the first films to make $1,000,000 at the box office. The film is considered to be the sixth-best-selling silent film of all time. During its initial run, it grossed $4,500,000 domestically.\n\nWith its extended scenes of the devastated French countryside and personalized story of loss, \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" is often considered to be one of the first anti-war films made.\n\nSome aspects of the film were controversial with American film censorship boards. For example, the Pennsylvania board, upon reviewing the affair between Julio and Marguerite, required that Marguerite be described in intertitles as being the fiancée of Etienne Laurier rather than his wife.\n\n\"Picture-Play Magazine\" reviewed \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" in their April 1921 issue, saying \"\"The Four Horsemen\" may have been a spectacular and million-dollar flivver. As it is, it is an artistic triumph.\" They also praised the cast. \"Rudolph Valentino plays the role of Julio Desnoyers. He is such a fine actor that you forget how handsome he is and how well he dances. Alice Terry as Marguerite looks and acts like another Blanche Sweet. In plain and simple words, the cast is a wonder.\"\n\nThe film made Mathis one of the most powerful and respected women in Hollywood, said to be only second to Mary Pickford. She was one of the highest-paid executives of her time and went on to work with Famous Players-Lasky and Goldwyn Pictures. She became known for her association with Valentino, who became a close friend. She wrote many more films for him, helping to shape his image.\n\nJulio proved to be a breakthrough role for Valentino, who became a superstar overnight. He became heavily associated with the image of a \"Latin lover\", though eventually his image as \"The Sheik\" may have overshadowed this. Metro refused to acknowledge that they had made a star and immediately put him into a B-picture titled \"Uncharted Seas\". Valentino soon left them for Famous Players-Lasky.\n\nThe film also helped launch the name of Ingram. Ingram came to resent the break-out success of Valentino, as he felt it was his own work that made \"Four Horsemen\" a success. He went on to make films with Terry and eventually discovered Ramon Novarro, whom he promoted as the new Valentino and who appeared as an extra in this film.\n\nThe film was remade as \"The 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" (1962), with the setting changed to World War II. Vincente Minnelli was the director.\n\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

Such competition rules are still used in the competitions held annually between the seven former Imperial universities. Similarly, there has been a resurgence in interest in Kosen judo in recent years due to its similarities with Brazilian jiu jitsu.\n\n is an abbreviation of , literally 'higher speciality school', and refers to the colleges of technology in Japan that cater for students from age 15 to 20. The kosen schools started holding judo competitions in 1898, four years after their opening, and they hosted an annual event of inter-collegiate competitions called from 1914 to 1944.\n\nThe rules of a kosen judo match were mainly the ones codified by the Dai Nippon Butokukai and Kodokan school prior to 1925 changes. However, they differed in that they asserted the right of competitors to enter groundwork however they wished and to remain in it as long as they wanted, as well as perform certain techniques which were forbidden in regular competition. Naturally, this kind of rules allowed to discard tachi-waza and adopt a more tactical style of ne-waza, which was developed profusely under the influence of judoka like Tsunetane Oda and Yaichihyōe Kanemitsu.\n\nIt is believed that the popularity of those strategies was the reason why Kodokan changed its competitive ruleset, restricting ground fighting and entries in 1925 and replacing draws for decision victories or \"yusei-gachi\" in 1929. Jigoro Kano was reportedly unsatisfied with kosen rules, and was quoted in 1926 as believing that kosen judo contributed to create judokas more proficient at winning sport matches at the cost of being less skilled at self-defense. Despite his posture, the kosen movement continued on, having barely changed its rules through all its story.\n\nIn 1950, the \"kōtō senmon gakkō\" school system was abolished as a consequence of education reforms, but the kosen ruleset was adopted by the universities of Tokyo, Kyoto, Tohoku, Kyushu, Hokkaido, Osaka and Nagoya, collectively known as Seven Imperial Universities. They hosted the first inter-collegiate competition, , in 1952, giving birth to another annual tradition. The Tokyo University abandoned the Nanatei league in 1991 in order to focus on regular judo, but it was reincorporated in 2001.\n\nThe Kyoto region is particularly notable on the kosen judo scene, having schools entirely specialized on this style until around 1940. Among the seven universities, Kyoto has the highest number of victories at the Nanatei league, counting 22 wins and 3 draws (against Nagoya in 1982 and Tohoku in 1982 and 1983) out of the 66 editions celebrated as of 2017.\n\nUnlike mainstream Kodokan competition rules, kosen rules allow , enabling competitors to transition to ne-waza by dragging their opponent down without using a recognised nage-waza technique (analogous to pulling-guard). It is also allowed to remain on the ground as much time as it is necessary, regardless of the contenders' activity. The judoka can grab his opponent as he wants, including at the legs and trousers, and there is no restriction on defensive posture. Techniques like neck cranks and leglocks were legal (excluding ashi garami, which was still a forbidden technique or kinshi-waza), though only until 1925. Finally, winning can only be accomplished by ippon, being the only alternative a \"hikiwake\" or technical draw at the referee's discretion.\n\nThe matches are contested on a mat 20×20 meters in total size. A starting zone 8x8 meters was marked on the mat as well as a danger zone which ended at 16×16 meters. If a judoka went out of the danger zone the match would be restarted. If they were actively engaged in newaza the referee would call \"sono-mama\" to freeze them into position, drag them to the middle of the competition area, and call \"yoshi\" to restart the match in the same situation. This device was common in judo in general and is still part of the official judo rules, addressed in article 18, but has since fallen into disuse, allowing modern judoka to escape newaza by going out of the competition zone.\n\nAt the Nanatei Judo league, universities face off in teams of 20 judoka of any weight class: 13 of ordinary contenders, a captain and a vice-captain, and five replacements in case of injuries or retirements. Every match is composed of a single, six-minute round, changed to an eight minute round when the contenders are captains or vice-captains. The league is hosted as a \"kachi-nuki shiai\", meaning every winner stays on the mat to face the next member of the rival team. At the end of the event, victory is given to the team with the highest numbers of matches won or with the last man on the field.\n\n\n"}

Quantum programming languages help express quantum algorithms using high-level constructs.\n\nQuantum instruction sets are used to turn higher level algorithms into physical instructions that can be executed on quantum processors. Sometimes these instructions are specific to a given hardware platform, e.g. ion traps or superconducting qubits.\n\ncQASM, also known as common QASM, is a hardware-agnostic QASM which guarantees the interoperability between all the quantum compilation and simulation tools. It was introduced by the QCA Lab at TUDelft.\n\nQuil is an instruction set architecture for quantum computing that first introduced a shared quantum/classical memory model. It was introduced by Robert Smith, Michael Curtis, and William Zeng in \"A Practical Quantum Instruction Set Architecture\". Many quantum algorithms (including quantum teleportation, quantum error correction, simulation, and optimization algorithms) require a shared memory architecture.\n\nOpenQASM is the intermediate representation introduced by IBM for use with Qiskit and the IBM Q Experience.\n\nBlackbird is a quantum instruction set and intermediate representation used by Xanadu and Strawberry Fields. It is designed to represent continuous-variable quantum programs that can run on photonic quantum hardware.\n\nQuantum software development kits provide collections of tools to create and manipulate quantum programs. They also provide the means to simulate the quantum programs , or prepare them to be run using cloud-based quantum devices.\n\nThe following software development kits can be used to run quantum circuits on prototype quantum devices, as well as on simulators.\n\nOcean\n\nAn Open Source suite of tools developed by D-Wave. Written mostly in the Python programming language, it enables users to formulate problems in Ising Model and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formats (QUBO).

Results are obtained either using a simulator, or by sending jobs to IBM quantum devices.\n\nAn Open Source project developed by IBM. Quantum circuits are created and manipulated using Python, Swift or Java. Results are obtained either using simulators that run on the user's own device, simulators provided by IBM or prototype quantum devices provided by IBM. As well as the ability to create programs using basic quantum operations, higher level algorithms are available within the Qiskit Aqua package. Qiskit is based on the OpenQASM standard for representing quantum circuits, and will support pulse level control of quantum systems as specified by the OpenPulse standard.\n\nAn Open Source project developed by Rigetti, which uses the Python programming language to create and manipulate quantum circuits.

Three simulators are provided - one in the Fock basis, one using the Gaussian formulation of quantum optics, and one using the TensorFlow machine learning library.\n\nThere are two main groups of quantum programming languages: imperative quantum programming languages and functional quantum programming languages.\n\nThe most prominent representatives of the imperative languages are QCL, LanQ and Q|SI>.\n\nQuantum Computation Language (QCL) is one of the first implemented quantum programming languages. The most important feature of QCL is the support for user-defined operators and functions. Its syntax resembles the syntax of the C programming language and its classical data types are similar to primitive data types in C. One can combine classical code and quantum code in the same program.\n\nQuantum pseudocode proposed by E. Knill is the first formalized language for description of quantum algorithms. It was introduced and, moreover, was tightly connected with a model of quantum machine called Quantum Random Access Machine (QRAM).\n\nA language developed by Microsoft to be used with the Quantum Development Kit.\n\nQ|SI> is a platform embedded in .Net language supporting quantum programming in a quantum extension of while-language. This platform includes a compiler of the quantum while-language and a chain of tools for the simulation of quantum computation, optimisation of quantum circuits, termination analysis of quantum programs, and verification of quantum programs.\n\nQ Language is the second implemented imperative quantum programming language. Q Language was implemented as an extension of C++ programming language. It provides classes for basic quantum operations like QHadamard, QFourier, QNot, and QSwap, which are derived from the base class Qop. New operators can be defined using C++ class mechanism.\n\nQuantum memory is represented by class Qreg.\n\nQreg x1; // 1-qubit quantum register with initial value 0\nQreg x2(2,0); // 2-qubit quantum register with initial value 0\nThe computation process is executed using a provided simulator. Noisy environments can be simulated using parameters of the simulator.\n\nQuantum Guarded Command Language (qGCL) was defined by P. Zuliani in his PhD thesis. It is based on Guarded Command Language created by Edsger Dijkstra.\n\nIt can be described as a language of quantum programs specification.\n\nQuantum Macro Assembler (QMASM) is a low-level language specific to quantum annealers such as the D-Wave.\n\nEfforts are underway to develop functional programming languages for quantum computing. Functional programming languages are well-suited for reasoning about programs. Examples include Selinger's QPL, and the Haskell-like language QML by Altenkirch and Grattage. Higher-order quantum programming languages, based on lambda calculus, have been proposed by van Tonder, Selinger and Valiron and by Arrighi and Dowek.\n\nQFC and QPL are two closely related quantum programming languages defined by Peter Selinger. They differ only in their syntax: QFC uses a flow chart syntax, whereas QPL uses a textual syntax. These languages have classical control flow but can operate on quantum or classical data. Selinger gives a denotational semantics for these languages in a category of superoperators.\n\nQML is a Haskell-like quantum programming language by Altenkirch and Grattage. Unlike Selinger's QPL, this language takes duplication, rather than discarding, of quantum information as a primitive operation. Duplication in this context is understood to be the operation that maps formula_1 to formula_2, and is not to be confused with the impossible operation of cloning; the authors claim it is akin to how sharing is modeled in classical languages. QML also introduces both classical and quantum control operators, whereas most other languages rely on classical control.\n\nAn operational semantics for QML is given in terms of quantum circuits, while a denotational semantics is presented in terms of superoperators, and these are shown to agree. Both the operational and denotational semantics have been implemented (classically) in Haskell.\n\nLIQUi|> (pronounced \"liquid\") is a quantum simulation extension on the F# programming language. It is currently being developed by the Quantum Architectures and Computation Group (QuArC) part of the StationQ efforts at Microsoft Research. LIQUi|> seeks to allow theorists to experiment with quantum algorithm design before physical quantum computers are available for use.\n\nIt includes a programming language, optimization and scheduling algorithms, and quantum simulators. LIQUi|> can be used to translate a quantum algorithm written in the form of a high-level program into the low-level machine instructions for a quantum device.\n\nQuantum lambda calculi are extensions of the classical lambda calculus introduced by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s. The purpose of quantum lambda calculi is to extend quantum programming languages with a theory of higher-order functions.\n\nThe first attempt to define a quantum lambda calculus was made by Philip Maymin in 1996.\nHis lambda-q calculus is powerful enough to express any quantum computation. However, this language can efficiently solve NP-complete problems, and therefore appears to be strictly stronger than the standard quantum computational models (such as the quantum Turing machine or the quantum circuit model). Therefore, Maymin's lambda-q calculus is probably not implementable on a physical device .\n\nIn 2003, André van Tonder defined an extension of the lambda calculus suitable for proving correctness of quantum programs. He also provided an implementation in the Scheme programming language.\n\nIn 2004, Selinger and Valiron defined a strongly typed lambda calculus for quantum computation with a type system based on linear logic.\n\nQuipper was published in 2013. It is implemented as an embedded language, using Haskell as the host language. For this reason, quantum programs written in Quipper are written in Haskell using provided libraries. For example, the following code implements preparation of a superposition\n\nimport Quipper\n\nspos :: Bool -> Circ Qubit\nspos b = do q <- qinit b\n\n"}

The group released a self-produced EP, titled \"Lost for Words\" , in late 2000 through independent label Rocketstar Records. Sometime after this, Pizzuto and DeCastro departed from the group; the pair were replaced by Garrett Lunceford and Christian McAlhaney, respectively. Ryan Zwiefelhofer then joined on bass. The group then recorded another EP, this time with Aaron Sprinkle. This brought the band to the attention of Columbia Records president Rick Rubin and A&R representative Matt Pinfield. The band wished to release it through an independent label in order to build a fan base and tour for a period of time, before creating an album for Columbia. Columbia thought this was a good idea, and as a result, the \"Black Lines to Battlefields\" EP was released in 2003 through The Militia Group. Shortly afterwards, Lunceford left the group.\n\nThe album's sound has been described as alternative pop, pop, pop rock, and rock. All of the songs on the album were written, but were left unfinished before recording. Prior to entering the studio, the group did pre-production for a few months. By the time they entered the studio, the band had complete songs. \"Phantoms\" was recorded at The Compound in Capitol Hill, Seattle with Sprinkle handling production duties.\n\nOn February 24, 2005, \"Phantoms\" was announced for release, and the album's track listing was revealed. On March 1, 2005, \"Different\" was released as a single. In March and April, the band went on tour with Copeland, Lovedrug, As Tall as Lions and Eager Seas. On April 23, the music video for \"Different\" was released through AOL. \"Phantoms\" was released through Columbia on April 26. The band supported Anberlin and Saosin on their tour of the US in June and July. The band took Midtown's place on Warped Tour in mid-August due to them working in a studio. \"Take Cover\" was released to radio on September 13. The band supported Yellowcard on their club tour of the US in November.\n\nOn January 31, 2006, it was announced that bassist Ryan Zwiefelhofer had left the band, citing that he needed to \"find the place that defines who I am.\" The group's touring keyboardist Kyle Flynn filled in on bass duties. In February and March, the group went on the Truckstops and Statelines tour, alongside The Academy Is..., Panic! at the Disco, and Hellogoodbye. On August 2, the band announced they were breaking up. With the exception of Vena, the members formed new bands.\n\n\"Phantoms\" was met with limited critical acclaim. \"AbsolutePunk\" wrote: \"It’s not often that bands can create pop-oriented music that has lasting value, but Acceptance has managed to do it with \"Phantoms\". Outstanding vocals and truly talented songwriting sets this band apart from everybody else.\"\n\nIn 2016, Johnny Loftus from AllMusic revisited \"Phantoms\" and doubled his initial review score from two out of five stars to four out of five stars, saying that \"\"Phantoms\" is slick and melodic, drawing its tension from the careful multi-tracking of Jason Vena's vocals and layers of guitars,\" but leaving the review textually unchanged.\n\nBy March 2006, the album had sold over 75,000 copies. In the years following its release, \"Phantoms\" became a cult classic.

ARP adds another function: detection of an impending rollover. Excessive lateral force, generated by excessive speed in a turn, may result in a rollover. ARP automatically responds whenever it detects a potential rollover. ARP rapidly applies the brakes with a high burst of pressure to the appropriate wheels and sometimes decreases the engine torque to interrupt the rollover before it occurs.\n\nRollovers can also occur when the vehicle is knocked into a stationary object such as a curb. In these so-called \"trip events\", a vehicle hit from the side but kept from moving laterally by a curb would produce a moment about the center of gravity sufficient to produce a rollover. To counteract this, rollover stability systems have begun to incorporate an active suspension system in rollover protection. To accomplish this, the onboard computer uses data from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) to determine when a vehicle is in a rollover condition independent of yaw rate and vehicle speed. When the computer determines that the vehicle is at risk of rollover, it calculates the direction of roll and activates the active suspension system. The force produced in the suspension creates a moment (torque) opposite to that created by the lateral force, and keeps the vehicle safe.\n\nThe phrase is also used for active roll over bars for convertible cars, such as the Volkswagen Beetle, which can detect potential roll-over situations and automatically raises rollover bars hidden in the rear head restraints in a fraction of a second.\n\n"}

The reaction was discovered by Ihsan Ullah Khand (1935-1980), who was working as a postdoctoral associate with Peter Ludwig Pauson (1925-2013) at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. This reaction was originally mediated by stoichiometric amounts of dicobalt octacarbonyl, but newer versions are both more efficient and catalytic.\n\nWith unsymmetrical alkenes or alkynes, regioselectivity can be problematic, but less so with intramolecular reactions.\n\nThe reaction works with both terminal and internal alkynes although internal alkynes tend to give lower yields.

{"id": "2137708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2137708", "title": "Wheel speed sensor", "text": "Wheel speed sensor\n\nA wheel speed sensor or vehicle speed sensor (VSS) is a type of tachometer. It is a sender device used for reading the speed of a vehicle's wheel rotation. It usually consists of a toothed ring and pickup.\n\nThe wheel speed sensor was initially used to replace the mechanical linkage from the road wheels to the speedometer, eliminating cable breakage and simplifying the gauge construction (elimination all moving parts except for the needle/spring assembly). With the advent of automated driving aid, such as electronic ABS, the sensor also provided wheel speed data to the controllers to assist the operator in maintaining control of the vehicle. The vehicle Speed sensor is also used for the proper shifting up of gears for the vehicle maintenance.\n\nThe most common wheel speed sensor system consists of a ferromagnetic toothed reluctor ring (tone wheel) and a sensor (which can be passive or active).\n\nThe tone wheel is typically made of steel and may be an open-air design, or sealed (as in the case of unitized bearing assemblies). The number of teeth is chosen as a trade-off between low-speed sensing/accuracy and high-speed sensing/cost. Greater numbers of teeth will require more machining operations and (in the case of passive sensors) produce a higher frequency output signal which may not be as easily interpreted at the receiving end, but give a better resolution and higher signal update rate.\nIn more advanced systems, the teeth can be asymmetrically shaped to allow the sensor to distinguish between forward and reverse rotation of the wheel.\n\nA passive sensor typically consists of a ferromagnetic rod which is oriented to project radially from the tone wheel with a permanent magnet at the opposite end. The rod is wound with fine wire which experiences an induced alternating voltage as the tone wheel rotates, as the teeth interfere with the magnetic field. Passive sensors output a sinusoidal signal which grows in magnitude and frequency with wheel speed.\n\nA variation of the passive sensor does not have a magnet backing it, but rather a tone wheel which consists of alternating magnetic poles produce the alternating voltage. The output of this sensor tends to resemble a square wave, rather than a sinusoid, but still increases in magnitude as wheels speed increases.\n\nAn active sensor is a passive sensor with signal conditioning circuitry built into the device. This signal conditioning may be amplifying the signal's magnitude; changing the signal's form to PWM, square wave, or others; or encoding the value into a communication protocol (such as CAN) before transmission.\n\nThe vehicle speed sensor (VSS) may be, but is not always, a true wheel speed sensor. For example, in the Ford AOD transmission, the VSS is mounted to the tailshaft extension housing and is a self-contained tone ring and sensor. Though this does not give wheel speed (as each wheel in an axle with a differential is able to turn at differing speeds, and neither is solely dependent on the driveshaft for its final speed), under typical driving conditions this is close enough to provide the speedometer signal, and was used for the rear wheel ABS systems on 1987 and newer Ford F-Series, the first pickups with ABS.\n\nWheel speed sensors are in anti-lock braking systems\n\nMany of the subsystems in a rail vehicle, such as a locomotive or multiple unit, depend on a reliable and precise rotary speed signal, in some cases as a measure of the speed or changes in the speed. This applies in particular to traction control, but also to wheel slide protection, registration, train control, door control and so on. These tasks are performed by a number of rotary speed sensors that may be found in various parts of the vehicle.\n\nSpeed sensor failures are frequent, and are mainly due to the extremely harsh operating conditions encountered in rail vehicles. The relevant standards specify detailed test criteria, but in practical operation the conditions encountered are often even more extreme (such as shock/vibration and especially electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)).\n\nAlthough rail vehicles occasionally do use drives without sensors, most need a rotary speed sensor for their regulator system. The most common type is a two-channel sensor that scans a toothed wheel on the motor shaft or gearbox which may be dedicated to this purpose or may be already present in the drive system.\n\nModern Hall effect sensors of this type make use of the principle of magnetic field modulation and are suitable for ferromagnetic target wheels with a module between m =1 and m = 3.5 (D.P.=25 to D.P.=7). The form of the teeth is of secondary importance; target wheels with involute or rectangular toothing can be scanned. Depending on the diameter and teeth of the wheel it is possible to get between 60 and 300 pulses per revolution, which is sufficient for drives of lower and medium traction performance.\n\nThis type of sensor normally consists of two hall effect sensors, a rare earth magnet and appropriate evaluation electronics. The field of the magnet is modulated by the passing target teeth. This modulation is registered by the Hall sensors, converted by a comparator stage to a square wave signal and amplified in a driver stage.\n\nUnfortunately, the Hall effect varies greatly with temperature. The sensors’ sensitivity and also the signal offset therefore depend not only on the air gap but also on the temperature. This also very much reduces the maximum permissible air gap between the sensor and the target wheel. At room temperature an air gap of 2 to 3 mm can be tolerated without difficulty for a typical target wheel of module m = 2, but in the required temperature range of from −40 °C to 120 °C the maximum gap for effective signal registration drops to 1.3 mm.\nSmaller pitch target wheels with module m = 1 are often used to get a higher time resolution or to make the construction more compact. In this case the maximum possible air gap is only 0.5 to 0.8 mm.\n\nFor the design engineer, the visible air gap that the sensor ends up with is primarily the result of the specific machine design, but is subject to whatever constraints are needed to register the rotary speed. If this means that the possible air gap has to lie within a very small range, then this will also restrict the mechanical tolerances of the motor housing and target wheels to prevent signal dropouts during operation. This means that in practice there may be problems, particularly with smaller pitched target wheels of module m = 1 and disadvantageous combinations of tolerances and extreme temperatures. From the point of view of the motor manufacturer, and even more so the operator, it is therefore better to look for speed sensors with a wider range of air gap.\n\nThe primary signal from a Hall sensor loses amplitude sharply as the air gap increases. For Hall sensor manufacturers this means that they need to provide maximum possible compensation for the Hall signal's physically induced offset drift. The conventional way of doing this is to measure the temperature at the sensor and use this information to compensate the offset, but this fails for two reasons: firstly because the drift does not vary linearly with the temperature, and secondly because not even the sign of the drift is the same for all sensors.\n\nSome sensors now offer an integrated signal processor that attempts to correct the offset and amplitude of the Hall sensor signals. This correction enables a larger maximum permissible air gap at the speed sensor. On a module m = 1 target wheel these new sensors can tolerate an air gap of 1.4 mm, which is wider than that for conventional speed sensors on module m = 2 target wheels. On a module m = 2 target wheel the new speed sensors can tolerate gap of as much as 2.2 mm. It has also been possible to markedly increase the signal quality. Both the duty cycle and the phase displacement between the two channels is at least three times as stable in the face of fluctuating air gap and temperature drift. In addition, in spite of the complex electronics it has also been possible to increase the mean time between failures for the new speed sensors by a factor of three to four. So they not only provide more precise signals, their signal availability is also significantly better.\n\nAn alternative to Hall effect sensors with gears are sensors or encoders which use [magnetoresistance]. Because the target wheel is an active, multipole magnet, air gaps can be even larger, up to 4.0 mm. Because magnetoresistive sensors are angle-sensitive and amplitude-insensitive, signal quality is increased over Hall sensors in fluctuating gap applications. Also the signal quality is much higher, enabling [interpolation] within the sensor/encoder or by an external circuit.\n\nThere is a limit on the number of pulses achievable by Hall sensors without integrated bearings: with a 300 mm diameter target wheel it is normally not possible to get beyond 300 pulses per revolution. But many locomotives and electric multiple units (EMUs) need higher numbers of pulses for proper operation of the traction converter, for instance when there are tight constraints on the traction regulator at low speeds.\n\nSuch Hall effect sensor applications may benefit from built-in bearings, which can tolerate an air gap many orders of magnitude smaller because of the greatly reduced play on the actual sensor as opposed to that of the motor bearing. This makes it possible to choose a much smaller pitch for the measuring scale, right down to module m = 0.22. Likewise, the magnetoresistive sensors offer even higher resolution and accuracy than Hall sensors when implemented in motor encoders with integrated bearings.\n\nFor even greater signal accuracy a precision encoder can be used.\n\nThe functional principles of the two encoders are similar: a multichannel magneto-resistive sensor scans a target wheel with 256 teeth, generating sine and cosine signals. Arctangent interpolation is used to generate rectangular pulses from the sine/cosine signal periods. The precision encoder also possesses amplitude and offset correction functions. This makes it possible to further improve the signal quality, which greatly improves traction regulation.\n\nBearingless speed sensors may be found in almost every wheelset of a rail vehicle. They are principally used for wheel slide protection and usually supplied by the manufacturer of the wheel slide protection system. These sensors require a sufficiently small air gap and need to be particularly reliable.\nOne special feature of rotary speed sensors that are used for wheel slide protection is their integrated monitoring functions. Two-wire sensors with a current output of 7 mA/14 mA are used to detect broken cables. Other designs provide for an output voltage of around 7 V as soon as the signal frequency drops below 1 Hz. Another method used is to detect a 50 MHz output signal from the sensor when the power supply is periodically modulated at 50 MHz. It is also common for two-channel sensors to have electrically isolated channels.\nOccasionally it is necessary to take off the wheel slide protection signal at the traction motor, and the output frequency is then often too high for the wheel slide protection electronics. For this application a speed sensor with an integrated frequency divider or encoder can be utilized.\n\nA rail vehicle, particularly a locomotive, possesses numerous subsystems that require separate, electrically isolated speed signals. There usually are neither enough mounting places nor is there sufficient space where separate pulse generators could be installed. Multi-channel pulse generators that are flange-mounted onto the bearing shells or covers of wheelsets offer a solution. Using a number of bearingless speed sensors would also involve additional cables, which should preferably be avoided for outdoor equipment because they are so susceptible to damage, for instance from flying track ballast.\n\nFrom one to four channels can be implemented, each channel having a photosensor that scans one of at most two signal tracks on a slotted disk. Experience shows that the possible number of channels achievable by this technique is still not enough. A number of subsystems therefore have to make do with looped-through signals from the wheel slide protection electronics and are therefore forced to accept, for instance, the available number of pulses, although a separate speed signal might well have some advantages.\n\nThe use of optical sensors is widespread in industry. Unfortunately they do have two fundamental weaknesses that have always made it very difficult to get them to function reliably over a number of years, namely\n– the optical components are extremely susceptible to dirt, and\n– the light source ages too quickly.\n\nEven traces of dirt greatly reduce the amount of light that passes through the lens and can cause signal dropout. These encoders are therefore required to be very well sealed. Further problems are encountered when the pulse generators are used in environments in which the dew point is passed: the lenses fog and the signal is frequently interrupted.\n\nThe light sources used are light-emitting diodes (LEDs). But LEDs are always subject to aging, which over a few years leads to a noticeably reduced beam. Attempts are made to compensate for this by using special regulators that gradually increase the current through the LED, but unfortunately this further accelerates the aging process.\n\nThe principle used in scanning a ferromagnetic measuring scale magnetically does not exhibit these deficiencies. During many years’ experience of using magnetic encoders there have been occasions when a seal has failed and a pulse generator has been found to be completely covered in a thick layer of brake dust and other dirt, but such pulse generators still functioned perfectly.\n\nHistorically, magnetic sensor systems cost more than optical systems, but this difference is narrowing rapidly. Magnetic Hall and magnetoresistive sensor systems can be imbedded in plastic or potting material, which increases mechanical reliability and eliminates damage from water and grease.\n\nWheel speed sensors can also include hysteresis. This suppresses any extraneous pulses while the vehicle is at a standstill.\nPulse generators constructed in accordance with this principle have been successfully field tested by several rail operators since the beginning of 2005. The type test specified in EN 50155 has also been successfully completed, so that these pulse generators can now be delivered.\n\nInside-journal bogies make particular demands on the pulse generator designer because they have no bearing cover on the end to serve as the basis from which the rotation of the wheelset shaft could be registered. In this case the pulse generator has to be mounted on a shaft stub attached to the wheelset and fitted with a torque converter connected to the bogie frame to prevent it from rotating.\n\nThe extreme vibration in this location leads to a considerable load on the pulse generator bearing, which, with this method of installation has to carry not only the relatively small mass of the pulse generator shaft but that of the entire pulse generator. When we consider that bearing life reduces with at least the third power of the load we can see that a reliable and durable pulse generator for such a situation cannot merely be adapted from the more common standard pulse generator for outside-journal bogies merely by fitting and intermediate flange or similar construction. It really is necessary to have a pulse generator with a modified design adapted to the requirements of such a location.\n\nSome transport companies are faced with a special problem: the circulating air that keeps the motors cool carries swarf abraded from the wheels and rails. This collects on the heads of magnetic sensors. \nThere are also increasingly motors in which sensors have to scan aluminium target wheels, for instance because the impellers are made of an aluminium alloy and the manufacturer does not wish to have to shrink on a separate ferromagnetic gear rim.\n\nFor these applications there are speed sensors available that do not require a target magnet. A number of transmitting and receiving coils are used to generate an alternating electric field with a frequency of the order of 1 MHz and the modulation of the coupling between senders and receivers is then evaluated. This sensor is installation and signal compatible to the magnetic sensors; for most common target wheel modules the units can simply be replaced without any other measures being necessary.\n\nCustomers often want a higher number of pulses per revolution than can be achieved in the space available and with the smallest module m = 1. To achieve this goal, sensors are available which offer interpolation. These offer output of 2-64X the original number of gear teeth or magnetic poles on the target wheel. Accuracy is dependent on the quality of sensor input: Hall sensors are lower cost, but lower accuracy, magnetoresistive sensors are higher cost, but higher accuracy.\n\n"}

In the latter case, it may use either a transport layer virtual circuit protocol such as the TCP protocol, allowing data to be delivered in order although the lower layer switching is connectionless, or it may be a data link layer or network layer switching mode, where all data packets belonging to the same traffic stream are delivered over the same path, and traffic flows are identified by some \"connection identifier\" rather than by complete routing information, allowing fast hardware based switching . \n\nConnection-oriented protocol services are often, but not always, \"reliable\" network services, that provide acknowledgment after successful delivery, and automatic repeat request functions in case of missing data or detected bit-errors. ATM, Frame Relay and MPLS are examples of a connection-oriented, unreliable protocol.\n\nCircuit switched communication, for example the public switched telephone network, ISDN, SONET/SDH and optical mesh networks, are intrinsically connection-oriented communications systems. Circuit mode communication provides guarantees that data will arrive with constant bandwidth and at constant delay and in-order delivery of a bit stream or byte stream is provided. The switches are reconfigured during a circuit establishment phase.\n\nPacket switched communication may also be connection-oriented, which is called virtual circuit mode communication. Due to the packet switching, the communication may suffer from variable bit rate and delay, due to varying traffic load and packet queue lengths. Connection-oriented communication are not necessarily reliable protocols. \n\nBecause they can keep track of a conversation, connection-oriented protocols are sometimes described as stateful.\n\nConnection-oriented transport layer protocols provide connection-oriented communications over connectionless communications systems. A connection-oriented transport layer protocol, such as TCP, may be based on a connectionless network layer protocol (such as IP), but still achieves in-order delivery of a byte-stream, by means of segment sequence numbering on the sender side, packet buffering and data packet reordering on the receiver side. The sequence numbering requires two-way synchronization of segment counters during a three-step connection establishment phase .\n\nIn a connection-oriented packet switched data link layer or network layer protocol, all data is sent over the same path during a communication session. The protocol identifies traffic flows only by a channel/data stream number, often denoted virtual circuit identifier (VCI), rather than by complete routing information for each packet (source and destination addresses) used in connectionless datagram switching such as conventional IP routers. In connection-oriented communication, routing information may be provided to the network nodes during the connection establishment phase, where the VCI is defined in tables in each node. Thus, the actual packet switching and data transfer can be taken care of by fast hardware, as opposed to slow software based routing. Typically, this connection identifier is a small integer (10 bits for Frame Relay, 24 bits for ATM, for example). This makes network switches substantially faster (as routing tables are just simple look-up tables, and are trivial to implement in hardware). The impact is so great, in fact, that even characteristically connectionless protocols, such as IP traffic, are being \"tagged\" with connection-oriented header prefixes (e.g., as with MPLS, or IPv6's built-in Flow ID field ). \n\nATM and Frame Relay, for example, are both examples of a connection-oriented, unreliable data link layer protocols. There are also reliable connectionless protocols as well, such as AX.25 network layer protocol, when it passes data in I-frames. But this combination is rare, and reliable-connectionless is uncommon in modern networks. \nConnection-oriented protocols handle real-time traffic substantially more efficiently than connectionless protocols, especially with short constant length packets, which is why ATM has yet to be replaced with Ethernet for carrying real-time, isochronous traffic streams, especially in heavily aggregated networks like backbones, where the motto \"bandwidth is cheap\" fails to deliver on its promise. Experience has also shown that over-provisioning bandwidth does not resolve all quality of service issues. Hence, (10-)gigabit Ethernet is not expected to replace ATM at this time. \nSome connection-oriented protocols have been designed or altered to accommodate both connection-oriented and connectionless data.\n\nExamples of connection-oriented packet mode communication, i.e. virtual circuit mode communication: \n\n"}

Hayes' most prominent role was the presenter of Thames Television's children's show \"Rainbow\" from 1973 to 1992, replacing original host David Cook. Before this, he worked as an actor, including a recurring role in BBC1's police drama \"Z-Cars\". Hayes also has writing credits for \"Rainbow\" and \"The Great Pony Raid\" in 1967.\n\nHayes struggled to find work after \"Rainbow\" was cancelled by ITV when the production company, Thames Television, lost its franchise in the early 1990s. He took a job stacking shelves for his local Sainsbury's grocery for four months as he had not yet found an acting job and his wife wanted him to earn an income. He spent time as a taxicab driver and then retired some time later. He stated he would like to have done serious acting work after \"Rainbow\" but \"directors could only think of me as \"Rainbow\"'s Geoffrey\".

The Xunta de Galicia has delegations in the four capital cities of Galicia: A Coruña, Pontevedra, Ourense and Lugo.\n\nArticle 16, Section 2 of the Galician Statute of Autonomy states that \n\nThe Xunta de Galicia finds its origins in the Xunta of the Kingdom of Galicia active between 1528 and 1833. The Xunta was Galicia's representation to the central Spanish monarchy. The Xunta was composed by representatives from the cities (dioceses) of Santiago de Compostela, Lugo, Betanzos, A Coruña, Mondoñedo, Ourense and Tui. But at that time the Xunta did not hold real power; it was a consultative body only.\n\nDuring the Peninsular War, started in 1808, the \"Xunta Suprema de Galicia\" directed the war against the French invaders and maintained the public order in Galician territory. This \"Xunta Suprema\" was in charge of military, legislative issues, and international relations. It was the first time that the Xunta had real autonomy, as the Spanish control weakened. This situation lasted until the French invaders were eventually expelled from the Iberian Peninsula and Ferdinand VII of Spain gradually recovered control over former territories (1813–1814).\n\nIn 1833 the Xunta was dismantled following the provincial division engaged in Spain by minister Javier de Burgos, under the regency of Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies. In this way, Galicia was separated into four provinces, each one managed by a Provincial Council.\n\nYet, in 1843 the \"Xunta Central de Galicia\" was created and presided over by Xosé Maria Suances. In 1846 commander Miguel Solís initiated a military uprising in Lugo. He put an end to the Provincial Councils and created the \"Xunta Superior do Goberno de Galicia\", presided over by Pio Rodríguez Terrazo. This movement attempted to re-unify Galicia and called for Galicia's self-rule. Solís was eventually defeated at the Battle of Cacheiras (23 April 1846) and the so-called Martyrs of Carral were executed on 27 April.\n\nProspects for Galician self-government and possible restoration of a Xunta came close while the Galician Statute of Autonomy of 1936 was being discussed, at the time of the Spanish Second Republic (1931–1939). However, the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) and subsequent Francoist Spain (1939–1977) halted the process. There was a temporary Galician government in exile, presided by Castelao, although this was not called Xunta but \"Consello da Galiza\" (Council of Galicia).\n\nThe process of devolution initiated by the passing of the Spanish Constitution in 1978 allowed for the establishment of a new Xunta, on 16 March 1978. The Galician Statute of Autonomy (1981), came to ratify the Xunta and Galicia's self-government.\n\nThe \"consellerías\" are the different departments, or ministries, of the Xunta de Galicia. They are the responsibility of the \"conselleiros\" (masculine) or \"conselleiras\" (feminine). The \"conselleiros\" and \"conselleiras\" form the actual cabinet of the government, close to the President. The list of current \"consellerías\" and their respective heads is as:\n\n\n\n"}

Through adoption, he is the maternal grandfather of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. He was also part of the famous Anoa'i family and was a promoter for the National Wrestling Alliance in Hawaii.\n\nAfter spending his first twenty years in American Samoa, Maivia moved to New Zealand.\n\nHe began his wrestling career, wrestling not as The High Chief, but as Prince Peter Maivia. Athletic, naturally talented and a quick study, Maivia received his original ring training in New Zealand, under the watchful eye of local wrestler/promoter Steve Rickard.\n\nBoth in and out of the ring, Rickard taught the young Samoan a great deal about his new profession, and under his guidance, Maivia developed at an amazing rate. On August 3, 1964, after less than a year in the business, the popular rookie sensation stunned New Zealand's wrestling fanbase by toppling the rugged, experienced Rickard to win the prestigious New Zealand Heavyweight title in Auckland. The title victory was impressive, indeed, however Maivia's reign turned out to be extremely short, and he held the coveted New Zealand title for just three days, dropping the championship back to Steve Rickard in Wellington on August 6, 1964. The point had been made though, and from that period forward, Maivia enjoyed main-event status in the NWA's New Zealand territory.\n\nLater in 1964, Maivia followed up his previous success by winning another very prestigious championship, the NWA Australasian Heavyweight title. Maivia became the new Australasian champion by defeating Kangaroo Kennedy in Auckland, and he would go on to carry the belt for four consecutive years before finally losing his title to Steve Rickard in 1968.\n\nAfter developing his repertoire and ring skills in New Zealand, Maivia slowly began to branch out and take bookings in other (and often larger) promotions, with success invariably following the popular islander.\n\nDuring his stay in the then called World Wide Wrestling Federation, he was one of its most prominent stars, making numerous appearances on Championship Wrestling. He worked matches with many well known wrestlers who would go on to be WWE Hall of Famers, such as Superstar Billy Graham, Ivan Putski and Bob Backlund.\n\nMaivia, also known as the Flying Hawaiian, was of the Ali'i lineage of Malietoa. Maivia's traditional Samoan tattoos, which covered his abdomen and legs, were a symbol of his High Chief status. According to Superstar Billy Graham, they were completed in three days. Maivia's grandson Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson revealed that they were done with traditional Samoan instrumentation: a small hammer, a needle, and ink. His wife Ofelia Fuataga, who became known as Lia Maivia, was regarded as one of the first female wrestling promoters. He also adopted her daughter Ata.\n\nMaivia disapproved of his daughter's relationship with Rocky Johnson because he was a wrestler. The duo married despite Maivia's objections. His son, Peter Jr., also wrestled in Hawaii and the West Coast after the passing of Peter Sr. sometimes under the name \"Prince Peter Maivia\".\n\nMaivia was considered a \"blood brother\" by Amituanai Anoa'i, the father of the Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika), thus the Anoa'i family regard the Maivia line from him on forward as an extension of their own clan.\n\nMaivia was also in the fifth James Bond film, \"You Only Live Twice\", where he plays a driver who transports a disguised Bond to Osato headquarters. His character also fights Bond, is hit with a sofa, wields a katana, and is put down with a statue. He was the (uncredited) stunt fight co-ordinator for the film.\n\nIn 1981, Maivia was diagnosed with cancer. He died on June 12, 1982. Maivia was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, along with his son-in-law Rocky Johnson, in 2008 by his grandson Dwayne Johnson. The award was accepted on his behalf by his daughter Ata Maivia-Johnson. During his tribute video, WWE chairman Vince McMahon refers to him as a 'tough S.O.B.' and somebody 'you didn't want to mess with' outside the ring, but added he was 'a real wonderful, likable guy'.\nOn October 19, 2008, Maivia's wife, Lia Maivia, died.\n\nIn the 2016 Disney animated film, Moana, the character design of Maui was derived from photographs of Peter Maivia, according to interviews with his grandson, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, who voices Maui in the film.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The name means \"warrioress,\" and the star is usually named as the 22nd brightest star in the northern hemisphere.\n\n\"Bellatrix\" was constructed in Tampa, Florida as a C2-T class merchant marine cargo ship for the Maritime Commission under the name \"Raven\". In April 1941, the War Shipping Administration transferred control of the unfinished \"Raven\" to the U.S. Navy. She was reclassified as an AKA-3 attack cargo ship, and launched in August under the command of W.F. Dietrich.\n\n\"Bellatrix\" served in the Pacific during 1942, and participated in the Battle of Guadalcanal by delivering troops and supplies to the initial attack on 7 August. She made two subsequent shipments to the island, bringing both cargo and reinforcements. In 1943 she became part of the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, participating in the Allied invasion of Sicily. A subsequent shipment to the Gilbert Islands was terminated due to engine failure; \"Bellatrix\" returned to San Francisco for repairs.\n\nIn 1944, the repaired \"Bellatrix\" joined General Holland \"Howling Mad\" Smith's amphibious fleet moving to take the island of Saipan.

It can be found in the plasma membrane as well as in the membranes of phagosomes used by neutrophil white blood cells to engulf microorganisms. Human isoforms of the catalytic component of the complex include NOX1, NOX2, NOX3, NOX4, NOX5, DUOX1, and DUOX2.\n\nNADPH oxidase catalyzes the production of a superoxide free radical by transferring one electron to oxygen from NADPH. During this process O is transported from the extracellular space to the cell interior and the H is exported.\n\nThe NADPH oxidase complex is dormant under normal circumstances, but is activated to assemble in the membranes during respiratory burst. The activated NADPH oxidase generates superoxide which has roles in animal immune response and plant signalling.\n\nSuperoxide can be produced in phagosomes which have ingested bacteria and fungi, or it can be produced outside of the cell. Superoxide kills bacteria and fungi by mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. It is presumed that superoxide kills bacteria directly, as the virulence of many pathogens is dramatically attenuated when their superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes are deleted. However, superoxide can also spontaneously form hydrogen peroxide that undergoes further reactions to generate other reactive oxygen species (ROS) like hypochlorous acid (the reactive agent in bleach). It may also inactivate critical metabolic enzymes, initiate lipid peroxidation, damage iron-sulphur clusters, and liberate redox-active iron, which allows the generation of indiscriminate oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical.\n\nCareful regulation of NADPH oxidase activity is crucial to maintain a healthy level of ROS in the body. The enzyme is dormant in resting cells but becomes rapidly activated by several stimuli, including bacterial products and cytokines. Vascular NADPH oxidases are regulated by a variety of hormones and factors known to be important players in vascular remodeling and disease. These include thrombin, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNFa), lactosylceramide, interleukin-1, and oxidized LDL. It is also stimulated by agonists and arachidonic acid. Conversely, assembly of the complex can be inhibited by apocynin and diphenylene iodonium. Apocynin decreases influenza-induced lung inflammation in mice in vivo and so may have clinical benefits in the treatment of influenza.\n\nIn animals, NADPH oxidase is found in two types: one in white blood cells (neutrophilic) and the other in vascular cells, differing in biochemical structure and functions. Neutrophilic NADPH oxidase produces superoxide almost instantaneously, where as the vascular enzyme produces superoxide in minutes to hours. Moreover, in white blood cells superoxide have been found to transfer electrons across the membrane to extracellular oxygen, while in vascular cells the radical anion appears to be released mainly intracellularly.\n\nSuperoxides are crucial in killing foreign bacteria in the human body. Consequently, under-activity can lead to an increased susceptibility to organisms such as catalase-positive microbes, and over-activity can lead to oxidative stress and cell damage.\n\nExcessive production of ROS in vascular cells causes many forms of cardiovascular disease including hypertension, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke. Atherosclerosis is caused by the accumulation of macrophages containing cholesterol (foam cells) in artery walls (in the intima). ROS produced by NADPH oxidase activate an enzyme that makes the macrophages adhere to the artery wall (by polymerizing actin fibers). This process is counterbalanced by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, and by antioxidants. An imbalance in favor of ROS produces atherosclerosis. In vitro studies have found that the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin and diphenyleneiodonium, along with the antioxidants N-acetyl-cysteine and resveratrol, depolymerized the actin, broke the adhesions, and allowed foam cells to migrate out of the intima.\n\nOne study suggests a role for NADPH oxidase in ketamine-induced loss of neuronal parvalbumin and GAD67 expression. Similar loss is observed in schizophrenia, and the results may point at the NADPH oxidase as a possible player in the pathophysiology of the disease. Nitro blue tetrazolium is used in a diagnostic test, in particular, for chronic granulomatous disease, a disease in which there is a defect in NADPH oxidase; therefore, the phagocyte is unable to make the reactive oxygen species or radicals required for bacterial killing, resulting in bacteria thriving within the phagocyte. The higher the blue score the better the cell is at producing reactive oxygen species.\n\nIt has also been shown that NADPH oxidase plays a role in the mechanism that induces the formation of sFlt-1, a protein that deactivates certain proangiogenic factors that play a role in the development of the placenta, by facilitating the formation of reactive oxygen species, which are suspected intermediaries in sFlt-1 formation. These effects are in part responsible for inducing pre-eclampsia in pregnant women\n\nMutations in the NADPH oxidase subunit genes cause several Chronic Granulomatous Diseases (CGD), characterized by extreme susceptibility to infection. These include:\n\n\nIn these diseases, cells have a low capacity for phagocytosis, and persistent bacterial infections occur. Areas of infected cells are common, granulomas. A similar disorder called neutrophil immunodeficiency syndrome is linked to a mutation in the RAC2, also a part of the complex.\n\nNADPH oxidase can be inhibited by apocynin, nitric oxide (NO), and diphenylene iodonium. Apocynin acts by preventing the assembly of the NADPH oxidase subunits. Apocynin decreases influenza-induced lung inflammation in mice \"in vivo\" and so may have clinical benefits in the treatment of influenza.\n\nInhibition of NADPH oxidase by NO blocks the source of oxidative stress in the vasculature. NO donor drugs (nitrovasodilators) have therefore been used for more than a century to treat coronary artery disease, hypertension, and heart failure by preventing excess superoxide from deteriorating healthy vascular cells.\n\nMore advanced NADPH oxidase inhibitors include GKT-831 (Formerly GKT137831), a dual Inhibitor of isoforms NOX4 and NOX1 which was patented in 2007. The compound was initially developed for Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obtained orphan drug designation by the FDA and EMA at end of 2010.\n\nThe membrane-bound vascular enzyme is composed of five parts: two cytosolic subunits (p47phox and p67phox), a cytochrome b558 which consists of gp91phox, p22phox and a small G protein Rac. Generation of the superoxide in vascular NADPH occurs by a one-electron reduction of oxygen via the gp91phox subunit, using reduced NADPH as the electron donor. The small G protein carries an essential role in the activation of the oxidase by switching between a GDP-bound (inactive) and GTP-linked (active) forms.\n\nThe isoform found in neutrophils is made up of six subunits. These subunits are:\n\nThere are several vascular isoforms of the complex which use paralogs the NOX2 subunit:\n\n\nThere are two further paralogs of NOX2 subunit in the thyroid:\n\n\n"}

This compressor pumps the air into a flexible bellows, usually made from textile-reinforced rubber. Unlike hydropneumatic suspension, which offers many similar features, air suspension does not use pressurized liquid, but pressurized air. The air pressure inflates the bellows, and raises the chassis from the axle.\n\nAir suspension is used in place of conventional steel springs in heavy vehicle applications such as buses and trucks, and in some passenger cars. It is widely used on semi trailers and trains (primarily passenger trains).\n\nThe purpose of air suspension is to provide a smooth, constant ride quality, but in some cases is used for sports suspension. Modern electronically controlled systems in automobiles and light trucks almost always feature self-leveling along with raising and lowering functions. Although traditionally called air bags or air bellows, the correct term is air spring (although these terms are also used to describe just the rubber bellows element with its end plates).\n\nIn 1901 an American, William W. Humphreys, patented an idea - a 'Pneumatic Spring for Vehicles'. The design consisted of a left and right air spring longitudinally channeled nearly the length of the vehicle. The channels were concaved to receive two long pneumatic cushions. Each one was closed at one end and provided with an air valve at the other end.\n\nFrom 1920, Frenchman George Messier provided aftermarket pneumatic suspension systems. His own 1922-1930 Messier automobiles featured a suspension \"to hold the car aloft on four gas bubbles.\"\n\nDuring World War II, the U.S. developed the air suspension for heavy aircraft in order to save weight with compact construction. Air systems were also used in heavy trucks and aircraft to attain self-levelling suspension. With adjustable air pressure, the axle height was independent of vehicle load.\n\nIn 1946, American William Bushnell Stout built a non-production prototype Stout Scarab that featured numerous innovations, including a four-wheel independent air suspension system.\n\nIn 1950, Air Lift Company patented a rubber air spring that is inserted into a car's factory coil spring. The air spring expanded into the spaces in the coil spring, keeping the factory spring from fully compressing, and the vehicle from sagging.\n\nIn 1954, Frenchman Paul Magès developed a functioning air/oil hydropneumatic suspension, incorporating the advantages of earlier air suspension concepts, but with hydraulic fluid rather than air under pressure. Citroën replaced the conventional steel springs on the rear axle of their top-of-range model, the Traction Avant 15 Hydraulique. In 1955, the Citroën DS incorporated four wheel hydropneumatic suspension. This combined a very soft, comfortable suspension, with controlled movements, for sharp handling, together with a self-levelling suspension.\n\nIn 1956 air suspension was used on EMD's experimental Aerotrain.\n\nIn the U.S., General Motors built on its World War II experience with air suspension for trucks and airplanes. It introduced air suspension as standard equipment on the new 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham. An \"Air Dome\" assembly at each wheel included sensors to compensate for uneven road surfaces and to automatically maintain the car's height. For 1958 and 1959, the system continued on the Eldorado Brougham, and was offered as an extra cost option on other Cadillacs.\n\nIn 1958, Buick introduced an optional \"Air-Poised Suspension\" with four cylinders of air (instead of conventional coil springs) for automatic leveling, as well as a \"Bootstrap\" control on the dashboard to raise the car for use on steep ramps or rutted country roads, as well as for facilitating tire changes or to clean the whitewall tires. For 1959, Buick offered an optional \"Air Ride\" system on all models that combined \"soft-rate\" steel coil springs in the front with air springs in the rear.\n\nAn optional air suspension system was available on the 1958 and 1959 Rambler Ambassadors, as well as on all American Motors \"Cross Country\" station wagon models. The \"Air-Coil Ride\" utilized an engine-driven compressor, reservoir, air bags within the coil springs, and a ride-height control, but the $99 optional system was not popular among buyers and American Motors (AMC) discontinued it for 1960.\n\nOnly Cadillac continued to offer air suspension through the 1960 model year, where it was standard equipment on the Eldorado Seville, Biarritz, and Brougham.\n\nIn 1960, the Borgward P 100 was the first German car with self-levelling air suspension.\n\nIn 1962, the Mercedes-Benz W112 platform featured an air suspension on the 300SE models. The system used a Bosch main valve with two axle valves on the front and one on the rear. These controlled a cone-shaped air spring on each wheel axle. The system maintained a constant ride height utilizing an air reservoir that was filled by a single-cylinder air compressor powered by the engine. In 1964, the Mercedes-Benz 600 used larger air springs and the compressed air system also powered the brake servo.\n\nRolls-Royce incorporated self-levelling suspension on the 1965 Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow, a system built under license from Citroën.\n\nIn 1975, the Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 incorporated a hydropneumatic suspension when the patents on the technology had expired. This design replaced the expensive, complex, and problematic compressed air system that was still used on the 600 models until 1984.\n\nAir suspension was not included in standard production American-built cars between 1960 and 1983. In 1984, Ford Motor Company incorporated a new design as a feature on the Lincoln Continental Mark VII.\n\nIn 1986, Toyota Soarer introduced the first electronically controlled (TEMS), a semi-active full air suspension (spring constant, variable attenuation force).\n\nDunlop Systems Coventry UK were also pioneers of Electronically Controlled Air Suspension (ECAS) for off-road vehicles - the term ECAS was successfully trade marked. The system was first fitted to the 93MY Land Rover Range Rover.\n\nIn 1989, Arnott Air Suspension Products is founded, eventually expanding to a 300,000 square foot manufacturing plant in Merritt Island, Fl., including 65,000 sq. ft Research & Development center dedicated to Air Suspension, assisting in patents for BMW, Mercedes-Benz and more.\n\nIn 2002 the GMT 360 Trail Blazer SUV featured rear air assist air suspension with Dunlop air springs and an integrated Wabco control system.\n\nIn 2005 the GM H2 HUMMER featured an optional rear air suspension system with a dual compressor control system from Dunlop to support tire inflation for off-road applications.\n\nIn 2013, the Tesla Model S began offering height adjustable air suspension.\n\nVehicles that have used air suspension include models from Maybach, Rolls-Royce, Lexus, Jeep, Ram, Cadillac (GM), Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Land Rover, SsangYong, Audi, Subaru, Volkswagen, Lincoln, Ford, and Tesla, among others. Some Citroën vehicles feature Hydractive suspension, a computer controlled version of their Hydropneumatic system, which features sport and comfort modes, lowers the height of the car at high speeds and continues to maintain ride height when the engine is not running.\n\nThe air suspension designs from Lincoln, Land Rover, SsangYong, Chrysler, Subaru, Audi, Volkswagen, Tesla, Porsche, and Lexus models feature height adjustable suspension suitable for making it easier to enter the vehicle, clear bumps, or clear rough terrain. The Lincoln Continental, Town Car, Navigator and Mark VIII also featured an air suspension system which offered a controlled but smooth ride. Porsche has taken this to the next level on the Panamera with a system that changes the spring rate and damping settings, among other changes, for their sport/track modes. The Mark VIII suspension settings were also linked to the memory seat system, meaning that the car would automatically adjust the suspension to individual drivers. The control system in the Mark VIII can lower the suspension by about 25 mm (1 inch) at speeds exceeding about 100 km/h (60 mph) for improved aerodynamic performance. One way automakers strive to improve gas mileage is by utilizing active suspension technology. Tesla Motors offers an included \"Active Air Suspension\" on the Model S and Model X to lower or raise the vehicle for aerodynamics and increased range.\n\nOver the last decade or so air suspension has become popular in the custom automobile culture: street rods, trucks, cars, and even motorcycles may have air springs. They are used in these applications to provide an adjustable suspension which allows vehicles to sit extremely low, yet be able rise to a level high enough to maneuver over obstacles and inconsistencies on paved surfaces. These systems generally employ small, electric or engine-driven air compressors which sometimes fill an on-board air receiver tank which stores compressed air for use in the future without delay. It is important that the tank is sized for the task and can be calculated using a specific formula involving the compressor output, standard atmospheric pressure and compressed pressure.\n\nHigh-pressured industrial gas bottles (such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide tanks used to store shielding gases for welding) are sometimes used in more radical air suspension setups. Either of these reservoir systems may be fully adjustable, being able to adjust each wheel's air pressure individually. This allows the user to tilt the vehicle side-to-side, front-to-back, in some instances \"hit a 3-wheel\" (contort the vehicle so one wheel lifts up from the ground) or even \"hop\" the entire vehicle into the air. When a pressure reservoir is present, the flow of air or gas is commonly controlled with pneumatic solenoid valves. This allows the user to make adjustments by simply pressing a momentary-contact electric button or switch.\n\nThe installation and configuration of these systems varies for different makes and models but the underlying principle remains the same. The metal spring (coil or leaf) is removed, and an air bag, also referred to as an air spring, is inserted or fabricated to fit in the place of the factory spring. When air pressure is supplied to the air bag, the suspension can be adjusted either up or down (lifted or lowered).\n\nFor vehicles with leaf spring suspension such as pickup trucks, the leaf spring is sometimes eliminated and replaced with a multiple-bar linkage. These bars are typically in a trailing arm configuration and the air spring may be situated vertically between a link bar or the axle housing and a point on the vehicle's frame. In other cases, the air bag is situated on the opposite side of the axle from the main link bars on an additional cantilever member. If the main linkage bars are oriented parallel to the longitudinal (driving) axis of the car, the axle housing may be constrained laterally with either a Panhard rod or Watt's linkage. In some cases, two of the link bars may be combined into a triangular shape which effectively constrains the vehicles axle laterally.\n\nOften, owners may desire to lower their vehicle to such an extent that they must cut away portions of the frame for more clearance. A reinforcement member commonly referred to as a C-notch is then bolted or welded to the vehicle frame in order to maintain structural integrity. Specifically on pickup trucks, this process is termed \"notching\" because a portion (notch) of the cargo bed may also be removed, along with the wheel wells, to provide maximum axle clearance. For some, it is desirable to have the vehicle so low that the frame rests on the ground when the air bags are fully deflated. Owners generally choose between having their cars 'tuck' their wheels into the arches when their air suspension is fully lowered or alternatively they can choose to go for 'fitment' which in partnership with stretched tyres sees the arch itself fit in between the tyre and rim.\n\nAir suspension is also a common suspension upgrade for those who tow or haul heavy loads with their pick-up truck, SUV, van or car. Air springs, also called \"air helper springs,\" are placed on existing suspension components on the rear or front of the vehicle in order to increase the load capacity. One of the advantages of using air suspension as a load support enhancement is the air springs can be deflated when not towing or hauling and therefore maintaining the factory ride quality.\n\nElectronic Controlled Air Suspension (ECAS) is the name of the air suspension system installed on the Range Rover Classic in 1993 and later on the Range Rover P38A. It was developed in the early 1990s by the company now known as Dunlop Systems and Components Ltd in Coventry, UK.\n\nECAS provides variable-height suspension for on- and off-road applications. The five suspension heights typically offered by ECAS are (from lowest to highest in terms of height) \"Loading,\" \"Highway,\" \"Standard,\" \"Off-Road,\" and \"Off-Road Extended.\" Height is controlled automatically based on speed and undercarriage sensors, but a manual ride height switch allows control over the suspension by the driver. The \"Loading\" and \"Off-Road\" heights are available only at speeds typically less than . The \"Highway\" setting is not available manually; it is set when the vehicle moves at over typically for over 30 seconds. Unlike a mechanical spring system (where deflection is proportional to load), height may be varied independently from the load by altering the pressure in the air springs.\n\nThe air springs were designed to provide a smooth ride, with the additional ability to raise the body of the vehicle for off-road clearance and lower it for higher-speeds road driving. Mechanical springs, for which deflection is proportional to load, cannot do this; with ECAS height is largely independent of load. The developers of ECAS also designed LoadSafe, a related system to ascertain load and change in load on an LCV type vehicle fitted with air springs.\n\nThe system comprises:\n\nAir bag or air strut failure is usually caused by wet rust, due to old age, or moisture within the air system that damages it from the inside. Air ride suspension parts may fail because rubber dries out. Punctures to the air bag may be caused from debris on the road. With custom applications, improper installation may cause the air bags to rub against the vehicle's frame or other surrounding parts, damaging it. The over-extension of an air spring which is not sufficiently constrained by other suspension components, such as a shock absorber, may also lead to the premature failure of an air spring through the tearing of the flexible layers. Failure of an air spring may also result in complete immobilization of the vehicle, since the vehicle will rub against the ground or be too high to move. However, most modern automotive systems have overcome many of these problems.\n\nAir line failure is a failure of the tubing which connects the air bags or struts to the rest of the air system, and is typically DOT-approved nylon air brake line. This usually occurs when the air lines, which must be routed to the air bags through the chassis of the vehicle, rub against a sharp edge of a chassis member or a moving suspension component, causing a hole to form. This mode of failure will typically take some time to occur after the initial installation of the system, as the integrity of a section of air line is compromised to the point of failure due to the rubbing and resultant abrasion of the material. An air line failure may also occur if a piece of road debris hits an air line and punctures or tears it, although this is unlikely to occur in normal road use. It does occur in harsh off-road conditions but it still not common if correctly installed.\n\nAir fitting failure usually occurs when they are first fitted or very rarely in use. Cheap low quality components tend to be very unreliable. Air fittings are used to connect components such as bags, valves, and solenoids to the air line that transfers the air. They are screwed into the component and for the most part push-in or push-to-fit DOT line is then inserted into the fitting.\n\nCompressor failure is primarily due to leaking air springs or air struts. The compressor will burn out trying to maintain the correct air pressure in a leaking air system. Compressor burnout may also be caused by moisture from within the air system coming into contact with its electronic parts. This is far more likely to occur with low specification compressors with insufficient duty cycle which are often purchased due to low cost. For redundancy in the system two compressors are often a better option.\n\nIn Dryer failure the dryer, which functions to remove moisture from the air system, eventually becomes saturated and unable to perform that function. This causes moisture to build up in the system and can result in damaged air springs and/or a burned out compressor.\n\nThe ECAS computer can, using pre-programmed criteria to detect a fault, disable the system into \"Hard Fault Mode\" which lowers the vehicle to the suspension bump-stops, leaving it usable with radically reduced performance until repaired.\n\nMany enthusiasts use diagnostic devices such as laptop and hand computers running specially developed software to clear spurious faults and avoid the need for repair. Some manipulate the sensors to set the vehicle to a particular ride height at all times by adjusting the lever ratio on the height-sensing devices, or a supplementary ECU to \"fool\" the system.\n\nLeaks in the system, often due to main seal wear caused by excessive duty cycle, can cause premature compressor failure.\n\nThe current market of buses have suspension system consisting of either mechanical or air suspension system. Compared to its counterpart, air suspension system has significant benefits. Vehicle height can be maintained at a particular value irrespective of its load by varying the pressure. Standard coaches also have a system called ferry lift. This allows the air suspension to be raised above the normal ride height level to aid loading and unloading the coach on and off ferries due to their steep ramps and risk of grounding out, but can also be used on rough ground or on steep crests. Although the ferry lift may be installed on some buses, the Kneel Down facility is more common on public transport buses. This helps reduce the step height for easy ingress of passengers. The Kneel Down facility is also used when using the built-in wheelchair ramps. Due to several advantages, air suspension has been extensively used in commercial vehicles since 1980.\n\n"}

Pouilly-Fuissé has Chardonnay as the only grape variety.\n\nWhile Pouilly-Fuissé is the best-known part of Mâconnais, there are no Premier Cru vineyards within the AOC, as the local growers at the time the regulations were being drawn up never applied for this. The AOC was created on 11 September 1936. The area used to be known simply as \"Pouilly\", but when the AOC laws were introduced, it was split into three: Pouilly-Fuissé, Pouilly-Loché and Pouilly-Vinzelles.\n\nDespite the lack of official classification within the AOC, some \"climats\" within Pouilly-Fuissé have better reputations than others.\n\nPouilly-Fuissé is a dry white wine made from Chardonnay grapes. It is pale and refreshing, often quite delicate, and often shows a clear oak influence. On average these wines sell for much less than the white wines of Côte de Beaune to the north.\n\nWest of Mâcon the land rises up to form Mont de Pouilly and other limestone hills, covered in the alkaline clay that best suits Chardonnay. The villages of Vergisson, Solutré-Pouilly, Fuissé and Chaintré shelter at their feet.\n\nIn 2008, of vineyard surface was in production within the Pouilly-Fuissé AOC, and 39,147 hectoliters of wine were produced, corresponding to 5.2 million bottles of wine.\n\nThe AOC regulations only allow Chardonnay to be used. The allowed base yield is 50 hectoliter per hectare and the grapes must reach a maturity of at least 11.0 per cent potential alcohol.\n\nThe négociant Georges Duboeuf of the Beaujolais wine region grew up on a small vineyard in the region.\n\nIn \"Hogan's Heroes\", Season 2, Episode 10, \"A Tiger Hunt in Paris, Part 1,\" LeBeau recommends Pouilly-Fuisse '41 for lunch, describing it as \"not a daring wine, but a safe wine.\"\n\n\"The Facts of Life\", Season 3, Episode 1, \"Growing Pains\", Blair brings back two bottles of Pouilly-Fuisse.\n\n\"The Andy Griffith Show\" includes the wine \nin the Season 6, Episode 2, called \"Andy's Rival\".\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0512418/\n\nIn the Season 5, Episode 6 of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" entitled \"I Love a Piano\", Murray returns to work intoxicated after having had a long lunch with a divorcee. When Lou asks him what he has been imbibing, he replies, \"Pouilly-Fuissé.\" Lou says, \"Too bad [...] I've been a news man for thirty years. I've sobered up guys who were drunk on everything from Scotch to aftershave lotion. But never once in my life have I had to sober up anyone who was drunk on Pouilly-Fuissé. I don't know what to do. I don't know whether to give him black coffee or cheese!\"\n\nIn the Season 6, Episode 10 of \"The Jeffersons\" entitled “Louise vs. Florence,” Pouilly-Fuissé is prominently referenced by several characters, including Harry Bentley (Paul Benedict), George Jefferson (Sherman Hemsley), and Mr. Van Morris (a guest-starring role played by Fred D. Scott).\n\nIn the \"Frasier\" episode \"Three Dates and a Breakup: Part 2,\" Frasier Crane refers to a 1992 Pouilly-Fuissé as \"the nectar of the Gods.\"\n\nJimmy Buffet's song \"Landfall\" contains a reference: \"Oh, I love the smell of fresh snapper fried light; What'd you say, Pouilly-Fuisse could round out the night.\"\n\nThe song \"Intravino\", by Daryl Hall & John Oates from their 1979 album \"X-Static\", has the lyrics: \"Six o'clock, gotta have Beaujolais. Eight o'clock, I open up the Pouilly-Fuissé.\"\n\nErnest Hemingway references Pouilly-Fuisse several times in \"A Moveable Feast\". In a meeting with the poet Ernest Walsh, \"at a restaurant that was the best and most expensive in the Boulevard St.-Michel quarter,\" the two dine on oysters \"and a bottle of Pouilly Fuisse...\" while discussing their mutual friends James Joyce and Ezra Pound.\n\nThe wines of Pouilly-Fuissé should not be confused with the Sauvignon blanc-based wines of Pouilly-Fumé and the Chasselas-based Pouilly-sur-Loire, both from the area around Pouilly-sur-Loire in the Loire Valley.\n"}

The list was called the Prontuario in short and later formed an important part of the Italianization campaign initiated by the fascist regime, as it became the basis for the official place and district names in the Italian-annexed southern part of the County of Tyrol.\n\nIt has often been criticized by the German-speaking population of the province, on the grounds that the new names often have little perceived historical relevance and that a number have been entirely invented.\n\nIn the 1890s Ettore Tolomei founded a nationalist magazine \"The Italian Nation\", and in 1906 the \"Archivio per l'Alto Adige\". His intention was to create the impression that South Tyrol had originally been an Italian territory, that the German history of South Tyrol was merely a short interruption and that as a consequence the land rightfully belonged to Italy.\n\nToponomy played a major part in Tolomei's struggle right from the beginning. In the articles he wrote for \"The Italian Nation\" he already used Italianized names, although these early attempts lacked the method and purpose of his later activities. In those days he would use the name \"Alto Trentino\" for South Tyrol, not having yet come upon and revived the Napoleonic creation \"Alto Adige\", which would become the official Italian designation for the province after World War I and up to this day. Likewise, he used to call the Brenner Pass \"Pirene\", which in his later publications would become \"Brennero\". His work became more systematical with the founding of the \"Archivio per l' Alto Adige\", through which he began to propose Italianized names for villages and geographical features in South Tyrol. In 1916, a year after Italy, instigated by Allied promises and its own nationalist tendencies, entered the First World War, a commission was set up to find Italian names for places in the \"soon to be conquered territory\". The commission (composed of Tolomei himself, the Professor of Botany and Chemistry Ettore De Toni as well as the librarian Vittorio Baroncelli) reported almost 12,000 Italian place and district names on the basis of Tolomei's studies. In June 1916, this list was published as \"Volume XV, Part II\" of \"Memorie\" of the \"Reale Società Geografica Italiana\" as well as in the \"Archivio per l'Alto Adige\".\n\nTolomei explained the methodology for creating Italian names in his introduction to the \"Prontuario\". The main principles are:\n\n\nThis methodology was however not applied in a uniform, consistent manner, so that often the choice of name seems to have been arbitrary — thus increasing the perception of imposition. While the aim of Tolomeis toponymy was that of bringing the Latin history back to the surface, more often than not it has been perceived as to bury the Romanic roots of historically grown names even deeper due to the relative linguistic incompetence of Tolomei and his team. This can be exemplified by the name of the village \"Lana\", which probably goes back to a Roman landholder named \"Leo\", whose territory was called \"(praedium) Leonianum\". In the High Middle Ages the name was pronounced \"Lounan\". In the Bavarian dialect, the vocal \"ou\" changed to \"a\" in the 12th century, leading to \"Lanan\", which became today's \"Lana\" in German. Contrary to his stated methodology Tolomei kept the name Lana, probably because it sounded Italian and in Italian \"lana\" means \"wool\". The correct Italianization would have been \"Leoniano\" (although exact reconstruction may have been abandoned in favor of pragmatism and aesthetics). The same applies to German Trens and Terenten, derived from Latin \"torrens\" (stream), which were Italianized as Trens and Terento, not recognizing the Romanic roots still present in the German name.\n\nApart from the frequent mistakes and inconsistencies of Tolomei's toponymy, its main fault is the loss of historical information contained in the historically grown geographical names, an effect which was fully intended by Tolomei. Instead of bringing back Alpine Romanity which spoke a Rhaeto-Romance language, he superimposed the Tuscan dialect, on which Standard Italian is based, on the local Romanic traditions. A case in point is the name \"Vipiteno\", derived from Latin \"Vipitenum\". Tolomei preferred this Latin name to \"Sterzen\", the name commonly used by Italians at that time. In doing so, however, he unwittingly chose a name which had undergone Germanization. The original Alpine-Romanic name would have been \"Vibidina\"; the German sound change in the 8th century changed this into \"Wipitina\". As such it was first mentioned in the medieval Latin manuscripts, and in the more recent ones it was further Latinized into \"Vipitenum\", a name which sounded as if it could have been of ancient Roman origin and thus was chosen by Tolomei.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2137782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2137782", "title": "Interstate 80 Business (Sacramento, California)", "text": "Interstate 80 Business (Sacramento, California)\n\nInterstate 80 Business, called the Capital City Freeway in its entirety and also known as Business 80, is a business loop of Interstate 80 (I-80) through Sacramento. The route is also colloquially referred to as \"Cap City Freeway\" and \"Biz 80\". The entire route is a freeway.\n\nIt originally carried mainline I-80 through Sacramento until the early 1980s. The eastern half, originally known as the Elvas Freeway, was initially grandfathered into the Interstate Highway System; however, plans to upgrade or realign this portion to meet Interstate Highway standards were cancelled. As such, the I-80 designation through Sacramento was moved to a northern bypass of the city that had previously been signed I-880, and the former routing was then designated as Business 80.\n\nBusiness 80 then consisted of two connected segments. The western segment ran concurrently signed with U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and also carried the unsigned designation of I-305. The eastern segment was assigned the unsigned designation of State Route 51 (SR 51). After travelers complained that Business 80 was difficult to follow, it was named the \"Capital City Freeway\" in 1996. As part of a re-signing project which commenced in 2016, references to Business 80 on the western segment are to be removed, subsequently marking the route as only US 50, but as of 2018 little progress has been done.\n\nSR 51 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and both SR 51 and I-305 are part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. Currently, it is the only business route in California to exist as a freeway.\n\nThe western section of Business 80 begins in West Sacramento at I-80, where I-80 leaves the West Sacramento Freeway onto the Beltline Freeway (which travels north of the Bryte neighborhood, over the Sacramento River, and into the Natomas area). This interchange in West Sacramento is also the current west end of US 50 and the west end of the unsigned I-305.\n\nIn downtown West Sacramento, Business 80 and US 50 split from the West Sacramento Freeway, which is now locally maintained in part over the Tower Bridge up to the door of the capitol, but was once designated as SR 275. Business 80 crosses the Sacramento River on the Pioneer Memorial Bridge, intersecting with I-5 on the eastern bank. SR 99 once ran along I-5 to the north and Business 80 to the east, but this is now signed SR 99. After crossing I-5, Business 80 runs on top of an embankment between \"W\" and \"X\" streets. The W-X Freeway gets its name from running parallel to \"W\" and \"X\" streets.\n\nBeginning in 2016, signs on the western section were being updated to remove references to Business 80 and instead sign the route only as US 50. The eastern section remains signed as Business 80. However, most Rand McNally road atlases to this day continue to sign both the eastern and western sections as Business 80.\n\nAt an interchange southeast of downtown Sacramento, Business 80 turns north onto the southern end of unsigned SR 51. US 50 continues east, SR 99 heads south, and the unsigned I-305 ends. The elevated freeway carrying Business 80 east of downtown is between 29th and 30th Streets, and an older section beginning at A Street and continuing northeast was originally known as the Elvas Freeway (and originally signed as US 99 east). On this section of freeway, Business 80 crosses the American River before its northeast-bound merge with the North Sacramento Freeway (the northern portion of SR 160 towards downtown).\n\nThe North Sacramento Freeway, originally a portion of US 40, originally ran west from Marconi Avenue to an intersection with Del Paso Boulevard. The section from Arden Way eastbound back to Marconi Avenue is now part of the currently named Capital City Freeway (while the SR 160 section retains the original freeway name). The original North Sacramento Freeway connected to the Roseville Freeway at the curve north of Marconi Avenue (commonly known as the Marconi Curve, where the freeway once ended at Auburn Boulevard). At the east end of Business 80, the Roseville Freeway continues northeast to Roseville as I-80, while the short unsigned SR 244 heads east to Auburn Boulevard.\n\nI-80 heads in both directions around the north side of Sacramento. A partially built portion of a never completed replacement freeway for SR 51, in the median of I-80, now serves as parking and access for the northernmost three stations (Watt/I-80, Watt/I-80 West, and Roseville Road) on the Sacramento Regional Transit District's light rail Blue Line. If this replacement freeway had been completely built as originally planned, I-80 would have continued south following the railroad tracks going through the Ben Ali neighborhood of North Sacramento, crossed over SR 160, and joined with the Elvas Freeway portion just north of A Street.\n\nThe State Division of Highways (predecessor to Caltrans) constructed Sacramento’s freeways system incrementally from the 1940s to the 1970s. The plan for the Elvas Freeway was presented in the Sacramento Area Traffic Survey in 1947-1948, and the freeway was built between 1950 and 1955. The Division of Highways built the 2.9 mile Elvas Freeway as a four-lane divided highway (with provisions for a six-lane freeway) to connect with the North Sacramento Freeway in the vicinity of Arden Way. The new freeway’s southern terminus was the surface roads at 29th and 30th streets. At the time the Elvas Freeway was conceived and built, the Division of Highways was already considering an elevated freeway along the 29th Street / 30th Street corridor that would connect with the then proposed South Sacramento Freeway (SR 99). The Division of Highways went on to complete the Fort Sutter Viaduct along the 29th Street / 30th Street corridor in 1968, which led the Division of Highways to convert the Elvas Freeway from four to six lanes in 1965. The Sacramento River Viaduct was completed in 1966, the Southside Park Viaduct was completed in 1967, and the rest of the W-X Freeway was completed in 1968. The Elvas Freeway was connected to the W-X Freeway to the west and US 50 to the east, in 1968 and 1971 respectively. The W-X Freeway and the Elvas Freeway were signed as I-80.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1975 a 5.2 mile bypass was proposed that was to straighten the alignment of I-80 and increase its capacity. The Sacramento City Council voted in September 1979 to delete the I-80 Bypass freeway from the Interstate System. In 1980 California submitted to AASHTO proposals to relocate I-80 in Sacramento onto then I-880, extend US 50 west to cover the west half of old I-80, and to assign I-305 to the west half of old I-80, and delete I-880 in the Sacramento area (the route would eventually be relocated to then SR 17 from I-280 in San Jose to I-80 in Oakland in 1982-1984). AASHTO approved these proposals. The next year, the California State Legislature extended US 50 west to cover the western half of old I-80, and the eastern half was assigned the new SR 51 number and designated as Business Loop 80.. The signage change from I-880 to I-80, and the previous I-80 to Business 80 was installed in November 1983.\n\nThe old I-80 was not signed as SR 51, but as a business route. Unlike most business routes in California, which run along locally-maintained streets through a downtown area, Business 80 was not assigned to the pre-freeway alignment of US 40, but to a freeway. The existence of two freeways, both numbered 80, caused some confusion, and in 1996 the full route was given the Capital City Freeway name at the request of the Sacramento Area Council of Governments. This name appears on overhead signs at prominent interchanges. The route is referred to as Business 80, the 80, Biz 80, Capital City Freeway, Cap City Freeway, and US 50 (western section only) by residents and mapmakers. Caltrans does not normally use the Business 80 designation, except for signage and other related concepts like Cal-NExUS exit numbers (which are continuous along the business loop). Caltrans refers to the western half as US 50 and the eastern half as SR 51 for traffic condition reporting.\n\nUnder the , \"Route 51 shall be signed Interstate Business Loop 80\". There is no such mandate under for Route 50, thus Caltrans was able to start removing references to Business 80 on signage in the US 50 segment.\n\nDespite Caltrans' official signage and reporting practices, mapmakers may still show the I-305 and SR 51 designations, as well as the Business 80/US 50 concurrency on the western segment. The SR 99 concurrency, running along US 50 and I-5 to northern Sacramento, is also not officially designated by Caltrans, but mapmakers will still also often show it as such.\n\nAn earlier State Route 51 was defined on July 1, 1964 on a section of pre-1964 Legislative Route 2, providing a loop east of Interstate 5 (pre-1964 Legislative Route 174 there) through Orange, around the Orange Crush Interchange. It was removed from the state highway system in 1965.\n\n"}

Mymensingh town is the district headquarters.\n\nMaimansingh, a district of British India, was in the Maimansingh division of Eastern Bengal and Assam. It occupies a portion of the alluvial valley of the Brahmaputra east of the main channel (called the Jamuna) and north of Dacca. The administrative headquarters are at Nasirabad, usually called Mymensingh town. Area, 6332 sq mi Pop. (1901) 3,915,068, showing an increase of 12.8% in the decade. The district is for the most part level and open, covered with well-cultivated fields, and intersected by numerous rivers.\n\nThe district was acquired by the East India Company with the \"Dewani Grant\" from the Mughal Emperor in 1765. At that time its greater part was included in the Niabat (Sub-Province of Dhaka) and a small portion in the Zamindaries of Atia, Kagmari, Pukuria and Patilandaha (of Rahahahi Zamindari). At the time of Permanent Settlement, it included northwest Garo-Hills and the Brahmandaria Subdivision of the Present Comilla district but did not include north Tangail and north-west part of Jamalpur. In 1799 Taluk Amirabad was transferred to Tippera (Comilla). In 1809, Patiladaha, situated north-east of the Brahmaputra came to district form Rangpur. In 1811, the river Banar and Brahmaputra were declared boundary between Dhaka and Mymensingh district and the river Brahmaputra and Meghna as boundary between Tippera (now Comilla) and Mymensingh and Dhaka. In 1811 west Gar-Hills were transferred to Rangpur district. In 1812 Patiladaha, was retransferred to Rangpur. In 1830, Parganas Sarail, Daudpur, haripur, Bejra, and Satarakhandal, were transferred to Tippera and Public convenience. In 1855, due to change in river course part or Serajganj thana was transferred from Mymensingh to Pabna and in 1866, the whole of it was transferred to Pabna. In 1866, thana Dewangajn was transferred to Mymensingh from Bogra and thana Atia from Dhaka. In 1867 for the administrative convenience boundaries of five subdivisions (including Tangail) and thanaswere notified. In 1874 on the basis of survey, the district boundaries were notified. In 1874 the Jamuna (or Daokoba) River was declared the western boundary between Mymensingh and Bogra and as such, 165 villages were transferred to Bogra. In 1875, the Brahmaputra was Made the boundary between Mymensingh and Rangpur and the portion of patiladaha, east of the river, was transferred to this district form Rangpur. In 1877, the Jamuna was declared the boundary between Pabna and Mymensingh, in the west. On the first of December 1969, Tangail subdivision was separated from Mymensingh and a new District of Tangail was formed. Then in 1977 another new district Jamalpur (including Sherpur) was formed.\n\n\nMymensingh district was established in 1787, which was later on reorganised into six districts, namely, Tangail, Jamalpur, Kishoreganj, Sherpur, Netrokona, and Mymensingh. Currently, Mymensingh district has a city corporation, eight municipalities and thirteen upazilas. One of the most eminent District Magistrate and Collectors of Mymensingh district was Gurusaday Dutt, Esq., ICS, the first Indian to come first in any part of the Open Competitive Services Examination then held in England.\n\n\nThe district covers an area of 4363.48 km, with several small valleys between high forests. \n\nThe temperature ranges from 12 to 33 °C, and the annual rainfall averages 2,174 mm. \n\nIt is at the foot of Garo hills of Meghalaya, and includes some \"chars\" (sandy islands) founded on the bed of the Old Brahmaputra River and also some ancient forests of mainly a single wood tree, the sal tree. \n\nThe city of Mymensingh stands on the bank of the Old Brahmaputra, as the 1897 Assam earthquake changed the main flow from Brahmaputra to the Jamuna River which flows west of the greater Mymensingh region. After about hundred years, a port city of sea vessels from England lost its status as the river became a seasonal flow. Some former residences of colonial officials along the side of the river in the city are nowadays government buildings. \n\nThe area of Greater Mymensingh, the north front line is just at the foot of Garo hills of Meghalaya of India, the south this area excludes The Gazipur District, the east ends in the rich watery land of Bangladesh as native calls 'Hawor', the west ends in the ancient single wood forest (e.g. Muktagacha, Fulbaria and Valuka upazilas) and the Chars of Jamalpur District sided north-west of Mymensingh district.\n\nThe Madhupur jungle is a slightly elevated tract, extending from the north of Dhaka district into the heart of Mymensingh; its average height is about 60 ft above the level of the surrounding country, and it nowhere exceeds 100 ft. The jungle contains abundance of sal, valuable both as timber and charcoal. The main benefits of sal is that it can absorb carbon more than any other native trees, so it helps mitigate the severe pollution of Dhaka city. The only other elevated tract in the district is on the northern border, where the Susang Durgapur situated in Netrokona district (part of Greater Mymensingh). Actually the Haluaghat upozilla of Mymensingh is border with India and Garo hills of Meghalaya. They are for the most part covered with thick thorny jungle, but in parts are barren and rocky.\n\nThe Jamuna forms the western boundary of Mymensingh for a course of 94 m. It is navigable for large boats throughout the year; and during the rainy season it expands in many places to 5–6 m in breadth. The Brahmaputra enters Mymensingh at its north-western corner near Karaibari, and flows south-east and south until it joins the Meghna a little below Bhairab Bazar. The gradual formation of chars and bars of sand in the upper part of its course (mainly influenced by The Great Assam Bengal Earthquake 1897) has diverted the main volume of water into the present channel of the Jamuna, which has in consequence become of much more importance than the Brahmaputra proper. The Meghna only flows for a short distance through the south-east portion of the district, the eastern and south-eastern parts of which abound in marshes.\n\nA branch line of the Eastern Bengal railway runs north from Dhaka through Nasirabad etc.\n\nMymensingh town, earlier known as Nasirabad, is on the west bank of Brahmaputra River. The population is around 225,811. Having Bangladesh Agricultural University, Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University, Mymensingh Engineering College, Teachers Training College-Women, Teachers Training College-Both, Government Laboratory High School, Mymensingh, Mymensingh Zilla School, Govt. Mumenunnesa College, Ananda Mohan College, huge bridge on Brahmaputra river, two medical colleges (Mymensingh Medical College, Community Based Medical College), eight high schools, Raj bari, and surrounding farm lands, Mymensingh is one of the best places for living and educating children in Bangladesh. Because there are very few fuel run-vehicles, sound pollution and air pollution levels are very low. There is no public boys college in Mymensingh town; however, every years lots of students from this town get admission in different universities and medical college in Bangladesh. The first military high school for girls in the country, Mymensingh Girls Cadet College, is also located in Mymensingh town. A large amount of land occupied by various churches in Mymensingh city in relation to number of followers.\n\nReligious institutions include 2,362 mosques, 1,020 temples, 600 Buddhist temples, and 36 churches.\n\nZainul Udyan beside the river Brahmaputra, Circuit House Park, Botanical Garden, BAU, Shoshi Lodge are the places visited in the city.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Bangladesh census, Mymensingh District had a population of 5,110,272. Males constituted 49.69% of the population and females 50.31%. Muslims formed 95.79% of the population, Hindus 3.58%, Christians 0.56% and others 0.07%.

Capital of the Tâmega Subregion, the population was 72,265 in 2011, in an area of .\n\nThe region was occupied since pre-history, as evidenced by the proliferation of megalithic monuments, stone settlements and castros. This includes the Menhir of Luzim, a tall stone dating to an occupation of 3–4000 years B.C. Similarly, in the civil parish of Luzim, are the rock engravings that have existed for 3000 years. In addition, there are various rock forts (castros), subject of archaeological studies, such as the archaeological \"city of the dead\" in Citânia de Monte Mozinho. One of the largest in the Iberian Peninsula, it was the precursor to the Galician organized community of \"Cividade Gallaeci\"; the hill fort is dotted with traces of various cultures: Galician-Lusitanian, Roman, Visigoth and Moorish. There different legends that indicate the origins of the name \"Penafiel\", although the common thread associates it with the many forts situated in the locality.\n\nWith the consolidation and incorporation into the Roman world, these hill forts were reorganized and moved down from the hilltops, dispersing into concentrated settlements in open areas and encircled by cultivated parcels, such as in Bouça do Ouro (Boelhe). The Roman spa town of São Vicente do Pinheiro was an example of these centres, developing around the natural resources in the region. In addition, vains of gold interspersed in the Schist and Quartzite quarries attracted Roman settlers from the empire, resulting in an intense artesnal economy, supported by the circulation of a single currency, culture and language.\n\nIn the 9th century, activity became concentrated in the \"Civitas Anegia\" on the headwaters of the Tâmega and Douro, that dominated the lands along margins of those rivers. This civitas was the precursor of Penafiel de Canas, an area that assumed an import role, but occupied a smaller area and embryonic place that concentrated on agriculture and fishing. The lands were seats of the Romanesque ecclesiastical seigneurs of the Benedictine monasteries of Paço de Sousa and Bustelo. Supporting a rich cultural influence, Paço de Sousa boasted a magnificent Romanesque architecture and gave shelter to the historian Egas Moniz Ribadouro, schoolmaster of Afonso Henriques. Other noble houses of medieval period include Barbosa de Honor (Rans), with its tower overlooking agricultural lands, or the transformed tower of Coreixas (Irivo). Romanesque religious architecture proliferated during the post-Roman period; the Romanesque temple of Boelhe or Church of São Salvador da Gândara (venerating a deceased saint's skull) attracted pilgrims to the region, as did the Church of Abragão, the late-Gothic Church of São Miguel da Eja and the funerary memorial of Ermida (Irivo).\n\nDuring this time emerged a new reality: a fortified settlement that developed in the parish of Moazares, home of the Romanesque church of Santa Luzia (circled by sculpted tombs) was along the banks of the rive, along the roadway from Porto and crossing the Sousa at the medieval bridge of Cepeda was an ideal local to build an urban community to specialize in services, artesnal commerce and sale of manufactured goods, supported by a medieval fair. The area was known as Arrifana de Sousa. Legend suggests that name came from the name \"Ariana\" (the daughter of Hermenegildo González and D. Mumadona Dias) who, following her father's death, inherited the land in the 10th century.\n\nAt its founding, it was dominated by two castles: one along the northern bank of the Sousa river, called the \"Castle of Aguiar de Sousa\" and the second along the southern margin, called \"Pena\". The town was attacked several times by Moors, but, owing to its resistance was referred to in Latin as \"Pennafidelis\", shortened to the \"Castle of Penafiel\".\n\nBy the 13th century, many of the plots of land were owned by Castile's ex-Queen Mafalda of Portugal.\n\nThe civil parish of Arrifana de Sousa was established in the sixteenth century. In the same century, in 1519, King Manuel I of Portugal granted the region a foral (\"charter\") that raised the settlement to the status of village. Yet, its change would only occur in the reign of King D. John V (by decree on 7 October 1741).\n\nThe site was crossed by various roads, where João Correia, a rich Portoense merchant with contracts in Flanders established his home; he was a new Christian, who raised a Manueline chapel to the Holy Spirit (and who erected his bronze funerary tomb).\n\nAs it grew, Arrifana assumed as patron saint São Martinho (Marin), and in the middle of the 16th century, a new Mannerist temple was constructed over the old chapel of João Correia.\n\nThe lands continued as an administrative dependency of Porto, until King D. John I conceded it a privilege for supporting his cause.\n\nArrifana de Sousa continued to grow as a centre of services and industry, supported by an annual fair on the feast day of São Martinho, resulting in the expansion of the urban environment to the upper elevations and the construction of the Church of the Misericórdia. Meanwhile, the nobles established their homes outside the town centre, preferring to live in their ancestral estates, established from the land rents and businesses and overseas commerce.\n\nBy law, during the reign of King Joseph (dated 3 March 1770), the place name was officially changed to Penafiel and the status of city conferred.\n\nOn 1 June 1770, by papal bull issued by Pope Clement XIV, the Diocese of Penafiel was established, separating it from the ecclesiastical Diocese of Porto, apparently as suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Braga. rather than pastral reasons, the creation of the see was inspired by the wish of king's de facto reigning Prime Minister, the Marquess of Pombal, to punish the Bishopof Porto by depriving him of most of his diocese- the whole \"comarca di Penafiel\" (administrative district), comprising 102 parishes, even some in \"ferguesias\" (suburbs) of the great (O)Porto port city.\n\nThe Pope appointed the Carmelite Friar Inácio de São Caetano (born 1718.07.31), confessor of the future Queen Maria I of Portugal (then Princess of Brazil), as its first prelate. But he would never administer the Diocese (as he was in Brazil), and was eventually convinced by the Queen to give-up the bishopric, consoled with a nominal promotion as Titular Archbishop of Thessalonica (1778.12.14 – death 1788.11.29), while she successfully requested the Holy See to undo the see creation.\nOn 11 November 1778, Pope Pius VI decided by motu proprio to extinguish the diocese, incorporating its administration (once more) into the mother Diocese of Porto, which it remains part of.\n\nThe Church of Our Lady of Mercy, which had been bombarded its cathedral, lost that status without being made co-cathedral.\n\nIn 1969 the diocese was nominally restored as Latin Titular bishopric of Penafiel (Portuguese) / Pintien(sis) (Latin adjective).\n\nIt has had the following incumbents, mostly of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank, \"with an archiepiscopal exception :\n\nThe municipality extends within an area of , in a confluence of river valleys marked by the Douro, Tâmega and Sousa Rivers, connecting the littoral region and the Transmontana zone. It is a landscape of deep valleys, with intense irrigated zones and pasturelands, with fields encircled by forests of pine and eucalyptus. This inter-fluvial region have granite soils and is rich in water resources, permitting intensive agriculture and extraction industries. The southwest extension of the municipality include a complex of Schist and Greywacke geology, resulting in mountainous, uncultivated and largely forest lands.\n\nAn intermediary zone, dividing the littoral and mountainous regions, the region was an important transitory point, with lines of communication extending along inter-regional, land and fluvial networks. The first example was the \"royal roadways\" that date to the medieval period, that connect Porto and the Trás-os-Montes, that resulted the development of the urban centre, that was a fulcrum in supporting transiting peoples and goods. The Douro was an important link and penetrated the interior, while the flanks of the Alto Douro were used to produce vineyards. The \"Entre-os-Rios\" district was also an important part in supporting travel along the interior.\n<br>\n\nWith 28 civil parishes it includes a resident population of 72,000 inhabitants (approximately 338.4 people per kilometre square), integrated into the \"Associação de Municípios do Vale do Sousa\" (\"Vale de Sousa Municipal Association\")and NUTSIII Tâmega Subregion. The region is settled, but in dispersed enclaves, supported by small industry and commerce, while newer residential homes juxtaposition older rural dwellings. These older homes are usually maintained by part-time farming families and seniors, perpetuated by intense migration and facilitated by their proximity to major roadways.\n\nThe municipality is administered by the following civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\n\n\nThe parishes are, largely, semi-industrialized, with a mixture of modern homes and rural dwellings in nature. Villages have houses made with small stones and granite, both of which are common in locality of Penafiel.\n\nExtraction industries, civil construction firms and commerce employs a large number of workers, in addition to a strong concentration of service sector activities, confirmed by a Penafiel's central place in the regional economy.\n\nPenafiel invested in new schools and renovating others during the 20th century, maintaining several kindergartens, primary and secondary schools.\n\nThe municipal council is responsible for maintaining several health centres, clinics and hospital, with Padre Américo Hospital situated in the parish of Guilhufe.\n\nThe council has some train stations in their territory of buses throughout the country and a vast road system.\n\nPenafiel is the centre for therapeutic treatments and spas, highlighted by the São Vicente Spa and the Inatel Entre-os Rios Spa. The São Vicente is known for the characteristic quality of its waters: the spa is known for the hyper-mineralized waters, that include concentrated sulphurous and carbonaceous akline silicates and fluoridated water. It is considered the most alkaline among the sulphurous waters of Portugal and Europe, with temperatures of about , advocated for the treatment of respiratory diseases and musculo-skeletal system ailments.\n\nOne of the largest Portuguese is located in Penafiel: Magikland, formerly Bracalândia (and had moved from Braga), where it prospered.\n\nTourism is cyclical in the region, influence by the staggering of religious and secular activities, but marked by special events throughout the year, particularly around the religious feast of São Martinho. This includes the literary festival \"Escritaria\" and the agricultural fair \"Agrival\", which had its basis in the traditional medieval fairs.\n\nThe region of Penafiel is known for a history dating to the pre-historic period, marked by dolmens, petroglyphs, necropoli and fortified settlements constructed of stone. But, over time and through the influence of various cultural groups (Romans, Visigoths, Moors) the area began to evolve into a modern centre, marked by the evolution in its architecture from rudimentary stone dolmens to signeurial manorhouses and monumental estates.\n\nPenafiel began building its library in 1863. On 6 June 1917, a new Municipal Library of Penafiel was inaugurated, located on Avenue Araújo e Silva, which closed in October 1919, reopened to the public on 6 June 1927 and was transferred to a small lounge on Avenida Sacadura Cabral.\n\nThe most popular/practised sport within the municipality is football (soccer), leading hundreds of young people to the existing clubs. The largest club, FC Penafiel, was founded in 1951 and has regular presence on many levels of professional Portuguese seasons. During the 2014–2015 season, the club played in the Premier League after obtaining a rise from the previous season, finishing in 3rd place behind Moreirense (Champion) and FC Porto B.

The song uses the word \"Gasolin\", however the word does not exist in the German language, but it is an English word made German. There was, however, a German chain of gas stations called \"Gasolin.\" \n\nBenzin was Rammstein's first number one single, getting to number one in Finland after its release in 2005.\n\nIn the video, Rammstein are firefighters. They have not had a call for a long time, and are thus very ill-equipped for dealing with an emergency. They enter a huge, three-lane-wide fire-engine, and set off on their journey, not taking any notice of the damage they are causing, or the people they are killing. They plow through high-voltage power-lines, trains, trees and normal road vehicles; despite this, the truck remains unscratched.\nDuring the journey, the scene changes to a fantasy by guitarist Paul H. Landers, during which he saves a \"damsel-in-distress\" from a burning building. During this fantasy, the band members are seen playing their instruments in the background amongst the smoke.\nThe scene returns to the Fire-engine, plowing through traffic and buildings before it overturns and sends the band-members crashing through the windscreen. As Till comes round, a man points to the top of a nearby building. It dawns on them that they have crashed right outside the emergency.\nThey scramble to get a safety trampoline out for the jumper, who happens to be Christian \"Flake\" Lorenz. The trampoline rips just as he jumps, at which point the video ends, implying the man's death seconds later - the actual event likely considered too graphic to include - and thus the destruction up to that point having achieved nothing.\n\nThe song was first played live in the Reise, Reise tour on 23 June 2005 in Berlin's Wuhlheide , months before its release. It replaced Moskau on the setlist. Benzin was played on the next two nights, lyrics changing a little bit even from one night to the next. Theatrical flames shot twenty metres into the air during those live performances. It was then played in the non-festival concerts until the end of the tour, but this time without any pyrotechnics. However, as of the Liebe Ist Für Alle Da tour, Benzin has returned to being performed with pyrotechnics, including a flamethrower disguised as a petrol pump. By the end of the song Till Lindemann uses it to set a 'fan' on fire, who runs through the stage until the song is over.\n\nAll songs by Rammstein.\n"}

Adults have bright red bills and a dull yellow ring around their eyes. Their backs are dull olive green, and they have a bright yellow-orange throat with a yellow chin; females are somewhat duller than males, and juveniles have black bills. It has also been introduced in various parts of the world, with small populations of escapees having existed in Japan since the 1980s. It has become a common cagebird and amongst aviculturists it goes by various names: Pekin robin, Pekin nightingale, Japanese nightingale, and Japanese (hill) robin, the last two being misnomers as it is not native to Japan (although it has been introduced and naturalised there).\n\nThe leiothrix is about six inches in length, generally olive green, and has a yellow throat with orange shading on the breast. It also has a dull yellowish ring around the eye that extends to the beak. The edges of the wing feathers are brightly colored with yellow, orange, red and black and the forked tail is olive brown and blackish at the tip. The cheeks and side of the neck are a bluish gray color. The female is a lot paler than the male and lacks the red patch on the wings. It doesn't fly frequently, except in open habitats. This bird is very active and an excellent singer but very secretive and difficult to see.\n\nThe leiothrix is usually found in India, Bhutan, Nepal, Burma and parts of Tibet. This species is a bird of the hill forests, found in every type of jungle though it prefers pine forests with bushes. It has also been found at elevations ranging from near sea level to about 7,500 feet. In Japan it prefers forests of \"Abies\" and \"Tsuga\" with a dense understorey of bamboo.\n\nThe species was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1918 and spread to all the forested islands except Lanai. Its population on Oahu crashed in the 1960s and it disappeared from Kauai, but is now common and increasing on Oahu. The leiothrix was released in Western Australia but it failed to become established. This species was also introduced in Great Britain but permanent establishment was unsuccessful. It was introduced to France, where it is now established in several areas, and Spain where it is increasing and spreading from the Collserola Park. In Japan, naturalised populations of what is probably the nominate subspecies this species have been recorded since the 1980s and it has become established in central and southwestern Japan. It is also established on the Mascarene island of Réunion.\n\nThe presence of the avian malaria parasite has been found in the blood of this species.\n\nThis bird feeds on animal matter. It eats fruits such as strawberries, ripened papaya, guavas and also various species of Diptera, Mollusca, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera. Its food is usually gathered from foliage and dead wood and it usually searches for food in lower strata of vegetation.\n\nThe leiothrix can usually be found in a group of about ten to thirty birds during the non-breeding season; however, during the breeding season the birds break off into pairs and become territorial. These birds have a song which consists of short powerful notes that are repeated continuously throughout the year but it is more persistent during the breeding season. This period usually lasts from early April until September and they are usually found around well watered areas. The males sing long complex songs with a wide array of syllables to attempt to attract the female.\n\nThe leiothrix is an open cup nester. The nests of the red-billed leiothrix are composed of dry leaves, moss and lichen; however, they are not well hidden because concealment isn't really a primary factor when determining a nest site. Several nests are found between April and June and are placed within ten feet of the ground. Dense vegetation provides the shrub nesting species protection against predators.\n\nThe eggs of the leiothrix are found in clutches of two to four eggs with an average of three. They are broad and blunt in shape with some gloss on the outside and they also have a pale blue color and red like brown spots that encircle the larger end of the eggs. The newly hatched birds have bright red skin and a rich orange red gape.\n"}
{"id": "2137828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2137828", "title": "Cold inflation pressure", "text": "Cold inflation pressure\n\nCold inflation pressure is the inflation pressure of tires before the car is driven and the tires warmed up. Recommended cold inflation pressure is displayed on the owner's manual and on the placard (or sticker) attached to the vehicle door edge, pillar, glovebox door or fuel filler flap. 40% of passenger cars have at least one tires under-inflated by 6 psi or more. Drivers are encouraged to make sure their tires are adequately inflated, as suboptimal tire pressure can greatly reduce fuel economy, increase emissions, increased wear on the edges of the tire surface, and can lead to premature failure of the tire. Excessive pressure, on the other hand, may lead to impact-breaks, decrease braking performance, and cause uneven wear (i.e., greater wear on the center part of the tire surface).\n\nTire pressure is commonly measured in psi in the imperial and US customary systems, bar, which is deprecated but accepted for use with SI or the kilopascal (kPa), which is an SI unit.\n\nAmbient temperature affects the cold tire pressure. Absolute cold tire pressure (gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure) varies directly with the absolute temperature, measured in kelvins.\n\nFrom physics, the ideal gas law states that \"PV\" = \"nRT\", where \"P\" is absolute pressure, \"T\" is absolute temperature, \"V\" is the volume (assumed to be relatively constant in the case of a tire), and \"nR\" is constant for a given number of molecules of gas. To understand this, assume the tire was filled when it was 300 kelvins (approximately 27 degrees Celsius or 80 degrees Fahrenheit). If the temperature varies 10% (i.e., by 30 kelvins [also 30 degrees Celsius or 54 degrees Fahrenheit]), the pressure varies 10%. So if the tire was filled at 80 °F to 32 psi (or 47 psi absolute when we add atmospheric pressure), the change would be 4.7 psi for this 30 Celsius degree change, or 0.16 psi per Celsius degree or 0.1 psi per Fahrenheit degree or 1 psi for every 10 Fahrenheit degrees. Using SI units, that would be 1.1 kPa/K.\n\nHence, for a tire filled to 32 psi, the approximation usually made is that within the range of normal atmospheric temperatures and pressures:\nTire pressure increases 1 psi for each 10 Fahrenheit degree increase in temperature, or conversely decreases 1 psi for each 10 Fahrenheit degree decrease in temperature and\nin SI units, tire pressure increases 1.1 kPa for each 1 Celsius degree increase in temperature, or conversely decreases 1.1 kPa for each 1 Celsius degree decrease in temperature. For tires that need inflation greater than 32psi it might be easier to use a Rule of Thumb of 2% pressure change for a change of 10 degrees Fahrenheit.\nFrom the table below, one can see that these are only approximations:\n\n"}

{"id": "2137836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2137836", "title": "Cornering force", "text": "Cornering force\n\nCornering force or side force is the lateral (i.e., parallel to the road surface) force produced by a vehicle tire during cornering. \n\nCornering force is generated by tire slip and is proportional to slip angle at low slip angles. The rate at which cornering force builds up is described by relaxation length. Slip angle describes the deformation of the tire contact patch, and this deflection of the contact patch deforms the tire in a fashion akin to a spring.\n\nAs with deformation of a spring, deformation of the tire contact patch generates a reaction force in the tire; the cornering force. Integrating the force generated by every tread element along the contact patch length gives the total cornering force. Although the term, \"tread element\" is used, the compliance in the tire that leads to this effect is actually a combination of sidewall deflection and deflection of the rubber within the contact patch. The exact ratio of sidewall compliance to tread compliance is a factor in tire construction and inflation pressure.\n\nBecause the tire deformation tends to reach a maximum behind the center of the contact patch, by a distance known as pneumatic trail, it tends to generate a torque about a vertical axis known as self aligning torque.\n\nThe diagram is misleading because the reaction force would appear to be acting in the wrong direction. It is simply a matter of convention to quote positive cornering force as acting in the opposite direction to positive tire slip so that calculations are simplified, since a vehicle cornering under the influence of a cornering force to the left will generate a tire slip to the right.\n\nThe same principles can be applied to a tire being deformed longitudinally, or in a combination of both longitudinal and lateral directions. The behaviour of a tire under combined longitudinal and lateral deformation can be described by a traction circle.\n\n"}

His brothers Philip and Herbert were also tennis players.\n\nSears learned to play tennis in 1879. He was undefeated in the U.S. Championships, he won the first of his seven consecutive titles in 1881 while still a student at Harvard. In those days the previous year's winner had an automatic place in the final. Starting in the 1881 first round, he went on an 18-match unbeaten streak that would take him through the 1887 championships, after which he retired from the game. Not until 1921 was his 18-match unbeaten run overtaken (by Bill Tilden). During his first three championships Sears did not lose a single set.

The aircraft, a Vickers Viscount 803 named \"St. Phelim\", crashed into the sea off Tuskar Rock, County Wexford. Although the investigation into the crash lasted two years, a cause was never determined. Causes proposed in several investigative reports include possible impact with birds, a missile or target drone, or mechanical and structural failures.\n\nAer Lingus still uses this flight number for a daily flight from Cork to London Heathrow, contrary to airline convention of discontinuing a flight number following a crash. The route is operated with an aircraft from the Airbus A320 family.\n\nThe flight left Cork Airport at 10:32 hours for London. The flight proceeded normally until a call was heard with the probable contents \"twelve thousand feet descending spinning rapidly\". There was no further communications with the aircraft and London ATC informed Shannon ATC that they had no radio contact with EI-AOM. London ATC requested Aer Lingus Flight EI 362 (flying Dublin-Bristol) to search west of Strumble. This search at in good visibility saw nothing. At 11:25 a full alert was declared. By 12:36 there was a report of wreckage sighted at position 51°57′N, 06°10′W. Searching aircraft found nothing and the report cancelled. Aircraft and ships resumed the search the following day and \"wreckage was sighted and bodies recovered\" north-east of Tuskar Rock with more wreckage scattered \"for a further 6 nautical miles north-west\".\n\nThirteen bodies were recovered over the next few days. Another body was recovered later.\nThe main wreckage was located on the sea bed by trawling from Tuskar Rock at 39 fathoms.\n\nThe aircraft was a Vickers Viscount 803 which flew under tail-number EI-AOM and had been in service since 1957 with a total of 18,806 lifetime flight hours. Aer Lingus operated approximately 20 Viscount aircraft in the 1950s and 1960s, of which two others were involved in serious incidents. The year before the Tuskar Rock crash, in June 1967, an 803 Viscount on a training flight crashed (due to a stall) with the loss of 3 crew lives. Also in 1967, in September, an 808 Viscount was damaged beyond repair during a crash landing (due to pilot error in fog) that caused no serious casualties.\n\nThe crew of EI-AOM Flight 712 included Captain Bernard O'Beirne, 35, who had joined Aer Lingus after three years in the Air Corps. His total flying time was 6,683 hours, 1,679 of them on Viscounts. He was endorsed for command on Viscount aircraft and passed a medical in January 1968. The first officer was Paul Heffernan, 22, who had training with Airwork Services Training at Perth and joined Aer Lingus in 1966. That year, he received an Irish Commercial Pilots licence with Viscount endorsement and instrument rating. His total flying time was 1,139 hours, of which 900 was on Viscounts. The two stewardesses on board were Ann Kelly and Mary Coughlan.\n\nAll 61 of the persons aboard the aircraft died. In total, only 14 bodies were recovered from the St George's Channel following the crash.\n\nAn investigation report was produced in 1970. A review was undertaken between 1998 and 2000. An independent study was commissioned in 2000.\n\nOf the several reports issued on the potential causes of the crash, several causes were proposed. These included possible bird strike, corrosion or similar structural failure, or collision with a target drone or missile. The latter causes were based on the proximity of Aberporth in west Wales – at the time the most advanced missile testing station in Britain.\n\nIn the years following the crash, several witnesses came forward in support of the missile theory. These include a crew member of the British ship HMS \"Penelope\" who alleged that part of the recovered wreckage was removed to the UK.\n\nHowever, in 2002 a review process conducted by the AAIU (Air Accident Investigation Unit) disclosed that Aer Lingus paperwork relating to a routine maintenance inspection carried out on the aircraft in December 1967 was found to be missing in 1968. Moreover, a large body of research was done by the investigators after the accident, regarding the maintenance operating plan used for EI-AOM and defects on the aircraft found during analysis of the maintenance records. This research was not referred to in the 1970 report. A new board of investigation was set up by the Irish Government and found that the crash was likely the consequence of a chain of events starting with a failure to the left tail-plane caused by metal fatigue, corrosion, flutter or a bird strike, with the most likely cause being a flutter-induced fatigue failure of the elevator trim tab operating mechanism.\n\nIn March 2007, retired RAF Squadron Leader Eric Evers made an unsupported claim that the accident was caused by a mid-air collision between the Aer Lingus Vickers Viscount and a French-built military aircraft which was training with the Irish Air Corps. Evers maintained that he had evidence that a Fouga Magister trainer accidentally collided with the Aer Lingus aircraft as it was checking the status of the Viscount's undercarriage, which he claimed had failed to lock in position correctly. According to Evers, the Magister's two pilots survived by ejecting and parachuting to safety; however Magisters do not have ejector seats. Evers' claims, including that French and Irish authorities colluded in a cover-up, have been strongly refuted by other commentators. For example, Mike Reynolds, an aviator and author of \"Tragedy at Tuskar Rock\", disputed Ever's claims and supports the findings of the 2002 French/Australian investigation – which ruled-out an impact with another aircraft or missile. This study, on which Reynolds worked as Irish assistant, concluded that the cause may have been as a result of structural failure of the aircraft, corrosion, metal fatigue, flutter or bird strike. An Irish Defence Forces spokesman similarly described the Evers' claims as \"spurious\", noting that there was no evidence that an Irish Air Corps plane was in the vicinity at the time, and that Magisters did not actually enter service with the Irish Air Corps until 1976.\n\n\n"}

In her younger years, she specialized in portrait miniatures. It is for this that she was able to build a career in portraiture. Carriera would later become known for her pastel work, a medium appealing to Rococo styles for its soft edges and flattering surfaces. She is remembered as one of the most successful women artists of any era.\n\nBorn in Venice with two sisters, Rosalba Carriera was a prominent and greatly admired portrait artist of the Italian Rococo. Her family was from the lower-middle-class in Venice, and as a child, she began her artistic career by making lace-patterns for her mother, who was engaged in that trade. However, when interests in lace waned and the industry began to falter, Carriera had to find a new means of providing for herself and her family.\n\nThe popularity of snuff-taking gave her an opportunity to do just that. Carriera began painting miniatures for the lids of snuff-boxes, and was the first painter to use ivory instead of vellum for this purpose. Gradually, this work evolved into portrait-painting, for which she pioneered the exclusive use of pastel. Prominent foreign visitors to Venice, young sons of the nobility on the grand tour and diplomats for example, clamored to be painted by her. The portraits of her early period include those of Maximilian II of Bavaria; Frederick IV of Denmark; the 12 most beautiful Venetian court ladies; the \"Artist and her Sister Naneta\" (Uffizi); and August the Strong of Saxony, who acquired a large collection of her pastels.\n\nBy 1700 she was already creating miniatures and by 1703 she completed her first pastel portraits. In 1704, she was made an \"'Accademico di merito\"' by the Roman Accademia di San Luca, a title reserved for non-Roman painters.\n\nBy 1721, Carriera's left Venice for Paris, as portraits by her were in great demand. While in Paris, Carriera was a guest of the great amateur and art collector, Pierre Crozat. She painted Watteau, all the royalty and nobility from the King and Regent downwards, and was elected a member of the Academy by acclamation. Her brother-in-law, the painter Antonio Pellegrini, married to her sister Angela, was also in Paris that year. Pellegrini was employed by John Law, a Scottish financier and adventurer, to paint the ceiling of the Grand Salle in Law's new Bank building.\n\nCarriera's other sister, Giovanna, and her mother, were members of the party in France. Both sisters, particularly Giovanna, helped her in painting the hundreds of portraits she was asked to execute. This was because she undertook a lot of work in order to support her family. Carriera's diary of these 18 months in Paris was later published by her devoted admirer, Antonio Zanetti, the Abbé Vianelli, in 1793. Her extensive correspondence has also been published.\n\nIn the short time she spent in Paris, her work contributed to forming the new aristocratic tastes of the court and by extension, the tastes of Parisians. No longer did art serve only the monarchy's needs. Her freedom, colorfulness and charms were injected into the Rococo style (which she was the face behind) which soon dominated the arts.\n\nDespite her triumph in Paris, she returned to her home in Grand Canal, Venice in 1721. Carriera, with her sister Giovanna in tow, visited Modena, Parma, and Vienna, and was received with much enthusiasm by rulers and courts.\n\nIn later life, Carriera made a long journey to the royal court in Vienna, Austria. While there, Holy Emperor Charles VI became her benefactor and was fully committed to supporting her work. The Emperor amassed a large collection of more than 150 of her pastels. In return, the empress worked underneath her and received formal artistic training. The works she executed there were later to form the basis of the large collection in the Alte Meister Gallery in Dresden.\n\nAfter her sister Giovanna's death in 1738, Carriera fell into a deep depression which was not aided by the loss of her vision (which might have been damaged by miniature-painting in her youth) some years later. She underwent two unsuccessful cataract surgeries but ended up losing her vision completely. She outlived all her family, spending her last years in a little house in the Dorsoduro district of Venice, where she died at the age of 84.\n\nBy the time of her death, the Rococo style was not as popular as before. Despite this, she was still a strong influence for many of the women artists that came after her, such as Catherine Read, Adélaïde Labille-Guiard and Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun.\n\nCarriera's mother taught her the art of lace making, but the artworks she became famous for were a result of her own self learning. Despite this, there is much speculation surrounding her education in art. It is said that the French painter Jean Steve encouraged her to make miniatures on ivory to decorate the lids of snuffboxes. Some also claim that she received initial instruction in oil technique from the Venetian painter Giuseppe Diamantini.\n\nDespite this, Carriera would share her talents with her sisters Giovana and Angela and later in life had female students as Marianna Carlevarijs, Margherita Terzi and Felicità Sartori.\n\nCarriera's influence would spread widely among many. In 1720 she provided King Louis XV with a portrait that completed the transition from the previously accepted style of the court. It was a shift between what looked powerful and a decorative style with international appeal. She revolutionized the world of technology by binding colored chalk into sticks, which led to the development of a much wider range of prepared colors. This expanded the availability and the usefulness of the pastel medium.\n\nAlthough negatively dubbed \"‘The Rococo’\" by Maurice Quai, a follower of the neoclassicist Jacques-Louis David, Carriera played an important role in popularizing the style in France and later England, where George III was a major collector of her work.\n\nDespite her renown and contribution to an established manner, Carriera is \"often treated as an exception, a rarity as a woman artist\" and very often ignored. When the Rococo went out of mode, Carriera's name and her impact was dismissed and that had very much to do with gender as well.\n\nRosalba Carriera is one of the main characters appearing in the novel \"The Laws of Time\" (2019) by Andrea Perego.\n\nCarriera was the first female painter to initiate a new style in the art community. The Rococo style emphasized the use of pastel colors; spontaneous brush strokes, dancing lights, subtle surface tonalities and a soft, elegant and charming approach to subject matter. She was known for dragging the sides of white chalk across an under-drawing of darker tones to capture the shimmering texture of lace and satin. She was also able to highlight facial features and the soft cascades of powdered hair. Because of her, artists created work in the style for nearly a century.\n\nCarriera had many patrons who were interested in her work. Her earliest known pastel portrait depicts the collector Anton Maria Zanetti (1700) who procured many works by the artist and promoted her to other collectors when he travelled throughout Europe. Joseph Smith was another one of her admirers and he too collected a great amount of her works. King George III later purchased these pieces in 1762. That collection contained one of many of her self-portraits.\n\nHer best-known self-portrait is one she contributed to the Medici collection of self-portraits at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. This piece was different because she veered away from idealizing herself, as was a custom of the era. Instead, she was brusque and honest in her representation, featuring a larger nose, thin lips and a deep dimple in her chin. She holds a portrait of her sister and assistant Giovanna, whom she was very close to.\n\nHer self-portrait work diverges from typical expectations of women artists of the time by aiming for an unvarnished appearance. One such example is \"Self-Portrait as an Old Woman\" (1746), whose mismatched eyes hint at the eye problems which plagued her in later life.\n\nCarriera was not just a portrait painter, even though that was her subject matter of choice due to her profession. She also created a few allegorical pieces, including \"‘The Four Seasons’\", \"‘The Four Elements’\" and \"‘The Four Continents’\". These allegories were represented by beautiful, nymph like and barely clothed women holding symbols that referenced the meaning of the piece.\n\nCarriera was best known for her innovative approach to pastels, which had previously been used for informal drawings and preparatory sketches. She was also credited with pastel as a medium for serious portraiture that redefined the Rococo manner.\n\n\n"}

He was one of the very few Loyalists to achieve any sort of national prominence in the United States after the American Revolution, and is best remembered for his role in the treason trial of former Vice President Aaron Burr in 1807.\n\nJohn Wickham was the oldest son of John Wickham Sr. and his wife Mary Smith Fanning. Wickham was born in the colony of New York in the village of Cutchogue. His father was a minister in the Anglican Church and a Loyalist, while his uncle Parker Wickham was also a Loyalist, and was active in the local government.\n\nAfter the American Revolution, Parker Wickham was banished from New York State under an act of attainder. Despite vigorously declaring his innocence, Parker Wickham was never granted a trial and was sentenced to death if he returned to New York. The unfairness of this bitter event gave John Wickham a lifelong appreciation of the sanctity of a person's legal rights, regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nAlthough John Wickham was a first cousin of Revolutionary War hero Nathaniel Fanning, he was heavily influenced by his uncle Edmund Fanning, a colonel (later a general) in the British Army. Fanning raised a unit called the King's American Regiment, which Wickham served in as an ensign. While traveling through Virginia, Wickham was captured and put on trial as a spy, but acquitted.\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, Wickham earned a degree in law from the College of William and Mary, where he became a close friend of John Marshall, later fourth Chief Justice of the U.S.. Wickham moved to Richmond and experienced tremendous financial success helping British merchants collect debts from American businessmen. He married his first cousin Mary Smith Fanning and had two children. After her early death, he married Elizabeth Seldon McClurg and had seventeen more children. McClurg was the daughter of Dr. James McClurg, Richmond Mayor, U.S. Congressman, and a delegate to the Philadelphia Convention, which framed the Constitution of the United States in 1787.\n\nIn 1807, Wickham was lead counsel for Aaron Burr in his trial for treason. Although Thomas Jefferson took an active role in trying to have his former Vice President executed, Burr was found innocent. Wickham's old friend John Marshall was the presiding judge.\n\nWickham bred racehorses. The best and most famous of them all was Boston, which he lost in a card game. Boston became one of the greatest horses of his time, and sired the greatest stud, Lexington.\n\nHis interment was located in Richmond's Shockoe Hill Cemetery. Wickham's numerous descendants continued to be active in Virginia affairs. His grandson Williams Carter Wickham was a Confederate general, and served as the first president of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. His granddaughter Charlotte Wickham was married to William Henry Fitzhugh Lee, the son of General Robert E. Lee. Wickham's residence, Wickham House, is now part of the Valentine Richmond History Center.\n\n"}

{"id": "2137932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2137932", "title": "Dushyanta", "text": "Dushyanta\n\nDushyanta () is a king in classical Indian literature. He was the husband of Shakuntala and the father of the Emperor Bharatha. He appears in the \"Mahabharata\" and in Kalidasa's play \"The Recognition of Sakuntala\" (c. 300 CE). His name is also transliterated as \"Dusyanta\" or \"Dushyant\", and means \"Destroyer of Evil\" in Sanskrit.\n\nAccording to the \"Mahābhārata\", Dushyanta is the son of Ilina and Rathantara. He was king of Hastinapur and ancestor of the Kuru dynasty. Dushyant met his wife Shakuntala while on an excursion from his kingdom at the hermitage of sage Kanva. Dushyanta and Sakuntala had a son named Bharata who went on to become an emperor.\n\nThe story of Dushyanta's encounter, marriage, separation and reunion with his queen, Shakuntala, has been immortalized in the \"Mahabharata\" and in \"The Recognition of Shakuntala\" by the great Sanskrit poet Kalidas.\n\nDushyant meets Shakuntala, who is a daughter of Vishvamitra and Menaka, while on an excursion from his kingdom. Depending on the source, Dushyant is either the crown prince, or he is waiting to win back his kingdom from an enemy. Either way, he sees Shakuntala in an ashram (hermitage) of Rishi Kanva and falls in love. He and Shakuntala have a gandharva marriage there. Having to leave after some time, Dushyant gives Shakuntala a royal ring as a sign of their love, promising her that he will come to her.\n\nBut when Dushyant becomes king, he becomes too absorbed for many years in affairs of state. Shakuntala waits and despairs. One day, sage Durvasa visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her. A shocked Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance.\n\nSo, Shakuntala sets off to the capital, Hastinapur, to remind Dushyant of their past love. An accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof.\n\nDushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala, but his memory and love are rekindled when a sage (not the same who cursed Shakuntala) recovers the ring and brings it to the court. Dushyanta weds Shakuntala, who becomes his queen and mother of his son, Bharata.\n\nA different version of the story involves Shakuntala's father, the great and legendary sage Vishwamitra, who is said to have bowed his head to none. Dushyant's forgetting of Shakuntala was a device invented by the other sages, including Vashishta, to make Vishwamitra bow. For the sake of his daughter the great sage is said to have bowed before the great king Dushyant to persuade him to accept his daughter. The sages, delighted, immediately brought the memory of Shakuntala into the mind of Dushyant.\n\nAccording to many literary sources, Dushyanta was the father of Bharata, who is generally credited with uniting India under his rule (see origin of India's name). According to the \"Mahābhārata\" Adiparva, Bharata was born while Shakuntala awaited Dushyanta at her hermitage. A fisherman catches the same fish who had consumed the ring. His wife wants to make curry out of it, while cutting up the fish she finds the ring and takes it to the king. The King then remembers Shakuntala and sets out in search for her.\n\nHindi Book Dushyant Ki Shakuntala by Pradeep Sharma\n"}

Her father, Grady Steely, was a school teacher who also owned a local movie theater. At age 7 her family moved to Greensboro, Alabama. At age 12 they moved to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where she attended Harding Junior High School and Classen High School. She also worked in a U.S. Army induction center as a stenographer. She left that job to study acting at Oklahoma City University, after watching the film \"Wuthering Heights\", and saved up money for a two-week trip to Hollywood, where she hoped to begin a movie career. She told a Boston Globe reporter in 1946 that she first became interested in acting after seeing Janet Gaynor in \"A Star is Born\" at age 14, and that she played Juliet in a college production of \"Romeo and Juliet\". \n\nDuring her brief trip to Hollywood she was spotted at a drugstore by a man who turned out to be the agent of Samuel Goldwyn. Although a screen test indicated a thick southern accent, Goldwyn was impressed with her appearance and put her under contract. He sent her for acting and diction lessons, and had her cast in local plays, including a \"Pasadena Playhouse\" dramatization of \"Little Women.\" She later changed her name to Cathy, which was the name of the female protagonist in Wuthering Heights. She then changed her last name to O'Donnell, because it was recommended by Goldwyn's wife, who claimed that audiences loved actors and actresses with Irish last names.\n\nO'Donnell appeared on stage in Boston in \"Life With Father\" in 1944, and made her film début in an uncredited role as an extra in \"Wonder Man\" (1945).\n\nO'Donnell's first major film role was in 1946's highly acclaimed \"The Best Years of Our Lives\", playing Wilma Cameron, the high-school sweetheart of Navy veteran Homer Parrish. Homer was played by real-life World War II veteran and double amputee Harold Russell.\n\nO'Donnell was loaned out to RKO for \"They Live by Night\" (1948), one of her most memorable films. Farley Granger played her love interest. The film is widely considered a classic of the \"noir\" genre, and is on the \"Guardian\" list of the top ten noir films. It was directed by Nicholas Ray. The two actors were later re-teamed for \"Side Street\" (1950).\n\nLater O'Donnell starred in \"The Miniver Story\" (also 1950), as Judy Miniver and also had a supporting role in \"Detective Story\" (1951). She appeared as Barbara Waggoman, the love interest of James Stewart's character in the western \"The Man from Laramie\" (1955). Her final film role, and perhaps her most famous part, was in \"Ben-Hur\" (1959). She played the part of Tirzah, the sister to Judah Ben-Hur. The film won a record 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, in 1959.\n\nIn the 1960s, she appeared in TV shows, appearing on shows such as \"Perry Mason\", \"The Rebel\" and \"Man Without a Gun\". Her last screen appearance was in 1964, in an episode of \"Bonanza\".\n\nThen 24-year-old O'Donnell married 47-year-old Robert Wyler, the elder brother of film director William Wyler, on April 11, 1948.

The city sits along the seasonal Ngadda River which disappears into the \"Firki\" swamps in the areas around Lake Chad. Maiduguri was founded in 1907 as a military outpost by the British and has since grown rapidly with a population exceeding a million by 2007.\n\nThe region was home to the Kanem-Bornu Empire for centuries. Maiduguri actually consists of two cities: Yerwa to the West and Old Maiduguri to the east.\n\nYerwa was founded in 1907 by Abubakar Garbai of Borno as the capital of the Bornu Kingdom. The location had before that been a small village known as Kalwa. This involved the transfer of the capital of the Kanuri people from Kukawa.\n\nOld Maiduguri was selected by the British as their military headquarters in 1908 replacing Mafoni. In that same year it became the location for the British resident commissioner over British Bornu.\n\nIn 1957 Yerwa became the designated name for the urban center while Maiduguri was officially applied as the name of the surrounding rural area.\n\nIn 1964 the railway was extended here which lead to its rise as a major commercial center in the region.\n\nThe city was once known as a \"hub of Islamic scholarship in West Africa that ... [taught] tolerance and hospitality like its welcoming neem trees.\"\n\nMaiduguri is one of the sixteen LGAs that constitute the Borno Emirate, a traditional state located in Borno State, Nigeria.\n\nSince the mid-1960s, Maiduguri has witnessed outbreaks of large inter-religious riots. Members of religious sects led intercommunal violence in 1982 and 2001.\n\nOn 18 February 2006, riots related to the Muhammad cartoons published by the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten left at least 15 people dead, and resulted in the destruction of approximately 12 churches. Soldiers and police quelled the riots, and the government temporarily imposed a curfew.\n\nIn 2002, Muslim cleric Mohammed Yusuf founded the Islamist group Boko Haram in Maiduguri, establishing a mosque and a madrasa that attracted children from poor Muslim families from both Nigeria and neighboring countries. \n\nThe city is the heart of the Boko Haram insurgency and is the city which is most often attacked by the group. In late July 2009, Maiduguri was the worst-hit location of major religious violence in northern Nigeria committed by Boko Haram, which left over 700 people dead.\n\nOn 14 May 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency in northeast Nigeria, including Borno State, due to the militant activity of Boko Haram. The entire city was under overnight curfew, and trucks have been prevented from entering the city. Twelve areas of the city that are known to be strongholds of Boko Haram are under permanent curfew. On 18 June 2013, Boko Haram militants attacked a school as students were taking an exam; nine students were killed.\n\nIn 2014, Boko Haram bombed Maiduguri in January, July and November.\n\nOn 10 January 2015, a bomb attack was executed at the Monday Market in Maiduguri, killing 19 people. In the early hours of 25 January, Boko Haram launched a major assault on the city. On 26 January, CNN reported that the attack on Maiduguri by \"hundreds of gunmen\" had been repelled, but the nearby town of Monguno was captured by Boko Haram. The Nigerian Army claimed to have successfully repelled another attack on Maiduguri on 31 January 2015.\nOn 17 February 2015, Monguno subsequently fell to the Nigerian military in a coordinated air and ground assault.\n\nOn 7 March 2015, five suicide bomb blasts left 54 dead and 143 wounded. On 30 May 2015, Boko Haram launched another attack on the city, killing thirteen people.\nIn March 2017 Boko Haram again bombed Maiduguri.\n\nThe Giwa barracks and detention centre in Maiduguri has been subject to multiple attacks by Boko Haram. In 2014, reports suggested that 600 people were killed in an attack, though most were detainees killed by soldiers. It was attacked in January/February 2015, bombed in March 2015, and attacked again in May 2015.\n\nIn May 2016, Amnesty International released a report on the Giwa barracks detention centre, calling it a \"place of death.\" The report alleges the facilities house about 1,200 people (including 120 children) and that many of these were detained arbitrarily. It further claims that 149 detainees had died in the first half of 2016, including 11 children. In 2019, Ammesty International (AI) and Concerned Nigerians (CN) called for investigation into alleged abuse of women and children in the facility.\n\nTramadol addiction has become a concern in the Maduguri region, as Boko Haram fighters and local residents turn to the drug to cope with physical pain, personal loss, and the emotional consequences of violence.\n\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot semi-arid (BSh).\n\nThe highest record temperature was on 28 May 1983, while the lowest record temperature was on 26 December 1979.\n\nTree planting was a priority of the city's colonial administration, and large trees along major roads give protection from intense sun.\n\nMaiduguri is estimated to have a population of 1,907,600, as of 2007. It grew in size by 15.1 square kilometers between 2002–2012.\n\nIts residents are mostly Muslim including Kanuri, Hausa, Shuwa, Bura, Marghi, and Fulani ethnic groups. There is also a considerable Christian population and people from Southern states such as the Igbo, Ijaw, and Yoruba.\n\nMiduguri had 22 internally displaced persons camps in 2019, including Shagari camp with 48 households, and Cherubim & Seraphim camp with 65 households.

Immediately after the match, an enraged Bischoff fired Morrus and the three men who made the save.\n\nShortly after, the \"released\" wrestlers reappeared in WCW under their new M.I.A. names.

Rection, Guerrero as Lt. Loco, LeRoux as Cpl. Cajun, and Van Hammer as Major Stash. They were given a valet in former fitness model Tylene Buck, who went under the name Major Gunns. The group mainly feuded with The Filthy Animals, Team Canada, and The Natural Born Thrillers. Gunns feuded with the Filthy Animals' valet Tygress. Other members were added as the group's popularity rose over the final years of the company. In July 2000, Hammer was released from WCW. On the July 26, 2000, episode of WCW Thunder, The Wall would be added as Sgt. AWOL. On the November 13, 2000, episode of WCW Monday Nitro, Gunns eventually betrayed the group in favor of turning heel by joining Team Canada, when she threw in the towel on the behalf of Rection, costing him the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship against Lance Storm. The group disbanded in January 2001.\n\n\n\n"}

Villa Crespo celebrates its anniversary on June 3.\n\nVilla Crespo was also sometimes referred to as Palermo Queens around 2007. This trade name, caused a reaction from the Neighborhood Association and Historical Studies at the Ombudsman of the city of Buenos Aires. They issued Resolution 2549/07, resulting in 14 realtors being sanctioned for publishing misleading advertising, in violation of the consumer competition law and fair trading law, and violation of the law of neighborhood boundaries and the tourist protection law. Palermo is considered a more expensive neighborhood and renaming Villa Crespo as part of Palermo would allow people to charge higher rents, etc.\n\nIt grew around the \"Fábrica Nacional de Calzado\" (\"National Shoe Factory\", 1888). The first name of the neighborhood was San Bernardo and that remained in general use during its first twenty-five years, in spite of it being officially named after Buenos Aires mayor, Antonio F. Crespo. On April 11, 1894, the San Bernardo church was opened to the public. Villa Crespo was home to several conventillos, including the most famous one, the \"Conventillo de la Paloma\".

{"id": "2137998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2137998", "title": "Avengers Mansion", "text": "Avengers Mansion\n\nAvengers Mansion is a fictional building appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It has traditionally been the base of the Avengers. The enormous, city block-sized building is located at 890 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, New York City.\n\nAvengers Mansion's address is 890 Fifth Avenue in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. According to Stan Lee, who co-created the Avengers:\n\nLee later recounted, \"I can't tell you how many fan letters I would receive from kids saying, 'We came to New York and we were looking for the Stark mansion and couldn't find it. What address is it?' [\"laughs\"] So that made me feel good. I felt we had accomplished our objective. We had made it seem realistic.\" In real life, 890 Fifth Avenue is 1 East 70th Street, the location of the Henry Clay Frick House, which houses the Frick Collection. The building is, like Avengers Mansion, a city block-sized mansion.\n\nWhen occupied, the mansion was originally the Stark family manor, until their only son, Tony Stark, inherited their fortune and soon took on the guise of Iron Man. He donated the mansion to the Avengers and had it financed through the charitable Maria Stark Foundation. It was primarily looked after by the Stark family butler, Edwin Jarvis, who not only took care of the mansion but also catered to the needs of the Avengers team. It served as a place to plan and strategize and a home for Avengers members when they needed it.\n\nIt had three above-ground floors and three basement floors. The first three floors were open to the public and had twelve rooms to house Avengers who wished to reside in the mansion, as well as Jarvis's quarters. A portion of the mansion's third floor served as a hangar for the Avengers' quinjets, their primary mode of transportation.\n\nThe three floors below ground were restricted from the public and had modified rooms for the Avengers' needs. Such rooms below ground were: Howard Stark's \"Arsenal\" chamber, the Avengers gym, Hawkeye's test-shooting room, the training room (much like the X-Mansion's Danger Room), the cryogenic storage area, a vault to contain Jack of Hearts's power, and the ultra-secure assembly room.\n\nThe Fantastic Four took up temporary residence at Avengers Mansion after their headquarters (the original Baxter Building) was destroyed.\n\nThe mansion has been destroyed twice. The first time was in \"Avengers: Under Siege\" when a huge grouping of Masters of Evil, led by Baron Helmut Zemo, attacked the Avengers and destroyed the Mansion and beat Hercules into a coma among other things before being repulsed.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, the Avengers would relocate to a floating platform called Hydro-Base, while the former Mansion site became known as \"Avengers Park\", and was unused. Hydro-Base was later destroyed as well.\n\nThe Mansion would be featured in a \"Damage Control\" story. The reconstruction firm was hired to refit and rebuild the mansion, a task they accomplished easily. Unfortunately they did not manage to move it as easily and it fell into one of New York's rivers.\n\nLater, the Avengers built a new headquarters on the site of the Mansion and resided there until it was destroyed by the Gatherers, a team of alternate universe Avengers. Ute, a Watcher enslaved by the villain Proctor, brought an alternate reality version of the original Avengers Mansion to the site as a dying gift.\n\nThis replacement Mansion would survive various assaults until, in the \"\"Avengers Disassembled\"\" storyline, the Scarlet Witch was responsible for its destruction by bringing an undead version of Jack of Hearts that exploded, also killing Scott Lang, the second Ant-Man, and in \"Avengers Finale\" (January 2005), Stark decided that with his dwindling assets, he could no longer afford to maintain the building and it was abandoned in its derelict state, left as a memorial to the Avengers who had died. Stark, using his considerable political and social influence, had the grounds declared a landmark by the city of New York. Since then, the Young Avengers have restored much of the statuary on the grounds of the mansion. The Avengers have relocated to Stark Tower, although it is unknown how permanent this move will be, especially in light of the events of Marvel's \"Civil War\" storyline, which causes the virtual splitting of the New Avengers down the line between those who were pro-registration and those who were against it.\n\nEven after its destruction, the mansion remains a hub of superhuman activity. The Young Avengers were attacked by, and later defeated, Kang the Conqueror there. They later restored the many statues in the mansion's grounds, adopting the mansion as their meeting place.\n\nDuring the highest tensions of the \"Civil War\" incident, Iron Man and Captain America meet at the ruins in order to talk things out. They tour the grounds and even find abandoned framed photographs of old allies.\n\nFormer Avenger Clint Barton has made his way on to the grounds several times since then, most recently following Captain America's death. He meets with Tony Stark to discuss the implications of Steve Rogers' assassination.\n\nAfter the Skrull invasion, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s replacement agency H.A.M.M.E.R. kept an eye on the mansion in case the Young Avengers, still wanted for refusing to be registered, showed up. The young group did anyway, using the building as a central point for many meetings.\n\nFollowing the Siege of Asgard and at the start of the \"Heroic Age\", Steve Rogers and Tony Stark sold the mansion to Luke Cage for a dollar allowing him freedom to recruit his own Avengers team and operate from the mansion while the other Avengers team operate from the Infinite Avengers Mansion and Avengers Tower. After an extended period, and severe damage thanks to Daniel Drumm the New Avengers dissolve, and Cage sells the mansion back to Stark for five dollars.\n\nAfter yet another roster reshuffling, the mansion was refitted as the headquarters for the new Avengers Unity Squad which is funded by Janet Van Dyne. A computerized A.I. system called J.A.R.V.I.S. is installed to replace Edwin Jarvis (who still lives in Avengers Tower with the main team).\n\nFollowing the reconstruction of the multiverse, the mansion officially became a theme hotel as the Avengers teams move on to other bases, but they were unaware that the Red Skull and Sin are hiding in a secure room under the mansion, carrying out an unspecified plan. After this, the mansion was purchased by Unity Squad member Johnny Storm with the money he had inherited from his apparently dead brother-in-law's patents, who created Avengers Mansion Inc. to run the property on behalf of the Avengers.\n\nThe Mansion was surrounded by a wall twelve feet high and one foot thick, as well as an array of high-tech security defenses. A main feature of the defenses were large, restrictive coils. These were sometimes backed up by energy beams that shot out from the ground. Nonetheless, those defenses were often breached by the supervillains faced by the Avengers. Shortly after the Avengers moved into the Mansion, Iron Man and Thor moved the Mansion 35 feet away from the street, increasing the size of the front lawn and giving the Avengers more privacy.\n\nWhen Tony Stark was the United States' Secretary of Defense, the mansion's security systems were backed up by government forces.\n\nThe mansion's grounds featured an array of statues of past and present Avengers, constructed out of adamantium. The statues were destroyed in a battle with the Asgardian god, Loki. One of the trees on the grounds used to hold a miniature lab belonging to Hank Pym. The statues return around the time the 'New Avengers' leave the mansion.\n\n\nThe Infinite Avengers Mansion was created by Hank Pym in the pocket dimension where Thor sent Janet Van Dyne's body at the end of Secret Invasion. It was the headquarters of Hank Pym's Mighty Avengers and was home to the Avengers Academy.\n\n\n\n"}
